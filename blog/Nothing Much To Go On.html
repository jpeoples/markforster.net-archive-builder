<h1>Nothing Much To Go On</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2013-10-14 18:30</div>
<div class="content"><p>For anyone interested I’ve just started a new blog called <em><a href="http://nothingmuchtogoon.postach.io/">Nothing Much To Go On</a>. </em>It’s a much more personal blog than this one and will cover just about everything I’m interested in without any reference to what you the reader might be interested in (Be warned!)</p>
<p>However one of the things I <em>am</em> interested in is time management and personal organization, so you may pick up a few gems now and then.</p></div>

<div>Best of luck with your new venture Mark, I'll be checking it out. Maybe with your latest developments this site may be winded down? Whatever, I do wish you well.</div>
