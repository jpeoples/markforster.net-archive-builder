<h1>High Volume, High Speed, Low Resistance - 3</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2017-07-3 23:55</div>
<div class="content"><p>Page count at the end of day 2:</p>
<p>1-15 - 0</p>
<p>16 - 22</p>
<p>17 - 28</p>
<p>18 - 24 (out of 28)</p>
<p>Total: 74</p>
<p>That’s 95 tasks worked on today, including every one of the 61 tasks remaining from yesterday.</p>
<p>The list has now been further consolidated down to three pages by the system, which is the smallest number of pages that this number of tasks can fit on.</p>

<div>Ooh, you tease! I'm super excited to try this one :) Hope it continues to work well throughout your testing.</div>

<div>The "consolidated" bit has me intrigued. I've been using Fast Final Version? (scan the long list, dot what stands out, immediately work on it) and when I run out of pages on my notebook I consolidate it down:<br><br>-Get new notebook<br>-Choose only one item from each page of old notebook<br>-Transfer those items to new notebook<br>-Shred/burn/destroy old notebook<br><br>It's weirdly freeing and fun, plus it pares things down to the important in an easy way. I wonder if you're doing something similar.</div>

<div>@Jesse: I don't think so. I suppose Marks new mehod has some similarities to my method, which I described here: <a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2017/7/1/high-volume-high-speed-low-resistance.html#comment21756160" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2017/7/1/high-volume-high-speed-low-resistance.html#comment21756160</a> <br><br>The footprint of his method on consolidating tasks is something I experience too. The "main train" of tasks leaves only single tasks behind, which can't be actioned right now. A longer group of tasks is only uncoupled when I jump to an urgent task in the middle of the list, but this block is taken care of during the next pass. Consolidation acquired! :-)</div>

<div>Jesse:<br><br>No, no resemblance. I think I said it doesn't involve any preselection.</div>
