<div>I have been using Autofocus for a while now and it has improved my productivity by an order of magnitude. This yahoo group is interesting - I would encourage more users of Autofocus to sign up and contribute.<br><br>I am particularly looking to compare notes with people who, like me, are using Autofocus to run major projects with many teams and conflicting priorities and issues. These defeated all my previous time management systems - but Autofocus seems to thrive on them - the more the better in fact!<br><br>So if you are such a user - can I encourage you to join the yahoo group and post so we can compare experiences and we can maybe help each other?<br><br>Paul  (aka Zytex1 on yahoo)</div>
