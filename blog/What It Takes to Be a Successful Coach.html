<h1>What It Takes to Be a Successful Coach</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2007-07-31 11:38</div>
<div class="content"><p><em>I wrote this article several years ago about coaching. However most of what I said applies to other businesses too, and bears repeating.</em></p><p>During the time I have been a coach, I have been regularly astonished by two things. The first is how little some quite well-known coaches are earning after years of being a coach. The second is how quickly some other people start earning large sums of money at coaching.<br><br>I have noticed that it is frequently possible to identify the people who are going to “fly” the second they come onto the scene, well before they start being successful.<br><br>So here is a list of things I think these people have in common. Not all of them of course will have all these qualities in equal measure, and I am sure there are other factors which I have omitted.<br><br>* They see coaching as a business, and take a business attitude to it. <br><br>* They are quite clear about what they want to achieve, and work to long-term (3-5 years) rather than short-term goals. <br><br>* They know it takes time and effort to build a business, and they start putting that time and effort in straightaway. <br><br>* They adequately fund their business. <br><br>* They are confident in their own abilities, particularly their business abilities. <br><br>* They concentrate more on improving their business than on improving their coaching (though obviously the two go hand-in-hand; it is a matter of emphasis). <br><br>* They see marketing as their number one priority. <br><br>* They find ways very early on of distinguishing themselves from the common herd. <br><br>* And without any exception I can think of, they are excellent public speakers. <br><br>It all goes back to what I’ve written before: our <em>profession</em> is coaching; our <em>business</em> is selling coaching services. </p></div>

<div>As a senior manager who is planning to move from operations into organisational development (HR, facilitation, appreciative inquiry and coaching), this is timely and pertinent advice.  Was this past of a longer article - if so, is it available to read on line?<br></div>

<div>Thanks for the tips, Mark. I rated pretty good, but the reminders are welcome, esp. re: the business side.</div>
