<h1>Working Live on this Blog Tomorrow</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2009-09-3 12:40</div>
<div class="content"><p>Tomorrow I am going to try something entirely new (to me) by working my Autofocus list on-line so that you can see how it should be done.</p>
<p>I will start the day off by posting my current list on this blog - and then every time I take action on a task or add a new one I will up-date the post. That way you will be able to keep track of exactly what I am doing at any given time.</p>
<p>I will be using the new unreleased Version 4, which I am currently testing, so you can see how fast and powerful it is.</p>
<p>Timings (very approximate):</p>
<p>Start: 8am UK Time</p>
<p>Finish: 11pm UK Time</p>
<p>I hope the exercise will show the following:</p>
<p>- the speed and flexibility of the system</p>
<p>- the various levels at which I enter tasks</p>
<p>- the nature of the tasks which are suitable for an Autofocus list</p>
<p>I will also leave Comments open so that hopefully a dialogue will develop about what is happening.</p>
<p> </p></div>

<div>Very interesting idea, but I'm not sure I'll be able to follow the show the whole day. Will it be than still available later? -- In other words, will be all the intermediate states of the task list visible or only the last, current state?</div>

<div>"Forgive my ineptness, but did I miss version 3.0?"<br><br>I think version 2 wasn't around long so perhaps you missed that.  I think there has been:<br><br>Original AF - work through list as page at a time treating each page as a distinct unit<br>AF Version 2 - treat the the list as a single unit, always begin at the most recent entry and work backwards<br>Revised AF aka Version 3 - a combination of the first two versions where you switch between two modes (reverse with one long list and forward treating each page as a separate unit)<br><br>HTH<br><br>Looking forward to Version 4.0 and like the idea of 'watching' you work it,<br>Thanks<br>Lucy</div>

<div>I'm very excited about this, Mark! What a great idea, and I look forward to seeing v.4 in action!</div>

<div>Very curious about this 4.0 version, esp. the various levels at which tasks are entered and the nature of the tasks which are suitable for an Autofocus list.</div>

<div>trying to find a way to catch the differences within the article trough the day by RSS or something like that. I'm out all day tomorrow but am very curious. Maybe someone here knows how to do this?</div>

<div>Hello Mark - Any chance this live webcase-type event could be recorded for download later? I really want to be here but have a lecture to attend.</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">JD - 2009-09-3 15:40</div>
<div>Ah - my mistake, its via blog posts. I can catch the various posts later.</div>

<div>Any chance you would pre-release notes on the differences of V.4 so that we can understand better what and why you are doing in real time?<br><br>Love the process.  Keep it up!</div>

<div>Too bad this demonstration is on a working day. I'd love to follow it but have no option to take a day off at such a short notice. I use V3 of Autofocus every day and just can't wait to get my hands on the new, improved V4. I hope Mark doesn't put us on the racks for too long before presenting the new version to us in detail. :-))</div>

<div>JD:<br><br><< Ah - my mistake, its via blog posts. I can catch the various posts later. >><br><br>Just to make it clear. It's one blog post which will be updated throughout the day. So you won't be able to follow it later, though you will be able to see the final results!</div>

<div>Richard:<br><br><< I'd love to follow it but have no option to take a day off at such a short notice.>><br><br>I never envisaged anyone taking the day off to follow it - it would be pretty boring if you did!<br><br>It's more a case of looking at the blog at intervals throughout the day to see how I'm progressing.</div>

<div>Mark:<br><<I never envisaged anyone taking the day off to follow it - it would be pretty boring if you did!>><br><br>Well, as a true GTD-freak I don't think so. ;-) During work I don't have the possibility to visit your blog so I'm unfortunately gonna miss most of the progress, because the same blogpost will be updated till evening. On a day off I could keep the progress page open while finishing my errands and refresh it every now and then. <br><br>Is there a chance that (at least a preliminary version of) V4 will be published this weekend to ensure we can start next weeks workload with a fresh organisatorial breeze?</div>

<div>Richard:<br><br>I will be numbering the items in the order I do them, and also putting a running commentary. So it should be quite easy to follow, I hope. You can see the list I will be starting with on my next blog post.<br><br>If you do follow it you should pick up the basics of the system - perhaps even all of it as it is pretty simple!</div>
</div>

<div class="comment-meta">JD - 2009-09-4 4:03</div>
<div>Thanks for that explanation Mark. Can't afford to miss it, so I will following your blog on my laptop while listening to a lecture :)</div>

<div><<If you do follow it you should pick up the basics of the system - perhaps even all of it as it is pretty simple!>><br><br>That sounds great. I've been using Autofocus with great success since the first version and the current V3 is (by now) the best version. If V4 provides further enhancements I can't wait to implement it in my daily workflow.</div>

<div>Mark,<br><br>You are nothing if not innovative.  What a truly interesting idea!<br><br>Perhaps someone out there will copy and past updates into a simple file then post it somewhere as a journal  ....  fascinating.</div>
