<div class="content"><p>Following the example of <a href="https://youtu.be/UZ2jczhC2VY">some book publishers</a>, I’ve decided to start writing in my<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/8883707206/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1"> large Moleskine unlined notebook</a> sideways on. The result is that I get a writing surface which is as wide as an A4 sheet and slightly shorter. As a writing surface it’s beautiful - which is more than can be said for my handwriting!</p>
<p><em>(I always have trouble with the size descriptions of Moleskine notebooks. They come in three sizes, Pocket, Large and Extra Large - which any normal person would call Small, Standard and Large respectively.)</em></p>

<div>Moleskine also does A4 plain  notebooks so you can in effect get an A3 page to scribble on by using the 2 pages side on. Apologies to US readers on site not sure where A4 and A3 sit re folio, legal etc</div>

<div>skeg:<br><br>A4 is a bit longer than letter and a bit shorter than legal.<br><br>A3 is the equivalent of ledger/tabloid.</div>
