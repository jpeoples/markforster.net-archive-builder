<div>Mark, I'm so pleased that DIT will be available in the US. I recommend it to my organizing clients often, but they seem to find ordering it from the UK challenging.<br><br>Before you place the call to the publisher about How to Make Your Dreams Come True, be sure to check your publishing contract. At least here in the US, the issue of rights reversion is usually spelled out in the contract. It's my experience that the request has to be made in writing. Best of luck with that!<br><br>Janine</div>

<div>Hi Mark,<br><br>I came across your blog awhile back and was intrigued by the title of your book: Do It Tomorrow. Being a collector of time management techniques, I couldn't help but buy it from Amazon.com. I also bought Forget the 7 Habits and Break All the Rules. This one caught my interest because I work for FranklinCovey and Stephen Covey is the author of The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People.<br><br>I liked your ideas about time management. I've adapted  them for use with my Franklin Planner. I'll be blogging about your book in the near future and with your permission I will promote your ideas in my upcoming workshops through Project Management Northwest. Do you have any tips from your own workshops?</div>

<div>Hi, Janine<br><br>Thanks for the kind words about DIT. I have had a lot of enquiries from people in the States about how best to get hold of the book, so it's really good news from my point of view.<br><br>You are right about the contract. I can give written notice to the publishers to reprint, and if they don't signify their intention to do so within six weeks I can terminate the agreement - again in writing. But since they've already told me that they don't intend to reprint they may not require me to go through all that palaver!</div>

<div>Dear Theresa<br><br>I'm delighted that you have found the ideas in DIT of use to you. I'll write to you about the seminars separately by email.<br><br>Mark</div>

<div>Mark,<br><br>I'd urge you to progress the repint of How To Make Your Dreams Come True. Having just reread it on holiday after a first read two years ago I'd forgotten just how good it is. I really enjoyed the way it is written and how it goes deeper as the book progresses. It is a very different book from your other two and one that I'd recommend to anyone. It's reminded me about Pull mode and spurrred me on to work on a cohesive narrative goal rather than my current list of discrete goals.<br><br>Looking forward to more and regular blog and article updates.<br>Regards,<br>Jonathan</div>

<div>Hi Mark,<br><br>I'd echo Jonathan's words -- push for a reprint! *How to Make Your Dreams Come True* is in many ways my favourite of your books. I still remember reading it for the first time at university a couple of years ago, and my copy is now getting somewhat dog-eared...<br><br>Though, if you do publish it as an e-book, I'll certainly be pointing US friends towards it. :-)<br><br>Best,<br><br>Ali</div>

<div>Jonathan and Ali, <br>Thanks for your kind remarks re "Dreams". I will be taking action on this just as soon as the publisher releases it back to me (they have agreed to do so). I will probably take the opportunity to update and revise it a bit.<br>Mark</div>

<div>I'm glad to hear it's coming out in the US. Our household ordered it from the UK. My partner has started implementing some of the techniques at work & some of his coworkers have started also.<br><br>All the best,<br>Les</div>

<div>Dear Les<br><br>Thanks for the post. I would be delighted to hear of some of the experiences you all have had with the methods if you feel like writing more.<br><br>Mark</div>

<div>Mark,<br>Will the US/Amazon distribution DIT in Nov08 be the same as that available now from the UK? I am eager to read the full book, and don't want to wait until Nov to get a copy (unless the Nov08 version is significantly different)<br><br>Many thanks.<br><br>-- John</div>

<div>John:<br><br>As far as I am aware the DIT book which Trafalgar will be distributing will be identical to the one on sale in the UK. I've not been approached for any new material, and I don't think they have any plans to produce an "americanized" edition.</div>

<div>Mark, any news on this? I'm re-reading this at the moment and am sure that many others would like to get hold of it - have you seen the second-hand prices? TIme to dig our your secret stash of kept-back copies :)<br><br>I'm adding Goal Achievement Method updates, dialoguing and What was better about today tasks to AF as I'd love to see how this can help pull together AF and these higher-level ideas.<br><br>"<br>Jonathan and Ali,<br>Thanks for your kind remarks re "Dreams". I will be taking action on this just as soon as the publisher releases it back to me (they have agreed to do so). I will probably take the opportunity to update and revise it a bit.<br>Mark<br>June 7, 2008 | Registered CommenterMark Forster<br>"</div>

<div>Jonathan:<br><br>Well I did start to update and revise it a bit and the result was Autofocus!</div>
</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Jonathan in London - 2009-01-17 18:32</div>
<div>Mark, thanks for replying. I have to say AF is looking something special, interesting to hear that it's grown out of "Dreams" rather than just being an extension of DIT to a page approach.</div>

<div>Mark<br><br>I posted a comment about this blog entry in the discussion forum but wasn't sure if it was more appropriate to post it as a reply here.<br><br>Here's the link to the forum entry:<br><br><a href="../general_forum/Dreams, DIT and Autofocus.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/633332</a><br><br>Basically I was curious about what you said here:<br><br>"Jonathan:<br><br>Well I did start to update and revise it a bit and the result was Autofocus! <br>January 15, 2009 at 19:39 | Mark Forster"<br><br>I'd love to hear more detail from you about how revisiting "Dreams" turned into Autofocus. I love the new system as it's so simple and elegant. Even though other things have got in the way a bit lately so I haven't had a great deal of time for my Autofocus list it has really helped me to regain the 'focus' I felt I had been lacking of late.<br><br>So thanks again for such a great system and I'd love to hear more about the metamorphosis from "Dreams" to Autofocus...</div>

<div>Hannah:<br><br>I think that would be very difficult to describe, and I'm not sure I could do so in any way which would make sense to someone else.</div>
