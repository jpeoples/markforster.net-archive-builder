<h1>Update on the New Question</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2021-01-30 6:58</div>
<div class="content"><p>I’ve been hard at work experimenting with the best ways to use the <a href="../blog/A New Question for FVP, Simple Scanning and Life in General.html">New Question</a>, and I want to share my findings - with the proviso that this is what works for me so far. You may find other ways are better for you.</p>
<p>There are two ways in which I am using the Question at the moment with a great degree of success: </p>
<ul>
<li>As the question in <a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2015/5/21/the-final-version-perfected-fvp.html">FVP</a>, where it is used in the form “What am I resisting <em>not</em> doing more than x?” My experience using it this way is that it is best to scan fast, and dot tasks only when I get a strong “hit”. This is the best way when I am in my office sitting at my desk tackling a large amount of work.</li>
<li>As a stand alone question in the form “What am I resisting <em>not</em> doing?” This is faster and more flexible, but difficult to keep up for an extended period of time. So I find it is best for:      
<ul>
<li>Times when I am away from my desk and my office</li>
<li>Informal occasions</li>
<li>Breaking down a selected task or project into small actions</li>
<li>Selecting routes when I am walking in the countryside.</li>
<li>Any occasion when I just need to make up my mind what to do next.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve decided to modify the <a href="../blog/Lent 2021.html">Lent Challenge</a> so that entrants can use the Question with any system or systems. The idea will be to report back on your experiences both as you go along and at the end of the Challenge.</p></div>

<div>I wish there were a way to combine long-list system with journaling. Right now I keep a list in the back of my notebook and journals in the front. If you could FVP through your journals somehow it'd centralize the capture location for thoughts and allow for more long-form captures there. <br><br>Then again I don't do any Morning Pages and if I did I'd do it separately.<br><br>I personally review my journals weekly and seasonally or so for content and index in the front a la Tim Ferriss: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFdR8w_R1HA</div>

<div>I recently tried the question "Which task/project can be completed soonest?" This helped me focus on bringing closure on some items, which felt good.  I tried this approach for just a few hours today, and I found the completion of the tasks to be very energizing.   I'm not sure how effective this will be for a longer period of time though as the tasks/projects become more complex and time consuming as I work the list.</div>

<div>Seth,<br><br>A while back a member named Gerry posted about his Ultra Simple Guide to Time Management.  I can't find that guide here, only links to sites that have been discontinued.  The short of it I think was, you take meeting notes for example, and have a simple margin code (E.g., write a '+' ) to indicate things that require action.  You work those items highlighted in the margin.  Gerry didn't recommend fancy ways of doing those marginalia, but you probably could pull off FVP using your appropriately marked up journal, which will include these margin notes, odd tasks you write in yourself, and references to page numbers or whatever.</div>

<div>I put in an attempt at operating without a list, and while I can ordinarily act spontaneously with some success, trying to do so while asking this "What am I resisting not doing" lead me to inaction.  Nothing came to mind, and so I didn't not do anything.  I think.  I am relieved to return to following a list of tasks.</div>

<div>I wonder if something like a "bullet journal" would do the trick. Also, I remember keeping a moleskin journal with absolutely everything in it - calendars, task lists, project pages, all entered as you go. I loved it at first but after a while, it started getting tedious. I wish I could remember the reference to it. I don't even remember what it was called.</div>

<div>I love the idea of a bullet journal so much, but I can never put it into practice, much for the same reason as you, Paul.<br><br>If you google "bujo" you will find so much. Here's a link to the original video:<br><br><a href="http://youtu.be/fm15cmYU0IM" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://youtu.be/fm15cmYU0IM</a></div>

<div>Yes, it's Bullet Journal. It's grown into a huge community, with, not surprisingly, many variations. There are several groups that share ideas for ways to organize information on paper.<br><br>Rapid Logging is a common component; you write things as you think of them. Daily reflection is part of the official version, but isn't popular. In both modes, you write things down as you think of them, and add codes (bullets) in the margin so you can find them when needed. https://bulletjournal.com/pages/learn<br><br>Many people use a more complex set of bullets, so it's easier to find things when needed, eg project ideas, health, shopping, meeting. "Migration" is moving things to other lists, eg shopping, do in July, do Today, project notes, reading log.<br> <br>It works with long list systems (although you need to redefine "page" for AF1 since it starts with so few on each page). I usually collect all open tasks every month or three, so I can see them in one place.<br><br>+++<br><br>It's good to see everyone again.<br><br>"How do I feel about the consequences of not doing this?" feels right to me.<br><br>I'd add a time frame. "How do I feel about the (possible) consequences of not doing this now / today / this week / month / year / lifetime?" I need to expand "possible" sometimes. Maybe the possibility of wonderful results is hidden behind the fear of something not going as well.<br><br>++++<br><br>I really like "What would I regret not having done?” or "Will I regret not having done this?"</div>

<div>It occured to me just now that children resist NOT doing things all the time:<br><br>- Don't leave the place in a mess<br><br>- Don't dawdle on the way home<br><br>- Don't make your little sister cry<br><br>- Don't leave your homework until the last minute<br><br>etc etc etc</div>

<div>True, but do you think asking them this question will help?  Do you think teaching them to ask the question will help?  Or is this a question for maturity?</div>

<div>Alan Baljeu:<br><br>I wasn't aiming the question at children at all. I was trying to clarify what "resisting not doing" means, as many people have claimed that the concept is difficult to understand.</div>

<div>Mark:<br><br>Glad to see that this question is still on your radar. <br><br>I used "What am I resisting not doing?" (with no list) during Lent Challenge. In some ways, this wasn't a success. The question stressed me out in that I would ask it too often (quasi-obsessively). Maybe it was also a little stressful in that it really got me working and kicked my butt! But in other ways, the question was a wild success: I finished a major written project ahead of deadline, etc. Something to remember, since I've been searching for ways to speed my pace of work.<br><br>Dreams has been working very nicely for me and I don't want to stop that. But if some reason I need to switch things up in the future, I think "What am I resisting not doing?" would be worth a second try.<br><br>I haven't seen much discussion of the question recently, but, imo, it's a powerful idea. Perhaps some found the wording counterintuitive, but I found no way to improve on it. Maybe you will find a revised wording. But, for me, "What am I resisting not doing?" has a certain magic.<br><br>Anyway, just some user feedback for what it's worth (two cents).</div>

<div>The concept is valuable, but I have been unable to have a firm enough mental grasp to use it in flow.  I think the difficulty is with grasping all the negations implicit.  As I deconstruct the phrase "what am I resisting not doing" I imagine "what do I not want not done".  It's hard to grasp.  <br><br>I think a simpler conception might simply be "Heed your conscience".  That certainly applies to the examples for children, though again that phrase it might not be understood by the very young.  The problem with using this phrase is it tends to direct against certain actions rather than towards certain actions, but if taken with a sense of "What ought I do now", you might not know if you asked that directly, but if you keep a sensitive spirit and then turn to watch TV, the Ought may just tap on your shoulder.</div>

<div>Alan Baljeu:<br><br>My experience as the father of three children is that "Heed your conscience" would be considerably less effective than "Don't leave the place in a mess", etc.<br><br>I don't personally find "what do I not want not done?" at all difficult to understand. <br><br>Did you never have said to you as a child "I don't want to come home and find that you haven't tidied up your mess"? Did you as a child have any difficulty understanding the meaning?</div>

<div>Hi Mark,<br><br>My own experience using "What am I resisting not doing?" is described in my post above (December 9, 2021) on this thread. I used it as a stand-alone question with no list.<br><br>As I said, the question was in some ways a wild success but it was tricky to implement in that one might ask it "quasi-obsessively."<br><br>It occurred to me to ask a point of clarification. I don't believe you discussed this in your original post: With this question, what is the endgame? Is the idea that you would ask the question to choose all of your actions (and spur your work) for a relatively short period of time (say, weeks-months), THEN you would be at the point where you have subconsciously internalized the question and no longer ask it? At this stage, you are in tune with you own innate resistance to NOT doing things and act accordingly? A bit like entering pull mode in the Dreams? (Though perhaps "What am I resisting not doing?" might feel more like push!)<br><br>I ask because it seems to me that one disadvantage of a stand-alone question is the difficulty of needing to continually ask it, which might take up a lot of mental energy compared to a system like, say, Simple Scanning. And yet, I think "What am I resisting not doing?" is a powerful and special idea. It might hit at something that is not quite captured in your other systems. In short, I found it insightful--even if it may be tricky to implement.<br><br>I suppose the above commentary could apply (mutatis mutandis) to any other stand-alone question (e.g. "What am I resisting?" from GED).</div>

<div>I have lighted on an interpretation that doesn’t cause mental confusion:<br><br>Say no to everything.  If saying no to anything causes anguish, do that.</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Alan Baljeu - 2022-01-15 16:59</div>
<div>This clarifies things tremendously.  Immediately I come to the next thought: What if I also resist doing it?  What if the thing I resist not doing is “eat another donut” or “steal that thing”?  These are things I should ultimately never do, so “what am I resisting not doing” is not a sufficient decider. <br><br>I suppose in such cases the answer is to deliberately (i.e. with deliberation) engage the question of your motivations.  Rather than let your internal conflict brew, ponder the issue until you either clearly don’t resist doing it, or no longer resist not doing it.  Or more simply, you want to do it, and do, or you don’t want it done and don’t.</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Belacqua - 2022-01-15 18:40</div>
<div>Alan:<br><br><< What if I also resist doing it?>><br><br>This would be normal. As I understood it, Mark's whole insight was that we resist doing something AND resist not doing that thing at the same time. E.g. Writing a report: You resist doing it because it sucks and it's hard work. But you resist not doing it as well. Inside you there's strong resistance to letting it drag out, having it hang over your head, or to other negative consequences of the report not getting done:<br><br><a href="../blog/A New Question - Examples.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2021/1/19/a-new-question-examples.html</a><br><br>As I interpret it, the question is an attempt to short-circuit the resistance we feel to doing something by getting us to focus instead on the resistance we feel to not doing it. In my experience, this resistance to not doing is a powerful motive force if untapped. I recall that Mark said the key word in the question is "resisting"--"What am I RESISTING not doing?"--and I have found that emphasis to work the best.<br><br>I still find the question tough to implement though (as mentioned above). I suspect it might be too demanding or stressful to use repeatedly or regularly throughout one's life.</div>

<div>Alan:<br><br><< What if the thing I resist not doing is “eat another donut” or “steal that thing”? These are things I should ultimately never do, so “what am I resisting not doing” is not a sufficient decider. >><br><br>I think most people (in most circumstances) will not feel resistance to NOT stealing something (in plain English: they won't feel compelled to steal). Whether the question would help a kleptomaniac, etc. I'll leave aside.<br><br>As for "eat another donut"... After my trial of Mark's question (last Lent Challenge) I observed:<br><br><< sometimes I would "resist not doing" some things that were merely trivial and nagging even though they could be left undone. Similarly with fun things: sometimes, I felt palpable resistance to not doing them even though the negative consequences wouldn't be so bad. >> <br><br>I think this applies to "eat another donut,"--you have a point. But I don't see how this is different than any other system. All of us have done ill-advised things from time to time using a system like Simple Scanning. That doesn't invalidate a system. Presumably, we "live and learn"--and make better choices in the future (once we overcome indigestion from the donut). Now, if a system is getting in the way of us making good choices that is a problem. But I'm not sure that's the case here.</div>

We just move from one action to the next. That's why (I was thinking) it might be good if one could tap into one's resistance to not doing things without actually having to ask the question... Kind of like in "standing out" one doesn't actually ask "What do I feel like doing now?"; you just pick a task. Or in the same way No-Question FVP might be easier than asking "What do I want to do more than X?" every time. Or as in "Dreams," where one can stop the "What's better?" list after a while because "everything is better": the unconscious is already set in motion toward one's vision. Come to think of it, even your "Simplest Form of No-List" seems relevant here. Writing the next thing before doing it seems easier than asking yourself "What am I going to do next?"<br><br>Anyway, that's where I was going with speculating about an "endgame" for the question "What am I resisting not doing?" I was thinking about moving beyond the question. It's possible I got carried away with speculation. Or maybe you never intended the question to be a full "system" in itself; just something you ask yourself situationally. I don't know.<br><br>Sorry if any of my thoughts are half-baked. I share them only in case they spark your own thinking in some way. Best wishes.</div>

<div>I do see the examples about children but I still can't understand how it applies to a long list. If someone could give examples from their own list of how they asked the question and how they responded I might be able to understand it.</div>

<div>I have read all of the comments and the original post to the new question and I still cannot understand what the question means. If I give an example perhaps somebody can explain. For example I'm considering quitting a job. I list the pros and the cons of quitting the job. Then I list the pros and cons of not quitting the job but to me I would think of this in a positive way of staying on the job. So the question would mean am I resisting not quitting your job which seems to be the cons of not quitting. However to me that isn't the only consideration for the decision and I might make a bad decision if I only consider the cons of not quitting.  The cons might be interpersonal conflict and stress and not having one's talents used on the job.</div>

<div>Mark H:<br><br><< I still can't understand how it applies to a long list. >><br><br>Imagine that this is the beginning of a long list:<br><br>Email<br>Charge Phone<br>Tidy Desk<br>Write Meeting Minutes<br>etc.<br><br>When you ask the question "What am I resisting doing?", you are measuring the amount of resistance you feel towards doing each one of the items. <br><br>If you are like me, the answer would probably be "Write Meeting Minutes". It's much harder and more boring work than any of the others because it requires deciphering hastily written notes, and getting it all into a logical sequence, while paying attention to finicky details..<br><br>Now let's look what happens if you instead ask "What am I resisting not doing?"<br><br>The answer is probably going to be the same - "Write Meeting Minutes" - but the reasons are going to be entirely different. If you don't do the task now, it will hang over you all day, you may be late with it, you may have emergencies during the day which will prevent you getting done.You may have to rush it so you miss important points. And if you don't do it quickly it gives a bad impression.<br><br>So your motivation is entirely diffferent:<br><br>1) You don't want to do it because you are resisting the hard work involved.<br><br>2) You do want to do it because you are resisting having it hanging over you all day, with the danger you might not get it done in time, creating a bad impression.<br><br>"What am I resisting doing?" therefore concentrates on the negative consequences of doing it, i.e. Hard boring work.<br><br>"What am I resisting not doing?" concentrates on the positive consequences of doing it, i.e. Getting it out of the way as quickly as possible and creating a good impression.</div>
