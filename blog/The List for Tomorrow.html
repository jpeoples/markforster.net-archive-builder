<div>Ah, that's a relief, it's only one of those odd Briticisms.  :-) <br><br>I thought for a moment it was an attempt to break down your "take over the world" task into its component steps.</div>

<div>I'm curious, is this fairly much your entire AF list, or just a subset of it?<br>If that's only a subset, there's quite a lot on there...</div>

<div>ChrisKe:<br><br>This is my entire list. With this new version the tendency of the list to get longer and longer seems to have gone.</div>

<div>Goody: when are you coming to Reading? <br><br>Business or pleasure? (Though of course any opportnuity to visit this delightful market town can only be a pleasure...)<br><br>:o)</div>

<div>Do you have to put "wash up" on your list? I always wash up at the same time each day, and it's as much a habit as cleaning my teeth. <br><br>I'd love to see your reading list! Reading is my main hobby (calling?) and I'm trying to combine a reading list with my "to do" list.<br><br>I'm trying to seriously plan my serious reading. I'm doing this by re-reading Harold Bloom's "the Western Canon" to try to find find "the best", and plan to "read the best first!" Any thoughts on how to integrate such a (developing) reading list into your system?</div>

<div>Mal:<br><br><< Do you have to put "wash up" on your list? >><br><br>I don't have to, but I do. I have a rule that if there's more than three items to wash up when I get to the task, then I do it.<br><br>You can of course do it however you like.<br><br><< Any thoughts on how to integrate such a (developing) reading list into your system? >><br><br>The tasks "Reading List" refer to articles etc on line which I keep track of on a Firefox extension.<br><br>The task "Reading" refers to books. I have all my current books on a shelf, with the most recently read one on the left. When I come to this task, I look along the shelf from the left and pick the first book that stands out for me. I find that works better than putting the book titles themselves on the list.</div>

<div>Seraphim,<br><br>Actually, "guillotine" is what it is called here too.  At least I've always called it that.  However, there is a much nicer version ( but not as heavy duty) which utilizeses a sliding handle.  I like it better.  It is also less scary ;-)</div>

<div>Mal,<br><br>I've been working a combination of the Western Cannon, the Great Books of the Western world (nearly identical) and books from several other sources I got by web searching.  I'd love to know more of your experiences in this area.  Reading is also my passion.</div>

<div>Guilhotina is also the word we use in Portuguese (Brazil).</div>

<div>I can't recall if you've spoken about this sometime before. Do you also use a Planner or Calendar ONLY for appointments or things to be done at a specific day or hour? And, of course, use the AF4 for everything else? Thanks.</div>

<div>Nelda:<br>My system is more a case of appointments and reminders ONLY go into a diary/schedule (I'm using Office/Outlook 2010).<br><br>Of course, I may put a task into my DWM/AF list, 'Reminder: draft report ready by 31 July 2010', then use Outlook Task reminder to bring it up on a date before that.<br><br>I'm also setting aside some blocks of time in the schedule to focus on certain tasks or groups of tasks.<br><br>A recent addition to my system (DWM) is to create a Daily Closed List of tasks that I feel MUST be done on the day, work tasks list from the top down, personal tasks from the bottom up, both on the same page in a Moleskine pocket notebook.  Such target tasks are culled from my main DWM (or AF if you use that) list.<br><br>For the main DWM/AF list, I have moved since the very beginning of AF from A4 to A5, to Moleskine Large (about A5), and now to Moleskine pocket book; both the DWM and Daily Closed List notebooks are in my shirt pocket.</div>
