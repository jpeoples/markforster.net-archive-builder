<div>Can I add another one Mark?  I'm still struggling a little with the relationship between SF and projects.  I seem to remember (but I have a faulty memory!) that this was s subject you were going to write a blog about - you may have covered it off in a post and I missed it. However I know there has been a lot of discussion about this so it might be nice to consolidate all comment, or just right up your thoughts on this.  Many thanks for all your work on this.</div>

<div>Alison:<br><br>I suggest you follow my reports on how this project goes. It's a big project with lots of subprojects - it should cover most of the techniques.</div>

<div>Mark when you throw something huge like this in, will you keep a separate sublist for specifics on each of these tasks? <br><br>I'd imagine if you're flipping between doing these 16 projects, you may lose little ideas/notes/subtasks/etc without jotting such things down somewhere.</div>

<div>"7. Re-design website so it is SuperFocus focused"<br><br>Mark, it is your website of course, so do what you like.  But I would be remiss if I didn't say that I detest these one size fits all formulas.  You still have plenty of DIT and AF users out there.  My point is that I'd hate to see this become a forum solely focused on SF to the exclusion of your other great products and solutions.  SF is good, just not the best tool for my personal needs at the moment.</div>

<div>TK:<br><br>I'm not intending to remove support for the other systems. But at the moment a newcomer to the site is faced with a plethora of different systems with no real guidance or organisation to help them.</div>
