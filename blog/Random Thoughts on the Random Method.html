<h1>Random Thoughts on the Random Method</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2016-07-11 7:00</div>
<div class="content"><p>Since we have been discussing the Random Method of time management in yesterday’s post and its comments, I thought I’d say a little bit about it in today’s blog post.</p>
<p>First of all here’s the link to the <a href="../blog/Random Time Management.html">original post</a> about the method.</p>
<p>Re-reading it as I am now after an interval of two and a half years, here’s a few remarks about it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting the range of the Randomizer for the number of lines on the page is more important than I thought at the time. <br> 
<ul>
<li>If you set the Randomizer for a lower number you may not be able to jump the crossed out tasks on a page, which means you will be stuck on the page until every task has been done on it. </li>
<li>Setting the Randomizer for a higher number on the other hand means you may miss out a page altogether, which may upset the weighting towards earlier tasks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don’t let your list get too long. I recommend a maximum of the number of tasks you can work on during an average day. (Notice I say “work on”, not “do”). If you have more than that number the gap between writing a task on the list and working on it gets too long. </li>
<li>Remember that a random system is just that - random. It is not in any way taking your needs and priorities into account. There is no guarantee that any particular task will be worked on during a day, while some may be worked on several times.</li>
<li>For these reasons don’t use the system for very time-sensitive tasks. It is brilliant for despatching a lot of work in a very short time, but you can’t guarantee exactly how long that “short time” will be. Use a schedule instead for this type of task.</li>
<li>Remember the longer your list the longer the average time to reach any given task.</li>
<li>The list is weighted so that the longer a task has been on the list the more likely it is to get picked during a pass. Conversely the shorter the time a task has been on the list the less likely it is to get picked.</li>
<li>Don’t put tasks on the list that you aren’t fully committed to doing. If the system picks a task and you don’t do it, you are undermining the effectiveness of the system and you will start to experience procrastination with a vengeance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tomorrow I’m going to discuss some possible amendments to the system to make it even more effective.</p>
<ul>

<div>The scary bit is "two and a half years". If you had asked me to guess I would have said a year at most!</div>
