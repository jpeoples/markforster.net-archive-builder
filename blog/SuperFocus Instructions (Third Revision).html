<h1>SuperFocus Instructions (Third Revision)</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2011-02-7 14:20</div>
<div class="content"><p>As I have previously mentioned, I have been experimenting with some further changes to the SuperFocus  rules. These have been performing extremely well, so I am releasing them now. Please note these do make some considerable changes to the system as follows:</p>
<p>1) Unfinished tasks are now re-entered in Column 2 of the following page and not the same page.</p>
<p>2) Column 2 must always be cleared before moving on to the next page.</p>
<p>3) Once Column 2 of a page is filled, everything remaining on that page must be cleared the next time it is worked on.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE NEW RULES</strong>:</p>
<p><br><a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/autofocus-system/">Normal AF1 rules</a>, except:<br><br>1.  There is a second column (Column 2) on each page. This is used for  adding additional tasks to pages as follows:<br><br>  a. Re-entering unfinished tasks. These are entered in Column 2 of the <em>following</em> page. If you are currently on the last page, then the following page is the first active page of the list. <br><br>  b. Entering tasks which you want to do urgently. These are entered on the current page.<br><br>2. Column 2 is treated as a part of the page along with Column 1, with the difference that all tasks in Column 2<em> must</em> be actioned before moving on to the next page. No unactioned tasks may be left in Column 2.<br><br>3. Unfinished tasks are always re-entered in Column 2, even on the last page.<br><br>4. Once Column 2 is full, no further tasks may be entered on that page.</p>
<p>5. The <em>following</em> <em>page</em> for re-entry purposes means the next page which has any room left in Column 2. When you are currently on the last page, the <em>following page</em> is the first active page of the list. Similarly when entering urgent tasks, if column 2 of the <em>current</em> <em>page</em> is full the tasks are entered on the next page with room.</p>
<p>6. If no tasks are done in Column 1 during a visit to a page, all remaining tasks in Column 1 are dismissed. This rule does not apply to the last page of the list.</p>
<p>7. When you visit a page which is full (i.e. has no space left in Column 2), all tasks on that page must be actioned or dismissed.</p>
<p><strong>Signs and symbols</strong></p>
<p>a. When a task has been actioned, it is crossed out with a horizontal line.</p>
<p>b. When a task is dismissed it is highlighted.</p>
<p>c. When a dismissed task is reviewed and either reinstated or removed altogether, it is crossed out as it is no longer subject to review.</p>
<p>d. A page which has no active tasks left on it is marked with a cross in the outside upper corner.</p>
<p>e. When there are no active tasks left on any previous pages, the cross is surrounded with a circle.</p>
<p>f. When there are no dismissed tasks still subject to review on any previous pages, the circle is highlighted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>The aim of these rule changes is to increase the flow of the system by no longer re-entering unfinished tasks on the same page. At the same time additional pressure is brought to bear to keep working on unfinished tasks. Once a task has been entered in Column 2 it must remain in Column 2 on every page until it is finished.</p>
<p>The new rule about what happens when the page is full is intended to encourage sensible use of Column 2. It is vital to the whole procedure, that one is clear in one’s own mind when a task is finished, and this needs to be defined carefully.</p>
<p>I will be publishing consolidated rules for those not acquainted with previous versions shortly.</p>

<div>Thanks for the updated information. An observation and then some questions:<br><br>First, in your rules, you have no rule 3 and two rule 6. [Thanks, David, corrected! - mf]<br><br>When you say "When you visit a page which is full (i.e. has no space left in Column 2), all tasks on that page must be actioned or dismissed.", I see this as a fairly major change to AF1 rules which specify you must do something on at least one task on a page, even if it's full, in order to prevent the remaining tasks from being dismissed. It appears that now you must finish all tasks on a full page in order to prevent those tasks from being dismissed. Am I reading that correctly?</div>

<div>Mark - so if I understand this correctly, these revisions to SuperFocus dismisses reoccurring tasks until it is time to take action on them once again, correct? For example, if I have a weekly reoccurring task "clean bathroom", it would be actioned to completion, re-entered into the second column of the following page, and 'dismissed' when that second page was actioned.</div>

<div>"all tasks in Column 2 must be actioned before moving on to the next page. No unactioned tasks may be left in Column 2."<br><br>If I understand correctly, once you start something, you are not allowed to leave it behind, so every page you must work on it.  So if "Read War and Peace" is your written task, you must each SF page actually read some more War and Peace.  Is this correct?<br><br>Based on the above, I expect you actually enter  "Read one chapter" so you can occasionally escape the book.</div>

<div>Alan:<br><br><< If I understand correctly, once you start something, you are not allowed to leave it behind>><br><br>Yes, you understand this correctly. In the case of War and Peace I did treat it as one long task, so I've been reading some every page of the list. This was the only task I've treated this way, otherwise I'd have slowed progress on other things too much (and fallen very quickly foul of Rule 7).<br><br>You are also correct in saying that I could have phrased the task by chapter, or by number of pages read, or even "Read a bit of W&P". Careful definition of tasks is important.</div>

<div>+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>Thank you Mark for releasing SFv.3 early ^__^ I'm implementing it immediately.<br><br>Aside from the changing of the rules, I think what you posted last is a big change: "Careful definition of tasks is important."  <br><br>In the original AF1 instructions, you posted: "DO include plenty of creative tasks such as “Think about…”, “Investigate…”; “Discuss…”; “Review…”" By their nature, these action verbs are very vague.  So now in SFv.3 do you discourage these?<br><br>Also, if I understand your instructions correctly, now in even the last page Column 2 can and should be used? <br><br>God bless!</div>

<div>Hi,<br><br>I've been using SAF for a while now and really liking it. My only problem has that I did not get through the pages quickly as I was always adding unfinished (and important) work to column 2. The new rule of putting these tasks on column 2 of the following page should really make a difference!</div>

<div>This is nice! I've got a page staring at me, with a few tasks that I've put off for quite a while. And according to the rules, I can't turn the page! And by gum, I'm doing the tasks!<br><br>I know previous AF's have had some of this prodding built-in, but the "can't turn the page" rule really makes you work!</div>

<div>I've been away from the AF/SF scene for a while, but have been looking for this new revised system for a while. AF1 was good, and not too difficult to implement electronically (on my Android phone), but I'd love to hear some suggestions for implementing Superfocus on a smartphone. I'm specifically interested in the part concerning the second column. Otherwise I'd have to "experiment" with paper again ;)</div>

<div>Scenario: <br>On my last page (say page #12) I have column 1 not full.<br>I have column 2 full.<br>I need to reenter an unfinished task so I turn to the next page (page #13) and put it in column 2. <br>I think of a new task.<br>Do I put it in coulmn 1 of page #12 or page #13?</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Mark Forster - 2011-02-7 19:22</div>
<div>Ephi:<br><br>The answer is that if you've got column 2 full before column 1 is full, you have a serious problem.</div>

<div>Could you elaborate on Rule 6: "If no tasks are done in Column 1 during a visit to a page, all remaining tasks in Column 1 are dismissed."?<br><br>Does that mean if I complete all the tasks in column 2 of a page and not work on any from column one, I should dismiss the tasks in column one?</div>

<div>Ok, <br>I'm going to give this a whirl. I have a moleskine pocket notebook (24 lines/page)  <br>I'll use the facing page as "column 2"<br>All lines are currently full with tasks on my first page.</div>

<div>You said this was working very well for goals like fitness.  Do you treat "go for walk" as a recurrent task or a finished task when it's done?  (Meaning, if a 30 minute walk is "finished" for you, do you then enter it in the first column when you're done walking?)<br><br>Thank you so much for trying these systems out in your own life!</div>

<div>Hi Mark,<br>I am interested in how the testing process might have affected the outcome.<br><br>in the testing phase, did the fact that it was a test affect the rate at which you read War and Peace - did you read more at each sitting than you would otherwise have done, because you had made the success or failure of the whole process rest on your completing it, and declared that publicly in this forum?<br>For example you could read just one page of it for each notebook page, and take three years or so to complete it. <br><br>In general  I don't usually have external pressure for book reading and some other tasks, and these are the ones I struggle with. Or is it a case of once you get started doing it, you find you want to do it for longer anyway, and it completes therefore in a more reasonable time? I keep looking at that copy of Atlas Shrugged (645k words) that I was given as a ( tongue in cheek) Christmas present.. <br><br>Anyway thanks for publishing the details of  new programme, I'll definitely be trying it.</div>

<div>Mike C:<br><br>I'm sure the testing process did affect the result to some extent. On the other hand I don't think any other system would have worked so well - and some would have failed completely.</div>

<div class="comment-meta">FocusGuy. - 2011-02-8 4:07</div>
<div>I wonder, imagine you Have 2 pages. <br><br>Question about urgent and unfinished :<br>- I have a new urgent task even if i am on page 2 it goes on column 2 page 1 right ? <br><br>[No, urgent tasks go on the CURRENT page. If you are on page 2, it would therefore go in column 2 of page 2,  Though unless it is very urgent you would probably put it in column 1 as there is still space]<br><br>SO i do it but it is unfinished (ie finish doing something on project X) Then it goes on page 2 column 2 right ? <br><br>[No, unfinished tasks go on the FOLLOWING page. Page 1 is the following page of the last page, so if it's unfinished it will go in page 1, column 2.]<br><br>- Now if this unfinished task becomes again urgent, I understand it is crossed on page 2 column 2 and goes again on column 2 page one. This is what I would naturally do. Am I right ? OR do I have to let it on column 2 p2 as urgent but unfinished ? <br><br>[If it's become urgent again it will go in Column 2 of the CURRENT page, i.e. the page you are currently working on, whatever that is]<br><br>Thanks for this new system. I just finished to report my list and work an hour on it. I notice the system encourage dismissing things, working on urgent and do it but i dont see the effect about unfinished task which are most of the time important but not urgent. <br><br>[Make sure you are doing it properly. Your example leads me to believe you may not be. Make sure you read the rules again and are clear about the difference between the ways urgent and unfinished tasks are treated]<br><br>But what is urgent ? Some thing I must do in the day or the week ? If it is a real urgency then it must be done for yesterday (LOL) or the very soon as possible which would be for me within the 3 next days. ? Mark what is urgent for you ? <br><br>[Anything which I either can't or don't want to leave until it is reached in the normal course of working column 1]<br><br>Last question I love the parenthesis you use at the beginning of task to group task which are finished or reported. Do you still use this system ? I guess yes...<br><br>[Yes, it appeared in the picture I put of my SF notebook a few days ago.]</div>

<div>Jupiter:<br><br>"Now if this unfinished task becomes again urgent, I understand it is crossed on page 2 column 2 and goes again on column 2 page one. "<br><br>From my understanding of the rules, yes, anytime you feel a task is urgent, you can write it in column2 of the current page (I suppose crossing it out in column 2 of the next page is your choice, I would also do that).</div>

<div>Other question let say I am attending an answer of someone it must be followed ie i made a call or i sent a proposal does it go on the unfinished task ie in my previous exemple in page 2 column 2 as UNFINISHED ? or does it go on colum 1 where there is some place P1 or 2 ?</div>

<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">OhNiners - 2011-02-8 4:35</div>
<div>So basically Column 2's purpose is to address the 2 longstanding issues with AF1: <br><br>1. More emphasis on finishing tasks that need more than one pass to complete. <br>(Previously you would have to re-write your unfinished task all the way at the end and go through page after page to get to it. In my opinion this was the single flaw of AF1).<br><br>2. Allowance for urgent tasks. <br>(Though for me, the "common sense" rule was sufficient in AF1).<br><br>Awesome. These changes should indeed make AF1 "complete".</div>

<div>Lets say now I have 3 pages <br>Column 1 is full on page 1, and half full on page 2 (urgent)<br>Column 2 is half full on page 1 but full on page 2 (unfinished <br>then a new task happen it is again an unfinished does it go on page 3 column 2 as unfinished <br>A m I right ?</div>

<div>Until the process becomes a habit, this could be a list of the "must-do's" or best practices when visiting a page:<br><br>1. Must action all items in Column 2;<br>2. Must action at least one item in Column 1 or risk dismissal (except if you're on last page);<br>3. If column 2 is full, must action all or dismiss all items.</div>

<div>First, many thanks Mark for posting. <br><br>Probably still have a number of questions but one that i havent seen addressed yet is th treatment of 'waiting for' items. How do you deal with these? Presumably as a new item, rather than as an unfinished item?</div>

<div>Mark, thanks for the instructions - it's great to get them now instead of in a couple of weeks.  I started using the new system today, and immediately came up with a query.  However, reading through my post before submitting it, I started to see things in a different way, and realise that if I'd just followed the rules as you wrote them, the query wouldn't have arisen.   I decided I would post it anyway so that you can correct me if I'm wrong, and it may be helpful to someone else.<br><br>I think where I was going wrong was in thinking that I had to stay on the same page all day because it would take more or less all day to complete  the items in columnn 2.  I thought I had to stay on the same page till all the items in column 2 were COMPLETE, rather than until all the items in column 2 had been WORKED ON.<br><br>I now realise that if I follow the rules I SHOULD cross off the task I've worked on and if it's unfinished, re-enter it in column 2 of the following page, then work on the next task that stands out, and if it's still unfinished, re-enter it on colunn 2 of the following page.  Then when all of the items in the current column 2 have been re-entered or completed, and nothing else on the page stands out, move to the next page, where all my urgent unfinished tasks will be waiting faithfully for me in column 2, and get to work on that.  It means I'll probably whizz through all 9 pages of my list quite quickly (I'm using the list I had previously rather than starting a new list today).<br><br><br>HERE IS THE ORIGINAL POST I DRAFTED:<br>I have 6 items in column 2 of the page I'm processing.  They are not urgent in the sense that they need to be done right this minute, but they all need to be completed by the end of the day.  <br><br>My Column 2 is as follows:<br><br>Post query to MF website       (that's what I'm doing now!)<br>Write cheque for window-cleaner<br>Write and post letter to C<br>Preps for appointment tomorrow<br>House ready for guests<br>Shop and cook for guests<br><br>The first three items are things that I will be able to bring to completion in one go. <br>The last three items each consist of about 10 individual  tasks, and for each one I am keeping a separate list outside SuperFocus - if I didn't my column 2 would be filled up with all these individual tasks on one visit to the page. <br><br> When I work on these multi-step items, it won't be possible (or sensible) to  bring any ot them to completion in one go, because some of the individual tasks within them are time-sensitive.  As I work through the page, when I come to one of the multi-step items and it stands out, I intend to spend about half-an-hour on it (or as long as I feel like), then move on to the next item that stands out, and spend half-an-hour on that (or if it's one of the short items, do it to completion), and so on.   So I will be rotating through the items in column 1 and column 2  in this way until all the column 2 items are complete, and nothing in column 1 stands out, and I then move on to the next active page.<br><br>My query is this: after I've worked for 'as long as I wish' on one of the items that consists of multiple tasks, and knowing that it's still not finished to completion, should I cross out the item and re-enter it at the end of my current column 2 on this page?  I feel that this would result in running out of space in column 2.  The other option would be to do the crossing out of the item only once it was completely finished.   However, if I followed the rules, I would have to re-enter the unfinished tasks on colunn 2 of the following page, and wouldn't be 'allowed' to go there till I'd completed all the tasks on the current column 2.  <br>END OF ORIGINAL POST<br><br>Mark, thanks for your patience - I'm sure you'll need plenty of that in the next few weeks, answering all our queries.<br><br>P.S.  I've spent about an hour on this post that could no doubt have been better spent on actually working my SuperFocus list, whereas if I'd just followed the rules, I'd have made some progress on my urgent tasks - a valuable lesson for me!  Happy days!<br><br>Best wishes.</div>

<div>I think i got it for urgent tasks but there is still a point which is not clear for me about the unfinished task. May be the translation I do about it. <br><br>Well I have 2 pages. I am now working on page number 2. <br>I have an unfinished task. I now I have to report it on the following page. <br>For me the following will be page number one (if it is free) So it goes on page 1 column 1 unless it is urgent and will stay on column 2 page 2<br><br>So now lets do the contrary <br>If I am on page number one something is unfinished then it goes on column 2 page 2 unless it is urgent and it will go on columN 2 page one. <br><br>Please can you confirm this ? It is driving me nut ! <br><br>Thank you.</div>

Then I would have moved them a few at a time (starting with the most urgent) into col 2 of whatever page I was currently on. The advantages of doing it that way are:<br><br>- don't take up so much of col 2 on one page.<br>- can move more rapidly through the list<br>- can pick my order to work on the tasks instead of having to be working on all of them<br>- don't have to use subsidiary lists<br>- may get to some of the tasks in the normal way of working</div>

<div>Hi Mark - I'm pleased to report I'm almost finished all 6 items I'd listed, having used the method you suggested.  I spent most of the afternoon on page 1, actioning column 2 and then adding items that felt ready to be done into column 2 from the end of the list.  Nothing from column 1 on page 1 stood out because I wanted to work on items pulled into column 2 from the end of the list.  <br><br>The end of the list (although it's not the end now because quite a few items have been added) still contains things that have to be done today, but can't be done yet (e.g. because a phonecall has to be made at a specific time).   When they are available to be done, I'll move them to column 2 of whichever page I'm on, but in the meantime I'll carry on to the next active page.<br><br>I'm really enjoying the excitement of trying a new system.</div>

<div>I think I may be a bit unclear on what constitutes a "finished" or "unfinished" task. For a large task like "Create my website" in column 2, the task is finished and re-entered in column 1 of the last page when I've completed all the work I want to do today. If I work on it for a few minutes but don't get as much done as I want to for today, then it goes in column 2 of the next page. Is my understanding correct? <br><br>Second question: what if an old page has a column 2 that's full of crossed-out tasks from things that had been urgent on previous days. When I get to that page, does column 2 count as "full" for purposes of rules 4 and 7? Or does the definition of "Full" mean that column 2 is completely taken up with things that are urgent that I've added today?</div>

It's also up to you to be clear in your own mind before you begin, what "finished" means for that particular task.

It forces one to finish what one has started, and allows one to get on with stuff that needs doing now - but at the same time it prevents these things blocking all the other tasks that need doing.</div>

<div>Just a feet back Superfocus is incredible. There are some rules I dont still understand and I am not at all easy at all with them. I notice that the others are not easy themselves with them too ! LOL. So for theses I feel exactly like in the London smog. <br><br>My real problem is about the different option about unfinished task. But for the moment the balance beetween urgent tasks and normal tasks works indeed well with me.<br>because the rest is clear for me I mean URGENT TASK for example. <br><br>I am impatient about the video the one of Mark of course but also if you do one Erick may be you could do it in French I will post it  on my blog. And also about a real summury about the real rules of Superfocus V3 grouping the rules of AF1, SF2 and the  specific characteristics of SF3<br><br>For my own culture i would be interested to understand why Mark you decided a specific treatment of the unfinished task with differents options depending on beeing or not on the last active page.</div>

That means, the following page of 3 is page 1.<br><br>Now you have the rule to put an unfinished task in the second column of the following page. That means: if you are on page 1, put it on column2 of page 2, if you are on page 2, put it on c2 of p3, and if you on page 3, put it in c2 of p1. <br><br>Wolfgang</div>

My action list will say the name of the project and the page number...and the notes page will have the detailed task list.  This is helpful when you have bigger projects that include multiple tasks that are currently active.<br><br>The same holds for your agendas issue.  I have a notes page for each of my employees.  It lists their projects (upcoming, active, complete) and any items I want to discuss with them the next time we speak.  You could do this as well.  Refer to the notes pages when you meet with the person.  If you need to actively seek out a meeting, add it to your SF list.  My groceries list is similar.  I write items on a separate list as they come up, but I only enter BUY GROCERIES when that is ready to be actioned.  At the store, I reference the separate list.</div>

<div>Alain:<br><br><< In my job, i have very often to deal with an interlocutor at phone and thus, i have to speak with him or to action all the tasks and projects related to him.>><br><br>The way I would handle this myself would be to look through my list and then write all the points I wished to talk to him about on a separate sheet of paper. Once the call was ended, I'd cross of the list any tasks which had been completed. Tasks which still needed some action I'd leave where they were.</div>

<div>ah ! it's much better. Now I understand unfinished and urgent. Many thanks indeed Wowi and Mark/<br><br>@Alain  "deal with interlocutors" I do the same that mark. I have 3 or 4 people I speak 3 times a day with. I just a a separate sheet for them and collect everything on it. It let me un forget all I have to speak with them.</div>

<div>As promised here is my return about superfocus 3<br><br>Even If I still struggle a bit with the rules the systems is indeed incredible with me. <br><br>Advantage<br>- Excellent feeling of control. I believe in the sytem. It came naturaly with me as AF1 and AF4. <br>- Excellent intuition because of the system. I felt yesterday night I had to to make a call at 10 PM. The decision was right. It saved a crucial business situation. I understand why. Because, I felts confident with the system and peacefull, my brain made the right decision at the right time (even it was late).<br>- Addiction with the system YES ! I  like it so much like AF1. It is the same addiction. <br>- Good progressing with the unfinished task (Thanks you so much again for the explanation of UBI and MF ie "An unfinished task is always re-entered on the following page. As Wowi says, if you have three pages 1-2-3 and you are circulating round the pages in the normal SF/AF manner, the page following 3 is 1" It is simple now It is simple a cycle 123, 312, 231 ..." <br>- Excellent control about the urgent tasks the rule seems simple. Urgent goes on column 2 of the page I am working on am i right ? And urgent is something i must not quit until having done it exept if it is too long too do and i am fed up to do it.... Is it ok ? <br>- For me i use a little paper pocket note book 110 cm - 170 cm it is perfect  32/33 ligned tasks per page so i love it and I can have it everywhere with me. I hope i wont loose it. <br><br>Inconvenient<br>- Lot of difficulties of applying the rules. I had many difficulties with the unfinished. <br>- Dismissing is hard with me. Some tasks little by little are crossed but not highlined for the moment. But I never really understand dismissing. I hope there will be some explanation about this cause it is not still clear with me. <br>- It took me 2 days to be operational. I finally rewrite my last list because I prefered to go on a clean list. <br>- Some difficulties with the new tasks I still wonder when i think about an urgent task where do i put it ? I apology this point has bee stipulated somewhere.... But where ? <br>- Now inconvenient for the moment. Still AF1, then AF4 no system gave me more pleasure than this and i am so please to deal with a new system. <br><br>Statistic 33 tasks per column<br>3 actives pages<br>P1 C1 (full) 33 tasks (16 crossed) - C2 24 tasks (19 crossed)<br>P2 C1 (full) 32 tasks (17 crossed) C2 16 tasks (5 crossed) <br>P3 C1 (2/3 full) 23 tasks (3 crossed) C2 2 tasks <br>Free of back logs yes but i cheated i rewrite the list<br>Dissmissed tasks none P 1 there are 4 tasks lefts on 24 tasks...<br>Ready for dissmissing p1 C1 ? May be see that soon !!!!<br><br>Oh I love it !</div>

<div>I tried various forms of Autofocus previously but it never quite did what I needed my system to do. I thought I'd share my initial impressions from a few days use.<br><br>I just started with SF3 and found myself happily building my list and saying to myself "oh, that is urgent" and "oh that is urgent too". By the end of the day yesterday, I suddenly found myself with 5 pages of tasks and way too many Urgent things in column 2 on page 1. A sinking feeling came over me as I realized those things I considered Urgent were actually several days worth of work and I would never get off of page 1.  I also realized that I had tremendous resistance to some of the things Iisted in col 2.<br><br>I thought to myself that this couldn't possibly be what Mark intended, I must have missed something.  I thought about just crossing things off the list and moving them back to the end of the list as I couldn't cope with that much "Urgent" stuff, but realized that if I was going to do that I might as well not use the system at all. I would feel it was ok to "cheat" and as sneaky as as my mind can be about procrastination, I couldn't give in so easily.<br><br>So I went back and looked at column 2 on page 1 and tried to figure out how I could both  honor the sense of urgency that compelled me to put the thing in column 2 and overcome the resistance to some of the items listed. In the end it was  as simple as following the rules as written. Rule 2 to the rescue.<br><br>Actioning the task in this case was clarifying the urgency and ensuring I had properly identified an action to work on rather than just chucking a big hairy project onto the list. Once I completed this I was able to treat some items as unfinished and move them to the next page's col 2. Others felt complete once I did the thinking and spawned clearer, more detailed actions that could be added to the end of the list in Col 1 on my last page. At the end only a brief list of actionable tasks remained in Col 2 and were quickly dispatched.<br><br>Problem solved, no mental gymnastics or "tweaks" required.  The forcing functions of  completing Col 2 and working  on or dismissing items on full pages seems to be extraordinarily effective.  The things going onto the list are a lot crisper. If something ambiguous gets on the list, eventually you have to deal with it and that forces one to engage with the things one might otherwise avoid in other systems.  <br><br>Simple, and elegant, well done Mark!  Thank you very much!</div>

<div>Hi Mark,<br><br>I got 2 questions:<br>1. Sometimes an urgent task in column 2 may become not urgent. How to deal with this situation?<br>2. Sometimes some tasks in column 1 become useless. But if it's not the time according to your instructions to dismiss them because I just finished one task in column 1, may I dismiss them anyway? Or should I wait to the step 6?<br><br>Thanks,<br>Box</div>

<div>Box:<br><br><< 1. Sometimes an urgent task in column 2 may become not urgent. How to deal with this situation? >><br><br>This shouldn't happen too often as since the idea behind putting the task in Column 2 is that you will do it quickly - so it shouldn't have much time to become non-urgent in! But if for example your boss says "I don't need that report now until the end of next week", you can just cross out the task and re-enter it at the end of the list.<br><br><< 2. Sometimes some tasks in column 1 become useless. But if it's not the time according to your instructions to dismiss them because I just finished one task in column 1, may I dismiss them anyway? Or should I wait to the step 6? >><br><br>You can delete any task at any time if you decide you are not going to do it at all. This is not the same as dismissing a task, because a dismissed task is still up for review.</div>

<div>Mark,<br><br>You wrote in response to Ephi:<br><br>>The answer is that if you've got column 2 full before column 1 is full, you have a serious problem.<<br><br>That isn't a very helpful answer. Could you elaborate?<br><br>I've read your instructions and I'm trying to envision whether or not to try it. I see two problems – one of which is the same problem that Ephi mentioned.<br><br>My first problem is that it involves a LOT of rewriting. That's going to be a burden for me to overcome.<br><br>Secondly, I have many urgent tasks and many unfinished tasks because of my liberal use of the little-and-often principle. My re-entered unfinished tasks outpace my entry of new tasks. And, when you add in the rewriting of already entered tasks that have now become urgent, then that is a lot of column 2 tasks.<br><br>So, knowing that to be true, I have the same concern as Ephi. I can envision the processing reaching the point he mentioned. Could you please address this concern?<br><br>Thanks.<br><br>Matt</div>

If it does the system will only work for you if you adjust the number of unfinished and urgent tasks. You would have to adjust the number a lot, because to work the system properly you should be able to visit a page four or five times before Column 2 is full.<br><br>You can adjust the number of unfinished tasks by defining many of your tasks so that they can be finished in one go. <br><br>You can adjust the number of urgent tasks by redefining what you mean by urgent, i.e. instead of "a task I must do today" to "a task I must do in the next hour". <br><br>If you are not willing or able to do this, then SuperFocus is not for you.</div>

<div>Thanks, Mark.<br><br>> It doesn't involve any more rewriting than any other version of DIT/AF/DWM etc.<<br><br>I respectfully submit that it does, though perhaps not by much. Tasks already existing in the list have to be rewritten into column 2 when they become urgent. This is a new feature not found in other AFs.<br><br>I actually think this version is very clever. It really appears you have plugged a lot of the holes of your other AF versions. I commend you on it.<br><br>I think my multitude of self-directed work projects will prevent me from using this method, unless I separate out my project tasks and just identify the project name as a task. I can foresee a couple of problems with that, but I will defer mention of them until I try it. I think I will finish my experiment on my latest revision of AF1 that doesn't have any rewriting first. <br><br>Anyway, thanks for the answer.<br><br>Matt</div>

<div>Hi,<br><br>I am french and this is my 1st post.<br>I tried AF1, AF2, DWM, SAF and finally chose AF1.<br><br>I have been testing SF3 on both personal and professional lists for 3 days.<br>Flow is good, SF3 seems really promising and I have a question for you.<br><br>This afternoon I was working on my current page (as there was still unactionned items in column 2) but I had to action 7 urgent items in the following page. Thus I broke one rule. It is allowed?</div>

<div>Mark,<br><br>You made this comment back in February that confused me a bit:<br>"But the way I actually dealt with my walking goal of at least three times a week was not to re-enter it at all, but to put it directly into Column 2 on those days on which I intended to take a walk. That way it had to get done! "<br><br>Did you mean that you would put it in pages ahead?  This would imply that pages correlated to calendar days, which I hadn't seen mentioned in any of the "Focus" styled systems.  DIT or DWM, yes but AFx or SF, no.<br><br>-OR- did you simply mean that on the day you intend to walk, you put that task in column 2 of whatever your current page happens to be...  I think this is what you must have meant.<br><br>I have a strong affinity to your systems that include a time factor - what can get done in a day.  Then my "to-do" list (or in DIT "will do" list) is also a sort of journal of "did-do"'s... This is useful in a review when I would ask myself a question like: "So what’s been better since we spoke yesterday?" ;)<br><br>Anyway, I was hoping you'd clear up that ambiguity about your daily walk entries and if you have any advice about 'dealing with the day', I'd be interested in hearing it.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Michael</div>
