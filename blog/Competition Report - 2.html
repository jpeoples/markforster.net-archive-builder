<h1>Competition Report - 2</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2011-03-21 16:45</div>
<div class="content"><p>Since there have been no more serious entries yesterday or today I will bring <a href="../blog/Time for another Competition.html">this competion</a> to an end at midnight (UK time) tomorrow. That still gives plenty of time for people to write a winning contribution.</p>
<p>I’ve been rather surprised at the low number of entries because this is a subject which has been discussed frequently and at length on the Discussion Forum. Reasons given for not writing entries have varied from the question being too hard to the question being too easy!</p>
<p>Just to stress the point again which I have made before. The question is not about producing a guide for aspiring historical novelists. It is about how to control a multi-faceted personal project (and by “personal” I mean only one person’s activities require to be co-ordinated).</p>
