<h1>The Invisible Clock</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2008-10-2 16:17</div>
<div class="content"><p>I am often asked to recommend a timer which can be used silently in a busy office. A reader has drawn my attention to the <a href="http://www.thebluesun.co.uk/acatalog/invisible.html">Invisible Clock </a>which has multiple alarms and a timer. It can be set to audible or vibrate and can be worn hooked on a belt.</p><p>I haven’t tried it out myself, so if anyone buys it and tries it out do please let us know how you get on with it.</p><p><em>Related article:</em></p><p><a href="../blog/My Favourite Time Management Tool.html">My Favourite Time Management Tool</a><br></p></div>

<div>Mark, I'm a big fan of the Time Timer (<a href="http://www.timetimer.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.timetimer.com</a> ). It shows a visual representation of time and has audible, inaudible and computer versions. I've found it very helpful.</div>

<div>Mark, <br><br>I ended up buying, Polder Digital Timer, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Polder-Digital-Vibrating-Audible-Illuminated/dp/B0002EXVIM/ref=pd_ecc_rvi_cart_1." rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Polder-Digital-Vibrating-Audible-Illuminated/dp/B0002EXVIM/ref=pd_ecc_rvi_cart_1.</a><br><br>It can be muted as well supports both up and down counting. <br><br>I have heard the invisible alarm does not keep time well. Kind of an anti-reason to buy a timer which can't keep time. What gives. <br><br>Let's see how this experiment works out. <br><br>Cheers,<br>Ra</div>

<div>And I've bought a TimeTimer. Just the thing for timing sessions in seminars and things like that.</div>

<div>I once bought the Invisible Timer for my work.  The vibrating function was so insanely loud it could clearly be heard throughout the room.  So I returned it.  Lately I've been using a meditation timer on an old palm pilot I had lying around.</div>

<div>Hi,<br><br>I've had an Invisible Clock for over a year. It works a treat. The instructions are fairly obtuse and could do w/ being clearer.<br><br>It's pretty darned feature-rich which is how I like most gadgets yet is still pretty useable - even despite the instructions.<br><br>The clock on it is normally a minute or so out but that is no problem.<br><br>I have no hesitation recommending it - I have bought a second one in fact.<br><br>@Lena: The Volume can be turned down - the settings are from 1-3. There's also vibrate.</div>

<div>I tried an invisible clock but my feet stuck out from underneath it. <br><br>I shall be sticking to my invisibility cloak from now on - it might be old but it's still reliable!</div>

<div>You might also Google the Pacesetter which can be worn on a belt for presentations and has vibe and audible warnings, including 2 pre-alarms (you can set it off x & y minutes/seconds before time is up)<br><br>Bob</div>

<div>Thanks for the tip, Bob. <br><br>The Pacesetter can be found at <a href="http://www.goleapfrog.com/home.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.goleapfrog.com/home.cfm</a><br><br>The fact that the website announces "Hopefully, sometime in 2004 we will introduce the Pacesetter Ultra (version 5.0) and two other unique timers" might suggest that the Pacesetter hasn't solved all the production team's time management problems!</div>
