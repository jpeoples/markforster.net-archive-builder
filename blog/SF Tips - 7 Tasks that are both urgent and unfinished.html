<h1>SF Tips - #7: Tasks that are both urgent and unfinished</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2011-03-23 16:38</div>
<div class="content"><p>A task that is both urgent and unfinished will normally have started life as an urgent task, though it is possible that an unfinished task may become urgent during its lifetime.</p>
<p>Two examples of urgent and unfinished tasks are:</p>
<ol>
<li>an urgent task that wasn’t finished the first time it was worked on</li>
<li>a larger task deliberately selected for regular treatment</li>
</ol>
<p>Writing this tip is an example of the first. I decided it was urgent because I wanted it done sooner than I would reach it in the normal course of things. I knew I needed to do a first draft before finalising it, so allowed time for two sessions of writing it.</p>
<p>Reading “War and Peace” was an example of the second. In order to get the book read quickly I decided it was “urgent” to get moving on it, and kept it in column 2. This meant I was reading it multiple times a day.</p>
<p>This provides a flexible way to do important projects while at the same time dealing with more trivial but necessary tasks.</p>
<p>To repeat what I said in my last two tips, it’s import to keep the tasks in Column 2 to a minimum. In particular it would be unwise to keep more than one, or possibly two, long term projects in Column 2 at a time.</p>
<p><em>Next tip: Dismissal</em></p></div>

<div>"In particular it would be unwise to keep more than one, or possibly two, long term projects in Column 2 at a time."<br><br>Yes, this sounds to me a very good advice. I'll implement it.</div>

<div>Mark,<br><br>Isn't ANY started but unfinished task treated the same as an urgent task (unfinished or not), and differently from unstarted tasks?<br><br>It didn't occur to me quite so clearly until I wrote it down, but that feels to me like a key driving principle, differentiating .SF from DIT, AF and DWM.</div>

<div>Hi Mark, <br><br>Thanks for these great tips; they are very helpful. A quick edit: you forgot to tag this entry with the SF tips tag.</div>

<div>This article was alright, but I'm hoping the one on Dismissal wasn't dismissed.</div>

<div>Hi Mark,<br>just for clarifcation: After one reading session, where exactly did you put "War and Peace": C2 on the SAME page or C2 on the NEXT page?<br><br>Since you considered it to be urgent, according to the rules it would have gone on the same page, right?<br><br>btw: Thanks for all you great tips. Yesterday I have started implementing SF and I am curious how it'll work out. Thanks for sharing your insights!</div>

<div>BG:<br><br>It started by being entered on the same page as "Urgent", but when the reading session was over it went on the next page as "Unfinished".</div>
