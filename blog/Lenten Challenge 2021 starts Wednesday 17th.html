<h1>Lenten Challenge 2021 starts Wednesday 17th</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2021-02-9 9:31</div>
<div class="content"><p>This year’s Lenten Challenge will start tomorrow week on <strong>Wednesday 17th February</strong> (Ash Wednesday). </p>
<p>I’ve decided to keep the usual form this year, rather than the different one in my post of 27 January.</p>
<p>The idea is to keep to the same time management system for the whole of Lent, which <strong>ends on the evening of Thursday 1st April</strong>.</p>
<p>You can use any time management system - it does not have to be one of mine. </p>
<p>Please book in in the Comments to this post, stating which system you are going to be using. If it doesn’t have a name you should briefly describe it.</p>
<p>If you fail to keep to the system, then please report in the Comments that you have withdrawn from the Challenge. You can also report progress in the Comments and of course celebrate your win if you complete the Challenge!</p>

<div>Tried a lot of your systems but never managed to keep to any one for 30 days (or anywhere near it!). I think the change in systems generates novelty that resets your enthusiasm  even if you have used it before.However I am using 5T well at the moment in 20 to 25 minute rotations and adding 3 new tasks when I get down to 2 so that's what I will use during the challenge</div>

<div>5T with timebusts. Similar to Skeg, but start at 5 minutes, per item, increase by 5 until 25 minutes, then back down to 5... Refresh list when only 2 remain.</div>

<div>I'll try Mark's not published new system without even knowing it.<br><br>I 've been admiring his practical and inventive thinking for over ten years now, so there is a good reason for trusting, that - while being maybe not the best fit for me - it will be at least a worthwhile experience to try it thoroughly and to the letter.<br><br>This feels like an adventure. Can't wait to read the description!</div>

<div>Laby:<br><br>Not quite that fantastic! <br><br>The blog editor dates a post from when I start writing it rather than when I finish writing it. I can change it manually, but usually forget.<br><br>The actual time from my above comment to publishing the post was about 30 minutes.</div>

<div>Okay, I've been thinking about GITKIR, and I think I'm willing to give it a try for Lent. :-) I'm interested to see whether it can address some of the traditional issues that I have with long lists.</div>

<div>Aaron Hsu:<br><br>I'll be interested to see how you get on with it. As general advice I am finding that it's important to get my routines established first, which then gives me a firm foundation for the rest of my work.</div>

<div>Just enjoyed reading Make your Dreams come true, and have found it really helpful over the past few days, so I will try that.</div>

<div>I'm going name my commitment to be what I'm calling Serial Two List.  My actual objective is a bit more encompassing than might be described as a list processing system.  The list will be the scaffolding of each day, which build on some foundational habits.</div>

<div>Can I change my system slightly? Rather than 5 tasks in 25 minute burst and replenish when down to two, I intend to put all may work into 5 areas, Routine, Carbon, NRC, Reports and Plans (makes sense to me) and rotate through them as per Get Everything Done (the Book that gave this website its name!)</div>

<div>I'll use my own system, actually a combination of 3<br><br>1. WeekMap (map (not route) each week, look at it each day with pen in hand)<br>2. Semi-weekly Journal (15 minutes before meditation)<br>3. Often ask a) Is there anything that absolutely needs to be done now? b) What are some very useful things I'm willing and able to do right now?<br><br>That's it. Everything else can (and will) change. I *expect* a mix of AF1, random, FV, and 5/2. Lots of preparation / opening the folder rather than tackling big projects, but that's not part of the system.</div>
