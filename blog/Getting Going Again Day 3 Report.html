<h1>Getting Going Again: Day 3 Report</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2008-02-22 15:44</div>
<div class="content"><p>Today I finished my work by 3.45 p.m. which was just as well as I have an engagement at 4.30 which will take out the rest of the day. So far I have succeeded in sorting out quite a number of outstanding matters and, as you will have seen, getting the blog going again. I have a far greater sense of being in control, but there are still many things which need sorting out - especially the state of my office! That will be my next Current Initiative once I have cleared my backlog of paper, which should only take a day or two more.</p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0340909129?tag=markforstthet-21&camp=1406&creative=6394&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=0340909129&adid=04WWDDGHJG5BEQBRWM66&" target="_blank"><span class="sizeLess20"><u><font style="color: #800080" color="#800080">Buy Do It Tomorrow</font></u></span></a></p></div>

<div>Hey Mark,<br><br>Are you going to discuss in further detail your experiments into a different more intuitive time management system and what you have learned?  Actually my opinion is that your DIT is about as simple as it gets though...<br><br>Andy</div>

<div>Hi Mark<br>Today I finished my work by 3.45 p.m. which was just as well as I have an engagement at 4.30 ......<br>As Lou Armstrong said (paraphrased)...<br>Don't just tell me what to do.....Give me a deadline!<br><br>When my house is messy, I invite guests!  When I don't want to do something, I promise it at a specific time to someone I respect......<br><br>It's so exciting to read your journey and notice the parallels with my own work habits and attitudes....<br>This is truly inspiring stuff!  Thank you for allowing us to be voyeurs!  LOL!<br>vickie</div>

<div>Hi, Andy<br><br>Now why would you want to know about methods that don't work? The nearest I got to success was using the technique I described in yesterday's post "Structure v. No Structure", but even that needed to be used as part of a structure, not on its own.</div>
