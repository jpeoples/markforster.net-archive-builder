<h1>Great FireWall of China</h1>

<div class="content"><p>I see that according to the website <a href="https://www.comparitech.com/privacy-security-tools/blockedinchina/" target="_blank">http://greatfirewallofchina.org/ </a>my website is blocked in China. I can’t imagine why that would be. If anyone in China can actually read this, perhaps you would let me know!</p></div>

<div>Good link. I am banned too. I thought it was for my subversive ideas, but maybe they don't like people to get organised. Seems they don't mind the population indulging in prOn though, I tried entering an adult site, which was not banned.</div>

<div>I am apparently banned as well, but I note that the website says that the sensational information may not be all that it seems. In fact, it may be meaningless, which is obviously a different kettle of fish.</div>

<div>Although the amazon.co.uk home page is not blocked, the page on which my book Do It Tomorrow appears is!<br><br>Obviously highly subversive of something or other.</div>

<div>I'm reading this at my office in Shanghai. I can also view Wikipedia from here (though it has been blocked before).<br><br>My experience is that the consumer access is much more heavily firewalled than the business access.</div>

<div>Sorry, that should read "that consumer access is more heavily firewalled than business access" -- omit the "the's".</div>
