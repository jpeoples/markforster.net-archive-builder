<div class="content"><p>After five days without internet, I am now back on-line. I hope there will be no further interruptions to the service.</p>
<p>I have now processed all outstanding requests for accounts for the Discussion Forum. If anyone has applied for an account and it is not yet working, please contact me again with the registration details.</p>
<p>I’ve also approved all non-spam comments on the blog. If anyone has made a non-spam comment which has not yet appeared, please re-post it.</p></div>

<div>I read the other post where you mentioned about getting spam. Instead of having to spend time moderating comments, is it easy enough to implement a Captcha onto the site? This way there'll be almost no spam with no additional moderation time required.</div>
