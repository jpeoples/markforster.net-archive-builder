<h1>Dieting at Christmas - Part II</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2006-12-26 11:47</div>
<div class="content"><p>I managed to reach Christmas Day with no rules in place which meant that I was free to gorge myself as much as I pleased, which I took full advantage of. The result of all this was that I was 4 lbs over the day's target weight when I weighed in this morning. </p><p>There's another family lunch coming up today. The only rule in force at the moment is "No Second Helpings", so it's a fairly good bet that I will still be several pounds over the target tomorrow.</p><p>This is all fine. The rules will kick in progressively until I am back on target. The only question is just how many rules will come into force before that happens. If this diet can survive Christmas, it can survive anything!</p><p><em>Full details of the diet I am following can be found </em><a href="/blog/2006/12/4/can-i-improve-on-the-no-s-diet.html"><font style="color: #0072bc" color="#0072bc"><em>here.</em></font></a></p></div>
