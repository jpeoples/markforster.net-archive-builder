<h1>New Look</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2007-01-12 10:43</div>
<div class="content"><p>I have been worried for a while that the website is looking rather cluttered, so I decided to take advantage of a new template from <a href="http://www.squarespace.com/?associateTag=markforster" target="_blank">Squarespace</a>. I think the new look is much cleaner and easier to follow, but would appreciate your reactions in the Comments.</p><p>The great advantage of using a template is that it only takes about four mouse clicks to change it back again!</p></div>

<div>Dear Mark<br>Thank you for the opportunity for feedback. Personally i think that the background is too fussy and makes the sight cluttered. I liked it as it was.<br>Deb</div>

<div>I can barely read the text now with that background!  Please can we return to plain white (or at least have the option to choose between style sheets)?<br><br>Emily</div>

<div>Lose the floral background. Makes reading difficult.</div>

<div>I don't like the floral background either, but I do find it easier to read - probably because the page isn't so dark.  Not sure...</div>

<div>Hello Mark, I much preferred the colours/font/feel of the original theme... the new navigation seems more straight foreward but I was actually never confuesed by the old one. best, michele</div>

<div>Hi Mark<br> The 'work friendly icon no longer works if you just hover over it, You now have to click to make it change.<br><br>D</div>

<div>Hi, Debbie. It's not the Work Friendly icon that works by hovering over it. It's the Boss Key on the text only window.<br><br>Click on the Work Friendly icon, then the text only window should open. Look up in the top left hand corner and you will see a highlighted box named "Boss Key". Hover over it and the text will disappear. The "Boss Key" itself changes into a "Read" key. If you hover over that again, the text will reappear.</div>

<div>Like others here, preferred the old template.  It was lean and clean.  The new one is cluttered, like the pattern of a well worn pub carpet.</div>

<div>the coffee and cream/paisley style is too wishy washy and promotes a feeling of 'commitment avoidence'<br><br>If you drive a porshe, be bold. Roger.</div>

<div>There is something here I like (the tone) but I prefer the old one. I just think the colours of the previous template could be different,</div>

<div>Am I the only reader who like the new look? I liked the old one too, but this is easier on the eyes and less business-like. The wallpaper is friendly and welcoming, like a granny's front room, (although neither of my grannies would have had grubby wallpaper!)</div>
