<h1>Deletion of Unused Discussion Forum Accounts</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2011-06-8 16:54</div>
<div class="content"><p>The Discussion Forum is now approaching the limit of 250 Members Accounts which Squarespace allows without my having to pay a whole lot extra.</p>
<p>There are a number of accounts which have been set up but never used. I propose to delete these early next week. The accounts at risk of deletion are:</p>
<p>AndrewW</p>
<p>Balfour</p>
<p>Bobbullets</p>
<p>Djorn</p>
<p>Firstday</p>
<p>Geoff C</p>
<p>Kase</p>
<p>Larry G</p>
<p>leeyho</p>
<p>Marshall</p>
<p>ms</p>
<p>Owen</p>
<p>Peter Kraan</p>
<p>Phelim</p>
<p>Rebecca</p>
<p>smeatho</p>
<p>Stan</p>
<p>Vivavita</p>
<p>If you want to avoid your account being deleted all you have to do is log in. You do not have to make a post. Once your account has been deleted you can re-instate it at any time by emailing me with the details.</p>
<p>After I have taken up the extra places freed by deleting these accounts, I will make room for new accounts by deleting existing accounts in reverse order of when they were last logged-in.</p></div>

<div>And how do you like SquareSpace as a webhost?</div>

<div>Andy:<br><br>Well, if you want a cheap/free blog for your own leisure purposes then you'd be better off with Blogger or the like. But if you need a large number of web pages, discussion forums, and loads of other facilities I would say it was pretty good, though there are some irritating features.<br><br>It's also very customizable and good for pictures. Since mine is a mainly text-based blog I don't use most of those facilities.</div>
