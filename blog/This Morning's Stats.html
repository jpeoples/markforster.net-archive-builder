<h1>This Morning's Stats</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2021-04-12 12:16</div>
<div class="content"><p>I started a new list today for <a href="../blog/A Simple New System to Try Out.html">A Simple New System to Try Out</a> as described in my previous post.</p>
<p>This is the situation as at midday:</p>
<p>0-1: 6 tasks, all done.</p>
<p>1-2: 12 tasks, 11 done, 1 remaining</p>
<p>2-3: 9 tasks, 8 done, 1 remaining</p>
<p>3-4: 7 tasks, 5 done, 2 remaining</p>
<p>5-6: 17 tasks, 11 done, 6 remaining</p>
<p>6-7: 23 tasks, 2 done, 21 remaining</p>
<p>7- ; 1 task</p>
<p>Total Tasks: 75</p>
<p>Done: 43</p>
<p>Remaining: 32</p>
<p>(The numbers (0-1 etc) refer to the lines drawn across the list each time you go back to the beginning. Only the last one (7 in this case) still plays any part in working the system.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>By 7 p.m. the totals were:</em></p>
<p>Total tasks: 122</p>
<p>Done: 80</p>
<p>Remaining: 42</p>

<div>Scott:<br><br>I don't have any experience with ADHD, so can't answer that I'm afraid. But I have been told by some teachers of children with ADHD that they get on well with the main system in the book "Get Everything Done And Still Have Time to Play".</div>
