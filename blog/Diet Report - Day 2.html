<h1>Diet Report - Day 2</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2006-12-5 10:13</div>
<div class="content"><p>In spite of the <a href="/blog/2006/12/4/can-i-improve-on-the-no-s-diet.html">choccy cake </a>(yes, it really did exist), I found I had lost a pound when I weighed myself this morning. That's half a pound under my target weight for the day. So I still have no rules. This afternoon we will be going up to London to see the Velasquez exhibition at the National Gallery. Trips like that always involve eating out, so it will be interesting to see how well my (so far) ruleless diet survives.</p></div>

<div>What is your problem Mark? You look gorgeous! (NB: I'm NOT adding "for a man your age".)<br><br>Your diet segment of the blog makes me smile - strongly reminds me of Bridget Jones ... <br><br>"Had choccy cake yesterday and felt instant guilt pangs. Will that cute Asian minx ticket sales girl at the Velazquez exhibition notice the bulge around my mid-section? Well, hope she doesn't recognise me! <br><br>Feel like Michelin Man and decided to share the burden on my blog lest I nervously light another Marlboro Light. <br><br>Two hundred and thirty-eight grams under target weight. This would make me skip through the house normally, but the choccy cake has derailed me. I now feel as if I could crack the wooden floor if I skipped.<br><br>Will I ever look like Pete Doherty? I'm starting to despise myself for my weakness but I'm also starting to fret about the further course of my diet, and since I can't do two things at the same time I had to prioritise. Thank God for time management! ... '<br><br></div>

<div>Thanks, Heike. You seem to have read my mind very well. When the Hollywood movie version comes out, who do you see as playing me?</div>
