<h1>Obligation a Cause of Procrastination</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2008-10-14 8:57</div>
<div class="content"><p>There’s an interesting article on the <a href="http://wonderwomen.typepad.com/my_weblog/2008/10/freedom-from-procrastination.html?cid=134647017#comments" target="_blank">Wonder Women</a> blog about a sense of obligation being one of the main causes of procrastination.</p><blockquote>When I was in sixth grade, I took piano lessons. Each week, I would
meet with my piano teacher and tried to fake my way through the
assigned pieces that I had not practiced. I hated that I had to play
certain songs for a certain period of time, even though I enjoyed the
piano. Finally, I convinced my mom to let me quit. From that day on, I
sat and played piano for about an hour a day.</blockquote></div>

<div>This is so true!<br>For example, I love studying and very curious about everything, so I can sit down and read with no problem any subject. But once that subject becomes an obligation (like an homework or a test),  I automatically start procrastinating and avoiding everything related to that subject. I think this irrational and paradoxical attitude is because I feel that now I have to be perfect in that subject and I'm terrified of having a bad note. The problem is that I'm not learning anymore for love of knowledge and curiosity but to proof that I'm good cause I have the obligation to be good.<br><br><br>P.S.: I found your Blog through LiteMind and you have very interesting articles, that I hope will help cause my procrastination is really giving me serious problems at college, and I sometimes feel so unproductive that I even thought in quitting ("if it's not perfectly done, It's not worthy doing it"). <br><br>But I intend to change those negative thoughts so I'll keep reading your posts Mark  :) Thank you very much!<br><br><br>Laura, from Mexico</div>
