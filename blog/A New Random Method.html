<h1>A New Random Method</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2021-08-24 8:40</div>
<div class="content"><p>One of the favourite systems on this blog is the <a href="../blog/Random Time Management.html">Random Method </a>which is noted for the way in which it removes resistance to your tasks.</p>
<p>The reason for this reduction of resistance is something which I first experienced in the Army - that it’s much easier to obey orders than to give orders. In other words stress comes from responsibility rather than from the work itself.</p>
<p>Using a random time management system is a bit like deciding what you want to do and then constructing a robot which tells you exactly how to do it, step by step. Easy, huh?</p>
<p>Not so easy.</p>
<p>The bad news about random numbers is precisely the fact that they are random - which means that they are completely indifferent to your wishes, goals, time constraints, and energy levels. The good news is that they are also indifferent to your fears, laziness, resistance, procrastination and wishful thinking.</p>
<p>If you were just to have a long list and circulate around it using a random number generator to select which task to do next, you would have no control at all over what order you do your work. Some unimportant projects would get done in record time, and some really important ones would languish for ages.</p>
<p>Maybe that doesn’t sound much different from your normal work pattern?</p>
<p>So how can we use random numbers to produce better rather than worse results than normal?</p>
<p>Well, here’s a way. It’s slightly more difficult to use than the existing Random Method because you have to keep adjusting the Max setting on the random number generator. But I’ve found the results to be much better.</p>
<p>1. Write out your task list (you can keep adding to it).</p>
<p>2. Set the Max on your random number generator to the number of tasks on the list.</p>
<p>3. Generate a number.</p>
<p>4. Count through the list until you reach that number task and work on it. Delete and re-enter as necessary.</p>
<p>5. Your list is now divided into two unequal halves with the deleted task as the dividing line. Repeat the process using the first half only, and then the second half.</p>
<p>6. Carry on sub-dividing the list in this way.</p>
<p>Some of you may think this is <a href="../blog/Another Simple and Effective Method.html">Another Simple and Effective Method</a> used with a random number generator. You’re right - it is. So far I’ve found it fast and efficient, and actually much more so than when the method is used with only my brain in charge. Bear in mind though that I’m only on Day 3 of testing, and new systems always work well to start off with.</p>
<p>P.S. I recommend you to use the Randomizer app as your random number generator. I’ve been using it for years for all sorts of purposes and it’s really excellent.</p></div>

<div>I've used this method since you introduced it, probably 2014.<br>And still using random.org for all these years to generate random number sequences.<br><br>It works great - whether paper-based or Onenote based. <br><br>Thank you for new insights.<br><br>Generally, your books and your blog have greatly influenced my life.<br>Even my Onenote journal is called "DIT" :)</div>

<div>Thank you, Slawek. I hope my ideas continue to work for you.</div>

<div>I'm seeing a pattern here!<br><br>Combination of old techniques instead of inventing new ones.<br><br>I think there's a great merit in that one could offset the shortcomings of another one.<br><br>For example, I'm exploring using ABC listing with mind mapping. <br><br>Similarly would be happy to see what methods could be combined here.<br><br>Idea sex?<br><br>Would love to see your take on this angle, Mark</div>

<div>Sathya:<br><br>You might try this little exercise.<br><br>Write a numbered list of your favourite time management methods.<br><br>Use the Randomizer to select two from the list.<br><br>Now try to find a way to combine them to provide a better method.</div>

<div>You can tilt the probability of randomly selecting more important tasks by assigning a score to each activity, and then using that score to create an interval range.<br><br>     So for example, I have to work on task A, task B and task C. On a scale of 1 (least important) to 5 (most important), maybe task A is a 5 task B is a 3 and task C is a 2. <br><br>     The sum of the 3 scores is 10. So I generate a random number between 1 and 10. If it falls between 1 and 5, I work on task A. If it falls between 6 and 8 I work on task B. If it falls between 9 and 10 I work on task C. <br><br>    You can pick a random number between 1 and 10 in Excel with the function =RANDBETWEEN(1, 10)<br><br>     The problem is that not everyone wants to fiddle around with Excel. Not sure how to set this up on paper. Possibly you could rewrite the same task on several rows, or maybe even leave a few blank rows below more important tasks. Then if the random number generator lands on a blank row, you work on whatever task is above the blank row(s). This would increase the probability of landing on key tasks. <br><br>     This approach still preserves the benefits of randomness while tilting the outcome toward more important activities.</div>

<div>Simon: <br><br>Sorry, I missed your post when it first appeared.<br><br>One problem with giving priority to some tasks is that it reduces the priority of everything else. So, yes, you would be increasing the likelihood that the important tasks get done within a certain time period, but at the same time you would be decreasing the likelihood of unimportant tasks getting done within the same period. So how you define "important" becomes crucial. <br><br>There's also a second priority to consider which is urgency. So establishing the correct priority is not just a matter of importance.<br><br>The way given in the rules is probably in the end at least as effective and a good deal easier, i.e. don't let your list get too long, keep all tasks at equal priority, and use the rule "If something needs doing now, do it now."<br><br>And if you still want to give some tasks extra priority, then a much easier way than fiddling with priorities in Excel is just to put the same task in twice.</div>
