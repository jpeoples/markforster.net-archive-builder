<div class="content"><p>What do you do when the inevitable happens and all your systems for time management collapse?</p><p>Typically this happens when you get an unexpectedly high work load, or you go away for a period and fail to get going again on return. Or perhaps your computer crashes and it takes three days to fix - and everything else gets thrown out of the window. Or perhaps you’ve just goofed off for a day or two and are now experiencing the knock-on effects.<br></p><p>Under all this pressure, you tell yourself that you’ve got too much of a crisis to be systematic. In fact you may well tell yourself “I can’t get the system going again now - I’ll wait until things settle down a bit”.</p><p>This is of course exactly the wrong approach. When things are really tough is the precisely the time that you most need to be systematic. When you find yourself in a crisis, you need to tighten up on the system not let go of it. Because it will be the system that enables you to get through the crisis in good shape. </p><p>Remember: <strong>When the going is difficult is when you need your system the most.</strong> </p><p>It can however be very hard to get the system going again because often people don’t know where to start.</p><p>With the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0340909129?&camp=2486&creative=8886&linkCode=wey&tag=markforstthet-21" target="_blank">Do It Tomorrow</a> system it’s easy - provided that you focus on the right place. And that is to get your Will Do list ready for the following day, or if possible even for the current day.</p><p>Everything else can be dealt with by making a Backlog of it. Make the Backlog the first item on the Will Do list and you are on top of your work again.<br></p><p>So, to sum up, when things get out of hand don’t try to struggle on and catch up. Declare a backlog, and focus on getting your Will Do list going again.</p><p><em>Related articles:</em></p><p><a href="/blog/2008/2/20/getting-going-again.html">Getting Going Again </a></p><p><a href="/forum/post/372735#post372940">Backlog of Backlogs </a></p><p> </p></div>
