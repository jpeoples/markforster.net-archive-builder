<div>Mark I am quickly becoming a big fan of FV.   I am curious about one thing.  I don't see any comments or reviews of using Culture Codes Things application.   I now have incorporated the FV thought process while using this application and it works as well if not better than anything else that I have seen suggested.   Also you can easily manage projects in the application with the FV methodology.    Have you looked at this?   If not, will you and give me your opinion?<br><br>Thanks</div>

<div>Hi, I hope you are well Mark.  I miss your comments  and want you to be healthy and continuing your creative work.  <br><br>  I just re-studied Final Version and have decided to give it a go.  I am seriously unmotivated and depressed, looking around at many unfinished projects and tasks and have been very discouraged.  I will let you know what happens.  Thank you.</div>

<div>Hi Ruth.  Mark has been mostly absent from the forums for a while, but occasionally puts a word in.  Mainly, he is retired and enjoying that, but keeping busy with other things besides the forums.  We all hope he's preparing something wonderful for this site but it's his retirement.<br><br>But there is an active forum here.  Click on FV-forum above and share your questions, needs, difficulties and lots of people will help.  And if you want to discuss things besides FV, the general forum has friendly participants too.</div>
