<div>Questions;<br><br>In the email prior the system release there was an instruction to also buy a smaller notebook.  It wasn't mentioned in the instructions.  Was it deleted or is this the home notebook?<br><br>Also, as the day progresses for an office worker do you add things like return phone calls to the last page of the list individually or treat them as a separate list with the add being return phone calls?<br><br>I need to sit down tonight and create the first list.<br><br>Thanks<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div>Gerry:<br><br>What the email said was:<br><br>"A notebook with ruled lines (at least 20 lines to the page). I use an A4 book with 34 lines (Letter size is the nearest American equivalent) for office work and a smaller A5 book with 31 lines when travelling. If you want to use the system for more than one location (Workplace, Home, etc.) then I recommend a book for each location."<br><br>Re phone calls: whichever works best for you.</div>

<div>Hi Mark, you may recall from a previous post that I had only recently discovered DIT and was finding that helpful, I have a busy job (reactive environment), home, community commitments and want to start up a new business. I started back at work after 2 weeks off yesterday and worked through emails most of the day jotting tasks down as I went for those requiring more than a very quick response and filed items away confident in the knowledge that I had a single record of actions, so empty In-Box! Today I am working my way through the list 32 items long, which would normally fill me with dread but is actually feeling enjoyable, will report back on what I achieve.<br><br>Will tonight produce my Home list in sep book as recommended, I really like the separation aspect that provides between work and personal.</div>

<div>Cleared 14 items plus a few "extras" which crept in through calls and email. Cleared all the incoming email, feel calm and in control - first time for a long time with Work. Definitely focused on what needed to be done, no missed deadlines, and what I did felt to be the right things. Looking forward to applying to Home now!</div>

<div>I started on the first day and had a full page list almost immediately (my large book is home and my small book is work) i now have only 14 items left on first page and have filled half of second which also has a few items crossed out. I keep adding clear email and thencrossing out, as with walk dogs which is a resistance item. My question is: how do we address what used to be current Initiative? On my first page are ;start assignment' and take x exam but these are long standing resistance items and i have not actioned anything on either of them? Thanks Katie</div>
