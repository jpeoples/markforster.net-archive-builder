<h1>Speed Update: Day 1</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2011-09-24 23:50</div>
<div class="content"><p>Today I managed to do 61 tasks off my new list, with 39 remaining in the list.</p>
<p>The number of days work left on the list is therefore 0.64.</p>
<p>The oldest unactioned task on the list dates from today (which is hardly surprising as the list was only started today).</p>
<p>One of the tasks I accomplished today was a walk of over 15 miles, which took me away from 11.50 a.m. to 7 p.m. as it required some travelling to get to the start.</p></div>

<div>You beat me by about 40, and also by 13 miles.</div>

<div>To get this clear: you stared with 100 tasks (61+39), you completed 61 of them and you are left with 39 for the next day. That's a lot! I could never do that many tasks in a day, because on average a task takes 30 minutes. Mark, yours seem to be only 5 minutes or less. What kind of work do you do?</div>

<div>zokiboy:<br><br>No, I didn't start with 100 tasks. I actually started with 12, this being a new list which I was starting from scratch. The others were added during the day as I thought of them or as they came up. Quite a few were re-entries.<br><br>You can't compare the number of tasks I did with the number of tasks you are likely to do because my list includes both work and personal things and I use the list for everything - from the time I get up to the time I go to bed. I also use the "little and often" technique, so I might break a 30 minute task into three ten-minute segments, each of which would count as a task in my statistics. On the other hand the 7 hours 10 minutes I spent on "Go for a Walk" only counted as one task.<br><br>The really significant figures are not the total number of tasks but:<br><br>1) The number of days work left on the list.<br><br>2) The oldest unactioned task on the list.</div>

<div>"I might break a 30 minute task into three ten-minute segments, each of which would count as a task in my statistics."<br>This changes my understanding of your count entirely.</div>

<div>Alan..  What?! You knew this all along.  You've been on this site for a long time.</div>

<div>I know how Mark operates, and I do similarly.  But when counting tasks, I don't count the same task multiple times.</div>
