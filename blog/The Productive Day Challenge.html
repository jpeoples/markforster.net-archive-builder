<h1>The Productive Day Challenge</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2015-06-7 23:30</div>
<div class="content"><p>What I am going to do is define what I would need to have done in order to consider tomorrow (Monday) to be a productive day. I will be using <a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2015/5/21/the-final-version-perfected-fvp.html">FVP</a> as my time management system.</p>
<p>I am going to use my list as it is - which has most of the tasks on it already. I’m not going to cheat by moving them all to the end of the list.</p>
<p>I’ll report back on how many of the tasks I succeed in doing.</p>
<p><em>So here goes - I would consider tomorrow to be a productive day if:</em></p>

<div>This astounds me in the number and size of tasks you're taking on. (I would set aside a day for "Sorting out contract for phone" alone!)<br><br>I feel incredibly unproductive compared with the people who post here - which is why I tend to keep my head down and almost never post about my own experience ("the forum wants to hear from the productive people - not from the likes of me"). <br><br>Doubtless if I accounted for my own activity in a better way, things wouldn't seem quite so bad.</div>

<div>Just wondering, Mark. Do you think of 'Dishes' as a kind of Inbox? Or is that just an accident of where Dishes is placed on your list above?</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Laurent - 2015-06-8 11:54</div>
<div>@Neil : Dishes are things to do that come in continually, like paperwork and e-mail. The inbox metaphor makes sense.</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Mark Forster - 2015-06-8 11:55</div>
<div>Neil Cumming:<br><br>"Zero inbox" applies to everything that fills up during the day and needs keeping on top of. That definitely applies to doing the dishes! And "Comments" too.<br><br>I struck the five "inboxes" out as soon as I cleared them. If they're not still clear at the end of the day, I'll remove the strike-out.</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Will - 2015-06-8 14:51</div>
<div>Mark,<br><br>1. The thing that strikes me is the contrast between this approach and the "pick 3 things to achieve today" approach. I'm now not sure whether the latter approach is ridiculously slack, or whether it is aiming at a different type of goal.  <br><br>2. "I struck the five "inboxes" out as soon as I cleared them. If they're not still clear at the end of the day, I'll remove the strike-out."<br><br>Is there a particular reason for doing this rather than rewriting (on the assumption that more will arise) and then dealing with them at the time? Or rewriting when more arise?<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Will</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Neil Cumming - 2015-06-8 14:53</div>
<div>Yes, that makes sense. <br><br>Mark, do you find that listing in advance the tasks you want to do today in order to make it a productive day has helped you focus while working the list?</div>

<div class="comment-meta">ubi - 2015-06-8 18:36</div>
<div>I too was astounded at the size and scope of this list, all to be done within a single day.  I just estimated the time I think it would take me to do all of these (without adding any time for breaks or all the other incidental daily activities), and it totals 12 hours 45 minutes.  And Mark is supposed to be retired!</div>
</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Will - 2015-06-8 18:46</div>
<div>Thanks, Mark.<br><br>"I think you're misunderstanding ..." not for the first time! :0(<br><br>How's the list of metrics for tomorrow building up? If I got that much done in a day, I'd be quite pleased with myself. Perhaps I'm simply not trying hard enough on the average day.</div>

<div>This kind of posts are fascinating. I remember a few years back someone created a pdf (Andreas?) that illustrated an entire day using AF4(?). Would be great to see this with FVP.</div>

<div>Outstanding - Congratulations, Mark!<br>I'd be interested to know how your motivation and energy levels held up, but I think you deserve a good night's rest before you answer any more questions...!</div>

<div>Neil Cumming:<br><br><< I'd be interested to know how your motivation and energy levels held up,>><br><br>Absolutely fine. As I said somewhere it's really just a normal day's work for me.<br><br>More tomorrow.</div>
