<div class="content"><p>Tomorrow’s article will be called <em>No-List and Autofocus</em>.</p>
<p>Today I’m starting a test on an experimental task system which, as the title suggests, is a combination of No-List and Autofocus.</p>
<p>I will be describing it fully tomorrow for the benefit of anyone who wants to try it out at the same time as me.</p></div>

<div>Looking forward to it, though as I mentioned in another post, I seem to be doing a version of no list + Super Focus.</div>

<div>I will look forward to trying it out! I've been trying 5t for a while, but I just can't seem to get it to work for me. At the same time, I understand completely the shortcoming of the catch all list - they seem to eventually lead to the same resistance that I feel with 5t. <br>What has been working beautifully for me is the random list - it's a catch all list to be sure, but not with the intention of completing anything on it. It's just all "there." There is no motivation to complete the list. When I have a few moments (or hours) of discretionary time, and I have completed work that comes in as it comes in (that's my priority), then I just work the list randomly. It is so liberating not to know, or care, what I do next, while it is amazing actually how much gets done. (I'm following the rules set up in the random system described by Mark).</div>
