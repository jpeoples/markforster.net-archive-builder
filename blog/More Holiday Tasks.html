<div>I rather think that Mark enjoys these activities. Speaking as one who also works for oneself it is easy for ones work to become a hobby as well.  I love tinkering with my website (I'm just building a new one for a niche service).</div>

<div>You misread him, nuntym.  He said he would release instructions now in order to take a longer time to write a quality book.</div>

<div>Mark,<br><br>For your book, I think readers new to your philosophy would be interested in 'boxes' showing actual improvements and suggestions from the community over the more than three years the forums (fora, forae?) have been active.  This could reinforce the practical side of all the testing that has been done over the years.<br><br>I'm thinking of people like Alan Baljeu (no offence intended towards the other 'stars') whose comments are nearly always pertinent..<br><br>This could show how FV has evolved in real life, rather than in academia or similar.<br><br>Just a thought.</div>
