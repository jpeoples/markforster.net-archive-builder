<div>Hmm. Will we be able to tweak the ebook with our own customizations to fit our life-or-death unique situations that the vanilla ebook can't satisfy? :-)<br><br>Sold.</div>

<div>In case people don't know (which I didn't) e-books CAN be read on a PC. No need for a kindle device, just install the software<br><br><a href="http://ow.ly/pM9DN" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://ow.ly/pM9DN</a></div>

<div>Christine:<br><br>Is that midnight UK time? The publisher is in San Francisco, and the time there currently is 7.52 a.m. on a Monday morning!</div>

<div>michael<br><br>Most ebooks can be read on most platforms. As well as desktop, Kindle has apps for iPhone and Android. Most of the time I prefer reading my Kindle-format books on my Samsung to reading them on my Kindle, though it wins when I need the longer battery life (a week plus v. about five hours!) or greater readability outdoors.</div>

<div>Only a few more hours left for Monday, London time. Are there "glitches" affecting the rollout? (Haven't checked US or UK Amazon site yet. . .)</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Mark Forster - 2013-10-14 19:12</div>
<div>ubi:<br><br>It's an American publisher in San Francisco, so the book will be published in their time not mine. At the precise time of writing the time in SF is 10.12 a.m.</div>

<div>Thanks, Mark.  I actually live in the SF Bay Area. Are you going to stay up all night for the announcement? :-)</div>

<div>ubi,<br><br>Not a chance!<br><br>I've heard nothing from the publisher though I've emailed them to find out what is going on.<br><br>Even if it gets published, you'll need a code to get the discount and I haven't had that yet either.</div>
