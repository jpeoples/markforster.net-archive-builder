<div class="content"><p>BryanR of our discussion forum has put an interesting article on his blog <a href="http://coyotewatches.wordpress.com/2011/02/19/">Coyote Watches</a> about his experiences with AutoFocus and SuperFocus and how they have helped him with the effects of Post Concussive Syndrome.</p>

<p>What the system allows you to do is keep a list of activities that you  roll through every day.  Most to-do lists are open ended, you just keep  adding to the end of the list and you tend to forget about the  beginning.  His system is a closed list that loops around on itself  which causes older tasks to become relevant again.  This is perfect for  my memory issues.</p>
