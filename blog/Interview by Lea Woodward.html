<div class="content"><p><span class="full-image-float-left"><img style="width: 110px; height: 145px" alt="41265cb7dfd27d28-bb9f.png" src="/storage/41265cb7dfd27d28-bb9f.png"></span>There’s an audio file of a 35 minute interview with me by Lea Woodward on her website <a href="http://www.leawoodward.com/2007/03/interview_with_.html" target="_blank">“Success Rocks”. </a>The audio quality isn’t very high unfortunately but as result the file is quite small and downloads quickly.</p><p>In the interview I answer the following questions:</p><p>1. What do you do as a “Time Freedom” coach? And how did you get into this?</p><p>2. Do you agree that the very successful people in the world base their lives around activity/productivity rather than time?</p><p>3. Do you think we should all get rid of watches/clocks?</p><p>4. Would you suggest that placing a value on things that have to be done… not as in prioritizing but attaching a value to a task might give you more reason to complete it? And how would you suggest going about that? </p><p>5. With regards to your weight loss approach – what aspects of your approach do you think others in the same situation (e.g. weight loss or other health goal) would find useful?</p><p>6. What are your top 3 tips for somebody who struggles to complete tasks due to “poor time management”?</p></div>
