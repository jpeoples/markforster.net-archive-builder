<h1>How right do you think you are?</h1>

<div class="content"><p>It’s not often that we get the chance to see quite as clearly as we do in this video how pundits and experts can be completely and totally wrong. But if the people ridiculing and condescending to Peter Schiff in this video are deceiving themselves, how sure can we be that <em>our</em> most cherished convictions are correct?</p>

<div>Fascinating video - interesting how the critics of Peter Schiff didn't even seem to want to understand what he was trying to say.</div>

<div>If there's one thing I've learned to be certain about in life it's that you can never be certain about anything!!</div>

<div>Except of course for taxes and death.  And with genetics and biochem advancing so rapidly - that might only leave taxes.   ;-)</div>

<div>Here's a link to Peter Schiff's website:  <a href="http://www.europac.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.europac.net/</a>    Lots of great articles.</div>

<div>What I like is how he never seemed to get frustrated or angry when dealing with people who were laughing at him and dismissing his theories publically without fairly considering them. Good temperament!</div>

<div>Touche. Well selected example. So awfully well in line with your I'm 90% sure... post. This should be a good reminder to all - but I'm not so sure it is to many (e.g. people on the video -- and the alike -- being so strongly "90(/99)% sure").<br><br>Found your books & website yesterday. Very intriguing. <br>... And while I clearly understand that you'd very well like to sell all your books to everyone it would be nice to hear your thoughts on whether it makes sense to read all of them or just e.g. DIT over GED? (Ref. e.g. Guy Kawasaki who has commented that those who haven't yet read his Art of Start should only read his newest, Reality Check). <br><br>Comments here or anywhere are most welcome. From anyone, of course.</div>
