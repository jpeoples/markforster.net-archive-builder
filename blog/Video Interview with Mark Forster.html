<h1>Video Interview with Mark Forster</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2010-02-1 12:39</div>
<div class="content"><p>Here is video from December 2008 of me being interviewed by Amanda Malloy of <a href="http://www.videofocus.co.uk/index.html">Videofocus</a>. It’s mainly in a “Do It Tomorrow” context, but contains many good points and is in my humble opinion well worth seeing. It lasts just over 30 minutes.</p>

<div>Interesting interview indeed. I like the fact that it goes beyond the "simple" time management aspects.</div>

<div>Really interesting to hear how it all came about & how you set up your business.  Inspiring to hear how you developed your business & how to keep going when you felt like giving up.  Sections on thinking & focus very important, good reminders to not get 'caught in the moment.'  Thank you for a great video.</div>

<div>Hi there, Videofocus doesn't seem to be active online and this video link doesn't play anymore. Any chance you could re-upload or (even better) add an Interviews section to the site? <br>I have heard some good podcast interviews with you online elsewhere and would be good to have them all in one place. Efficient systems and all that'... :)<br><br>All the best!</div>

<div>Hunter G:<br><br>I don't have a copy of the interview unfortunately so can't put it up. Although it says that it's available on blip.com I've searched the site without result. If you can find it, I'll put it up!</div>
