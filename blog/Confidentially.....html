<h1>Confidentially....</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2006-12-22 17:41</div>
<div class="content"><p>Sometimes it’s the little things which annoy one most. For me one is those confidentiality clauses which are often appended to the end of emails. If they want something to be confidential, why are they sending it by email for goodness sake? Email is about as confidential as sending it by postcard.</p><p>Anyway a prize example is the weekly email I get from our local cinema telling me about the forthcoming attractions. Our cinema is run by the local council so every one of these emails ends with the following message:</p><blockquote><p><span style="font-size: 8.2pt; font-family: 'ms sans serif'">This e-mail message neither creates nor is intended to create a contract between Horsham District Council and the addressee or the addressee’s organisation. It is confidential to the Council and the addressee. If you receive this e-mail in error, please destroy it and delete it from your machine.</span></p></blockquote><p>So I’m going to break confidentiality and tell you a secret:</p><blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 11pt; font-family: verdana">Casino Royale is coming back to The Capitol in January.</span></p></blockquote>What are those sirens I hear in the distance?</div>
