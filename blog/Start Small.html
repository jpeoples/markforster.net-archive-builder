<h1>Start Small</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2006-10-9 15:53</div>
<div class="content"><font face="Verdana" size="2">One of the most difficult coaching situations I come across is people who can't make up their mind about what they want to do. This very often happens when they want to start a new business but can't decide what it should be. So they are full of ideas but never get down to making any of them work. Very often they decide that they can't start their business until they have got more training or have finished some lengthy training that they are taking part in at the moment. </font><p>The secret of course of getting any small business under way is to start it. If you are planning to set up some huge project for a large business then you need to plan it in the greatest detail. But the great advantage of starting your own small business is that you can start small and adjust as you go along. Everything you do is a learning experience and you will quickly learn what is best for you. </p><p>You can use the financial methods I have been talking about in the last few issues to get yourself moving. Instead of concentrating on the question of what you are going to do, instead concentrate on starting to earn money. Start with a really small goal like earning £100 and set out to earn £100 through your own business. See how long it takes to earn your first £100 and then see how long it takes to earn your next £100. You will begin to learn what you can offer that will bring money in. You will learn what works and what doesn't work. Before long you will be making your goal into earning £1,000 and so on. </p><p>You will still need to make decisions, but the decisions will no longer be a way of putting action off. They will be decisions that are made as part of an ongoing business. </p></div>
