<div>This is a top ten list I sometimes use which focuses on techniques. <br><br>1. Don’t prioritise (i.e. decide which activities you are going to well and which you are going to do badly) — instead select which activities you are going to do properly and get rid of the rest.<br><br>2. Whenever you find yourself using words like “always” and “never” in connection with a problem (“The data sheets always go missing”, “I never seem to be able to remember the action I agree to take at meetings”, etc. etc.) there is something wrong with the system. Take the time to think through the system so you can put it right for good!<br><br>3. Remember Parkinson’s law - work expands to fill the time available for its completion. If you have too much to do, shorten your working hours. It sounds weird but it works!<br><br>4. Always cost meetings - and only hold/attend ones that provide more value than they cost.<br><br>5. You work more efficiently with definite scheduled cut-off points, e.g. breaks, end of work, timed bursts.<br><br>6. Always clear your in-tray (paper and email) completely every day - or, if you prefer, several times a day. If you have allowed a backlog to build up, ring- fence it and deal with it as a separate project.<br><br>7. Don’t just work <em>at</em> your job. Work <em>on</em> it as well. You should aim to spend at least 20% of your time planning, thinking and strategizing.<br><br>8. Schedule your leisure at least as hard as you schedule your work.<br><br>9. Never put off starting work on a major project because the deadline seems a long way off — little and often is the rule.<br><br>10. Remember every time you take on something new, you have to stop doing something old. </div><br>
