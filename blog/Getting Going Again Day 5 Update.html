<h1>Getting Going Again: Day 5 Update</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2008-02-25 8:44</div>
<div class="content"><p>Yesterday was Sunday, so I did no work at all and only switched my computer on in order to watch a downloaded TV programme. So no Will Do list - no Task Diary - though a few ideas did occur to me during the day which I added to the Task Diary for tomorrow. Having somewhere to stash ideas meant that I wasn’t tempted to do some work on them since I knew that I would be able to deal with them on Monday. So today (Monday) I have two days worth of email, paper and voicemail to deal with. That shouldn’t be any problem as long as I get on with it.</p><p>Although I gave myself a rest from the DIT system on Sunday, I went through the day using the method for preventing resistance which I described a couple of days ago in my posting <a href="/blog/2008/2/22/structure-v-no-structure.html">Structure v. No Structure</a>. It worked extremely well.</p><p>The one thing I would really like to achieve today is to get to the end of my paper backlog. So I am going to concentrate on getting that finished, even if it means that I don’t get through everything else.</p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0340909129?tag=markforstthet-21&camp=1406&creative=6394&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=0340909129&adid=04WWDDGHJG5BEQBRWM66&" target="_blank"><span class="sizeLess20"><u><font style="color: #800080" color="#800080">Buy Do It Tomorrow</font></u></span></a></p></div>
