<h1>Only Five Days to Start of Challenge!</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2019-03-1 12:45</div>
<div class="content"><p>Just to remind you that the <a href="../blog/Lenten Challenge 2019 - for your diary.html">Lenten Challenge</a> starts on Wednesday next week. So if you haven’t already signed up, please make sure you do so before the Challenge starts. Best to do it now in case you forget - late entries will not be accepted.</p>
<p>Similarly if you’ve already signed up but want to change the method you have registered, don’t forget to let me know before the start of the Challenge.</p>
<p>I think <a href="../blog/Lenten Challenge 2019 - for your diary.html">the list</a> is complete, but if anyone has been missed out, please let me know as soon as possible.</p>
<p>You can sign on or amend your entry either by email (see right tab on top menu) or by comment box (it doesn’t matter which post you put your comment on - I see all new comments together).</p></div>

<div>Glad I started a few days early, staying consistent is needing some practice.  Getting better, but still slipping.</div>

<div>Please change mine to be Every-Other-Day rather than Daily, since that's what I'll probably do.<br><br>Also, will we do updates, and if so, how? Thread per week? Thread per participant? Thread per type of system?</div>

<div>Should we distinguish between falling off the wagon (and climbing back on again) and abandoning the wagon?</div>

<div>Please count me in with T7P10, a system I developed during the last year. T7P10 uses a combination of a weekbased task journal and some index cards for bigger projects.</div>

<div>Chris Cooper:<br><br><< Should we distinguish between falling off the wagon (and climbing back on again) and abandoning the wagon? >><br><br>No, if you fall off the wagon you have failed the challenge. There's nothing to stop you re-starting again of course - but not as part of the challenge.</div>

<div>So does my goal of reviewing status every other day fit? I won't meet every day, but not missing two days in a row might be doable. (I'm going to keep it as a personal challenge, even if it doesn't qualify for the official one.)</div>
