<h1>Blog Subjects (proposed by Facebook followers)</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2016-05-31 7:00</div>
<div class="content"><p>Here’s the list of replies to my post on Facebook asking for suggestions for blog subjects. I think they are all good suggestions, so I’ll start working my way through them at intervals over the next few weeks.</p>
<ul>
<li><span><span><span class="UFICommentBody"><span>I think you should write an autobiography - a blog article would be a great place to start. <span class="accessible_elem"> </span></span></span></span></span></li>
<li><span> <span><span class="UFICommentBody"><span>Checklists ?</span></span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span class="UFICommentBody"><span>Multiple sequenced action projects with fvp? </span></span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span class="UFICommentBody"><span>Nolist?</span></span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span class="UFICommentBody"><span>How  to identify the less obvious backlogs and work them all. I suspect that  simply setting up current initiatives to (1) fix the systems and (2)  hack away at or explode the backlogs in sequence might not be the best  approach. But this is only conjecture.</span></span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span class="UFICommentBody"><span>Outliner. Mind mapping. Scatter map.Tools to capture thoughts.Organize thoughts.</span></span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span class="UFICommentBody"><span>Joe Cool and how he works.</span></span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span class="UFICommentBody"><span>You could use the Poll feature and seed it with a couple ideas, allowing everyone to vote and/or add their own.</span></span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span class="UFICommentBody"><span>No  list methods for a work environment that contains a lot of urgent  tasks. </span></span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span class="UFICommentBody"><span>I’d also like to see more love for FV (there’s good reason that  method got so much attention). Maybe articles about keeping the FV list  from expanding to an unmanageable length (I prefer FV to FVP because I  tended to procrastinate more with FVP since I would never get to the top  of the list (where all the tasks I was resisting resided).</span></span></span></span></li>
<li><span> <span><span class="UFICommentBody"><span>I’d  be interested in a blog post about the psychological forces that make  no list so addictive. On the surface it almost seems like just doing  whatever grabs my fancy. But somehow writing down what I am going to  work on makes it more focused.</span></span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span class="UFICommentBody"><span>Though  I much favour paper myself, I’d be interested in a consideration of  very basic to-do apps. I’m thinking particularly of Gina Trapani’s  (Lifehacker) todo.txt protocol that applies a simple format to plain  text editors.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<div>ddbordeaux:<br><br>I haven't had much chance to try it out yet. I read it over the last two weeks when I was touring in Romania. Now I'm back I hope to give it a better shot.</div>

<div>I’d be interested in a blog post about the psychological forces that make no list so addictive. On the surface ....<br><br>Mark, <br>Honestly I feel, 'Addictive' is the exact word for describing 'No List', I feel the 'high' while completing a task, and get craving, a empty, missing something, something not right feel if I am not on the lists. Some Brain Chemicals are surely triggered, Dopamine and what not i think.</div>
