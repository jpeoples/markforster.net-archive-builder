<h1>Thoughts on the Long List - High Speed High Volume</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2017-11-3 12:16</div>
<div class="content"><p>As I mentioned yesterday, a system which reduces resistance to zero is a real game-changer. So many of the concerns about time management vanish when you can simply do stuff. You don’t need to worry about the number of things you have to do, you don’t get backlogs building up, and you are not doing anything just as a way of avoiding something else.</p>
<p>It’s not just that you do the work faster. The work itself gets faster. Routines build up faster. Weeding gets faster. Follow up gets faster. Records are better kept. Problems get sorted quicker. Everything is up to date. You can find things faster. And above all knowing you are completely on top of your work gives you tremendous energy.</p>
<p>Sounds good?</p>
<p>More soon!</p></div>

<div>So is this the continuation of the experimentation you first mention way back in July?  The one that eventually gave us Real Autofocus?<br><br><a href="../blog/High Volume, High Speed, Low Resistance.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2017/7/1/high-volume-high-speed-low-resistance.html</a></div>

<div>nuntym:<br><br>Yes, but Real Autofocus was a side-product rather than the product itself.</div>

<div>Looking forward to this. Although I'm not sure if all Mark's progress going through his list is due to him being a very productive person. ;-)</div>

<div>Ron:<br><br>I think there's something about public confession that encourages focus .. or rather, FOCUS!</div>
