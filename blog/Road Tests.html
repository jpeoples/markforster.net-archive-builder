<div class="content"><p>After getting my road test of the "No S" Diet under way, there are some more which I want to write about. So a possible list of future roadlists would include:</p><p><em>Morning Pages (Journalling).</em> I have already written about this elsewhere but as I've recently re-started the practice, perhaps it's time for a revisit.</p><p><em>The Dogs of the FTSE/Dow.</em> A method of investing which I've been using over the last year and a half.</p><p><em>Brain Builder (Rocky Mountain Learning Systems).</em> A program which claims to build one's sequential memory which according to the publishers is one of the foundation blocks of thinking. I haven't started on this yet.</p><p>And I suppose since I'm calling this category "Road Tests", I could even report on a real car or two!</p></div>
