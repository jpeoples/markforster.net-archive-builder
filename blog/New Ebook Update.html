<h1>New Ebook Update</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2013-10-15 8:51</div>
<div class="content"><p>Sorry about the non-appearance of the ebook yesterday. The matter was entirely out of my hands.</p>
<p>According to the publisher yesterday evening (yesterday evening in UK that is):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re currently awaiting approval from Amazon’s submissions reviewers. In  Pacific time (currently 2:30pm) it should be approved either later tonight or  tomorrow, unless they have any change requests.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately I’m away for most of today, so I won’t be able to notify you until this evening at the earliest if the book appears today. Even if you see the book appear, you will need to wait for the code if you want the discounted price for readers of this blog.</p></div>
