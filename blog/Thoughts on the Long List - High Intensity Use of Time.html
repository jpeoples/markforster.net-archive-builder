<h1>Thoughts on the Long List - High Intensity Use of Time</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2017-11-4 20:35</div>
<div class="content"><p>Using my latest method, which is designed to be a High Intensity Use of Time, I have done 94 tasks out of 149 in the last 24 hours with 55 tasks remaining on the list, mostly re-entries.</p>
<p>During the day I was absent at a pub lunch with friends for four hours.</p>
<p>I experienced no resistance, got everything of importance done (and everything of lesser importance too). And instead of feeling exhausted, I have been getting steadily more energetic throughout the day.</p>

<div>Sounds impressive!<br>Out if interest, if you had used the simple scanning method, would you have completed the same number of tasks? I.e. What improvements do you envisage?<br>Can't wait for the new method.....</div>
