<h1>Dieting: The New Rule Starts Well</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2007-03-21 9:15</div>
<div class="content"><p>The new rule I introduced yesterday <a href="/blog/2007/3/20/dieting-a-new-rule.html">“Single Course Only”</a> showed its worth yesterday as this morning my target weight had dropped by 1.5 lbs. I’m now only 1.5 lbs behind where I would have been if I had not taken a week’s break at the beginning of the month.</p><p>There’s another reason for celebration: today I have lost overall 1 stone* since starting the diet at the beginning of December. That represents a steady loss of just under 1 lb per week. </p><p>* That’s 14 lbs or 6.4 kilos for those of you who don’t speak the Queen’s English!</p></div>

<div>Mark, <br><br>Congratulations on your weight-loss progress ! Emulation is my goal.<br><br>I note that you have an electronic weighing scales with which you appear to be happy. Would you recommend it ? All the ones I have seen so far have a rather small display.</div>

<div>Congratulations on the weight loss, Mark! I've been following your process with keen interest -- it seems to be a good system.<br><br>Do you think your weight will eventually just settle at what's "right" for your body (and if so, how will you know this from the system)? Or do you plan to aim for a set "ideal" weight?<br><br>Good luck with the next stone!<br><br>Ali</div>

<div>Hi, Fergus<br><br>My scales are made by Tefal. The display is quite legible to someone standing up straight.<br><br>They're about fifteen years old though - so probably the model is no longer available.</div>

<div>Hi, Ali<br><br>No, I don't think that the system will settle at what is right for my body. There's no mechanism for it to do that. I have a definite target weight that I am aiming for.<br><br>Once I've reached the target weight of course, all I have to do is to keep the same rules but keep the target weight the same.<br><br></div>
