<h1>The One Minute Rule</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2006-12-16 17:20</div>
<div class="content"><p>There’s a great post by Gretchen Rubin on her blog “The Happiness Project” on her “<a href="http://www.happiness-project.com/happiness_project/2006/12/need_a_simple_a.html" target="_blank">one-minute rule</a>”. </p><blockquote><p>It’s very simple: I must do any task that can be finished in one minute. Hang up my coat, read a letter and toss it, fill in a form, answer an email, note down a citation, pick up my phone messages, file a paper, put a dish in the dishwasher, replenish the diaper supply by the changing table, put the magazines away…and so on.</p></blockquote>If you live in chaos, most of the disorganisation isn’t caused by failing to do big things; it’s caused by failing to do thousands of tiny little things.</div>

<div>There's a somewhat tongue-in-cheek response to Gretchen's post on the Marginal Revolution blog:<br>Marginal Revolution: The One-Minute Rule<br><a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2006/12/the_oneminute_r.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2006/12/the_oneminute_r.html</a><br><br>MR is a blog written by some liberatarian economists at George Mason University. Quite enjoyable, in its way.<br></div>

<div>Posted in MR blog by her: "Someone posted to tell me about David Allen--shoot, I thought I was being so ingenious and original! and someone had thought of the very same idea before."<br><br>"Two-Minute Rule" from David Allen's Getting Things Done book is a much better approach. Its intention  is to show how many things we can accomplish in a short interval. Plus this rule has a proper phase to be applied, that is while processing. Otherwise, we can do a lot of little things to avoid the real work.<br><br>Other methods like Sandra Felton "Messies Anonymous" www.messies.com or Fly Lady introduce this concept in a better way. It is also mentioned in many ADD websites as an important tip for people easily distracted.<br><br>Silvia</div>

<div>I think it's important here to distinguish between Gretchen's one-minute rule and David Allen's two-minute rule. They are not quite the same thing.<br><br>The one-minute rule is about putting things away when we've finished with them, hanging our coats up rather than leaving them on the chair, filing papers rather than leaving them in a pile, that sort of thing. These are all things which should never get to the stage of needing to be a formal "task".<br><br>I know Gretchen mentions dealing with things like e-mails, which overlap with David Allen's 2-minute rule, but I think she's wrong there. The one-minute rule is not about how to deal with tasks, but about how to stop things becoming tasks in the first place. As such it is very valuable.</div>

<div>hum... I think this is MF's one-minute rule and it is a very good rule indeed."How to stop things becoming tasks in the first place.<br>The one-minute rule is about putting things away when we've finished with them". Thanks.<br><br></div>
