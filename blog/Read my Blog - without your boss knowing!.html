<h1>Read my Blog - without your boss knowing!</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2007-01-9 11:34</div>
<div class="content"><p>You can now read my blog at work without anyone being able to identify what you are reading. You will see the following icon now appears in the left side-bar. If you click on it, it will give you a text-only version of my website. </p><p>Please note the <strong>Boss Key</strong> which will remove all the text if your boss gets too close (you don't have to click on it - just move the cursor over it).</p><p><script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.workfriendly.net/script/workfriendly.js"></script></p><p>And when you've finished reading my blog, you can go on to surf the rest of the web in the same way!</p></div>

<div>Interestingly enough, the "Work Friendly" button doesn't show up on the page when I'm at work but it does at home! <br><br>Looks like my employer is wise to it!</div>
