<h1>Looking for a new name</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2010-01-31 7:44</div>
<div class="content"><p>The new system I’m working on was provisionally called DIT2. But that doesn’t really apply any longer since the latest changes I have made make it far less like “Do It Tomorrow”. In fact about the only similarity now is that they both use a page-a-day diary to write tasks in.</p>
<p>It doesn’t bear much resemblance to Autofocus either, so calling it AF5 isn’t going to work either.</p>
<p>Hmm…</p></div>

<div>Like almost everything else these days it should have a lowercase i at the beginning.  Like iDIT or iTrack.  But then it sounds rubbish.<br><br>You ideally want to be able to, in a conversation, be able to say aloud, "i'm curretnly using a productivity system called (fill in the blank)" without feeling embarressed.  What about FLOW and don't worry that its not an acronym or anyting else.  Its a statement of what your trying to achieve by using such as system.<br><br>So - FLOW is my suggestion.  If it needs something for marketing purposes because FLOW is just a word --- iFLOW.  And if you don't adopt the system...<br><br>uSINK<br><br>Thanks.</div>

<div>I like Claudia's suggestions above (especially DailyFocus). Some others on the same line that may stir some new ideas:<br><br>ActionFocus<br>PageFocus<br>SamePage<br>DailyAction<br><br>However, for me, "Autofocus" still remains as the coolest name of them all.</div>

<div>I agree with Luciano - AutoFocus is THE BEST name ... I wonder if you could just bring out the new AutoFocus and explain that v1-4 were all just in the Beta stage?<br><br>OR<br><br>iFocus (I like this because it fits the trend Roger mentions, but it also says, "I am focused."<br><br>AutoFocusToday (AFT)</div>

<div>Another vote for Flow.  Suggest some bigger phrase including Flow.</div>

<div>I never cared for the name Do It Tomorrow - it implies a handbook promoting procrastination!  For that reason, I probably never would have read the book if it had not been recommended on one of my email lists.  I still like the name "AutoFocus" with 'iFocus" following a close second.  DIT had a huge impact on my business and personal productivity.  I prefer electronic tools but have incorporated DIT and AF into my system.</div>

<div>Do It Today<br><br>or AFD is a good idea too.</div>

<div>Reading over everyone's suggestions, for which many thanks, I've realised that the name that best describes the system is in fact AutoFocus. It's just that it's very different from the previous AFs and doesn't use the same type of list. So special thanks to Luciano.<br><br>I might find myself following Claudia's suggestion.</div>

<div>How about Autodirect (direct-aim attention at)<br>or Auto-motive</div>

<div>FUTURE FOCUS  <br><br> 'Do it Tomorrow' is a future-focused system, and AF5, is also future-focused as we are putting our tasks on pages we will arrive at in the future.<br>'Future' has a positive feel to it.  <br>'Focus' has a powerful feel to it.<br>So I propose the name 'Future Focus' particularly as our business language is all about 'getting ahead'.<br><br>Working with 'Backlog' implies your work is greater than your ability to handle it.  But looking ahead to see what else can be done, if you can fit more in, is literally 'Looking Forward to Work'.  That is a GREAT motivator to get things done, as you will feel head of your game.  <br><br>So I propose 'Future Focus' because it is a positive accurate description, and is suited to 'go-getters'.  If you mention your organisational method is 'Future Focus' iit has a good ring to it.  Future Focus: I like it.</div>

<div>I was keen on 'Future Focus' until I realized I hadn't alluded to its organic nature.<br><br>Intrinsic Focus? <br>Hey, I like the initials: 'IF'<br>IF you can keep your head while all about you are losing theirs...</div>
