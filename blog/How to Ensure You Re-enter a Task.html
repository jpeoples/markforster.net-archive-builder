<h1>How to Ensure You Re-enter a Task</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2021-03-7 16:30</div>
<div class="content"><p>If you’ve ever found that sometimes you forget to re-enter a recurring or uncompleted task at the end of a long list, then here’s the solution.</p>
<p>It all lies in the order in which you do these three actions:</p>
<p>1) Select the next task</p>
<p>2) Dot it</p>
<p>3) Do it</p>
<p>4) Re-enter it</p>
<p>But if you do them in that order, then you are running a risk of forgetting action 4) re-entering the task.</p>
<p>It’s far better to do them in this order:</p>
<p>1) Select the next task</p>
<p>2) Re-enter it</p>
<p>3) Dot it</p>
<p>4) Do it</p>
<p>If you are using a pre-dotted system like FVP, then just re-enter the task <em>before</em> you start working on it.</p>
<p>If you do it like this, you will never forget to re-enter a task again.</p></div>

<div>I can't say this has really been a problem for me, not that I never forget.  The solution doesn't suit me anyway in my chosen digital medium.  I don't scratch off done tasks, I send them to the end.  If I did that before doing the work, I would lose my spot in the list because it's no longer there!</div>

<div>As you say, it's easy to forget to re-enter a task.  I do re-entering in this order:<br><br>1) Select task.<br>2) Dot it<br>3) Re-enter it<br>4) Do it<br><br> When I was re-entering as the last step, I felt I had to remind myself that I wasn't there to add a new task, only to do a re-entry.  For some reason, doing it in the order above means my focus is on going back to the task I've just selected, not having reached the end of the list.</div>

<div>Margaret1:<br><br>The only problem I could see happening with the order you do it in is that dotting a task is usually done just before doing it. So you may sometimes find yourself doing it, rather than re-entering it. Especially if you've been used to doing it in the order 1) Select the next task 2) Dot it 3) Do it 4) Re-enter it. <br><br>But if it works fine for you stick to it.</div>

<div>Thanks Mark - yes, it works for me.   Dotting the task helps me find it again easily when I've done the re-entering.  In fact, I actually do a double dot - that stands out even more.  Another thing I've started doing is to use a bright highlighter pen for items I've worked on, rather than crossing them out.  The unhighlighted tasks are easier to find, and if I want to check back through what I've worked on, it's easier to read than when it's crossed out.</div>
