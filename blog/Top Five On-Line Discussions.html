<div class="content"><p>Congratulations everyone! We have been featured on <a href="http://tinyurl.com/6ytdfd">Whakake’s Top Five Online Discussion Picks </a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Mark Forster’s forums on his website and the Yahoo! Groups had many excellent topics, including how to tackle large projects and how to overcome a lack of motivation. Mark Forster gave his insight on these issues: the “Do It Tomorrow” (DIT) system gives the user complete freedom on how to tackle a large project, whether it comes down to finishing it at one sitting, working on it for a set period of time,or spending “timed bursts” of five minutes to get going. These fundamental methods to DIT (including working out daily closed lists) also help a person stay on top of work and hence stay motivated.”</p>

<div>Congratulations. <br><br>I had almost forgotten about the Yahoo group. I'm wondering when it's more suitable to use the forum and when to use the Yahoo group.</div>

<div>Although I'm a member of it, the Yahoo group is quite independent of me and I am not the owner or moderator. It tends to be much wider-ranging than the discussions here, and doesn't confine itself to "Do It Tomorrow" in spite of the name of the group. There's also much less input by myself - I comment only occasionally and don't necessarily read all the posts. Some of the discussions are very helpful and participants are very honest about their difficulties.<br><br>On this forum I will reply to all the posts and comments that seem to need a reply. The discussion is much more focussed specifically on my work, and to some extent acts as a "help line".</div>
