<div>I built a new productivity system using weighted randomisation since the last time around (which was hampered by somewhat seismic life events). I have not as yet named the system, but I guess we should for the purposes of the challenge. Let us go with... Prioritised Shuffling. A lousy name, but it will tide us over for now.<br><br>I have had a little go with it and made some tweaks, but I will try to use it in its current form for the duration of the challenge unless I can see that there is a clear bug causing it not to prioritise the right things at the right times.</div>

<div>LAPS.  <br><br>It’s a short-list system (not a long list, nor a no-list) with some planning elements in it.  I may discuss more in the forum.</div>

<div>Randomizer Execute/Explore variant:<br><br>This is based on Randomizer but with pages grouped for "execute"-type tasks (simple tasks, recurring tasks, things with deadlines) and "explore"-type tasks (reading, open-ended projects, ideas, and "execute"-type things that need to be unstuck).<br><br>It's kind of fluid at the moment, and not much else to say yet, but I intend to stick with it for awhile and see where it goes. <br><br><a href="../blog/Random Time Management.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2014/1/22/random-time-management.html</a></div>

<div>Hi Mark<br><br>Could you alter my choice to Austin’s “Simple new system “<br><br>Thank you.</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Jacqueline - 2023-02-21 2:47</div>
<div>I'm going to choose Austin's Simple System as well (Thanks Calibre for introducing it to me!)<br>I've been doing an Unstructured AF1 in a weekly page Hobonichi for several years now.  Look forward to something new for a change.</div>

<div>I enjoy watching Mark's choice shift from day to day. :) <br><br>For my own entry, I think I'm going to try a new approach I'm building around Eat the Frog. I think I like calling it the Frog and Chain system. I just started it, so I think I'll try to see if I can use it through Lent as a test of its "staying power".</div>

<div>I'm very excited about this Lenten Challenge - lovely to see the forum being lit up with new enthusiasm, and to see new contributors as well as the golden oldies.<br><br>I'm going with (Seraphim's) Serial No List, possibly using 3T (3 Tasks system) to process it.<br><br>For the first three weeks of the challenge I'll be in my normal environment with a lot of discretionary time, but for the second three weeks I'll be in a much more pressurised environment with less discretionary time.  If I had six weeks in my normal environment I would have been more adventurous and happy to experiment with something different, such as AF4/3T, which I didn't try out first time round, but during the second three weeks I need a system with minimal overhead and very little compulsion to follow set processing algorithms.  (This is not a criticism of any system - usually I love the gamification of following algorithms - but I know from my experience so far that in pressurised periods I don't have the bandwidth).<br><br>Good luck to everyone.</div>

<div>At some point I guess I have to stop lurking and bite the bullet, so…<br><br>Mark, please sign me up for 'Dreams', possibly with a side-order of SoPP/no-list…<br><br><br>[Any hints from experienced Dreamers will be gratefully received.]</div>

<div>I'm torn between Serial No-list or Gerry's old pdf of Ultra Simple Guide to Time Management (found during recent clean up of my macbook). <br><br>I'll go with Gerry's PDF instructions. The instructions allow for a 'hot list' of tasks, which could be satisfied by No-list with a rough sketch of the day ahead.</div>

<div>I was hoping to take part in the challenge (using DIT), but your website refused to accept comments from earlier. Trying once more in a private windows. At least the preview mode is working now.. Let's see if this one comes through.</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Ville - 2023-02-22 16:35</div>
<div>The comment came through this time (with typos). But is it too late to take part?</div>

<div>Oh. <br><br>It's that time of year again. <br><br>FWIW I'll be a relaxed FVP paper and pen (which means I won't be too concerned when I go off list) for the rest of Lent.<br><br>Nice to see people are still engaged.<br><br>Good luck, everyone!</div>

<div>Sorry, Mark, I'd missed this last week, but had already set DIT again as my Lent activity. And so far, so good ...</div>

<div>I wonder if I can still join.<br><br>Been developing a system I thought of since December last year I call Elastic AF, and finalized it more or less on February but then I got sick and hospitalized. Now I'm out and raring to use this method, it's pretty dope IMHO.</div>

<div>@Laby<br><br>Sorry for the late reply, I have been meaning to answer back. However, I get tired easily lately because of my condition, and combined with my inability to think of a way to make it work on paper and pen (it is a strictly electronic system for now, on Obsidian) I kept on delaying my post.<br><br>With that I decided to just make a post of it in the General Forum titled "ElasticAF: a strictly electronic system" or some such in a day of two.</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Mike Brown - 2023-04-4 2:24</div>
<div>I'm tapping out as well. I have so many pages of different lists that I'm absolutely lost. I'm starting to lose track of things.<br><br>Moving back to Remember the Milk for my online task tracking, while still using pen and paper to scratch out a rough hourly schedule and no-list for each day. I was using this hybrid method before the Lenten Challenge to stay on top of stuff flying at me, while having some direction for the day. I liked it a lot.<br><br>Not sure what I'll do with all those pages. Perhaps they'll go into a notebook or perhaps I'll trash them and start fresh.</div>
