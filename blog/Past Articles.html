<div class="meta">Posted: 2012-01-24 1:28</div>
<div class="content"><p>When I was preparing the Articles tab, I went back and looked through all the past articles in order to make sure they were tagged as Articles. In the process I came across quite a few old articles which I think I think are worth reviving. Some of them I’d even forgotten that I’d written!</p>
<p>Here’s a short selection of the ones I like best:</p>
<p><a href="../blog/From Pipe-Dream to Project.html">From Pipe Dream to Project</a></p>
<p><a href="../blog/The Problem with Deadlines.html">The Problem with Deadlines</a></p>
<p><a href="../blog/Vague Goals.html">Vague Goals</a></p>
<p><a href="../blog/Friction.html">Friction</a></p>
<p><a href="../blog/Feeling Good.html">Feeling Good</a></p></div>
