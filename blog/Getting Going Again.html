<h1>Getting Going Again</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2008-01-7 11:29</div>
<div class="content"><p>I have been conscious for a while that I have been neglecting this blog and my newsletter, and one of my New Year resolutions has been to get back into full-scale production. </p><p>The main reason I have not been writing very much over the past year has been that I have spent most of that year experimenting with some new methods of time management. Unfortunately they haven’t worked very well!</p><p>I’ve always seen myself as someone whose main calling is to experiment, rather than to find one answer which I then write about for evermore. The problem with experimenting is that by its very nature more experiments go wrong than go right. But one of life’s lessons is that it’s only by being willing to be wrong that you can discover the right answers.</p><p>Towards the end of last year I was beginning to feel that I really am making some positive progress. You will probably be able to judge by the quantity and quality of postings on this blog over the next few months whether the new ideas are actually working, or whether it will have to be back to the drawing board again.</p><p>So watch this space!</p></div>

<div>Thanks for experimenting.  That allows us to keep practicing on the tried and true until you've found better methods for us.</div>

<div>Hi Mark,  Great to see you blogging again.  I was concerned that you had given up.  Something like the above post before your experimental period would have explained the lack of activity.  This would mean I wouldn't have contemplated removing the blog feed due to the lack of activity.  Which would have been a great loss! Rgds Rob.</div>

<div>Hi, Rob<br><br>I'm always experimenting, and it's not possible to tell which are going to result in a complete breakdown of work before one starts unfortunately!</div>

<div>I very much appreciate the kind of self-experimentation you're talking about, Mark. A good way to live, I think - as long as one's happy with the consequences!<br><br>Glad you're back.</div>

<div>Always come up with three solutions or possible answers.<br><br>That way, you will always be wrong more often than you are right and know it.</div>
