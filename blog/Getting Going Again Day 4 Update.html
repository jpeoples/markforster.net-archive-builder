<h1>Getting Going Again: Day 4 Update</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2008-02-23 13:51</div>
<div class="content"><p>My intention today was to only work in the morning, which I didn’t quite keep to. I had to do another 20 minutes work after lunch (including this blog entry) in order to finish my Will Do list. Not too bad… now we’re off to walk round the gardens at <a href="http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-vh/w-visits/w-findaplace/w-polesdenlacey.htm" target="_blank">Polesden Lacey</a>, one of my favourite spots in the entire world.</p><p>Tomorrow (Sunday) my intention is not to switch the computer on all day. So no update until Monday.</p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0340909129?tag=markforstthet-21&camp=1406&creative=6394&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=0340909129&adid=04WWDDGHJG5BEQBRWM66&" target="_blank"><span class="sizeLess20"><u><font style="color: #800080" color="#800080">Buy Do It Tomorrow</font></u></span></a></p></div>

<div>I'm getting your posts via email, and I must say it's very inspiring to read about your getting back up to speed. It's strangely helpful to observe the advice-giver in the process of heeding his own advice! Reading something like "I got everything done before lunch" makes me realize how much I need to re-start my own systems. Please keep the entries coming.<br><br>ds</div>
