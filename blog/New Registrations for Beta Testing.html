<div class="meta">Posted: 2009-01-5 21:19</div>
<div class="content"><p>Several people have written to me asking if they are too late to join the Beta testing. The answer is that Beta testers are still very much welcome.</p>
<p>To sign up go to the Email Newsletter sign up box in the right hand margin, enter your email address and when the next page comes up tick the Beta Testing box.</p>
<p>If you are already signed up for my newsletter this box will not appear. Instead press the Submit button and you will be sent an email with instructions about how to change your subscription details.</p>
<p>I send out the Autofocus instructions on a daily basis to all new subscribers. You should therefore receive them either the day you subscribe or the following day.</p></div>
