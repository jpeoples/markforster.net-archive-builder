<h1>Blog Now Fully Back to Normal (I think)</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2022-12-24 10:34</div>
<div class="content"><p>This blog is now back to normal as far as I can see. Apparently the whole upset was caused by one misplaced “>” in an HTML sequence in a post. As there are a huge number of posts on this blog, it took a long time to track down.</p>
<p>Troubles always come in threes, so they say, and I was also having unrelated problems at the same time with my domain name (markforster.net) and my email address. I am pleased to say that these have now been fixed too. <br><br>As a result:</p>
<p>1) you can use markforster.net or markforster.squarespace.com as before</p>
<p>2) you can email me on either mf@markforster.net or markforster@aol.com. It doesn’t matter which you use, but please don’t use both at the same time</p>
<p>Thanks everyone for your patience.</p></div>

<div>Welcome back!  VERRY weird that a blog post with whatever content could mess up the entire site!</div>

<div>Yes, I got an alert on this post through my feedly RSS reader, so glad to know it is up, and more importantly, can receive your tips on new ways to process tasks.</div>

<div>How wonderful to see a new blog post again, Mark!  Well done getting the site up and running.<br><br>Under the TM Systems tab, the links beginning http: are fine, but some of the system descriptions only come up with the message "Domain not Claimed".  No doubt this will all come out in the wash.</div>

<div>Alan Baljeu:<br><br>I think it was actually one of my comments, rather than a blog post. But still, very weird and the last sort of thing I was looking for. It was the Help at Squarespace that found it after a lot of looking.</div>

<div>Margaret1:<br><br><< some of the system descriptions only come up with the message "Domain not Claimed" >><br><br>I was having trouble with the domain name as well and I don't think that's fully sorted out yet, but at least it's working well enough to resume normal service.</div>

<div>Mark - a lot of direct links to posts/comments fail to load with the same error "Domain not claimed". I find that replacing the markforster.net with markforster.squarespace.com fixes the problem and loads those pages just fine. Perhaps the .net domain somehow fails to register as working.</div>

<div>Oh, great! Mark, I love the DIT system I learned about from reading your book, and refer to your blog frequently. Thanks for all your share!</div>

<div>Hi Mark, I notice your site is still having issues. I'm a web developer - let me know if I can help. I do this kind of stuff every day. Thanks for your wonderful productivity systems - I'm just getting back into them!</div>
