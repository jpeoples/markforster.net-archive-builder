<h1>Dieting at Christmas</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2006-12-22 14:52</div>
<div class="content"><p>The Christmas season is now well under way <em>chez Forster</em>, and a great party on Wednesday evening has resulted in my being over the target weight for two days running. Accordingly I have now got two rules in force: </p><ol dir="ltr"><li><div style="margin-right: 0px">No second helpings</div></li><li><div style="margin-right: 0px">Three meals a day only (no snacking)</div></li></ol><p>No great deprivation there yet then, but it will be interesting to see how far up the rules ladder I will get before the season of good cheer is over. The good cheer will be rather limited though as - due to a dodgy tooth - I have been put on a strong antibiotic. This means that I am on a third rule (not part of the diet): No alcohol!</p><p>Full details of the diet I am following can be found <a href="/blog/2006/12/4/can-i-improve-on-the-no-s-diet.html"><font style="color: #0072bc" color="#0072bc">here.</font></a></p></div>
