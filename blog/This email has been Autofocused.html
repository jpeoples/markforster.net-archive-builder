<div class="content"><p>It’s great to hear from the blog comments and Discussion Forum posts how so many people are already beginning to find the benefits of the Autofocus system.</p>
<p>So I expect you want to tell all your friends, family, clients, bosses, colleagues, etc, about it.</p>
<p>One way you can do this very easily is by adding the following line to your e-mail signature:</p>
<p>This e-mail has been <a href="../blog/New Developments Testers Wanted.html">Autofocused</a></p>
<p>You can copy it straight off this page!</p>
<p><em><span style="font-size: 80%;">This blog post has been <a href="../blog/New Developments Testers Wanted.html">Autofocused</a></span></em></p></div>

<div>Hi Mark<br><br>I'd love to add "This email has been Autofocused" to my standard email signature but can't seem to get it to cut and paste the hotlink. Also when I click on the highlighted Autofocused bit in your email signature (on an email you sent me recently) it seems to link to Autofocus: The Book Selection - not sure if that's the section you meant it to?<br><br>I'm still loving Autofocus, am getting loads more done, capturing everything I want as well as slipping in the odd out of sequence item without seeming to damage the system much at all as it's so flexible!<br><br>Thanks so much.</div>

<div>Hannah:<br><br>Depending on what you are copying it into you may need to enter the link manually.<br><br>Thanks for telling me about the wrong link for the signature - that must have crept in somehow when I updated it a couple of days ago. I've now changed it.<br><br>Glad you're getting on so well with the system.</div>
