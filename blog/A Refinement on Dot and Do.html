<h1>A Refinement on "Dot and Do"</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2016-07-16 7:00</div>
<div class="content"><p>In <a href="../blog/A Simple Amendment to the Random Method.html">yesterday’s post</a> I suggested that the “dot and do” approach could be done anytime</p>
<p>However I think a more structured approach would be helpful and so I suggest something on these lines.</p>
<p>When moving to a new task, use the Randomizer to select the task as usual</p>
<p>Review any tasks marked as time-sensitive which lie between the task you have just finished and the task which the Randomizer has just landed on.</p>
<p>For example your Randomizer throws an 18. You have two time-sensitive tasks marked, one at 5 and one at 13. What do you do?</p>
<ol>
<li>Dot the task at 18.</li>
<li>Examine the task at 5 and decide whether it should be done now.</li>
<li>If yes, do it. If no, leave it where it is.</li>
<li>Examine the task at 13 and decide whether it should be done now</li>
<li>If yes, do it. If no, leave it where it is.</li>
<li>Do the task at 18.</li>
<li>Throw the Randomizer for the next task.</li>
</ol>
<p>One word of caution. Mark tasks in this way very sparingly. Remember that whenever you increase the priority of a task, you are at the same time reducing the priority of everything else. So keep it for when it’s really needed. Don’t do it as a matter of routine. The basic rule is that the Randomizer should select the next task to be done whenever possible.</p>

<div>Mark, one question about the "dot and do" approach in both this post and your last one. If you recommend a sparing use of this, and only for time-sensitive tasks, am I right to think that you don't recommend it for started-but-unfinished tasks? I ask this because I'm tempted to use "dot and do" for such tasks to encourage a "little and often" approach. But I take it you think "little and often" will be sufficiently addressed just by limiting the total number of tasks, and keeping that number to a manageable size? (Maybe I should add that it was the "little and often" approach to unfinished tasks that attracted me to your "random ammendment" in that post from a few days ago.)</div>
