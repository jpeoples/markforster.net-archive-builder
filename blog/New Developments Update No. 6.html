<h1>New Developments Update No. 6</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2009-01-3 22:33</div>
<div class="content"><p>I’m just in the process of finishing my final draft of the instructions for the Autofocus system, which are due to go out on Monday. At the moment there are 1,304 people signed up for the Beta testing so I think I am going to have plenty of correspondence once people start trying the new system out.</p>
<p>It’s still working brilliantly for me - in spite of the fact that I have deliberately been trying to overload it - something which is only too easy to do with most time management systems. The most exciting part for me has been that it has kept me concentrating on what is really important without my necessarily being clear what that is. What I mean is that it’s only with hindsight, looking on back on what I’ve done, that I can see what the system is putting the emphasis on and what it is rejecting. Just about always it’s clear to me that the system has caused me to made better choices than I would have on my own.</p>
<p>Now that life is returning to normal after the Christmas and New Year lull, I expect to find that the emphasis will change - it’ll be interesting to see how.</p></div>

<div>Hi Mark<br><br>Congratulations too on the number of beta testers!  <br><br>I am totally intrigued as to how the "system" will automatically "accept" or "reject" items.  I have so many things that I have to do but don't want to do, that I know my natural inclination would be to reject them (even though I know I would be better served to do them), and other things that I want to do but would naturally reject because I would feel I "ought" to be doing something else - and then there's just those things that I never have (make?) time for ...........<br><br>You now have over 1300 very curious people out here Mark  :-)</div>

<div>Christine:<br><br>The system works by providing a framework which balances the rational and intuitive parts of the brain. <br><br>What happens if we try to run things with our rational brain is that we make plans which our minds subvert because our minds don't work on purely rational grounds. As you say, you know (with your rational brain) that you would be better served to do certain things, but nevertheless your natural inclination is to reject them.<br><br>If we try to run things with our natural inclinations we have a tendency to drift, become impulsive and act irrationally.<br><br>However when these two ways of thinking are in balance we are able make rational decisions which are fully in accord with our deeper feelings and emotions. The new system provides a framework which enables this. Although I talk about "the system" making the choices, what I really mean is that the system provides a framework which allows us to make these balanced decisions ourselves in a non-stressful way.</div>

<div>Hi Mark,<br><br>Hope all goes well during this new year - I've read "Do It Tomorrow" and I'll keep myself updated on your new Autofocus system!</div>

<div>Mark, that sounds fantastic.  So often I feel trapped between what I want to do, what I "ought" to do and what, quite frankly, just jumps up and demands to be done regardless of my own opinions.  If there is some way that will enable me (or "the system") to identify what I really should (for want of a better word) be doing, that will enable me not only to do it without guilt but to be able to put aside other time demands, then that will be truly amazing.<br><br>Whilst it really does sound too good to be true I know from your conferences that you really do deliver on what you say. I really admire the fact that you continue to develop your systems and "add-ons" which results in techniques that really do have something for everyone.<br><br>So glad you didn't "just retire"!!!</div>

<div>Hi Mark, I am just *itching* to get started on this new system!  I havean electronic "to do" list on my organiser which after some rationalisation over the Xmas holiday still stands at 142 items!  Hopefully this new system will enable me to make some inroads into the list and work on the items that are important but don't always seem to be the most pressing, interesting or enjoyable as others!<br><br>Carole</div>

<div>So today is "auto focus eve" and for me it can't come soon enough. My biggest issue has been paralysis by analysis; I try so hard to find THE productivity solution only to be a whole lot less productive. Mark, I can't wait to see how you have managed to work your magic this time. Thank you so much for everything you do. <br><br>As it happens I'm getting married in Horsham (South Lodge) this year. I may be compelled to extend an invitation to you if this works! <br><br>Very excited,<br><br>Simon</div>
