<h1>Want to solve problems while you sleep?</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2007-01-9 17:10</div>
<div class="content"><p>An interesting post on <a href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifehack/want-to-solve-problems-while-you-sleep-have-a-drink.html" target="_blank">lifehack.com </a>today by Tony D. Clark about how he solves problems in his sleep by drinking half a glass of water before he goes to sleep and the other half before he gets up. He claims it is a great way of providing eureka moments.</p><blockquote><p>I discovered a trick about 12 years ago that has served me well - and I’ve recommended it many times, to clients, friends, and family. I can’t remember where I first learned about it, but it’s one of my favorite techniques for using the power of sleep to work out problems. And all you need are a pen, paper, and a glass of water.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">I think I'll try it out. Though not tonight, as I've got to be up early tomorrow morning because I giving a seminar in the City. Has anyone else tried a similar method?</p></div>
