<h1>4 Hour Workweek Checklist</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2008-10-7 15:50</div>
<div class="content"><p>CEO Bernard Sandoval of Sandia has developed a check-list for his employers based on some of the principles in Tim Ferriss’s book <em>The 4-Hour Work Week</em>. The principles are very similar to those in Do It Tomorrow and can easily be adapted if you wish to use them.</p><p><a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/sandia-4hww-corporate-guide-being-more-productive-2.pdf" target="_blank">Download it here</a>.<br></p></div>

<div>This is a great resource to keep handy.  As a freelance designer/developer it is easy to find myself spending time doing things that are fascinating, but not producing income.  Keeping some boundaries in place to keep work time blocked away from personal time is essential.  <br><br>Thanks for posting it!</div>

<div>Sri<br><br>Sorry that you can't open the file - it's working fine for me. I'm also using Acrobat 8 and have opened the file successfully with Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari and Google Chrome.<br><br>I can't do anything about it because the file isn't held on my site. The link is to the 4-Hour Work Week site <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.fourhourworkweek.com</a> .<br><br>Mark</div>

<div>Thanks for sharing this one -- it was pretty interesting that they would be so prescriptive to their employees, and at the same time not create a context in which it is understood that each person should be creating a system of their own a la Time Management 2.0</div>

<div>#16 about crackberry/mobile phone restrictions is a tough one to follow if you are a wage slave and expected to answer the da%n thing for support calls etc. However, when working on my own business I see the benefits.<br><br>I think the bottom line question is "How much is my time worth?" A lot of task management and delegation activities fall out of the answer.</div>

<div>Mark:<br><br>It's an interesting point you make about seeing the benefits when working on your own business. I never keep my cell phone switched on while in the office either.<br><br>This memo was written by a CEO and therefore his employees would be expected to obey it. But I agree that a wageslave would be unable to initiate this on their own behalf.<br><br>I often find that when I give a time management seminar in a firm, it's the entire culture of the place that needs changing. Only the people right at the top can do this of course, and they often think themselves above attending a seminar!</div>
