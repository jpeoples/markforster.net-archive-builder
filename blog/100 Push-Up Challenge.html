<div class="content"><p>When I produced the latest version of SuperFocus, I used “Read War and Peace” as an example of how the method could keep one going during a project which required consistent effort over a period.</p>
<p>I thought I’d better do something similar for “Dreams” so I’ve decided on something a lot harder. I’ve decided to go for the <a href="http://hundredpushups.com/">100 Push-Ups Challenge</a>. You will see from the previous post that I have put it in my Future Reality.</p>
<p>At the age of 67 I don’t expect to go from my current ability to do six push-ups to being able to do one hundred in only six weeks. I will almost certainly take a lot longer and may never get there. But the important thing is to keep going and give it the best try I can.</p>
<p>I’ll give regular reports so you can see how effective Dreams is in keeping the vision going!</p>

<p>First time I’ve been able to do more than the minimum in the last set. But I expected to be able to do a lot more. It is indeed a case of two steps forward, one step back.</p>

<p>Failed again, but a marked improvement over last week, when I failed in Set 2. And, as Marcelo says, I’m now a double-digit pushupper!</p>

<p>Disappointing that I was no better than on my first try. However I know very well that it’s often a case of two steps forward, one step back, so the real test will be later this week.</p>

<p>Same number of pushups in total as Day 2 but leading with 8 instead of 6. I’m pretty sure that if the set of 10 had been first I could have done at least 9. Next week I will repeat Week 1. (Note: I e-mailed Steve Speirs, the author of the program, to ask if it was best to repeat Day 2 or have a go at Day 3 and he replied to have a go at Day 3).</p>

<div>I thought you needed to choose some compelling vision to succeed. Do you find 100 pushups compelling?</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">avrum - 2011-06-12 15:45</div>
<div>Two things;<br><br>1. I did the challenge a few years ago. Unfortunately I had a nagging rotator cuff injury, that morphed into full blown frozen shoulder (partly due to this challenge). To be clear, the injury was due to an ice hockey injury and not the challenge itself. <br><br>2. I would love to hear how you differentiation between push and pull energy, and what you do about it.</div>
</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Mark Forster - 2011-06-12 19:02</div>
<div>Alan:<br><br>The compelling part of the vision is not in the 100 push-ups itself, but in the part of my Future Reality which deals with being extremely fit and full of energy</div>

<div>avrum:<br><br>Fortunately I don't have any shoulder injuries, but I will be being careful not to overdo it. My maxim with exercise has always been "If exercise makes the pain lessen, then carry on exercising. If exercise makes the pain worse, then stop."<br><br>Did you actually finish the challenge?</div>
</div>

<div class="comment-meta">avrum - 2011-06-12 19:45</div>
<div><<Did you actually finish the challenge? >><br><br>Officially, no. By that I mean, I never did 100 pushups in a row. Overtime, I was able to do 100 pushups throughout the day.</div>

<div>Mark:<br><br><<The compelling part of the vision is not in the 100 push-ups itself, but in the part of my Future Reality which deals with being extremely fit and full of energy>><br><br>If you currently are able to do only 6 push-ups in a row I guess your actual physical condition might not be your best. Starting by push-ups is not a good choice. You exercise mainly your pectorals and triceps (and transversal abdominal too, which is good), and put a lot of stress on your heart. If your aim is to be "extremely fit and full of energy" you better start by aerobic exercise (walking briskly and gradually moving to jogging -alternate 4 minutes walking with 1 minute running at the beginning, then increase to 3 minutes walking and 2 running and so on untill you run for 20 minutes in a row- or swimming if the impact is a problem, are good possibilities. Always exercise at least for 20 minutes). Once you get to an acceptable aerobic condition, which means that your heart is strong enough and your circulatory system is working properly (roughly, being able to run 2 kilometers in 12 minutes which in more specialized terminology correlates to VO2 max of 33.7 would be good enough) you can move to strength and flexibility, the two other major components of physical fitness.<br><br>Or take yoga or some other type of fitness class with a good instructor.<br><br>As I said in other thread, "little and often" is not enough. You also need to understand what you are doing... sorry for being very honest.</div>

<div>Thanks, Marcelo. My aerobic fitness is not too bad since my main hobby is long-distance walking.</div>

<div>Well done!<br><br>I'd be a bit careful about doing/overdoing the push ups though, sticking to 7 walks a week should be better.</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Greg Worrel - 2011-06-14 23:14</div>
<div>That is a coincidence.  I started the 100 pushups challenge in March. Just for good measure I also started the 200 squats, 50 pullups, and 200 situps challenges as well. I am generally very active and do cross-country ski races in the winter. I also play volleyball, bike, and roller-ski in the summer so I was just looking for something to mix things up.  <br><br>I started at 17 pushups. My last test, about a month ago, was 25.  My dedication has been erratic after the first 3 weeks or so.  The situps were hurting my back. The squats took a long time and are very demanding.  I have been stuck on the pushups at 12,17,13,10 of 13, and 5 of 17.  I haven't given up but the difficulty of getting to 100 pushups is very clear. The  suggested progression seems impossible, though I am 56 so maybe someone in their 20s can get better results.<br><br>I have found that once or twice a week gets me minimal or no progress, but sometimes that is all I do.  I am definitely stronger than when I started however, and a nagging shoulder injury from volleyball seems greatly improved. I have made progress in pullups and can do 7 which is much better than the 2 I could do at the start.  I have gone back to occasional weight room squats and situps and I am no longer trying to follow the program for those.<br><br>Good luck and I will be interested to see how it goes for you.</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Mark Forster - 2011-06-15 10:13</div>
<div>Greg:<br><br>I don't think I'd have tried all four programs at the same time - even the one is enough of a challenge for me!<br><br>Once a week is never enough to make progress. If you do a training session, the improvement is at its max after 2 or 3 days and then starts to decline. After 7 days it is back to where you started from. <br><br>I failed miserably today to do the targets for Week 1 Day 2. Oh, the shame of it! But even so I was able to do 8 press-ups instead of 6, and that was after previously doing a set of six. So the improvement has actually been huge.</div>
</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Marcelo - 2011-06-15 16:07</div>
<div>Greg:<br>Pushups, squats, pullups, situps: very good combination, all the major muscle groups. I would work out every day, each day on a different and only one group. Mark is right that for strength 2 or 3 days is the best interval, but even if you work on each group every fourth day it will give you good results and should smooth things out - plus you'll feel energized every day.<br><br>Mark:<br>From 6 to 8 in day 2, after a set of 6: that's very impressive!</div>

<div>Marcelo:<br><br><< Pushups, squats, pullups, situps: very good combination, all the major muscle groups. I would work out every day, each day on a different and only one group. >><br><br>That makes sense, though I would worry about what would happen if I had to miss a few days for any reason. The four day gap would very quickly become six or seven.<br><br><< From 6 to 8 in day 2, after a set of 6: that's very impressive! >><br><br>I thought so too! I'll repeat the Day on Friday and then repeat the Week from Day 1 starting next Monday. The progression seems to be pretty fearsome in the program, but I think the key is to keep going and not worry about taking a lot longer than the six weeks.</div>

<div>Mark, <br><br>You managed to get me in. I did my initial tests today:<br><br>Pushups: 25<br>Situps: 60<br>Squats: I stopped at 50 because at the site they classify 50 as excellent in the initial test. I know my legs are strong because of cycling so I don't really need squats.<br>Pullups: I can't figure out where to hang a bar.<br><br>So I'll start with pushups and situps on alternate days.<br><br>Starting tomorrow :)</div>

<div><<I'm expect you'll get to 100 before I get to 25! >><br><br>Don't worry, I'll wait for you :) Really, who cares: 6 weeks or 12 or 24, whatever, as long as we keep fit... that's the point.<br><br>So, my first day (pushups):<br>S1: 12 of 12<br>S2: 17 of 17<br>S3: 13 of 13<br>S4: 13 of 13<br>S5: 17 of "at least 17"<br><br>Not easy...</div>

<div>Marcelo:<br><br>Well done. That's a lot of pushups!<br><br>I'm just about to start on Day 3.</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Mark Forster - 2011-06-17 12:59</div>
<div>Failed again miserably, but in fact I'm quite encouraged because I definitely had at least one more pushup in me at the end of the first set of 8.<br><br>I also found it less exhausting than before and I've recovered much quicker.<br><br>You'll see in the up-date that I had an e-mail exchange with Steve Speirs the author of the program, who replied very quickly and helpfully twice.</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Marcelo - 2011-06-17 15:34</div>
<div>Go for that Day 3! Once you'll break the set of 10, you'll be in a completely different position: you'll be a Two Digits Pushuper!</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Mark Forster - 2011-06-17 23:32</div>
<div>Marcelo:<br><br>I also asked Steve how to maintain it once one has got to the 100 and his reply was:<br><br>"I hope to add some sort of maintenance plan to the web site at some stage in the near future. I typically go back to Week 3 or 4 and repeat the last few weeks of the program to help maintain strength/fitness. You can always repeat the whole program performing a more advanced push-up exercise (wide arm, narrow arm, medicine ball etc etc). My book details about a dozen "advanced" push-up exercises if you're interested."<br><br>I think you are likely to need that advice long before I do!</div>

<div><<And I am afraid second days are way harder...>><br><br>For me, once the novelty of an exercise program weans (particularly programs that require increased reps, leading to more of the same ol', same ol') , the actual exercises become physically harder to perform. Both a psychological and physical issue for me.</div>

<div>"Little & often" exercise!<br><br>Looking at these progressions, we can see Mark's "little and often" principle extended to fitness.<br><br>Though few of us can do 100 pushups all in one shot, we can get there in sets of 3, 5, 12, or what have you, by taking little breaks.<br><br>In sports science, this is called "volume training," or the principle that your total volume of weight lifted per unit time is the most important variable affecting your progress, more important than the breakdown of sets and reps (though of course sets and reps have their own secondary role).<br><br>In the same vein, when it comes to Getting Everything Done, what matters is our total volume of work completed, and it's no good burning ourselves out with marathon sessions.<br><br>Take breaks to get more done!</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Bernie - 2011-06-19 23:38</div>
<div>avrum,<br><br>You are not alone. Our bodies adapt to the stimulus and stop getting stronger, for neurological and other apparently complex reasons. This phenomenon is part of what has motivated "volume training" research.<br><br>New trainees often benefit from the same ol' same ol' for up to three months, but more experienced athletes can max out in as little as three weeks (the theory is that they were already near max capacity). The only remedy is constant change.<br><br>Happily, you do not have to change much, and it can be fun to experiment. With push-ups, you can try changing the placement of your hands, the tempo of your movement (e.g., two seconds up and then six seconds down), do partial reps (such as staying near the bottom position the entire time), etc. The other approach is to take up a complementary exercise for a while, such as pullups, and keep alternating when either one stagnates.<br><br>Needless to say, there are various schools of thought on the optimal method, and they can get quite dogmatic about it. For us weekend warriors, the bottom line is: when you get stuck, change something until you are unstuck.</div>

<div>I'm with Avrum.  I get terminally bored by repetition.  I tried doing planks some time ago, and physically I could do 45 secs easy, but mentally I would drop out as I didn't want to continue.  Maybe if I had a book to read while planking...</div>

If for example you lift a weight of 100 kilograms x 3 reps (=300 kilograms) along 15 minutes (1 every five minutes) you will probably be targeting the anaerobic mechanism. The muscle will react by increasing its mass in order to be able to respond to that stimulus. If, on the contrary, you lift 300 kilograms in 30 reps of 10 kilograms each along 15 minutes, you will probably be targetting the aerobic mechanism. The muscle won't grow nearly as much and rather than strength it will develope endurance.<br><br>That's why a marathon runner and a sprinter look so different, although they might be running the same distances in their training sessions. They run differently.<br><br>Of course there are other variations besides those, you may work on explossive strength or the best combination of aerobic and anaerobic for your distance if you are a runner.<br><br>But no, I don't think equal volume of weight lifted per unit time will give you the same results irrelevantly of the way in which you train. And one hundred pushups in one set or divided up in 5 sets are not the same. If you are able to perform 100 pushups in one set your muscles endurance is much better than if you can perform them only in several sets.</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Marcelo - 2011-06-21 21:45</div>
<div>The numbers in the example I gave are very irrealistic. Just to correct that: 3 reps x 100 kgs in 3 minutes (one each minute) against 100 reps x 3kgs in 3 minutes.</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Bernie - 2011-06-21 22:33</div>
<div>Marcelo,<br><br>As you say, we do not get identical results based purely on overall volume. The "secondary role" of sets & reps I referred to has to do with whether you are attempting to build muscle mass, maximal strength (1RM), or endurance (such as a boxer's ability to keep on punching round after round), and other finer tunings, such as adapting to your individual muscle fiber composition, as different people have differing amounts of TypeI/IIa/IIb fibers in various muscles. The point about volume is how *much* progress you can make in your chosen direction. I.e., if you are sad that you've only made 50 pushups today, you can generally make something like double your progress by doing another 50 after adequate rest—assuming of course that "adequate" fits into the remainder of today.<br><br>These (and other) variables account for why some people have little success with popular routines that work for countless others: if those routines prescribe a fixed progression of reps and sets, they may be designed for the fiber composition of the average individual, whereas if your fiber makeup is very different, then you would might need to, say, double the reps to get results.<br><br>A leading strength coach in the development and applications of such things is Charles Poliquin at <a href="http://www.charlespoliquin.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.charlespoliquin.com/</a> , who has great success applying them to Olympic athletes, professional hockey teams, and individuals who have a lot more money than me.<br><br>A few relevant articles:<br><br><a href="http://www.charlespoliquin.com/ArticlesMultimedia/Articles/Article/432/Rising_to_Pull-Up_Success.aspx" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.charlespoliquin.com/ArticlesMultimedia/Articles/Article/432/Rising_to_Pull-Up_Success.aspx</a><br><br><a href="http://www.charlespoliquin.com/ArticlesMultimedia/Articles/Article/289/Intensity_Brackets_for_Optimal_Training.aspx" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.charlespoliquin.com/ArticlesMultimedia/Articles/Article/289/Intensity_Brackets_for_Optimal_Training.aspx</a><br><br><a href="http://www.charlespoliquin.com/ArticlesMultimedia/Articles/Article/261/A_Look_Back_and_Ahead_at_German_Volume_Training.aspx" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.charlespoliquin.com/ArticlesMultimedia/Articles/Article/261/A_Look_Back_and_Ahead_at_German_Volume_Training.aspx</a><br><br><a href="http://www.charlespoliquin.com/ArticlesMultimedia/Articles/Article/221/Question_How_long_I_should_use_a_specific_workout_.aspx" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.charlespoliquin.com/ArticlesMultimedia/Articles/Article/221/Question_How_long_I_should_use_a_specific_workout_.aspx</a><br><br>As I was saying, there are other successful coaches who use other principles, and I'd like to stop short of arguing which school is correct. I just wanted to share these methods, because I've found them to be more reliable than most, giving more predictable results and more useful strategies for getting past sticking points—you know, when you are on month 5 of a routine, and it doesn't seem to work any more.<br><br>I'm also a sucker for anything that works while bucking the conventional wisdom. ;-><br><br>But if something else works for you, then I'll echo Mark Forster's advice (this was about SuperFocus variations, but I'm transplanting it here, and paraphrasing): if it is giving you the results you want, then don't feel obliged to change it.</div>

<div>I re-read the instructions for push ups Day 3 (starting on 3rd week) and I should have rested two minutes or more between sets. I rested 90 seconds, and that was my mistake.

<div>Agreed, Marcelo. 100 pushups in a row does not fit my goals either, but I didn't want to jump in here and second-guess other people's objectives. Everyone will benefit in the early days of 100 pushups, and then I suspect some will discover that they don't really want to do all 100, while others will push right ahead and conquer it for whatever reason is personally motivating them.<br><br><br>The only reason I got into that "volume" business was to reply to avrum who said:<br><br><< For me, once the novelty of an exercise program weans (particularly programs that require increased reps, leading to more of the same ol', same ol') , the actual exercises become physically harder to perform. Both a psychological and physical issue for me.>><br><br>Since this effect is universal, I thought it would help to share a strategy for breaking through the inevitable plateaus. Volume principles provide one such strategy.<br><br>A related thing to keep in mind is that if you are doing, say, 25 pushups and already bored to tears, it may be because you are not intuitively interested in the goal of building sheer endurance. In that case, you might want to try elevating your feet to make the pushup harder until you can barely manage five. From there, you can work all the way up to a one-arm pushup at very low reps. Bye-bye, boredom!</div>

<div>Mark:<br><br>1. Well done for Week 1, Day 2! Excellent!<br><br>2. Me, I've just completed Week 3 Day 3 for sit ups (I started at week 3 as indicated per my initial test).<br><br>Set 1: 33 of 33<br>Set 2: 42 of 42<br>Set 3: 30 of 30<br>Set 4: 30 of 30<br>Set 5: 45 of 45 (min)<br><br>3. I reflected on the previous discussion about "fitness" after your last comment, and understood how pointless it is. If someone's vision of "fitness" includes completing the 100 Pushup Challenge or standing half an hour on his head or whatever, then that's it, that's HIS/HER pulling vision. Even if from a more general perspective it may be argued that there are more efficient ways to achieve fitness, if the person dreams about doing 100 pushups - unless there is a real danger in it, which I don’t think there is - then that’s it. It is not about fitness, it is about one’s dreams.<br><br>4. I am not well versed or versed at all in the Dreams methods. I did read the book partially and superficially, to have an idea of what is it about, but did not attempt to practice the methods described in it. I think therefore a contribution of value I can make to this thread, is to provide a control case, that of someone pursuing the same goal (the 100 pushups) when it is not a compelling part of his own personal vision (fitness is a central part of my own personal vision but the 100 pushups challenge has only a tangential contribution to it) and does not follow the Dreams Methods - so that the value of the Dreams Methods can be better assessed.</div>

Competitive sports and health (I assume a sick person is not fit) do not go hand in hand. With a few exceptions like swimming, competitive sports have a varying but high risk of injury. Anyone who has been in competition long enough at a level in which the medal is important will be able tell you about his injuries, some of them remaining even many years after he quited the sport.<br><br>I admit that a person into recreational sports will be in better shape than a coach potato.

A 70-80 y/o British lady with a high level of "general fitness" for her culture, will most surely be unable to give a hand to these 70-80 y/o Japanese women ( <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxKPOH5AiXU&feature=related" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxKPOH5AiXU&feature=related</a> ). So what you call "general fitness" is in fact fitness for a specific environment/culture.<br><br>We can learn a lot about fitness, health, longevity and productivity from other cultures. "Recreational sports" are a need only in our cultural life-style, others spontaneously include enough physical activity in their way of life so that there is no need for such an artifice. Please watch the following video: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-jk9ni4XWk&feature=related" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-jk9ni4XWk&feature=related</a>  Dan Buettner and his brother carried out some serious investigations which are in You Tube as well. <br><br>As for push ups, which is the central subject in this thread, I found quite a few norms and averages that give more realistic values than 100 push ups. For your age, an excellent level of fitness in push ups varies from >18 to >30. The RAF requisites for age 50-54 are 11 push ups in one minute. For the aged 17-19 (higher lever) excellent varies from >39 to >56. The RAF requisites are 14 in a minute.

As my aim is excellency, not supermanhood, I will complete the program - I have another 3 weeks to go, as I started on the third week because of the results in my initial test - aiming at 40-50 push ups. That will place me by far in the excellency level for my age (between >19 to >31), and that's all I want. At the same time I will finish the sit ups which are going well too, and afterwards I will move into pull ups and some other exercise on alternate days, may be running, I don't know yet.<br><br>I know your are very committed to the 100 push ups, but I suggest you to consider this new information and set excellent but more realistic goals, otherwise you may get stuck with push ups for a long time and that's not good.

<div>Mark:<br><br>At the end of Week 2 there is another exhaustion test that will determine in which column you will continue in Week 3. So no, I wouldn’t take the test now but rather wait until the end of Week 2. What I would do is not to repeat Week1 entirely, this because you have already completed successfully W1 D1 and W1 D2, but repeat Week 1 Day 3 with longer breaks between sets. The pattern I see at your “failed” attempts (there are no failures here, you see how much  you have advanced) is that after the second set (the exhausting one, that’s the idea of the second set so that your muscles develop endurance) you are unable to complete the following sets. This is probably because your body has not yet taken away enough lactic acid from the muscles. So take longer breaks, try 3 minutes, even 4 if you need, and see what happens. You might also try moving your arms gently during the breaks, in a sort of huging yourself and opening them alternately, that accelerates the process of taking the lactic acid away.  Notice that the instructions say “﻿rest 120 seconds between each SET (longer if required)”. “Longer if required” applies here. Another point in the instructions: “﻿It's also important to be well hydrated before you start each workout.” Are you drinking enough before? Try these and let’s see what happens.<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Although I said I wouldn't go on with the theoretical discussion, I feel that I owe you a further effort to explain myself.<br><br><<So are you saying that a person with a high level of general fitness in London will be no better off than a couch potato also from London if they both go up into the high Andes?>><br><br>No, I don't know about that.

Usually, the populations that are most successful are those whose ancestors have lived at high altitudes for thousands of years."<br><br> What I am saying is that the person from London (unless he has ancestors from that region) will never be as fit as a local from the high altitude environment in that environment because there is a genetic factor involved:<br><br>"A recent study of Tibetan villagers who live their lives at around 15,000 feet has shown that they have 10 oxygen-processing genes not commonly found in lowland populations.  The EPAS1 gene is particularly important in adapting to environments with consistently low oxygen pressure." <br><br><<Living at a high altitude and being a pearl diver both strike me as being fitness for a specific situation, not general fitness. >><br><br>I think this is due to the perspective from which you are looking at things: you take your environment/culture as the "general" one and their environment/culture as a "specific situation". For them it might seem the opposite.<br><br>The quotes are from the same source I linked to before:<br><a href="http://anthro.palomar.edu/adapt/adapt_3.htm" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://anthro.palomar.edu/adapt/adapt_3.htm</a></div>

<div><<These are exceptions, not the rule. >><br><br>You are right in this. Yet it does not deny that fitness is specific for an environment, a culture, an activity, etc. Even if the majority of humanity lives at sea level, then what you call "general fitness" is so for sea level, not for every environment. It's like saying that water boils at 100 centigrades no matter what, which is incorrect, or saying that water boils at 100 centigrades in normal conditions (the athmospheric pression at sea level if I am not mistaken). It's just to long to say, but we know "100 centigrades" is not precise.<br><br>Look, I am also using right now, when trying to define "excellent fitness" as a goal I am pursuing, generalizations which are no precise and only relative. The tables I brought in a precedent post describe levels (low, average, good, excellent, whatever is written in them) for push ups, but those levels are not absolute, they result from statistics which are valid in western culture in the 21 century. Probably 1000 years ago or 1000 years from now they were/will be different, because the conditions in which people lived or will live were/will be different, using their body more or less. Quite probably if someone meassures what is the average for pull ups in a tribe that lives in trees in the Amazones the results will be very different from the average for people that live in cities in the first world, because the extent in which they use their muscles is different. So I know that when I am pursuing an excellent level for pull ups, "excellent" means in relation to the rest of the population that has been meassured, which translates into the population in the occidental world in the 21st century. That's OK because I want to be fit for my physical, social and cultural surroundings, I don't need to be fit to live in trees, but I don't delude myself thinking this is an absolute meassure representing the total capability for pull ups of humankind anywhere anytime.<br><br>So, I insist. Fitness is a relative concept.</div>

<div>Mark:<br><br>Still another idea you may want to try for the push ups program if longer breaks don't work or you already tried that, to avoid going back to stages you already completed: create  intermediate stages so that the progress will be more gradual. That would be:<br><br>Week 1 Day 2.1<br>Set 1: 7<br>Set 2: 9<br>Set 3: 7<br>Set 4: 7<br>Set 5: max (at least 9)<br><br>What do you think?</div>

<div>Thank you Seraphim :)<br><br>Rather than beating myself I am learning about a few things I need to improve. The main one is to *listen better to what other people are saying*.<br><br>I got entrenched in my positions about the concept of fitness being culturally dependent and the 100 pushups challenge not being the best approach to achieve fitness, and completely failed to hear what is Mark's main motive:  <<Bear in mind that most of the point of the 100 Pushup Challenge for me is to show how the Dreams methods can "keep one going during a project which requires consistent effort over a period.">> For his purpose, it is very convenient: simple, well structured, measurable and does demand a "consistent effort over a period".<br><br>On the positive side, I’ve got a very nice feedback for my English :)<br><br>I’ll stop reporting here about my daily routines, it is pointless, but I’ll keep an eye on Mark’s progress and report my exhaustion tests at the end of each completed “week” (there is one at the end of the fourth and fifth weeks, as well as the final test, although as soon as I’ll reach an excellent level for pushups and situps I’ll move on to the next routines - for my purpose it makes more sense).</div>

<div>I'm starting the challenge on Monday.  Did the initial test a couple of days ago and did 10.  That was about double my expectation of 5-6.  But I'm still a little sore.  Will have to see how my shoulders hold up.</div>

<div>To be honest any slight improvement each day is a great start. Trying something new like the '100 push ups' challenge will be difficult if you are not one who have upper body strength. My arm strength is poor so if I began this it would look as though my physical health is poor but the majority of my strength is in my legs and stomach. Ask me to do 100 sit ups I'd do great, ask me to do 100 push up no chance! I'll start off with light weights whilst I jog before I tackle my entire body weight! Interesting post though, keep it up!</div>

<div>Diane,<br><br>Another option is start with standing pushups. Stand in front of a wall with your feet about a foot from the base, and your hands on the wall at shoulder level, then do the push-up move. That way you can get more reps at less weight. Doing only one or two reps at too high a weight can stress the muscles too much. Also, you need to do several reps to activate and use all the fibers in the muscles. Ages ago, the therapist told Dad that 15 reps to total exhaustion was about right.</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Mark Forster - 2011-08-7 23:30</div>
<div>A simple and easy way to progress with push-ups if you don't have much arm strength to begin with is to start with standing push-ups as described by Cricket. Do two sets of as many as you can each day. Your aim is to work up to two sets of 20. When you've achieved that, increase the difficulty, e.g. by using a chair instead of the wall, and work up to two sets of 20 again.<br><br>Continue increasing the difficulty using the same method. Next might come push-ups on the floor from the knees only, then full-body push-ups, then raise your feet onto a chair, then you might even progress to such exotic beasts as push-ups clapping your hands at full-extension and one-armed push-ups!</div>

<div>Excellent exercise, you can use additionally the wide hands position push ups which really burns your chest and the diamond push ups (close hands position) for hard triceps workout!<br>My favorite is push-ups on ball and then Exercise Ball Pull-In burns chest.</div>
