<h1>Tiinker: Tailormade News Stories</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2008-01-21 18:33</div>
<div class="content"><p>Today I’ve been playing with a website <a href="http://www.tiinker.com/" target="_blank">Tiinker </a>which has been in Beta by invitation for some time but has just been released to the public. It aims to provide you with news articles which are tailored to your tastes. It doesn’t do this by asking you for the type of story you want, but by getting you to give its stories a thumbs up or a thumbs down. This way it learns what you like and what you don’t.</p><p><span class="full-image-float-none"><img style="width: 450px; height: 298px" alt="Tiinker_Page.jpg" src="/storage/Tiinker_Page.jpg"></span></p><p>The interface is simple and easy and I found after very little use that it was already getting to know me quite well. The quality of the stories seems quite high too. So I recommend it for anyone who wants to keep up with the world in general or any subjects in particular.</p><p>A word of warning: set yourself a time limit for using this site - it can be quite addictive. (Just as well I didn’t have anything very important to do today!)</p></div>
