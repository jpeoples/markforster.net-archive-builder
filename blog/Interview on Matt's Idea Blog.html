<h1>Interview on Matt's Idea Blog</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2006-11-17 17:30</div>
<div class="content"><p>There's a long write up of an interview with me by Matthew Cornell in <em>Matt's Idea Blog</em>: <a href="http://ideamatt.blogspot.com/2006/11/conversation-with-mark-forster.html" target="_blank">A Conversation with Mark Forster</a></p><p>Matt's a great interviewer and writer, and he has given me a chance to be a bit more wide ranging than I'm usually able to be in interviews. So if you want my ideas on a whole host of business and life subjects summed up very neatly, this is a good place to start.</p></div>

<div>Mark, I was introduced to you and your work by that Cornell blog entry.  <br><br>I have since looked over your web site articles and just today received your latest book! (...delivered by Royal Mail from Amazon.UK to me here in cold Minnesota, USA).  I look forward to reviewing and implementing.  <br><br>Your "I'll Just Get the File Out" trick has already reaped some benefits here.<br><br>Take Care, -DP</div>
