<div class="content"><p>I haven’t had a great deal of discretionary time today (and hardly any at all yesterday - what there was went on answering Comments), so there’s not much progress to report. However, as you’ll have seen, that hasn’t prevented me from publishing the latest in the Tips series and this Progress Report.</p></div>
