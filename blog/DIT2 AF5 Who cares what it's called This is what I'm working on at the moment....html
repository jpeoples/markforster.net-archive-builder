<h1>DIT2? AF5? Who cares what it's called? This is what I'm working on at the moment...</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2010-02-1 11:17</div>
<div class="content"><p><a href="http://www.snailrider.ru/archives/98">Russian Translation</a></p>
<p>Usually when I release a new time management system I have tested it quite thoroughly myself. This is important because often any drawbacks only become apparent quite a while down the line.</p>
<p>But in the case of the new DIT2/AF5 system, I think it might be more helpful to have other people working on it with me at the same time so that we can share our experiences of it together.</p>
<p>So what I am going to do now is to share the basic outline of what I’m doing now, so others can run with it and see what they can make of it. I’m not going to go into much detail because I think that would destroy the purpose of the exercise - the detail should appear from our experience of working the system.</p>
<p>This is what it consists of:</p>
<p>1. You need a page-a-day diary with plenty of lines. Also some form of bookmarking for today’s date and the two entry pages (see below) - though turned down page corners are probably quite sufficient.</p>
<p>2. All <em>new tasks</em> are entered on the page which is one calendar month from today’s date. Example: Today’s date is February 1st. New tasks are entered on the page for March 1st. Tomorrow I will enter new tasks on March 2nd and so on.</p>
<p>3. All <em>re-entered tasks</em> are entered on the page which is one week from today. So any task I re-enter today (Monday February 1st) goes on the page for for next Monday (February 8th). Tomorrow (Tuesday) they will go on the page for next Tuesday 9th and so on.</p>
<p>4. Nothing is ever entered on any page, other than the pages currently one month and one week from today’s date.</p>
<p>5. All active pages are treated as if they were one long list and you continue to circulate round them doing the tasks that stand out.</p>
<p>6. All tasks which are on pages earlier than today’s date have expired. They are dead, done for, dismissed, deceased.</p>
<p>The thinking behind this is that you can put anything you like into the system. If you do nothing about it, it will remain there for a month and then expire. If at any time you commit yourself to a task by taking some action on it, you are put under increased pressure to get it finished by being given only seven calendar days to do some more work on it. Of course many tasks are done in one go, so can be deleted without being re-entered.</p>
<p>That’s all you need to get started. </p></div>

<div>Hi Mark,<br><br>The second February in step 2, shoul that read March? <br><br>"2. All new tasks are entered on the page which is one calendar month from today’s date. Example: Today’s date is February 1st. New tasks are entered on the page for February 1st."</div>

<div>Its looks fascinating and I'm interested to hear how this works for people, but unfortunately I won't be joining in the testing for now. AF4 is working really for me at work and as we approach the end of our financial year I don't think it is the correct time to be changing systems. Maybe once April arrives things will be a bit calmer and I can try it then.</div>

<div>Well what a pleasant surprise.  Decided today to start a number of personal transformations with time management as usual on the long list.  Earlier this morning I was little disapointed that the eagerly awaited new system was going to be another month away so what a surprise to see mere hours later here it is.  And the bigger surprise was it was nothing like what I thought it would be like.  It is is going to be an interesting test and the forum will be buzzing with questions and tweaks.  <br>Thanks Mark for giving me another tool to experiment with<br>best regards</div>

<div>Let's assume we are yesterday, and not today...<br>It's January 31.  Where do I find February 31 to enter new task?  Do I take instead February 28 again (that way, I have to use February 28 for 4 consecutive days...)</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Mark Forster - 2010-02-1 12:54</div>
<div>Anne:<br><br>I didn't want to make things more complicated by mentioning that, but the answer is yes, continue to put use February 28 for four days. If it gets full then move on to the next day. When it gets down to the 1 week spot, then again the rule is that if the page is full you continue on the next page.</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Zylch - 2010-02-1 12:57</div>
<div>I was also thinking about Anne's comment, we should perhaps stick to 4 weeks instead of a calendar month?</div>

<div>This is very intriguing. I will have to adjust my thinking about a page-a-day "diary," rather than treating it as a "calendar." My first thought was that "Do it tomorrow" has become "Do it next month!" ~ Extreme procrastination. But then I realized that the dates are not treated as target action dates, but as expiration dates. I might try this...</div>

<div>I love Do it Tomorrow, it changed my life as it took stress out of my work, with incoming phone calls and me anticipating them and getting nervous. Enter the closed list. Making all the difference. It's good enough for me. Thanks a ton!</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Rich - 2010-02-1 13:16</div>
<div>So I guess you need two diaries - one for this system and one for genuine appointments and time-critical items?  Although I suppose you could use, say, the top half of each page for appointments and the bottom half for these auto-expiring 'do-them-when-they-feel-right' tasks.</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Joyce - 2010-02-1 13:17</div>
<div>So if I'm just starting in this daily diary and my current list doesn't all fit on the page that is one month from today it sounds like I would continue writing on the next page which is one month plus one day from today. Now that I've written this down it seems so obvious that it's silly to post but I'll go ahead in case anyone else thinks like me.</div>

<div>Intriguing. And a bit confusing. So I better give it an IRL-test (that's In Real Life, not in Ireland ;-)<br><br>One question, if putting things one month/week ahead of time has more to do with creating auto-timed dismissal than having to do with the calendar - then I could use last years left over (empty) one day a page diary. If I'm not concerned with actually using the task diary as an calendar as well?<br><br>Excited to start testig out DIT2/AF5/FLOW/AFD/WHATEVER ;-)<br><br>/jonaz</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Lenore - 2010-02-1 13:24</div>
<div>Thanks for sharing your thinking early, Mark!  I love this idea so far.  It fits in with something I was contemplating regarding my school assignments.  I was thinking it might be best with those to put them on the day they're due, often a week off.  This is kind of the same thing, but generalized to tasks without due dates as well.  <br><br>On the idea of assignments and other tasks with due dates, any comments on how best to handle them?  If I enter them a month off when they're really due on a date that's closer, that doesn't feel right.  But If I enter them on their actual due date, then I wouldn't be working on that page until either a month or a week from when the task is due.</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Jonaz in Stockholm - 2010-02-1 13:28</div>
<div>One clarification; putting tasks on a date one month/week from today has nothing to do with when we actually DO them? Pages are used as a long list (with dates as "page numbers").<br><br>The dates on the pages are only involved in the dismissal procedure.<br><br>So it's not a "Do It Next Month"-system ;-)<br><br>/jonaz</div>

<div><< So it's not a "Do It Next Month"-system ;-) >><br><br>Jonaz - I'm totally confused. Here's a real example. <br><br>I receive voice message from a potential client inquiring about my service. According to the rules. I write "Call back client X" one calendar month from today’s date. <br><br>So when do i call back client X? <br>Also, if you start the system fresh, all of your tasks are written one month from today. Do just choose a few things to work on and put them into todays date? How many do you choose. <br><br>It's quite clear I'm missing some essential detail.</div>

<div>I´m very happy to find some new ideas concerning DIT as I changed back from AF to DIT after giving AF a try for several weeks.<br><br>What I read now seems very motivating to me - a perfect mixture of the best of both Systems.<br><br>Thank you very much, Mark for publishing so much input again and again...<br><br>Just beginning to think about DIT I´m wondering, if it makes sense to mark tasks that are re-entered (will expire in 1 week). Perhaps write them down in another color or whatever... What do you think?....</div>

<div>Sorry for raining on Mark's parade, but isn't this effectively a To Do List - albeit self deleting, the very essence of what DIT strove to take us away from?!?!</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Pete A - 2010-02-1 13:51</div>
<div>Mark,<br>Does it matter which end of the list you start from? In AF1 you always start from the earliest; in AF2 you always start from the latest; in DIT it doesn't matter. Do you think it matters with this model?</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Jonaz in Stockholm - 2010-02-1 14:05</div>
<div>Avrum, as I've got it (or think I have...) you would put the task of calling back in the page with the date one month from now. Then you work the pages with tasks on them just like you would an AF-list (I think...) Ignore the dates. Consider them just as page numbers.<br><br>You use the dates on the diary pages only when you put a new task on the list, and also for dismissal (when you come to that date in real life those tasks are dismissed).<br><br>I'm sure Mark would be able to explain better, I might have gotten it all wrong. But I think that that date one month ahead has nothing to do with when you *do* the task. It just a matter of introducing a "self-dismissing" system.<br><br>/jonaz</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Tijl Kindt - 2010-02-1 14:07</div>
<div>Ok, at first I thought this new system was pretty lame. But then thinking on it a bit further, I started kinda liking it. Let me see if I get this right... So basically you're doing the following:<br><br>Paper version:<br>* get yourself a bunch of paper sheets<br>* put on each piece of paper: "expires on MM/DD/YY", going from today to whenever<br>* add tasks on the pieces of paper that expires 1 month from now (new tasks) or 1 week from now (re-entered tasks)<br>* treat all 'future' pages between now and 1 month from now as one big active list to circle around as you do tasks that stand out to you.<br><br>Digital version (actually much simpler!):<br>Porting this to a digital world, what you basically have is one long list of tasks, sorted by expiration date of the task, where the expiration date is determined by when you added (a month earlier) or re-entered (a week earlier) the task. You circle around the list doing tasks that stand out, and every day the top portion of your list expires... right? I'm imagining tasks could be color-coded by expiration date (expiring today = reddish, expiring less than a week from now = yellowish, expiring later than that = greenish).<br><br>Digital version summarized:<br>* one long list of tasks, sorted by expiration date<br>* expiration date = 1 week from now (re-entered task) -or- 1 month from now (new task)<br>* circle the list and do tasks that stand out<br>* tasks that have expired are gone forever<br><br>Questions:<br><br>1) What do you do when you go on vacation, are in the hospital or "quit" AF5/DIT2 for two weeks? What do you do with all the tasks that have "expired" unconciously? In AutoFocus, a task never expires if you don't specifically let it expire.<br><br>2) Can I re-enter a task without actually doing anything with it? (as when you reviewed a task in AF4 and decided to add it to the list again). Or am I not allowed to re-enter a task unless I actually did something with it?<br><br>3) Related to the previous question... I imagine that this system will more actively force me to "review" tasks that have been on the list for too long, by forcing the tasks to expire if I don't do anything with it, and decreasing the window of opportunity once I commit. If I then decide to split the task in several pieces, I imagine I should then consider myself comitted and enter all of those as re-entered tasks?<br><br>4) I guess one way to tweak this new system somewhat more towards AF4 would be to consider the first 7 pages (or expiration dates) as the closed list, and everything after that the open list, so that you circle in the closed list until nothing stands out and then go to the open list once and then back to the closed list. Or is that a bad idea? In fact, maybe you could have 3 "levels" of lists, the "expires today" list, the "expires this week" list, and the "expires this month" list. You circle the today list until nothing stands out, then you go to the week list and go back to the today list after every circle, until nothing stands out in either of them, then you go to the month list, etc. Just like with AF, but in three levels instead of one.<br><br>Those were my thoughts so far :).<br>Cheers,<br>Tijl</div>

<div>Jonaz... <br><br>So if I'm starting fresh, all of the things I'd like to do today are entered ONE MONTH FROM TODAY'S DATE. Essentially, I'd have 30+ pages blank, and then one page full of tasks. I'd start working from March 1 (a la AF), and renter tasks/projects that need more work, ONE WEEK FROM TODAYS DATE. <br><br>Does this sound correct?</div>

<div>Mark, <br><br>I hate to rain on a parade as glorious as yours but I think you are adrift. The key concept in "autofocus" is to let your subconscious pick the time to tackle the next task. You do this by scanning and picking from the list. The challenge is how to balance the "old" vs the "new". Some of the aging items may never happen (at least as written), perhaps because they were poorly conceived, improperly stated, or simply not actually important. The "new" tasks have "pseudo-imperative" of the "now" but some will surely prove to age poorly. That is why they must wait their time a bit. [As always, the truly urgent, the must happen now, simply cut to the front of the line -- that is the real world.]<br><br>To my mind, AF4 is at the sweet spot. Simple, unidirectional, with a clear way to ultimately prune the deadwood tasks. One can argue about how and when to cross the line or draw the next line, but that is small stuff. Tying the pruning system to calendars or fixed intervals loses all the abstraction that makes the system flexible and adaptable to different styles and contexts. <br><br>For myself, the next challenge in AF is how to read those internal subconscious clues better, how to bring some rationale into play without interfering with the glorious spontaneous subjectivity of the approach. <br><br>Beware of tinkering in response to minor issues or for the fun of playing with something new. <br><br>Thanks for all your stimulating efforts, <br><br>bob</div>

<div>I'm going to give this a try, with great exuberance. My Franklin Covey pages, which I just adore, are perfect for this system. Several people have said, <br>"What about real-life appointments" like doctor's appt on March 3. Well, the Covey pages I use have a two page spread -- one side is for appointments and the other side is a "Daily record of events". So I'll use the daily record for the list and I can still look through those right-side pages, ignoring the date while I work on getting them done, and use the left-side pages to track appointments. Cool! <br><br>I'm anxious to check back in a couple of days. (Or, the way my day looks so far, maybe this evening.) (grin)<br>-Allison</div>

<div>And one more silly comment... I just love that this new idea was posted on the very day I RAN OUT of notebooks (gasp!) and needed to go buy another one today. <br><br>I like the digital idea, and that does seem easier, but somehow a paper and pencil has a kick for me.<br><br>-Allison</div>

<div>I'm unconvinced that this latest incarnation solves the challenges mentioned in  "DIT2 Progress Report" any better than Autofocus v.4 does.<br><br>My opinion (without actually trying this new approach) is that it adds complexity (e.g. 1 week/1 month/up to 30 active pages) without perceived benefit (i.e. unrewarded complexity).<br><br>At this early stage (and I understand it's very early), I don't plan to test this version as it is.  I was interested in something closer to DIT, so I guess it's either AF4 or DIT for me.  Luckily, there are a lot of choices to pick from.</div>

<div>So far, Mark hasn't explained the process of working through the list, but I love how this is a way to manage one's Master To-Do List and keep it current. I suppose one could use this idea, and use whatever method works for pulling items off the list to work on. I'm not going to worry about that right now.<br><br>Just thought I'd share how I have set mine up. I decided I needed a looseleaf system, because I don't want to carry around a 365-page book. I will add pages and take out pages once a week.<br><br>I put a bunch of sheets of 8 1/2 x 5 1/2 into a "report cover" type binder. I labeled the first page "Expires Feb. 8 Monday," and each subsequent page similarly. Also on the first page, I wrote "Reentered Feb. 1" ~ and the following pages likewise.<br><br>Beginning on the "Expires Mar 1 Monday" page, I wrote "Entered Feb 1 Monday" and the following pages similarly.<br><br>This solves the February 28 pileup. I am using 7 days for the Reenter interval, and 28 days for the Enter interval.<br><br>So the first page is labeled:<br>Exp. 2/8 Mon<br>R. 2/1<br><br>The last page is labeled:<br>Exp. 4/12 Mon<br>Ent. 3/15<br>R. 4/5<br><br>I will use 3 plastic tabs to mark Today's expiration page, Entry page, and Reentry page.<br><br>I will probably use something like a "Do It Tomorrow" procedure with a separate calendar to actually use this list, until and unless Mark comes out with some other guidelines. I think it will work great! I'm very excited about it. <br><br>Thanks, Mark!<br><br>~Sarah J</div>

<div>Hmmm.<br><br>I can see some potential, but mostly this just looks like autofocus with expiration dates. I'll keep checking to see if anyone's comments on using it impress, but I can see the following happening quite easily:<br><br>1 - resistant task goes in a month from now (i.e. currently March 1st). I don't do anything until that day on it (because I'm resisting it)<br>2 - Towards the end of March 1st, it dawns on me that it's about to get dismissed, but I don't actually want to lose it, as I generally resist dismissal. The solution is to do a little work on the item, and move it forward a week<br>3 - Same occurs the next week, and the week after, and ...<br><br>... Eventually my list is cluttered with items I keep doing 5-10 minutes on every week or so, all at least 1 month old. Eventually I will let some get dismissed, but in the above example I think it would have gone much quicker under AF<br><br>I'm also a bit worried about how, in AF, I generally had a good overview of everything on the list - I'm not sure it will be so easy in this system.</div>

If you enter something on the page for March 1st, then it expires on March 1st. You may do it any time between now and then. The easiest way to enter something with a specific date is either to use a reminder system (like Outlook Tasks) or enter on the list with the date you want to do it in brackets, e.g. "Call Bob (Mar 10)"</div>

<div>Looking at Leon's response at 14:51, my understanding is that eventually there will approx 30 active lists, not three, although today there are only two 8th Feb and 1st March, and we keeping adding 2 lists a day until the maximum is reached in a months time.</div>

<div>One thing that occurs to me is that this system could potentially accommodate tasks that you know are going to be important at some point, but aren't important now.<br><br>My situation is that mental health issues mean that sometimes I am simply not capable of coping with very long lists and need to keep the present very short and simple. My head is buzzing with a whole lot of things I would like to do or feel I have to do, which means a very long list, which leads to anxiety and confusion. The flip side of that is that leaving them out altogether also leads to anxiety if I don't find a good system for recording them somewhere else for retrieval later. Putting something down for expiry in 7 months time, means that I can forget about it for the next 6 months.<br><br>Concrete example: I have had a substantial art project in mind for quite a few years. However my present reality is that I am dealing with  joblessness, poor health etc. If I put the art project for expiry in 4 months, I can "forget about it" for 3 months while I get on with other stuff, including more modest art-related activities. Of course it ends up immediately on the subconscious list, meanwhile the conscious list becomes shorter and more feasible.<br><br>At the moment to be honest, I find autofocus too much of a hurdle. Very short daily to-do lists of a few key tasks are sometimes as much as I can manage. Once autofocus has broken down it is hard for me to get it rolling again. I'm interested in this new system, but I won't be rushing into it unless I can find a way to continue engaging with it even during those times when my psychological resources are very limited.</div>

<div>Thanks Tilj for the flowchart. It points out the question I have, what do you do when a task is complete and is recurring? Add it 30 days from today, or 7? I am thiniking of daily recurring tasks and I am fighting my inclination to just add them to tomorrow's date. :)</div>

<div>Tijl:<br><br>Your summary of the "electronic version" of the system is correct.<br><br>Questions:<br><br>1) What do you do when you go on vacation, are in the hospital or "quit" AF5/DIT2 for two weeks? What do you do with all the tasks that have "expired" unconciously? In AutoFocus, a task never expires if you don't specifically let it expire.<br><br>This is one of the complications which I am trying to keep out of the initial version so that people could experiment and see what works. The answer I myself am experimenting with is that you cross out all the days between the last 1-month page you put tasks on and the current 1-month page. Then you renumber the first day you missed to today's date, and the similarly renumber the 1-week page, then each day renumber the next pages until you catch up. That's much harder to explain in words than it actually is in practice! For example if you are away for the next 2 days (Feb 2 and 3), when you come back 1) delete Mar 2 and 3, renumber Feb 2 to Feb 4 and Feb 8 to Feb 10..<br><br>2) Can I re-enter a task without actually doing anything with it? (as when you reviewed a task in AF4 and decided to add it to the list again). Or am I not allowed to re-enter a task unless I actually did something with it?<br><br>I wouldn't advise it. You will undermine the entire rationale of the system.<br><br>3) Related to the previous question... I imagine that this system will more actively force me to "review" tasks that have been on the list for too long, by forcing the tasks to expire if I don't do anything with it, and decreasing the window of opportunity once I commit. If I then decide to split the task in several pieces, I imagine I should then consider myself comitted and enter all of those as re-entered tasks?<br><br>That would be my reaction too, but it's worth experimenting with.<br><br>4) I guess one way to tweak this new system somewhat more towards AF4 would be to consider the first 7 pages (or expiration dates) as the closed list, and everything after that the open list, so that you circle in the closed list until nothing stands out and then go to the open list once and then back to the closed list. Or is that a bad idea? In fact, maybe you could have 3 "levels" of lists, the "expires today" list, the "expires this week" list, and the "expires this month" list. You circle the today list until nothing stands out, then you go to the week list and go back to the today list after every circle, until nothing stands out in either of them, then you go to the month list, etc. Just like with AF, but in three levels instead of one.<br><br>I did actually try this out and all it did was quite seriously get in the way!</div>

Thinking of tasks in this way takes some getting used to.  Let me see if I can explain my question better now that I've thought about it in that light.  Sorry in advance for the length.<br><br>I can see how this works for tasks that have no due date.  But my school assignments are due on x date, and so they actually "expire" on that date.  In a way it seems logical to simply enter them there.  But then when I work on them, I reenter them  7 days from now, which in effect changes the expiry date.  At first I hoped that your new system would preserve the natural urgency level of my assignments and allow me to track due dates at the same time.  Now I can see it won't work quite the way I had thought, and I would have to keep a separate listing of assignments with their due dates.<br><br>Also, I might find it difficult to trust the system if I'm  entering a task with a different expiry date than its inherent one.  Say, for example, if my reading assignment is due on February 6th but I enter it on March 1st because it's a month from now, it feels like there's more time to get to it than there is.  I'll have to see how this works out in practice.</div>

<div>Wicked pissa!  I'm excited to try this.  It seems like each person might want their own dials & settings to vary the periods -- perhaps even changing them from time to time.  If I'm overwhelmed, perhaps the new-entry day is 6 weeks away.  Or if I'm really cooking, 2 weeks.  And other variations that keep the spirit of the system but allow it to work across a wide variety of situations.  Oooooh, excited.</div>

<div>I think what is throwing people is having a separate page for each day, which makes the list feel more like a calendar than one long list. Also, for me, not seeing all of the tasks on one page makes it harder to keep in mind what tasks I am choosing between b/c I can't glance down the whole list. If I flip to a page and see 10 tasks, I'm automatically inclined to think that I need to choose between those 10, and it feels odd to just turn the page.<br><br>Mark, what about keeping it as one long list, but just writing expiry dates next to each task? As you process each item, you would look to see if it expired that day, if so cross it off, if not, consider whether to work on it, etc. When you work on it, if you need to re-enter it, you cross it off and re-enter at the bottom of the list with a new expiry date.<br><br>This would make it easier to think of the list as one where your instinct can guide your actions.</div>

<div>Marks new system is indeed very good, but instead of using a calendar I use a big notebook with consecutively numbered pages. Each morning I write the actual date on top of the next page without a date. <br>Example: If page 17 has todays date "Monday 2010-02-01", I write recurring tasks on page 24 (=17 + 7) and new tasks on page 47 (= 17 + 30).<br>Tomorrow morning I write "Tuesday 2010-02-02" on page 18 (the next page without a date), recurring tasks go to page 25 and new tasks to page 48.<br>The clou is: If I miss one or several days (vacation, hospital, major desaster... ;-)) I can start the next day after that with the next page. Example: If I miss 2010-02-03 to 2010-02-10, I will write "Thursday 2010-02-11" on top of page 19, without having to renumber any pages.<br>This even takes care of the 28. February problem: New tasks always go 30 pages from now, a real date won't be assigned to the page until it becomes my "today-page".<br><br>Mark, what do you think about that?</div>

<div>Ken,<br>In a digital task manager, you could do this no problem by simply sorting the list after every addition.

If you are a student who has regularly scheduled HW, especially if it is every day or week, and you do not regularly make it through your list, you would have to do something different. One solution might be to keep a separate HW calendar and simply add "Do Homework" in AF5/DIT2." This entry would quickly end up no more than seven days in the future and would be re-added nearly every day. Of course, the seven days in the future is not when I would work on the assignment. It just places it on the list nearer the "top". I do not like to keep such a large list of stuff that I cannot easily make it through the list every day.</div>

<div>DIT2 uses AF way to reduce resistance: while in DIT you HAVE to do all today's task and therefore each task get some resistance added, in DIT2 you HAVE to do only tasks that expire today, so DIT2 generates less resistance. That's great!<br><br>There is another strong motivational tool in AF, namely group dismissal: if one don't do a due task now, one have to dismiss not only this task, but the the whole group of due tasks. So one's incentive to act ("now or never") is mulitplied by the number of tasks. Is there any way to incorporate this powerful tool into DIT2?</div>

<div>Several people have raised the question of using one long list rather than a calendar/diary. I'm sure it is possible to do it this way, but my feeling is that the calendar/diary gives a powerful visual presentation which is missing in a list. Having been working on this system for three days now I am becoming more and more aware of just how powerful this is.</div>

<div>How is this any different than taking my AF list and changing all the dates to one month forward?  Right now I have 5 pages with the earliest task being from 3 weeks ago.  If I just change that date to 30 days ahead, then it would be expiring in one week.   <br><br>Couldn't you just do this by expiring AF items that are 30 days old or is there some benefit from post-dating them?</div>

<div>Henrik - new tasks get a 30 day "evaluation period", but once you have committed to a task (ie started working on it) you have to touch base at least once a weekend to keep that task "alive".<br><br>I'm going to get sooo much stuff done! (Or dismissed ;-)<br><br>/Jonaz</div>

<div>@Henrik E.: yes, that is what you're supposed to do. By committing yourself to a task (i.e. starting with it), you give yourself 7 days to work on it again, whether the original expiration date was less or more than 7 days away. Mark confirmed this somewhere in this thread or on the forum, I don't remember where.</div>

It oughtn't to, but if you're as bad a procrastinator as I am, I can see this happening.<br><br>Nevertheless, I want to give this system a try.  One of the problems I've had with trying to get AF to work for me over the last year has been that I don't dismiss as I should do - I'm not firm enough with myself.  The dismissal system with this new version might work for me better.<br><br>On the other hand, another problem I've had with AF is that if the list is too long (and I mean by that a lot shorter than the lists that some of you have) I don't know what's on it.  In my working day I have very little discretionary time, and it comes in short bursts.  So I rarely get through the list on one day.  I feel I need a short list of what I could do today or have to do, that I can look at quickly when I have a period of time to do a task or two.  I've tried to mimic that by going through the list at the start of the day and putting an asterisk next to the taks that I want to try to do that day.  The problem for me with this new system willl probably be that the list is going to be quite long.<br><br>I can see the psychological advantages of the various systems that Mark has developed, and am hoping that I can make one of them work for me.  It's good to have these different ways of working the list, given the differences in our personailities and working circumstances.  Thank you, Mark!</div>

<div>This is an interesting system, but I am sticking with DIT, nevertheless. AF was fine but didn't work for me and I feel this new system has similar disadvantages.<br><br>First, the completion of the day. This has been probably the greatest thing in the DIT. Knowing that you are done for the day which is relieving, as I don't have fixed end times. Also there is the incentive of trying to complete the day's work, which also makes me to do something on my tasks every day (little and often).<br><br>Second, autofocus dispersed my attention to too many things. I was working on too many things little and often, not getting things ready. If I now put all my things on one big list and doing something on them gives me always six (or four if you count out weekends) days when I do not have to work on them instead of doing something everyday, I feel it means it will longer to complete projects and increases the threat of having too many projects going on at the same time.<br><br>Perhaps, if I was self-employed I would give it a go. AF and this new system are better tuned to those who have more control on the contents of their work.</div>

<div>I've only just started this system, but here are my current thoughts on it:<br><br>When I write a new task in the diary, it's with the understanding that I'll do it or start it within the month. This limits over-committing. I think before I leap. I put down larger items rather than the minutae. I winnow out the "wish list" and only include what I think I can commit to.<br><br>Great!</div>

<div>I'm beginning to see the benefits - but I don't think I'm quite ready to abandon my AF list until I'm a touch less busy!<br><br>My personal suggestion to modify the rules would be to change the '1 month in advance' to '4 weeks (28 days) in advance'. It seems to me that might be easier for those of us that need to combine 'work' and 'home' tasks. That way, if I do need to save a task from the dismissal deadline on a Saturday or Sunday, it will be something that has been added on a previous weekend (either a week or a month previously) so is more likely to be something 'home-related'. Same for mid-week; tasks are generally more likely to be things I've been working on at work. This also solves the 'short months' issue.</div>

<div>Will, You say, "I've stuck dates on my AF list: let's see how it goes. (I can always ignore the due dates if it doesn't work out.)"<br><br>One of the things that AF5 does, if I am reading the instructions right, is that it rearranges the list automatically. Items that you are working on or are repetitive in nature, end up towards the top of the list. If you are merely adding due dates to an old AF list, you seem to be circumventing this.  If you have an item dated March 2, somewhere near the bottom of your current list and you start on it, you are supposed to re-enter the item and give it a new due date of, let's say, February 9. In AF 5, this will place the item somewhere near the top of the list (or nearer the beginning of your day notebook). In your old AF list, with added due dates, where would you enter it? If I am reading you correctly, you would add it to the bottom of end of the list? Or are you using a digital method (which is what I am doing.) Just wondering.</div>

<div>Hi Mark, <br><br>Many thanks for this new idea which looks very promising. I am, however, slightly confused about how you deal with repetitive tasks. For example, if you decide to check/process your e-mail in batches twice a day, how do you enter this in your list? Do you just write 'E-mail' in your list for 3 March twice, do it, then re-enter it on 10 February? Do you still use the 'current intiative' idea with this new system? If so, do you just write it in at the top of every page?</div>

You don't need to write it down twice.<br><br><< Do you still use the 'current intiative' idea with this new system?

<div>If a task recurs frequently, putting it next week works, even if you are doing it much sooner.  Just keep reentering it for next week.  Anything with a period of 7 days or less works with this.  If it has a recurs more than 7 days from now you'll be stuck with a task you can't work on because its time hasn't arrived.  <br><br>You could enter it as a new task on next month if its period is less than a month.  Anything less frequent needs a regular calendar.</div>

There is an element of confidentiality about my work.  Therefore I am seriously thinking about getting two diaries, one for home, one for work; then I can leave the work one locked up there.  Otherwise I would have to write all the work tasks in code (!) or put them down in a deliberately vague way, either of which I think would contradict one of the main features of the system.  I know this seems like a break away from DWM but I am happy to think of all the pages as one list, just automatically edited for context and opportunity ... <br><br>I adore stationery shopping anyway - and they have diary sales on at the moment  ...</div>

<div>I use microsoft outlook and think this system would work well with it. Simply create a "task" with the start date as the current date and a completion date for 30 or 7 days out.<br>Tasks are visable from the calendar as well as alone.<br><br><br>Just a thought.</div>

<div>Mark: <br><br><< It's important to realise that the dates are the expiry dates, not the dates you are planning to do them. If you enter something on the page for March 1st, then it expires on March 1st. You may do it any time between now and then. >><br><br>It occurs to me that, based on the expiry date, there may occasionally be justification for entering a task on a date other than the one-month or one-week interval. I'm quite comfortable with the idea that if a report I am writing is due in one week, i.e. on 16 Feb, it will be first entered on the page for 9 March. If I fail to complete it by 16 Feb I will continue to work on it on 17 Feb and submit it late. However, a task "Prepare for meeting on 16 Feb" has not only a due date of 16 Feb but also expires on the same day since, if I fail to complete it, there will be no point in working on it on or after 17 Feb. Entering this task on 16 Feb seems to fit with the ethos of the system, although the expiry date is intrinsic to the task rather than imposed by the system. Does this make sense?</div>

<div>Hello to all.<br><br>Maybe someone can help me with this: <br><br>I'm an extremely bad procrastinator. I mean really heavy and extreme, almost like a sickness. It happened after a big bankruptcy of my business. I'm still self employed. But I get really nothing done month after month (except all the unimportant tasks which I do really often).<br><br>My question for help is: Could someone recommend me what to do? I mean what kind of tool would you recommend? AF4 or AF5 or something completely different (Yes, I know "A Fool With a Tool Is Still a Fool")?<br><br>Every comment or recommendation is appreciated.<br><br>Thanks and sorry for my bad english,<br><br>Karl</div>

<div>Karl:<br><br>From what you say, I suggest that you try DWM (previously known as DIT2/AF5) together with the Current Initiative Option mentioned in my latest blog post.  I wouldn't advise you to use the other option mentioned "The Next Pass Mark Up" at this stage.<br><br><a href="../blog/DIT2 AF5 Who cares what it's called This is what I'm working on at the moment....html" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2010/2/1/dit2-af5-who-cares-what-its-called-this-is-what-im-working-o.html</a><br><br><a href="../blog/A couple of options for DWM.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2010/2/10/a-couple-of-options-for-dwm.html</a></div>

<div>Just a thought on the name. DWN seems useful for "internal testing," but it is not very enticing to the outsider. I know there was a thread on new names, but nothing seems to have stuck. I love the new system and wish I had a snappy moniker to use when I try to tell someone about it!</div>

<div>I am trying to switch over from AF4 to DWM. <br><br>So, my active lists are the one-week-from-now page and the one-month-from-now page. Correct? Which one should i autofocus on 1st? the former or latter?<br><br>Question to all - do i need to get a diary or has anyone made it work with the current AF4 ruled notebook?<br><br>Thanks.</div>

<div>I like this system with its two-pass filtering on what you actually care enough about to actually enaction. Anyway, I'm thinking that it could be implemented in something like GTD's 42 folders idea. Just put paper relating to what occurs to you to do in the folder for today's month-date, which is now behind next month. Look through the folders for things worth doing now. If you do something on a project, move its paper to 1 week from today. At the start of each day (or end of previous day) just dump its content into the expired (rubbish) bin.<br>Note that I'm using the folders like DWM, not like GTD: today's folder will contain stuff you are going to forget for good, NOT stuff you didn't want to remember until today.</div>

<div>Actually, it just occurred to me after posting that last post that may not everyone reading this list is familiar with the 42 folders idea. So here's the details of the version adapted for DWM called '31 folders'.<br>(a) label 31 manila folders with 'Day 01', 'Day 02', and so on,<br>(b) order these with tomorrow's date on top, through to 'Day 31', then 'Day 01' through to today's date on the bottom,<br>(c) when something occurs to you to do (first entry), add its paperwork (eg. the bill to be paid, or a note describing the task) to the folder corresponding to today's date,<br>(d) go through the contents of the folders looking for actions to take now,<br>(e) if you work on something but don't complete it, move it's paperwork to 7 days from today (second entry),<br>(f) at the start of each day, its folder will be on the top of your pile; empty its contents into your 'expired' bin, and replace the folder at the bottom of the pile.<br>The advantage of this system over the diary is that it's easier to include external paperwork (bills to pay, forms to fill in, birthday cards to send, papers to read, etc). Also, you can use per-project sheets, on which you track progress on individual projects.<br><br>What do you think?</div>

<div>@MarkE  (February 26, 2010 at 2:49):  That's an extremely clever idea! I'm now wishing that I hadn't bought a diary. :)  I especially like that you could use scrap paper in your folders (one-sided print-outs that you no longer need; letters that you don't need to keep...) to slightly reduce your environmental impact. Also your "capture" system when you're out and about can be just a small, folded pile of blank papers - no need to carry your entire, precious todo list with you and risk loosing it!</div>

<div>@MarkE - your 31 folders explanation gave me a lot of answers on my previous comments (right before yours). Thanks.<br><br>So I get that AF is very different from DWM as it is more closer in process to DIT. However the review process from AF is built into it for the daily tasks we work on. Right Mark?</div>

<div>Karl,<br><br>Sorry: I haven't been paying attention to blog comments since Andreas coloured in the forum so prettily.<br><br>For procrastination, Mark has contributed one huge idea: lie to your "inner lizard". Don't admit that you are going to sort out your finances: just decide to find a bank statement (or, if this is too much, open the file/ flick through the pile of papers). For a few years now I've been standing over my teenage boys while they put one foot on the floor, as the idea of getting up is just too, too scary for them. <br><br>I remember a successful Chartered Accountant in the UK telling a conference that this had made a big difference to him, and it certainly works for me.</div>

<div>I love this new system.  I find that it motivates me to get things done before the expiry day, or usually ON the expiry day.  I tend to be quite productive those days where I have quite a few items on the list to be done or postponed/deleted.<br><br>Anything that expires expires and I have to accept that I don't have the motivation to do it.  But sometimes and item will stay in my mind and a few days later if I feel an urge to not let it go and actually get around to doing it, then I do it, even though it's not on any active list for me anymore.<br><br>I'm impressed.  This works better for me than the AF methods have done.  Thank you for sharing and letting us test it for ourselves.</div>

<div>For me, the closed list is too functional to be given up. I think if I adopted this new system I would follow the following strategy: <br><br>Each morning, I would cycle through all active pages to create a closed list for the day, consisting of a reasonable amount of tasks that stood out to me. I would commit to dismissing any task that was expiring today if it didn't make the cut to my closed list. The closed list would be small or large, depending on the level of other commitments I had that day (e.g. scheduled appointments and meetings). This process would essentially be my current initiative for the day. This new closed list would become my list for the day. Following the DIT method, I would proceed to check email, voicemail, and paper before proceeding to this closed list. Accordingly, a same-day task would be listed under a drawn line at the bottom of my closed list. Any task that wasn't immediate or same-day would be put down a month from today's date as per the new system. Tasks that were recurring or which I did not complete would be put down a week from today's date. Finally, I'd conclude with my daily tasks. <br><br>I think this would allow me to be able to maintain a sense of the end of my day, and keep myself from spending too much time "trolling" my 30-day-long list every time I finished a task, which I think is a danger with the new system.</div>

<div>Anon123,<br><br>Your comment above is very interesting to me. I saw it soon after posting "Where to start working the DWM list?" in the forum. <br><br>I've been using my calendar for everything that's time-sensitive, DIT for work, and a bloated DWM list for everything else. I've contemplated abandoning DWM in favour of using DIT for everything, but I'm not quite at that point yet.<br><br>Please let us know how you get on with your version of DWM.<br><br>Chris</div>

<div>Everything up to D+month-1 is a single closed but live list. All the new items go on D+month.</div>
