<h1>High Volume, High Speed, Low Resistance - Final Test Result</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2017-07-17 20:32</div>
<div class="content"><p>I think I’ve proved to myself that <a href="../blog/High Volume, High Speed, Low Resistance - 5.html">this method</a> really does work.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that I was trying to find a way of processing a “catch-all” list without ending up with a huge number of tasks spread over many pages of notebook.</p>
<p>Well, have look at these results after nine days of using my new method.</p>
<p>The first column is the page number, and the second is the number of tasks remaining on that page. There are 31 tasks to the page. </p>
<p>1 - 0</p>
<p>2 - 0</p>
<p>3 - 0</p>
<p>4 - 0</p>
<p>5 - 0</p>
<p>6 - 0</p>
<p>7 - 0</p>
<p>8 - 0</p>
<p>9 - 0</p>
<p>10 - 0</p>
<p>11 - 0</p>
<p>12 - 0</p>
<p>13 - 0</p>
<p>14 - 0</p>
<p>15 - 0</p>
<p>16 - 0</p>
<p>17 - 0</p>
<p>18 - 0</p>
<p>19 - 7</p>
<p>20 - 8</p>
<p>21 - 25 (out of 25)</p>
<p>Total tasks actioned: 630</p>
<p>Total tasks unactioned: 40</p>
<p>I’ve been working on about 70 tasks a day, and the number of tasks on the list has remained pretty well constant at 40-45. Futhermore the list, far from spreading over more and more pages, has compacted itself down to only three pages. I should mention too that the seven tasks on p. 19 are all once-a-day-only tasks waiting for tomorrow.</p></div>

<div>Forgive my ignorance. I can not find the method instructions, has this been made public?</div>

<div>Do you mean the 7 tasks on pg. 19?</div>

<div>Eagerly awaiting the instructions, especially if the method incorporates the theory you wrote about in another comment:<br>"My theory is that a properly handled and practised list removes the need for prioritization, goal-setting, planning and deadline-chasing - real “autofocus” in other words."<br><br>Unless I have misinterpreted the comment chain, and this theory is not applicable to the system you are working on at present.<br><br>A method that removes this issues, for the most part, would truly be a game-changer.</div>

<div>Any idea when and where you will be publishing the instructions for this new method? I'm experimenting myself with getting FVP to work for me, and I could use some guidance on how to overcome list resistance, so I would be curious to know how you handled that with your new method.</div>
