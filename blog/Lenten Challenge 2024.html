<div>Resistance Zero with date based dismissal (tasks older than 3 days are reviewed and dismissed with the 4 questions from Autofocus):<br><br>- Why was this dismissed?<br>- Does this need to be done at all?<br>- Is the time ripe to do it?<br>- Is it a distraction from my primary goals and commitments?</div>

<div>I have a question that leads from my choice of a TM system for this challenge.<br>The "fairy tale story revisited" has been the most clear "productivity method" that I have been able to come back and anchor my practice to. <br><br>Mark - has your thinking around effectiveness of TM systems transformed beyond what you wrote in the fairy tale story?  While it has provided me a framework for organizing my life and tasks, I face a lot of resistance once I start working on my tasks. I keep staring at my organized list, but then step back and procrastinate.</div>

<div>I don't have an official name for my life management system. Some components are rock solid, and have been working well for a few years. However I'm about to introduce a couple of analog tools, so this Lenten Challenge comes at a good time. As always, I appreciate your efforts and thinking Mark. <br><br>Working Title: Touchstone System (credit to the late Barbara Sher).</div>

<div>Mahesh:<br><br>Found it!<br><br>1. Chuck everything out of your life that you haven't time to do properly.<br>2. If it needs doing it must be done<br>3. Rotate your attention<br>4. Systems<br>5. Schedule time for yourself<br>6. Employ yourself<br>7. Treat resistance as a signpost to where you should be going. (Note this one particularly - Chapter 11 is all about this)<br><br>Probably the best time management advice ever given, IMHO..</div>

<div>Mark F: Yes that's the one. Thanks for the validation. I also find it provides a framework for building out all of the other practices you mention e.g. manana principle, FVP, Autofocus, etc. <br>After re-reading my question and your response I think I'm struggling with #7-Resistance. I can get everything into the right lists and rotate my attention, but once I'm there, I need to move in the direction of resistance.</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Mark H. - 2024-02-5 18:36</div>
<div>Regarding #7-Resistance: How would this work with Resistance:Zero?  This seems to be saying that we should do what we resist, but I thought that Resistance:Zero means to do what we have zero resistance for.  Could we alternate them, so on one pass we do one, and the next pass we do the other?</div>

<div class="comment-meta">avrum - 2024-02-6 22:09</div>
<div>Brent - I've been on an Index Card kick for a few months now. Curious - why/how are you using the index cards (as opposed to notebook)?</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Brent - 2024-02-6 22:45</div>
<div>Hi Avrum,  The short answer around index cards is I'm enjoying the tangible aspect of the cards.  The tactile nature of cards allows me to interact with my routines, projects, and tasks in a more committed way then simply scanning a long list does.  I literally pick up each card and interact with it by either working on it or consciously deferring it by moving it to a different stack.  I talked a little bit more about it here: <a href="../general_forum/Index Cards, Spinning Plates and Tickler Files.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2768953</a> <br>Brent</div>

<div>Simple Scanning, using a spiral composition notebook. <br><br>With a Leuchtturm 1917 weekly planner for scheduling and notetaking</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Mark H. - 2024-02-7 14:59</div>
<div>Brent, Avrum, <br><br>I have experimented with index cards, but give up quickly because there are so many that I have trouble organizing them.  I use a composition notebook and go through about 4-5 pages a day, so I am writing about 100 lines a day.  However,  I am thinking that if I just use the index card for projects, rather than tasks/notes too, perhaps there will be 30 or so current projects, and I would be able to keep track of them better.  Is that you use them for?</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Mark H. - 2024-02-7 15:08</div>
<div>Brent, Avrum, <br><br>Ok, so I read the thread about index cards.  I read there that Brent has 17 project cards, but then more recently you are using one thing per card.   17 index cards are manageable.  However, I can see more items on one page, so I can scan faster with a notebook than a large stack of index cards.  But I still have some trouble keeping track of progress on projects, so I could experiment with project on index cards.</div>

<div>I'm trying to decide between simple scanning, 5/2, and time surfing. Time surfing has been working really well for me, so I'm somewhat hesitant to switch, but now might be the time to play around a little bit. ;-) Maybe Time Surfing + Morning Pages? <br><br>Tough choice!</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Mike Brown - 2024-02-8 14:59</div>
<div>Aaron Hsu:<br><br>I spent an unconscionable number of days re-reading posts on AF1 and Simple Scanning and Mark's posts on the perfect system to refresh my memory, and also seriously considered Oliver Burkeman's very good 3-3-3 system. (Google that and you'll find out what you need to know.)<br><br>I have found that when my work is familiar and well-defined, I rarely refer to my lists. The work manages itself. I'm time-surfing. <br><br>But when there are no big projects or the work presented to me is in onesie-twosie packets and scraps -- when there is no large external motivator driving my day's work, in other words -- that's when 3-3-3 or declaring a Current Initiative or time-blocking is crucial to me, so that I don't drift.<br><br>I opted for Simple Scanning during the Challenge to see how/whether the simplicity of a list can really express and get moving on the larger life goals it floats on top of.</div>

<div>I'm just coming back to pen and paper, so I don't know if this qualifies as system, but I get into Lenten Challenge with a commitment to use a paper notebook (structured according to Bullet Journal directives) and maybe simple scanning as a general method to select the things that need attention.</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">

<div>Pablo,<br><br>Pen and paper certainly counts. In fact, it is recommended by many.</div>

<div>Hmmm. I woke this morning with the thought of starting with ’Dreams’ and, more generally, trying to get back into “Pull Mode”.<br>Strange that this wasn’t really a conscious decision and I’d forgotten entirely about the Lenten Challenge.  Subconscious time management…</div>

<div>I forgot to sign up ahead of time, but I am trying to dedicate myself this year to something completely different: pre-allocated time-blocking, in which I set ahead of time what should be the primary focus for a period of time. During this time block I am allowed to do anything genuinely more urgent that arises as long as I go back to the assigned task as soon as it is resolved. Anything else that comes up that is not more urgent than what I am doing should be jotted down to be time blocked at a later time. I am using a smart scheduling app to allocate tasks to my calendar.</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Mike Brown - 2024-03-19 19:22</div>
<div>Still using the simple scanning notebook, with project pages in the back for more detailed notes. <br><br>I'm relaxed about using it, though. When I'm under the gun and I can mentally track the multiple pieces of a monthly report I have to do via years of experience, I use the notebook to track stray things I will get to later.<br><br>Now, with the monthly report done, I have 2 weeks of largely unscheduled time and at that point, I clean up the notebook, prune tasks, flag items to return to later, and start using a bit of time-blocking to tackle specific bits of work. It's when I have no urgent work to perform or a schedule that I find myself drifting, so creating a schedule and referring to the notebook are necessary anchors.</div>

<div>The desire to switch to a new system is strong when I feel either overwhelmed or I lack focus. However, I made it all the way with SMEMA but it was touch and go at times.</div>

<div>How did everyone get on with their Lenten Challenge?  I chose RTM.  I didn't report it at the time, but I failed the challenge after about a week.  However, I still think it's a very good system, but I wasn't prepared to put in the effort to make it work for me. It highlighted the fact that a lot of my tasks that I thought were one-offs are actually recurring ones and that was useful.  I found I got bogged down in the  Unfinished section because it had to be processed in order.  However, I got a lot from the system, in that it's given me some new ideas to use.</div>
