<h1>High Intensity Use of Time - Ebook</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2017-11-5 20:07</div>
<div class="content"><p>I’m so pleased with this new system that I’ve decided that a blog post won’t do it justice. So I’m aiming to write an ebook which I will make available on this website.</p>
<p>I haven’t yet even begun to sketch out the contents, neither do I have any idea what the word-count of the book will be. So it will be a measure of the system’s effectiveness how long it takes me to write the book without a publisher breathing down my neck.</p>
<p>All the rest of the details will begin to take shape once I start working on it.</p></div>

<div>Very cool. Also, not releasing this immediately gives me a chance to practice sticking to a system for a longer time.</div>

<div>Great, can't wait to see your ideas.<br>I did think RAF and simple scanning is as good at it gets.<br>If you can find improvements that will be amazing!</div>

<div>Martin Williams:<br><br><< Will you be charging for this ebook? >><br><br>I haven't even thought about that yet. If I do charge, it won't be because I want the money. It'll be because people don't value what they get for free. I might make it that it comes free with a donation to a specific charity, or something like that.<br><br>But don't take any of this as gospel as the moment.</div>

<div>nuntym:<br><br>Do we have a tentative schedule on the ebook release yet?<br><br>No<br><br>Do we have a tentative schedule on the tentative schedule release yet?<br><br>No<br><br>Is time spent answering questions about the schedule subtracted from the time available to write the ebook?<br><br>Yes</div>

<div>I have been using the Random Forecasting Method (RFM) regarding the e-book:<br><br>1.  When you wonder about when Mark will be done with his e-book, roll a six-sided die.<br>2.  The number on the die indicates the current forecast as to when Mark will be done.<br>3.  Scan through this list until one of these units of time "stands out" for you:<br><br>        * years<br>        * months<br>        * weeks<br>        * days<br>        * hours<br>        * minutes<br><br>4.  The number on the die combined with the unit that stood out for you is the current forecast for completion.  (E.g. "three weeks").<br><br>Hope this helps.</div>

<div>Mark<br><br>As your new system wont be published for some time do you have any particular system recommendation until then?</div>
</div>

<div>Caibre65:<br><br>Sorry, I missed your comment at the time.<br><br>I think the best on which to practise the principles which I'm writing about at the moment in preparation for the new system would be either Simple Scanning or No Dismissal Autofocus.</div>

<div>nuntym:<br><br>I've specifically recommended two methods, but there are plenty of other which would be suitable.</div>

<div>I believe I have all of Mark's books. Did this method ever become an e-book?</div>

<div>Donna:<br><br><<  Did this method ever become an e-book? >><br><br>No, it didn't. I came across problems which I didn't succeed in solving to my satisfaction.
