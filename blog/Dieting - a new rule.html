<h1>Dieting - a new rule</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2007-03-20 15:27</div>
<div class="content"><p>I’ve decided that in my list of rules, there is too fast a progression to starting skipping meals. After all the idea is that skipping meals should be an occasional exception, not the norm.</p><p>So I have decided to try out a new rule which comes between “No Sweets” and “Skip 1 Meal”. The new rule is:</p><p><em>Single Course only</em></p><p>This means that you are only allowed one course at a meal. And no, you’re not allowed to pile your plate to the ceiling, because the “Small Portions” rule will be in effect at the same time!</p><p>I’ve been thinking of introducing this rule for some time, but it was only today that I was in a position to try it out. So far, so good!</p><p>[See <a href="/blog/2006/12/4/can-i-improve-on-the-no-s-diet.html">here</a> for the other rules]</p></div>

<div>Here is another possible rule: no carbohydrates.<br><br>Sort of a mini atkins diet where you cut out the potatoes, pasta, rice and the like until the weight is back where you want it.</div>
