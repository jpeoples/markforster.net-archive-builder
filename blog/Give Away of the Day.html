<div class="content"><p>A new feature on this site is the <strong>Give Away of the Day</strong>, which you will find near the bottom of the left-hand sidebar. Everyday a new piece of software will be featured which you can download entirely free of charge. Beware though - you can only download the software for free on the day that it is featured on the sidebar. You can still click through and download previous days' software - but you will have to pay the manufacturer's normal price.</p><p>These programs are not shareware and will not time expire, provided you activate them within the time scale shown.</p></div>
