<h1>Get everything done fast</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2011-09-23 15:16</div>
<div class="content"><p>Since last reporting on progress with the <strong>Final Version</strong> on Monday, I’ve made a few minor changes to the system to fine-tune the balance.</p>
<p>The result of my latest test is a bit different from what I was originally expecting. I had been talking in earlier posts about this being a <a href="../blog/Key Principles of the New System II Universal Capture.html">universal capture</a> system which would filter out the dross and focus on what was really important. The implication being that quite a lot of the tasks entered wouldn’t get done.</p>
<p>But what is happening at the moment is that it’s<strong> </strong><em>all</em> getting done. And not just done, but done <em>fast</em>. In fact so fast that I’m almost taken aback at the speed at which everything is happening.</p>
<p>No doubt I could put enough work into the system to break it if I tried. But it’s keeping pace at the moment quite happily with the speed at which new work arrives on my desk (or in my mind) without the need for any filtering or auditing.</p></div>

<div>Please don't hesitate contacting me if you'd like a beta tester for a busy law firm environment.</div>

<div>Some of the tasks that take me the longest are ones that I don't know what the exact next action should be. This usually includes troubleshooting problems. I wonder how the Final Version would interact with such tasks.<br><br>The AF and SF systems tend to cause those tasks to cycle through multiple times per day as I think about them and try new approaches.</div>

<div>Alan:<br><br><< Why is work faster? >><br><br>That's a good question. And I actually don't know the answer yet. I need to observe what's going on for longer.<br><br>I know this is only a crude indicator, but over the last two days I have taken action on 149 tasks. My list now contains 81 unactioned tasks. That means that I am actioning tasks at the rate of 74.5 tasks a day, so my current list represents 1.09 days work at my current speed.<br><br>Perhaps most importantly, the 81 remaining tasks do not include any old ones languishing for lack of attention.<br><br>I'm so intrigued by this question that I've decided to start a new list and monitor how many days' work my list represents at the end of each day. <br><br>I ought to mention that none of the tasks in my sample above were deleted or dismissed, though I would normally included those in the definition of "actioned".</div>

<div>Ryan:<br><br>The system interacts with that type of task in much the same way as AF and SF, i.e. cycling through them multiple times a day.</div>

<div>"74.5 tasks a day" - if those are different tasks, I would take as a sign of excessive frittering, unless there was a sense of major progress on big tasks as well. I'm much happier myself with 20 mini tasks worked, 20 zapped, and 2 biggies with major progress (which isn't about hours, but accomplishment).</div>

<div>The Thing is, I don't think it means 74.5 accomplished, just moved each forward a bit.</div>

<div>Mark, I would pay to beta-test this. As a side effect, it would settle my priorities on several upcoming donations (hint, hint), on which I've been procrastinating.</div>

<div>Alan:<br><br><< The Thing is, I don't think it means 74.5 accomplished, just moved each forward a bit. >><br><br>That's correct. I mean that I have taken action on a task as written as an item on my list so that it is crossed out. But if I didn't finish it then it will get further action pdq.</div>

<div>Mark <br><br>I think "filtering out the dross" and focus on what is important is a very important part of your system.<br><br>Is there some way you can ease off the action, and increase the filtering a few notches.</div>

<div>w.hong.leung:<br><br><< Is there some way you can ease off the action, and increase the filtering a few notches. >><br><br>I don't know. I'm into unknown territory here. My thinking at the moment is that if everything one puts on the list gets done within a couple of days, then that fact in itself will tend to alter the nature of the things which one puts on the list.</div>
