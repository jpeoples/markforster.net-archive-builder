<div>How ironic, I just added your site to my blog roll today and then noticed this post!  I also blogged about your book and the DIT method for the first time today ( <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2o6ays" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/2o6ays</a> ).  <br><br>Thank you for all you're doing, I'm excited to get learn more about DIT and  your other ideas in the productivity space.  JACK</div>

<div>Hi, Jack<br><br>Thanks very much for the mention. I'll be very interested in how you find DIT in your work. <br><br>I enjoyed looking at your blog. I see we have similar ideas on politics - whether left or right are "in power" the system is broken - even more so in Britain I think than in the States.<br><br>DIT is very good for keeping up the regularity of your blog postings - whenever you think of a subject for a posting just put it in your Task Diary for tomorrow.</div>

<div>Hi, Mark<br><br>Litemind is the last item on the blogroll. You'll see that it comes under a main heading (white on blue) of "Useful Blogs".</div>
