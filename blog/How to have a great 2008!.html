<div>Here's the text:<br><br><br>How To Make 2008 Great!<br> <br><br>If you want to make 2008 one of the great years of your life you will need: <br><br><br>* a clear vision of the life you would like to be living by the end of the year<br><br><br>* some goals to help you achieve your vision<br><br><br>* an awareness of your strengths and weaknesses to help you on your way<br><br><br>* an ability to focus your attention and use your thoughts, feelings, words and actions in a way that brings benefit to yourself and others<br><br><br>* the courage and determination to put into practice for at least 21 days any changes you want to make.<br> <br><br>Bearing this in mind, take time out to relax and create a reflective mood in which to answer the following questions:<br> <br><br>1. In what ways would you like your life to be different by the end of 2008?<br> <br><br>2. If you were to choose an overall theme (for example, happiness) to give the year more structure and direction what would it be?<br> <br><br>3. What drains and/or blocks your energy? How can you change this?<br> <br><br>4. Name three changes in your consumption habits that would help improve your health.<br> <br><br>5. What regular physical exercise will you commit to this year?<br> <br><br>6. What improvements would you like to make in your personal relationships?<br> <br><br>7. Name three ways in which you could economise. What will you do with the money that you save?<br> <br><br>8. How can you become more ‘time-rich’ both at home and at work? What will you do with the time that you save?<br> <br><br>9. How can you make your work more enjoyable and stress-free?<br> <br><br>10. Think of the qualities of someone you really admire and respect. How can you develop those qualities more in yourself?<br> <br><br>11. Name three ways in which you will care more for yourself this year.<br> <br><br>12. What will you do to nurture your inner spirit?<br> <br><br>13. If you had one wish for the world that could be granted, what would it be? How can you help make that wish come true?<br> <br><br>14. What is the single most important change you could make to improve the quality of your life?<br> <br><br><a href="http://www.stresslesstraining.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.stresslesstraining.co.uk/</a><br><br></div>

<div>Hi Mark<br>WOW!  Thank you very much for going the extra mile.  I truly appreciate it.  These questions are rich fodder indeed!  I'll have great fun playing with this...it seems I stand to gain much working with this.  Once again you've provided another great adjunct to your wonderful system!<br>vickie</div>

<div>Hi, Matthew<br><br>It's still working for me, using exactly the same combination as you. So I have no idea what's causing the problem. Very annoying!<br><br>Anyway the text is above so, if you want to download it, just copy and paste it.</div>

<div>I'm sure that someone posted information re a good website for page a day diaries, but ordering a single copy in February has proved tricky! I'd be grateful for a suggestion.  Web browsing for a suitable site has used up too much valuable time!</div>

<div>FlickB:<br>Where are you based? Most stationers in UK are selling them off cheaply at the moment. I bought mine at Staples for £2.49. <br><br>Alternatively Amazon UK is selling one for £2.48 at <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/burgundy-diary-format-ribbon-bookmark/dp/B000V3IB52/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1203681510&sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.co.uk/burgundy-diary-format-ribbon-bookmark/dp/B000V3IB52/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1203681510&sr=8-1</a></div>

<div>Thanks Mark.  I can't think how I missed the one on Amazon.  I'll order one today. Your books are very motivating.  I've just started reading 'Do it tomorrow' - again.</div>
