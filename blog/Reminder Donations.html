<h1>Reminder: Donations</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2012-01-25 9:22</div>
<div class="content"><p>Just a reminder that everything on this site is free with the exception of my books (and one of those is a free download). That gives you access to one of the most powerful time management systems, hundreds of articles, a forum to ask questions and discuss your time management problems or ideas, and frequent new articles and updates.</p>
<p>There are no ads on the site, apart from the books. OK, there may be one or two lurking in dark corners which I haven’t spotted. These are from the days when there <em>were</em> ads on the site. Whenever I come across one I remove it. They produce virtually no income in any case.</p>
<p>The site does cost money to maintain and a vast amount of time too. So if you want to show your appreciation, don’t forget the donation box in the margin. I’m very grateful to those who have donated in the past, but I haven’t had even one donation for months now!</p>
<p>Anything you feel like giving will be greatly appreciated. And to make it easy, you don’t even have to go to the margin - here’s the box!</p>

<div>Thank you very much Mark, for all the effort and availability to share your work and knowledge. I haven't bought any of your books but have come to learn their lessons and best practices exclusively through this site.<br><br>Your advices were a lifeline at a time I felt in utter chaos (jumping head-down into starting a business, in the middle of a family revolution), by giving tools and pointing to directions on how to handle things, in ways that leverage intuition and deal so well with the flexibility of our "modern" lives.<br><br>Thank you!<br><br>… and you'll be sure to see me back in the donation box when, with your help, 2012 pans out to be like I'm aiming for ;)</div>

<div>Oh that was sad Mark. Don't worry, I'll help you get across your message to others so that they too can donate.</div>

<div>Forgive an ignorant question, but when I looked at the donate page, the amount was in pounds. However, I am in the United States so I am not sure how it will work out what I get charged or if in fact I will donate what I intended to donate. Is there some way I am using the donate page incorrectly? I did select United States as my country. Thanks!</div>

<div>CJacobs:  Let's say you wanted to donate US$1,000 to Mark, which would probably make Mark very happy.  You could enter the following into a Google search:<br><br>1000 USD in pounds<br><br>as shown in this link:  https://www.google.com/search?q=1000+usd+in+pounds</div>

<div>CJacobs:<br><br>Thanks for your intention to donate something. It is very much appreciated.<br><br>Oddly enough in the UK I don't get pre-set amounts if I press the donate button. I can donate the exact figure I want to. So it's difficult for me to advise you because I don't know how PayPal is set up to work in the US.<br><br>The simplest thing is to enter "sterling dollar rate" into Google and that will tell you that 	<br>1 British pound = 1.5723 U.S. dollars as of this minute. So if you donated £1 you would be charged somewhere around $1.60, £10 would be approximately $16 and so on.</div>
