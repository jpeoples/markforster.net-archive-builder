<h1>Thoughts on the Long List</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2017-06-17 7:44</div>
<div class="content"><p>While I’ve been semi-incapacitated recently (suspected Guillain-Barré Syndrome on top of the expected side-effects of chemotherapy), I’ve been working on an outline for a book on the subject of the “catch-all” list.</p>
<p>My theory is that a properly handled and practised list removes the need for prioritization, goal-setting, planning and deadline-chasing - real “autofocus” in other words.</p>
<p>It’s not dependent on any particular way of handling the list, though I’ve found simple scanning to be the easiest and most reliable for my own use. It’s more a change of attitude than a new system.</p>
<p>Typing is still very difficult for me so my intention at the moment is to write about this in dribs and drabs over the next few weeks (or possibly months). We’ll see whether the “long list theory” supports me in doing this in practice.</p></div>

<div>Great to hear from you again, Mark.<br><br>I found your arguments against long lists in Secrets convincing-principally, that they dilute focus. But as always, I look forward to your results.<br><br>We are all rooting for you.</div>
