<h1>Work At or Work On?</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2007-03-28 7:00</div>
<div class="content"><p>One of the most most important distinctions we can make about our work is the distinction between “working at” our business and “working on” our business. What is the difference between them?</p><p>“Working at” our business at first sight seems to be what our business is all about. It’s dealing with clients, answering correspondence, sending out invoices, paying bills, writing materials, and doing all the hundred and one other things that we think of as our work.</p><p>“Working on” our business is quite different. It’s taking a step back and looking at it from outside. Looking at where the business is going,making strategic decisions, deciding what new initiatives to take.</p><p>The problem for most of us is that we get so immersed in the routine “busy work” of our businesses that we seldom or never give time to thinking strategically. But if you want your business, or whatever it is that you are involved in, to take off then it is essential that you schedule regular time to work ON your business.</p><p>A good book to read which cover this subject (and plenty more) is Michael Gerber’s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0887307280?tag=markforstthet-21&camp=1406&creative=6394&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=0887307280&adid=1NM1F9KRE5BCCXBKXAPS&" target="_blank">The E-Myth Revisited</a></em>.</p></div>
