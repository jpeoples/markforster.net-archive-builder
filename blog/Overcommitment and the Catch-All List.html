<h1>Overcommitment and the Catch-All List</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2016-02-23 7:00</div>
<div class="content"><p>In yesterday’s article <a href="../blog/Overcommitment - and what you can do to prevent it.html">Overcommitment and what you can do to prevent it</a> I drew attention to the formula given in <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0340909129/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0340909129&linkCode=as2&tag=markforstthet-21">Do It Tomorrow</a>:</p>
<p><em>Backlog = (Average work coming in each day) - (average work going out each day)</em></p>
<p>In spite of all our efforts to ignore this rule there really is no way round it. However we can continue to fool ourselves by acting in much the same way as a chronic debtor continues to get further and further into debt. In other words we put things off into the future. In the same way that the debtor always believes that “something will come up”, so we believe in a magic fairytale day in which we have nothing else to do other than catch up with our work. Of course this day never arrives, and if by some amazing chance it actually did the sudden relaxation of tension probably would mean that we spent the whole day goofing off rather than working.</p>
<p>It’s interesting to see how this truth about workload plays out in various situations. How does it work with a “catch-all” list? Now the great advantage of a catch-all list is its completeness. You get everything on your mind down on paper so you no longer have the worry of trying to remember it all. There is however a problem with this. The work does not stop arriving just because you have written it all down. In fact writing it all down may make it <em>less</em> likely that you will get everything done, rather than more. This is because there is a certain natural selection going on with tasks, which means the stronger ones survive while the weaker ones go to the wall. The problem with writing everything down is that this natural selection is inhibited because the weaker tasks can’t take the natural path of dropping out of your memory and your life.</p>
<p>Anyway, as I said in yesterday’s article overcommitment is a systems failure, and the first step with any systems failure is to look at what is happening in our present system. How does this apply to a catch-all list?</p>
<p>Potential candidates to be tasks on our catch-all list come from a multitude of sources, e.g. our own “brilliant ideas”, our bosses, our clients, our colleagues, our families, our reading, social media, the tv, etc, etc, etc. On top of these existing tasks which need further work get re-entered on the list rather than deleted.</p>
<p>Let’s first of all look at the input procedure:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A potential task arrives on the scene from one of the above sources</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A catch-all system is designed to catch everything. So the task is put on the list without further ado.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Another task arrives on the scene and is put on the list</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">and so on</p>
<p>No problem so far. The input procedure is doing exactly what it is designed to do.</p>
<p>What about the output procedure? That’s even simpler:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We do one task after another (according to the criteria of whatever system we are using to process the list)</p>
<p>But it’s here that we run into a problem: the time it takes to do a task is usually longer than it takes to write a task down. Since that means that tasks come in faster than it’s possible to do them, more and more tasks get pushed into the future.</p>
<p>So our problem with the existing system can be summed up as:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Potential work coming in each day is basically infinite</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Work going out each day is finite</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Therefore the list is potentially liable to expand infinitely</p>
<p>Fortunately in reality this doesn’t happen to quite that extent, but it’s easy to see what the present system is inevitably going to produce. Overcommitment.</p>
<p>Are there any improvements that we could make to a catch-all list system so that it doesn’t result in overcommitment? Well, here’s a few suggestions:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Authorized Project List</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Stringent evaluation of tasks before writing them down</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Limit on the number of tasks on the list</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Limit on the estimated time it will take to do the tasks on the list</p>
<p>These are all on the right lines. But unfortunately they all suffer from the same thing. They require discipline and willpower, plus a correct judgement of the amount of time available.</p>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<p>There is no doubt that a catch-all list has some advantages, the chief of which is the feeling of completeness arising from having everything down on paper. But unfortunately having everything down on paper is not the same as getting everything done.</p>

I can't wait to find out about the new system.<br><br>In GTD full capture is in large part about getting ideas out of your head to stop them distracting you and pulling you out of the present (and away from your current task), in the same way that labelling works in meditation. The difficulty with this approach is that it only works as long as you trust the system. Once the system gets gummed up with lots of old irrelevant stuff, it gets abandoned.<br><br>To be fair to David Allen, there is supposed to be a mid-step, so that capturing ideas happens separately from evaluating whether they warrant working on. It may just be my sloppy execution that made me abandon it, or possibly due to the system having too many moving parts.</div>

<div>Amazing post. The analogy of the chronic debtor is very apt,<br><br>Recently, I have changed my list structure (in Wunderlist) to have (i) a "5T" list which represents 5 tasks that have my immediate focus, (ii) a "Work Commitment" List which represents specific projects/tasks that need to be done to fulfill promises made to others, and a (iii) "No Commitment" List which is similar to a Catch All List.  In addition, any Future Commitments are put in my calendar - and on the day that I need to start to do them, they end up in my 5T list or my Work Commitment List.   I also have a "Home Commitment" List which contains commitments I have made in my personal life outside of work.  The 5T list is the list I work from and is populated from anything I feel is important at the time, but often also draws from the Work Commitment List.<br><br>In the few days that I have implemented this approach, I have felt productive and have had no concerns about dropping anything.  I have also accomplished almost nothing from the No Commitments List which would support Mark's thesis that a Catch All List isn't all that useful.</div>

<div>Michael B:<br><br><< DWM >><br><br>DWM is a sort of half-way step to a no-list method. Or perhaps a quarter-way step would be a better description.<br><br>It consists of a catch-all list on which each task expires after 30 days if it hasn't been worked on.<br><br>Tasks which have been worked on but not completed (including recurrent tasks) are transferred to a second list. They expire after 7 days if not worked on again.<br><br>It does have the advantage of preventing the list from expanding indefinitely, but you are still dealing with a huge list which is unrelated to a properly balanced workload. Let's look at the basic equation I repeated in today's post:<br><br>Backlog = (Average work coming in each day) - (average work going out each day)<br><br>What you are doing with DWM is simply trimming the backlog. The basic rule that work in must equal work out is still not applied. For DWM you could rephrase it as:<br><br>Work not done = (Average work coming in each day) - (average work going out each day).</div>

<div>Mark, your logic is flawless. Can you explain how all the catch-all processes you promoted over the years worked well? I  am beginning to suspect that none of these systems did exactly what it says on can.</div>

<div>Thanks Mark, interesting post.  I particularly like:<br><br>"...there is a certain natural selection going on with tasks, which means the stronger ones survive while the weaker ones go to the wall. The problem with writing everything down is that this natural selection is inhibited because the weaker tasks can’t take the natural path of dropping out of your memory and your life."<br><br>I find this to be very true, and to be honest it has been one of my problems with using DIT. I like DIT's elegance and it means some good, often procrastinated over, stuff gets done, but also (frankly) some dross gets done which probably should have withered on the vine!  Any ideas from you and others on how to avoid that?</div>

<div>Will:<br><br><< Can you explain how all the catch-all processes you promoted over the years worked well? >><br><br>That's a good question.<br><br>First of all, none of my books promotes a catch-all system. Get Everything Done proposes a short list of projects around which one circulates throughout the day. How to Make Your Dreams Come True is about not having a list at all. Do It Tomorrow is about only having one day's worth of work a day.<br><br>However after the publication of Do It Tomorrow I found that people were trying to work the DIT system without paying attention to the very strict audit procedure which I had incorporated. The result was that they were building up very long day lists which then got carried forward from day after day. <br><br>Faced with this I realised that there were two course open to me:<br><br>1) Carry on trying to teach people how to do DIT properly<br><br>2) Accept that they were not going to get the message and see if I could invent a system which could actually cope with the reality that people love their lists!<br><br>I decided that without abandoning 1) I would accept the challenge of 2). My first attempt was Autofocus (as it was then called) which is now known as AF1. I still think it's the best of the catch-all systems. I built into it a limiter called "dismissal", the aim of which was to purge the list of stuff that simply wasn't getting done. Unfortunately I found that people were very reluctant to dismiss tasks, regarding it as some sort of punishment for failure rather than as an essential part of the system. So lists tended to grow and grow with the result that AF1 became very slow. <br><br>Again I found that I had to accept people as they are rather than as how I would like them to be and carried on trying to develop a system which would correct the problems with AF1. <br><br>In the end I decided that the problem could only be solved by making it impossible to grow the list - and that could only be done by not having a list at all. <br><br>So the answer to your question is:<br><br>Get Everything Done works great provided you don't use it to take on more and more work (as the book frequently warns you)<br><br>How to Make Your Dreams Come True works great provided you don't use it to take on more and more work (as the book frequently warns you)<br><br>Do It Tomorrow works great provided you don't use it to take on more and more work (as the book frequently warns you)<br><br>Autofocus works great provided you use the dismissal procedure to prevent yourself from taking on more and more work.<br><br>No-list works great because you can't use the system to take on more and more work.</div>

<div>Thanks, Mark.<br><br>I rather liked the "2-3 days rule" in DIT, but the rules in AF1 seemed almost magical in the way they used the subconscious to prioritise. It felt as though my priorities emerged from what I was actually doing, rather than the more traditional setting priorities separately and making conscious choices based on them. <br><br>The tension in the AF series was between "urgent" and "strategic". With all of these systems, there seemed to be a natural flow from task to task.<br><br>Now, there seems to be a new tension between focus and flow.<br><br>I should admit that I never used the old systems rigorously, and shamelessly allowed the lists to grow out of control. And that I also find myself sitting wondering what to add to my "no list" from time to time, which is rather worrying.<br><br>The struggle continues!<br><br>Thanks again!</div>

<div>Great post!   I especially liked this snippet -- << But unfortunately they all suffer from the same thing. They require discipline and willpower, plus a correct judgement of the amount of time available. >><br><br>This was exactly what I was thinking, when reading your first post on overcommitment.  I'm looking forward to what else you have to say about this!   <br><br><br>Also - it seems like all time management systems need a filtering mechanism.<br><br>Catch-all systems do the filtering on the output side (e.g., AutoFocus; also the rule in all of Mark's catch-all systems to delete any task that is no longer relevant)<br><br>No-list systems do the filtering on the input side (e.g., Default No when asked to take on new work; limits on projects; limits on tasks; etc.)<br><br>I am wondering whether the failure is not so much in the catch-all system per se, but more in the filtering mechanisms?   <br><br>For catch-all systems, perhaps the simple act of just writing a task down giving the task too much power, too much credence, too much presence on the list?   And that's the fundamental limitation of catch-all systems?  I can think of obvious silly examples where the answer is clearly "YES" -- such as writing down "get out of bed, brush teeth, put on clothes, put on shoes, etc." every morning before getting out of bed.   But there is the opposite extreme:  not writing down important commitments, not writing down deadlines, etc.   So:  how do we find the sweet spot to get the right stuff onto the list in the first place?<br><br>I am also wondering what other ideas you have for how the no-list approach overcomes the weak filtering problems of catch-all systems.</div>

<div>I like the no-list system so far. I feel a lot less stressed and I focus a lot more on the same project(s) +-3 or 4 till I get it done.  Example: My taxes are almost due and this is one item in my life which I absolutely love (hate?) to procrastinate on.  I can do my companies taxes, but for some reason, my own is a very hard nut to crack.  <br><br>With this system it started on my initial daily 5 item selection on for 4 days of the week last week.  It kept circulating around and now it is almost done..only items outstanding are items I am waiting for.<br><br>I do however not enter a specific task for this project on my task list.  I only enter "My tax" and it will be circulating around on my daily list until it is done or until I feel I have worked enough on this for today.  <br><br>I am currently reading Mark's "Secrets.." book and it states that you need to write clearly what you need to do till you are done for the day on such a large project.  (example Mark is using is something like read x amount of pages..). I guess with only writing "My tax" I am implying that I want to make progress on the project and if I feel that I have made enough progress for the day, then it is done for the day.<br><br>Any comments on my view?<br><br>PS Mark, my train ride home yesterday was very boring as I was missing the article of the day..</div>

<div>Mark<br><br>Your post above about each book and the stress within each to not take on too much work was excellent. Also interesting is your take on why you developed each catch-all list system. Without dismissing the last 15 years of your work(!) I still think your first book and choosing 10 categories or groupings (at most) and rotating around them in timeboxes to provide regular sufficient attention is still the most elegant and simple time management system. If only I followed it! You have consistently talked about not taking on too many commitments and whilst we all admire the work you do, you must get fed up with us not paying any attention!<br><br>I am currently back to using the GED system with one of my categories as Current Initiative to use the very useful suggestion from DIT. But at the end of the day it s about not taking on too much. We are all still trying to get the quart into the pint pot (which you mentioned in that very first book)</div>

<div>There seem to be two objections to recording unrelated ideas when you are focusing on a task.<br><br>1. That this floods your task list with a never ending deluge of things you will never get around to. This can be mitigated by limiting your recording to existing dynamic lists. <br><br>2. That if you are focusing properly, all your ideas will relate to the task in hand. I'm not sure about this. I certainly don't focus enough, but I often deal with interruptions by jotting them on a list which I may or may not get to later.</div>

<div>Apparently Earl Nightingale used to say “Ideas are like slippery fish.

<div>I find that if an idea pops into my head and I write it down, when I come across it again on a list, hours, days or weeks later, it will have lost its freshness and most of its meaning. If, however, I have an idea and mull on it there and then, if it is a good one it won't be forgotten, won't lose its freshness, and will have increased in meaning when the idea comes up again.<br><br>My mind is great at sorting the wheat from the chaff, and if I leave it to get on with the job, the best ideas will surface again, stronger, and the crap ideas will disappear like they have never existed, which is what I want.<br><br>The problem I have had in the past, and which many of you seem to have now, is to have the feeling that just because you had an idea, it must be a good one. And worse, the feeling that you had an absolutely brilliant, life-changing idea, but you lost it because you didn't write it down.<br><br>In my opinion, the best way to lose that brilliant idea is to write it down, because the act of writing it down diminishes it. If it is as good as you think, it will stay in your mind and will surface again, maybe at a better time. And if the idea is so brilliant, perhaps you should drop everything else and act on it immediately, not save it for later.<br><br>Mark's dynamic lists and questioning methods are great for resurfacing the best ideas.</div>

<div>Mark,<br><br>Let's take an example. I see someone with a bottle of water at work. That's a good idea. But when I'm actually leaving the house, I am thinking about the chickens I have just fed, the sick dog, the best route to work, the state of the family, and so on and so on. The list of things I'm thinking about varies, but for the last month, the water bottle has never featured. So I make do with multiple trips to the water fountain through the day or, worse, simply don't drink enough and get dehydrated.<br><br>I agree that simply jotting it down on a list isn't the answer in itself. (I do have a list of "Things I keep forgetting".) <br><br>I also agree that if I forget it, my deep subconscious can't believe that it is important. But we know that the deep subconscious follows a number of heuristics evolved to fit the way we lived thousands of years ago, which don't necessarily fit the way we live now. Compensating for these must be one of the key features of any effective focus management system. We could go through the catch-all systems and how they achieve this, when properly used. I suspect that your new system will also do this, whether you have thought about it consciously or not.</div>

<div>Will,<br><br>While you are thinking about it, right this moment, go on Amazon and buy a nice water bottle and have it delivered to you at work. Get a big one, like a litre or more. Then one visit to a water source once a day to fill it is all you need. When it is empty and you are thirsty will become a trigger to go and fill the bottle again. You'll never have to consciously think about it again.</div>

It's a matter of setting up a routine. Do you have a check-list for the things you take to work every day? If not, that's what you need to put on your list!</div>

<div>Mark, back on the book list. I am using the site "Goodreads" to record all books I have read and all books that looks interesting to me. I would for example read your book and you would refer to a book that looks interesting to me.  I will then add this to the list of books to consider when I choose to read my next book.<br><br>There is no way that I will remember all references that looks interesting and this book list is a very hand tool for me.<br><br>Also, I do not in any way consider this as a backlog as I know this is not something I will have to complete, but more a reference point.  This does not cause psychological stress for me as a result.</div>

<div>Nico:<br><br>If it works for you, use it. I'm not trying to stop you. <br><br>But as for me when I've finished a book and am looking for the next one to read the last place I'd look is a list which I'd been accumulating over a long period of time. It would be out of date and irrelevant to where I am now.<br><br>Instead I would either go for a book that is on my mind for reading now, or look for one on a subject that is on my mind now.</div>

<div>I also use Goodreads, but only to record what I'm reading and have read. I don't use it to accumulate reading suggestions. I've long held that the 'tbr' (To Be Read) list is not a good idea because - for me, at least - it makes my reading prescriptive, and therefore inevitably a chore. <br><br>A few years back I abandoned reading lists. I now wait till I finish a book then spend a happy time perusing my collection - or the library's - in choosing a new title purely according to my mood in that moment. Ever since doing so, I rediscovered my voracious love of reading and more often than not enjoy what I'm reading more. Doing so has been utterly liberating.<br><br>All the time I hear people say "I'm working my way through ' The Top 100 this... ', and ' The Top 50 that...', and I think "Why? Why would you commit your time and energy in wading against a molasses-tide of things that you 'ought to/should do' because other people say you must, on a list that is dated, inflexible and so very rarely matches whatever your current mood?"<br><br>It goes without saying, of course, that what works for me may not be the same for others.</div>

<div>Thanks, Mark.<br><br>The point about having a water bottle is that you always have water to hand. This minimises time wasted on all that tedious socialising and exercise (126 steps there and back. It all adds up!).<br><br>The point I was trying to make in my reply to Wooba was that you start thinking about how to get to work properly equipped, and you may find that the question goes much deeper. My problem is, essentially, that this sort of thing is rarely top of my mind when I'm casting around for the next three things to put on my list. <br><br>This may be a question of getting into the right mind-set. Or I might show myself an accumulating list of topics for the day. Or possibly a dynamic list for the day's , which would add some bite to the choice of theme.<br><br>Incidentally, I discovered this morning that my wife had been dealing with her inboxes, one of which is household clutter.  It took a while to find where she had tidied the bottle.</div>

<div>Hi Nico, personally I think it's really important to give yourself permission to not finish a book if you're really struggling with it. Or even put it away for a time when you're more psychologically ready for it. Sometimes it can be the right book but just the wrong time to read it. <br><br>At the end of the day, I read for pleasure. If something really becomes a chore there's no shame in putting it away and starting something that fits my mood.</div>

If for instance you want to read Milton's "Paradise Lost" you have to accept the fact that it's going to be a much more demanding exercise than reading the latest thriller or pop-psychology book.</div>

<div>"I agree, though I think it's important to allow for the fact that some books simply require more of an effort to get through."<br><br>Yes, absolutely. Though I was thinking along the lines of, for instance, giving yourself permission to halt reading because the book is badly written, has poor character development, completely unrealistic, is exploitative  etc<br><br>The title you mention - Milton's 'Paradise Lost' - is a good example of where some extra effort and application can be very rewarding. But even then,  a lot depends on when you read it and whether you're psychologically ready for it. I've abandoned some great works in frustration only to thoroughly enjoy them six months or a year later.</div>

<div>Mike:<br><br>I did once try to learn Paradise Lost but never got further than the end of the first sentence (which is a lot further than you think!)<br><br>One of the most common feats of memory is learning the Qu'ran by heart, which is 77,439 words long. This qualifies the learner (assuming he or she is a Muslim) for the title of Hafiz. You have to learn it in Arabic of course.<br><br>Back in the early days of Christianity in order to qualify as a Bishop you were expected to know the Book of Psalms by heart. I don't know how many words that is but I believe it takes about five hours to recite.</div>

<div>I think Westerners have some way to go in feats of memorization. From Language Log, one of my favourite blogs ( <a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=5669" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=5669</a> ):<br><br>.....<br><br>So uniquely rigorous and complex are the techniques of Indian memorization that it is worth quoting this capsule description from the Wikipedia article on smṛti:<br><br>Prodigious energy was expended by ancient Indian culture in ensuring that these texts were transmitted from generation to generation with inordinate fidelity.[8] For example, memorization of the sacred Vedas included up to eleven forms of recitation of the same text. The texts were subsequently "proof-read" by comparing the different recited versions.<br><br>Forms of recitation included the jaṭā-pāṭha (literally "mesh recitation") in which every two adjacent words in the text were first recited in their original order, then repeated in the reverse order, and finally repeated again in the original order.[9] The recitation thus proceeded as:<br><br>word1word2, word2word1, word1word2; word2word3, word3word2, word2word3; …<br><br>In another form of recitation, dhvaja-pāṭha[9] (literally "flag recitation") a sequence of N words were recited (and memorized) by pairing the first two and last two words and then proceeding as:<br><br>word1word2, word(N-1)wordN; word2word3, word(N-3)word(N-2); …; word(N-1)wordN, word1word2;<br><br>The most complex form of recitation, ghana-pāṭha (literally "dense recitation"), according to (Filliozat 2004, p. 139), took the form:<br><br>word1word2, word2word1, word1word2word3, word3word2word1, word1word2word3; word2word3, word3word2, word2word3word4, word4word3word2, word2word3word4; …<br><br>That these methods have been effective, is testified to by the preservation of the most ancient Indian religious text, the Rigveda (ca. 1500 BCE), as a single text, without any variant readings.[9] Similar methods were used for memorizing mathematical texts, whose transmission remained exclusively oral until the end of the Vedic period (ca. 500 BCE).<br><br>Perhaps today's English spelling bee champions of Indian descent are the heirs to these traditions and techniques, whether consciously or not.</div>

<div><< But unfortunately they all suffer from the same thing. They require discipline and willpower, plus a correct judgement of the amount of time available. >><br><br>I'm still thinking about this...   about mechanisms to prevent overwhelm, that don't "require discipline and willpower" but simply happen in the normal course of working.  <br><br>For example:  "just say no" ... "be careful about what work you agree to take on"...   Great ideas, of course.   The problem is with the HOW.   <br><br>The Simple Rules book has ideas on how to do this -- think through what you really want; think of some simple criteria that will help you decide if things line up with what you want; then just apply those rules.   <br><br>This still requires "discipline and willpower", however.  It requires a conscious, thoughtful effort.  Normally I don't have anything against conscious, thoughtful effort!   But if that is REQUIRED as part of a key decision point in a recurring workflow, it will simply break under stress.<br><br>So, to take this a step further, whatever "simple rules" one makes for oneself, should ideally be worked into your standard routines and habits of work, so it just happens automatically, WITHOUT conscious, thoughtful effort.   The creation of the work routine itself is what needs the conscious, thoughtful effort.   <br><br>The 5T method seems to have this kind of thing "built in".  I still haven't been able to figure out how that works, though.  :-)</div>

<div>Seraphim:<br><br>Changing the habits of a lifetime requires practice. As I often say to people, a concert pianist has put in more than 10,000 hours of practice in order to play the piano the right way. They on the other hand have put in more than 10,000 hours of practice in doing things the wrong way. <br><br>The aim therefore has to be to practise doing things the right way so that the right way gets below the level of conscious thought.<br><br>I would say that the first step is to change your default position from saying Yes, to saying No. Then practise this endlessly. In "Get Everything Done" I recommend saying something like: "I have a rule that I will only take work on if I am in a position to do it properly. I don't feel that I would be able to in this case."<br><br>And don't forget that the most important person to say this to is yourself!</div>

<div>Thanks for this post, Mark.  It's given me some things to think about.   <br><br>"No" has been my default for years now, especially at the "commitment" or "project" level.  I may have had a problem with that in the past, but I don't think that was ever the core reason behind my giant lists and frequent feeling of overwhelm / overcommitment.   <br><br>We've had many discussions on this topic over the years, and you've often given me specific personal advice -- which I have always sincerely appreciated and taken to heart.   <br><br>I've implemented, internalized, and habitualized most of your other advice in this area as well, for example, having a project list, clear goals, limits in general.   I'd guess that I am 100x as productive, directly as a result of your ideas and advice, as I was when I first started coming here 7 years ago.  I mean that 100x literally, in terms of actual impact of what gets done.<br><br>But sometimes, the advice didn't seem to actually describe the problems I was having, or the results I was getting.   I have enough self-doubt that I always wonder about it, though, and go stew about it, to see if maybe I'm really missing something.<br><br>With this last exchange, I think I've come closer to the heart of the matter -- for me at least.  Basically, there are some nuances to the "work coming in must equal work coming out" formula that I need to address:<br><br>(1) Most of the time, the "work coming in" is just input, but I make the decision what the work actually is, and what to do with it.<br><br>(2) The hard decision is usually NOT "should I do this at all" but "what does this work really mean - who wants it done and why?", and "is this a 30-second task or a 30-minute task?   It's often not clear.  If a colleague asks me a question, I can give a 30-second answer, or I can give a 30-minute answer, or I can spend half a day putting together a PowerPoint presentation.  The actual need is not always immediately apparent.  It also frequently depends on everything else going on, all the conflicting priorities.<br><br>(3) I'm dealing with a wide variety of problems all day long... And I've always found that framing the problem correctly is 80% of the work. This requires thought and ideas -- which is why my lists fill up with thoughts and ideas.  It has never meant I intend to take action on every one of them.<br><br>(4) Thus I've never had any expectation that I need to get everything done on my lists.  The stuff I capture my lists has NEVER been lists of all the work I must get done -- but lists of all the things that MIGHT help move the work forward.  The various filtering mechanisms, dismissals, audits, WIP limits, etc., have all been ways of sorting through it all and deciding what is helpful, what's not, what's impactful, what's not, etc.  <br><br>Sometimes all that thought and framing doesn't really matter -- I should just default to the 30-second response, and if someone wants more than that, they'll let me know.   And apply that general principle to everything. Take a "minimum viable product" approach to absolutely everything.  It took me awhile to learn this -- but now, it's what I do most of the time.  This is probably one of the main keys behind that 100x productivity improvement:  realizing that the 30-second answer is usually just fine, and usually *preferable*, to the 30-minute answer.<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product</a><br><br>Even if "on average" the work demands must balance the work output, if you get a bunch of "big rocks" when you were expecting "medium rocks", this creates a short-term crisis that creates backlogs in the areas of work that are temporarily neglected.  If those backlogs get too big, it can create a chronic situation of always being behind and trying to catch up.   It doesn't necessarily mean you are overcommitted -- it may mean you need to anticipate these spikes in activity better, and manage them better.  <br><br>(Vegheadjones -- if you happen to see this -- you're the only other person who posts here regularly whose lists have been the same magnitude as mine -- is your work similar to this at all?)</div>

<div>Replying to Sarah Jane's concerns about losing ideas if I don't write them down.<br><br>If it's something I know has to be done or an incredibly great idea, I write it down. If I don't write it down, the worry about forgetting it interferes with my deep work. Enough detail but no more, in the notebook I carry everywhere. Putting it in the right project folder, or even further evaluation, is for later. (When I open a file, I also scan my notebook for relevant notes, crossing them off as I move them to the file. Every so often I move the rest of the notes to the right folder and tear the pages out of the notebook.)<br><br>The goal is a snapshot. Yes, the temptation is to expand on the idea. The next step is on the tip of my tongue, a few more seconds so I don't forget it. And the next...and the next...<br><br>If it's that easy to expand on the idea now, then it will be easy later. And I have a toolbox full of ways to expand. Mark's repeated questioning technique is the newest.<br><br>Also, when reviewing those ideas, remember: I wrote it down because it was interfering with the deep work, not because it was a great idea. Evaluating it is a later step.</div>

<div>Will's Water Bottle<br><br>Back when I worked outside the home, my home voice mail often had messages like, "Remember to bring book for coworker." Work got messages like, "Remember to bring home water bottle for washing." In the morning, I'd put a note on my briefcase, "Take home waterbottle for washing."

Here are a few pointers/questions/thoughts which probably won't add up to a definitive answer:<br><br>1) For me the question at the heart of it is "What do you actually do?" By which I mean if you wrote down every single thing you do during the week what would it consist of? (I don't actually want to know the answer, just for you to think about it!)<br><br>2) And then my second question is: "Is what you actually did during the week satisfactory?" In other words, did you do enough of the right things?<br><br>3) If the answer to Question 2 is "yes", then it doesn't really matter how you got there. Maybe having a huge list and a certain amount of resulting stress is just what your brain needs in order to be creative and effective. As long as the result is ok, it's fine (from a time management point of view anyway).<br><br>4) If the answer is "no", then you need to think seriously about the fact that writing everything down is not producing the right answers, so it is probably not the right way to go about it.</div>

<div>Mark,<br><br>My meditation teacher (and several books and friends with more experience) say the same thing. I find it works when meditating, but not so much when working.<br><br>When meditating, I trust my subconscious to remember important things like commitments I haven't recorded, and the core parts of any worthy ideas. Meditation is, in part, training my brain to focus or observe or let go. (Varies with type of meditation; my teacher believed in filling the toolbox, and exploring similarities and differences.)<br><br>Five months after the class, I've experimented enough to know he's right. Mostly. Still some fear (and the opportunity to meditate on the fear, and to welcome and listen to it without acting).<br><br>When doing deep work, or even housework, I don't (yet) trust my subconscious with commitments, but am becoming comfortable trusting it with "great ideas" that I'm not as worried about forgetting.</div>

<div>Will, can you leave lime juice at work? And maybe cleaning equipment. (Thinking back to one office, nope, wouldn't trust the wash cloth or fridge.) (I did co-op at Waterloo. Alternated school terms with work terms for 5 years, so six work terms, all somewhat related to my field. Many different offices and teams. Great experience.)</div>

<div>Seraphim,<br><br>I'm currently experimenting with multiple lists rather than one list to serve many purposes.<br><br>During the day, 5T. More like 3-7T right now. Some tasks do better in groups, but I prefer to list each item rather than just the chunk. (More chance to reward self with checkmark. Less chance of ignoring one. More chance to reinforce the routines I want to develop.)<br><br>Evening / Morning list. My big rocks and big worries for the day. Spend some time listening to my subconscious so it can tell me about things. Also reassure subconscious that the rocks won't be forgotten. As my subconscious learns to trust me, it's more willing to wait for its turn, rather than interrupt me during meditation or deep work. And I'm more willing to trust it to repeat the reminder at the right time.<br><br>Week list. Everything for the week, while planning the week. The purpose is to see how busy the week will be, so I list routine things. Here I'll chunk things rather than list them out.<br><br>Tickler list. Variety of pages, depending on time frame and level of detail.<br><br>Hibernation list. Putting something on the hibernation list is formally telling myself I'm not allowed to work on it until I drop something else. For me, that works better than deleting something. I rarely review this list. The last time I looked at it, I wondered why I had so much trouble letting go of the projects. It was a learning experience.</div>

<div>Seraphim:<br><br><< Why not just keep the water bottle at work? I keep mine an arm's length from my keyboard at work. >><br><br>Because Will has already said it's a long way from his work point to the nearest water source. I imagine that also applies to a spot where he can dispose of the water. If he has to take the water bottle from his desk to the water source/disposal and back again he will be wasting time. But if he has the bottle on him when he arrives and departs he will pass by them on the way in and out.<br><br>This is getting to be like one of those puzzle books to keep you entertained on plane journeys!</div>

<div>Cricket:<br><br><< When doing deep work, or even housework, I don't (yet) trust my subconscious with commitments, but am becoming comfortable trusting it with "great ideas" that I'm not as worried about forgetting. >><br><br>The ways of our memory are strange, aren't they? I discovered years ago that if someone phones me with a message for my wife, I will always forget to tell her unless i both write it down AND put it in her in-tray. Then the second she comes into the house I will say "There's a message for you from Jane asking if you can meet her tomorrow at 10". But if I write a note to myself to tell her, I am bound to forget and will only find the note when it's too late!</div>

<div>Seraphim:<br><br>Your experiences with no-list are very similar to mine - except that I don't seem to suffer from that feeling of intensity. Maybe that's because I don't have bosses etc breathing down my neck.<br><br>One thing I am finding is that no-list seems to make my mind far more disciplined and less prone to giving way to resistance. I'm convinced that it actually makes changes in the way my brain is organized!</div>

<div>Cricket - <br><br><< Evening / Morning list … Week list …  >><br>These kinds of lists work for me best if I write them all down, maybe sort them, think about them.  And then maybe choose the "top five" and that becomes my 5T list.   And then throw the rest away immediately.   Otherwise these lists essentially become "catch-all" lists in another form.   <br><br>The two supplemental lists that are working well for me  (and not turning into catch-alls) are:<br>(1) overall project/commitment list - about 7-10 items<br>(2) list of specific deliverables, usually with a deadline, that I need to remember<br><br>I also have supplemental lists for *specific projects* and *specific meeting agendas*.   But really, those are detailed project files -- not time management lists.<br><br><< Tickler list >><br>I use my calendar for that, or perhaps an Outlook reminder attached to an email.  Either way I suppose it serves the same purpose.<br><br><< Hibernation list >><br>This sounds like my "ideas for later" list.   And your experience is similar to mine.  I've taken to filing these in my general catch-all time-based filing system -- probably never to look at again.  But filing it (rather than deleting it) appeases that nagging worry "but what if I forget that great idea!!" and gets it to shut up.   I've found this more effective than using brute force / self-reproach to get that inner voice to shut up.</div>

<div>Seraphim:<br><br><< I'd love to hear more about your thoughts on this connection, Mark!  >><br><br>Something struck me in connection with my anecdote about how I always remember to tell my wife when I've left a message for her, and always forget to tell her if I only write a note for myself to tell her. That is that when I leave a message for her I have actually done something, rather than just having thought about doing it.<br><br>This ties in with my experience that with no-list I don't forget the projects I'm actively engaged in.

<div>Thanks to all for the comments on the water bottle saga.<br><br>Mark,<br><br>Yes: when I found the bottle, I should immediately have carried it to the bag and put it in. At that stage, I thought I that I had won the battle and that having it out and visible would be enough. I had not realised how implacably my inner lizard was working against me. At least I had the excuse of honest ignorance.‘There must be a begynnyng of any great matter, but the contenewing unto the end untyll it be thoroughly ffynyshed yeldes the trew glory.’<br><br>The next day, I should have thought this through. Even with the suboptimal, checklist, strategy, I should have realised that trusting my brain for something like this was a mistake.<br><br>Now I have got the bloody thing to work, it's staying here!<br><br>Seraphim,<br><br>"Why not keep the water bottle at work?" <br><br>I fully intend to (see above). But first, I had to get it here.<br><br>(Mark, the walk to the water cooler is a useful five minute break. Fine for once an hour or two. But enough to dissuade me from refilling when I've finished a cup.)<br><br>Cricket,<br><br>I keep a carton of orange juice at work, which serves the same purpose. Though it's really a nice to have. It ran out yesterday and I'm not stressed that I'm drinking unadulterated water.</div>

<div>I am bumping up this thread. <br>Here Mark Forster is giving tips on avoiding overcommitment using a catch-all list. <br><br>1. Authorized Project List<br><br>2. Stringent evaluation of tasks before writing them down<br><br>3. Limit on the number of tasks on the list<br><br>4. Limit on the estimated time it will take to do the tasks on the list</div>
