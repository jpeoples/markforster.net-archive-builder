<h1>What this website contains</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2008-01-8 10:13</div>
<div class="content"><p>It’s too early to assess the results of the request I sent out yesterday about the future of my newsletter, but one fact is coming out very clearly - most people have very little idea of what is available on this website.</p><p>There are <strong>over 200 articles</strong> on every aspect of time management, personal organisation and achieving goals. The website acts as an archive for <strong>every article</strong> I’ve written which still has some currency.</p><p>How can you access this information?</p><p>If you’re looking for a specific article or subject, then use the <a href="/display/Search?searchQuery=&moduleId=1292867">Search Box </a>at the top of the left margin. This is fast, accurate and completely up-to-date (if you don’t believe me then try searching for any word that appears in this posting). You can search by category if you want to narrow it down further.</p><p>However the key to the articles is the <a href="/blog-archive/">Blog Archive link </a>in the Navigation section in the left margin. This gives all the entries by Category, by Title, by Week and by Month.</p><p>Also in the left margin you will find links to the <strong>Most Popular Articles</strong>.</p><p>Happy browsing!</p></div>

<div>Hi Mark,  If your using an RSS feed eg Google Reader you can see all the old blogs AND if you use Google Notebook you can save portions of the blogs you find interesting.  It indeed is a Google world!</div>

<div>Yes, but... my review of Diigo v. Google Notebook may not entirely agree with you!</div>
