<div class="content"><p>Nothing to report on my diet.</p><p>That's quite unusual, isn't it? Aren't diet reports supposed to be full of moans about hunger, confessions about bingeing, and alternating despair and elation about the latest weigh-in?</p><p>No, sorry. None of that. I seem to have got used to the amount of food necessary to keep more or less to the target weight. Occasionally I have to use a rule or two, but basically it's just steady progress downwards and I eat what I feel like.</p><p>Very boring -  I need some drama to keep the readers coming!</p><p> </p><p><em>Full details of the diet I am following can be found </em><a href="/blog/2006/12/4/can-i-improve-on-the-no-s-diet.html"><font style="color: #0072bc" color="#0072bc"><u><em>here.</em></u></font></a></p></div>
