<h1>Feedback from the One Day Seminar</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2007-10-16 11:08</div>
<div class="content"><p>Here are the comments from the One Day Seminar which I ran on Thursday last week:</p><p>“Amongst the most worthwhile uses you can make of a day that you’re not able to spend outdoors. Mark Forster has genuine insight and wisdom, in contrast to the many impractical and complex ‘systems’ on offer. Superb.” <br><strong>Perry Duke, Head of Finance Control Division, DEFRA, </strong><a href="http://www.perryduke.org/"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">www.perryduke.org</span></strong></a></p><p>“A good way to crystalise the book. Now I have consolidated <em>Do It Tomorrow</em> I am looking forward to applying it.” <br><strong>Aaron Pascoe</strong></p><p>“Great value, really good to be able to bring the fantastic ideas in the book to life”. <br><strong>Iain Gray, Win More Clients </strong><a href="http://www.winmoreclients.co.uk">www.winmoreclients.co.uk</a></p><p>“I am optimistic that I will implement the DIT structure. Many useful ideas”. <br><strong>Pauline Hay</strong></p><p>“Very useful in terms of learning about practically applying the DIT system”. <br><strong>Frank Wessely</strong></p><p>“It was very good to meet you and pick at my own personal issues with keeping going on the DIT system.” <br><strong>Mark Jameson</strong></p><p><strong>There are still places on the next seminar this Friday, October 19th. <a href="/seminars/">Click here for details.</a></strong></p></div>
