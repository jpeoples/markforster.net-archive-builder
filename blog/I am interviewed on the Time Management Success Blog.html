<h1>I am interviewed on the Time Management Success Blog</h1>

<div class="content"><p>Tim Wilson has put an <a href="http://www.time-management-success.com/superfocus.html">interview with me</a> on his Time Management Success blog. It covers some of the factors that went into the development of Do It Tomorrow, AutoFocus and SuperFocus.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think good time management system has got to achieve two things. It’s  got to optimise the sequence in which tasks are done, and it’s got to  keep the person doing the tasks in “the flow”.</p>

    <p>The second comment on the interview post on Tim’s blog is signed “Seraphim”. Although it is I believe his real name, he is not the same person as Seraphim on this website.</p>

<div>As a long time user of Autofocus and avid reader of the discussion forums I never picked up on using Autofocus to make choices such as listing both "buy red notebook" and "buy blue notebook" which Mark Forster mentions in this interview.  I love the idea of this new facet (to me) of using Autofocus to make choices and am going to try this idea right away.  I had been using the method of entering "Buy notebook?"  with a question mark and acting on it when it stood out but acting on one of 2 (or more) competing choices is very interesting indeed.  Thank you.</div>

<div>I really liked this analogy:<br><br>"What is the difference between a swamp and a river? The water in both is exactly the same water, and in both it's behaving the way water behaves. The difference is in the surrounding structure. In exactly the same way humans will behave in the way humans behave, and the difference is in the structure. Systems are very important parts of structure."</div>

<div>What a wonderful summary of the "Mark Forster brand"! Emailing that interview link is a great way to introduce friends to these ideas.</div>

<div>Thanks Mark!<br><br>You summarized good two criteria for effective time management.<br><br>I have noticed couple of criteria which are essential for good time/task management system good (disclaimer: this is *just* my opinion)<br><br>1.) minimal overhead. This means: no difficult installation/setup, and no extra work<br><br>2.) user is happy and motivated. This means that proessing tasklist etc is comfortable<br><br>3.) Results. you simply get things done. Not just polishing and finetuning the  your "system" ....<br><br>Superfocus is so far becoming optimal (at least) for my needs!!<br><br>BR, Vesa P.</div>
