<h1>Archive of Past Articles</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2006-10-6 10:12</div>
<div class="content"><p>I am going to start a big project over the next few days of tranferring the whole archive of my past articles into this blog (predated so they won't get in the way of new entries). There are well over 100 articles, though some of them may be a bit out of date now and need weeding.</p><p>I used to keep this archive in yahoogroups. The archive had a high Alexa rating of its own, so I hope this will prove to be a popular resource.</p><p>Keep coming back to this site, because you should find something new every time you do.</p></div>
