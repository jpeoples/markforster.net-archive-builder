<h1>Monthly Newsletter Delayed</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2016-07-4 12:25</div>
<div class="content"><p>My monthly newsletter was due to be published at 11 a.m. UK time today. Unfortunately last night we had a major flood at home when a pipe burst and we were unable to turn off the mains water supply. Dealing with the aftermath of this means that it may be a few days before I can publish the newsletter.</p></div>

<div>Thanks, Lenore. I hope it won't be too long before back to normal.</div>

<div>I don't mean to sound heartless, but how about a very short, closed NL-FVP:<br><br>Deal with flood.<br>Write and publish newsletter.</div>
</div>

<div>Thanks, everyone. The list of things to do under the general heading "Deal with Flood" is rather long!</div>

<div>Ha! "A flood ate my homework".<br><br>That sounds horrible, like something from Das Boot. <br><br>I hope that the flood hasn't damaged anything irreplaceable, that the insurers leap into action with alacrity rather than bureaucracy and that Mick Cool's smooth efficiency glides over this temporary glitch.<br><br>Looking forward to seeing the newsletter when the time is right, and not before.</div>

<div>I join everyone else in wishing you well!<br><br>It's when this kind of thing happens (who *plans* for water damage?) (I speak as a homeowner who has suffered through two separate but destructive water incidents) that you really appreciate the routines, the systems, the habits, etc. Because so-called 'normal life' is disrupted and all you can think about is the next few hours, then the next few days, and so on.<br><br>We had a break-in last year that had us in a kerfuffle for a few days, and then the reconstruction (and dealing with the city) led to months of plans, pictures, getting quotes for replacement window,  etc. I was very grateful to have spent hours setting up systems for computer backups, handling email, accommodating impromptu projects, etc. so that I could contain that disruption to a 'project' that could at least be minimally managed.</div>

<div>Thanks for the good wishes from all. We're pretty well back to normal running, apart from ruined carpets (upstairs and downstairs), some electrical problems and soaking wet walls. It seems pretty certain that we'll have to move out at some stage for a couple of weeks while it's all sorted. But until the assessors have submitted their reports and the insurance company has decided what to do, we don't have anything definite.</div>

<div>Sorry for your troubles. Glad to hear the damage is limited to wiring, walls, & floors. Much better than losing lives & treasures (keepsakes). Hope the insurance pays adequately and the renovations don't drag out beyond summer.</div>
