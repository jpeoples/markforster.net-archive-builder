<div class="content"><p><span class="full-image-float-none"><img style="width: 703px; height: 301px" alt="Qlockwork.jpg" src="/storage/Qlockwork.jpg"></span></p><p>Yesterday I downloaded an interesting program called <a href="http://www.workingprogram.com/qlockwork.html" class="offsite-link-inline" target="_blank">Qlockwork</a>, which keeps a record of everything that you do on your computer. It's a useful way to see the reality of how you are spending your time.</p><p>The picture above shows the last hour of work for me yesterday. First I was doing some work on my blog, followed by a gap while I nipped to the shops for something, then a bit more on the blog, a short session with QA-Coach, and finally backing up my computer. My computer was switched off at exactly 6 o'clock in accordance with my new Structuring the Day rules.</p><p>I just ran the program and it did all this by itself. I haven't even glanced at the instructions yet. There's loads more one can do with it, so I will be exploring its capabilities over the next few days.</p></div>
