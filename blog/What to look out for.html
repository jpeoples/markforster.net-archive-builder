<h1>What to look out for</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2012-01-15 16:06</div>
<div class="content"><p>I’ve posted several times that I am nearing completion of the development of the Final Version, and each time further problems have surfaced and the completion has been put off. This hasn’t been a question of procrastination - simply of getting it right.</p>
<p>So rather than post yet again to say that I feel I’m nearly there, I thought I’d give you some indicators so that you can tell for yourself how near I’m getting.</p>
<p>Watch out for these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Daily blog posts</li>
<li>Revival and reorganization of my newsletter</li>
<li>A reduction in my personal activity on the Discussion Forum.</li>
<li>Changes to the website</li>
<li>A new programme of seminars</li>
<li>New initiatives (such as videos, teleconferences, partnerships, etc)</li>
<li>An increase in external interest</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m not saying that all of these will necessarily happen, but when you see several of these signs then you will know that the day is nigh!</p>
<p>Until you do, you can be pretty sure that it isn’t.</p></div>

<div>Mark,<br><br>Autofocus this, superforcus that, final solution, no really the *final* solution, honest, I'm nearly there, I'm *really* nearly there, I'm, ....<br><br>There comes a point where repeated failed attempts to solve a problem should lead the thoughtful person to conclude that the failure lies in their specification not of the solution but of the problem.<br><br>Don't you think you have now reached that point?</div>

<div>According to the inventor of WD-40, "WD" stands for "Water Dispersal" and "40" is the number of attempts he made at the formula before he got it right.</div>

<div><<An increase in external interest>><br><br>Does that mean:<br><br>1. there will be increased interest in Mark's work from people who are new to his website, or<br><br>2. Mark will have increased interest in activities other than his website?</div>

<div>moises:<br><br>It means that you may see more mentions of my work on other websites, etc, because I will be publicizing it.</div>
