<h1>Update on Autofocus Dismissal Rules Trial - Day 2</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2021-06-25 1:06</div>
<div class="content"><p>At the end of the day, I have 9 Full Pages of which two have been completed.</p>
<p>That represents 297 tasks, of which 207 tasks have been done and 90 are undone.</p>
<p>Two tasks have been highlighted yellow under <a href="../blog/Autofocus 1 New Dismissal Rule Trial.html">the new rules</a>,</p>
<p>I’m amazed at how much work I’ve got done in a day and a half.</p>
<p>It’s too early to say how much effect the new rules are having, but my impression so far is that the system feels much easier and relaxed than the original AF. I’m sailing through the work.</p></div>
