<h1>The Blank Canvas - Day 2</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2016-06-3 7:00</div>
<div class="content"><p><em>Thursday</em></p>
<p><em>10.30 a.m.</em> It’s the same time of day that I started feeling that I’d done everything yesterday, and it’s just the same feeling now except that today I got up an hour later. So the improvements I noted yesterday have had quite an effect.</p>
<p><em>10.30 p.m. </em>I felt I was losing focus during the afternoon, so switched to a “tighter” no-list method, the one I described in my post on <a href="../blog/My Current No-list System.html">May 9th</a>. It was my original intention to stick to the same system throughout, but in fact it’s one of the advantages of no-list that one can change systems mid-stream without causing a problem.</p>
<p>I’ve got a few points about the order in which I’ve been doing things in the morning which I want to change tomorrow.</p></div>

<div>May 9th system is my favorite, and I use it frequently.</div>

<div>Mine too! The May 9th system is helping me experience leaving work with everything crossed off. I've so rarely felt that in 27 years of work. <br><br>The funny bit is that all the stuff I used to fret about are mostly work that I would create for myself. My co-workers are getting everything they need from me, and I'm also moving a couple key personal projects forward. I'm just not stressing about all the "value-add" things that I don't have time to do. I will get to the other projects later (or not). But I won't worry about them because I didn't have time to do them anyway! The only thing I found time to do was write them down over and over and worry about how I wasn't moving them forward. <br><br>Another surprising benefit. When someone asks for my time, I am totally available! I used to look at my long undone list and think "argh, I can't afford to give them my time right now". Now I look at my list, see 1 current task and maybe a couple rewritten, and I am able to fully give them my attention. I'm even finding I can drop everything when opportunity strikes! It's remarkable.</div>
