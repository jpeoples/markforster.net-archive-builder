<h1>Review of the Systems: DWM (Day, Week, Month)</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2011-01-26 18:43</div>
<div class="content"><p>The full instructions for the system can be found by <a href="../blog/DIT2 AF5 Who cares what it's called This is what I'm working on at the moment....html">clicking here</a>.</p>
<p><em>Brief Summary</em></p>
<p>Unlike the Autofocus methods the DWM system makes the dismissal process the key. The system uses a page-a-day diary. New tasks are entered one calendar month from the current date (e.g. if today is 26 January, new tasks are entered on 26 February). All re-entered tasks are entered one week from the current day. All pages older than the current day are deleted together with any remaining tasks on them.</p>
<p><em>Advantages</em></p>
<p>The automatic dismissal after one month for new tasks and seven days for re-entered tasks concentrates the mind. It also encourages the little and often approach.</p>
<p><em>Disadvantages</em></p>
<p>The use of a page-a-day diary is rather clumsy. It is difficult to keep the two entry points clearly marked. The automatic timed dismissal is rather a blunt instrument, and doesn’t provide a good fit for many tasks.</p>
<p><em>Conclusion</em></p>
<p>The problems with using a page-a-day diary are solved in DWM2 - see the<a href="../blog/Review of the Systems DWM (Day, Week, Month) 2.html"> next review</a>.</p></div>

<div>Mark,<br><br>Here's another disadvantage that you didn't list: <br>The re-entry of tasks one week from today is arbitrary and may not fit real world work.<br><br>Matt</div>

<div>Matt:<br><br>If you mean that the page-a-day diary does not act in the same way as the Task Diary in DIT, you are right. But I don't see it as a disadvantage because the diary is intended purely to keep track of the automatic dismissal.</div>
