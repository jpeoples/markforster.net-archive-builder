<div>It's unfortunate but it had to be done. I'd say it's a good move. Please everyone sign up as this forum can still use your participation. <br><br>And it's nice to see Mark's last post is no longer about procrastination ;-)</div>

<div>No, there isn't. But if there's anything you really need to change, you can make another posting asking me to make the edit. Or you can email me.</div>
