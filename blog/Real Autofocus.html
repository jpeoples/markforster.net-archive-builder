<h1>Real Autofocus?</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2017-07-19 15:37</div>
<div class="content"><p><em><a href="http://fmblg.blogspot.co.uk/2017/07/real-autofocus-nouvelle-methode-de.html">French translation</a> by Fred Mikusek</em></p>
<p>This method of dealing with a task list is the <a href="../blog/High Volume, High Speed, Low Resistance - Final Test Result.html">most effective</a> I have yet found. It is based on simple scanning, that is to say going round and round the list doing tasks as and when they stand out.</p>
<p>This is in itself quite an effective method, but as I said <a href="../blog/High Volume, High Speed, Low Resistance - 5.html">here</a> it suffers from two major related problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>The list tends to grow uncontrollably</li>
<li>It gets spread over a large number of pages if you are using a notebook and pencil/pen. </li>
</ol>
<p>So what one ends up with is a huge backlog of tasks, which one doesn’t have a hope of ever clearing.</p>
<p>What is needed is a way of getting the list to self-limit in such a way that it focuses on what one can actually do within a couple of days or so.</p>
<p>Here’s how it works step-by-step. I’ve assumed you are using paper and pen/pencil, but it is easily adapted to work electronically. </p>
<p><br>FIRST DAY </p>
<ol>
<li>Start a new list. Don’t use an existing list.This is very important, otherwise you will overwhelm it before you’ve even started.</li>
<li>Add other tasks to the end of the list as needed or as they occur to you throughout the day. Allow the list to build up gradually.</li>
<li>Work the list by scanning it, taking action on those tasks that feel ready to be worked on.</li>
<li>When you’ve worked enough on a task. cross it out. If it’s unfinished, re-write it at the end of the list. Do the same with tasks that will recur the same day or the next day.</li>
<li>When you finish for the day draw a short horizontal line in the margin immediately after the last task on the list.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p>SECOND DAY</p>
<p> </p>
<ol>
<li>Starting from the beginning of the list work as in rules 2-5 for the First Day.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>SUBSEQUENT DAYS</p>
<p> </p>
<ol>
<li>Extend the first of the two short line end-of-day markers (see rule 5) so that it goes right across the page.</li>
<li>Start working from that line (i.e. ignore any tasks before it for the time being)</li>
<li>When you reach the end of the list, go back to the beginning of the list.</li>
<li>You now work only on the tasks between the beginning of the active list and the long horizontal line you drew at the beginning of the day:<ol>
<li>Scan them and DELETE any you no longer want to do at all</li>
<li>Scan again and DEFER any you don’t want to do now to your schedule/calendar (do not just re-write them at the end of the list without taking any action on them)</li>
<li>DO all the remaining tasks in order</li>
</ol> </li>
<li>Continue working the rest of the list as in rules 2-5 for the first day.<ol> </ol></li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p>IN SUMMARY, at the beginning of each day you work on yesterday’s tasks in the normal way, followed by today’s tasks. Then you clear ALL tasks remaining from the day before yesterday (DELETE, DEFER or DO). Once you’ve done that you carry on working yesterday and today’s tasks as normal.</p>
<p>Using this myself I was surprised how few tasks I needed to delete or defer. The list seemed to conform almost automatically to the amount of time I had available. I’ll be interested to know if it works that way for you too.</p>
<p> </p>

<div>Would this work in a daily planner? I'm at the point where keeping a daily appointment book could work better for me, & it would be nice to integrate tasks like DWM did. That was the version that worked best for me in the past, but between how spread out the list got & not having many appointments I quit using a daily planner.</div>

<div>Quick question:<br>What happens if work on or finish the task from step 5 on day 2? Does day 2 become the new day 1?</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Martin Williams - 2017-07-19 20:30</div>
<div>In addition to DO, DELETE, DEFER, isn't there some justification for further option? I'm thinking of of what Alan Lakein calls the 'CZ' list. If you can't bring yourself to work on a task, but don't want to completely forget about it forever, you'd dump it there, and check it once a month, or whatever.<br><br>This is, of course DEFERRAL, but of an indefinite sort.</div>

<div>Martin Williams: <br><br><< If you can't bring yourself to work on a task, but don't want to completely forget about it forever, you'd dump it there, and check it once a month, or whatever.>><br><br>I suspect all you'd succeed in doing is creating a huge list of stuff you're never going to get round to. Exactly what this method is intended to avoid.</div>

<div>For the final task under SUBSEQUENT DAYS, "DO all the remaining tasks in order" - did you find it important that they be done "in order"?</div>

<div>Zane:<br><br><< did you find it important that they be done "in order"? >><br><br>I tried various ways of doing this. I found that that the knowledge that one was going to DO the tasks in order gave an overall greater sense of purpose which even affected the DELETE and DEFER stages.</div>

<div>I think this is an excellent idea, especially the way you've nailed the problem of uncontrolled growth in a simple way. <br><br>I do have another stupid question: Would you limit the contents of this catchall to actionable tasks, or would you also throw non-actionable things at it like ideas, new project possibilities, etc.?</div>

<div>"Once you’ve done that you carry on working yesterday and today’s tasks as normal"<br><br>This is basically an everyday loop? <br><br>Also, wouldn't it be great to use this with a daily journal on Evernote for example? And then use checkboxes are for the tasks. You'll review the previous day's journal entry, and the day before that, daily.</div>

<div>Remarkably this innovation is extremely similar to what I just read earlier today in "18 minutes" by Peter Bergman. (Highly recommend the book, time management is the subject, but the Todo list is a tiny part of his writing.).   Allow me to quote from chapter 25, "The three day rule":<br><br>[After filling out today's schedule from items on the the todo list] I review what's left on the list. If there are new items from today or the previous two days, I leave them....  But for everything else..., I do one of four things:<br>1. Do it immediately [most leftover things get finished in a flash once you actually start]<br>2. Schedule it [for a future date]<br>3. Let it go. [delete]<br>4. Someday/maybe. [the coward list for things you don't have the courage to fully delete]<br><br>Why did Peter add this rule? "...the probability — of a long list of items...  And that list will simply grow longer and more stressful — a continued reminder of what you aren't accomplishing— day by day.... This is where the three-day rule comes in."</div>

<div>@Alan Baljeu - I like the parallel you draw between this system and the Bregman one.<br><br>Peter Bregman's 18 Minutes is indeed an excellent read.  I think several principles in it complement Mark's system quite nicely, as it also provides some guidance on setting up areas of focus, which could then allow you to populate the to-do list in a way that is in alignment with goals/objectives you set out to achieve.<br><br>@Mark - Looking forward to testing your system, Mark!  Thank you for sharing it with us, and I hope that you are well!</div>

<div>As usual from Mark, this is brilliant. It combines what I liked about AutoFocus (do things as they stand out) with what I liked about DIT (get a grip on what constitutes "a day's work"). Starting my testdrive today, looking forward to see how it works for me!</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Christian - 2017-07-20 9:53</div>
<div>When you defer a task to your calendar/schedule, how do you handle the task in practice when the scheduled day comes?<br><br>Do you actually schedule a block of time and use this time to work on the task? Or do you add the task to the end of the list on the scheduled day? Do you then force yourself to do at least some work on the task on this day?</div>

<div>Yoyorast:<br><br><< How do you go about handling big goals with this? >><br><br>Every goal is made up of actions. This method is about handling actions. All the following are actions:<br><br>Plan<br>Think About<br>Discuss<br>Draft<br>Review<br>Research<br>Organize<br><br>And many other management type words</div>

<div>Hi Mark, <br><br>[Looking forward to test driving this after the forthcoming hols] <br><br>Re <handling big goals>: would you keep a parallel overall projects list, or would you advise/prefer leaving these to the intuitive process of the list?</div>

<div>Colin:<br><br><< Re <handling big goals>: would you keep a parallel overall projects list, or would you advise/prefer leaving these to the intuitive process of the list? >><br><br>I think it depends on your circumstances, Projects should be neither over-controlled nor under-controlled.

<div>Alan Baljeu:<br><br><< "The three day rule":>><br><br>I've not read the book so I'm I'm probably missing a lot of background, but I'm not so sure that the resemblances are as great as they appear at first sight.<br><br>For a start Bergman refers to "filling out today's schedule from items on the the to-do list". I'm not sure what he means by that but it certainly doesn't sound like what I'm advocating in my method.<br><br>Secondly, mine is a "two day rule" by his definition, not a three day rule<br><br>Thirdly he goes for do, defer, delete. I go for delete, defer, do. This is important psychologically.<br><br>And fourthly, a someday/maybe list? Just exactly what I'm trying to get away from!</div>

<div>The similarly between Bregmanns "3-day-rule" and Marks new system are in my opinion a perfect example that two experts, who are dedicated to the same topic, come to similar conclusions, without even knowing about each others work. Kudos to both experts.</div>

<div>In the end, you'll have a really long list with stuff you've completed, and it'll grow and grow (digital, using something like evernote). Is this the goal?</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Nordwind - 2017-07-20 12:29</div>
<div>@Yoyorast: As long as you do any of the tasks on your todo-list and not just stare at them, this is what inevitably will happen - no matter which method you use. But what prevents you from archiving/deleting old pages, on which no unactioned tasks are left?</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Yoyorast - 2017-07-20 12:53</div>
<div>@Nordwind, I already know what sets this apart from any other todolist or system.<br><br>I was talking about this "It gets spread over a large number of pages".<br><br>Say you've used this for a week, you'll be able to go back and view tasks you've completed right? And since you're deleting, deferring, or doing items from -2 days, there won't be any unactioned tasks.<br><br>And if you're doing this electronically, you might have one massive list in which you can view all tasks you've done right? And stuff won't be split up through pages like in a notebook.</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Nordwind - 2017-07-20 12:58</div>
<div>@Yoyorast: Why don't you use one Evernote note for every day, in which you write down only the tasks of this day? In this case you'll only have three active pages.</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Eric - 2017-07-20 14:30</div>
<div>Question - On day three - you start at the line and work towards the end.  Do you just evaluate each task in order and decide if it is ready to be done?  Or do you scan around over and over again until there is nothing left to be done before moving to the other side of the line?  <br><br>I am unclear as to what process gets you to the end of the list so that you can move to the beginning of the active list (other side of the line)<br><br>Thanks,</div>

<div>Eric - here's my own little cheatsheet with points I especially need to remember. If it's incorrect someone can correct me:<br><br>...at the beginning of each day you start by working on yesterday’s tasks in the normal way (work the list by scanning it), followed by today’s tasks (work it by scanning). Then you clear ALL tasks remaining from the day before yesterday (DELETE then DEFER then DO, in order). Once you’ve done that you carry on working yesterday's and today’s tasks as normal.</div>

<div>The process for the oldest tasks seems to be the most different from the dismissal process on other methods. Instead of automatically deleting or deferring the oldest chunk, or giving them a last chance to be done before deleting, you are considering each task individually for deletion, then the remaining ones for deferral, and then doing the rest. Also, the tasks are not allowed to get stale.<br><br>At first it seems like it would be more efficient to consider "delete, defer, do" on each task, but that is a different mental process than the one Mark recommends. Why would it make that much difference?</div>

<div>Mark, been trying your systems here, thanks for all your effort and sharing.<br><br>what do you suggest based on your experiences, do the list with pen and notebook or digitally?<br><br><br>thanks, thanks, alot<br>:)</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Mark Forster - 2017-07-20 17:41</div>
<div>Jessica:<br><br>"delete, defer, do" _is_ what I recommend. <br><br>The reason I chose that order is because deleting or deferring a task takes exactly the same effort regardless of the difficulty of the task, whereas doing a task takes more effort for a difficult task than it does for an easy task.<br><br>Therefore if you delete and defer first you are more likely to get a answers uninfluenced by the difficulty of the task. The tasks left to be done will be the ones that should be done.<br><br>If you put doing first, then your decision will be effected by the difficulty of the task. This will result in some tasks being done just because they are easy and others being deleted or deferred just because they are difficult.</div>

<div>Hi Mark<br><br>Thanks a lot for sharing your new system with us, I tried it today and it was great as all the tasks are fresh to me and I am quite motivated to work on the system. <br><br>However I have a question, are you seperating your list with work and non-work list? For example, I have a daily routine task "Cleaning my office table", which I will do it daily on my work day Monday to Friday. However on Saturday and Sunday, I will not go to office, therefore "Cleaning my office table" will be left on the list until Sunday. Such "Cleaning my office table" task will undergo the progress of "delete, defer and do" on Sunday, in this case, shall I defer such task to calendar on Monday and add back to the list?</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Jessica - 2017-07-20 18:25</div>
<div>I think was you suggest for the oldest tasks is to ask:<br><br>Delete? for the oldest tasks<br>--Task A--<br>Task B<br>Task D<br>Task Z<br>...<br><br>Defer? for the remaining tasks of this list<br>Task B<br>Task D--><br>Task Z<br>....<br><br>And then Do what is left<br>Task B<br>Task Z<br><br>As opposed to asking 3 questions of every task in that group:<br><br>Delete, Defer, Do?<br>Task A<br><br>Delete, defer, do?<br>Task B<br><br>Delete, defer, do?<br>Task D<br>....<br><br>Was I interpreting the instructions incorrectly?</div>

<div>Mark:<br><br><No, you do one pass through Yesterday and Today (treated as one), then you go back to the Day Before Yesterday at the beginning of the list and clear it using Delete, Defer, Do. Once it's clear, you circle through Yesterday and Today (treated as one) for the rest of the day. ><br><br>Do you always scan beginning to end of whatever section you are in?  and then return to the beginning?  I think this what you mean by circling - but not sure.</div>

<div>It surprises me that anyone would find OneNote confusing. I find Evernote puzzling because it doesn't appear to structure anything and I never get the hang of using a tag system. <br><br>OneNote meanwhile is nothing other than a 4-ring binder with tabs (labelling the sections and pages).  If you understand a binder with sections, that's all you need to understand OneNote.  There's no tagging or indexing or sorting, just pages.  Now using one page per task in a todo list is unique but it works because the tabs make all the items visible at once down the side of your binder. And then you get the advantage of keeping details with your task.</div>

<div>Hi,<br><br>i implemented this in Outlook Tasks, grouping by start date and sorted by created date.

<div>@ellie520: (dealing with work tasks during weekend)<br><br>- One way is having two separate lists as Mark suggested.<br><br>- Another way: On Sunday, copy (only the) Friday WORK tasks to today (=Sunday) list. With NON-WORK Friday tasks, deal normally via delete-defer-do. So the alternate sequence would be copy(work)-delete-defer-do(non-work). On Sunday you will probably not do any work tasks (which you put on today=Sunday list) but on Monday, they will be appropriately on "yesterday" list, which is what you want.<br><br>- Another alternative would be - on Sunday, deal with Friday tasks as: ignore (work-tasks) -delete-defer-do(non-work tasks). Mark ignored tasks somehow if you need. But there is no need as they are tasks which stayed uncompleted/unmoved in Friday list. On Monday, deal with them as part of yesterday (Sunday) list. On Tuesday, deal with them also as part of Sunday list (delete-defer-do). You can make a note in Sunday list so as not to forget.<br><br>This are of course two untried ideas, I will test them during this weekend as I want to mix work and non-work items in one list (I am working mainly from home) but I do not usually want to work during weekends.</div>

<div>(continuation of previous comment) Sorry for confusion, I did not realize that on Saturday, I will also have to deal with work tasks (Thursday delete-defer-do). I will do the same as suggested in both alternatives - either move them to Saturday list (but not working on them) or ignore (mark) them on Thursday list and on Monday I will consider them together with Saturday tasks (delete-defer-do).</div>

<div>ellie520 and daneb:<br><br>I am anticipating that handling Work tasks over the weekend will be relatively simple. Any Work tasks from Thursday that I still want to do and don't have to do tomorrow will be deferred to Monday or another day next week when I DELETE, DEFER, DO tomorrow (Saturday). During the day tomorrow when I scan the list I assume I won't feel like doing any or most work tasks from today (Friday), they won't stand out to me. When I DELETE, DEFER, DO on Sunday any Work tasks from Friday will be deferred to Monday or another day next week unless I feel I need to work on any of them.</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Mark Forster - 2017-07-22 1:15</div>
<div>If I were going to do one list for both work (5 day week) and personal (7-day week), I think the way I'd do it  would be the stalagmite/stalactite  method,  For those of you don't know what this is, you write personal tasks from the top of the page downwards and work tasks from the bottom of the page upwards (or vice versa). When they meet you delineate the boundary with some sort of distinctive marking.<br><br>On Saturday and Sunday you would just ignore any tasks on the Work side of the boundary and pick them up on Monday as if the weekend hadn't existed. Nothing difficult about that at all.<br><br>You aren't restricted to weekends either. Any days off work can be treated the same way.<br><br>What's more, it will work the other way round on those occasions when you are away from home on a work trip and can't do any personal stuff.</div>

<div>So how do you deal with semi-urgent stuff while you're in the "DO" phase of DELETE-DEFER-DO? The instructions say that you should finish everything from the day-before-yesterday before continuing to scan yesterday's and today's list, so just writing it at the end of the list will not really work. Even if you do only a little work on all DO-stuff from before yesterday it could take quite a while before you reach the end today's list.<br><br>I see several options:<br>* do urgent stuff as it shows up, just as in the original Autofocus (but that's tricky for semi-urgent things, when to decide if something is urgent enough to make you leave working the list).<br>* get in the habit of leaving as little as possible tasks on yesterday's list to avoid the problem altogether.<br>* start every day with a quick scan of yesterday's and today's list and immediately proceed to the tasks from before yesterday to get them cleared as early in the day as possible.<br><br>Mark, I assume you would advocate the second option? Any other suggestions?</div>

<div>Hi Mark, great new system!<br>I was wondering if you would be able to develop something, or expand this system for those who can't always clear the incoming tasks in a couple of days. I can see this system could create quite long lists of deferred tasks. A robust system to handle deferred tasks would be great...</div>

<div>MrBacklog:<br><br><<  I can see this system could create quite long lists of deferred tasks. >><br><br>So can I! <br><br>In fact the whole idea of the system is to keep your workload down to what you can actually do. So a long list of deferred tasks is self-defeating.<br><br><< A robust system to handle deferred tasks would be great. >><br><br>I think the easiest way to handle this would be to put a low limit on the number of tasks that can be deferred to a particular day. So if the limit were three a day, and one day you had 15 tasks you wanted to defer, then you would have to spread those tasks over five days (more if some of those slots were already filled).</div>

Get it right and a perfect system for getting everything done at the right time.<br>Lovely!</div>

<div>I spent one day using Real Autofocus and loved it! However, I have a project that requires large time blocks daily. Part of the reason I loved the process is because I didn't spend the necessary amount of time on this priority project. I am going to try rewarding myself with my RA list after completing a time block and will report back.</div>

<div>After reading all these comments, it's clear that there is a mixture of new-system enthusiasm and issues/concerns developing already with list growth, backlog, anxiety over delete vs deferral, etc. As usual, several folks have ignored Mark's instruction to start with a fresh list.<br><br>Confession: I haven't tried it yet.  I'm hesitating for two reasons:<br><br>(1) I prefer a synced app-based method (macOS & iOS), and haven't imagined how best to do it - seems better with a paper pad or notebook.<br><br>(2) I have inferred (perhaps incorrectly) that success with this system depends on being judicious about what one adds to the list, which seems antithetical to the catch-all nature of the AF systems in general.</div>

<div>Seraphim:<br><br>What I have found with this system is that the effect of DDD on the day before yesterday has been to keep it in balance. In other words it has the psychological effect of causing me to restrict the amount of work I put on the list to what I can reasonably expect to do.<br><br>Of course it's perfectly possible to break the system if one really tries, which is why it's so important to build up gradually until one reaches equilibrium. As I've already said I find I tend to stay within the range of 40-45 tasks on the list at the end of the day, but to be doing 70-90 tasks in the course of the day.<br><br><<  it's supposed to be a catch-all system, after all. >><br><br>Is it?

<div><< Is it? I don't recall having said that. >><br><br>It's in all the blog posts running up to the final one. For example, in the July 17th post:<br><< Bear in mind that I was trying to find a way of processing a “catch-all” list without ending up with a huge number of tasks spread over many pages of notebook. >><br><br>This seems to imply the system was intended to be a catch-all list.

<div>After working this system for a few days, I realized that the system pre-supposes that important tasks should be worked on at least every other day, or, if you want to keep the system in check without risking a lot of stuff on D-D-D, every day. You could tweak this by changing what you designate D-D-D, for example changing it to the day before the day before yesterday instead of the day before yesterday. Have you tried that, Mark? Or would it dilute important tasks too much?</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Nicole - 2017-07-23 21:30</div>
<div>Like Seraphim, I was under the impression from the blog posts leading up to the instructions that this would be a catch-all system. I think I'm already in the process of breaking this system by overloading it with too much tasks that I can't possibly complete within the next few days. But as Seraphim also remarked, my attitude towards the system already changes while working it, making me reconsider when I put something on the list if that's really something I want/need/have to be doing within a few days.</div>

<div>Ubi - yes, I'm doing RAF in my bullet journal. I don't list tasks as bullets under each day's page. Instead I dedicate pages to tasks. When I reach the end of a task page I turn to the next empty page and continue there. (I do this with all pages - day, project, calendar, data, etc.) This is one reason I like RAF - the task list is physically short and always close to the page I'm on.</div>

<div>@mcogilvie: how do you implement this in Things-3? I've been working with Things on and off for the past couple of years, upgraded to Things-3 recently, but I find the Today list not flexible enough for most of Mark's systems. How do you distinguish between tasks from today, yesterday, or earlier? You could use due dates for that, but that kind off defeats the purpose of a real due date.</div>

<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">tomcal - 2017-07-24 14:09</div>
<div>Nicole, Ubi,<br><br>I've been using Remember the Milk, along with IFTTT, for this and it has been working great.    I have the list sorted by date added, NEWEST on top.  You can certainly do it with OLDEST on top, but I've always preferred NEWEST on top.<br><br>Any tasks that I add to my list at night, I like to count as the next day's task.  So, each evening, at 7 PM (about when I pretty much stop doing and start relaxing) IFTTT sends a new task to RTM.  The task shows as "=== Tasks added before <Date> 7 PM ===".  That works as a great separator on my list.  <br><br>So, the top group of tasks is my Today list.  Any tasks I add immediately go to the top of that list.<br><br>The next group (below that line) is my Yesterday list.   <br><br>The last group is my Day Before Yesterday list.<br><br>I use a smart list in RTM to include all tasks due today and then all undated tasks.  The items due today (usually appointments - OR - tasks I've deferred to this day) show up first.  They MUST get done today and show up ABOVE Today's list.  I work on those throughout the day, along with Today and Yesterday.   <br><br>Then, I move into my Day Before Yesterday list. Deleting moves them off the list, of course.  Deferring also moves them off the list since they now have a due date and it is later than today.  Then I just Do the remaining items on the list.<br><br>I've really been enjoying Mark's new system using this method.</div>

<div class="comment-meta">mcogilvie - 2017-07-24 17:12</div>
<div>@Nicole: it's pretty simple to implement in Things 3. In addition to things I want to do, I have two marker items "-------" and "--------------------". Things defaults to putting new items at the top of the Today list rather than the bottom,  so the list works backwards from the way Mark described it. I started on the first day with the markers at the bottom and my todos above them. The next morning, I moved the short marker to the end of the list. On the morning of the third day, I moved the long marker to the location of the short marker, and then the short marker to the end of the list. You could just do what you would do with paper instead: check off the old long marker, lengthen the short marker, and make a new short marker, but there's no need. I defer todos using the standard "When" feature of Things 3, and they show up at the top of Today list on that day, and of course I then put the long marker below them. Stuff from the Inbox as well as items marked "Today" in the  Anytime section will also appear at the top of the list. So far, it's working very well. It's actually a bit scary.</div>

<div>Starting a RealAF trial in a free-form bound pocket notebook (Field Notes Graph grid). Haven't done analog task management in a long time. Keeping a notebook open has an immediate quieting effect on mind. I'm much less tempted to "check" my devices all the time. I scan the notebook and contemplate what needs doing and noting.  A slim pocket notebook isn't much of a burden to keep around - fits in the same shirt pocket with my iPhone.<br><br>Reading about folks' methods for implementing RealAF (or earlier systems) electronically is stressful; it brings up bad feelings of all the attempts I've made - with Things, Clear, Reminders, etc. - and sync-failure anxiety.

<div>I'm also doing this analog at work (via the ol' marble composition book) and at home (Field Notes, kept in my back pocket).<br><br>For work, I had previously invested a lot of time in the Linenberger system where the inbox is customized with an Outlook Tasks window that is customized to show hi/med/lo tasks. Creating tasks from emails is dead easy with this method.<br><br>But funny thing...The company upgraded my laptop so they had to take my old laptop away and give me a loaner, so I was without my customized Outlook for a couple days. I had to access my email via the Outlook web interface -- which doesn't support the custom outlook views. <br><br>In the interim, I started an RAF list. When I got the new laptop, all of my emails were there, of course -- but none of the Outlook task window customizations. <br><br>I chose not to go through the effort of doing all that customizing again. It just proved to me yet again that digital systems, for all their marvels, can be brittle and crumble quickly. (I also set up Linenberger's system for Toodledo, but I don't find the interface appealing and have never gone back to it after setting it up.)<br><br>Pen and paper to the rescue! Just pausing for a few beats to write something down offers time for a little reflection, something I never did when dashing off new tasks.<br><br>Though my manager threw a task at me after lunch today that basically wiped out my afternoon, such that I never finished a round through yesterday and today and did not get to the DDD. So I will pretend like yesterday did not happen, and start again.</div>

<div>Perhaps I've missed something in the comments and replies, but I still think the weakness in this otherwise intriguing idea lies in the deferral process. It seems to me that one shoves deferrable jobs into arbitrarily-selected calendar slots. There no rule for it.

<div>Hello! I do not speak English, the translation was done by Google.

I named this list "Autofocus"<br>2. dueBefore:yesterday OR due:never. I named this list "DELETE DEFER DO".<br><br>In the settings of the program is the option "Default Due Date - "Today ".<br>When I look through the "DDD" list, the tasks that need to be postponed I set the "Today" date. They are automatically transferred to the end of the "Autofocus" list.<br>I'm testing the second day, the system works fine. It only needs 2 lists, which is very good.</div>

I was not doing the right tasks in the course of my day; and/or<br>b. I may have taken on too many tasks;<br>The system has been a revelation.

<div>Hi Mark, thank you for this new system. I've been experimenting it for a while now and I can say it works very well as a processing system. <br><br>However, after some experiments,  there is a concern I have which I want to share.<br><br>This is a bottom-up system, that is it allows to capture stuff that you are going to do over the next two days. Some of these actions may be connected to larger and important projects, but the risk is to 'flood' it with relatively low-important and low-resistance stuff. In other words, this system may become extremely effective at processing trivia. To me this was the main weakness too of all of your previous systems.<br><br>The solution would be to have a companion top-down system to keep track of projects in order to make decisions about the scheduling of highly important stuff that will be likely to get processed with the RAF, along with all the rest. <br><br>The only method of the kind that I have seen in your blog was the spinning plates. However, it didn't worked for me as a stand alone method. The main difficulty for me was to apply the "little and often" method, as my working days are really quite different from one another.<br><br>However, I will try to use both methods together over the next 10 days to see what happens.<br><br>in the meantime I was wondering whether you have other ideas in the pipeline regarding the management of projects...<br><br>Cheers</div>

<div>Mark:<br><br><<The secret is not to put low importance stuff on your list in the first place. Or failing that, to weed it out quickly and ruthlessly..>><br><br>Mark, my question is: how will you know that something is low-importance?<br><br>To me, I can say something is low-importance only in comparison to something that I believe to be more important in that specific time and space frame of reference. <br><br>In other words, importance of a task (or project, or whatever) is never an absolute concept, but a relative one. And the position of a task in this personal "importance scale" relatively to other tasks may also changes relatively to time and space. For instance, something that is very important now, may be absolutely unimportant tomorrow or in a place different from the one I am writing from now.<br><br>Therefore, what is still missing to me is a companion system, separate from the processing system, that will help us to reassess, quickly, creatively and on a regular basis, the importance of the stuff that is on our plate at any given moment and place. This system should help us to keep the focus constantly on what is located high in our personal importance scale, making it less vulnerable to external events that may distract us and cause a loss of focus.<br><br>Then, to choose what to put in the RAF (that, by the way, I think is the best of your processing system so far) will be very easy. And, at the same time, to have a clear and updated picture in mind of what is important now will reduce the chances that any kind of garbage that comes in along the day (especially the very urgent but low-importance ones) will be put reactively in the system to be processed.<br><br>I hope that I managed to speak my mind clearly.</div>

<div>Fabio:<br><br>I use Mark's suggestion of a commitments list to track all the mid to high level commitments I make or that are made for me at work. I phrase these commitments as projects, but sometimes they're more terse.<br><br>I keep the list in Evernote and have an automatic reminder set to review it every 2 weeks. At that point, I edit the list by bumping some projects "above the line" and moving lower priority projects "below the line." And reviewing the list may spark ideas for tasks.<br><br>I am not sure that this addresses your question. The best I can manage is to list what I think is important and review the list regularly in light of what time and Future Me judge to be still worthwhile.</div>

<div>Seraphim and Mark,<br>I read Seraphim's post where he was expressing concerns similar to mine.<br><br>What Seraphim described is rather known to me. When I am under pressure and there is a lot of new stuff coming in (maybe I am under stress also because of a lot of<br>stuff coming in), regardless of the system used, I tend to follow the path of least resistance. And I have noted that this is directly proportional to the amount of external pressure. So the higher the external pressure, the higher the tendency to shift away from the important stuff. <br><br>Being a Neurologist and being involved in clinical Neuropsychology I couldn't help comparing this kind of temporary behaviour to that of some persons with lesions of the so-called Supplementary Motor Area (SMA) which is located on the inner (mesial) surface of the frontal lobes, which in Humans are the planning and executive centers of the brain.<br><br>When there is a lesion of the SMA, there may be an imbalance in favour of another area called Pre-Motor Area (PMA) which is located on the external surfaces of frontal lobes.<br><br>PMA seems to be important to initiate actions triggered by external stimuli (like vision, hearing, etc - external drive system), whereas SMA seems more important to initiate actions on the basis of internal stimuli (i.e. visual imagery, thoughts, etc - internal drive system).<br><br>Normally the two areas are somehow in balance, so that we can start a course of action on the basis of we have imagined/planned in advance, thus the inner drive system (SMA) is prevailing. However, the plan can be updated-changed on the basis of an analysis of the external situation, so that the external drive system (PMA) can help making the needed adjustments to the original plan. The net result (behaviour) is the outcome of the continuous balancing between the internal<br>and external drive systems.<br><br>Although I have oversimplified the model, this is a very complex system that involves other important areas than the SMA and the PMA within the frontal lobes (by the way, there are two brain hemispheres, so that we all have two SMAs and two PMAs). Indeed the so called executive functions of the brain (including the two drive system described above and other important functions) require other important areas and neuropsychological functions to cooperate, such as working memory (a form of very brief short-term memory), long-term memory, prospectic memory (that form of memory that allow us to remember doing something at a specific time in the future), emotions, and, of course, the various forms of attention. The latter is particularly important as it  is the neural foundation of the ability to select (and discard unimportant) information in order to safeguard us from being helplessly immobilised into a standstill because of a flood of competing response demands.<br><br>When there is a lesion of the SMA, individuals become enslaved by external stimuli, so that they do not only lose the ability to plan, but they develop an urge to act on external stimuli, actually becoming <br>dependent on the external environment. They actually have extreme difficulties in inhibiting behaviours triggered by external clues, even if those behaviours are socially inappropriate. For instance, if they see some food they can reach out for it and eat it, not because they are hungry, but just because "the food was there".<br><br>By looking at my own behaviour under stress, maybe because of mental tiredness, loss of focus or, maybe, transitory memory malfunctioning or whatever, I have seen that my acting behaviour may be more prone to be influenced by external<br>demands (even trivial or relatively unimportant ones in comparison to my own pre-planned important goals), probably because stress moves the balance in favour of the external drive system (PMA overactive and/or SMA under active).<br><br>I have also noticed, that this happens to a lesser extent when I took the chance to "pre-load" into my own memory the plan for the day or, maybe better, those 3-4 main goals for the day and keep them afresh by recalling them (visually AND verbally) from time to time during the day. This gives me a sense of "calmness" and of being more in control that, probably derives from a better balance between the two drive systems in favour of the<br>inner one (SMA). It was like the formers would become better able to "filter" the information coming in from the environment, reducing the information "noise", thus allowing to keep the "inner" plan in focus.<br><br>This is, for instance, the main reason why, after many years, I have abandoned electronic means in favour of a more traditional pen and paper approach, as the act of writing (and, especially, rewriting) is, in itself, a memory aid.<br><br>In summary, in my experience, using only an executive device such as RAF (or its antecedent, like FV, SF, AF and the alike) may not be effective at reducing the risk of a takeover by the external drive system under stress. <br><br>On the other hand, the use of an executive device along with a companion system designed to reinforce the internal drive system by keeping the plan (or the projects) under regular (and quick) revision could help, under unfavourable<br>circumstances (i.e. stress), to keep the external and the internal drive systems in better balance.<br><br>Sorry for the length of the post, I hope that I haven't bored you to death too much... :-)</div>

<div>Hi Mike, <br>for the reasons explained in the post above, to make a review of the list of commitments (or projects) every two<br>weeks would be absolutely ineffective, unless you were able (and I am not) to keep that list afresh in your memory day by day. In this case, though, probably you wouldn't need to keep it in writing. <br><br>What I am saying is that if we all had, constantly loaded in our own memory, moment after moment, a list of our priorities, we would have less chances to get distracted from the supposed external urgencies and, thus, less prone to loss focus and to procrastinate.<br><br>However, for me this is not the case. Mark's previous system "the next hour of our life" for me was a complete disaster simply because I often could not remember the important stuff to be done, but only the external supposed urgencies, in view of the so-called "recency effect" of the memory (we tend to remember better things occurred closer rather than farther in time).<br><br>Thus, what I would like to use is a system that can be quickly reviewed several times a day to "refocus" on the priorities and quickly rebalance the external and the internal drive system in favour of the latter.<br><br>In this respect, RAF is an important advancement in comparison to the systems based on long catch-all list, because of the built-in two-days dismissal system, which inevitably forces to review what has not been done.</div>

<div>Mark, could you elaborate on how you use the "authorized project list" in actual practice? <br><br>You discuss a similar "authorized list of commitments" in the Secrets book (ch. 20, p. 124). <br><br>And you wrote about it here last year - <a href="../blog/Authorised Projects List.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2016/2/20/authorised-projects-list.html</a><br><br>The principles all make sense -- it's the actual practice that I'm wondering about.

<div>In a similar vein to what @Loukas wrote, you can also control the RAF task list length by having a set number of roles (Steven Covey, 7 Habits) or a six-box to-do list (Peter Bregman, 18 Minutes) and making sure that the RAF task list is populated only by 1-3 tasks from each role/box.  Using the Bregman-based approach has helped (?forced?) me keep the task list to a manageable length, on a daily basis.<br><br>Otherwise, the RAF approach has been a massive gamechanger for me - thank you Mark!</div>

<div>Hi Mark,<br><br>Thank you so much for your posts, systems and insights which are really helping me to avoid things like "analysis paralysis" and not knowing what to do when I have large blocks of unstructured time in between scheduled events or appointments.<br><br>With that said, I have begun implementing Real Autofocus in my daily work, but I have a question regarding Step 4 on Subsequent Days. It says:<br><br>You now work only on the tasks between the beginning of the active list and the long horizontal line you drew at the beginning of the day:<br>Scan them and DELETE any you no longer want to do at all<br>Scan again and DEFER any you don’t want to do now to your schedule/calendar (do not just re-write them at the end of the list without taking any action on them)<br>DO all the remaining tasks in order<br><br>When you say "do the remaining tasks in order", does that mean you need to finish them then and there? Or can you simply do some work on each (i.e. just make some progress) and then cross them off and re-enter them at the bottom of the list if they are still unfinished? (In other words, transfer them from "older" tasks to "still active" tasks.)<br><br>As a musician I tend to have quite a few medium- to long-term projects (writing music, practice etc.) on the go at once (running from tens to hundreds of hours of work) which can become organisational behemoths if I don't keep on top of them, but I may or may not be able to work on every project every day (due to my work often taking so many hours each day that I can only manage one or two musical projects per day out of the many), but still want to keep everything ticking over on a regular basis, as well as having time for personal projects and non-music related work or study. How does one manage something on this level?<br><br>I like the autofocus system as a way of managing my work according to my energy level and intuition, but how can I keep track of which tasks are part of a project or have been broken down into smaller tasks from a bigger one? I used to use a GTD system for this purpose but the downside was that I ended up doing far more organising than doing, and really not making an efficient use of my time, as I was putting off tasks due to not managing my energy levels well, tending to leave big tasks until far too late in the day to do anything meaningful about them. Thankfully, autofocus has redressed the balance somewhat but sometimes it's still difficult to see the forest for the trees. What might you suggest to deal with this?</div>

As you can enter anything that crosses your mind, focus on the important things, also, being able to see tasks you've completed really gives me focus, lots of energy, and motivation to get more and more stuff done. It feels like it's all being gamified (thanks to the weeding out rules) and that I'm a robot now. Lol.</div>

<div>Hi again Mark,<br><br>Thank you for your previous reply. In the time since I last posted, I've tried out some of your other methods (some other autofocus variants, DWM2 and a couple of "no-list" ones) and I always seem to find myself coming back to RAF as my weapon of choice for getting things done. <br><br>Now, instead of staring at a long list and wondering about priorities, how much time something will take, what to get started on and when, etc., RAF really alleviates the pressure I feel on a daily basis to actually get my brain started on focusing on work when my day begins, and after breaks in my day. I can just start my day by picking anything I feel like doing, and simply work on it for 5 minutes to kick-start myself. After that inertia is overcome, it's a lot easier for me to continue working.<br><br>With that said, I have a quick question.<br><br>You wrote in the main post in the SUBSEQUENT DAYS heading, under step 4:<br><br>You now work only on the tasks between the beginning of the active list and the long horizontal line you drew at the beginning of the day:<br>Scan them and DELETE any you no longer want to do at all<br>Scan again and DEFER any you don’t want to do now to your schedule/calendar (do not just re-write them at the end of the list without taking any action on them)<br>DO all the remaining tasks in order<br>Continue working the rest of the list as in rules 2-5 for the first day.<br><br>My question refers to the DEFER step, specifically to the "do not just re-write them at the end of the list without taking any action on them" part. If you have written something on your list that is actually more than one actionable step, or a "mini-project", is it OK to cross it out and rewrite it at the end of your list if you rephrase it in a way that makes it more actionable (for example, clarifying what is the first step in the process of doing that big task that is due for deferral). Does rephrasing a task in this way (breaking down a task into smaller chunks or the next actionable step) count as "taking action" on that task? Or must "action" constitute something more concrete than simply rephrasing a task?<br><br>Thanks for your time and help.<br>Ashley</div>

That's why I don't generally advise deferring tasks to the end of the list. But if you are satisfied that this will make it easier for you to do the task, then go ahead. If you find it doesn't work out that way, then you can have a rethink.</div>

<div>I have been learning this system for about a year now and reading all the posts. This is my first time commenting. Mark Forster, I love your system!<br><br>I used David Allen's technique for 20 years and never felt like I was doing it right. The AF system has been a revelation in that it combines intuition and a failsafe process. <br><br>This most recent RA iteration is the best for me. Here's one way to adapt it to an electronic system. I used to use Omnifocus, but now I use the "Things" app, which I find to be elegant and simple.<br><br>(btw, I capture tasks a few ways - via typing in the inbox, via emailing into "Things," and using Siri: "in 'things,' remind me to take out the trash." "'take out the trash' added to your inbox list!"<br><br>I created three "areas" in things: Today, Yesterday and Day Before Yesterday. <br><br>Then, I do your RA steps this way (this is starting w/ Day 3):<br><br>1. Work on “Yesterday.” When you reach the end of the list, go to “Day before yesterday.".<br>    1. Scan them and DELETE any you no longer want to do at all<br>    2. Scan again and DEFER any you don’t want to do now to your schedule/calendar (do not just re-write them at the end of the list without taking any action on them)<br>    3. DO all the remaining tasks in order<br>2. Continue working:<br>3. Add other tasks to the inbox as needed or as they occur to you throughout the day. Allow the list to build up gradually.<br>4. Work the 3 lists (today, yesterday, inbox) by scanning, taking action on those tasks that feel ready to be worked on.<br>5. When you’ve worked enough on a task. cross it out. If it’s unfinished, re-write it into the inbox. Do the same with tasks that will recur the same day or the next day.<br>6. When you finish for the day, move “yesterday” tasks to “day before yesterday,” “today” tasks to “yesterday” and “inbox” to “today."<br><br>I also have Areas for larger projects, and I make sure that one of my "to do"s is always "look at x project for next task." <br><br>In a nod to GTD, I also created a "waiting" area, for tasks I can't act on until I or someone else does something. "Check @wating" is one of my regular tasks.<br><br>And in another nod to GTD, I have an "Agendas" area, where I keep tasks related to specific important people, with a corresponding "check X agenda for tasks" item on my to do list. That way if I have a meeting or phone call w/ someone, I've got all the things I wanted to talk to them about in the same place.</div>

<div>Thanks, R. Perry, that’s what I didn’t understand was Inbox and Today. Today is an area not the built in Today?  When I read Mark’s rules again I saw how Today worked in the cycle.</div>

<div>Yes, Erin, I'm using "inbox" and "today" in the places in Mark's system where he refers to "today." It's just that I'm only adding new tasks to the "inbox" portion of it, since that's how it works with Siri.</div>

<div>I still use this system (sporadically) after several years, and was trying to recall the original instructions, regarding dismissal, by searching this site.  I even forgot what the R stood for!  It seems that this system never got entered on the TM Systems tab at the top.  I think this was the original entry - perhaps Mark can create a link from the TM Systems tab . . .</div>

<div>This seems like an excellent system. In thinking of any possible drawbacks, I have hit upon the following:<br><br>When you are clearing your delete, defer, do’s (DDDs), there may be urgent tasks clamouring for your attention. Obviously, the rule that allows for one pass through yesterday and today's tasks before the DDDs is meant to help with that. But it may not solve the problem.<br><br>Three potential solutions cross my mind:<br><br>1. Use to “do it now” rule to respond to the urgent tasks; or<br>2. Make sure that your DDD tasks are kept to minimum the day prior so that you won’t have a large backlog to clear while urgent tasks are coming in; or<br>3. Relax the DDD rule so that you only need to clear the DDDs by the end of the day, not in one go.<br><br>There are probably other solutions. And maybe I have exaggerated in my mind the extent to which this is a problem. I would welcome any thoughts on this.</div>

<div>I seem to have stumbled upon a possible solution to this issue, as posted here: <a href="../general_forum/DWM instructions and question.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2791587</a></div>

<div>Basically, DWM2 with 2-day dismissal is similar to solution 3 above. Every day, you get the whole day to clear all items from the day before yesterday--rather than having to clear them all in one go, as in the original Real Autofocus. Having the whole day seems a lot more flexible because urgent tasks will be coming in.<br><br>However, the original Real Autofocus may be better if it leads to solution 2 above: every day, you end up clearing most of yesterday's tasks, leaving very few DDDs to the following day. <br><br>Whatever is best, I'm attracted to this combination of Simple Scanning's flexibility + a time limit for the tasks so that you get moving on them. These features are common to Real Autofocus and DWM.</div>
