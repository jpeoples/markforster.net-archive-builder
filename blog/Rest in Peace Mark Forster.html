<p><strong>A Message from Mark Forster’s Son</strong></p>
<p>It is with deep sadness that I share the news of my father, Mark Forster’s passing. He died peacefully in his sleep late on Sunday, 12th October 2025, without pain.</p>
<p>For nearly a year, my father had been living with Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS), a condition that arose following two previous battles with cancer. In recent months, MDS affected his memory, making it increasingly difficult for him to manage his website.</p>
<p><em>Get Everything Done</em> has been a central part of his life since he published his first book over twenty years ago. He took great joy in the community that grew around it and was proud to play even a small role in helping others improve their lives.</p>
<p>On his behalf, I would like to thank everyone who contributed to <em>Get Everything Done - </em>whether through conversation, support, or shared ideas. Your presence meant a great deal to him.</p>
<p>Matthew</p></div>

<div>It is we who thank the inspiration and dedication Mark had over the years to constantly explore and engage with the community. I learned *a lot* here, since so much of his guidance resonated with me. Mark touched and influenced many, many lives with his work. He will be missed and remembered daily whenever I choose what to do next. My condolences to all his family and friends.</div>

<div>Thanks for relating the message.  I am sad to hear the news.  I am grateful to Mark Forster for his books, his forum, and his insights.  I have been impressed over the years with how much attention he gave to questions about the smallest detail.  I have been missing his comments for a long time, but still I was hoping that he would once again be able to answer our questions. He has been a coach and teacher for us.  I will miss him.</div>

<div>I don't think I've ever commented on here before but I've been a fan of Mark's ideas for a very long time. His willingness to try new things and experiment with time management systems was a great credit to him and a huge benefit to all of us who have followed him.<br><br>He will be greatly missed, rest in peace.</div>

<div>So sorry for your loss. Mark was a great inspiration to me. I still recommend his methods to anyone who feels overwhelmed, especially young adults. His patience and encouragement to try new things, to stick with experiments past the initial awkward phase, and to objectively measure the results, helped me immensely.</div>

<div>So sorry to hear this news. Praying for you and your family at this time of loss. Mark was such a giving person, and he helped so many of us on this site with his unique approach to getting things done. I still use his principles every day, both in my work and personal life.</div>

<div>Thank you so much, Matthew, for your kindness in posting this. Mark is a one-of-a-kind genius and has a profound influence on so many of us. I have missed his humour and his kindness this past year especially, he will always live in our memories. He was able to create a very unique and kind community here online as well, a model for other communities of like-minded individuals. May he rest in peace.</div>

<div>Thank you, Matthew, for sharing this. My condolences to you and your family. Mark’s work had a tremendous influence on how I approach productivity and manage my to-do lists. I even have an infographic I share about my current system that includes a quote from one of his books. Just the other day I was rereading one of them, looking for another passage that spoke to me. His ideas have shaped the way I work and think, and I’m deeply grateful for the impact he had on so many of us.</div>

<div>Mark's writing has greatly helped me in my quest to wrangle all the things. His experimentation and analysis of his ideas was a wonderful example for anyone looking to improve themselves. <br><br>I very much appreciate his prolific participation in the forums. He seemed a wonderful bloke!</div>

<div>Your father was a great help to me when I was trying to find ways to be more productive without a pile of filing folders that I never used. Not only was his writing helpful, but he even had time to chat with a complete stranger half a world away. (I’m another Canadian)</div>

<div>Thank you so much, Matthew, for letting us know about your father's passing. Just last night I was thinking of him, and contemplating returning to the system I created over a decade ago based on his "Do it Tomorrow" book, my favorite. Mark Foster's ideas, his willingness to continually experiment, and his lovely virtual presence will be remembered by many who read his books and frequented this website.<br><br>My condolences to you and your family.</div>

<div>As others, I haven't commented here before but I want to add my condolences to Mark's family and also my gratitude for Mark's "thinking out loud" about productivity and his keenness to help. I appreciated his willingness, even relish, in recognising weaknesses in an approach and working on improvements or trying new ideas. In a world of people claiming they can "change your life" and "smash it!", it has always been refreshing to come back to this calm, thoughtful place, and read Mark simply encouraging me to try new things and see what works for me.<br>Than you Mark and may you rest in peace</div>

<div>I’ve spent a lot of time on this forum talking about self-management and systems, but mostly I was curious about Mark’s thinking. Everything about him - his background in the military, coaching, family life, and religion - made him hard to pin down.<br><br>I read this news while once again mucking around with my own new “system,” thinking about what Mark would say. What he’d poke holes at...  what he’d encourage. <br><br>If there’s anyone from Toronto reading this, feel free to reach me at avrum AT nadigel COM. Maybe we can grab a coffee, share some stories about Mark, and trade notes on which pen and paper we’re obsessing over this week.<br><br>Matthew, may your father’s memory be a blessing to you and your family.</div>

<div>My heartfelt condolences to the family.<br><br>Mark was such an influential and original thinker, both widely recognized and, perhaps more importantly, quietly transformative in ways that are less visible but deeply felt by those who followed his work. <br><br>I don’t know how we will continue this quest without him, perhaps through a new circle or group to carry the spirit?</div>

<div>Very saddened to hear this news. Mark was a gentleman in an ungentle world and created and curated his corner of the internet to be civil and constructive. I have missed his active participation in the discussions here and continue to appreciate the group of contributors he gathered by virtue of his own character and his focus. His contributions live on in all of our lives. Rest in Peace.</div>

<div>My condolences to Mark's wife and family. I am very sorry to hear this sad news. I've been a reader of Mark's books and postings on here for quite a number of years. I would like to say how much I've enjoyed and appreciated his work and words. Thankyou Mark Forster, your insight will be much missed.</div>

<div>I never posted here, but I've been a frequent lurker for just about a decade. It's hard to put into words how much of an influence Mark and this community has had on my life. The way he boiled his systems down into simple rules clicked with my brain, and helped me survive college. After that, I'd continue coming back to see what new ideas he'd cooked up. I loved how down-to-earth and humble he was, always experimenting, sharing, discussing with others here, not claiming to be an all-knowing "guru." Mark's legacy will live on through all of us he has touched.</div>

<div>I was sad to read this post. Like many others here, I've stumbled upon countless productivity theories over the years, but I always found myself coming back regularly to this forum to learn about Mark's ideas. He was clearly very passionate about his work, and he will be greatly missed. <br><br>My heartfelt condolences to the Forster family.</div>

<div>I'm so sorry, thank you for taking the time to let us know. Mark was such an original thinker and the generosity of his time and sharing over the years has been extraordinary. I still remember browsing the bookshop where I found Get Everything Done and Still Have Time to Play. The title was just right. Mark surprised and delighted with new thinking, often so simple and so creative. Same again when 'Dreams' came out, then at one of his seminars on the early DIT system. By coincidence I picked up a notebook and pen a few days ago and went from electronic Simple Scanning back to original Autofocus. I remember the anticipation that Christmas all those years ago as Mark teased the new system, and then the joy of running with it. I've been re-reading the forum entries from back at the Autofocus launch and re-living the whole thing. I only knew Mark through his work, but I will miss him.</div>

<div>Matthew, my sincerest condolences to you and the Forster family at this very sad time.<br><br>Your father's time management ideas and how he shared them with others inspired me to test and tweak them in my own life and to do so with gratitude.<br><br>I'm sure there are many others like me who never met him in person but feel the loss of a kind and thoughtful coach/mentor.</div>

<div>Rest in peace Mark... You have shared so much wisdom and improved so many lives, without seeking awards or compensation. You have inspired all of us to be a little bit better, day by day, and that adds up to a lot. You will be always remembered. Thank you for all you've done for humanity.</div>

<div>In these sad news, it is a light to still see so much appreciation both ways! <br><br>Matthew, thank you for sharing in such a loving, timely and detailed manner, just how we knew Mark to share; what a beautiful remembrance. There will be many moments of goodbye and grief and I wish you and your family that happy memories, learnings in whichever way, and fond feelings will always be a part of that. <br><br>This blog is the only one that I continuously read through school, uni, and work times, admiring the systems, Marks astonishing insights, and the amazing community he built and fostered here! I am endlessly grateful to having been allowed to be a part of this community and Marks guidance through all these formative years.</div>

<div>Extremely saddened by this news. May God give strength to Marks family. <br><br>I am a long time reader of this website. Auto Focus got me hooked. More than anything I loved how Mark would come up with a new system and watch it making impact to his and others lives, with child like curiosity . It was always great watching him support anyone tweaking his systems or coming up with their own , like a father caring for his children's, never judging just supporting. <br><br>Rest in peace Dear Sir. May the seeds of productivity that you had bown, florish in the form of a vibrant community, helping humanity in the greater good .</div>

<div>I'm so sorry to hear this.  I've used some of the ideas behind Do It Tomorrow for a long long time and suddenly had the urge to look at the website to see if there was anything new.  Sadly, there was but it wasn't what I was expecting.<br><br>Thank you for letting us know, Matthew.  I am sorry for your loss but please be assured that your Dad did make a difference and his legacy will carry on.<br><br>Best wishes<br><br>Caroline</div>

<div>Like most of us here, I've spent years following Mark's ideas in his books and via this site. Unlike many in the time management or personal productivity worlds he was someone who didn't keep on spouting the same old ideas of others rebadged as his own. He thought clearly and explained carefully. He constantly tested and refined his ideas, always looking for improvements. His insights were often profound and his ideas, while always simple to implement, were often revelatory in their impact. And behind it all I knew there was a warm human being not someone presenting themselves as a superman.<br><br>God bless Mark and thank you. <br><br>Commiserations Matthew to you and Mark's family.</div>
