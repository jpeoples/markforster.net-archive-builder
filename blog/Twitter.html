<div>I discovered you and your blog via Twitter this morning -- and of course I'm now following you, as well as reading your blog in Feed Demon.<br><br>As a writer who blogs about productivity for writers, I am very intrigued by AutoFocusTM.  It seems ideal for a writer's mind, which so often operates in spurts.  I've already blogged about your public announcement of the system.  I suspect a bunch of writers will head over your way.  I certainly look forward to keeping tabs on your posts.</div>

<div>Hi Mark,<br><br>as a professional in Internet marketing consulting, I am quite active on the public speaking circuit, involved heavily in product development, active in my community, and run 2 businesses of growing concern outside the scope of my other activities. All this on top of the family I need quality time for (they are top of the list).<br><br>Managing incoming information, and sorting it into things I can or cannot act on, and the order to act on them, can be a daunting task, particularly during golf season, when my terrible swing seems to take even more of my time (really, it is that bad :)<br><br>I am going to spend some time with your material, and hope it will help me better manage time, motions, activities, and maybe find time for that swing as well!<br><br>Great blog, thank you.<br><br>Ron Davies</div>

<div>Thanks, Ron. I myself am finding AF ideal for this sort of mix.</div>
