<h1>Reviewing an Old Favourite</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2018-11-18 0:40</div>
<div class="content"><p>At the moment I’m trying to get a lot of work done before a holiday deadline. So I have turned to an old favourite of mine. I’m not sure it ever got a name - official or otherwise - but I wrote about it under the title of <a href="../blog/Another Simple and Effective Method.html">Another Simple and Effective Method</a>.</p>
<p>It is a really effective method for powering through a lot of hard work. If you’ve never tried it then maybe you should. </p>
<p>There is a problem with this method which is that it ends up with a lot of single tasks which <em>have</em> to be done on the next pass. I don’t like ever having no choice about what I do next so I have changed the rules to avoid singletons. The new rules are:</p>
<p>1. A single task is treated as part of the next group of tasks for the next selection.</p>
<p>2. If the single task is the one selected, then the next group of tasks is selected from again.</p>
<p>This sounds complicated but is easy in practice. It is just a matter of remembering that you must always give yourself a choice of tasks (at least two) to select from.</p></div>

<div>I use the method often at home. I mostly use it when I make a long list of things that must be done today. I like how it eases me into the work  but makes sure everything gets done.</div>

<div>Thanks for reminding me about this method, Mark. In the past, I tried this method and abandoned it for some reason (I do not recall why).   I tried it again all this week with the modifications you recommended - and it is an amazingly effective system.</div>

<div>Hi Mark, thank you for this 'new' old system. <br><br>I like it a lot because it condenses in itself both the long list and the short list concept. After a while, it is like handling some short lists at once, so that the daunting and resisting effect of an overlong list doesn't kick in.<br><br>Just a question: from the original post (<a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2013/5/20/another-simple-and-effective-method.html)" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2013/5/20/another-simple-and-effective-method.html)</a> I read: "choose a task from each section". <br><br>I have found this rule a bit problematic as this may interrupt rather than facilitating being in the flow. <br><br>I would rather prefer choosing each time which section to focus on, rather than being forced to do at least one task from each section. Indeed, with a long list one may have lots of sections, so one may be forced to follow a rather rigid scheme rather than relying on intuition when selecting the standing-out task.<br><br>What do you think?</div>

<div>Hi Mark,<br>I tried yesterday this new old system and it worked well.<br><br>I like the fact that it forces one to focus on closed lists which, eventually, get shorter and shorter.<br><br>However, I have seen  that having to do one task from each section somehow disrupts the flow. That is, once a task is done, I have found it more effective to choose freely the next task (even from the new halves just created) rather than being forced to move to another section to do it.<br><br>In other words, once a task is done, one would be free to choose the section which to pick up the task from (including the last two sections just created). <br><br>By the way, this would solve the issue of not dealing properly with urgent tasks (which are at the end of the list), without losing the FIFO effect.</div>
