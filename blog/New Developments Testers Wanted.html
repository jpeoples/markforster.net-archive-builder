<div>Hello Mark,<br><br>I've just started a new job so this is great timing for me.  I love the idea of having an autofocus mechanisim, and of something that can cope with a lot of tasks.  Looking forward to being a guinea pig!<br><br>Thanks<br><br>Ben</div>

<div>I'm SO glad to see this... I'm in desperate need of some sort of system that actually WORKS for me. I've tried them all, with limited success. Looking forward to hearing more about testing the system.</div>

<div>I just signed up and am very excited! I've found your recent modification to be very effective for me. Now I can't wait to see what it is that you think is even better!</div>

<div>Hi Mark<br>WHOOP WHOOP WHOOP  This sounds like grand fun.  This reminds me of the excitement I felt when I got my first science experiments kit as a young child!<br>gsdsmiles</div>

<div>p.s.<br>*blush*  I forgot to ask if we're supposed to TOTALLY ABANDON our current system we currently use or use this new method in tandem with what we are currently doing.  With my leaky brain, I don't dare to infer anything!  LOL!<br>gsdsmiles</div>

<div><<I forgot to ask if we're supposed to TOTALLY ABANDON our current system we currently use or use this new method in tandem with what we are currently doing.>><br><br>Basically it'll be up to you. I'm interested in how people actually react to the new system, which includes whether they combine it with something else, or even give up almost immediately. You'll get full instructions anyway on how to conduct the trial.</div>

<div>Thanks!  Looking forward to the unveiling is almost like having two xmas's to look forward to.  Whether we "take to it" or not is only half the value of the experience.  The other half is the fun of testing/learning something new.  I'd be gob-smacked if I actually found myself totally abandoning my current methodoly.....but, it is a possibility!  LOL! <br>Fun!  Fun!  Fun!<br>gsdsmiles</div>

<div>Mark,<br>This is great timing for me too.  I recently became "between jobs" and my life is totally disorganized.  I was getting ready to get serious with DIT again since it's the best system I know to get my act together.<br><br>I'm ready to dig in - if I can't break your system, nobody can!<br><br>I tweeted about this as MyklK - so you should be getting a flood of test subjects, but you can handle it ;)</div>

<div>Hi Mark,<br><br>I signed up for Beta testing your new system.  I can't wait to start on this.  Please let me know if you do not see me on the list of testers.<br><br>Best wishes,<br>-David</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Keyur - 2008-12-22 18:46</div>
<div>Signed up and looking forward to it. DIT works really well for me right now. I find the system similar to budgeting money, except it's budgeting tomorrow's time.<br><br>One thing I struggle with, and not sure the new system will cover, is the 'project management' side. Figuring out which projects to follow and when in my life to do them. Once I have an active project, I can go through the tasks fairly well. But I have issues with life goal planning. MS Project seems overkill for this and not sure which tools can be used for this. Excel seems ok, but it's not perfect since I have to run multiple systems.<br><br>Thanks for your hard work and sharing with the community!</div>

<div>Hi,<br>I signed up. Enjoy your holidays and I look forward to the system when it comes. It will be interesting, as the timing will be with the start of the new quarter. ("Interesting" is possibly an understatement.)<br><br>As a side note, never underestimate the power of a week of snow days to catch up on things... but I don't think that's a sustainable system long term!</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Frank - 2008-12-22 20:39</div>
<div>Let's all hope that in one week and six days, Mark doesn't announce that the system doesn't really work after all <grin></div>

<div>Hi Mark, It's great to be part of the party! Looking forward to taking part in your trials. This is cutting-edge online time management thinking and it's exciting to be involved...but could we ever give up on DIT, our saviour?</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Lena - 2008-12-22 22:41</div>
<div>I so can't wait either.  I was jealous of that other 'Lena' who posted a few days ago about her incredible progress  That wasn't me.  <br><br>And hey 'Les" -  Are you by any chance in Seattle??  You being a naturopathic student and having a week of snow makes me think that.  I live right by Bastyr.<br><br>With the week of snow (highly unusual here) and staying home, I've gotten a ton of backlog done, in between fort building sessions.</div>

<div>David:<br><br>Yes, you are on the list, but you should have had a confirmatory email. If you haven't, it might mean that emails from my news-sheet service aren't getting through to you. As that is what I will be using to send out the instructions and follow-ups, you will need to try and find out what the problem is.</div>
</div>

<div class="comment-meta">David Drake - 2008-12-22 23:54</div>
<div>Hi Mark,<br><br>I did receive the confirmatory email, so all is well!  I am ready to go with testing your new system -- and am excited about it!<br><br>-David</div>

<div>Mark, I just wrote a blog post encouraging people to sign up to be a beta tester. Counting down to January 5! (I do realize that date is approximate.) Here's the link to the blog post:<br><a href="http://www.peaceofmindorganizing.com/blog/wanna-test-a-brand-new-time-management-system" rel="nofollow">http://www.peaceofmindorganizing.com/blog/wanna-test-a-brand-new-time-management-system</a><br><br>Happy holidays.</div>

<div>Mark,<br><br>How excited am I? VERY! I've been trying to pin down what it is about DIT and GTD (boo hiss) that make me hop on an off the wagon more than a reforming alcoholic. I'm a Project Manager with a huge number of responsibilities/tasks and a graveyard of time management systems. I can't wait to take part! Happy Christmas Mark, and to my fellow productivity people! (If anyone wants to contact me directly, feel free to email me).<br><br>Simon</div>

<div>Hi Mark, I'd be eager to beta test the system.  I love how you're willing to test out these concepts, rather than just laying them down as gospel.  Please send me the details when you're ready.</div>
</div>

<div>Hi Mark,<br>  I just signed up for the beta testing.<br>  I don't want to dampen the enthusiasm here. However, I hope that the new system remains as simple as DIT or becomes even simpler. I was a GTD user and one of the main attractions of DIT was its simplicity.<br>  Anyway, I'm waiting, as others, for the 5th of January when I can see what this new system is all about.<br>  Happy New Year to everyone!</div>

<div>This sure sounds interesting.<br>I've been reading a lot of stuff on time management and improving productivity and experimenting with various applications over the last couple of years and I've actually started writing a book on the subject :-)<br>I personally find the site www.idoitontime.com pretty useful in scheduling reminders; even more so because of SMS alerts which you receive even when you are not at your desk. Its fantastic!<br>I look forward to testing your software and will revert with whatever feedback I have!</div>

<div>This is a great system for those of us who work in a solitary office at home! I am finding that I am still slightly scattered, but with time and discipline I think this is going to work well. I really like that I don't have to feel guilty about working on a few personal things during work hours - when it's the right time to do it, I do it. The list did grow quite a bit while I was out of town at a business meeting and unable to really do anything about crossing off tasks!</div>
