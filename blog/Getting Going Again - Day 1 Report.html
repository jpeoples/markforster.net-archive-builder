<h1>Getting Going Again - Day 1 Report</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2008-02-20 15:12</div>
<div class="content"><p>I left my last posting on <a href="/blog/2008/2/20/getting-going-again.html">Getting Going Again </a>at 8.40 a.m. with the question of how long would it take to finish my Will Do List today? </p><p>Well, the answer is that I finished it at 11.15 a.m. That included a good half-hour wasted because my computer was playing up.</p><p>Lots of things have sprung into my mind though to go into my Task Diary for tomorrow - including the all-important item “Think About Future of Business”. I’ve written before on how important it is to include project management items in one’s Task Diary. “Think About X” is one - it may be followed by “Investigate X”, “Discuss X with Y”, “Plan X” and so on.</p><p>Also I have added a couple of items to the Will Do list: “Read Blogs” (that is to say other people’s blogs) and “Reply to Comments” (on my own blog).</p><p>The most important thing to avoid here is to add too many things to either the Will Do list or to the Task List. I must keep my projects and activities well audited.</p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0340909129?tag=markforstthet-21&camp=1406&creative=6394&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=0340909129&adid=04WWDDGHJG5BEQBRWM66&" target="_blank"><span class="sizeLess20"><u><font style="color: #800080" color="#800080">Buy Do It Tomorrow</font></u></span></a></p>

<div>Dear Rob<br>There's no mystery about that. In fact over the last year I have been trying to simplify the methods in "Dreams" down to the absolute bare minimum. Although the methods in Dreams look very simple, they in fact require quite a lot of work, and I think the truth is that, if they've got to have a system, most people prefer a more "mechanical" one.<br><br>Unfortunately my efforts weren't successful.</div>

<div>As a postscript to my last comment (to Rob), I have put an entry in my Task Diary for tomorrow to write a posting about the tension between "structure" and "unstructure". So keep reading!</div>
