<p>I have been foolish enough to accept an invitation to give a short workshop to the London Coaching Group on <em><a href="http://www.londoncoachinggroup.co.uk/events/info.php?event_id=51" target="_blank">Coaching for Creativity</a></em> on the evening of March 27th. This is a subject that I have never given a seminar on before.</p><p>Anyway I thought “in for a penny in for a pound” so I made the blurb for the event as ambitious as possible by adding in every single angle on the subject I could think of, and then some. Nothing like setting oneself a challenge!</p><blockquote><p>During the session you will (subject to time available):</p><ul><li><div>Learn to do what you like and make it profitable</div></li><li><div>Learn to overcome resistance</div></li><li><div>Practice saying yes to life</div></li><li><div>Monitor how good you are feeling</div></li><li><div>Learn about practices which will enhance your creativity</div></li><li><div>See where your life has been leading you up to now</div></li><li><div>Identify what has been holding you back</div></li><li><div>Explore how decisions are made</div></li><li><div>Explore how to make inspiration strike</div></li><li><div>Learn how to live in the flow</div></li><li><div>Examine the brakes on our creativity</div></li></ul></blockquote><p>So I really am going to have to be creative to cover all this in less than two hours!</p><p>Maybe I’ll write some blog entries on these bullet points in order to get into practice.</p><p>Anyway if you can make it, I’d love to see you there. If you would like to attend, <a href="http://www.londoncoachinggroup.co.uk/events/register-event.php?event_id=51&PHPSESSID=ba36846bf7da8a0124d59d4f8b376ba4" target="_blank">contact the organisers</a> not me.</p><p> </p></div>
