<h1>Testing an HITM System 3: Bedding In</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2018-01-2 7:00</div>
<div class="content"><p>As I’ve said before, a list needs to become mature before it’s really effective but even on Day 2 there has been some movement.</p>
<p>Basically all the goals I reported on yesterday have remained the same with progress on all of them (except the funny cat videos). But there have been a few additions: </p>
<ul>
<li>The most important is fitness. I did my 10,000 steps today and intend to keep that going. But I’ve yet to incorporate strength training.</li>
<li>French and German have added themselves to Welsh. I know French well and German not so well, but they are both far advanced from where I’ve got to with Welsh. I’ve also got moving again on learning the <a href="https://www.iarmenia.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Easter-Armenian-Alphabet.png">Armenian alphabet</a> (39 letters compared with 26 for English). </li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, these are not goals I’ve committed myself to or New Year resolutions. They are arising directly from what I am actually doing. I expect them to change and develop.</p></div>
