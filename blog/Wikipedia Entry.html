<div>Hi Mark<br><br>Did you know you can edit your Wikipedia entry to correct the inaccuracies. (There's a little edit link at the bottom right corner of the entry) Best to register with the site or it displays your IP address for all and sundry to see - well, so it says - I haven't played around with Wikipedia myself just read its blurb...<br><br>Hope that helps anyway.</div>

<div>Yes, I do know. I've edited several Wikipedia articles. But somehow editing one's own doesn't seem quite right!<br><br>Actually the one that really needs editing is the one on Time Management. That's a complete mess.</div>

<div>You're correct that you shouldn't really edit your own entry: bad Wikipedia etiquette. But if you click on "discussion" on your article, you could leave a note on the talk page, suggesting some changes (and providing links to published sources, if possible, which seems silly, given that you're the ultimate authority on yourself — but such is Wikipedia...)</div>
