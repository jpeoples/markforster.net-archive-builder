<h1>Google Notes v. Diigo</h1>

<div class="content"><p>I wrote on November 22nd that <a href="/blog/2007/11/22/diigo-a-really-useful-program.html">Diigo was a really useful program</a>, which I was finding worked very well. Since then I’ve been using it a lot and have found it invaluable.</p><p>Its main disadvantage is that sometimes it slows right down and becomes difficult to access - it’s only an occasional problem though.</p><p>However a couple of people commented that they found Google Notes just as good and faster to use. So I’m going to have a go at Google Notes myself to see how they compare.</p><p>One can draw up huge comparison lists between different programs, but the real test for me is which one do I end up using?</p></div>
