<div class="content"><p>Part of my Future Reality vision is to do with being creative. So I thought some of you might like to see my photography portfolio at deviantART, which Iâ€™ve been working on since starting my current vision.</p>

<div>Mark - really enjoyed your photos of England. The people pictures probably would be more interesting if I knew who they were.</div>

<div>Mark - I especially loved the eggs....any chance I could download the close-ups for wallpaper on my e-reader? They make me happy just to look at them! Either way, nice job!<br><br>Thanks,<br>Krista</div>

<div>Your photos all make me feel happy. I like your eye for your subjects and composition. It's interesting to see the world through your photographic imagination. It takes courage to share yourself the way you do, through your writing, your use of your own self as example, and now your art. I honour and appreciate your sharing of yourself with us at all these levels. Thank you.</div>
