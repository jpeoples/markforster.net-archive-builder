<h1>Reduced Blogging for the Rest of August</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2016-08-4 21:07</div>
<div class="content"><p>It’s unlikely that I’ll be able to do much blogging for the rest of this month as we’re having to move out of our house into temporary accommodation so that the damage done by <a href="../blog/Monthly Newsletter Delayed.html">the flood</a> can be completely repaired. As everything will be thrown out of joint, I’m shedding commitments - and unfortunately this blog is one of them!</p>
<p>I’m hoping I may be able to continue to reply to comments and forum posts and perhaps even make the occasional blog post, but I can’t guarantee anything.</p></div>

<div>How are the repairs going, Mark?  I hope well.  <br><br>I am happy that it is almost the end of August and that you may be back blogging soon.  I do realize that these things sometimes take longer than expected, but I hope that is not the case.<br><br>I do miss reading your posts and the constant flow of new systems and variations of systems, and look forward to your return when it does happen.  I don't have the time to check many websites during the day, but I always have time for yours.</div>
