<h1>Reaction to the New Look</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2007-01-18 14:08</div>
<div class="content"><p>The reaction to the <a href="/blog/2007/1/12/new-look.html">new look </a>for my website has been unenthusiastic to say the least. Apart from a couple of encouraging comments the reaction is that it is difficult to read and the colour scheme is not suitable for the contents.</p><p>So why haven't I gone back to the previous colours?</p><p>Because both the traffic on the website and the advertising revenue have shot up since the change. And since I can't see any other reason why they should, it's just possible that the new colours have something to do with it.</p><p>It's also just possible that it's a pure coincidence, of course. But in order to be sure I'll delay the decision whether to change back for a while yet.</p></div>

<div>I can't say I have a particular view on the colour scheme and layout. <br><br>What I'm wondering is if the increase in traffic is due to the fact that you haven't updated it quite as regularly these last few days. I suspect there may be a number of people like me who like to get the latest daily instalment and if it isn't there, try again later - that would up the hits!<br><br>Perhaps you should update it once a day at a regular time for a while and see if the number of hits decreases, and then switch back to a randomly timed update and see what happens!<br><br>If the theory works out, it must say something about the effect of other people's randomness on our lives!</div>

<div>I like the new colour scheme, more soothing. Layout is a bit different but there is nothing wrong with change. <br>Cheers</div>

<div>I check periodically each day for something new, so several hits per day are from me.  However, if I follow the good advice in Do It Tomorrow (which arrived on Tuesday), I should limit my playtime on the internet more rigorously.  <br><br>I like the new color scheme.  I've shared your diet approach with my partner (he weighs twice what I do).  The free programs are a plus, too.<br><br>THANKS!!!  Please keep blogging.</div>

<div>I think the layout is an improvement.<br>I think the font is a little faint either make it larger, bold or shift to something sharper like Arial. I only got back on line recently so the "old" layout was new to me. It looked sharp but I did not like the way the screen would go black for a period before it settled whenever I logged on. <br><br><br>Maybe people are just adjusting to it and those who use it a lot are in mourning of the old style. Give it a couple of weeks and then make a judgment. The site has certainly improved since a year ago.<br></div>

<div>I happen to like the new look.  So at least one vote for it.  Looks really good at 1900x1200.</div>

<div>I agree with those who are not enthusiastic with the new layout. It's really difficult to read and the color reminds me of an old fainted tapestry.<br>I think it's a pity because I really enjoy the contents of this blog.</div>

<div>Probably a total coincidence, but I happened to drop your name (and a link to your website) on a popular time management forum at around the time you changed your look.   Not claiming for a moment that there's a connection,  but the couple of entries that followed mine hinted that it might have generated some interest. <br>FYI it was the "43Folders" Google Group.<br><br>Dave</div>

<div>Love the content (and your latest book), but frankly the new layout reminds me of the curtains and doilies in my (now deceased) great-aunt's parlor.  i.e., a bit stuffy and old-fashioned.</div>
