<h1>Urgency and Importance</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2012-01-28 9:13</div>
<div class="content"><p>In my last two posts I introduced the concept that urgency is superior to importance as a method of prioritizing. I then pointed out that although many tasks are obviously urgent or come with an external deadline, there are a whole raft of tasks which come without a built-in degree of urgency. We have to provide that ourselves.</p>
<p>So how do we decide what urgency to give a task?</p>
<p>By its importance to us of course.</p>
<p>But note that this importance isn’t a direct relationship. We have to give it the degree of urgency that is <em>appropriate</em> to the task. We can’t just say “Task X is more important than Task Y: therefore I’ll do Task X first”. That is where prioritizing by importance falls down. No doubt saving the world is more important than eating breakfast, but it still makes sense to eat breakfast before we set out on our work for saving the world.</p>
<p>You’ll see from the above example that urgency is very sensitive to time. Particularly when we are dealing with minor but necessary tasks there are times of day when they are urgent and times of day when they are not. Eating breakfast is not urgent in the evening, but can be very urgent in the morning.</p>
<p>Let’s have a look at the processes involved in prioritizing by importance and contrast them with prioritizing by urgency:</p>
<p><em>Prioritizing by importance</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Make commitment to a task or project</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Decide on its importance</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Do it as soon as more important tasks have been done</p>
<p><em>Prioritizing by urgency</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Make commitment to a task or project</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Decide on its importance</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Allocate urgency appropriate to the type of project/task in accordance with its importance</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Do it as soon as more urgent tasks have been done</p>

<div>Would a "Soon" list and a "Neglect" list do it? Moving items between the two daily perhaps.</div>

<div>I guess that hardest thing is to understand a difference between urgent and important.</div>
