<h1>How to Handle Re-entered Tasks in No-List Systems</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2016-06-7 17:51</div>
<div class="content"><p>Perhaps the thing I’ve found most difficult to get right in designing the best possible no list system is the question of how long to hang on to re-entered tasks.</p>
<p>My answers have at various times included the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have no re-entered tasks at all.</li>
<li>Re-enter a task only if there is current work still outstanding on it.</li>
<li>Re-enter a task if you expect it to be needed again the same day.</li>
<li>Re-enter all tasks regardless of whether they are going to be used again.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ve chopped and changed systems to fit one or other of these, but none have proved entirely satisfactory. At one extreme, a lot of tasks are started but don’t get worked on to completion. At the other, there’s a long tail of re-entered tasks to plough through.</p>
<p>And what does one do about open-ended tasks like reading books? Reading a stated number of chapters or reading for a set time are too rigid for my liking.</p>
<p>How to handle these re-entered tasks is a really important question because, you will recall, my intention is not to do anything but to do <em>everything</em>!</p>
<p>I had a flash of light recently about this. If, I asked myself, a task can only get onto the list by being done, then perhaps it should only be able to get off the list by not being done.</p>
<p>So I’ve added the following rules to the <a href="../blog/My Current No-list System.html">May 9 System</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Whenever a task on the list has been worked on it must be re-entered, whether or not it is going to be needed again.</li>
<li>There is no compulsion to work on any re-entered task.</li>
<li>When you come to a re-entered task and for any reason do not work on it, that task is deleted.</li>
</ol>
<p>These rules involve a little bit more re-writing than before, but they seem to have solved the problem. The question of how long to keep a task on the list now boils down to the simple principle: “Work on a task and it’s on the list; don’t work on a task and it’s off the list”.  </p>

<div>This sounds intriguing enough to try. I think I understand the rules, which are simple enough if you're using pen & paper.  I'll probably need to do it that way before figuring out a clever way to run the system electronically.  <br><br>I like the idea of auto-reentry and resulting forced dismissal (deletion without further action).  It may seem negative simply to delete a bunch of (possibly unfinished) tasks at the end of the day. But remember that each deletion is a task on which at least some work was done!<br><br>Does it make sense to use a special mark or highlight for the deleted tasks?</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Kiwi Erik - 2016-06-7 20:12</div>
<div>While this "enforced dismissal" approach would work for tasks that can be worked on at any stage throughout the day, but what about tasks that need to be done regularly, multiple times a day, but not every time you cycle through the list?<br><br>To use a concrete example, I have a series of wrist exercises given to me by my physiotherapist that I'm supposed to do every 2-3 hours.  I could set an alarm to remind myself to do them, but I found that too intrusive and didn't work well for me at all.  Instead, I simply put "wrist" on my list at the start of the day, do my first set of exercises, and then re-enter that item for later.  Each time I cycle through the list and get to that item, I think "is it time for my wrist exercises?"  If so, I do them.  If not, I skip that item but keep it on the list.<br><br>I often do the same thing with my "email" task -- I like to check my email regularly throughout the day, but don't want to be doing it every time I cycle through the list.  So I'll often get to "email" and decide it's only been half an hour since I last checked it, so I'll skip it.<br><br>I must admit that I like the freedom of being able to choose whether to do a task or not whenever I get to it on the list.  Sometimes I'll get to a task and decide I've done enough on that for today, so I'll just delete it.  The rest of the time, I'll either do it or skip it, depending on what the task is and whether or not I think I should do it now.<br><br>Because of this, I find that your option #3 works the best for me: "Re-enter a task if you expect it to be needed again the same day."  Enforced dismissal really wouldn't work for me at all, I'm afraid, because of the way I work the (no) list.<br><br> - Erik.</div>

<div>Erik,<br><br>Rules 2 & 3 above let you delete "email" or another reentered task, without skipping.  You would need to remember to add it again at the later time you want to do it. I don't think adding a previously-deleted task is against the rules.  Skipping over reentered tasks might result in a long list, which goes against the 'no-list' philosophy.</div>

<div>Kiwi Erik:<br><br>I wrote the new rules to solve a problem which I perceived with re-entered tasks. If re-entered tasks are not a problem for you then stick with what you are currently doing.<br><br><< I have a series of wrist exercises given to me by my physiotherapist that I'm supposed to do every 2-3 hours...

I want the only stuff on my list to be what is currently active. As ubi points out, tasks which I want to do again during the day can be re-entered when I'm ready to do them.<br><br>I find that so far the new rules give me the right balance, but as I said at the beginning if you don't have the problem, then you don't need the solution!</div>

<div>Kiwi Erik:<br><br>Mark's solution below is working well for me:<br><br>"You could just put "Wrist?" and "Email?" on your list. Then the task is to check whether it's time for the action."<br><br>I also use this first thing in the morning when adding day-specific reminders to my list from my calendar. My first task, "Calendar", is to add each non-time specific reminder to my list with a question mark. When I come to it in the course of working the system I do the reminder task by checking to see if it's ready to be done. Note that I'm checking to see if the task is ready, not if I'm ready. In other words, if I don't "feel" like doing it, but could, then the task is deleted without further thought.</div>

<div>I tried out this system but broke away after about two hours due to some interruptions.  Most of the tasks I did were one-off, and it seemed tedious to reenter them when I knew I would just be deleting them soon anyway.  It occurred to me that I could just enter any new task twice from the start, and 'dot' the first, rather than waiting until I had done some work on it.  So I suggest that we call this the DoubleEntry System.  ;-)<br><br>I might have a go with it again tomorrow.  Two hours starting mid-day isn't a fair test.</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Michael B. - 2016-06-7 23:09</div>
<div>To further illustrate how I handle day-specific reminders that I've noted in my calendar, this is my list from first thing this morning:<br><br><a href="http://www.dropbox.com/s/eslb5b48ko33kjz/Post_it_Note_1.jpeg?dl=0" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.dropbox.com/s/eslb5b48ko33kjz/Post_it_Note_1.jpeg?dl=0</a><br><br>1. First I wrote down "Calendar".<br>2. I wrote down all the day-specific reminders at once followed by a question mark.<br>3. I crossed out the task "Calendar".<br>4. I wrote down a new task, "Water", and drank half a liter of water.<br>5. As per Mark's May 9th system I then checked in on each of the reminders I wrote down earlier.</div>

<div class="comment-meta">ubi - 2016-06-7 23:22</div>
<div>Michael B.,<br><br>It sounds like you are using Calendar to populate a longer list.  Isn't that more like DIT than any 'no-list' approach?</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Michael B. - 2016-06-7 23:45</div>
<div>ubi:<br><br>No, not in this case. In the Do It Tomorrow system everything non-urgent and non time-specific that comes in today is written on the calendar for tomorrow. In my case, I'm only adding things to my calendar if they are best done on the date I'm specifying. Here are some previous comments from Mark and others to clarify:<br><br>Mark:<br>"Everything special I need to remember is in my calendar."<br><br>Bernard:<br>"Can you share how you keep track of activities that can realistically be done at a future date (i.e., buying a birthday gift, packing for a trip three weeks from now, etc.)? Some of the big things are probably easy to think of, on the correct date, but I am concerned that I will lose track of certain events if they are not maintained in a list somewhere."<br><br>Mark:<br>"It's perfectly OK to have reminders of things that need to be done at a specific time. You could put these into your calendar, or use a reminder system like Nudgemail."<br><br>Mark H:<br>"I have tried several of the no-list methods, but I feel the need to access other lists, calendar, etc. Could they be used as a feeder for the no-lists?"<br><br>Mark:<br>"Reminders of things which you have to do on or by a specific time are fine."</div>

<div>ubi: so we're at Double-entry bookkeeping are we?  That sparks a thought:<br><br>On the left side of our ledger are things that need doing.  On the right is time spent doing things.  Make sure these balance.<br><br>Not sure it's a good thought, but it's a thought!</div>

<div>Michael,<br><br>I think I'd be tempted to have a recurring "Calendar?" rather than transcribing the tasks for the day.</div>

<div>I am running into another issue which feels like the opposite of resistance. <br><br>When I start a task sometimes I get sucked into it and end up spending hours on it. This is bad when the task was mostly trivial and there was something more important that needed to be done as well. <br><br>If anyone else has run into this and has ideas around it would appreciate hearing about them.</div>

It could mean that you are resisting the more important task.<br><br>The best remedy is to set yourself a time limit of 10-40 minutes for each task. You can set an alarm to signal the end of the period. Stop as soon as the alarm goes off - even in mid-sentence.</div>

<div>Starting my work-at-home Wednesday a bit late, and dreading the idea of double-entering all the trivial one-off tasks I will do today, so no new experiment for now. I'll monitor the Blog to see how Mark's work evolves on this one.</div>

<div>Ubi:<br><br><<...and dreading the idea of double-entering all the trivial one-off tasks I will do today...>><br><br>I'm a bit confused by your problems with this.  Yes, if you take Mark's instructions literally you would re-enter every single task, but I think he meant that you only re-enter an *unfinished* task.  So wouldn't most (all?) of those "trivial one-off tasks" simply be written down once, done, and then crossed off?  You'd only re-enter the task if it wasn't finished...<br><br> - Erik.</div>

<div>Maybe I got it wrong somewhere, but I think I've found a simpler way to get exactly the same effect as the May 9th system with these new rules—but without all the crossing out and rewriting:<br><br>0. Start a new no-list every day.<br>1. Write a task on the no-list.<br>2. Work on the task as long as you want.<br>3. Write a new task on the no-list.<br>4. Work on the new task as long as you want.<br>5. Cycle back to the top of the list.<br>6. Go through each item on the list in order.  For each item, either work on the item, or cross it out.<br>7. When you reach the end of the list, repeat from (3).</div>

So I believe Mark's instructions are to be taken literally here. <br><br>Personally, I'm not rewriting unfinished tasks. I write the first task. I do the task. I write another task. I do the task. When done, I go down from the top of my list doing or deleting each task as in the May 9th system. Then I write a new task and continue.</div>

<div>I've been using it off and on as I thought maybe I was missing some element that Mark intended from the rewriting, but now that I know both you and I have had success with it, maybe it's solid!<br><br>I was first inspired by part of Jesse's post on not rewriting unfinished tasks: <a href="../general_forum/My No-List Hack.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2601072</a><br><br>I've used that with the May 9th system and it works great with Mark's new rules. The main issues are remembering where you are in the list and knowing how many times you've worked on a task. I'm not concerned with how many times I've worked on a task and knowing where you are in the list is as simple as knowing what you just did.</div>

<div><< knowing where you are in the list is as simple as knowing what you just did >><br><br>Yes.  Or just leaving your pen next to that item.  <br><br>Or using a bookdart or paper clip or something.  <br><br>Or, since things don't usually hang around my list very often (it's a no-list, after all!), I just use a dot or an arrow or a circle or something.  If I select the item multiple times, I just use whatever means of emphasis happens to come to mind.  If I used a dot last time, then maybe I'll use a star, or maybe I'll use an arrow.  Sometimes these pile up on top of each other, which makes the no-list a little messier, but I kinda like it that way.  :-)</div>

<div>Seraphim & Michael B:<br><br>You guys are brilliant!  So the system should be called "Delete or Do (After Two)" — the first two tasks are done as they are entered, then you keep cycling.  And you always add & do one task before cycling back, regardless of how many unfinished ones remain, right?<br><br>Are you sure it works out the same as Mark's DoubleEntry approach, when there are a lot of unfinished tasks?  I might try to verify that . . .<br><br>Update: If I understand Mark's DoubleEntry and your DorD rules, I think the order of task work comes out different.  <br><br>Suppose you have 6 tasks A-F and it takes 3 sessions to do A & E, only 1 to do B & F, 2 to do D, and 4 to do C.  For DoubleEntry, I get <br><br>a,b,a,c,a,d,c,e,d,c,f,e,c,(g),e. <br><br>For DorD, I get <br><br>a,b,a,c,a,c,d,c,d,e,c,e,f,e.<br><br>Please correct me if this is wrong.</div>

<div>Shamil:<br><br>Thanks, that's much clearer, but I'm still not sure about how you handle the task "Draft Project X Report".<br><br>First of all, you enter it on the list and do it, leaving it in the same place with a dot. So far so good. Then you work on "Email" and decide to work on Project X again. You cross it out and re-enter it with a dot. Again fine. But now comes the bit I don't understand. Without doing any other task you finish it off and delete it. Why did you need to re-enter it in order to finish it off?</div>

<div>Mark Forster:<br><br>I am taking action on something only by writing it down.<br>So in this case I need to re-enter recurring task (it's not enough to just cross out previous entry of this task).<br><br>It is like "Entry by Doing" method but with some additions:<br><br>If current task complete for today than I am crossing it out.<br><br>If current task is not complete or this is a recurring task I will cross it out later by re-entering it when I will be ready to take next action on it.

<div>Shamil's method has the virtue of an ordered log of what was done, but otherwise doesn't adhere to the DoubleEntry or DorD rules, I think.  According to the description above, there is no compulsion to do or delete a dotted task when cycling.  In the other methods, a recurring task cannot 'hang on' the (no)list all day.</div>

<div>I've been using the May 9th system as well. <br><br>Rewriting is a pain, but I like it. It gives me an intentional placeholder so I can make a clean break. That seems to produce a "stopping, for now" feeling that I like. Because of the new list every day principle, I also know I will be back to it soon but refreshed. With this clean break, I'm able to move to the next task with no significant mental residue. <br><br>I've spontaneously developed my own method for dealing with re-entered tasks. If a re-entered task can't be worked on right now, then I can move on to the next re-entered guilt-free. If there are no more re-entered tasks that can be done, then I can add a new task and action it immediately. <br><br>I figured this out sitting in a long meeting where my input and attention weren't critical for about 15 minutes. I checked off "attend meeting", and then looked at my e-entered tasks. There were two, "empty paper inbox" and "design loyalty diagram", neither of which I could do sitting in the meeting. Wanting to follow the system, but not wanting to waste 15 free minutes, I thought of something I could do in my current context - "sketch ideas for camping gear". I did it, crossed it out, and then wrote another which I didn't finish. <br><br>When the meeting ended, I headed back to my desk, went to write another task, and realized that I could action the re-entered ones now, so I did. It felt simple - action re-entered tasks only if they can be done, otherwise skip them. IMPORTANT: this should not be a way for me to procrastinate on something I'm resisting. It's only for things that can't be actioned at the moment due to circumstances. <br><br>I think it's similar to what Michael B. said: "Note that I'm checking to see if the task is ready, not if I'm ready."</div>

<div>I rather like the record of what I did, in sequence.<br><br>I have gone back to electronic, though. Since I do most of my work on the computer, it's no problem to have a OneNote page for the day's focus in my "Journal" folder, docked to the side of one of my screens all day. And a little AutoHotKey script to check off and re-enter unfinished tasks.</div>

I would like an approach that works with Mark's May 9, May 10, May 15, or June 1 systems and has the following attributes:<br><br>• Eliminates or dramatically limits rewriting. Ideally a task is written once until it's no longer relevant for the day<br>• Uses only a non-erasable ink pen and a piece of paper—no external tools for marking tasks<br>• Uses only a single dot for marking tasks and a crossing out when a task is deleted—no other symbols or markings</div>

<div>Mark's tick-table looks pretty good. If entered digitally as plain text, an end-of-day postprocessor could reconstruct the daily log.  And if you prepend the columns, it would all line up without the need for added spaces (if using a fixed-width typeface).  The columns would be flipped left-right, and the current column is on the far left.<br><br>I'll try to replicate here with vee (v) for checkmark, dash (–) for blank space, and two dots (..) for the horizontal line:<br><br>v v v v v Email<br>v v v v v Paper<br>v v v v .. Tidy<br>• v v .. .. Evernote<br>- v .. .. .. Mow Lawn<br>- .. .. .. .. Check Diary<br><br>This lines up pretty well with the Georgia typeface; not sure about whatever default your browser is using.<br><br>This would also work fine with a square-gridded notebook, pad, or even index cards.  Just reserve the maximum number of repeat columns (10-15?) on the left or right edge.</div>

<div>I've been using the same method as Seraphim and Michael B (what ubi called DorD), but with one difference: when you cycle back through the list, and do or delete each task in turn, you stop before the last task, and then write a new task. In looking through ubi’s example, I think that not stopping before the last task in the cycle may be what causes the divergence between DorD and DoubleEntry. <br><br>I myself am not having a problem (yet) keeping track of my place on the list (for the initial reason Michael B gave), but I’ll be interested to see what he is testing to keep better track.</div>

<div>This approach to using Mark's May 9 System should produce the following benefits:<br><br>• It's easier to remember what your current task is than mine and Seraphim's previous approach<br><br>• It uses only a single dot to mark tasks as done<br><br>• Reduces the amount of rewrites while also allowing all tasks to remain on the list until undone per Mark's new May 9 System rules<br><br>Example:<br><br>You decide to write the report as your first task, so you write:<br><br>Write Report<br><br>You work on the report as long as you want, then stop and dot the task. Now you write Email:<br><br>• Write Report<br>Email<br><br>You work on email as long as you want, then stop and dot the task:<br><br>• Write Report<br>• Email<br><br>Now here is a very important rule–before you can enter a new task, you must take action on every active task above the last dotted task. You move up the list, in order, doing or deleting tasks. If you do a task, cross it out and rewrite it at the end of the list. If you don't do a task, cross it out and move up to the next task. <br><br>Remember: A task gets on the list—and stays on the list—by doing it. And a task gets off the list by not doing it.<br><br>In this case there is only one task above the last dotted task: Write Report. So you work on Write Report as long as you want, then stop, cross out the task, and rewrite it at the end of the list:<br><br>–Write Report–<br>• Email<br>Write Report<br><br>Since there are no active tasks above the last dotted task, you can now enter a new task. You write Calendar:<br><br>–Write Report–<br>• Email<br>Write Report<br>Calendar<br><br>You check your calendar, then stop and dot the task:<br><br>–Write Report–<br>• Email<br>Write Report<br>• Calendar<br><br>In accordance with the rules, you now do or delete all the active tasks above the last dotted task. In this case you do Write Report, then cross it out and rewrite it at the end of the list:<br><br>–Write Report–<br>• Email<br>–Write Report–<br>• Calendar<br>Write Report<br><br>You then move up the list above the last dotted task and do Email:<br><br>–Write Report–<br>–Email–<br>–Write Report–<br>• Calendar<br>Write Report<br>Email<br><br>Since there are no more active tasks above the last dotted task, you can now enter a new task.

<div>An alternative approach involves two changes to the above:<br><br>1. Instead of doing the tasks above the last dotted task bottom to top, do them top down until you reach the last dotted task. <br><br>2. When you reach the last dotted task, do it and rewrite it at the bottom of the list, or delete it. The list is now free of dotted tasks so you can add a new task. <br><br>In short:<br><br>Dotted task on the list? Complete a pass down the list from the top.<br><br>No more dotted tasks on the list? You can now add a new task and do it immediately, dotting it when you stop.</div>

<div>Michael B.:<br><br>Thank you for this, and for such a worked through example.<br><br>While I was able to keep track of my place on the list with the earlier approach, it felt strange not to mark a task after working on it. So I prefer this new approach. (I also wonder if not marking a task after working on it is why it's possible to lose one's place.)<br><br>I also prefer working up the list rather than down the list, so I liked seeing that in the example. <br><br>Finally, I think I now know better what Mark meant, in his earlier comment, by the contradiction in the conditions you wanted. I take it that you weren't able to find an approach, consistent with your other conditions, that eliminated rewriting.</div>

<div>I'm nearly finished testing and experimenting with all the current "No List" systems. One variation that's proven nice is to make a couple simple changes to the system Seraphim and I mentioned earlier in this thread, which is essentially a modified May 10th system with the June 7th rule additions:<br><br>Entry Phase<br>1. Write a new task down. Use no markings or dots. Your current task during Entry Phase is always the last task on the list.<br>2. Work on the task as long as you want. When done for now, leave the task in place.<br>3. Repeat from 1 until ready for a follow up.<br><br>Follow Up Phase<br>4. When ready for a follow up, draw a line at the end of the list.<br>5. Cycle back to the top of the list.<br>6. Go through each item from the beginning and either dot the task and work on it, or cross it out.<br>7. If you dot a task and work on it, cross it out and rewrite it at the end of the list.<br>8. When you reach the line at the end of the list return to the Entry Phase.</div>

<div>The variation posted above should solve the problem of knowing where you are in the list at all times, while also limiting rewrites in a way that feels smooth and simple to use.</div>

<div>One potential question is "How do I know when it's best to enter the follow up phase?"<br><br>Answers might include:<br><br>1. When you feel like it.<br>2. When the paper you're using for the list is full.<br>3. Every hour, or half hour.<br>4. When you hesitate as to what needs doing next.<br>5. When you glance at your list and see a previously written task that needs doing again.<br><br>For me, the best answers are 2, 4, and 5. And the best answer is 4.</div>
