<h1>Simple Scanning - The Rules</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2017-12-2 8:25</div>
<div class="content"><p>As I said in an <a href="../blog/Thoughts on the Long List - Preliminary - What system to use.html">earlier blog post</a>, I was using Simple Scanning as far back as twenty years ago. But at the time I did not realise its potential. I may say more about that in future posts.</p>
<p>Up to now I’ve never written any formal rules for Simple Scanning preferring to describe it as “going round and round the list, doing tasks which stand out”.</p>
<p>There are several concepts there which need explanation, particularly if you haven’t used any of my systems before.</p>
<p>Simple Scanning is what I call a “long list” system. In long list systems the aim is to write everything down that you have to do, want to do or think you might do in one long list in no particular order. There should be no attempt to categorise, prioritise, or emphasise particular tasks in any way. There are no rules about what size individual tasks have to be or how they should be worded. </p>
<p>Since this is an intuitive system it is recommended (but not essential) that you use paper and pen rather than electronic means. A lined notebook is ideal.</p>
<p>If you use electronic means, be wary of time management apps which try to make you categorise and/or prioritise. These will work against the effective use of the system.</p>
<p>The second concept which needs explanation is what I call “standing out”. This basically consists of scanning through the list, doing tasks which you feel you want to do now. Don’t ask yourself “Do I want to do this task now?”. Just let the tasks stand out of their own accord.</p>
<p>For some people this comes easily and naturally, for others it takes longer to grasp.</p>
<p>Don’t get too worried about it. There’s no right number of tasks to select per pass. Assume you are doing it right unless you either find yourself selecting every single task or alternatively none at all. Allow it to find its own level naturally.</p>
<p>Another concept is that you should work on a task only for as long as you feel you want to. It is better to work “little and often” on tasks, than to work in huge bursts of activity - specially if the thought of a huge burst of activity puts you off from ever starting.</p>
<p>So however long your list is, you should be doing only tasks which you feel you want to do now and only for as long as you want to do them. </p>
<p>Now for the actual rules for simple scanning:</p>
<p> </p>
<ol>
<li>Write a list of things you have to do, would like to do or think you might do. One task per line.</li>
<li>If you are not sure about a task write it with a query (?) after it. </li>
<li>There is no need to make the list comprehensive because you can keep adding to it as you go along.</li>
<li>Don’t make any additional markings to indicate category or priority. </li>
<li>There are no rules about how you write the task - just as long as you can understand what you meant when you come back to it.</li>
<li>Tasks can be as large or as small as you like.</li>
<li>When you have finished writing your initial list, read it through quickly once to remind yourself of what is on it and where.</li>
<li>Scan down the list until a task stands out as being ready to do.</li>
<li>Work on it for as long as you like. </li>
<li>When you have finished working on it for the time being, re-enter it at the end of the list if there is still work to be done on it or if it’s a recurring task. </li>
<li>Cross out the task you have been working on.</li>
<li>Continue scanning down the list and repeat Rules 8. to 12. until it is time to stop working. </li>
<li>When you reach the end of the list, circle round to the beginning of the list.</li>
<li>At the beginning of the next work period, start again from where you got to.</li>
</ol>
<p>A couple of suggestions: </p>
<ul>
<li>Draw a line across the page at the beginning of each day. This helps to remind you whether you’ve done a daily task that day, and enables you to see how long any task has been on the list.</li>
<li>When re-entering a task, do it in the following order: 1) Re-write the task at the end of the list 2) Cross out the old one. This will prevent you from failing to remember to re-enter a task, and also from losing your place.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>

<div>Thank you so much for these rules. I have actually moved to simple scanning a few weeks ago from straight "random," and I love it. I found the random method very effective at the beginning, but gradually I would resist the whole list because things I needed to get done were not being done. I always had a secret hope that if I just kept working randomly I would eventually cover everything, but it didn't happen. With simple scanning, that "whole list resistance" is gone because I know I can always find something on the list to do. <br>Quick question, though: How often do you read the whole list? Is that something you might do at the start of the day?</div>

<div>Paul MacNeil:<br><br>In fact I don't re-read it very often because working the list imprints it pretty firmly in one's mind. I usually do it only when I've been away a couple of days or more.<br><br>Essentially the principle is to read it through whenever you feel you need to. That of course will vary from person to person.</div>

<div>I meant this description of Simple Scanning - it just seems beautifully elegant, like a beautiful mathematical truth, such as Euler’s identity. So simple yet so deeply expressive of so many psychological and behavioral principles that underlie your systems. It just feels true somehow.<br><br>Yet somehow I still can’t fathom how deleting tasks works. The rules themselves don’t seem to account for deleting tasks. If I am scanning for something that stands out, at what point would I divert from that mental mode into a mode that is considering whether I no longer have a need or desire to do a task; or whether the task is impractical; or whether I have already started working on a better alternative?<br><br>Maybe you could describe a bit more how you practically do this yourself in the course of working the system? Is it simply that some tasks jump out: “delete me, you don’t need me anymore”? That’s kind of how it has worked for me when using your other standing-out-based systems. Just wondering if it’s the same here.</div>

<div>Hey! This seems really interesting... It is pretty much what I have been doing whenever I do simple scanning. I do have one question. Does the query (?) affect the scanning process? I have never added a query or any other mark for tasks I felt unsure about. What is the point of it?</div>

For a start it slows down the speed at which you move through the list. Secondly it encourages you to second-guess what your intuition has already said to you.</div>

<div>All these long lists and short lists, and scanning 'methods' and putting dots next to things, or not doing that, and drawing lines, or not doing that, and doing it the night before or on the day...<br><br>Richard Branson is a man who quite clearly gets things done, and famously uses a notebook,<br><br>He writes things down to remind himself to do them, then he does them.<br><br>The problem of inaction, in my humble opinion, has nothing to do with the way one conducts oneself when making lists. It has, on the other hand, a great deal to do with overthinking.</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Paul MacNeil - 2017-12-10 13:40</div>
<div>Martin: Agree 100% about overthinking, to me its just another way of procrastinating. My core question is this: what's the best use of my time right now? <br>Having said that... I do like getting everything out of my head and onto a list without any kind of filter or "overthinking". From Richard Branson: "He writes things down to remind himself to do them, then he does them." Sounds like a great description of simple scanning.</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Alan Baljeu - 2017-12-10 17:31</div>
<div>I think there's a difference in that I'm guessing Branson does not write everything down, just the things he finds most important to remember.  It's also possible Branson has certain talents or habits besides this notebook that enable him to be more effective than the average person would be just writing a few things down.</div>

<div>Martin Williams:<br><br><< He writes things down to remind himself to do them, then he does them.>><br><br>Nevertheless he must have some way of scanning through them and choosing which to do now and which to do later, and he will probably mark the one he is about to do and draw a line through it when he's done it.<br><br>That's just about everything you mentioned as being "overthinking".</div>

Exercise seems to be at least as important for the brain as it is for the rest of the body, and it generally raises one’s energy level. A moderate amount of daily exercise, say 45 minutes, including aerobic exercise and/or strength training, is one the best uses of almost anyone’s time.</div>

<div>One thought strikes me.<br><br>Why cross out and re-enter each task everytime it is addressed?<br><br>Doesn't this lead to a longer list than necessary - especially for routine items<br><br>How about either dotting or dating at the end of the line for each attempt?</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">MrBacklog - 2017-12-11 11:00</div>
<div>Mike:<br>Yes, I have also been dotting my recurring tasks rather than re-writing them (inspired by Alan Baljeu's post on doting a list). I have modified it slightly to just a dot when a recurring task has been worked on for as long as I want to, but not necessarily completed. <br>It gives a good visual clue about what has not been actioned for a while and that the recurring tasks are generally balanced. I like it. <br><br>Mark: <br>another question on simple scanning - a lot of my tasks don't particularly stand out and I suppose they must all have equal importance, urgency etc. Logically, there is no reason to do one before the other. And quite rightly so - they all need to be done at some point and there is nothing really to differentiate them. What would you suggest in that case?<br><br>I was thinking of doing say 5 of the most recent and then 5 of the oldest. That keeps a nice balance between any backlog and the new things coming in. That seems to be a way of working that stands out for me!<br><br>Is it worth adding that scenario to the simple scanning instructions? (or your solution when that happens).</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Mark Forster - 2017-12-11 16:26</div>
<div>Mike:<br><br><< Why cross out and re-enter each task every time it is addressed? >><br><br>There are several reasons why I prefer to re-enter. The most important is that it allows "clumping", which is when tasks which get done together get grouped together. You may be able to see how often tasks have been done with dotting, but you don't get a feel for what order they have been done in. <br><br>Another important thing re-entering enables happens when you are working on several large tasks. Each time they get re-entered fewer and fewer other tasks surround them at the end of the list. So you can get two or three task being worked on over and over again without distraction from the other tasks on the list.<br><br><< Doesn't this lead to a longer list than necessary - especially for routine items >><br><br>It depends what you mean by a longer list. If you have 50 tasks on your list and you do one task which is recurring you still have 50 tasks on your list whether you dot it or re-enter it.<br><br><< How about either dotting or dating at the end of the line for each attempt? >><br><br>Don't let me stop you, but I'd be very reluctant to do that myself.</div>

<div>Hi Mark, I'm pleased to report I'm certainly not grinding to a halt - quite the opposite, it is do, do, do...<br>I think what is happening is that I have got no resistance what so ever to any task at all. All of them seem easy at the moment. <br>So my time management system just points me at say email for a while and I just do them one after another. Then it points me at post, and I just do one bit one after the other without a second thought. Then projects - I work on one for a while. And so the process carries on.<br>One email does not standout anymore than the next one. Likewise with post.<br>I have to say it is extremely comforting being in this state of mind.<br>However, I don't get any feeling of anything in particular standing out. How odd. Maybe I have just turned into a robot or a Vulcan!</div>

However there are plenty of other factors which standing out should be taking account of, such as time of day, energy levels, urgency and so on.</div>

<div>I love the idea of one list to rule them all, notwithstanding the disquiet I sometimes express on this forum.<br><br>My big criticism is as follows, and though Mark has countered it intelligently more than once, I don’t agree with him. <br><br>First, Mark has never, as I understand it, denied the indispensability of a calendar separate to the action list. It therefore seems to me that if a plurality of ‘lists’ is already admitted, why not allow in an obvious third one?<br><br>That list would, to all intents and purposes, be equivalent to Allen’s ‘Someday/Maybe’ category, or even Lakein’s Lifetime Goals List, which was different from his active projects list, and which he reviewed monthly in case his ambitions had changed.<br><br>Such a list could be reviewed once a month, for example. And moreover pruned or destroyed at a whim. Think of it as a bloke’s kitchen drawer. <br><br>And that would leave you with your current-projects list – the long list, plus your calendar. With your ‘other’ list in the once-a-month sort-of tickler folder, so to speak.<br><br>What’s wrong with that? Isn’t the insistence on one list cutting off your nose to spite your face?</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Alan Baljeu - 2017-12-12 3:36</div>
<div>Martin:  Mark has never said you may only have 1 list.  Rather, I believe his directive is that only one list should be telling you what to do -- in order to keep the doing as simple and fluid as possible.  I don't think he himself bothers with this someday list you describe, but if you did have one, you could look at it occasionally and if you decide something is worth doing, move that item into your one working list.<br><br>Mark Forster: I have one question for you, that I hope will be answered via blog post some day.  What specifically went wrong 20 years ago when Simple Scanning didn't work for you?  What happened?  And secondarily why won't this happen this time?</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">skeg - 2017-12-12 8:56</div>
<div>Mark this may seem off topic but it is related. I think with Simple Scanning (20 years ago) to AF to FVP to Randomizer to Simple Scanning (now) via your numerous books and all the other acronyms reminds me of your very first book where you gave very helpful hints and techniques, and then when momentum had been built up you had the confidence to move Beyond Techniques.<br><br>Here the long list can be picked off by any of the techniques you have developed and shared over the years and I know I will often have a bout of Randomiser to get moving when I have been away for a couple of days. Then when the techniques have been developed the confidence is there to not needing to use them.<br><br>Even short lists are for most of us a technique to take some items from a longer list to create forward motion. I know that's not how you meant it to work but I suspect few of us allowed ourselves to start from scratch every time when developing a 3 or 5 item list. I know I didn't as I was always worried something would fall off the edge and the long list of everything gives comfort that won't happen.<br><br>Even the discussion on resistance not existing is effectively a form of energy management  to keep the list moving.<br><br>So your ebook is going to be very short if all you are listing is the instructions above! However if you start at Simple Scanning and go through the techniques and tips to help people so that you are fully confident so you don't need the techniques and are back at Simple Scanning I think it will help many of the people following your website.</div>

And it should be a good purpose.<br><br>Unfortunately the "Someday/Maybe" list is really a way of disguising the fact that one is over-committed, or else it's just a trash can for ideas that are going nowhere. It's better to sort your commitments out and empty the trash can.<br><br>As for the "Lifetime Goal List"... If you need reminding what your life-time goals are, then they are not lifetime goals. Life-time goals should be impacting your life now, or else they are just pipe-dreams.</div>

<div>Hi Mark, could you share your thoughts on the pros/cons of the electronic list vs the paper list?  <br>I am fond of an electronic list (Word), partly as I can easily clump items together that I want to focus on during the day, partly as I can move completed items up to a separate section so I get a list of completed tasks (which gets moved to a productivity diary at the end of the working day) which helps me to keep track of progress / achievements. <br>Just wondered if you had any advice guidance on best use of the electronic list to support this approach.  Thanks!</div>

It took me a long time to learn that lesson>><br><br>That is interesting! What level of importance are you putting on "getting everything done".<br>The reason I ask is that simple scanning does not have a backstop so it could lead to things on the list being on there for a long time or possibly never getting done if they don't stand out enough. Especially for someone a bit overloaded.<br>I know it is the title of the website, so I guess it could be right at the top of importance.<br>If simple scanning had something in it to point at doing the oldest tasks at various intervals that might be a solution. Or is it not really an issue in that the oldest tasks should stand out at some point otherwise they should not really be on the list at all?</div>

<div>If something has been on the list for a long time, it's next action should be changed to "Answer why I'm not deleting it?" It's probably because of guilt or over-optimism. Neither one is a good reason to keep it on the active list.<br><br>A system that threatens to delete something if you don't take action might backfire. It's easy to panic and do something rather than calmly say "Maybe I shouldn't be doing this at all."<br><br>With paper, it's easy to see if something has been on the list a long time. It's on the oldest page. When I consolidate my list, I copy the date along with the task. Most electronic systems I've used have some way of adding date, such as tag or label or "sort by order created".<br><br>Good description of how rewriting causes clumping. Described like that, yes, I see it happening, and have taken advantage of it.<br><br>Also, rewriting makes clumping of things you aren't doing more visible. It's easier to see things that haven't been crossed out than things that have fewer dots.<br><br>I like the Hibernation / Someday / Maybe list. It's as effective as deleting a project, but emotionally easier. Now when I look at it, I have a good laugh at the projects I used to try so hard to keep active. Letting them go was the right thing to do. A few got reactivated, but it was when another project reminded me of them, not during the quasi-annual review of the hibernation list.<br><br>However, Mark's right. If it's truly a life-time goal, you need to be working on it so it happens. You won't forget the goal, but it is very easy to let days, weeks, years go by with no action.<br><br>It's also important not to have too many lifetime goals. You won't have time to do them all, and indecision can prevent action on any of them. I prefer to group them. Is there something you can do now that will help several goals? If so, you can take action now without having to choose the specific goal (and might learn things that change your goal). Are some of the goals similar? Do you want to travel to Italy and France and Germany and...or spend a month on an incredible European vacation, seeing what you can without spending all your time racing between places? Are some of them mutually exclusive?</div>

<div><< Someday / Maybe >> <br><br>Trying to maintain a special list like this feels like paying off a stiff mortgage. Debt weighing on my mind and hanging around my neck. Forget it.<br><br>But the Hibernating Easter Egg approach works pretty well for me. If I have a list with some stuff like that on it, and I don't want to throw it away but also don't want to do anything with it right now, I just put it in my chronological file. It's an accordion file with monthly sections. I put the papers in the slot for today's month, for all the papers I don't want to throw away but know what else to do with. I just put them in today's month. <br><br>If I do need a paper from there, it's easy to find, just go back a month or two or whatever.<br><br>At the beginning of a new month, I empty the monthly slot for the new month. It has all the papers I filed there since last year. Most of them I can just shred. There might be a few that I need to keep for permanent records or something.<br><br>And here is where I find those old someday/maybes. They feel like old friends, old nostalgia. That's why I called them Hibernating Easter Eggs, they feel like a surprise hidden present. Sometimes it's very funny to see what I was thinking about a year ago. Sometimes the things are useful - an idea that has been percolating for a while is now ready for action. Sometimes it's a little jarring to see that some issue I am struggling with today, I was struggling with it a year ago too! <br><br>But usually I just throw them away. <br><br>If I don't want it to percolate for a whole year, I can file it three months forward or whatever.<br><br>This method lets the ideas percolate, but I can consciously forget about them and they don't feel like debt.</div>

<div>Seraphim,<br><br>If a line says "Delete me!" then yes, delete it, immediately. Like you, I find it often triggers a snowball effect.<br><br>"Why am I not deleting it?" is only needed when something is hard to delete.<br><br>Hibernating Easter Egg. Great name for it! Does seeing the old idea beside the new month's papers makes you think differently about it? I do something similar with my reading list.<br><br>When I started my Hibernation list, I put it aside for 6 months. That was the longest I was comfortable letting things sit, and, fortunately, it was also long enough for me to see the light for many of the projects. Now I set it aside for about a year each time.</div>

<div>One trick from the old AF days I still use: on a page where all tasks are marked as done or deleted, I put an X in the top corner of the page. I skip these pages when scanning.<br><br>A circled X in the corner means that all pages previous are X'd out and I don't need to scan back any further. <br><br>It's a simple little technique but I use it all the time.</div>

<div>hi Mark,<br><br>I love the idea of this long list and focus on intuition.  I do have a couple questions:<br><br>1.  I work in different contexts that limit the tasks I can do:  airport, airplane, home office, etc.  I do GTD which makes it easy to focus on tasks with certain recources (phone, internet, etc).  How do you think the simple scanning can work well here?<br>2.  I like to track tasks by project.  Any tips for ensuring I can audit projects?<br>3.  Do you think having parent and child tasks on the same long list could make you numb to the child tasks or waste your time having to scan through them knowing you've not done the parent task?  In GTD you only put next actions, but that also frustrates me because it requires me to know what I've planned to know what's next.  Thoughts?<br><br>thanks,</div>

<div>Thanks Mark.  Great suggestions.  I like the idea of having the project name on the list and then detailed plan on my project sheets (which I keep for each project already).<br><br>For tasks that are due on a certain date, I assume you'd put them on calendar and then day you're set to do them, add to the list and then do them either throughout the day as you scan, or immediately if it's urgent?<br><br>thanks again,</div>

<div>Dear Mark,<br><br>I used Simple Scanning since you've posted this blog post. So I now have been using it for a few weeks. I appreciate your generosity and kindness in sharing your thoughts and techniques with us.<br><br>The positive:<br>* My days feels smoother. Things seem easier, and I am more in flow.<br>* The system is easy and simple to use, I don't get lost in working on the system more than doing the work.<br><br>The not so positive (which might be a reflection on my own incomplete perspective rather than reality, so I'd appreciate your input):<br><br>* People like Steven Pressfield in his War of Art argue that Resistance is our signal that we are working towards our greatness. And we should take it, feel the pain, the bitterness of working through resistance because that is what a professional does and that is how a professional achieves his greatness. That what is standing in the way of our Greatness is Resistance, so not pushing through it will keep us mediocre. What brought you to think differently than this common view?<br><br>* I seem to take less rests, which can end up in me switching from tasks in every few minutes. What I mean is I have rest activities in my list, yes. However, before I used to schedule much longer rests. Nowadays, because of my ability to get new "jolts of dopamine" by switching between tasks, when I start getting tired, I switch more and more between tasks which extends my tiredness until exhaustion. So yes, I do more, but rather than resting before I need to and therefore staying sharper longer, I go deeper into my reserves because I can just switch to a more interesting tasks. But how would this be different than switching to facebook or email every few minutes to get a "jolt of dopamine"? Nicholas Carr in his book The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains argues that not focusing on one thing for a long time and switching tasks frequently to get a dopamine hit makes us shallow and unable to keep focused for a long time. We're becoming ADD because of switching so much.<br><br>* I feel internally a bit "guilty". Most of what I have learned about productivity made the case for a "cost of switching activities". That each time you move from activity to activity, you lose focus and need at least 20 minutes to regain it. It doesn't seem to be the case, because in my testing, if I try to stay on an activity after I am resisting it, I just can't focus enough to give it the clean<br><br>* Before, I used to be able to buckle down and work for 50 minutes on one single activity. Now I am much more aware of resistance and switch . Peter Drucker argued in the Effective Executive that to become effective, you have to focus on one thing for extended periods of time. Now, it is working well, but it makes me worry that over the long term I am not training myself to get into some "deep focus" state that can get me into true flow where the best work can happen. Although now it seems like I am "riding the wave" of my attention, taking it where it wants to go and therefore finding really good concentration this way, I am worried this might train me to becoming unfocused and distracted over time.<br><br>* Why should I trust my intuition? Just asking you from your own experience, why did you come to this conclusion? Because, in my own mind, what separates us from animals and caused us to create the civilization and progress we enjoy today is thinking, not just following our whims and our intuition. What led you to think intuition leads to better or equal results compared to thinking?<br><br>Thanks again, Mark. And I hope you'd think about these and answer from your own experience, what brought you to our own POV and perspective in trusting that this system is superior and that trusting our intuition is the right thing to do and that not pushing through resistance is the way to get more of what we want out of life and do what has to be done to get there.</div>

<div>Wow Blue, that is a lot of very interesting thoughts and questions.  Might be worthy of bringing over to the Forums as its own topic.<br><br>I don't claim yet to be master of all this, but I can say after many years of doing Mark's systems I have not lost the ability to focus for longer periods.  <br><br>Back to speculating.  In fact, I think that switching around between tasks and running through the list regularly has the opposite effect: I get distracted less because I am confident the other things are being/will be taken care of in time.  It is still important to spend longer periods on stuff, but if you approach it right you can switch away from an intense task for a short while and come back to it without the huge effort to get back into focus.  In part it depends where you leave things off.  If you leave where the problem you need to tackle next is clear (even if the solution isn't clear), then it is easy to get into.</div>

<div>BlueValentine: Why should I trust my intuition? <br><br>One approach to this is via the phenomenon of "hypofrontality" - reduced activity of the pre-frontal cortex, allowing other parts of the brain to get a look-in. eg https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RaRQ9jPk4E<br><br>This may be linked to flow-states</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">BlueValentine - 2018-12-16 19:52</div>
<div>Michael, I don't know what hypofrontality has to do with Simple Scanning. Yes, maybe I do feel one with the scanning while doing it, so yes, more parts of my brain will be involved. But will that make the decision more correct? That video doesn't talk about this, it's just explaining hypofrontality.<br><br>In all cases, I tried to not do Simple Scanning and "force" chunks of productivity, but it feels very exhausting, I am using too much willpower, and then I become distracted. So I am neither fully focused on the project I assigned the chunk of productivity too, nor doing something else.<br><br>I don't know, man. This is not easy. Just because Simple Scanning is more pleasant to use doesn't make it more "right". But it seems to have a lot of right things about it.<br><br>So I was wondering about Mark's experience and answers to the questions I asked about.</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">BlueValentine - 2018-12-17 11:56</div>
<div>I thought about hypofrontality. When the task is equal to skill, it gets you into flow.<br><br>So maybe how this relates is: whatever task you feel ready to do, it means your skill, energy, attention, readiness is perfect for it, so it is much more likely to get you into flow / hypofrontality.<br><br>That would make sense.</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">michael - 2018-12-17 17:18</div>
<div>BlueValentine: Yes, I'd say that was a useful way of grasping it. Perhaps a further comment might be that an overly rational approach which numbed an emotional response was imbalanced. Perhaps "arational" as a mid-point between planned and intuitive characterises simple scanning.</div>

<div>Thanks Blue for bringing up fantastic set of introspections and relating other existing productivity idea into the process of simple scanning.<br>Few pointers:<br>- Intuition is part of thinking, it is not over or beyond the process of thinking. What we believe to be intuitive may be something beyond of conscious cognitive realm. Malcolm Gladwell's 'Blink' is entirely about this premise. Our body (before it reaches our brain or the conscious part of it) senses and in many ways 'predict' what is going to happen. And it is good to recognize this and appreciate it.<br>- The book, 'Thinking Fast and Slow' by Daniel Kahneman - specifically deals with this dichotomy. However, based on my minimal experience in language learning and acquisition, I would suggest categorizing intelligence into 3 parts - instinctive, intuitive and logical. In case of productivity, standing out for me would mean, my personal psychological readiness (borrowing it from Mark). I remember Mark beautifically stating that you cannot logically get your psychology ready, despite saying yourself you should be doing a task, how important it is, how long-term benefits you might reap out of it. There is sense in this process, but there is a limit to it. So better use the unknown element of 'intuition' to your aid to do it.<br>- In Vipassana meditation, there is this idea of using body senses to identify one's thought imprints. It argues that it is not that it doesn't exist, but we, at our current mental state of 'vibratons' simply can't detect it. We have to sharpen it or arrive at it to sense it.<br>- We should differentiative between memory, consciousness and wakefulness. We often mix these. Here is a beautiful talk on the same - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7irEcQHChw<br><br>Despite these explanations, I am just a novice in understanding how this works. I have been using simple scanning process - however as with always, I am 'forced' to the tasks that needs to be done, given the external obligation/ committments. <br>I would also like to understand this notion of 'deep work/ focus' and 'cost of task switching' that people like Cal Newport are making popular (which I am skeptical, given the completely non-average environment that Prof.Newport works in).<br>Would love to hear of course from the master himself - Mark :)<br><br>Side note:<br>And of course, all said this done, I think Mark's ideas are something that is not being recognized, for want of better word(s) 'academically' or 'scholarly' - like others do. I am simply not talking about SS, but also his process of thinking/ writing. May be his ability to put these ideas in a straightforward way, unduly dismisses the depth it comes up with. I hope people like Blue can give it necessary connections and depth.</div>

<div>Hi Mark, happy 2019! Hope you are well. <br>I am thinking of trying Simple Scanning as described above as my attempt to move to more of a HITM system in 2019. <br>A question: my current approach is to start the day by reflecting on key objectives for the day and write a short dynamic list of key items.  Could (or should) this process be incorporated into the Simple Scanning approach?  (Could perhaps have a recurring task: reflect on goals for the day.)  <br>I do find the daily review of aims helpful, but I also want to get away from older tasks/commitments falling by the wayside without proper consideration (hence my interest in a HITM long list approach). <br>I don't want to impede the aim of allowing intuition full freedom to decide on priorities and timing, so I'm inclining to just run with the system as described and see how it goes, but any comments would be welcome.</div>

<div>To answer my own question: Simple Scanning via a paper notebook is working better than expected, bringing a greater clarity of commitments, sense of purposefulness, and helping to scoop up items that could fall by the wayside.  <br>Reflecting on main goals at start of the day seems to influence what stands out during scanning, such that I get started on the "real work" early on.</div>

<div>I might have missed it, but how do you know where you got to when you start the next work period.  Do you leave one dotted?</div>

<div>Thanks, Alan Baljeu. That is reassuring<br><br>Right, back now to the 3 page list  I seem to have generated in the 30mins since I took up simple scanning.</div>

<div>As for step 13, do you mean to immediately jump to task 1 on the list when you've reached the end of the list, and scan from there?</div>

<div>Yep, return to step 8.</div>

<div>pickenham:<br><br><< I might have missed it, but how do you know where you got to when you start the next work period.

This is easy if you've followed the suggestion to draw a line at the beginning of each day. The reason for starting there is that you get to work on all the active stuff straight away without having to wade through old stuff first.</div>

<div>Do you think capturing new tasks starting at page bottom and executing tasks from the top down would give a slight edge? Reading a bit of Michael Linenberger gave me an appreciation for newer items being more relevant as a rule. Plus urgency is better handled as a bonus. What say?</div>

<div>Mark,<br><br>The latter is what I mean. I didn't realize that Simple Scanning with the "scanning" in the other direction (new->old instead of old->new) was AF2!<br><br>Now I've got to go back and read about both! <br><br>If it hasn't already been discussed ad nauseum, why do you prefer the scanning to be the same direction as the direction of capture? Both appear to handle clumping, attenuation, and maturity. The main difference I see is the attitude towards how much weight should be given to urgent or recent tasks relative to more mature tasks on the list. Am I missing something, what has your experience been?</div>

<div>Seth:<br><br>I'm still not totally clear what you mean. However:<br><br>Simple Scanning scans in the direction old>new. As far as I can gather you are proposing scanning from new>old on the grounds that "it gives more weight to urgent or recent tasks relative to more mature tasks on the list."<br><br>In fact it has the opposite effect. When you scan from old>new any work which is worked on but net completed is re-entered at the end of the list, plus any new tasks/projects. The result is that when you arrive near the end of the list you have a list of all tasks you are currently working on, plus all new tasks. You can carry on working on and re-entering these tasks until they are either complete or you have done as much work as you currently wish to do on them.<br><br>Contrast this with working new>old. You get the new tasks, but can only work on them once and then have to go right through the entire list before you get a second shot at them.</div>

<div>Mark,<br><br>Apologies if I wasn't clear, you are correct that I am proposing scanning from new>old.  In thinking through your reply I realized I've been doing Simple Scanning wrong for a long time, starting back at the beginning after each task is done.  As such I can see why focus on urgent/new tasks is actually <br><br>I guess without realizing it I was proposing that after every to-do is actioned and possibly re-entered, that you start again at the very end of the list and work towards the start.  This isn't Simple Scanning with reverse scanning, it's AF2!<br><br>Picking up at your last task is a key simple fact I've been missing, which changes the list functionally into an endless loop with no beginning or end to denote urgency or age as AF2 had.  I can see how this is preferable because of clumping, and except for tasks needing to be done immediately, same-day tasks will be handled well enough with SS.</div>

<div>I Mark and all <br>Back on this forum since a long time ;-) <br><br>I like the concept of " simple scanning" by a certain way it is very near the excellent autofocus 1 except that it was a close list (one Scan per page) and this is a running list separated per day. <br><br>The stand out system is incredible... It is great for doing the right things. <br><br>Anyway cleaning the list is indeed crucial, otherwise the increasement of the list becomes un manageable. <br><br>I am going to try it and see how it works for me ! <br><br>Thanks for sharing</div>

<div>"In fact I don't re-read it very often because working the list imprints it pretty firmly in one's mind. I usually do it only when I've been away a couple of days or more.<br><br>Essentially the principle is to read it through whenever you feel you need to. That of course will vary from person to person."<br><br>This finally makes sense. No wonder I was feeling bored to use SS.<br><br>Let me explain.<br><br>I kick-started my journey using Dreams method. No list, only weekly or sometimes daily future vision.<br><br>Started using SS, when the above became too directive & was loosing the fun of actual Future visioning, 1 year or 3 years or 25 years down the line.<br><br>Trusting my intuition using SS, came very naturally. Because I always get to do only that felt like doing, following my natural instinct.<br><br>But lately I felt dragged because once I do a task, I knew what I need to do but to be true to SS, went back to the list to 'find' what stands out. Sometimes it matched, sometimes it doesn't.<br><br>Then for the past week I started 'cheating'. I scanned haphazardly so I will arrive at the task I wanted to do :)<br><br>Felt bad sometimes that I didn't refer my SS list to decide what task that stands out and to be done. I simply went on doing the task, carried away by the flow..<br><br>(I almost wrote an entire book, this way;)<br><br>Now this finally makes sense. SS list is my guide to intuition, not a dictator... <br><br>The key point is whether in this moment I'm following my intuition or not..<br><br>#TrustYourIntuition</div>

<div>From "Simple Scanning - The Rules":<br><br><< A couple of suggestions: <br><br>[1.] Draw a line across the page at the beginning of each day. This helps to remind you whether you’ve done a daily task that day, and enables you to see how long any task has been on the list. >><br><br>I suppose this suggestion would also entail writing today's date below the line?<br><br>I'm curious if this suggestion is still recommended today. Is it strongly recommended? <br><br>I used Simple Scanning longer than any other long list system, but I admit that I never followed this suggestion. I suppose I was reluctant to add clutter to this perfectly "simple" system. Probably also reluctant to affect the intuitive selection process in any way. On the other hand, I could see this line drawing exercise as adding a closed-list type effect to the system, a bit like DIT or DWM. Anyway, I'm just curious about it. I don't remember this detail being discussed previously.</div>

<div>Belacqua:<br><br><< I suppose this suggestion would also entail writing today's date below the line? >><br><br>Not necessarily. It is entirely up to you. The main purpose of drawing the line is to record where you stopped the previous day. That will work whether you date the line or not.<br><br><< I'm curious if this suggestion is still recommended today.
