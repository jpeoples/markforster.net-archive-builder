<h1>So Can I Do Everything Yet?</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2016-07-21 17:29</div>
<div class="content"><p>Can I do <em>everything</em> yet? (That is everything I actually <em>want</em> to do)</p>
<p>Not quite but I’m getting there!</p>
<p>I enjoyed the Random Method, and it certainly produced a high volume of work from me. But in the end I found it is too much of a scatter-gun approach. I need something more targeted - though ideally producing no greater an amount of procrastination.</p>
<p>So, a method that’s closely focused but with minimum procrastination… where would I find that?</p>
<p>Well, I found one that fitted the bill among the many systems we’ve discussed recently. If you’re a regular reader, see if you can identify it.</p>
<p>A few clues:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s one of the no-list systems</li>
<li>It is <em>much</em> more targeted than the Random System</li>
<li>It is very time sensitive</li>
<li>It was the only way I succeeded in overcoming a particularly bad bout of resistance (to <em>everything</em>) this week.</li>
<li>So it actually produces less procrastination than the random method.</li>
<li>It provides a sense of direction.</li>
<li>It’s very flexible</li>
<li>You can quickly react to changes of circumstance or location</li>
</ul></div>

<div>Very time sensitive? Then it must be The Next Hour of Your Life (July 2) system.<br><br><a href="../blog/The Next Hour of Your Life.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2016/7/2/the-next-hour-of-your-life.html</a></div>

<div>I would guess NoList FVP. For me, I've been using No List Autofocus. It seems to be working well. What I like about it is the ability to build up a list of things that are most pressing and working through them repetitively to completion.</div>

<div>Bernie:<br><br>I agree too! SMEMA is my favorite no list system.  No list fvp causes me to procrastinate like crazy.  Maybe I'm just doing it wrong.</div>

<div>This is a little offbeat, but i thought I'd mention it because Mark has blogged about intermittent fasting, and this idea is inspired, obliquely, by no-list. My idea, that I intend to try out next week is this:<br><br>1. Start fasting at a point in the target day when it feels right, and write down the time.<br>2. Aim for a minimum of 16 hours' without any calories. (Though I permit myself tea and coffee.)<br>3. When the fast ends, the eating window may be as long as but no longer than, the fast.<br><br>My thought experiment (and common sense) demonstrates that the eating window is usefully compromised by sleep, but fasting, of course, is not.<br><br>I thought it might prove an interesting way of having a somewhat freestyle approach to starting and ending a fast (begin when you're ready, pack it in when you're losing your mind), with a simple algorithm: The longer you fast, the more you feast. Good old operant conditioning, albeit self-imposed.<br><br>The point is that the algorithm allows freedom to give up a fast when one is ravenous, but removes caprice from the equation. Once you start, of course, you begin an automatic binary process. (But I think one must have a minimum value for a 'fast' of about 16 hours.)</div>
