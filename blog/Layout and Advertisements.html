<h1>Layout and Advertisements</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2008-03-26 13:48</div>
<div class="content"><p>I’ve come to the conclusion that the amount of income generated by the ads on this site is hardly worth the effort of inserting them. So over the next few days I will be removing all advertisements on this site, apart from those for my own books, and returning the layout of the blog to multiple postings on the page.<br></p></div>

<div>Hi Mark<br><br>Thank you for reverting to the previous layout. I find it much easier and clearer to read. It's also nice to have more than one blog posting per page as it seems to give more continuity to the different postings. <br><br>However I, and I'm sure many others who regularly use this site, really appreciate your generous input and advice. Whatever it takes to keep the Website, forums, etc. going is fine by me! So I'm not against the ads per se but it certainly is easier to read the contents of the site without them.<br><br>Many thanks again for your generosity<br><br>Regards<br><br>Hannah</div>
