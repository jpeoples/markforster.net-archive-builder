<h1>"How To Make Your Dreams Come True"</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2011-06-2 16:55</div>
<div class="content"><p>I feel that I’ve taken SuperFocus about as far as I can for the time being, and so I have turned my attention back to my second book (of three) <em>How To Make Your Dreams Come True</em>. This book is now out of print, but you can download it for free by <a href="/storage/How%20To%20Make%20Your%20Dreams%20Come%20Word%2097.doc">clicking here</a>.</p>
<p>I’m seriously thinking of re-writing this book as an e-book. It’s very different both in content and style from my other two books, and I think the style tended to put many people off. What I think is needed is a clear manual which is much easier to follow.</p>
<p>In the meantime, many of the issues raised by<em> Dreams</em> are being explored by the Forum members. See the threads:</p>
<p><a href="../general_forum/Personal experience with Mark's How to Make Your Dreams....html">Personal Experience with Mark’s “How To Make…”</a></p>
<p><a href="../general_forum/What to expect initially from Dreams.html">What to Expect Initially From Dreams</a></p>
<p>I would welcome input, either in the Comments to this post or in the Forum, from anyone who has used or is using the Dreams principles.</p></div>

<div>What I like about the book as it is, is that it gives the reader models for thinking.  If you do re-write it, I'd suggest finding a balance between giving the reader a clear map of where you're headed while still providing lots of examples of your thinking.  For a lot of people, part of the issue is not just learning a new technique, but understanding what using that technique looks and feels like.  Learning to "talk to yourself" is a messy process, and really does take you places you didn't expect to go.  The book as it is shows that, and makes it ok.  My concern is that a step-by-step guide might lose that sense of playfulness, exploration, and acceptance of imperfection.  I always find it more useful to be shown what to do, rather than told what to do.</div>

<div>For me the frankness of the dialogues in "Dreams" was very appealing and authentic; I felt they added real humanity and is one of the things that kept me reading it. I fear a manual will be less human, but may make the methods more accessible to people. There seems to me to be quite a few manuals on similar approaches. Perhaps there is room for a revised approach.</div>

<div>One suggestion: replace "Future Vision" with "Ideal" - it eliminates push-mode drivenness to get to some point in the future and lifts the dream to a timeless vision, relaxing "push harder" thinking - or at least it does for me.</div>

<div>I used this site to make a .mobi for my Kindle.  It handles other formats too :)  <br><br><a href="http://www.2epub.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.2epub.com/</a></div>

<div>Oh, and Mark, let me know by personal email if you want the .mobi I made. I will send it to you and you could put that up alongside your .doc file.</div>

<div>Thanks, Mark. Though all you've got to do to read a Word file on Kindle is email the file to Amazon using the address in your Kindle Settings. They'll convert it and send it to your Kindle automatically.</div>

<div>Yeah. Unless you're too cheap to use their conversion service :)  Man, I just outed myself....</div>

<div>Kalieris & michael::<br><br>My aim in writing the manual will be to make the methods more accessible, and also to update them. It will contain examples. And of course the original book will still be available on-line for those who want it.</div>

<div>Suggestion: Divide in 2 parts.  One part explanatory text "here's how to do the dreams method" interwoven with your dialogues to illustrate..  <br><br>Also I find coaches tend to be circular in applying their own methods.  It's like salesmen who sell sales lessons and artists who paint about art, and writers who write about writing: They connect to their peers but not the general public.  A book that teaches dream pursuit by example of dreaming about mastering dream fulfillment techniques - I don't know if your book is like this, but it's my impression of the format.</div>

<div><At the moment I'm favouring the terms Future Reality and Present Reality, which I find add a bit of focus to the vision and give a more definite place of "residence" for the Future Self. ><br><br>Maybe it's just me, but I feel presumptuous to talk about Future Reality and Future Self, when I really don't know if it's anything like the actual future.  I prefer to think of a Potential Self.</div>

<div>Thank you everyone for your comments, but what I am actually asking for are people's experiences with putting the Dreams methods into practice - either now or in the past.</div>

<div>Hello, Mark! How do you plan to distribute this book? You say .doc version can be downloaded, but in the file there is notice about not copying, distributing, modifing etc. So do you plan to make the book free (like under Creative Commons license) or non-free (restricted usage, modifying, sharing)?</div>
</div>

<div>Thank you, Mark. I am looking forward to reading it.</div>

<div>sindikat:<br><br>I'm not sure of the exact format yet, but it won't be free of charge, and therefore copying will be restricted.</div>

<div>What helped me was the development of a relaxed trust in the unconscious. Doubt and analytical thinking seems to hinder me. trust and surrender - letting go - seems to free up the flow.</div>

<div>One part that (I think) could use clarifying is using PULL as a primary means for getting things done. For example, the consequence for NOT engaging in PUSH activity for a hobby/interest, may help increase PULL motivation, creating Flow-like states, and momentum towards things you really, really want to do. But how about the minutiae of a job, parent or general living. Often, I don't want to workout, but with some PUSH, I do feel better after I go. Yet, the internalized Mark Forster voice states: "Well, that's fine, but if you stuck with PULL, you'd be compelled to create a stronger vision for your physical body, not needed guilt,etc., to help you workout".<br><br>Anyway, a discussion of real world consequences of living in PULL mode would be greatly appreciated. I'm posting this on the forum as well.</div>

<div>avrum:<br><br>If you an internalized Mark Forster voice telling you to do anything, you've got it all wrong. You need the internalized voice of avrum's Future Self.</div>

<div>Watching your journey was interesting and educational. It was reassuring to feel your trust in the process. I read the entire book first, bookmarking the exercises. Now I'm doing the exercises.<br><br>"What was better about today?" and it's making a nice difference. I've just finished my first no-holds-barred Future Vision (exercise 3). Well, some-holds-barred since everything was subject to relaxed and not over-committed.<br><br>It's encouraged me to focus on kids that will remember great parents rather than fighting to teach them life lessons. It's already paying off. The kids are still learning the right lessons, and they are happier. I'm learning to relax.<br><br>By the middle of the book, I wondered if you intended me to get the same insights from the exercises that you did.  While your insights were interesting and helpful, I hope to have a different journey with new insights. Otherwise, I might as well take a short-cut and just use yours. I'm not how to address this other than reiterate that everyone's journey, and two journey's by the same person, will have differences and similarities. (That assumes I'm right about your intentions.)<br><br>I'm not recording What was Better every day, and the exercises are sometimes a week apart, but it's good progress.</div>

<div>Cricket:<br><br>You're right. The exercises and methods are designed to get at your insights and vision - not mine!</div>

<div>While fulfilling your dreams first you need to improvise yourself and for that you need proper time management. Time management is most important aspect of life.<br><a href="http://www.thoughtful-self-improvement.com/Time-Management-T2.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.thoughtful-self-improvement.com/Time-Management-T2.html</a></div>

<div>While watching "The Time Traveller's Wife" I came across <a href="http://iamasuccessstory.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://iamasuccessstory.com/</a> so just had to share the synchronicity.</div>
