<h1>The No S Diet</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2006-10-3 11:29</div>
<div class="content"><p>I’ve decided to start a new category “Road Tests” in which I try out various projects and products on myself or by myself. The first I want to start with is something called “The No S Diet” which was recommended by Mike Brown in the Readers’ Comments on my <a href="/blog/2006/9/28/its-not-an-option.html">No Options </a>article. The diet was invented by Reinhard Engels and you can read all about it at <a href="http://www.nosdiet.com/">www.nosdiet.com</a> (And by the way one of the great advantages of this new website for me is being able to get feedback and suggestions from readers - it’s a great way for me to learn from you)</p><p>Basically it consists of No Snacks, No Sweets and No Seconds. There is also an exception: you don’t follow the diet on “S Days”, which are defined as Saturdays, Sundays and Special Days (i.e. birthdays, Christmas, etc.).</p><p>To me this sounds eminently sensible. It’s more a set of guidelines than a diet. So I’m going to try it out and I will report back in one month’s time. If anyone wants to join me, feel free to make your commitment on the Comments.</p><p>And no, I have no intention of telling you lot what I weigh now!</p></div>

<div>Hi there Mark :)<br>This is the first time I've visited your site, so firstly,,,<br>Nice to meet you! :)<br><br>Yes indeed, NoS *is* eminently sensible! I've been with the NoS forum group for a little over two years, and I've dropped about 35-38 pounds.. Not one ounce has returned to me... This is the biggest selling point for me and it should be, for those fast diets but they just can't measure up, when you track long term success.. Permanent weight loss is possible with this oh so eminently sensible (and very enjoyable!) plan!<br>Something tells me, that you may just be our next "convert" Heh heh <br><br>Hope you have a great month and looking forward to hearing how your "Road trip" went here!<br>Please feel free to join our discussion group sometime at Everyday systems..<br>I'll be checking out your work as well..<br>I certainly can't claim to be one of those who "get's everything done" LOL..<br><br>Best wishes,<br>Debbie Feder<br>from Great Neck, NY</div>

<div>Dear Debbie. Thanks for your encouraging remarks and congratulations on the weight loss - that's a fantastic achievement! <br><br>Yes, I've already had a look at the forum, and I told Reinhard that I was starting the trial. I hope he might comment here some time.</div>

<div>Welcome aboard the No S diet, Mark.<br><br>Like yourself, I started the No S diet as a part of my blog. Later when I was hired to create the Health Hacks Podcast, Reinhard was one of the very first people I approached about becoming a contributor. He regualarly discusses his "Everyday Systems" for life improvement and I usually discuss either the No S diet or Urban Ranger (his walking for fitness system) as I apply them in my life.</div>

<div>Hi Mark,<br>I recently came across your blog and was curious if you're still following the No S Diet?  I started mine 3 weeks ago and so far so good! It really works for me and it's always nice to find other people who have tried it too!  Have a great weekend!</div>
