<h1>Dieting at Christmas - Final Report</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2007-01-2 12:46</div>
<div class="content"><p>I concluded the Christmas period with a big New Year's Eve dinner on Sunday and a big family lunch on New Year's Day. This morning when I weighed myself I was 1 lb <em>below</em> my target weight for the day. This means that since writing my first "Dieting at Christmas" post on <a href="/blog/2006/12/22/dieting-at-christmas.html">December 22nd</a> I have lost 3 lbs. Is this some sort of a record for Christmas dieting? It certainly is for me!</p><p>Mind you, for yesterday's lunch I had to refuse the pre-lunch nibbles, take only small portions of the starter and main course, refuse the puds and do without supper that evening. But in fact I found that I enjoyed the party even more for not stuffing myself, and doing without the evening meal was no real hardship. I did enjoy breakfast this morning though!</p><p>So the rules I have in force today are:</p><ol><li><div>No second helpings</div></li><li><div>No snacking (3 meals a day only)</div></li><li><div>No sweets</div></li><li><div>Small portions only</div></li></ol><p>The result of being under target today is that I feel very virtuous and, what's more, I really appreciate the reward of being able to drop the "Skip one meal" rule. As I said when I first suggested the idea of this diet, it seems to be a nice blend of carrot and stick. </p><p>I occupied myself yesterday evening in place of supper by writing all the daily target weights into my diary, right up to the time when I achieve my overall target. It is rather a good feeling being able to say within a pound or too exactly what weight I will be on any given day this year. Completion date is AUGUST 31st - you can work out for yourself how much weight I am planning to lose by then!</p><p><em>Full details of the diet I am following can be found </em><a href="/blog/2006/12/4/can-i-improve-on-the-no-s-diet.html"><font style="color: #0072bc" color="#0072bc"><u><em>here.</em></u></font></a></p></div>
