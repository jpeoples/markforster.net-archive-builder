<div class="content"><p>It’s never very long before the subject of David Allen’s “Getting Things Done” gets raised in discussion on this site. So it’s good news that, after a gap of many years, he has now written another book. I’ve just pre-ordered it from amazon.co.uk and I’ll be looking forward to reading it.</p><p>According to <a href="http://www.davidco.com/miaw.php" target="_blank">his website</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“Making It All Work” addresses: How to figure out where you are in life and what you need; How to be your own consultant and the CEO of your life; Moving from hope to trust in decision-making; When not to set goals; Harnessing intuition,spontaneity, and serendipity; And why life is like business and business is like life. <br></p></blockquote></div>
