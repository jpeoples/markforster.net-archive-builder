<div>When I used the system exactly as described the list became not longer that a handful of items. But I guess this has something to do with my hybrid system: I use a software/app (GoodTask for iOS) as a feeder tool. The app allows me to define all kinds of recurrences (ranging from daily on weekdays to every year on the last sunday), sending websites into a task, define start days for tasks I don‘t want to forget but cannot start yet (or don‘t want to). But for my day-to-day time management I recently returned to pen and paper. I feel much more in control compared to be „ruled“ by an app. Now I have modified the original „Get It Right Keep It Right“ as follows:  In the morning I transfer all tasks due today from GoodTask into my GiRKiR (the majority of them being daily tasks which I do not want to rewrite immediately since I don‘t want to do them twice a day). From there I use the system as described by Mark.</div>

You don't have to do a task every time you pass over it. You just leave it in place so it's there for you each day.<br><br>It's important to only add one task at a time though (I'm not sure whether you are doing this from your description). Otherwise it's just Simple Scanning by another name.</div>

<div>Sorry, if my description was not clear enough. Only in the morning I transfer a batch of tasks from the electronic system to my GiRKiR list. This way I ensure that everything which is due today is on the list. The rest of the day I use the system as described by Mark. I scan through the list, do what I  want to avoid not doing and when I reach the end of the list, I go to my app, select a task which I deem worthwhile to do soon, write it at the end of my GiRKiR list, don‘t do this task but instead start from the beginning of the list.</div>

<div>Yes going well and working, but my list is quite small being just a few broad headings – do email, do post, do project x, do project Y, do telephone call notes.<br>I think following the rules exactly means I don’t get to add small tasks as and when they crop up. At the moment it might take 2-3 days until I get to the end of the list. E.g. the email tasks usually takes 3-4 hours per day. Then I might work on project X and then project Y for the rest of the day.<br>Not a problem as things like telephone call notes all just go in a notebook and I can work through them when I get to that task on the list.<br>So it is turning into a sort of static checklist at the moment. Is that how it is supposed to work?<br>But it is working as I’m plate spinning on all the things I need to get done.</div>

<div>Yes, I think we are all different so some will build up long list and some short. For example, within my emails are loads of small tasks and I notice I get about 30 typically a day which generally get cleared in a few hours. I also email myself a lot with things to do so I’m sort of using email as a task list as well. As email are all neatly arranged in email, of course no point in transferring to the list.<br>So I think I am someone who does not create a long list as life is pretty simple (work, sofa, beer, repeat), but the system will flex to those that do so it should cater for all. Liking it so far and will continue using it and report back on anything interesting.</div>

<div>So far so good. I've had a pretty stable setup so things are pretty stable on the list. I think since this is the first time that I've done a long list in a long time that the list is still "stabilizing" a little bit and I'm still getting into the hang of using it. There are a few things that I've realized I was doing "off list" that I need to put and manage "on list" as they were a little out of control. I'm also working on doing the little and often thing, but at the moment my rate of list cycle is fast enough to keep up with the things that I'm doing. I think that I would be tempted to do even more cycles through the list if there were more things that I needed to do or add to the list, but that hasn't been happening right now. <br><br>One thing I have noticed, which I think has to do with the maturity of the list right now, is that I sometimes cycle through the whole list without adding anything and without doing anything yet because it's not quite ready, or because I have an intuition that something should be done, but I feel the need to "double check" the rest of my list first so I end up scanning my whole list first before I take action on the thing I want to start working on. I suspect that I might not need to do this as much if I were taking each action in smaller chunks, but a lot of the things I'm working on require a little more focus and deep investments of mental energy, so my "little and often" involves larger time blocks simply because those are the smallest units of time for which I can make meaningful progress. <br><br>Otherwise, my list isn't growing too quickly, and I'm staying up on things. It's also making me confront a few areas of my life where I don't think I was being honest about time commitments, and where I need to do some more re-evaluating, so that is good.</div>

<div>Aaron Hsu:<br><br><< my "little and often" involves larger time blocks simply because those are the smallest units of time for which I can make meaningful progress. >><br><br>"Little and often" is always a relative term. For instance I am just finishing Barbero's "Day of the Barbarian", which I've read a few pages at a time about five or six times a day. This is a very good way of reading a non-fiction book because it enables the mind to make mental links which it would otherwise miss.<br><br>On the other hand I'm also learning Turkish at the moment, which is completely new ground for me. I've never tried to learn an agglutinating language before. This I do in one or two sessions of 30 to 40 minutes a day. Again this is a good way of getting stuff to "stick".<br><br>My email is done in penny packets throughout the day and I always completely clear it each time. And the same with blog comments and other similar tasks.<br><br>So "little and often" should always be tailored to fit the task.</div>

In the morning I usually add 5 to 10 tasks and during the day another handful (following GiRKiR principles).</div>

<div>I have been revisiting past techniques that I used to use to get out of a lockdown rut. So I’m using Dreams. I have a Future vision and am self-coaching daily, my future self is so insightful. I am also using a “Mind Dump,” usually in the morning, where I just write down whatever comes to mind. I have also lost 13.5 pounds in 20 days and this is integrated into my vision. <br><br>So “all the good things since” I started this approach:<br>Songs writing from nowhere 15 songs<br>Unconscious retrieval – is amazing what my future self comes up with <br>Dreams I have started rereading the book<br>Ketogenic Diet and Weight Loss<br>Alcohol break I’ve continued on the wagon 35 days now<br>Bed early<br>I have cleaned the bathroom, the stairs twice, the kitchen once, and am chipping away at my home office.<br>Writing down ideas and insights<br>I think I have been more assistive at work. <br>Signed up for Mark Forster’s Lenten challenge. <br><br>I agreed to do something Dream-based every day. What areas are a struggle? Sometimes there is some resistance to self-coaching - which my future self-points out. I'm not reading as much as I would like. Need to work more on the objectives and make the vision more attractive. I need to start walking each day.</div>

<div>One thing I've noticed happening while I use GIRKIR is that sometimes I will go through the list in a cycle and nothing is up for more action, and then I'll add one to the list, and cycle through again, get to this item, and then realize that this isn't really appropriate to action yet, and then add another item, and repeat this process maybe once or twice. This ends up adding a couple of things in quick succession as I'm sort of "exploring" my space further and finding those things that are missing on my list, but that aren't in there yet, and discovering timing dependencies on various new items. <br><br>I think this is only happening on occasion as I get things totally in control and then some of the other things that were waiting in the wings requires some thinking about new processes. I imagine that this will happen less often as my list matures further.</div>

<div>Aaron Hsu:<br><br>I don't know how many tasks you've got on your list at the moment, but I think this would be a fairly common experience when the list is still small. It's an opportunity to get rid of some small one-offs though.</div>

<div>Hello,<br><br>I haven't been very disciplined with the method, but I like it so far. One question, the task that is added has to be something that you're going to take action on right away?<br><br>So, if I add, sweep kitchen, that means that on the next pass I have to do something about it?<br><br>Best,</div>

<div>Eugenia:<br><br><< the task that is added has to be something that you're going to take action on right away? >><br><br>Technically no, you don't have to. But since the idea of the system is to get something right and then keep it right, there doesn't seem to be much point in entering something you're not going to start getting right yet. Better to use the slot for something you *can* start work on.</div>

<div>Mark:<br><br>My list is currently staying very small, and I kind of like it that way. ;-) <br><br>Eugenia:<br><br>As I talk about above, I've found that sometimes I add something to the list and then immediately realize that I need to do something else first, so I end up circling the list once or twice and adding some things in that don't get actioned immediately.</div>

<div>>> The whole idea is not to spend hours on a task before you move on to the next one but to circulate rapidly through the tasks spending a relatively small amount of time on each one in turn. <<<br><br>As far as I understand the system by now, when you enter a task as the new task and then later on work on it for the first time, you work on it until you "Got It Right" and only then, in subsequent list circling you work a bit to "Keep It Right."<br><br>So this could mean to work on a, say, clearing your email inbox for hours in order to Get It Right.<br><br>Otherwise you will enter a new task at the end of the list, without everything else on the list already "righted." You accumulate a a bunch of not-righted tasks, just because you passed trough the list. The trigger for entering a new task should be that everything on the list is now kept right and you can add something more.</div>

What you must do is ensure that it is getting emptier each pass.<br><br><< Otherwise you will enter a new task at the end of the list, without everything else on the list already "righted." >><br><br>That's correct.

<div>This is sounding more and more like something I should try. I've done an informal version of this in some areas before, but stopped too soon.<br><br>When my current system loses it's shiny newness (hopefully it will last the Lenten Challenge), this will be a top candidate.</div>

<div>I'm finding that the hardest thing right now is applying Little and Often to those things that aren't quite "mainstream" on my list. I don't think that this is something inherent to the system though. However, i find that I have some things on my list that have made it there because of the process, but which, when I look at them, I resist because I feel like I have to "do something significant" on them instead of just "do something" with them. A few of them, I've finally just got into the habit of realizing that I don't have to do everything on them, and in so doing, I've managed to get these to the point that they take only a few minutes a day to keep up to date. <br><br>Others are the sort that have no real "end point" because they are creative endeavors or the like where I can't really set a target (not even something like, "write 200 words" or the like, simply because it's not really meant that way), and there, I often find myself arguing myself out of not doing them, even though when I do them I know I like myself better at the end of the day. The challenge right now is remembering Little and Often and that it's okay if I even do, say, the most trivial thing with these tasks, and I can still mark them off and I'll be happier at the end of the day for having done anything with them at all. <br><br>I'm starting to make headway with these, in part because I hate seeing them languish on the list, but also because I've been able to re-evaluate a little bit what "keep it right" means to me with regards to these tasks.</div>

<div>One challenge that I set for myself this time around (I have entered the Lenten Challenge multiple time, but never finished) is that I won´t give up as soon as I go off the rails with the system I choose. Not an "all or nothing" approach this time.<br><br>So I´m using the Get It Right system, but I´ve had to restart a couple of times, and that´s ok. It´s better than abandoning the challenge!<br><br>Best,</div>

<div>I had a hard job deciding whether to do GIRKIR or SNL for the Lenten Challenge.  (SNL has been my go-to system for quite a while now - thanks Seraphim). <br><br>In the days leading up to the start of the challenge, I tried out GIRKIR, but I wasn't confident I'd be able to sustain it for 6 weeks.  My biggest worries were not being able to capture everything onto the list, and only being able to add one new task when the end of the list was reached.  For the first two days I tried running an SNL list alongside the GIRKIR list - as I was afraid of forgetting tasks, and not feeling confident that I would do tasks in the correct priority if I didn't have a full SNL list that captured all my potential tasks/projects.  Then I tried GIRKIR without the SNL side-list, but used the humble post-it note stuck on my PC for things I absolutely shouldn't forget to do.<br><br>I felt that using the SNL side-list was maybe a tweak too far, and not really in the spirit of the new system.  What finally made up my mind to try GIRKIR for the challenge was that, in a reply to Seraphim about similar difficulties, Mark had posted the following, which seemed to give the OK to using SNL as a side-list to use for choosing the one task to GIRKIR at the appropriate time:<br><br>"Seraphim:<br><br>What I do, once I'm past the obvious things is jot down on a small piece of paper the things I really don't want to forget. I then enter them one by one on the main list.<br><br>Currently I have 26 tasks on the main list and 9 on the reminder note.<br><br>The beauty of Get It Right - Keep It Right is not in the selection process but in how well it processes stuff once it gets on the main list. So it doesn't really matter how you choose the one task per pass. You could even use Serial No-List for that purpose."<br>( February 15, 2021 at 9:58 | Mark Forster )<br><br>I'm still finding GIRKIR a bit of a challenge (no pun intended): I'm finding it hard to decide whether to put on tasks at a general level (do housework) or at an individual level (clean bathroom).  I'm leaning a bit more towards the general level, so that when I come to “do housework” I have a checklist to decide what particular task to work on.  Is that still within the spirit of the system?</div>

You may want to use a different level depending on whether it needs "getting right" or whether it just needs "keeping right". <br><br>For instance, if I'm sorting out an untidy office, I might start with putting "Sort Office" on my list and might end up with a whole series of tasks like "Tidy Desk", "Put Away Papers", "Clean Floor", which each take no more than a few minutes, or even seconds.<br><br>The sorting process takes a long time, but once something is sorted it can be kept that way easily, particularly if you deal with it on a "little and often" basis.<br><br>But regardless of how you choose to split up the tasks, it's still within the spirit of the system.</div>

<div><< I don't know about trivia, but without processing maintenance tasks how will you succeed in doing the important stuff? >><br><br>I should have been more clear:  I found myself focusing *too much* on maintenance tasks. For example, checking my email far more often than I really needed. <br><br>It worked something like this: I found myself acting in a more reactive way, looking for external stimulus. I think that was the outcome of being limited to one new thing at a time. My mind just doesn't work that way. I need to get everything out on the table where I can see it and sort through it, try this, try that, till the natural focus emerges. Finding it difficult to do that, I kept doing the easy things like checking the email, washing the dishes, shredding papers, etc., when those things could have easily waited.</div>

I have multiple one-off tasks and ongoing projects that haven't been touched over the last 11 days – so far without any bad consequences, but they can't stay undone indefinitely.<br><br>It's not the fault of the system itself, but of the operator!  I obviously haven't been entering the right tasks in order for me to have a productive day.  I've been entering them at an individual level but that got too clunky, and then I tried entering them at a broader level, and that got too hazy. <br><br>I've experimented with using a full-capture side-list (SNL) to feed the main list but that didn't work as well as I'd hoped, and I've also experimented with using a short as a reminder note for “must do today” tasks.  The SNL list is great for capturing everything I don't want to forget, and ranges from someday/maybe tasks and projects with no deadline, through to “must do today” tasks – but it felt like too much overhead to use it to feed the main list.<br><br>However, I'll keep experimenting – I'm determined to stick it out with the Lenten Challenge this year.</div>

<div>Thanks, Mark.  I'll give that suggestion a try.  <br><br>I also meant to ask earlier: I'm assuming that any task that needs doing "now" just gets done straightaway outwith the list, as in most of your other systems.  I suppose if I wanted to keep strictly to the system, it could be added to the end of the list then you could scan from your current position down to that task, knowing all the while that you weren't going to action any of the scanned tasks.  That would mean you get to add another new task because you've (artificially) reached the end of the list - though maybe that's not a bad thing.</div>

<div>Something that is coming up as I am finally getting my list matured. There are a couple of "stragglers" in my list that are hanging around a while. Some of them seem like good candidates for deletion. Some are things that are just waiting, but they require a bit of "things to be right" and they might have to be scheduled to get them there because they require a bit more coordination. But one or two things are hanging out there that I find myself resisting, but also strongly resisting taking off the list. I'm not sure that this is directly related to GIRKIR, but in the spirit of "keeping things right" I feel a little out of synch. These are items that when I dig into why I'm resisting them, I think it's fundamentally because I don't feel that other things on my list are right enough to warrant me spending time on these things, which are more like things that don't have to be done at all, but that I want to do, but that I don't want to sacrifice other things in order to do. So, in a sense, these things are already "up to date", and I don't have to take any action on them, and there are other things to take action on, but it still bothers me both to take action on them and to not take action on them, and I certainly feel bothered by the idea of taking them off the list. <br><br>At the moment, this means they stay on the list, but unactioned, but I'm not sure how I feel about that. Sometimes even spending a little bit of time on them feels like too much taken away from other things that seem more pressing. Suggestions?</div>

<div>Aaron Hsu - <br><br>Sounds like you have a conflict going on. <br><br>To sort out things like this, I use the conflict process I described in another thread recently. Whenever something on my list feels persistently "stuck", or I start feeling unfocused or overwhelmed, I use this process. It not only gives a sense of relief, but also a new sense of focus and direction. <br><br>Not sure if it will do that for anyone else, but it works great for me!<br><br>The process is great at getting things unstuck, but even more importantly, helps to elucidate deeper motivations, aspirations, unverbalized fears, hidden obstacles and assumptions. It combines all the different aspects of "standing out" and "what are you resisting not doing", as well as identifying the positive reasons for any inertia you may be experiencing, and whatever forces there are that keep pushing you away from your aspirations back to your inertial starting place.<br><br>The process takes some practice but can usually provide useful insights after 10-15 minutes or so. Here are the steps:<br><br>(1) Describe (in a short paragraph) your undesirable situation (the fear, the pain, the frustration, the vicious cycle, how it impacts you, how it blocks you from doing what you want to do). When I am facing the kind of thing you describe -- a handful of tasks that I can't bring myself to complete, but neither can I just drop them -- I try to do a brain dump of whatever comes to mind that is bothering me about this situation. What bothers me about these tasks? Why do I want to do them? Why do they keep coming to mind, but I can't do anything about them? Why can't I just delete them? Just do some free-writing -- a short paragraph trying to express some of that.<br><br>(2) Look back over what you wrote in (1), and describe (in one sentence) the most important need that is jeopardized by this situation<br><br>(3) What key action do you want to take in order to satisfy (2) ?  (Maybe one of the tasks that's stuck; maybe not)<br><br>(4) Describe (in one sentence) the most important need that prevents you from doing (3)<br><br>(5) What key action do you take to satisfy (4) ?<br><br>(6) What is the common need satisfied by both (2) and (4)?<br><br><br>Typically you end up with a succinct definition of your conflict. You need (2) and (4) -- but to get them, you need to do (3) and (5), and you CAN'T do both (3) and (5) because they are mutually exclusive.<br><br>If the way you wrote it doesn't give you a clear sense of the conflict, try to rewrite it so that the conflict becomes more clear:<br>-- (2) and (4) are *required* to realize (6)<br>-- (3) is *required* for (2) but threatens (4)<br>-- (5) is *required* for (4) but threatens (3)<br>-- (3) and (5) are mutually exclusive<br><br>If you explore the Important Needs a little more deeply, you can usually find a good solution that eliminates the conflict. Ask yourself -- why do you want Important Need (4)? Why do you want to escape from it? Then ask -- why do you want Important Need (2)? Why do you avoid it?<br><br>(2) usually represents an aspiration -- the ideal future state you are trying to achieve. But it also comes with risks, dangers, unknowns, fears, or other negative side effects that block you from achieving it and push you back to your inertial state.<br><br>(4) generally describes that inertial state. For all its problems, there are positive things about your inertial state. It is generally well-known and familiar ("the devil you know"). It represents a kind of security. But it also has a lot of negative side effects. These are all the negative results of doing nothing -- of staying where you are -- the things that cause you to "resist not doing" the aspirational thing that will get you out of this situation.<br><br>After you explore the Important Needs and ask yourself those questions, scan back through your answers and look for **behaviors** -- things you can control. Those behaviors can give you the clue that leads you to eliminate the conflict. Not just find the best compromise -- but break the vicious cycle altogether that is keeping you stuck in your inertial state and blocking you from realizing your aspiration. Look for the behaviors you can challenge -- sometimes they just look silly after you write them down, and it's obvious how you can fix them.<br><br>If this works for you as well as it generally works for me, you'll not only get new insights about the tasks that are bothering you, but lots of other things as well that can help you get a real breakthrough with whatever is causing you to get stuck.</div>

<div>Aaron Hsu:<br><br>This sounds like a straightforward binary choice for each of the tasks. <br><br>1) Take it off the list<br><br>2) Leave it on the list<br><br>Neither choice will have disastrous results as you can reverse it easily, although putting a deleted task back on the list may take time while leaving a task on the list unactioned is against the spirit of GIRKIR (though the GIRKIR police have other priorities at the moment)..<br><br>I note that you said that spending even a little bit of time on the tasks would feel like time taken away from other things.

<div>Okay, something is coming up using GIRKIR that always comes up when I run off of a long list system. The whole point of such a system, as I understand it, is that it's a "time management system" that is supposed to assist with making the decisions about what to do at any given moment when I get to choose what to do. Well, I'm in the position (privileged?) of having almost 100% discretionary time. This means that under this system, as I understand it, it encompasses almost all of my activities. However, in working the system, I'm finding that I'm struggling a little bit with maintaining a consistent sleep schedule and with allocating the amount of time that I spend on any given thing. <br><br>I *think* that this might be a signal that I am trying to spend too much time on too many things, but it's not clear to me from a systems point of view what the appropriate "actions" to take are when I encounter a situation like this, where some tasks are eating up too much time, and where some actions (such as "Sleep") are not getting the right amounts of time dedicated to them at the right times in the day. What's the meta-level approach when using GIRKIR to address this? <br><br>Obviously, there are approaches I could take simply by recognizing that this is happening and then taking steps outside of the system, but I'm trying to understand how best to work within the system rather than trying to "break it" or work outside of it. I already have identified another problem I have with having a tendency to do things outside of the system (which then get away from me) rather than inside and under the management of the system.</div>

<div>Thanks for the clarification re: sleep, Mark. The main problem items are things like "communications" tasks. This might be forums or email. The issue is that I have a hard time starting the task and then finishing it "before its done" in a sense. I end up spending more time than I realize on those tasks, but I find that even if I say, "I'll just spend 30 minutes on this," I will often ignore my own timebox and keep going. This usually happens with some long reply or email I'm writing. Sometimes it's "worth it" because it's work, but other times I am convinced I could have paced out the work somehow and finished other things rather than letting those other things languish to get that email written. There is a balance here on how much I do that I haven't quite figured out (I have a tendency to work long on single items, becuase I get sucked into them) and this would seem to be for items that should be inside of the system. Almost all of the things that I do outside of the system are the sorts of things that absolutely belong inside the system as they represent discretionary activities that need to be actioned in a balanced manner in congruence with my other discretionary activities. They aren't in the system because they serve as mental distraction for myself that I don't want to "wait" for putting them on the list, when in reality they really should be put there, because I would be more intentional about dealing with them and they wouldn't have the power to derail my work.</div>

If that's not working for you then you might try time blocking the type of task which is causing you this trouble.<br><br>The way you do it is to start with a timed period of 5 minutes. When you reach the end of the 5 minutes, you have a choice. You either stop working, or commit yourself to a new immediate time block - this time of 10 minutes. When you reach the end of the 10 minutes (assuming you haven't finished the task) you commit yourself to another time box, this time of 15 minutes. And so you continue, committing yourself to a new time box each time of 5 minutes longer than the previous one.<br><br>The point is that it forces to commit yourself each time to an exact period if you want to continue This is very different from "ignoring my own timebox and keeping going", where you fail to commit yourself and just carry on for an indeterminate period.</div>

<div>I still want to try to make the system work using the "work as long as I want to" rule, because I just hate the time boxing stuff, even the way that you describe it. <br><br>It's still not exactly clear to me what things should go on the list or not. In my case, with maximal discretionary time, it's important to me that the system I use is capable of handling as much "in system" as I can. I can see the point of having things with fixed schedules outside of the list, which makes sense, but what about things that have a tendency to be done during certain times of day or at certain cadences, but that you wouldn't want to commit to doing at a fixed time? For example, I could think of hygiene tasks that you might do at night, but which aren't necessarily something you would do at the same time each night (shower, shave, brush teeth), or about regular breaks for tea or just taking a mental break throughout the day. Are those things you put out of the system or something that you would put into the system? It seems desirable for me to be able to put something like "break/tea" in the list. <br><br>Then there's the quesiton of items that are a part of "work" versus those things that are "personal". For me, sometimes the line is a little blurred, and I generally don't seem to do well with trying to segregate things out into "work lists" vs. "personal lists" and then working on one then the other, but what do you recommend in this regard? <br><br>For example, at varying times, I sometimes have a tendency for work items to take over personal items in time, or the opposite occurs and I do too much personal items and not enough work items. I feel like I'd prefer a system that allowed me to intuitively balance these inside of a single system, especially since work and personal items can be intermingled throughout my day and they are all "discretionary time" based tasks.</div>

In my case, with maximal discretionary time, it's important to me that the system I use is capable of handling as much "in system" as I can. >><br><br>It's an important principle in time management that your system is there to help you do your work, not to get in the way of your doing your work, This applies especially to a system like GIRKIR, which is not very time sensitive. By which I mean that, if what you should be doing is at the opposite end of the list from where you are on the list, it's the list that has to give, not the work.<br><br>If you have a time clash, you basically have two ways of dealing with it:<br><br>1) You work on the principle "If it needs doing now, do it now". You step out of the list, do the needed work and go back to the list where you left off.<br><br>or<br><br>2) You stay in the list, but make a long jump to the task(s) which you need to do, and then carry on from there.<br><br>The basic difference between the two methods is what you do after you've done the urgent work. With 1) you re-start from where you were *before* doing the urgent work. With 2) you re-start from where you are *after* doing the urgent work.<br><br>Personally I put everything I can on the list and use 1) for something which is not on the list, and 2) for something which is, but is in the wrong place. This is a guide rather than a hard-and-fast rule though.<br><br>As far as the rest of the points you make go, I tend to make no distinction between personal and work items. I want them all to get done, so why differentiate? That  would of course be different for someone in employment.<br><br>However I don't put on the list things which I do more or less automatically. That would include getting dressed, having a shower, cleaning my teeth, making a cup of tea and so on.</div>

<div>Mark:<br><br>Thanks a bunch for taking the time to elucidate these points! I think I've got a better picture of the "system as a whole" now. As an application of this, i sometimes have things on the list that I sort of feel I should do right now, or that I want to do right now, but they are "far away" on the list. In this case, you're saying that it's perfectly "in system" to make a long jump to that item without scanning the rest of the list for something else first, do that thing, and then keep scanning from that point? I mostly feel this desire when I feel that things are out of order for me, such as me really wanting to do X before Y, even though i could do both at this point.</div>

<div>Mark, since you said that you don't include everything on the list that you do more or less automatically, I'm going to experiment with that approach. <br><br>Whatever system I'm using, I usually see it as a 24/7, fully-comprehensive one, but that can lead to more overhead, which is what I've found with GIRKIR.<br><br>I'll just ask myself "Would I be doing this task anyway, no matter what system (or none) I'm using?".  If the answer is yes, it won't go on my GIRKIR list.</div>

<div>During the Lenten challenge, I have used GIRKIR very little, mainly because the work to be done has been obvious and in my face. When I've had discretionary time, I've chosen to rest because that's what was needed most. When urgencies sprang up, I went off the list and handled them immediately.<br><br>Today, though, I'm mostly caught up on everything (that will last for a perfect 20 minutes) and so it's the perfect time to ask The Question, write down two tasks, and commence breaking down those resistant tasks. <br><br>Thanks to michael for resurrecting Mark's old blog post on "use checklists to beat procrastination" blog; that actually helped get me unstuck on something.</div>

<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Aaron Hsu - 2021-03-12 11:19</div>
<div>Mark:<br><br>I've got to admit that I'm still struggling a little bit to understand the contents of a long list, the little and often principle, the "do it for as long as I feel like", and the idea of discretionary time being managed by the long list as a "time management system." <br><br>To put it simply, let's just categorize tasks into one of leisure or work. Leisure could be tasks like eating, drinking, resting, watching youtube, reading forums, blogs, &c., And then there is the work stuff, which are various projects, whether personal or professional that represent things that produce value or that you do in exchange for money or are things that otherwise keep the wheels spinning (such as cleaning out the office or the like). <br><br>Here, I'll put the key difference between leisure and work is that leisure activities, for the most part, are not the sort of things that are *essential* to maintaining forward momentum in your life, perhaps with the exception of eating, but I'm including that here because the act of eating for me can often be a leisure activity rather than a required activity done for continued survival. Work activities, on the other hand, have some level of necessity attached to them because if I don't do these things with some degree of regularity and consistency, bad things happen, or, put in a more positive light, the degree to which my life gets better over time can at least be assumed to be relatively proportional to the amount of quality attention that is put into the "work" categories. <br><br>The problem I'm having is that you would, at least from the way I understand it, want to put your leisure activities (the discretionary time ones) onto your long list, because these are things that you are committed to doing (such as a hobby) and that bring you enjoyment, and are not something that you would want to give up. Obviously your work items also go on the long list. They all represent commitments, and I wouldn't want to go without my leisure activities, but I also can't give up my work activities (partly because I enjoy some of them, but also because they keep me able to do things I enjoy in the future, since, for instance, I get paid by those activities). <br><br>Now, the problem I see here is that I don't understand how one would keep things in balance. If I follow the little and often and the "do it as long as you want" or really any other "time management" strategy at some level is, well, what on earth will motivate me in the moment to stop doing the leisure activities sufficiently often to let me do significantly more work activities? <br><br>For example, say I've got a highly addictive forum, or video game, or YouTube, or book, or something else that I really want to read and work with. Well, I could easily spend 2 - 10 hours at a stretch just doing that one thing, without once feeling the desire to stop. And maybe I might be able to go 1 to 3 hours at a stretch on my work task that makes me money. But if I just work a long list and do things along that list, it's very likely that I'll just end up spending significantly more time on my leisure activities than I would on my work, to the point where the work probably wouldn't get done to a sufficient level to ensure long term success. <br><br>I guess the question comes down to, how do you avoid the procrastination on getting sufficient amount of work done while also feeling that you aren't being jipped on your "play time" and *still* get to bed at a reasonable hour? <br><br>At least for me, there are so many things to study in my leisure time that I never feel satisfied with the amount of attention that I'm giving there, but I also never feel satisfied with the amount of attention that I'm giving to my work either. The long list system seems to encourage me to spend too much time on procrastinating on my real work because the real work is harder by spending too much time on the interesting novelties that are my leisure work. <br><br>One solution might be to cut out things that are taking up too much time, such as YouTube, but at the same time, that strikes me as unsatisfactory. I want balance here, not total depravation. Isn't that the whole point of a time management system? The results for me, far too often, are that I simply try to push more hours into the day, and choose not to sleep. <br><br>I've tried timeboxing, but that doesn't seem to work because it's just an artificial limit I'm putting on myself. Why should I listen to some stupid rule that I made up for myself? <br><br>This seems to me to be the biggest issue with almost all time management systems I've seen: in the end, once the time management system stops me from "having fun" or "doing what I want to do" then my mind says, "This is just some stupid set of rules you made up, you can break them, too." My system might tell me that I should do X, but why should I even bother listening to it? I'd rather do Y, even if I know in the long term it won't be very good for me. How on earth are you spposed to deal with that?</div>

<div>Mark:<br><br>Thanks! I'll definitely be thinking about it. <br><br>On another note, you mentioned indirectly the "system" around the time management system, which are things that happen automatically or that are organized and managed outside of the TMS.  Do you have anywhere where you document how this whole system of systems fits together in your mind? From what I can tell the components are at least:<br><br>1. A calendar for tracking appointments, dated reminders, and other time-dependent things.<br>2. An authorized commitments list.<br>3. A daily structure of at least regular sleep and wake schedule and eating schedule.<br>4. Journaling, awareness, self-reflection habits.<br><br>I imagine that most of #4 could either be put on a calendar or in the list, but it seems to me that you might suggest putting it on the list instead of trying to schedule it, since it's technically discretionary, yes? <br><br>I think I understand #1 and #2 reasonably well, but I wonder if you might expand on #3 in terms of a daily structure. There are many people in the self-management space that strongly advocate for scheduling and timeboxing, but I get the distinct impression from your writing that you tend to emphasize the opposite, that of minimizing your scheduled time and maximizing discretionary time. However, it seems like you also don't believe in *no* structure, so, what do you think is the right structure to one's time (daily, weekly, or any other time span, really) and how does one go about determining this? What's the principle here that requires something to be structured vs. just intuitively actioned on a list?</div>

<div>When I go back to my GIRKIR list at the start of a new day, I've got quite a few tasks that no longer feel relevant: they definitely need to be got right and kept right, but not necessarily in the next couple of days, and certainly not before other tasks and projects that now feel more important or more urgent.  They must have just sprung to mind on previous days at the point where I was trying to decide what to add next to the list.  I feel I haven't mastered how to add the “right” things to the list.<br><br>This is probably not the fault of the system itself; it's more that I have a lot of projects and tasks that need to be done; <br><br>some have a definite (or self-imposed) deadline and others can wait; <br><br>some require that other people are borne in mind and others are purely personal to me and won't affect other people; <br><br>some need to be got right (often from a state of severe backlog) and kept right, while others are up to date but need to be kept that way.<br><br><br>These factors would be in play whatever time management system I'm using, but I'm starting to feel that GIRKIR may not be that system.  However, I'm happy to be proved wrong, and having got this far with the Lenten challenge, I'm going to keep at it.</div>

You shouldn't have anything on your list which you don't want to be working on at the moment. You can put them back on the list when the time is right.</div>
