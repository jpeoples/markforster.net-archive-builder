<div class="content"><p>The first translation of the Revised Autofocus System instructions is in <a href="http://www.selgepilt.ee/2009/07/29/mark-forsteri-autofocuse-taiendatud-versioon-toimib/">Estonian</a>. A fantastic effort by <span>Kristjan Otsmann!</span></p>
<p><span>Translations of the instructions are very welcome. You can either send them to me or (preferably) put them on your own website and send me the link.</span></p>
<p><span>Can we beat the 16 translations that were done for Autofocus 1? They were Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Czech, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish and Turkish. </span></p>
<p><span>All were done by volunteers acting on their own initiative.</span></p></div>
