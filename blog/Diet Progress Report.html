<h1>Diet Progress Report</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2008-04-1 16:12</div>
<div class="content"><p>My diet is still going strong, and I am right on target having lost 12 lbs in the 12 weeks since the beginning of the year.</p><p>One problem that I am coming across is an increasing tendency to cheat. The trouble is that after one has cheated once it becomes easier to cheat the next time. Cheating of course is self-defeating in this diet as all that happens is that the rules get tighter and tighter.</p><p>So I am going to be really strict with myself from now on: NO CHEATING! </p><p>(Full details of the diet I have been following are given in my article <em><a href="/blog/2006/12/4/can-i-improve-on-the-no-s-diet.html">Can I Improve on the “No S” Diet</a>.)</em></p><p><em>Related: </em></p><p><a href="/blog/category/dieting">Other posts about dieting</a></p>

<div>Sonja Lyubomirsky's remarkable new book has a possible answer to this. She quotes a diet guru who found his students were cheating because they were getting bored with the diet -- just as everyone gets bored with doing anything for any length of time (Sonja and other positive psychologists call it the hedonic treadmill). <br><br>So why not try changing the diet? Maybe that will keep you interested so you will be less likely to cheat,<br><br>Last year I tried a crash diet to lose 10lbs in five weeks. This year (having put it on again!) I'm aiming to lose 1lb a month. So far so good!<br><br></div>

<div>This would be "The How of Happiness", would it?<br><br><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1847441939/026-1386493-4534806?ie=UTF8&tag=markforstthet-21&linkCode=xm2&camp=1634&creativeASIN=1847441939" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1847441939/026-1386493-4534806?ie=UTF8&tag=markforstthet-21&linkCode=xm2&camp=1634&creativeASIN=1847441939</a><br><br>I've not read it but it sounds interesting. Good luck with the new diet.</div>

<div>Hi Mark,<br><br>I've looked at the diet.  I like it.  It's simple and yet uncompromising.  <br><br>I take it one drops the rules at the bottom of the list first.  I'm not sure I could make a habit of 'skipping all meals'!<br><br>Regards,<br>Melissa.<br><br></div>

<div>Hi, Melissa<br><br>Yes, you've got it! The rules are cumulative and you add them one at a time. Then you take them off one at a time in the same order you put them on.<br><br>Actually I've never yet got as far as skipping all meals!</div>

<div>Hi Mark,<br><br>I'm sorry vanilla No-s didn't do the trick for you -- though I take some comfort in the thought that your successful, heavily-modded personal version at least took inspiration from it.<br><br>As for your compliance difficulties, I came up with a concept/tool called the "Habit Calendar" which I think might help.<br><br>The basic idea is for every new behavior you're trying to turn into a habit, you mark each day green/yellow/red for success/exempt/failure (the "habit traffic light"). You can use a paper calendar and colored markers, or the free online version here:<br><br><a href="http://everydaysystems.com/habitcal" rel="nofollow">http://everydaysystems.com/habitcal</a><br><br>Hope this helps -- best of luck in any case!<br><br>Reinhard<br><br>P.S. The No S Diet book is now out -- not sure if it'll make vanilla any tastier to you, but people tell me it's  entertaining even if they don't wind up following the system to the letter.</div>

<div>Hi, Reinhard<br><br>Yes, there's not a great deal of resemblance left between "my" diet and your orginal No-S. It reminds me of the many attempts that people come up with to combine Do It Tomorrow with Getting Things Done. The result may work for them, but I always feel they've missed the point of DIT!</div>

<div>Hi Mark,according to me dieting is not at all a problem.It will be easier until we cheat. when we start cheating ourselves,its a great loss for us only.</div>
