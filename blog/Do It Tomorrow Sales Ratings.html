<div>Its good to hear that Do it tomorrow is rising up the amazon.co.uk ranks, however I'm surprised that is on over 4 week availability on amazon.com<br><br>I have used Do it tomorrow and get everything done extensively in the development of my organisation system so talk about them a lot on my blog, as the majority of my readership is from USA it is frustrating that they would struggle to purchae your books from amazon.com<br><br></div>

<div>It is frustrating - especially to the author!<br><br>Sadly no American distributor has taken the book on.<br><br>I usually advise people in the States to use one of the sellers under "More Buying Choices" and to go for one who actually has the book in stock in the States.</div>
