<h1>The Longest Day</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2006-12-7 11:38</div>
<div class="content"><p>Establishing a new structure for my day has brought back into my consciousness something I had forgotten. Yesterday was the first day of switching my computer on at 9 am and switching it off at 6 pm. At the end of the day I looked back and thought how long the day seemed. I have got so used to days passing like a flash that this came as quite a surprise. It shouldn't have, because I am always teaching other people that you get more done by limiting your working day. Yet, having let it lapse a bit in my own life, I was surprised again by just how much difference it does make.</p></div>
