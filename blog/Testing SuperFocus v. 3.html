<h1>Testing SuperFocus v. 3</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2011-01-29 21:46</div>
<div class="content"><p>As has been mentioned several times in the <a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/category/review-of-systems">review of the systems</a>, there is a revision of <a href="../general_forum/Rules for SuperFocus - 2nd Revision.html">SuperFocus</a> being tested at the moment by me which promises to solve all the problems which the other systems have.</p>
<p>I have been testing it now for eight days. I set myself several benchmarks, all of which so far have progressed extemely well. You can read about the testing <a href="../general_forum/SuperFocus - Forthcoming 3rd Revision.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>The new rules only effect the way in which the second column in <a href="../general_forum/Rules for SuperFocus - 2nd Revision.html">SuperFocus</a> is used. The basic structure of SuperFocus remains unchanged. However, although the change is relatively minor, the effect is enormous. I really believe that the perfect balance between easy tasks and difficult tasks, and urgent tasks and non-urgent tasks can be achieved through this system.</p>
<p>I’m now going to set myself a few more goals to be carried out through the use of the system. These will include more frequent blogging, getting my newsletter moving again, arranging some seminars and re-orientating my website to the new system.</p>
<p>I see these as part of the testing of the system. So you can see for yourself what the system is capable of achieving.</p></div>
