<h1>Correspondence Received</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2007-03-13 10:35</div>
<div class="content"><p>Mark, </p><p>Its no exaggeration to say that <a href="http://astore.amazon.co.uk/markforstthet-21/detail/0340746203/202-5898521-9023047" target="_blank"><em>Get Everything Done</em> </a>and <em><a href="http://astore.amazon.co.uk/markforstthet-21/detail/0340909129/202-5898521-9023047" target="_blank">Do it Tomorrow</a></em> have totally changed my life. </p><p>I assumed I was a reasonably bright guy who just wasn’t much good at getting things done. With phrases like “he is not a completer finisher” and “he is great at the ideas, just no good at seeing them through” ringing in my ears from various appraisals, I figured it was worth a shot. Your book, as I am sure you don’t need telling, hits the nail on the head. So many time-management systems.. but none actually work. </p><p>Your books have made me efficient when I am working, got me started when I am not, and cherishing both my attention and time far more than I ever have done before. </p><p>I was just mid-way through a report I’ve been putting off writing for some time. Finally I got it started thanks to a checklist and some 5 minute bursts (just creating a blank document and just saving it with the right filename was the first). Now its nearly complete, my 10 minute timer just beeped, and although I was keen to carry on typing, I’ve stopped mid-sentence to thank you… </p><p>I just thought my character was flawed and that was what life was gonna be like, thanks for showing me it isn’t. </p><p>best regards, </p><p>Andy (a massive fan) </p><p>Andy Roberts, IT Consultant </p><p><em>[Quoted by permission]</em></p></div>
