<h1>Alexa Tool Bar</h1>

<div class="content"><p>Thanks to a fantastic little tool available from <a href="http://www.alexa.com/"><u><font style="color: #0000ff" color="#0000ff">http://www.alexa.com/</font></u></a>, I now know that this site ranks <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial; mso-ansi-language: en-gb; mso-fareast-font-family: 'times new roman'; mso-fareast-language: en-us; mso-bidi-language: ar-sa"><font face="Verdana"><strong>222,497th </strong>for traffic on the internet!</font></span></p><p><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial; mso-ansi-language: en-gb; mso-fareast-font-family: 'times new roman'; mso-fareast-language: en-us; mso-bidi-language: ar-sa"><font face="Verdana">This figure sounds huge until you remember that there are millions and millions of sites out there. In fact this is an extremely good ranking for an individual's site.</font></span></p><p><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial; mso-ansi-language: en-gb; mso-fareast-font-family: 'times new roman'; mso-fareast-language: en-us; mso-bidi-language: ar-sa"><font face="Verdana">Anyway you can prove that for yourself by downloading the <u><font style="color: #0000ff" color="#0000ff"><a href="http://download.alexa.com/index.cgi" class="offsite-link-inline" target="_blank">Alexa toolbar</a> </font></u>entirely free of charge, and looking up all your favourite sites. And if you've got your own site, see how it compares with all your friends' sites. You may be in for a few surprises!</font></span></p></div>

<div>I knew that there was all sorts of stats-fun to be had at the Alexa site (I've written reviews and looked up rankings there), but I don't have the toolbar.  I'm curious about the differences between the site and the toolbar, so I might have to download it.  :)</div>

<div>Hi, Sarah<br><br>The main difference is that if you have the toolbar you can see instantly what the ranking is for any site that you visit. You don't have to go to the Alexa site to do so. <br><br>Besides being fun, it is very useful in judging the credibility of a site.</div>
