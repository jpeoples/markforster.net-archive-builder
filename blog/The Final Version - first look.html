<div>All right!! I see a running list with some dots and lines, no highlighter, no dates or symbols or tricky tags ... as clean as can be! (... or is that a dot I see in the upper right corners?

<div>Not sure that I'm too keen on long lists anymore and it looks a little bit like that - possibly with several items selected at once. I suppose because I have so many scheduled tasks & appointments and I like to have all my daily commitments on one page...I am however watching this space!</div>

<div>Mauricio:<br><br><< I am excited about FV. However, I have to ask, how is FV superior / more conducive to productivity than Superfocus? >><br><br>The main difference is that both SF and AF tend to result initially in the minor/easy tasks being processed first, while the "squeeze" is only put on the more difficult tasks gradually. In FV this is not the case.<br><br>An associated problem with SF/AF is that there is a tendency for the list to get packed with easy tasks which give an illusion of progress. What is actually happening thought is that the easy tasks on a page get dealt with quickly, while the more difficult tasks only get dealt with a few at a time. So typically a new page will have 30-40 per cent of its tasks dealt with on the first couple of passes, but in later passes the proportion of tasks will fall dramatically. This results in a large number of active pages. <br><br>In FV there is no pay-off for packing the list with easy tasks, so the length of the list is dramatically reduced. The processing of tasks is much more even throughout the list, with the result that the list tends to be concentrated on a few pages (my current list has 4 pages, but there are only 2 tasks each on the first and last pages).<br><br>Also unlike SF/AF, the FV list is dealt with as one list. The page divisions are not significant (and in electronic versions are not needed at all).</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Asim Jalis - 2012-02-8 17:21</div>
<div>I have the same experience. In AF4 the easy tasks get done quickly and then the non-trivial tasks clog up the pages. The easy tasks give an illusion of progress, so it is always fun to work on the easy tasks. The more challenging tasks remain unprocessed.<br><br>A random thought that just occurred to me is to leave some lines after a hard task that can be filled with easy tasks related to that hard task. Maybe leave 4 blank lines. This way when it's time to work on the hard task I have to come up with an easy task first. Once I complete four easy tasks then I can move the hard task to the end of the AF4 list, again leaving a few blank lines after it.</div>

<div>+JMJ+<br><br><<No, they don't relate to urgency as such. >><br><br>From looking at all the clues---the pictures, the latest blog entry, the blog entries on importance and urgency---I would guess that the dots are actually related to IMPORTANCE, not urgency.<br><br>The latest blog entry says that, with respect to difficult vs easy items, FV's "processing of tasks is much more even throughout the list." Initial sorting or tagging of items by importance fulfills this: no matter how easy or difficult an item is, if you can't "put up" with it not being done for too long, then you'd ought to do it.  <br><br>This tagging also fits well into Mark's latest definitions of importance and urgency: "If the answer to any of these questions ['How long can I put up with something?'] is 'indefinitely', 'never' or 'I don’t know yet', then you can remove the project from your list for now" (markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2012/1/30/how-do-we-tell-how-important-a-task-is.html ).  Conversely, if items are important enough, they ought to be worked on first, prioritized by urgency, and the initial way to do this (aside from listing them in a separate list) is tagging them, e.g. a dot.<br><br>Of course all of this is just speculation, and of course there are still some unanswered questions.  First of all, if all of these are correct, then how does Mark tag the "important" tasks? And second, how could the system be "designed to produce the right load for the time available, but it is also designed to ensure that this load consists of the right stuff. Not only that, but in the process goals will be clarified and worthwhile emerging new ideas exploited to the full" (<a href="../blog/Key Principles of the New System II Universal Capture.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2011/9/19/key-principles-of-the-new-system-ii-universal-capture.html</a> )?<br><br>Oh well, I guess we'd have to wait for the book :D</div>

<div>My speculation was that perhaps dotted tasks were "urgent starting tomorrow" (or in rare cases, today), and that these are processed more frequently (perhaps AF4 backlog style or something similar) than the rest of the list.  I think I'll give that a try for a while anyway and see what happens.</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Margaret1 - 2012-02-10 11:34</div>
<div>This looks like the other lists that Mark has posted.  He writes the tasks with no dot, puts a dot in front of the task he wants to work on, then when he's done as much of the task as he wants to, he draws a line from the dot through the task.  Drawing a vertical line through the dots of tasks that have been worked on makes it easier to see the unactoned items.  So I think this is the same, and there's no relation to the urgency or importance of the tasks.  <br><br>Hope you have a fantastic time in Australia, Mark.</div>

<div>Colley's Rule is fascinating! I was wondering what odds it truly yielded of obtaining a high value, but I found no entry at Wikipedia. So I tried my hand at it on paper, and it turned out to break down easily once I sketched it as a histogram.<br><br>BOTTOM LINE (so you don't have to skip to the end ;)<br><br>Compared to a single random pick, Colley's Rule doubles your chances of hitting the narrow top percentiles while sharply throttling your chances of hitting the corresponding bottom ones.<br><br>In the middle ranges, there is a nice payoff, e.g. if you want to land in the upper half, Colley's Rule gives you a 75% chance, vs. the 50% of a single random pick.<br><br>By quartiles, the breakdown from highest to lowest is: 44%, 31%, 19%, 6%.<br><br>Your chances of achieving "mediocrity" (middle two quartiles) are exactly 50%.<br><br>ANALYSIS<br><br>Consider N items of random rankings, and list them in a histogram from lowest-ranking to highest. Note that you will not encounter them in ranked order when executing Colley's Rule, but for analysis, the histogram of outcomes will be drawn in rank order. Draw the height of each histogram's bar to represent the number of outcomes obtaining that item. The leftmost item will have no bar (zero height), because Colley's Rule never obtains the very lowest item, since it always obtains something higher than your first pick. The second-lowest item will have a height of one, meaning that the only outcome obtaining this item is to pick the very lowest item first and then happen upon that second item next. The third-lowest has two outcomes: You might first pick the lowest item or the second-lowest item, followed by picking the third-lowest item. You can see that the very highest item has N-1 outcomes, by picking any of the other N-1 items first and then happening upon that very highest item next.<br><br>We can now find probabilities for any single item or group of items by adding up their bars and dividing by the grand total of all bars. The whole enchilada is a stair-step pattern from 1 up to N-1, whose bars sum to:<br><br>(N-1)*N / 2 = total number of all outcomes = sum of all bars<br><br>Similarly, the sum of the first m bars is:<br><br>(m-1)*m / 2 = sum of bars 1 through m<br><br>So, the probability of obtaining any of the first m items is:<br><br>m*(m-1) / (N*(N-1))<br><br>Now, just let N go really large, and express m as a fraction of N—say, u=m/N:<br><br>P(lower u) = u*u, where u is a ratio from 0.0 to 1.0 (e.g., u=1/3 refers to the bottom 1/3)<br><br>P(above u) = 1-u*u<br><br>NUMERIC RESULTS<br><br>2% chance of landing in the top 1% (above u=99%)<br>19% chance of top 10% (above u=90%)<br>44% chance of top quartile (above u=75%)<br>75% chance of top half (above u=50%)<br>19% chance of 2nd-lowest quartile (bottom half minus bottom quartile)<br>6% chance of bottom quartile (lower u=25%)<br>1% chance of bottom 10% (lower u=10%)<br>0.01% chance of worst 1% (lower u=1%)<br><br>GENERALLY ...<br> 2*e chance of landing in a small upper "e" percentile<br>e-squared (tiny) chance of landing in a small lower "e" percentile<br><br>QUARTILES (isn't this fun?)<br>44% top quartile<br>31% 3rd quartile<br>19% 2nd<br>6% bottom<br><br>MEDIOCRITY<br>Your chances of hitting the middle half (2nd and 3rd quartiles) are precisely 50%.<br><br>EXTENSION<br>Well, then ... suppose we made a third cascaded pick? I.e., after encountering that second item, keep looking for a third item to beat the second. Roughly, we would have a parabolically rising staircase instead of a linear one, and the probabilities would have a steeper cubic shape, pushing us further toward the top. If you are really looking for gold or strongly averse to junk, the payoff would be worth the small additional effort.</div>

<div>Bernie:<br><br>Erm! Ok!<br><br>I think I forgot to say in the article that you take as your benchmark the first house (or whatever) that meets your specifications. Therefore by definition you would already have a satisfactory result even if you bought the benchmark house and it was the worst example available.<br><br>Bear in mind that with the sort of items it is usually used with, houses, cars, restaurants, job offers and the like there is unlikely to be a huge number available that meet your specifications.

<div>Colley's Rule doesn't work if there are too few choices, especially if you don't know exactly how many there are (which is often the case).<br><br>Let's say you expect 5 acceptable job offers. There's a 1/5 chance that the best one arrives first -- and you reject it. You then reject offers 2-5 because they're inferior. If you know there will be 5, that's fine -- when #5 arrives you take it. If #5 never comes, though, you're stuck.<br><br>Ideally, the rule include something to prevent this. Maybe "after x offers, lower your standards to the 2nd best seen so far."<br><br>Then there's Paulo's Rule. You reject more than one, then take the best. There are some simulations, but I lost the page. Paulo's was better than Colley's, but the testers didn't agree on the "win" criteria, or on how many to reject.<br><br>I like Feynman's Dessert Method: Always take the chocolate. It may not be the best thing on the menu, but it's probably pretty good. Besides, it's only dessert.</div>

<div>Mark,<br><br><<I think I forgot to say in the article that you take as your benchmark the first house (or whatever) that meets your specifications. Therefore by definition you would already have a satisfactory result even if you bought the benchmark house and it was the worst example available.>><br><br>Sure, you did mention that, and I took it into account. Here is how my analysis applies to the house scenario:<br><br>Before shopping, you make your list of specifications. At the moment you finish the list, there are N houses that meet your specifications. You don't know where they are, and you don't have them on an itemized list, and you don't even know the value of N, but they exist right at that moment in your neighborhood (or whichever neighborhood(s) you listed in the specifications), and there are N of them, whether that is 5 or 500.<br><br>Now you go out shopping. The first house you discover that meets your specifications is the "benchmark" house. In my writeup, it is that "first pick" which leads to the histogram bars. Mathematically, you have just drawn from N lottery tickets. Physically, you have arrived at the first of N pre-existing acceptable houses.<br><br>You leave that house, per Colley's Rule, searching for a second house that is more desirable than the benchmark. At this moment, there are N-1 or fewer remaining houses that meet your specifications *and* are more desirable (to you) than the benchmark house. Again, you don't know what this number is, nor do you have a list of these houses, but they exist, and there is some definite number of them less than N. By continuing to shop until you find your first house more desirable than the benchmark, you are now drawing from a second lottery, in which certain tickets have been removed. The remaining tickets correspond to all the houses of the original N that you would find more desirable than the benchmark. Physically, you trudge through additional houses that were never represented by lottery tickets, but they don't need tickets, because you were never going to draw them.<br><br>The above leads to the staircase histogram, which results in all the rest of my figures.<br><br><br><<Bear in mind that with the sort of items it is usually used with, houses, cars, restaurants, job offers and the like there is unlikely to be a huge number available that meet your specifications. So adding another pick may simply result in your running out of choices.>><br><br>I did play around with small sample sizes, and actually the results are much the same. I just didn't write up the small samples, because the mid probabilities vary so much with N.<br><br>Let's try N=6:<br>P(top 1 of 6 houses)=33%<br>P(top 2 of 6 houses)=60%<br>P(top 3 of 6 houses)=80%<br>P(2nd worst of 6 houses)=6.7%<br>P(worst option)=0%<br>("worst" = least desirable of the houses that meet your specifications)<br><br>Not bad! Again, Colley's Rule doubles our chances of hitting the top, versus a random pick. Had you merely selected your first acceptable house, you'd have played Russian Roulette. Instead, just by discovering one more acceptable house, not even seeing two-thirds of the acceptable field, you have given yourself an 80% chance of landing in the top half of desirability and nearly a 2/3 chance of top third.<br><br>Again, I realize all six of these houses are acceptable, but the purpose of Colley's Rule is to make a quite nice choice with a minimum of comparison effort. I am measuring its success by looking at its odds of selecting our most desirable options. It remains quite effective at that for low N.</div>

<div>Cricket,<br><br><<Let's say you expect 5 acceptable job offers. There's a 1/5 chance that the best one arrives first -- and you reject it. You then reject offers 2-5 because they're inferior. If you know there will be 5, that's fine -- when #5 arrives you take it. If #5 never comes, though, you're stuck.>><br><br>A very good point, but it is not exactly a flaw in Colley's Rule. The problem is the time dependence, the fact that you have to reject the benchmark before looking at other options. That is not a problem in Mark's house scenario, though I guess in a competitive real estate market, your benchmark *might* get snapped up while you are looking for that second house. Hopefully you would get on with it and find that second house (or give up) quickly, so the benchmark would still be available. Perhaps even put a small deposit on it. I think we were able to reserve our house for 24 hours without putting down any money at all.<br><br>But if you must firmly cancel the benchmark before you continue, then the small numbers certainly cause trouble. Mark did mention job offers in passing, so yes, we need to watch for that before running with Colley.<br><br>But if we apply Colley's Rule to a to-do list, then certainly the benchmark is not going to disappear on us.</div>

<div>On perfectionism and Colley's Rule:<br><br>Those of you in computer science will recognize the similarity to sorting/ranking algorithms. And all of us on this board will notice the applicability to perfectionists' troubles with decision making.<br><br>In a classic ranking problem, we want to find the highest value among N items. The perfectionist (or 100% accurate computer program) needs to find the *best* answer to this, which requires N-1 pairwise comparisons (among the acceptable items alone; if you count the rejections of non-acceptable items, it is somewhat more, but they do not count against the N). For N=6 houses, the perfectionist must discover and visit every acceptable house, keeping a running "winner" in his mind, and always updating the winner upon reaching a better house. After examining the final house, the perfectionist buys the absolute best one.<br><br>I don't pretend to know Mark's mind on how this applies to a to-do list, and I'm not fond of guessing (though I'm willing to be entertained by others' guesses!), but here is one example of how Colley's Rule can help a perfectionist when facing a to-do list:<br><br>You have 73 items on a multipage to-do list, and you want to pick the perfectly very best, tip-toppest one to work on right now. Your specification is merely "an item on this list." You must make 72 comparisons. Start at the beginning, scan to the end, keeping a running winner.<br><br>But given Colley's Rule (and maybe a shot of whiskey), you can take the first item as your benchmark and just scan until you meet a better one. Statistically, you can expect to scan half the list, 36 items instead of 73, before finding a better one. If there is trouble starting at the "first item" because there is too much structure (non-randomness) at the end/beginning of the list, then turn to a random middle page to begin your search, wrapping around at the end.<br><br>This gets better, of course, if you have a real specification, such as "items that I pre-marked with a dot because they're urgent" or "items that feel ready to be done," etc. Then you will make even fewer comparisons, because it will take much less effort to reject the items that don't meet specification.<br><br>Not that we have any perfectionists around here, at all, but if I were one of them, I might be really excited about applying this rule ... right now ... as I choose a new local bank. Specification: no monthly service charge, conveniently located ATM's, no fee for OFX download, offers Health Savings Account ... I have a pile of brochures. Maybe I don't need to read *all* of them!!</div>

<div>The claim I find most intriguing about Mark's "Final Version" is that he is able to keep the list stable to about four pages. The harder items don't clutter up and stretch out the list. He also no longer uses closed lists. So it's a single running list. And the completed tasks are evenly spread out, not concentrated at the beginning or at the end.<br><br>I am just wildly speculating here, but one way to do this could be to have a rule where you do one task per page. If there are no tasks on the page that can be worked on you dismiss a task from the page. So you either complete a task or you dismiss a task from each page. And you keep cycling through the pages.</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Asim Jalis - 2012-02-11 20:15</div>
<div>I was thinking about how Mark is able to keep the list evenly processed and also keep a single list. Maybe it's this: Pick the first task and complete it. Then pick a second task and complete it. Starting with the third task, each task must be between the last two tasks that were completed. Gradually this band will narrow. When there are no more tasks that look appealing, dismiss one of the tasks and start again.</div>

<div>I'm guessing the dots work like Mark used them in AF1:  as you are scanning the list, put a dot next to the item that stands out.<br><br>In AF1, you'd start working on this item immediately, for as long as you want.   When you decide to stop, you'd re-enter the item at the end of the list, and then cross off the dotted item.<br><br>For FV, I'm guessing the dot still means "it stands out", but then I have some other ideas of how the item gets processed.<br><br>First idea:  Mark scans the whole list, putting a dot next to any item that stands out.  BUT, no action is taken immediately - the scanning just continues.   After a pass through the list, you've got a few items with dots, and having circled through everything, you now come back to the first item.  It becomes your Colley's Rule baseline.  Skip it, and move on to the other dotted items.  When you come to a dotted item that stands out MORE than the baseline, take action, working as long as you want.  When done, cross off the item, re-entering at the end if recurring or unfinished.   Move forward to the next dotted item, which is now your new baseline.  Action the next dotted item that stands out MORE than the baseline.  ....   If you go through all the dotted items and nothing stands out more than the baseline, that would indicate you don't have enough dotted items, so cycle through your whole list again and create a new set of dotted items.    Or something along these lines.<br><br>(2) (TOTALLY DIFFERENT GUESS)   Read through the items in the list in order.  When an item stands out, put a dot next to it, and then work on that item as long as you want.  When you decide to stop working:  (a) If it's a recurring item, cross off and re-enter.  (b) If it's FINISHED, then cross it off.  (c) If the task is UNFINISHED, then leave it there, dotted.   Then continue cycling through the list.  After awhile, you'll have dots on all the tasks you've started but didn't finish.   This tells you how many plates you are trying to keep spinning before they all come crashing down.   And it also helps unfinished work to stand out more since they already have dots.  It also slows down the growth of the list since there's less re-entry.<br><br>(3) Some combination of (1) and (2)?</div>

<div>Evidence for my guesses:<br><br>I think the evidence is strongest for guess #2.   I don't see any non-recurring tasks that are rewritten.   The rewritten tasks are either typical recurring tasks (FTSE, Blog GED, Email) or what appear to be project tasks (Fund Raising Action, which I take to mean "scan the fund raising project and take an appropriate next action").<br><br>The only exception I noticed was "Sunset Boulevard", in quotes, which I would guess is the 1950 film.   This one is re-entered once or twice, but it doesn't makes sense as a recurring task.  <br><br>So, I would guess this means that "Sunset Boulevard" is actually a television show that I couldn't find on Google, so it's actually a recurring task.<br><br>Or, it was a task that Mark started (i.e., watched a bit of the film).   But subsequently, it just didn't stand out anymore at all, and at some point Mark decided to delete it.   But sometime after that, he changed his mind and entered it anew.<br><br>(For those who don't know, Mark does really apply the "little and often" technique to his film-watching!)<br><br><br>I think the main evidence against my #1 guess is that Mark's solutions are generally much simpler and more elegant than that.   Guess #2 has more of the feel of something Mark may have actually invented (or at least tried) - at least in my estimation.  :-)<br><br>In any case, I find those photos excruciatingly difficult to read, so all my guesses may be hogwash.  :-)</div>

<div>@Seraphim: Oh, no. I think I've got it.<br><br>Observe the dot pattern of the unactioned items on the last page:<br> d..dddd.... (stop here. I guess all the following are subsequently added items. d stands for a dot, and the dot stands for...well... no dot)<br><br>And look closely at the three following striked items. Only the two first seem to have gotten a dot. The third one seems to have a single stroke, without a dot. Which would give :<br><br>d..dddd....dd.<br><br>I am certainly seeing what I want to see here. But if I'm guessing right, the dotting process is this one. It's done for each page:<br>1. Put one left-hand finger on the first unactioned item and one right-hand finger on the last unactioned item of the page.<br>2. Compare these two items. Determine the one that stands out most (or whatever. I'm no good when it comes to details)<br>3. With your teeth, pick up your pen and manage to draw a dot in front of the chosen item.<br>4. Move your left finger down one unactioned item and your right finger up one unactioned item.<br>5. If your fingers did not cross each other, go to 2. Else, you're done with the page.<br><br>I don't remember the exact wording, but Mark said something like  the page size is of no importance to the speed at which items get processed. You may think that it indicates that the list is processed as a whole, not page per page. Wrong. The page size has no importance. With this technique, 50% of a page will be done at every pass. Whatever the page size, you will always process half of the items on it, even if they are hard. If you make pages smaller, you will only go from page to page faster.<br><br>And about Colley's rule... It says:<br><br>1. pick the first one that meets your specification as a benchmark<br>2. take the next one that's better than the benchmark<br><br>1. is unapplicable with Mark's philosophy. If it's on your list, it meets your specification. It is important. It needs doing. ("If it's not important, why is it on your list in the first place?") Therefore, as any of the two is a suitable benchmark, both are valid to be the underdog with regards to the other. It boils down to : Get two. Choose. Period.</div>

<div>Bernie, Mark, and anyone else interested in Colley's Rule:<br><br>Finding the "best decision" is a well-known math problem, sometimes known as the Secretary Problem. Although Colley uses the very first opportunity as a benchmark, the best solution is actually to evaluate and reject the first 37% possibilities, and then take the next possibility that is better than all of the preceding 37%. <br><br>If the number of possibilities is small (houses, checking accounts) then Colley might provide similar results, but it's nice to know that you can confidently scale up to any sort of decision.<br><br>If you're wondering where 37% came from, it's actually 1/e.

<div>FSE:<br><br>Fascinating. I think the alternative name "Sultan's Dowry Problem" sounds much more interesting than "The Secretary Problem"!<br><br>However I get the impression that it's directed at a different problem from Colley's rule in that Colley's rule is a method of making a relatively quick decision with a good chance of a high quality result. The aim is basically to save time and effort.<br><br>The Sultan's Dowry method on the other hand is not concerned in the least with saving time or effort but with how you get the highest chance of getting the best result when there is no going back on the individual decisions.</div>

<div>The Sultan's dowry is rather artificial.  The dating game is a more natural fit: To find the perfect mate, you might date people serially until you pick whom you hope is the best - but no going back to previous rejects.  So you reject the first 37% and then pick whomever is better than all those.  High probability of finding the perfect mate, but also a 37% chance of missing and getting nobody!  <br><br>But not necessary in task-picking where you will ultimately pick many and none are truly urgent.<br><br>Laurent: "3.

<div>Laurent,<br><br>"1" does apply because items can be out of context or not suitable for the time available.  If I have 30 minutes between classes, my system needs to be able to select a suitable task.  Previous systems couldn't always do this; for instance, with AF1 if the page I'm on does not have a suitable task for the time available, I'd either have to dismiss a page unnecessarily or apply the escape rule.<br><br>Using Colley's rule, I can choose as my "benchmark" the "next item that could be done now" (given my location, time available, etc.), and then pick the next item that would be better to do npw.</div>

<div>Mark:<br><br>Actually, I'm pretty sure Colley's rule was also intended for decisions that cannot be revisited. <br><br>Otherwise, the decision procedure is trivial. If you look at half of the possibilities and choose the most favorable from them, then you will have a 50% chance of making the optimal choice (but take only half as long as looking through all the possibilities). Of course, you can replace "half" with "three-quarters", "a third", etc. depending on how much you value your time against your need for perfection. There is no right answer, because it's a matter of personal preference.</div>

<div>FSE,<br><br><<Finding the "best decision" is a well-known math problem, sometimes known as the Secretary Problem. Although Colley uses the very first opportunity as a benchmark, the best solution is actually to evaluate and reject the first 37% possibilities, and then take the next possibility that is better than all of the preceding 37% ... <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_problem>>" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_problem>></a><br><br>Thanks for that article! It also says that your chances of finding the *very best* candidate this way are 37%, which sounds quite impressive. Imagine your chances of hitting the top two or top three ...<br><br>As Mark summarized nicely (vs. Colley's Rule),<br><<The Sultan's Dowry [a.k.a. Secretary] method on the other hand is not concerned in the least with saving time or effort but with how you get the highest chance of getting the best result when there is no going back on the individual decisions.>><br><br>This made me wonder how much Colley's Rule really trades off, quantitatively, in pursuit of a quick answer, and so I discovered that Colley's gives you that same 37% chance of landing above the 80th percentile (of desirability).<br><br>I think this makes a very strong statement for Colley's: by relaxing the benchmarking process from 37% of the entire field to just ... (wait for it) ... one item (!!), the effect is to spread our luckiest 37% outcome over the top 80th percentile, versus the single best item. Definitely a tradeoff, but not bad for a quick pick, eh?<br><br>Here is the math (Colley's):<br>P(above 80th percentile) = 1 - 0.8*0.8 = 0.36<br>... so 37% cuts off at the 79-point-something percentile.<br><br><br>Cricket,<br><br>This Secretary/Sultan's problem addresses your point about job interviews that cannot be revisited once rejected. Unfortunately, their "37% chance of best candidate" relies on large-number analysis, but ...<br><br>Applying their 1/e rule to your scenario of 5 interviews, you would take and reject the first two interviews (2 being 37% of 5), then look for something better among the final three. I don't know, I think I'd prefer Colley's again. Throwing away two of five interviews makes me nervous! Throwing away even one of five? Maybe.</div>

<div>FSE:<br><br><< I should also point out that Colley's rule, like the 37% rule, was also intended for decisions that could not be revisited. >><br><br>I'd be interested to know your authority for that statement. Whether or not that is true, Colley's rule works best if you can revisit the decisions - which will be the case in most real-life situations. If no better choice than the benchmark appears by the time you have exhausted all the possibilities then you take the benchmark. The larger the number of candidates the less likely this is to be necessary.<br><br>I have used Colley's rule in many situations and it has proved itself in use many times. I cannot imagine how I could use The Secretary method in real life. Just look at the difference in procedure:<br><br>In The Secretary you don't even get your benchmark until you have looked at over a third of the candidates. And to do that you have to know how many candidates there are - which will not be the case in many real life situations. <br><br>In Colley's rule you don't need to know how many candidates there are, and there is a high probability you will arrive at a solution very quickly - which is the entire purpose of the rule.</div>

<div>Mark,<br><br>I haven't spoken to Colley (aka Collee) himself, so my only sources are secondhand discussions. Probably the most authoritative one appears in the Financial Times website:<br><br>"The rule assumes you cannot go back to any of the choices you reject" (<a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/3a6fbc42-4fd2-11d9-86b3-00000e2511c8.html#axzz1mTAxdrzh)" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/3a6fbc42-4fd2-11d9-86b3-00000e2511c8.html#axzz1mTAxdrzh)</a><br><br>I think the reason that you need this constraint is that otherwise the solution is underdetermined. In other words: suppose you could look over as many choices as you wanted, and return to any of them at any time. How many should you look at? Well... that depends. If you want a 50% chance of finding the best choice, then you should look at 50% of the total. If you only have time to look at ten out of N possibilities, then you will only have a 10/n chance of finding the best choice. <br><br>When you are not allowed to revisit choices, every option you consider has a large cost - you must discard the previous option - for an uncertain reward. That's why knowing when to stop requires guidance from Colley (or the Sultan). It's a bit like poker, you have play the odds.<br><br>But with revisitation permitted, it's more like research than poker. The only cost is your time and the only reward is new information. Those are predictable quantities, and the relationship between them is a simple one-to-one tradeoff. There is never a need to commit to an all-or-nothing gamble. Instead, the decision is straightforward: how much do you value your time against your need for perfection. That doesn't require a mathematical strategy, it just requires you to balance your personal values. In this setting, Colley is no better than flipping a coin every so often and ending your search when it lands heads.</div>

I describe the analysis in detail on page 1 of these replies.

There are a few followups shortly after that shed some more light with a more concrete explanation. Please have a look and let me know if you find errors.

I will gladly join you on a new forum thread to iron it out.<br><br>Maybe you are looking at the expression 1-x*x and being reminded of the math that arises from a straightforward lottery?

Hopefully a look at the analysis and other comments on page 1 will clear that up. Since Colley's is very effective for small N, you can also confirm this through experiment: write numbers on index cards, shuffle them into a stack, benchmark the top number, and proceed down the stack until you beat it. Make a histogram of your results, and they should beat the pants off of the occasional coin flip or a straight lottery, or even a best of two lotteries ... but I don't recommend 100,000 trials!</div>

<div>Bernie and Mark,<br><br>Ok, I just ran some simulations in MATLAB for this problem.

I can post a detailed table of results if you want, but here is the executive summary: <br><br>1) When there is a small number of possibilities (i.e. between 5 and 20), "The Rule of Three" provides much better results on average than Colley's Rule and takes slightly less time on average. <br><br>2) When there is a large number of possibilities (i.e. between 20 and 10,000), "The Rule of Three" provides slightly better results than Colley's rule, and takes much less time.  <br><br>I have to say that the results somewhat surprised me, but there they are.

<div>I'm no mathematician but surely it's easy to establish the exact odds between Colley's rule and the Rule of Three without having to run 100,000 trials or indeed any at all. <br><br>There are only six possible situations in the Colley v. R3 stand-off:<br><br>Each of the first three numbers must be either H=Highest; M=Middle; or L=Lowest<br><br>The possible combinations are:<br><br>L M H = R3 wins<br>M L H = Draw<br>M H L = Draw<br>L H M = Draw<br>H M L = Colley wins<br>H L M = Colley wins<br><br>Therefore:<br><br>1) The chances of both methods producing the same result are 50%.<br><br>2) Colley is twice as likely as R3 to produce a better result.<br><br>However there is a complicating factor which is what happens if the first number is the maximum. In this case some of Colley's wins will become draws. The likelihood of this happening is greater the lower the total number of numbers. With very a low number it would impact severely on Colley's chances of producing a better result than R3 (though only because both would produce the best available result).<br><br>My experimental results with the random generator seem to be in conformity with this.<br><br>So my conclusions are:<br><br>1) If you know there are only a small number of candidates then it doesn't matter much what method you use since you can probably afford the time to look at all of them anyway.<br><br>2) If you know there are a more than a small number of candidates, use Colley's rule.<br><br>3) If you don't know how many candidates there are, use Colley's rule.<br><br>4) If you can't go back or it would be inconvenient, use Colley's rule.<br><br>5) Precision and accuracy aren't the same thing.</div>

<div>I have looked closely at the simulations, and discovered that we are both right. For any given sequence, Colley is twice as likely to produce a higher score than Rule of Three. However, in the long run the average score produced by Rule of Three is higher. <br><br>This seems counterintuitive, but there is a reason for it: when Colley wins, it tends to win by a much smaller margin than when Rule of Three wins. That means Rule of Three can keep a high average score even with a lower win rate.<br><br>I think it's pretty indisputable that Rule of Three is faster than Colley. So I immediately wondered whether I could optimize the rule by trading some of its speed for a better win rate, without affecting its simplicity or hurting the average score. <br><br>Without further ado, I present to you ... the Rule of Four!<br><br>Just like it sounds, in this rule you look at the first four choices and choose the best one. How does it perform?<br><br>1) For n > 10, the Rule of Four will provide higher average scores, has a higher win rate, and is faster than Colley. <br><br>2) For n < 10, the Rule of Four will provide much higher average scores and a much higher win rate. However, at this range Colley's is slightly faster, though it is still slower than Rule of Three.<br><br>I also looked at a new parameter: how often the results are in the top or bottom quintile.<br><br>For Colley's, you can expect to be in the top quintile 50-60% of the time, depending on n. For the Rule of Four, you can expect to be in the top quintile 60-80% of the time, depending on n.<br><br>Finally, Colley's ends up in the bottom quintile 2-3% of the time. The Rule of Four ends up there <0.2% of the time. <br><br>Perhaps I should apply for a research grant in order to study the Rule of Five ...</div>

<div>Mark, could your results be due to the sample size? I just reduced the number of trials down to 7 and ran the results a few times. There was quite a bit of variability, and R3 did not always have the highest score. Here's an example:<br><br>Mean score from 7 trials, choosing from 1-100<br><br>Run #1: Colley = 61.0, R3 = 70.9<br>Run #2: Colley = 95.1, R3 = 85.6<br>Run #3: Colley = 79.0, R3 = 88.6<br>Run #4: Colley = 75.9, R3 = 82.9<br>Run #5: Colley = 76.0, R3 = 78.7<br><br>But when I dialed back up to 100,000 trials, the pattern was clear:<br><br>Mean score from 100,000 trials, choosing from 1-100<br><br>Run #1: Colley = 75.3, R3 = 75.8<br>Run #2: Colley = 75.3, R3 = 75.7<br>Run #3: Colley = 75.2, R3 = 75.6<br>Run #4: Colley = 75.3, R3 = 75.8<br>Run #5: Colley = 75.2, R3 = 75.8</div>

<div>Mark & FSE, wow!

Buying a house by Rule of Three, I have to find three houses that meet my spec, never two, always three. Colley's will often terminate at the second qualified house, no? I don't think it's obvious which is faster; you'd have to look at various cases of how the houses were sequenced and average over them.

<div>Mark & FSE, now you have done it: I went to bed, but instead of counting sheep, I've been counting histograms!<br><br>The first thing I noticed is that my original analysis of Colley's Rule was actually an analysis of "Rule of Two." That's right, take FSE's Rule of Three, cut it down to a Rule of Two, and do the math. You will get exactly what I got for Colley's. Which means, my Colley's is not Colley's!<br><br>I think that when I glossed over the items/houses encountered between the benchmark and the final selection, I ended up ignoring combinatorics that affect the result. That is, my linear staircase histogram underestimates the number of ways to reach higher-valued outcomes, because it does not account for the various combinations of the losing houses that crop up after the benchmark. At the time, I thought they didn't matter, but now I think they are going to act as a weighting factor that pushes our probability curve much further toward the higher values. It will make Colley's much more effective than I initially reported.<br><br>For example, for N=3, we have the following six possible sequences:<br>123 --> 2 (Colley's result)<br>132 --> 3<br>213 --> 3<br>231 --> 3<br>312 --> 3<br>321 --> 3<br>And so, P(3) is 5/6, not the 2/3 predicted by my original analysis.<br><br>For N=4,<br>2 ways to get 2:<br>    1234, 1243 --> 2<br>5 ways to get 3:<br>    1324, 1342, 2134, 2314, 2341 --> 3<br>17 ways to get 4:<br>    1423, 1432, 2143, 2413, 2431, 3124, 3142, 3214, 3241, 3412, 3421, 4123, 4132, 4213, 4231, 4312, 4321 --> 4<br>(Double-check: Total "ways" = 2+5+17=24, which is 4-factorial, representing the entire outcome space.)<br><br>So the correct P(4) is 17/24, whereas my staircase histogram calls it 3/6.<br>Correct P(3) is 5/24, vs. my 2/6; correct P(2) is 2/24 vs. my 1/6.<br>Yeah, I really underestimated Colley! Imagine how much more enamored I'll be once I get it right!!<br><br>So, I will start over, no shortcuts, using the entire N-factorial outcome space. I can't say how it will compare to Rule of Three, but it sure looks like Colley's combinatorics are going to pile up very steeply. Since you two are all over the number crunching already, I'll stick to the equations. But first I'll go to sleep. Really.</div>

<div>It is annoying jumping to page 3 of a discussion.  It might help to clarify what I think you have in mind as well:<br><br>I would not look at the first item, and then seek a more suitable candidate.  I would search for the first "good enough" item, and then seek a more suitable candidate.  The corresponding Rule of 3 would be rather more difficult: "Find 3 suitable candidates and choose the best".  Definitely not just a pick 3 task any more.</div>

<div>It occurs to me that my implementation of Colley's might not be the same as what you have in mind. In the canonical form, you choose the first item better than the benchmark, or the last item in the list (if the benchmark is the highest). In the variant used here, it appears that if nothing is found to be better than the benchmark, then the benchmark itself is used. This does improve the performance of Colley's. <br><br>I'm short on time today (ironically, I've procrastinated my real work!), but once I have time I will repeat the simulated comparisons of this Colley variant to the Rules of 3 and 4.</div>

<div>[Comment written by Miracle - but he didn't succeed in getting the website to accept it}<br><br>I have to agree with Alan B, Colley will not result in mental rebellion (at least in me) compared to the Rule Of Three, or Four or N.  (I’m going to call it/them, the Rule Of N – or RON for short).  You see, I work as a program manager, managing anywhere between 15 and 20 IT projects, totaling between $15 and $20 Mil at any given time.  I’m currently also pursuing my Master’s degree in Information Systems (IS), and an Acquisition course provided by my employer.  I also have a family that relies on me as a father and husband, I write Science Fiction and Fantasy, and finally – I have ADD.  In short, I have a ton to juggle, and I can’t rely on my brain alone to juggle it for me.  I have used several systems, including Steven Covey’s 7 Habits, GTD, and virtually every system Mark has offered.  I have used the Rules of Three and Four, as well as Colley’s for at least a month each.  <br><br> <br><br>Now I’m no mathematician, but I do know systems.  I define an IS as “people using technology, or a tool, to orchestrate and manage a business process.”  IMHO – AF, SF, DIT, DWM, FV and their ilk all fit this definition of an IS on a personal level.  Now given that people drive IS, not machines, I will not rely on mathematical proofs and statistical analyses to choose between Colley and RON.  My criteria have to do more with how a person would use each rule for the purpose of selecting the next task.  I have several such criteria, but many do not form a basis for comparison.  <br><br> <br><br>For example, using the AF method of processing and doing what “feels ready” does not work for me.  Maybe it’s my ADD, or maybe I’m just human, but using the “feels ready” method for a period of several months resulted in my doing tons of little things and ignoring the big things.  My list became an aid to, and a written testament of my procrastination.  I need a method that foils my procrastination, rather than one that allows it to continue unfettered.  Therefore, my method of processing must not base itself on what I ‘feel’ like doing more, but rather on what I ‘value’ more.  Both Colley and RON do this and so this criterion of value based judgments does not form a real basis of comparison.<br><br> <br><br>However, I do have two criteria that form a decent basis for comparison:  strain on “mental RAM,” and the speed of list traversal.<br><br> <br><br>Studies show that the average person can consciously store an average of up to 7 pieces of information in their working memory (“mental RAM”) at one time.  All scientific notions aside – what I need in terms of strain on mental RAM boils down to this:  The less mental work needed to accomplish the process of selecting the next task, the better.  RON states “look only at the first N possibilities, choose the best one.”  So my mental processor must accomplish the following:<br><br>1) Look at the first task – determine if it is a “possibility” (ie: “Can I do this now?”)<br><br>2) Continue iteratively checking until I find the first possible task<br><br>3) Continue iteratively checking from there until I find the second possible task<br><br>4) …And then the third, and then the fourth, or the Nth – These N possible tasks may at this point, be found on multiple separate pages<br><br>5) Since all are possibilities, I must now hold all N tasks in my mind, and perform a value based evaluation to determine the best one<br><br> <br><br>For example, considering a Rule Of Four; I would have to evaluate several tasks for the possibility of doing them now – enough tasks to identify 4 possibilities.  I must then hold these four in my working memory (that can generally hold a max of 7) and use the remaining 3 “slots” of memory to perform value based judgments between them.  I know it’s a simple matter to calculate how many comparisons that would be, but like I said, I’m not a math guy so I don’t care enough to do it.  Anyway, after all that work, I would discard 75% of the possibilities that I expended effort finding, just to select one task to work.  <br><br> <br><br>Colley on the other hand would break out like this:<br><br>1) Look at the first task – determine if it is a “possibility” (ie: “Can I do this now?”)<br><br>2) Continue iteratively checking until I find the first possible task, and name it the benchmark – it will be discarded later<br><br>3) Continue iteratively checking from there until I find the second possible task<br><br>4) Holding the benchmark, and the next possibility in my working memory, use the remaining 5 “slots” to decide which has greater value<br><br>5) Either stop here, or discard the possible task and repeat steps 3 and 4<br><br> <br><br>RON requires me to do enough work to identify N possible tasks every single time, guaranteeing that 66% (for Rule Of Three) or more (for Rule Of Four or more) of that work will be discarded every single time I select a task.  Additionally, it requires that I compare N tasks together at the same time, or carry a (potentially changing) running favorite through a search for the remaining possibilities.<br><br> <br><br>Colley guarantees that I will discard only those tasks necessary to identify the next best thing.  Additionally, it requires that I carry only one (unchanging) benchmark task in my working memory through each comparison, and that I compare only 2 tasks at a single time.  Colley 1, RON 0.<br><br> <br><br>Now when I mention list traversal speed, I refer to the amount of the list read (whether acted upon or not).  I care about list traversal speed because tons of work flies unevaluated onto my list.  It comes from many directions, and I don’t have the time to evaluate everything upon entry (hence GTD didn’t work out too well for me).  If my list traversal speed < new unevaluated work arrival, then I end up “chasing the end of the list.”  My focus centers on certain parts of my list, and I don’t get much of an occasion to visit the other parts of my list.  Therefore I begin to lose touch with the full scope of my work, and without that context, I have more trouble saying “no” to tasks I just don’t have the bandwidth to handle at the time, and my list just fills and fills.  I spend more time adding to my list than working it off.<br><br> <br><br>With RON, I must engage in the above mental process (which takes time) to discard at least 66% of that effort upon choosing a task.  Upon finishing that task, I cross it off, and then I must begin the next task selection process.  This requires that I either recall what possibility #N was from the previous task selection process (that I likely discarded and forgot about as I worked on the task I selected) so that I can begin to identify the next N tasks to compare, or I can simply begin at the next possibility from the last action’d task.  However, doing so would carry the likelihood that the next possibility from the last action’d task was a possibility from the previous selection process, meaning that I not only considered possibilities that I discarded in the previous selection, but also that I may re-consider them in the next selection process.  <br><br> <br><br>For example:  I consider possible tasks A, B, C, and D.  I choose to do task B.  I then cross B off.  I could then try to remember which task was task D, so I can begin locating tasks E, F, G, and H.  I could also just begin identifying possibilities from B onward, identifying tasks C, D, E, and F for comparison.  In the first case I have to keep track of what D is or remember it somehow.  In the second case I would be re-evaluating tasks C and D.  Either way slows down my list traversal speed.<br><br> <br><br>Colley has no such additional processing necessary, nor does it risk re-evaluating a given task in two selections in a row.  Also, there’s a chance that the benchmark chosen may have a very high value, and so I will have to traverse a larger portion of my list just to find the next better task.  So Colley has less processing to hamper progress, and can occasionally result in a higher degree of traversal in a single given selection.  Therefore, using Colley results in faster list traversal overall.  Colley 2, RON 0.<br><br> <br><br>In my personal experience, RON results in more mental strain than payoff, and slow list traversal.  My experience using Colley indicates that it results in less mental strain for a decent payoff, and quick list traversal.  My vote:  Colley’s all the way.<br><br> <br><br>Mark, I am a big fan of you and your work.  Of all the task management systems I’ve tried, none have handled my task variety, task load, and scatter-shot focus as elegantly as your systems.  And of your systems, what works best for me is DWM2 (on a 4-day “Letter” cycle, and 15 day “Number” cycle rather than the traditional 7 and 30) processed via Colley’s Rule.  Of course DWM2 is really DWM1 in disguise, which of course is really DIT in disguise…  The curse of ADD involves never having enough focus to see anything (not even trivial things) through to completion – thereby dooming the poor sufferer to a life of always trying, and always failing.  Using your systems as my tools I have managed all of my responsibilities well for years, succeeding in things trivial and grand, without resorting to the use of prescription medication at all.  This feels to me like a monumental triumph, the lifting of a heavy karmic curse – like shaking the fruit loose from the tree of possibilities, or finally surfacing from the deep dark depths of the despair of failure, for a breath of fresh air.  Your work means a lot to me personally, and I shall wait on the edge of my seat to snatch your next book hot off the press.<br><br> <br><br>-Miracle</div>

<div>Thanks, Miracle. It really uplifts me to hear how my systems have helped you.<br><br>The Final Version as I have it at the moment will, I think, fit all the requirements you mention in your post. It's certainly doing a lot for *me* at the moment. As I've mentioned before I am not using Colley's rule in a conventional way. <br><br>I've used the RON with N as 2, 3, 6 and 10 in the past, and you're right in that it's nothing like as powerful as Colley. It's not just a matter of finding a good choice of task in the abstract, but also of psychological readiness. And the FV majors on that.</div>

<div>Colley's Rule math! Version two.<br>I'm really convinced I've got it now. My original "cascaded lottery" concept was right on target, but I went astray when I drew its histogram as a staircase. Now, fixed.<br><br>The results are astounding! Colley's performs quite respectably versus the tedious Secretary's Rule and very similarly to the lightweight but un-Forsterish Rule of Three. I'll start off with an example, because it makes a very clear pattern.<br><br>N=5:<br>P(1) = 0<br>P(2) = 1/5 * ( 1/4 )  =  1/20<br>P(3) = 1/5 * ( 1/4 + 1/3 )  =  7/60<br>P(4) = 1/5 * ( 1/4 + 1/3 + 1/2 )  =  13/60<br>P(5) = 1/5 * ( 1/4 + 1/3 + 1/2 + 2 )  =  37/60<br>(add 'em up: 60/60)<br><br>For arbitrary N:<br>P(n) = 1/N * ( 1/(N-1) + 1/(N-2) + 1/(N-3) + ... + 1/(N-n) )<br>with special cases P(1) = 0 and P(N) = P(N-1) + 2/N<br><br>Plugging in N=3 and N=4, I get the same results I posted earlier when I wrote those cases out in full and counted them up by brute force. There was not a single equation to go wrong that time, so I'm taking it as confirmation of my new formula.<br><br>To generalize beyond specific values of N, I made a spreadsheet of N=100:<br>The luckiest 10% of cases land above the 98th percentile of desirable items.<br>The luckiest 37% land above the 88th percentile (compare to Secretary's Rule, in which they get their top applicant).<br>The luckiest 50% land above the 81st percentile.<br>The unluckiest 15% land at or below the 50th percentile.<br>The unluckiest 10% land at or below the 42nd percentile.<br>The unluckiest 5% land at or below the 30th percentile.<br>(The point of N=100 is *not* that N needs to be large. I just wanted a fine-grain result that does not depend on a specific N. These figures give the right general idea for small N too.)<br><br>What the variables mean:<br>N = # of items (e.g. houses) that meet your specification. Call them "qualified items."<br>P(n) = probability of the n-ranked item (out of all N) being selected by Colley's Rule,<br>n=1 refers to your least desirable of the N qualified items,<br>n=N refers to your most desirable of the N qualified items.<br>To use Colley's in real life and obtain these results, you do not need to know the value of N or whether it is large or small.<br><br>The logic behind this formula:<br>We are drawing the benchmark (we'll call its rank "b") from a 1-of-N lottery, followed by drawing the winner from a 1-of-(N-b) lottery in which items not beating the benchmark have been removed. The first lottery simulates wandering at random until we encounter the first qualified item, and the second simulates the fact that whenever we first beat the benchmark, any of the higher-ranked items are equally likely to do it. There is a special case when we draw the very best item first and are unable to beat it. The stuff I said earlier about "full N-factorial combinatorics" etc. was technically right but overly complex and not ultimately helpful.<br><br>Mathematically, the winning approach was this:<br>P(n selected, given benchmark b) = 1/(N-b), for b<n. It is zero for n<b or n=b<N, and it is 1 for n=b=N. Then we obtain P(n) by summing over all values of b for the given n.<br><br>Comparison to Rule of Three (R3):<br>R3 luckiest 6% land above 98th percentile.<br>R3 luckiest 32% land above 88th percentile.<br>R3 luckiest 50% land above 79th percentile.<br>R3 unluckiest 12.5% land at or below 50th percentile.<br>R3 unluckiest 5% land at or below 37th percentile.<br>(I computed using P(failing to exceed p percentile) = p*p*p)<br><br>--> Rule of Three performs quite similarly to Colley's Rule. Colley's is better at picking top choices, while R3 is better at avoiding bottom ones. Earlier comments about R3's usefulness for human to-do lists and psychological readiness are well taken and of course not reflected in these numbers.</div>

<div>In honor of dead horses everywhere, I have discovered the following:<br><br>Colley's Rule Outcome Statistics<br><br>Example for N=100:<br>	75.745 average value<br>	21.95 standard deviation<br>	6.18 average # qualified items examined<br>	(though 2/3 of the time, you will examine no more than 3 items)<br><br>Keep in mind, this is not a normal distribution (bell curve), so most conventional wisdom from stats class does not apply. The average is not the most likely result, as the most likely is N itself, and you cannot use the std. dev. to talk about three-sigma-this and four-sigma-that. These are computed means, nothing more.<br><br>Despite the 6-ish avg. # of items examined: half the time, you will examine only 2 items, and two-thirds of the time, you will examine no more than 3 items (compare to Rule of Three/Four/N). You reach the sixth item only 1/5 of the time. And strangely, that is all true regardless of N, thanks to the peculiar Harmonic Series (below).<br><br>These item counts (and the value N) do not include the unqualified items that you would reject in a real-life trial (house shopping) for failing to meet your minimum specification. But if you are comparing to other methods (Rule of Three, etc.), those same unqualified items would have to be passed over as well.<br><br>For general N:<br><br>Average value<br>	roughly 3/4 of N (think of the middle value that beats the middle value)<br>	actually 3N/4 + 3/4 - 1/(2N)<br><br>Standard deviation<br>	roughly N * (7N/6 - 1) / 24 ... for large N ... as if that helps ...<br>	actually 7N*N/144 - N/24 - 49/144 + 7/(12N) + 1/(4N*N)<br><br>Average # qualified items examined<br>	actually 2 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + ... + 1/(N-1), for N>2<br>	roughly, umm, well ... <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_number" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_number</a><br>	intuitively, the chances of not beating benchmark in k items are 1/k, in which the highest of those k is discovered first (note how this does not depend at all on N).<br><br>Fine Print<br>- This is all for a pool of N "qualified" items, meaning that they meet your specification: they are all at least barely acceptable. Unqualified items have been ignored completely.<br>- An item's "value" is its rank, 1 to N, according to your preference scale. In practice, you do not know an item's numerical rank when you encounter it, but the rank exists for purposes of analysis, so long as you are able to identify your favorite of any two items.<br>- To estimate how many unqualified items would clutter up the process, you would have to posit a density of qualified items among the entire pool. For our task lists, there is no generally meaningful way of doing that, but the same items would have to be passed over using any other algorithm vs. Colley's.</div>

<div>Sheer excitement! I've liberated Colley's Rule from "N":<br><br>P( top x ) = x - x*ln(x)<br>where x is from 0.0 to 1.0, indicating a percentile range.<br><br>Now, anyone can explore the Colley's landscape in a few seconds with only a calculator! (I can hear you all cheering ... or is that the dishwasher?)<br><br>For example,<br>P( top 12% ) = 0.12 - 0.12*ln(0.12) = 37% chance,<br>meaning that we have a 37% chance of landing in the top 12 percentiles.<br>Results are nearly identical to my N=100 figures posted earlier.<br><br>At the lower end of the scale,<br>P( bottom x ) = x + (1-x)*ln(1-x)<br><br>For a middle range, it is simplest to measure from the top:<br>P( top x, but below the top y ) = (x-y) - x*ln(x) + y*ln(y)<br><br>e.g., for the second-highest quintile,<br>P( top 0.4, but below the top 0.2 )<br>= (0.4-0.2) - 0.4*ln(0.4) + 0.2*ln(0.2) = 0.2446<br>= 24% chance of landing in the second-highest quintile<br><br>This time, the math comes from a cascade of continuous random variables:<br><br>Let benchmark "b" be a random real number from 0 to 1 (uniformly distributed).<br>Then, Colley's selection is another random real number from b to 1.<br>And presto, N has disappeared!<br>There is one catch: without N, there is no scenario of giving up and settling for the benchmark, which means we have implicitly assumed the search goes on and on until we beat it, no matter what. Logically, this is equivalent to assuming infinitely large N. There's always a tradeoff!<br><br>To justify this approach rigorously, we have to imagine a rating scale calibrated to the actual range of existing items (houses). That is, a 1.0 refers to your favorite of the actual existing houses that meet your specification, and a zero refers to your least-favorite of the same. In practice, you would not be able to rate the houses on this scale, since you would not be aware of the range of all houses in advance. But in principle, such a rating scale exists, and that is all we need for analysis.<br><br>This is an important point, because otherwise we might imagine that 1.0 corresponds to absolute perfection (it is math after all), and then the "top x" probabilities would be quite misleading. E.g., just because P( top 1% ) is 6%, this does not give you a 6% chance of finding an almost-perfect Mediterranean villa when shopping in the Bronx of New York.</div>

If only I were presently shopping for a house!<br><br>If you happen to have nothing like 100 items, you can still resort to my earlier expressions containing "N" to see how Colley's plays out. You'll have to add up chains of fractions, which might get old, or you might get a spreadsheet to do it. The result is very much the same as large N, letting you know that you can completely relax about the whole thing even if you haven't much idea what your "N" is.<br><br>Of course, if you have but limited faith in equations posted by strangers on the Internet, you can always go to <a href="http://www.random.org/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.random.org/</a> and see for yourself (thanks to Mark for that link!). Pull a dozen or so random numbers at a time, take the first as your benchmark, and scan for the next better one. It's amazing how high the results come out!<br><br>Now, if none of this ever bothered you in the first place—if at most you thought, "Colley's Rule, eh? Okay, I'm game"—then none of my work here will be of the slightest use to you. Except to pat you on the back for having been right all along. In particular, you do not need and cannot use any of this stuff when actually applying Colley's Rule or (I can't imagine!) the Final Version. These formulas are only for analysis.</div>
