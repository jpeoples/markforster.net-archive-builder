<h1>Review: "The To-Do List" by Mike Gayle</h1>

I expect most of us could draw up a similar list of unactioned items.</p>
<p>I’m not going to spoil the story by saying whether he succeeds - suffice it say that one of the people he consulted before he started was me!</p>
<p>The book is very entertaining and very instructive too. See how a to-do list can take on a life of its own. Even when he got discouraged and give it up he found that he was still mentally ticking off items. By the end he has discovered a lot about himself and about what is important in life.</p>
<p>In short: well worth reading.</p></div>

<div>Seriously though, we could all write up our experiences of various time management systems and they could form the backbone of a book.  What do you think?</div>

<div>If You think about it life is a natural list you tick off like take first steps or finish gcses with passes we all have goals but this book motivates people to make it a task in itself..I think all of us should try a list and see where the list takes you.. Orla</div>

<div>One thing I need to write a blog post about is what advice I would give Mike Gayle now that my new Autofocus system has been published.</div>
