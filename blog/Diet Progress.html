<div class="content"><p>I couldn’t believe my eyes this morning when I weighed in and found that I was 2 lbs below my target weight for the day. That means that since I introduced the <a href="/display/ShowJournal?moduleId=817806&currentPage=6&categoryId=75905">Ratchet Effect </a>on March 10th I have lost 6 lbs. That’s nearly 2 lbs per week. Although I am eating <em>much</em> less than I used to in my pre-diet days, I have not been feeling particularly hungry. That seems to me to mean that my body is adjusting quite well to my weight loss.</p></div>
