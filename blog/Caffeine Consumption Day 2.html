<h1>Caffeine Consumption: Day 2</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2008-02-28 0:30</div>
<div class="content"><p>I’ve just finished the day after midnight drinking my nineteenth cup of tea - truly a revolting experience!</p><p>The trouble is I don’t really know where to go from here. I certainly don’t feel at this precise moment that I ever want to see another cup of tea again, but will I still feel like that in the morning? And even if I do, how long will it last?</p><p>I think what I will do tomorrow is drink as much tea as I want naturally and record how many cups I drink. We’ll see whether the last two days’ exercise has had a beneficial effect or not.</p><p><em>Related posting:</em></p><p><a href="/blog/2008/2/27/caffeine-consumption-day-1.html">Caffeine Consumption: Day 1</a></p></div>

<div>I'm following your caffeine consumption "study" with a great degree of interest.  <br><br>I'm concerned that you are breaking a tea habit, but not a caffeine habit ... thereby leaving yourself open to starting a coffee habit?  Good luck and let us know how it goes.<br><br>Mike ... www.zendonut.com</div>

<div>Thanks, Mike.<br><br>Actually I very rarely drink coffee - usually only on formal occasions. So I don't think it is likely to be a problem.<br><br>Total tea consumption yesterday 12 cups.<br><br>Today (as of 3.45 p.m.) 5 cups.</div>
