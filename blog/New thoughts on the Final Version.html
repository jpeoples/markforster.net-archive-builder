<h1>New thoughts on the Final Version</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2012-03-11 9:11</div>
<div class="content"><p>I’ve had a radical rethink about the marketing of the <a href="../blog/New System Under Development.html">Final Version</a>. Instead of releasing it by publishing a book, my plan is now to release it free of charge as instructions only in an issue of my newsletter. I may start a new newsletter for the purpose, so wait for further instructions before signing up if you don’t already receive it.</p>
<p>I will then run a programme of reasonably cheap teleconferences and/or seminars to fill in the reality behind the instructions and deal with questions and difficulties.</p>
<p>I haven’t decided on a release date yet, but since it no longer depends on my getting a book written there is no reason why it can’t be sooner rather than later.</p></div>

<div>Have you considered doing a freebie with the basic system and follow up with a book that covers the system, and your thoughts on it it, in greater depth/detail. Perhaps pulling in some of the ideas & thoughts that have been developed since DIT was published (which btw I re-read every few months to keep me on track).<br><br>[Yes, that's very much what I intend to do, except that the book is now on a longer time-scale than the teleconferences and seminars. - MF]</div>

<div>That feels good to me Mark. Those with a modest level of interest will benefit from the "overview" in the newsletter, the highly committed will pay for the details and your nuances and expertise on a webinar/conference. Might just be fun to try a non-publishing route of course!</div>

<div>That might be a wise move, Mark - focusing on monetizing "value added" materials rather than just the knowledge of the system itself.<br><br>Even if the instructions for The Final Version were only sold in book form, the system might "leak out" anyway through people discussing it innocently which might seriously reduce sales. Not sure how you would have stopped that from happening.<br><br>[I agree. My experience has always been that people are willing to pay for more depth on something they already know is good. I made far more money in the past out of the seminars and coaching to which my books attracted people, than I ever did out of the books themselves. - MF.]</div>

<div>To save time, since I'm using a borrowed laptop which the owners would still quite like to be able to use themselves, where answers are needed in the above comments I have added the answer in square brackets to the comment itself.</div>

<div>+JMJ+<br><br>Oh goodness, Mark, you put up that link "The Final Version is Here!" then you put it down when I pressed on the link.  I hate your teasing.<br><br>EDIT: OH, there it is..and it still is a tease! :p<br><br>EDIT (2): And it's gone again.  ARGHHHHH!</div>

<div>All the best with this - but will I find time to read it...?!<br><br>[The newsletter will only contain the basic instructions - about two pages - MF]</div>

<div>Great news, Thank you. By the way, I like the innovation of replying in square brackets, very easy on the eye and brain!<br><br>[The trouble with it is that it makes it more difficult for people to see where I've made a new comment as it doesn't show up in the Latest Changes. Otherwise I'd use it more. - MF]</div>

<div>What you could do after Final Version:<br>Create a book or a course that teaches how to invent time/task management systems. Since everyone has different needs, that could be really useful.<br>In other words: A time management system creations system :-)<br><br>What do you think?</div>

<div>Mark, <br><br>Your FV is an ingenious idea. I'm delighted it can be my FV of your previous work. Although I've applied your list concept previously, it was always abandoned after awhile, while I've always been using other concepts from your book such as 'a little and often,' and closed lists' which have been a daily part of my life for years.<br><br>Getting back to your FV, writing my book heads the daily lists. And thinking what I want to do before writing each day has helped me clear up lots of lingering tasks, especially by using the little and often philosophy. For me, the psychological aspect of FV enables me to do more without fatigue. That's what happened the first day. It's also a spiritual aspect because I now look forward to each day's task. This hasn't been part of my life for a long while. <br><br>Randy Place<br>Greenwich CT USA<br><br>I offer sincere thanks to you, Mark, for hitting another home run.</div>
