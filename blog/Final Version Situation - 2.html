<h1>Final Version Situation - 2</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2012-03-9 6:06</div>
<div class="content"><p>There’s not been a lot of progress since I last posted due to the fact that I have been travelling constantly and it’s not been helped by my lap-top breaking. I’ve now reached my location for the next month, a fairly remote part of Queensland, so I now have the opportunity to get on with the book without too many interruptions - apart from the expected birth of a grandchild sometime in the next few weeks!</p>
<p>In the meantime I am very grateful for the many suggestions which the readers of this blog have left concerning the marketing of the book once I have written it. Please continue to make these!</p></div>

<div>Thanks for the update Mark. Enjoy your break and the no doubt beautiful surroundings (Photos would be nice!). I'm sure you will have a wonderful time with your family and the arrival of a grandchild has to be the most exciting event!<br><br>I think if you want serious sales from your book you are going to have a good look at all marketing opportunities - I suggest that you take a good look at social media to really get the word out (I am having success with this myself) and also look at delivering training both on a direct basis, as a consultancy and as webinars which could be pre-recorded. You could charge for all of these - although the 'in person' ones would be much more expensive, the webinars could be sold in bulk at a reasonable price. I know people who buy into webinars and then go on the book in to courses because they have enjoyed them so much and want a little of the 'magic' from the author.<br><br>Do you have a name for your new 'final system' yet?</div>

<div>Alison called it. Programs like Trailblazers and How to Start a Blog That Matters offer great examples of how others do that even as they teach you how to do the same. How Start looks quite applicable to you, Mark, especially since you've done enough that you could breeze through the first couple of weeks and get right to the meat of the training.</div>

<div>And you should definitely have a program where we'll be able to get an advance preview of the system rather than waiting for you to get the final book completed :-) [And I, at least, will be happy to pay for it.]</div>

<div>Alison:<br><br><< Photos would be nice!>><br><br>No doubt, but unfortunately my camera has broken as well as my laptop so it's just too difficult!</div>

<div>Oh no - technology failure!  You'll have to fix your camera or buy a new one before your new grandchild arrives otherwise you will be in serious trouble! I suppose you could just enjoy a technology free break for a change?</div>

<div>Good stuff, Mark. Hope you are making headway.<br><br>Have you included the writing of the book within your current FV pages, or are you blocking off exclusive time every day to write it?<br><br>Neil</div>
