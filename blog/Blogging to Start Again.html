<h1>Blogging to Start Again</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2016-09-22 17:32</div>
<div class="content"><p>Now that we’ve got back into our own house and life is gradually returning to something like normal - at least for a bit - I intend to start blogging again. It will probably be more sporadic than it was over the past year.</p>
<p>I intend to start with another post on the subject of randomness v. procrastination. Coming soon!</p></div>

<div>Hi Mark - I've been away from internet connection all month and now that I'm back I was shocked and saddened  to hear that your cancer has returned.  However, I'm not at all shocked or surprised that you'll be continuing to blog - that's typical of your generosity in sharing your ideas with this online community. You are an absolute inspiration, as others have said. <br><br>Very best wishes.</div>
