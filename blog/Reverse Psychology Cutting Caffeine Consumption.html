<h1>Reverse Psychology: Cutting Caffeine Consumption</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2008-02-25 17:56</div>
<div class="content"><p>A reader’s comment on one of my articles reminded me of a <a href="/blog/2006/9/17/my-favourite-time-management-tool.html#comment1318225">technique for giving up smoking</a> which I had read about somewhere many years ago. The idea was to stop smoking being a pleasure and make it into a chore by giving oneself the compulsory task of smoking a certain number of cigarettes during a day.</p><p>As soon as I remembered this, I thought that I’d like to try it out. Since I gave up smoking over thirty years ago, I can’t use it for that purpose. But there <em>is </em>something I want to cut down on (or perhaps even cut out altogether) and that is caffeine. I don’t drink coffee, but I do drink endless cups of tea. I wonder if it’ll work for that?</p><p>So tomorrow I have the task of drinking as much tea as I like - without restraint. And then the following day I HAVE to drink the <em>same number</em> of cups. What happens after that? I’m not quite sure… I’ll have to make it up when I get there!</p><p>Tomorrow evening I’ll report back on how many cups I drink tomorrow - and it’ll be a lot!</p></div>
