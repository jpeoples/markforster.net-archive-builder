<h1>Getting Going Again: First Week Update</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2008-02-26 18:40</div>
<div class="content"><p>After just one week of getting back on the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0340909129?tag=markforstthet-21&camp=1406&creative=6394&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=0340909129&adid=04WWDDGHJG5BEQBRWM66&" target="_blank">Do It Tomorrow </a>system, I can’t believe how my life has been transformed. I’m experiencing renewed energy and am moving forwards on all fronts. And as always seems to happen when one starts to move forward, opportunities have begun to open up in front of me.</p><p>Specifically I have got rid of all backlogs and so am completely up-to-date. I’ve rejuvenated my blog, got going again on my newsletter, started to develop ideas for new products and generally feel that I’m in the driving seat again.</p><p>And I’ve done all this without working later than 3.30 p.m. any day this week. With one exception - today!</p><p>Today my computer started playing up badly in the morning and I got the “blue wall of death” twice. However I couldn’t do much about it then because I had a meeting at 11.45 a.m. When I got back from this at 3.30 p.m. I was able to sort the problem out fairly comprehensively but it didn’t leave much time to finish my Will Do list for the day. Bear in mind that in <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0340909129?tag=markforstthet-21&camp=1406&creative=6394&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=0340909129&adid=04WWDDGHJG5BEQBRWM66&" target="_blank">Do It Tomorrow </a>terminology a computer breakdown is an “Immediate” task, since it prevents one from doing any other work.</p><p>So I’ve finished the working day with a whole load of tasks to carry forward to tomorrow. That is absolutely nothing to worry about. It is bound to happen from time to time, and is only a cause for concern if one can’t catch up after 3 or 4 days.</p><p>Finally, here’s my “What’s Better?” list for my <a href="/blog/2008/2/26/new-current-initiative.html">new Current Initiative </a>- sorting out my office:</p><ul><li><div>Wrote blog entry on the subject</div></li><li><div>Moved books back onto shelves</div></li><li><div>Made a start on sorting out books</div></li><li><div>Tidied area around shredder of bits of paper</div></li></ul><p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0340909129?tag=markforstthet-21&camp=1406&creative=6394&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=0340909129&adid=04WWDDGHJG5BEQBRWM66&" target="_blank"><span class="sizeLess20"><u><font style="color: #800080" color="#800080">Buy Do It Tomorrow</font></u></span></a></p></div>

<div>I would - if it weren't for the constant emails I get from Mac owners who can't read this or can't download that.</div>
