<h1>Change to Fast FVP</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2018-01-6 16:17</div>
<div class="content"><p>As the system I was testing didn’t work out the way I was hoping, I’ve changed to <a href="../blog/Fast FVP.html">Fast FVP</a> which is proving to be everything I’ve been looking for. A bit of loosening up of the rules has made it much more flexible and seems to have overcome most of the problems I have found with it before and with such systems as Simple Scanning and FVP.</p>
<p>Basically what I’ve done is to stick to what I said in the first paragraph of the Fast FVP article without adding the further complications in that article.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span><em>“Whenever a task is dotted which I am ready to do right now I stop scanning and do it. That’s all there is to it - it’s as simple as that, but the effect on the speed of the system is enormous.”</em></span></p>
<p><span>However that’s not going to make much sense to anyone who reads this without being already acquainted with FVP and FV. So here’s a complete set of rules. As always, I’ve written the rules for paper and pen, but it’s easy to implement them electronically if you so wish:</span> </p>
<ol>
<li>Fast FVP is intended to be used with a “catch-all” list, i.e. a full list of everything you have to do.</li>
<li>It is better to start off with a few tasks and build the list up gradually rather than attempt to write everything out to begin with. That way the list will build up naturally and you will be more aware of what is on it.</li>
<li>Dot the first task on the list. You can do it straight away if you want to, but if you don’t want to you carry on scanning through the list dotting tasks that you intend to do.</li>
<li>At any stage you can either work on the task you have just dotted or carry on down the list dotting further tasks.</li>
<li>When you have worked on a task you cross it out and re-enter it at the end of the list if further work is needed on it.</li>
<li>You then can either work on the previous dotted task or carrying on dotting further tasks.</li>
<li>That’s basically it, but there are two rules dealing with the beginning and end of the list:<ol>
<li>Whenever you delete the first task on the list the new first task must be dotted</li>
<li>Whenever you reach the end of the list you must work on the last dotted task on the list.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>To sum up, except where rules 7.1 and 7.2 apply you always have a choice of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Working on the last dotted task on the list OR</li>
<li>Adding further dots after the task you have just done.</li>
</ul>

  </div>

  <div class="follow-up-body">

    <p>Afternote:</p>
<p>Fast FVP acts like a mixture of FV, FVP and Simple Scanning. In fact you can simulate FV and FVP within the rules of Fast FVP, and you can also simulate Simple Scanning with the one change that you have to do the first task on the list on each pass. You can also switch between them at any stage.</p>
<p>I’m not suggesting that you should consciously think about this while doing Fast FVP. I’m just pointing out how very flexible the system is.</p>

<div>Does this system still use standing out for finding the next task to dot?</div>

<div>Like it!<br>Can I check what happens after 7.2? Does that mean you must do all the tasks previously dotted in a strict LIFO basis?<br>Or can you choose in which order you would like to do the previously dotted tasks?<br>Can you un-dot a task - i.e. Defer it?</div>

<div>Mr. Backlog:<br><br><<Can I check what happens after 7.2? >><br><br>7.2 is a special case rule because rule 6 can't apply when you have reached the end of the list. The reason is that here are no further tasks you can dot. <br><br><< Does that mean you must do all the tasks previously dotted in a strict LIFO basis? >><br><br>Rule 6 will then apply as normal. i.e. you can do the previous dotted task or carry on dottng more tasks<br><br><< Can you un-dot a task - i.e. Defer it? >><br><br>I don't see why not, though this system is much faster at getting dotted tasks done than FVP so the need shouldn't arise too often. If you want to remove it from the list altogether that's fine too.</div>

<div>What prevents me from using Fast FVP is what I would call "spoilage of dotted tasks": after a certain amount of time the dotted tasks that were not acted on would lose relevance while some of the undotted tasks above them would gain relevance. Otherwise I really want Fast FVP to work for me.</div>

<div>nuntym:<br><br><< after a certain amount of time the dotted tasks that were not acted on would lose relevance while some of the undotted tasks above them would gain relevance. >><br><br>See my reply to MrBacklog.<br><br>What I recommended for FVP is that if you want to change the priorities of certain items you cross them out and put them at the end of the list. It's much neater than trying to scribble out dots in situ. The same would work for Fast FVP.<br><br>However you move much faster up and down the list with Fast FVP than you do with FVP so the situation shouldn't arise too often.</div>

<div>OK Mark, I took the plunge and started to use FFVP on my old list, using your advice as inspiration to change the scanning procedure from a two-part questioning as described in the original Fast FVP article to a questionless intuitive procedure.  <br><br>Once I dot a task or go back to a dotted task I linger for less than a second, instructing my intuition to choose between three options: "ready", "not yet", or "no".  "Ready" means that I am ready to do the dotted task and do not need to scan any further.  "Not yet" means scan down until another task "stands out," upon which I use this procedure again.  "No" means that the dotted task has become irrelevant and should be deleted, if needed rewritten at the end, then go to the previous dotted task and repeat the procedure again.<br><br>This is working remarkably well right now: it is really fast, has not met any resistance yet, and  is very intuitive.</div>

<div>nuntym:<br><br><< instructing my intuition to choose between three options: "ready", "not yet", or "no".>><br><br>I don't use the "no" option because it's only really needed if you've been away from the list some time, but if it works fine for you stick to it.<br><br>You'll probably find after you've done it for a bit that you don't need to think about the options any longer.<br><br>Pob lwc!</div>

<div>A thought - I can see how this system would work well when the list is relatively short. <br><br>However as time passes and eventually everything gets on the list, for some people it is going to be a very long list. That is certainly the case for me.<br><br>I would expect some problems to arise. In particular, when a task is partly done near the start of the list and then needs to be re-entered at end of the list. In the normal course of working through the list it might take quite a long time to ever get to that task again, maybe a few weeks in my case. If it has some deadline on it, then it could be missed?<br>I suppose all our tasks will have some sort of rough due date before they become a problem if not done, but this system does not seem to have a way of catering for that?<br>Any thoughts on a solution?<br>With real auto focus, the deferral bit to a calender seemed to solve that, so it pops back into focus at the right time.</div>

<div>Following on from above, this is a work in progress issue.<br>The higher that is, the harder it is to ensure important tasks are done at the right time.<br>The systems needs to control that.</div>

If a task is at or near the end of the list, it's immediately available to be worked on again.<br><br>If it's taking you a week to work through the list, then you're doing it wrong - whatever the length of your list.

<div>MrBacklog: <br><br>I think if you have things that might need to be worked on at the end of the list, you should find them quickly while scanning. If I were you I would dot things based on knowing the rules that you would work on the last dotted item if you reach the end of the list. Basically if you are concerned about prioritization then steer your decisions more towards a FVP style.<br><br>I think a dot would basically mean "I think I will work on this unless I find something even better."<br><br>You know how the random method removes all resistance to the selected task? It's because we decide to do whatever comes up regardless of the order. But if you want to order your tasks you probably need to resist them more (the tasks you are working on in FFVP) long enough to get to the end of the list to make sure you're hitting all your timelines.<br><br>I used to have a lot of problems with ever making it through the lists. I don't have that problem with  FVP. That's why I think a more FVP style might help.</div>

<div class="comment-meta">MrBacklog - 2018-01-7 15:04</div>
<div>Mark:<br>OK that makes sense. I interpreted the rules as meaning that when you make a whole pass through the list and get to the end, you can only work backwards via the last dotted task, which seems quite restrictive.<br>Should instruction line 4 read:-<br>At any stage you can either work on ANY task you have just dotted or carry on down the list dotting further tasks.<br><br><<If it's taking you a week to work through the list, then you're doing it wrong>><br><br>I think this is a work in progress issue. If no new tasks came in, it might take me 2-3 weeks to clear all the ones left. I wonder if that is typical for a lot of people? I don't expect there are many who have a 1-2 day work in progress/turnaround in all their work?<br><br>Anyway, I not sure if I'm doing anything wrong. It is more a case of the higher the work in progress the harder it is to manage to ensure I don't miss deadlines.<br>It seems a constant dilemma of which tasks to tackle as I lose track of when everything is due.<br>I suppose there are a lot of backlogs in the world. e.g. The NHS has a massive backlog, but they just have to carry on in a crisis.</div>

<div>I was very happy using FVP with a very long list - it was a very chaotic time at work, situation and priorities changing very frequently, and I could easily go for weeks without seeing the top of the list.<br><br>And it was totally fine - in fact, it was the best possible result, I think.<br><br>At one point, I took a breather, and looked back at the older pages:<br>- There were many dotted items that had become totally irrelevant. <br>- There were many undotted items that had been entered and actioned later through the normal course of things (i.e., they came back by themselves without any prompting from the list). <br>- There were a few things that seemed like they had been neglected and were still important - so I re-entered them at the end of the list. But many of those things that felt important at the time, still never got done, even after I re-entered them. So it turns out they really weren't that important.<br><br>I eventually got into the habit of just ignoring all those early pages I hadn't seen in a long time -- and it was fine. Sometimes I would just delete a bunch of them without reviewing them -- and it was fine.<br><br>Later, doing no-list, I came to have a deeper appreciation for why this all worked out OK: The really important stuff has a tendency to come back by itself. Cycling back to the top item on the list gives one a sense of closure and completeness, which is really nice, but learning to live without the psychological need for the closure and completeness is perhaps even better. At least sometimes. :-)</div>

<div>Don R:<br>Thanks for that. <br>I suppose a simple solution to help with priority is to star for the more urgent and dot for the tasks that can wait a bit longer?<br>That should do it?</div>

<div class="comment-meta">MrBacklog - 2018-01-7 15:29</div>
<div>Seraphim:<br>Yes that is interesting.<br>What I have actually been doing recently each day is working part on the most recent tasks and part on the oldest as that certainly works for me.<br>That seems to be the only sensible way to keep a long list working fine so old deadlines don't slip and keeping on top of all the new important stuff coming in. The not so important tasks (but need to be done at some point) automatically filter to the middle of the list.<br>I thank myself quite regularly for always looking at the oldest stuff when I see what could happen if neglected!<br>Any more thoughts on how to handle that are welcome!<br>NB I don't actually keep lists but I'm referring to say 100 emails in my inbox which I suppose is the same concept as a handwritten list of things to do.</div>

<div>With regard to deadlines, for any of the long list systems, I put the deadline in brackets after the item.  For example, "Submit abstract for FM2018 (d/l: 8/1/18)".  I like this because I have just one thing to look at instead of two (list and calendar), and I get a reminder of all my upcoming deadlines every time I scan the list.</div>

<div>MrB,<br><br>I think Mark's point about eMail subject lines (a personal bugbear) is a real issue. Also, you need to find a way to "dot" then that carries across to all devices (unless you only ever do tasks sitting at a computer).<br><br>One option for office 365 users is to drag or right drag mails requiring action to tasks, and use Microsoft to-do. Where the subject is unclear, you can quickly type in the actual action.<br><br>Then use the "My day" list to hold the dotted actions (a quick swipe from the to-do list).<br><br>I've been using a pocket Moleskine, but I might give this a go.</div>

<div>Will:<br>I suppose 2 quick solutions to those email issues to think about: -<br><br>1. Turn on the email preview. It then automatically shows the text in the email so you can quickly scan what it is about without having to actually open the email. I prefer the preview box to be to the right, rather than underneath.<br>2. Flag the emails which can be the equivalent of a dot.<br><br>Or as you say, dragging it into tasks also works.</div>

<div>Mr. Backlog,<br><br>You are dotting too many tasks. The people who liked the original FV had short chains. It's a comparison method. You only dot things that are greater than the previous thing, _not_ all the things you could or should do. (More want, more stand-out, more valuable -- we tried several questions, all are comparing to the previous dotted line.)<br><br>+++<br><br>Email<br><br>I manage many of my tasks through an email inbox.<br><br>We need to define Email Inbox.<br><br>Most programs define Inbox as "where it stays until you move it."<br><br>If we define it as "marked as Unread", then I agree, we should not work directly from it. We need to open new mail, scan it, and decide what to do with it. We also need to look for fires, and get an idea of what work is waiting for us. GTD suggests only 30 seconds per item. Processing the inbox is very fast!<br><br>Once I decide what to do about an email, I'm happy to save a few clicks and leave it in what Gmail calls my Inbox, marked "read". I only move them to a different list if there's a good reason. One good reason is collecting things for a project. Another good reason is getting less urgent tasks, such as reading newsletters, off the screen, so the rest stand out better, in which case I create a "read December's newsletters" project.<br><br>Most things arriving through email are @desk tasks, so what Gmail calls Inbox-read is actually part of my @desk list.<br><br>I find the subject line and sender are usually enough to remind me of what the email is about. In the rare cases it isn't, I use labels or just deal with it immediately.</div>

<div><<You are dotting too many tasks. The people who liked the original FV had short chains. It's a comparison method>>.<br><br>Yes I agree, I think it is best just to dot a few, deal with them and then move on to the next lot for review.<br>Actually what really happens in the end is that I allocate about 2-3 hours each day for email and I just blast through the oldest ones and then the newest ones. I can't get them all done, but that process keeps them all moving.<br>I defer any that can't be done into a future folder or blind copy myself in for any that need a response. I chase non-responders about 3-4 weeks later. It is easy just to forward the first email. Surprising how many don't respond!<br>I don't really bother with scanning or dotting/flagging.

<div>Back on topic, I think MrB asked what to do if your thinking changes after you have set up a chain of dotted tasks, so that the low priority task at the base of the chain is now calling for your attention. It seems to me that the possibilities are:<br><br>1. just do it, then go back to where you were<br>2. write it again and when you have finished the current bit of work, dot it in the usual way<br>3. follow the usual process until you get back to the base: if you are doing several passes a day, this shouldn't take long.<br><br>In fact, the fact that this is seen as a potential problem may indicate that the process is not yet flowing.</div>

<div>As I scan the list with this Fast FVP model, here is how the tasks speak to me:<br>- Some tasks say "YES!" -- dot those and do them immediately<br>- Some tasks say "YES, but..." -- these are the ones where the task stands out, but I feel I need to check what else is on the list before diving into it. Dot and keep scanning.<br>- Some tasks say "NO! Delete me!" -- old, irrelevant, or already-completed tasks. Gone.<br>- Some tasks don't say anything. Leave them for now.<br><br>Mark, is that basically how it's supposed to work?</div>

<div>Hi Mark, Thank you so much for your amazing devotion to paper-based productivity over the years and super high-quality blog and info. I read you along time ago, loved AF, then I switched to a whole string of electronic solutions that I never liked as much, and now I'm back to your advice and paper lists. <br><br>I have read almost all your systems since AF in the last few days. I was very attracted to the 2-column approach of SF. But I noticed you abandoned this in subsequent systems like FV, and FVP. Fast FVP seems great, and I am trying it, but why not include the second column? <br><br>It seems to add a layer of both flexibility and organization / categorization and quicker scanning to the system. The second column could be used as a tickler column, re-written each page. Or an urgent column. Or an important column. It seems like it could be a nice way to highlight some particular category of tasks. And the dot method could be applied to it like column 1. <br><br>Did you encounter some weakness with the second column approach that makes it incompatible in the newer systems? <br><br>If you explained this in a previous post, I didn't find it, but happy to read if it's easier to point me there. Thank you! - David</div>

<div>Any chance FFVP could be added to the FVP forum for more extended discussions? I suppose it would depend on how long you plan to update/tinker with the system before moving on to another system and how many of the visitors to this site are interests in FFVP. I am using the system daily and would like to see some extended discussions beyond the comments from the single blog entry. Just an idea.</div>

<div>@davidpapa<br><br><<Did you encounter some weakness with the second column approach that makes it incompatible in the newer systems? >><br><br>My opinion, not necessarily Mark's, is that the SF second column was a failed experiment.  It had the effect of making the system slow because you were required to act on everything in that column before turning the page.  This idea of obligation is something Mark recently has been writing against himself.  Instead now, he advocates a system that leaves you completely free, with the driving idea that the point of a system is NOT to get everything done, but to enable you to effectively and efficiently choose what gets done. SF contradicts that by requiring you to get things get done.  At the same time, it made progress through the system very slow, and while you did accomplish some things very quickly by cycling through, other things you never even get to in reasonable time.<br><br>The system also had a problematic complexity.  It made you think very deliberately about what "done" meant, making decisions about setting aside a task much harder than they should be.  So rather than having a very smooth flow to the system, it felt very cumbersome to use effectively.  I believe an effective operational system needs to be extremely smooth and not require thinking about how to operate.  SF did not achieve that for me.<br><br>None of this means you can't use a second column effectively, if you have different rules in mind.  And of course, there were many people who disagree with me and found the system effective.</div>

<div>FFVP has evolved to a purely questionless/intuitive system for me, wherein I let my intuition "stand out" tasks for me and tell me why it has made them stand out through a spectrum of feelings about them.<br><br>1. A feeling towards "attraction" or "approval" means I am ready to do it: I stop scanning down and do the dotted task.<br>2. A feeling towards "ambivalence" or "uncertainty" means I am not ready to do it: I keep on scanning down.<br>3. A feeling towards "repulsion" means I do not want to do it: I delete the dotted task and (if needed, explanation below) rewrite at the end.<br><br>It is the listening to this feeling of "repulsion" that made this system a game changer for me, since it seemed to unleash, as it were, my intuition to help me keep both my list and my chain of dotted tasks fresh and relevant.  Not only does this remove old, irrelevant, and already done tasks from my list, but this also handles what I called in a post above the "spoilage of dotted tasks."<br><br><<"spoilage of dotted tasks": after a certain amount of time the dotted tasks that were not acted on would lose relevance while some of the undotted tasks above them would gain relevance.>></div>

<div>Hi Mark,<br><br>There is a question I always wanted to ask you: You seem to not mind switching tasks every 5 minutes or so.<br><br>From my understanding, that would be a way to train our brain to require frequent changing (so we become more distracted), and there are switching costs between tasks where we need at least 20 minutes for the brain to fully focus on one task. Some people like Peter Drucker go as far as to argue that we should focus on one thing for at least 2 hours to reap the most benefits.<br><br>So, why are you still such a huge fan of switching between many tasks every day? Is it because you find that pushing through resistance will backfire over time, so better ride the wave than not? Well, what if by sticking to longer periods of time, you can train your brain to be comfortable with focusing on one thing for 1 hour or more, so a unit of 1 hour becomes as comfortable as a unit of 5-10 minutes, but we never find out because we haven't trained our brains for higher focus since we switch contexts frequently?<br><br>Another question that might or might not be related: on my life, there are some tasks that I have to do but they're not the most enjoyable for me, and some other tasks that are enjoyable but are not urgent or even critical. For example, I might have a task of writing follow up emails which I have to do but do not particularly enjoy, and a task of reading a novel which I am looking forward to do and I am excited about. So, following scanning systems where I do what I feel like doing, I'll be doing A LOT more of the "fun" tasks and those more important less enjoyable tasks will take much much longer to do (for example, a task that would require 8 hours of work might end up done after 16 days instead of 2 days). Any advice on this?<br><br>There seems to be a clash between what needs to be done and what I want to be done.</div>

<div>@ProductivityLover <br><br>An advice by Mark Forster to me might help here: clarify what you <really> want.  Do you want to have fun or do work?  That is the thing with Mark's systems, in that you have to be in touch with who you really want to be to be able to choose what you really want.  <br><br>Our intuition is not magic: it needs data from the outside world and instructions from us to know what to choose for us.  Just be more consistent with your wants and it will serve you well.<br><br>Also, I have noticed that if I listen closely to my intuition I notice a deeper want to live better below the shallower, noisier want to have fun.  It just takes practice to listen to that more silent wanting.<br><br>On the other hand, Mark Forster has said before that using the "little and often" rule excessively, i.e. splintering up a task too much, actually does make productivity suffer.  I do not think however he offered a way to know when is it too much, but I am willing to bet if he does it would be "whatever your intuition tells you."  <br><br>But for this you really have to let your intuition run freely.  And I have to thank you ProductivityLover for giving me inspiration on a possible way on how to do that even more with FFVP.</div>

<div>I observe a key difference in the rules.  Previously, the rules said, "You move through the list in order until you come to a task which you want to do more than the last dotted task."  Now, the rule is "You can do it straight away if you want to, but if you don’t want to you carry on scanning through the list dotting tasks that you intend to do."<br><br>I'm not talking about 'do it straight away', but about "dotting tasks that you intend to do" rather than "come to a task which you want to do more".<br><br>This is huge.  You're replacing the "want more than" with "want", which makes the system much easier to execute, because the thinking is much simpler.  (It's so different, it makes me want to confirm: Is this the intended way of reading of this rule?)<br><br>You also don't have to deal with the problem of "Do i want to do this task that doesn't much attract me, more than that first task which i totally don't want to do", which is a rather fruitless question and leads to dotting an initial series of tasks you really don't intend to do.  I guess change all ties in with the new philosophy of "you should not do everything" in that the new rules no longer push you to do things.<br><br>You do lose the natural ordering of tasks this way, in that you are just picking a bunch of tasks to do, and not establishing a logic order of doing them.  Though I suppose the answer to this is, anything that isn't ready to do now won't be selected until it becomes ready.</div>

<div>Alan Baljeu:<br><br><< You do lose the natural ordering of tasks this way >><br><br>That may be theoretically true, but as Seraphim has pointed out there's a certain level of prioritizing which it's pointless to go beyond. Also priorities are constantly changing - however one defines them - and the new rules react better to that. In the original FVP it could take a long time to work from one end of the list to the other and low priorities one marked up yesterday could easily now no longer be in the right place in the queue.</div>

<div>@Mark<br><br>If a task came in that I felt strongly that I wanted to do as soon as possible (an internal pushing rather than an "urgent" external pushing), I would add it to the pseudo-AF1 page - that still comes under the "urgent" category for me. But otherwise that "page" is closed. New tasks are added to the main task list but left undotted so they are not part of the pseudo-AF1 page..<br><br>As time goes on, the pseudo-AF1 page diminishes in size because tasks that I've worked on, and no longer feel any enthusiasm for working on any more at that time, are moved (rewritten) to the end of the main task list (in an AF1 kind of way), and therefore become un-dotted.<br><br>Because I'm looking at a filtered view of dotted tasks in my electronic system, I'm seeing this pseudo page as a separate actual page - a peaceful oasis away from the master task list length and chaos :-) - and I see it getting smaller and smaller which gives me a sensation of accomplishment.<br><br>And because these are all tasks I felt some enthusiasm for initially (the no-more-enthusiasm tasks are gradually "undotted" by being moved/rewritten to the end of the main task list), I find the enthusiasm for doing stuff stays fresh all day i.e. I don't resist my main task list because I'm rarely bullying myself into doing things off it.<br><br>If a task is finished then, yes, it is removed from the pseudo-AF1 page.</div>

<div>Great system. Quick question: Would you still need to dot the first task on the list?</div>

<div>A few days ago, I realised that I hadn't been following the rules as written for this last month.<br><br>"To sum up, except where rules 7.1 and 7.2 apply you always have a choice of:<br><br>Working on the last dotted task on the list OR<br>Adding further dots after the task you have just done."<br><br>I was working the system as if the rule was "Adding further dots after the last dotted task on the list".<br><br>With Fast FVP as written, there's a little more compulsion in the system.  <br><br>If a dotted task is one that I'm resisting, then my method allowed me to keep on working the list below it forever (and so blocking all the tasks above it in the list).  With Fast FVP as written, the list of things that you can choose instead of the task you're resisting keeps getting shorter.<br><br>On the other hand, Fast FVP as written needs you to keep your finger in the notebook on the last worked task while you scan back for the last dotted task.  Not very inconvenient, except at the end of a day.<br><br>I handle this by picking tomorrow's first task at the end of each day.  That is, I re-enter the last task if necessary, delete it, then look at the previous dotted task and ask "What do I want to do first tomorrow?"  If it's not the last dotted task, I dot tasks until I've dotted one I do want to do first thing tomorrow, then close the notebook and go home.</div>

<div>Hello, Mark! I think this system is a bright example of elegant thinking. Fast FVP looks simple and lightweight, as pair of shoes, but without it i wouldn't go on the road.<br>After using several days i can say only, that it works for me better than any other systems. But i have a question ;-) I tried to read all the comments to find the answer but my english is pretty bad and i could lose something.<br>For example, i dotted a few tasks (let's call them A,B,C,D).<br>When i have made last task (D), the next should be C, or scanning further. But (and this happens quite often) what if the task B become urgent? F.e. i have to go (or sleep) and have few minutes to accomplish the most importent task for the moment (or the day). And it is B. And i don;t have time/energy for task C. Should i remove the dot at C or cross it out and replace in the and of the list, or can i cheat somehow?:-)</div>

<div>Hi Mark<br><br>I'm really liking this system, thank you.  My current list is quite small, which is good.  When I get to the end of the list, according to rule 7.2 I must work on the last dotted task on the list.  However, often the last dotted task happens to be the first dotted task on the list (which always must be dotted).<br><br>Procrastination aside, I may not be ready to take action on this task for whatever reason, so I would propose an amendment to the rule to allow a scan down the list past the first dotted item to see if there are other tasks which stand out and which would therefore be dotted on this scan.  This makes a lot more sense to me, rather than forcing myself to work on the first task.  Or do you disagree because there is a risk that the first task may become forgotten about hence why it is dotted?<br><br>Curious as to the reason why the first task is always dotted? Is it simply so you can easily spot where it is or because it is important to take some form of action on it, however small?</div>

<div>Mark<br><br><<That rule would be pointless since you should already have identified and done every task you want to do before the first task.>><br><br>Not necessarily. If your task list has been going for several days, then the priority of tasks may well change (as I think you've already touched on), so there may be tasks further down the list which can be dotted that you'd want to do before the first dotted task (i.e. which weren't dotted in previous scans).  So I still believe that if you're taken back to the first dotted item on the list following completion of the last dotted item, then scanning and dotting items (where required) following the first dotted item is a good idea, rather than automatically working on the first dotted item as I think the current rule suggests.</div>

<div>After some time with FFVP, I've reverted to Simple Scanning with just one enhancement, that I start the day on the 2nd-to-last page. Even during the day, if I've lost my place or if I had previously petered out somewhere on the last page, I resume on that 2nd-last page.<br><br>I found that I really resisted FFVP's flipping back to find the previous dot, and I do not tend to get back up to the top of the list very often. My sessions are pretty short, since I now use the list only at home, and at work my team uses an entirely different kanban-based system. Well... I do bring the list to work, because I tend to have a reminder or two on its last page, like a personal phone call to make during business hours. So when I get home, the list is always open to the last page due to that reminder, and anything on those last two pages seems much more relevant than whatever I dotted yesterday or the day before, higher up the list.<br><br>I do keep an eye out for the oldest item on the list as I come around the top of it, and I tend to give it some special consideration, either to push it along or delete it. So I guess that's a second enhancement but just a rule of thumb, a habit ingrained by FFVP.</div>

<div>Bernie:<br>This has also been a source of resistance for me. I have posted about it in the FV/FVP forum in the post "Switching from FVP-Q to FFVP". I have also actually been thinking about switching back to my old system, which is FVP-Q instead of Simple Scanning. <br><br>Another source of resistance I have is always asking myself "Am I ready for this?" It produces more mental overhead compared to FVP-Q where you just dot what stands out going to the end of the list and do the last dotted task.</div>

<div>james220,<br><br>I've completely stopped using any sort of question for the same reason, another reason Simple Scanning suits me better. Without the question, FVP's sorting algorithm is not invoked. And I was never able to get the sorting to happen with a nonverbal "standing out" approach--not that it was a big problem, but it negated the point of having those previously-dotted items lurking around. All those wonderful dynamics Mark listed about Simple Scanning are still working great for me, and it's even nicer to know I can always start right at the most relevant spot, on that 2nd-to-last page.<br><br>I think it was this post that described the dynamics I'm referring to:<br><a href="../blog/Simple Scanning - Clumping, Attenuation and Maturity.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2017/12/13/simple-scanning-clumping-attenuation-and-maturity.html</a></div>

<div>I'd like to clarify a special case when working FFVP. Let's say that my list is sufficiently up-to-date that I have no need to re-prioritize by deleting and re-entering any tasks without actually working them. I've just finished working on the item at the very end of the list. I'm not completely clear on my choices from this point. They seem to be either:<br><br>a) Work on the (new) last dotted item<br>b) Write new items at the end of the list, dot some, and carry on as usual.<br><br>This seems to be in keeping with the theme that, once you have scanned to the very end of the list, the system has helped you find out what to do _now_ (the last dotted item).<br><br>Is that about right?<br><br>--V</div>

<div>Voluntas,<br><br>First scan down from the task you have just completed to the end of the list, dotting according to the usual rules. <br><br>As you dot them, either do them or carry on dotting until you get to the bottom of the list. When you get to the bottom of the list, do the bottom dotted task.<br><br>Repeat.</div>

<div>Will,<br><br>That doesn't really answer my question. I understand the rules in general, it's the special case at the very end of the list that I'm trying to figure out.</div>

<div>Cajun:<br><br><< I've been wondering what to do with completed tasks. >><br><br>I'm not sure what you mean by this. A fully completed task, or one you don't expect recur for several days, is deleted.<br><br>A task which is completed for the time being, but which you expect to recur again within a couple of days or less, is re-entered at the end of the list.<br><br>A task which is unfinished and which you are taking a break from while you do some other tasks is also re-entered at the end of the list.</div>

<div>Hello Mark / Forum members <br>Once query I have is do you keep one note book ( for both Work and Personal tasks / goals )  or you keep multiple ( say 1 for Work and other for Personal Tasks ). <br><br>I use one for work and other for Personal. I observed that most of my work time is in office and so I tend to ignore the ones in my Personal. On the other hand, if I put all the task in one, it becomes to clumsy to follow up. <br><br><br>Any generic solution to handle this would help. I am using FFVP as of now.</div>

<div>Amit:<br><br>People's circumstances differ so much that it is very difficult to lay down a hard and fast rule. Generally my advice is to keep separate books for each location. But you need to adapt that to your own particular situation.</div>
