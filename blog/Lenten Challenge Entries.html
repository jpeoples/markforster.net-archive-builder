<div>I have been revisiting past techniques that I used to use before I got into a lockdown rut. So I’m using Dreams. I have a Future vision and am self-coaching daily, (my future self is so insightful). I am also using a “Mind Dump,” usually in the morning, where I just write down whatever comes to mind. I have also lost 13.5 pounds in 20 days and this is integrated into my vision. So “all the good things since” I started this approach:<br>Songs writing from nowhere 15 songs<br>Unconscious retrieval – is amazing what my future self comes up with<br>Dreams itself have started rereading the book<br>Ketogenic Diet Weight Loss<br>Alcohol break I’ve continued on the wagon<br>Bed early<br>I have cleaned the bathroom, the stairs twice the kitchen once and am chipping away at my office<br>Writing - using halving and Grammarly<br>Signed up for Mark Forster’s Lenten challenge.<br><br>I've agreed to do something Dream-based every day. What areas are a struggle?<br>Sometimes there is some resistance to self-coaching - which my future self-points out. <br>I have noticed I've become more assertive at work. <br>Not reading as much as I would like. <br>Need to work more on the objectives and make the vision more attractive. <br>I need to walk each day. <br>The positive change is in all different areas which feels random rather than in any specific area.</div>

<div>I blew it and stopped using DIT a couple weeks ago. I got very busy at work and had some personal issues going on and I just stopped maintaining it. I actually stopped using any system and now I am trying to get caught up and get organized again. I'm trying a homebrew system using some principles from this site.<br><br>This isn't an indictment of the system but more an issue of where I was at the time. DIT does take a fair amount of effort to maintain though.</div>

<div>Just for the record, I already failed the challenge earlier so badly I didn't manage to post an update until now.</div>

<div>How's everyone doing with their Lenten Challenge?  There's been a fair bit posted on GIRKIR, but it would be interesting to hear how all the other systems are holding up, now that we're past half-way.</div>

<div>I failed, close to the beginning, but I learned much from my failure that will contribute to a better system moving forward.</div>

<div>Yes going very well and still using GURKIR. It is a short list now and I use it with a calendar to schedule in things at certain times of the month. Everything is structured doing the tasks in blocks at the same times each day which works.<br>Procrastination has disappeared. In the past I was always thinking about some other urgent task that needed to be done so I was not concentrating on/rushing the task in hand. However, this GURKIR seems to help me concentrate on one thing at a time knowing all the other tasks will have their turn. A blinkered approach works well for me. I'm also not reacting so much to new tasks coming in thinking they need some urgent response when hardly any do. They can wait their turn and only pull out the really really urgents.</div>

<div>I faltered and have gone back to the long list. Writing the New Question at the top of the list is a great exercise and kept revealing stuff I had forgotten I needed to do. But I never fell into a good relationship with GIRKIR. Don't know why.</div>
