<h1>Keeping up with the discussion</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2009-01-8 17:42</div>
<div class="content"><p>The discussions about Autofocus appear to have attracted quite a following, and some people have even admitted to being quite addicted to reading them!</p>
<p>So here are a couple of tips to make it as easy as possible to keep up with the discussion. Quite a few of you may already have worked them out for yourselves of course.</p>
<ol>
<li>The threads in the Discussion Forum are sorted in order of the latest post. So to read all the posts that have come in since you last looked all you have to do is start with the first thread on the list and continue reading the threads until you come to one on which you have already read the last post</li>
<li>There is an RSS feed available for comments on blog posts. The URL to enter in your feed-reader is http://www.markforster.net/blog/rss-comments.xml</li>
</ol>
