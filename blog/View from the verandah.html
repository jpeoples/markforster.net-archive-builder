<div>Yeah, stunning. But whenever I think of the Australian outback, I worry about critters: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_funnel-web_spider" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_funnel-web_spider</a></div>

<div>The main worry here at the moment is floods.</div>

<div>Hope you're enjoying our beautiful Queensland weather, Mark.  Don't worry, the water will stop rising ... eventually.  It looks at this stage like this year's floods won't be as bad as the ones we had last year, so fear not -- you will be able to escape!<br><br>@avrum: Don't worry too much about spiders, snakes, etc, should you ever visit us down under.  The main things to be concerned about in Australia are heart disease and automobile accidents, just like anywhere else in the developed world :-)</div>

<div>Looks really beautiful - I bet you will find it hard to leave and come home - not just because of the view either - it must be wonderful to spend time with family that you don't get to see very often.</div>
