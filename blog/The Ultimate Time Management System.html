<h1>The Ultimate Time Management System?</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2013-06-13 15:55</div>
<div class="content"><p>I’ve put a question mark at the end of the title of this post, but I’m going to remove it if the system which I’m about to describe proves to be as good as I think it will.</p>
<p>For more years than I can count I’ve been trying to find a system which will have the following characteristics:</p>
<p>1. Universal capture - you can add all the tasks which you must do, should do or want to do.</p>
<p>2. It ensures that the difficult tasks - the ones that you tend to procrastinate over - get done, done quickly and done well.</p>
<p>3. It processes recurrent tasks (email, tidying, filing, mowing the lawn, paying bills, etc) quickly and efficiently so they don’t build up.</p>
<p>4. It can deal with urgent tasks with an appropriate degree of despatch.</p>
<p>5. The system itself has minimum overhead.</p>
<p>6. The system itself doesn’t raise resistance by forcing you to do things you don’t want to do.</p>
<p>This is the first system I have ever come across, whether mine or someone else’s, that fulfills all six of these requirements.</p>
<p>It is based on an earlier system of mine, Autofocus 4 (AF4). For those of you who remember it, I have only made one structural change to it. The change is that unfinished tasks are now retained in the Old List until they are completed. However you don’t need to know AF4 to understand the new system.</p>
<p>Here are the rules:</p>
<p>1. You have two lists, an Old List and a New List.</p>
<p>2. Start by filling the Old List with all the tasks you want to get done. I suggest you put on it everything you’d like to get finished in the next couple of weeks or so. At this stage the New List remains empty.</p>
<p>3. Start working on the tasks in the Old List. If any new tasks come up you put them in the New List. No new tasks should be added to the Old List.</p>
<p>4. You can do the tasks in the Old List in any order you like. Continue working on the tasks in the Old list for as long as you feel like it.</p>
<p>5. When you’ve finished a task, delete it from the Old List. If it’s a recurring task, re-enter it at the end of the New List.</p>
<p>6. You don’t have to finish a task when you work on it. When you want to stop working on a task in the Old List without finishing it, delete it and re-enter it at the end of the OLD List (not the New List). So tasks remain in the Old List until they are finished.</p>
<p>7. When you have done as much work in the Old List as you want to do for the time being, you switch to the New List.</p>
<p>8. The rules for processing tasks in the New List are different from the rules for the Old List. In the New List you have to do the tasks in the order they are written. For example if you have ten tasks in the New List and you start by doing Task 5, you can’t then do any of Tasks 1-4. Your next task can only come from Tasks 6-10. Unfinished tasks in the New List are re-entered at the end of the New List, not the Old List.</p>
<p>9. Once you have reached the end of the New List, you go back to the Old List and repeat the process from Step 3 onwards.</p>
<p>10. Every time you go back to the Old List, you must work on at least one task. If you do not, every task remaining in the Old List is deleted without being re-entered.</p>
<p>11. When the Old List is empty, the New List becomes the Old List and you start a fresh New List.</p>
<p>The rules sound more complicated than they are in practice. The best way to understand them is to read them through carefully then try them out. After you’ve been doing them for a day or two, read them again to make sure that you are doing them right.</p>
<p>Here are a few suggestions on how to make the system work well for you. Please note they are only suggestions and are not part of the rules:</p>
<p>1) It’s important to keep the lists well weeded so that they contain only tasks which are still relevant. It’s a good idea to have a recurrent task “Weed Lists” in which you remove outdated tasks and those which for one reason or another you no longer wish to do.</p>
<p>2) It’s important to define what you mean by “finishing a task”. Ideally the way the task is phrased should make it clear. Compare:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Read “War and Peace”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Read “War and Peace” Chapter 10</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Read 25 pages of “War and Peace”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Read “War and Peace” for 30 minutes</p>
<p>3) If a task comes up which needs to be done immediately, write it down at the end of the New List, stop what you are doing and go straight to it. This is quite in accordance with Rules 4 and 8.</p>
<p>4) I suggest you read right through both lists before starting work each day. This is to allow your mind to get an idea of the relevant importance and urgency of what is in the list.</p>

<div>Mark, this is very interesting. I love AF4 and recommend it often to my staff. It works particularly well for those who have difficulty starting particular tasks, and difficulty making sure that all important tasks get acted on, not just the "loudest" ones.<br><br>Question: I am curious about the rule regarding rewriting acted on (but not finished) tasks to the Old List, and not the New list as in AF4. What is your thinking behind that. How will it change one's behavior,</div>

<div>Vegheadjones:<br><br><<  I am curious about the rule regarding rewriting acted on (but not finished) tasks to the Old List, and not the New list as in AF4.>><br><br>It's the key to the whole thing. On the whole the larger a task the more likely it is to be resisted.<br><br>With AF4, the most resisted tasks are usually the last ones left in the Old List. As the list grows smaller so the chance of their being worked on as the next item grows.<br><br>However once a task has been worked on in AF4 it is transferred to the New List where its chance of soon being worked on again reduces back to very low.<br><br>With this new system it stays in the Old List, where its chance of being worked on again remains high. This results in a consistent repetition of work on the task with the result it is finished much quicker than in AF4.<br><br>The new system also has an effect on the New List. Because the high-resistance tasks remain in the Old List, the New List is composed of relatively easy tasks. This means that a pass through the New List is both quicker and more comprehensive than in AF4.<br><br>In summary, in AF4 there is a tendency for the high-resistance tasks to be avoided until they really have to be done, and then for them to have a small amount of work done on them, followed by being avoided again. This can go on for a very long time.<br><br>With this new system, a high-resistance task is avoided until it really has to be done, but then it gets worked on consistently until it is completed. Once the task has been started it will be a relatively short time until it is completed.</div>

<div>Interesting, Mark. Do the AF4 rules for the new list still apply? Specifically, that you do NOT have to do anything on the new list if you have scanned it and feel no urge to do a task?</div>

<div>David Coyer:<br><br>Further to my previous answer, I was wondering how often it would happen that one wouldn't want to do at least one task from the New List. After all one only goes to the New List when you want a break from the Old List. Not doing any tasks on the New List would send you straight back to the Old List without having your break.</div>

<div>Wow, excited to try this!<br><br>Question:  do you work the New List from top down?  <br>Ie:  you have 5 items on the new list:<br>1. yard work<br>2. read article<br>3. take dog for walk<br>4. clean desk<br>5. email Bill<br><br>I decided to do #2 (read article).  I then consider 3, either do it or consider #4, either do it or consider #5?<br><br>Thanks for the new method!</div>

<div>+ JMJ +<br><br>Hmm, interesting. <br><br>I am speculating that retaining the form of AF4 (a long list with a dividing line to separate the backlog from the new items) but adding an asterisk on the unfinished item in the old list would replicate this.</div>

<div>Mark, how do you manage the two lists on paper? Where do you find the space to re-enter items in the old-list? do you use two different books that become alternatively the old and the new list? Other method?</div>

<div class="comment-meta">pkNystrom - 2013-06-14 9:51</div>
<div>I’m basically a FV user so I wonder if something similar could be done in FV.  <br><br>There were 2 sentences in Mark's blog: ” You can do the tasks in the Old List in any order you like.”  and ” When you want to stop working on a task in the Old List without finishing it, delete it and re-enter it at the end of the OLD List.”<br><br>My question is, why to delete it and re-enter a task in the Old List when you can do them in any order? Why not only to modify the task text in its original place?  (I'm not so used to automatically crossing tasks out when I've finished working on them as Mark is.)<br><br>As an example: ’Document N’ > ’Document N, 2’ > ’ Document N, X3’ > ’Document N, XX4’ > ’Document N, XXX5’> etc., and then when the line is full it would be time to rewrite the task as  for example ’OLD, Document N, 11’ to the end of the list. <br><br>In this approach the crossing out in the Old List part of the FV list would be not to tasks but to a number in the task text. The benefit I see in this approach is that the other rules Mark wrote in this blog could be used in FV also. What do you think?</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">pkNystrom - 2013-06-14 11:07</div>
<div>Some afterthougthts to explain why I have found it is sometimes beneficial to modify the item text instead of rewriting the item to the end. <br><br>As Mark wrote rewriting the item to the end of the (FV) list makes it ’disappear’ compared to if it is kept in it’s 'original' place.  It is also difficult to see which tasks are in progress unless there is a number (or some other visual cue) to highlight it. I don’t expect myself to remember on Monday what I worked with last week.<br><br>The problem created is that the same item is selected multiple time so the plain ’dot an item’ does not work as the only approach. <br><br>When I work in FV mode I add items to the list: ’FV chain: items 34, 57, 166,167’, ’FV: items 34, 57, 175’ so that it’s easier to find the items. It makes it also easy to select the same items multiple times neatly.  The drawback is that items need numbers or some other way how to identify them. The question whether the benefits of row numbering are bigger than the drawbacks depends on how much cross referencing is needed. I use the same numbers to cross-refer the items also to projects so they work fine for me.<br><br>Higher resistance task need some highlighting. Mark’s version is ok but this the current variant is AF4 dependent. Somehow, I hope it’s not his  last word. As a FV user.</div>

When enough has been done on the item simply draw a small horizontal line through the upper part to form a small cross symbol. I have been doing this with another notes based system to indicate which page I am currently working on. This is very easy to see and gives good feedback on the number of 'reps' an item has been worked on. (This coding format could also be used in the new list for recurring items).</div>

<div>Sorry, I don't think I made my last point very clear. Here is an example: <br><br>1. Item not yet selected to work on: 'Inbox zero'<br><br>2. Item selected to work on: 'Inbox zero' l<br><br>3: Item worked on enough for now: 'Inbox zero' + <br><br>4: Item has been worked on several times and is currently being worked on: + + + + + l<br><br>etc. just wondering if this would prevent the need for 2 long lists?</div>

There are plenty of alternative solutions, such as having one list starting at one end of a notebook, and the other at the other (turn the notebook upside down). Or one at the beginning and one half-way through. Or one using the left hand pages and the other the right. Or having two columns on one page. Or just using sheets of paper rather than a notebook. Or starting a new page each time you need to in a notebook and heading the page OLD or NEW.</div>

<div>Mark, this looks outstanding. Here's one way to use it for managing your personal and professional life seperately, in one notebook.<br><br>1. Label the top first page of a 5 x 8 spiral-top writing pad with "Old Tasks: Personal".<br><br>2. Write down all your existing personal tasks along the left half of the page.<br><br>3. Write "New Tasks: Personal" on the first new page.<br><br>4. Flip the notebook over and label the top first page with "Old Tasks: Professional".<br><br>5. Write down all your existing professional tasks along the left half of the page.<br><br>6. Write "New Tasks: Professional" on the first new page.<br><br>7. Bind the front and back cover together (rubber band/tape/glue). This gives you a stiff writing surface, ensures quick flipping to your personal or professional section, and rids you of the tacky front covers of most spiral notepads. Or just rip the front cover off.<br><br>8. Cut the bottom right corners off the "old tasks" pages. Now, you can easily flip to your new tasks.<br><br>9. Need to rewrite an unfinished old task? Jot it on the right half of any "old tasks" page.</div>

<div>Tried the new hack today and was happy with results. This could potentially replace my tried and tested DIT approach. <br><br>Clarification on Items 1-4 on the New List, if I start on 5, and then I have to do 6-10, when will I get to 1-4. Not sure I am clear on that. <br><br>Also, there are items on the Old List that are long-term/waiting items that I want to skip reviewing when I look at the list, but I still scan them all the time. Looks like wasted effort, Right? <br><br>But overall getting some good results and hoping you won't introduce another method this week, <br><br>Kevin</div>

<div>This looks really good. I've been trying ASEM with AF4R. This will be similar, but much easier. Love the simple, but genius, idea of keeping unfinished "old" tasks in that list. As Mark said in an earlier reply, that is the key. Rather than calling it the "old" list, I use "now." So will have a now list, which is closed, and new, open list. Think I'll still use ASEM to process the "now" list.</div>

Not sure I am clear on that. >><br><br>I think you might be misunderstanding Rule 8. With the New List, you get one pass through it in which you can do as many or as few tasks as you like, but only in the order in which they are written on the list. When you've finished the pass, you go back to the Old List where you can stay as long as you like, and do tasks in whatever order you like.

<div>Hello Mark,<br><br>This looks very interesting!  I tried AF4 and AF4-3T last year and liked them a lot, but they have disadvantages, which have already been written about so I won't repeat them here.  I'm going to try out this new version at work from Monday, but a have a few questions:<br>1. In contrast to the original AF4 in rule 10 you state that if one does nothing during a visit to the Old List all remaining tasks must be DELETED not DISMISSED for future review.  Why did you decide to drop the dismissal process?<br>2. Related to the question above, do you think that the system would also work with dismissal instead of deletion?  I found that a good feature of the AF systems - a useful "someday/maybe" list.<br>3. In my home life I have several recurring, daily tasks such as exercise, taking medicine, doing a language lesson and journal writing.  I'm not sure that this new system would deal with these items effectively or am I underestimating it?  What has your experience been?<br><br>Thanks again for the new system!</div>

<div>Regarding the question why you would want to switch to the New List without doing anything on it (and, in that case, not even getting a break from your work on the Old List):<br><br>I could see a scenario where I have a New List that's a few days old, because I haven't cleared the Old List yet. While working the Old List I might become anxious if there isn't anything urgent in the New List that I should be doing today, so I stop working on the Old List and switch to the New List. I could decide that the 'urgent' items in the New List aren't as important as what I was working on in the Old List, so I switch back to the Old List. All perfectly within the rules.<br><br>BTW, Mark, one of the brilliant features of all your systems is that it's relatively painless to switch between them. Recently I've mainly used DIT, with quite good results, but I could see how this new system would be even more effective. I'm using a digital implementation with labels 'yesterday', 'today above the line', 'today below the line', and 'tomorrow' (actually my labels are much shorter, but you get the idea). The only modification I would need to make for this new system is to add a label 'yesterday-new', and then everything with label 'yesterday' would be my Old List, and everything else except stuff labeled 'tomorrow' is the New List. This way I could have my choice of stuff to work on from the New List being guided by DIT-principles. What I especially like about DIT is the idea of "a day's work", that notion would remain intact if I implement your new system as described above.</div>

The reason boils down to the fact that AF4 is usually done in a notebook, so it's easy to keep dismissed tasks available in the finished lists. Whereas this system is, by me at least, done in a loose-leaf folder and I really want to be able to throw the old pages away.

I have exercise, taking medicine and doing a language lesson to do myself, and I guess that answering blog comments sort of equates to the journal. So far the medicine, language lesson and replying to comments have worked fine. The medicine I do on a fixed time basis so it's not in the list, but the other two are. <br><br>That leaves exercise. I enjoy it when I'm doing it, but I experience a lot of resistance to starting it. I think it is best done at a fixed time each day, preferably first thing in the morning.

<div>I'll vote for keeping the long projects in the same order and adding marks as I work on them, rather than rewriting them at the end. If I see Project A first, I'm more likely to do it than the others. It will get done. If I see Project B first, I'm more likely to do it, and A moves to the back-burner. Next time, C gets the attention. I'd rather work on A more often and finish it faster than divide my time between them. The effect is more noticeable with longer projects with fuzzier deadlines. Ages ago there was a discussion about how often to rotate tasks. Doing AAABBBCCC gets A done in 3 hours, then B, then C. Doing ABCABCABC finishes nothing until the 7th hour.<br><br>It's nice to be able to work on B if we can't work on A (even if "can't" means bored with), but keeping the focus on A will get a feeling of accomplishment sooner.<br><br>I like "do in order" as a guideline, but not a rule. If I should do 5 now, that means I can't do 4 as a reward.</div>

<div>Interesting comparison to SF.   But I think the dynamics of "The Ultimate" are much different, not ever forcing you to do something you can't or don't want to do.   I got bogged down with SF because I had to iterate on the Second Column items multiple times before I could get to the newest items at the end of the list.   Thus I'd add more and more urgent items to the Second Column for immediate attention.   This bogged down the whole mechanism since the Second Column works best when there are only a very few items there.</div>

<div>Hi Mark,<br><br>I have the following situation on my old list for personal stuff.  I now have a handful of tasks that now cannot be done because they are dependent other things happening first.  For example, I had "setup recording of X program on DVR".  But I have encountered a problem with our digital cable and now have to call the provider for a service call.  So what do I do with tasks that are on my old list, but now cannot be done due to other dependencies?  And importantly, if these are all that is left on my old list.</div>

<div>Double Nevermind. It is like Superfocus as I described. That is, unfinished tasks  from the Old list can be rewritten in the New list.

If 1, then the Old list grows , but with smaller and smaller tasks, eventually pushing everything in the list to completion or elimination.  Which makes me relate it to the acting like Column 2 of Superfocus. Almost exactly, except with a one very long page.<br> <br>If 2, then there isn't a constant push to complete the Old list as pieces of it are simply going to the New list...which will eventually become the Old list (by Rule 11).<br><br>Does anyone follow my thought on this?

<div>Hi mark <br><br>Re: your comment above  <The new system also has an effect on the New List. Because the high-resistance tasks remain in the Old List, the New List is composed of relatively easy tasks. This means that a pass through the New List is both quicker and more comprehensive than in AF4.><br><br>Why are the tasks on the new list relatively easy?  I might add a new task that when I get to work on it is a ' heavy' task and therefore is re entered on the new list.  A next pass through the new list will likely make me hit this heavy item ( as it should) but doesn't necessarily mean the new list will be faster, other than it is likely in the early days to be shorter ... Or am I misinterpreting?<br><br>Also in respect of new list and e-entering a unfinnished task on the end of new list.  Is the intent to hit this re entered task during the same pass as this will now be the 'end of the list'  ( ie stuck in loop until done) or is the idea to work toward the endpoint of the list as-was before the new re entered task ?</div>

<div>Grik - After a time, the only tasks remaining on the Old List are the difficult ones.   The New List has a mix of new easy things and new difficult things.   That's why the tasks on the New List are, on average, relatively easier than the tasks on the Old List.</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Mark Forster - 2013-06-18 10:31</div>
<div>Grik:<br><br>Seraphim's answer is correct. In AF4 all the difficult tasks from the Old List get moved to the New List as soon as they have been "touched". In this system they stay in the Old List until completed. <br><br>You are correct in thinking that some new hard tasks will get entered in the New List, but they won't have built up the same charge of resistance as being new tasks they won't yet have been procrastinated over.</div>

<div>About this last question by CarstenN/Grik: I think they refer to the phenomenon of "chasing the end of the list" that could be so prominent in AF1 and other AF-incarnations. It still could happen in this system, but not nearly as extensive because you're not allowed to go back in the New List. You could do something from the New List, not finish it and rewrite at the end, do another task, do the rewritten task at the end again and rewrite at the end, but after that you would effectively stay with the same task.</div>

<div>It was pretty easy to modify my setup in Outlook to implement TUTMS? at work, so I went ahead and did it, and am trying it out.<br><br>But as to Nicole's point, I'm already chasing the end of the New List, LOL!    It so happens that I've had some pressing family issues to deal with, so my bandwidth at work has been curtailed.   And I can only focus on the most urgent tasks right now.   They keep piling up at the end of the New List, and I keep working through them, never getting to the end.<br><br>Right now, I can see that it is clearly a short-term problem, and I hope it will resolve itself soon.   But since I also have a tendency to over-commit, I see a possible risk here, of always chasing the end of the New List and rarely making visits to the Old List.   I'm not sure how the mechanics of the system would flag this as an issue (like DIT does).   <br><br>Obviously, I could still apply the same corrective (audit my commitments) - the issue is that there is no automatic trigger for that, and no systemic, ongoing way to clearly measure one's overall level of commitment, like DIT does.<br><br>I'm still going to try this for a while and see if it becomes a serious issue.   There is something very appealing about the fact that the Old List is a standard "closed list" that makes me want to try this.</div>

<div>Regarding rule #3 and #10:<br>3. Start working on the tasks in the Old List. <br>10. Every time you go back to the Old List, you must work on at least one task. If you do not, every task remaining in the Old List is deleted without being re-entered.<br><br>I wonder if there is any significant drawback, if you would START first in the new list?<br><br>IMHO to start in the new list would be more flexible. <br>Example1: Before lunch you have an idea or task which you will get into directly after lunch.<br>Example2: Before leaving the office you rembered that you forgot to do a system backup which take quite a while. You decide to do it first if you enter the treadmill the next day.<br><br>If you follow the rules #3,#10 strictly you can't enter the task to your new list, because if you enter the task and do it after lunch (Example1) you would have to delete the remaining old list (in theory ;-)<br><br>If you allow to start with the new list you can park your "after-lunch-task" on the new list. You don't have to park it elsewhere (calendar, post-it, etc). I only see the disadvantage, that the task on the old list have to stay in the waitingroom a little longer (but as we know from our visits at the MD - this is annoying, but in the end you will be "processed" - mostly).</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Mark Forster - 2013-06-19 11:50</div>
<div>Jens:<br><br>I think you are misunderstanding the instructions. When Rule 3 says "start working on the Old List" that is how you start off at the beginning of your use of the method, i.e. immediately after you have constructed your first list. At that stage there is only the one list. There is no New List. It's also what happens when you reach the end of the New List after each reiteration of the system.<br><br>It does not mean that you start again with the Old List after each time you take a break. After a break you just continue from where you left off. <br><br>If something urgent comes up you can process it in accordance with Suggestion 3, which reads: "If a task comes up which needs to be done immediately, write it down at the end of the New List, stop what you are doing and go straight to it. This is quite in accordance with Rules 4 and 8."</div>

<div>I am actually looking forward to closing the old list.  It will feel like I have completed a milestone and can now move on to a new chapter.  <br><br>I have also completed today a small item (check if Doctor X bill were paid).  This item never were urgent or important enough to complete. But it was just hanging around on my to do list causing emotional overhead and noise.  Like a dripping faucet.

Is there some way to use the existing rules and get an objective "flag" like this?    Or is there a simple tweak that would give you that flag?   Those are the questions I am thinking about.<br><br>Without an objective flag, I start getting anxious as soon as I spend "too much time" away from the Old List, wondering whether I've got myself overcommitted again.   Depending on my mood, "too much time" can mean a couple hours or a couple days.   I need an objective indicator that doesn't depend on my mood.   :-)</div>

<div>Seraphim:<br><br>New stuff coming in faster than you can handle it IS the objective indicator that you are over committed. Having more tasks on your list at the end of the day than you had at the beginning is the exact equivalent of not being able to clear your list in DIT. So you can apply exactly the same criteria and exactly the same solution.</div>

<div>> I'm already on to the Post Ultimate TMS!<br><br>Mark, if I may ask...does that mean you've abandoned this AF4-based approach completely (because, presumably, the theory didn't pan out in practice) or that you've just tweaked it?</div>

<div>After using this system for a while, the main problem I've found with it is that there isn't a sufficient feeling of progress with the Old List. However I'm currently experimenting with a change that makes a lot of difference - though unfortunately only by sacrificing some of the flexibility with respect to extremely urgent tasks. However those tasks can always be dealt with under the rule "If it needs doing now, do it", so I am not too worried about that. On the other hand it deals extremely well with high priority tasks that don't actually need to be done right this minute.<br><br>More about this soon!</div>

<div>By soon, I hope you mean SOON. I too have found the problem you mention and was trying to come up with a hack to deal with it. After seeing your post, I will try to wait. :)</div>

<div>I'm curious about a set-up issue. Do you carry around one notebook with the list and a second, separate notebook for taking notes? Or does everything go into one notebook? I'm very interested in trying this out, but I tend to take a lot of notes during the day and am not loving the idea of commingling notes/tasks or carrying around two notebooks. How do you handle this?</div>

<div>Mike:<br><br>My list remains on my desk, static, and doesn't travel with me. It's not a notebook but a loose-leaf binder with lined A4 sheets.<br><br>When out-and-about I write notes on unlined record cards which I then scan into my Doxie scanner at the earliest opportunity. I often take the scanner with me to meetings. It all then goes straight into Evernote.<br><br>It's a matter of finding what works for you.</div>

<div>Seeing as you're talking about set-up, I'm in a personal debate, which to use as a note taking method? The camp is divided on the new TEUXDEUX pitted against ANY.DO I was using TASKPAPER for all of Marks iterations and methods. except that it doesn't deal well with tasks that really need dates assigned. Which is where Teuxdeux excels, plain lists against a simple calender, is just about perfect. <br>I tried for a while to not apply dates to tasks- by re-defining the tasks and the questions over them - but ended up in the conclusion that my definition of task was askew. A task 'starts at the start - is worked on - & is finished when finished' is my current reckoning, so as soon as I need to apply a date to anything in my TUTMS, it's ripped off the list into the calender. It's my way of acknowledging a commitment over a goal/task (and gets me through lists faster!). <br>But then Any.do has its "moment" feature and a nice way to maintain lists *and* a schedule with the same task set! <br>both let me do a dictation to generate a new task, which as a farmer, is my best input method (dont ask what my hands are covered in!:) I input my task into 'today' (the quickest entry) and then shift them to my new list the next morning with the any.do 'moment' - its amazing how often what i thought was a task, wasn't. A few hours to vet the consequences and definition of tasks is gaining importance with me!  <br>Thanks to Mark for your work in this field. I struggled for such a long time to discipline to any old "priority" markers, it so regularly does not apply when I'm working *with and in* the fickle outdoors environment - 'humble-me' assigning priorites on nature? (laughs!) <br>All of these methods have been far superior in managing not only myself, but my other labour resources too!  <br>Is anyone able to offer a opinion on my two options?</div>

<div>Hello Mark,<br><br>This is a French translation of the rules — Enjoy!<br><br>Many thanks for everything you have been inventing, testing, posting and improving for years.<br><br>Best regards,<br><br>Lionel<br><br>__<br><br>Principes :<br><br>1. Des tâches à écrire et à accomplir, au sein de deux listes : une Ancienne, une Nouvelle ;<br><br>2. Gardez vide la Nouvelle liste. L'Ancienne, elle, accueille tout ce que vous comptez accomplir dans les deux semaines ;<br><br>3. Au sein de l'Ancienne, commencez à réaliser les tâches. Cette liste reste telle qu'elle est : c'est la Nouvelle — et elle seule — qui accueille vos nouvelles idées de tâches ;<br><br>4. Les tâches de l'Ancienne se réalisent librement, dans l'ordre et selon la durée que vous désirez ;<br><br>5. Quand vous en terminez une, retirez-la (effacez-la) de l'Ancienne. Si elle a vocation à être récurrente, ré-inscrivez-la dans la Nouvelle, à la toute fin ;<br><br>6. Terminez une tâche ou réalisez-la partiellement. Dans ce cas, effacez-la et c'est à la fin de l'Ancienne que vous la ré-inscrivez. Ainsi l'Ancienne sert-elle pleinement à stocker des choses en cours ;<br><br>7. Quant vous atteignez le maximum de ce que vous pouvez ou souhaitez faire — dans le délai des deux semaines (cf. point 2) —, passez à la Nouvelle ;<br><br>8. Accomplir les tâches de la Nouvelle se fait différemment : choisissez une tâche quelconque, puis allez exclusivement vers le bas (par ex., si vous entamez la numéro 4/10, accomplissez ensuite la 5 et la 6, jusqu'à 10). Certaines, même avec vos efforts, demeurent ? Ré-inscrivez-les à la fin de cette même liste ;<br><br>9. Quand vous terminez la Nouvelle, retournez à l'Ancienne et faites les choses normalement, en effaçant ce qui est à son terme, en ré-introduisant à la fin ce qui a encore besoin de travail, en inscrivant le récurrent dans la Nouvelle, à la toute fin (point 3 et suivants) ;<br><br>10. Toutes les fois que vous retournez à l'Ancienne (point 9), imposez-vous d'accomplir une tâche ou plus. Si c'est trop dur et s'il en reste, effacez ce qui vous résiste ;<br><br>11. Quand vous terminez l'Ancienne, la Nouvelle prend sa place et devient officiellement l'Ancienne. Commencez une Nouvelle toute neuve (vide, cf. point 2).<br><br>Là, vous consultez les principes à l'écrit. Dans la pratique, ils sont plus simples. Intégrer leur fonctionnement ? Simplement lire, en se concentrant. Et appliquer. Après un ou deux jours de pratique, relisez les règles, pour être sûr que tout est bon.</div>

<div>Mark,<br><br>When you came up with the idea for this modification to AF4, did you consider using the same modification with any of your other systems?  Why did you choose AF4?  Do you think it might work well with any of the others?<br><br>Thanks,<br>Austin</div>

<div>@Lionel : Point 8 is translated wrong.<br><br>8. Accomplir les tâches de la Nouvelle se fait différemment : choisissez une tâche quelconque, puis allez exclusivement vers le bas (par ex., si vous commencez par la numéro 4/10, votre prochaine tâche ne peut être que l'une des tâches de 5 à 10, pas les tâches de 1 à 3). Certaines, même avec vos efforts, demeurent ? Ré-inscrivez-les à la fin de cette même liste ;</div>

<div>This is really insightful in terms of prioritizing tasks. I find that a fun visual planner helps me organize my activities which really helps me get things done. After applying the tips and tricks you mentioned above, I put them in my Owaves planner (www.owaves.com) which helps keep me focused throughout the day.</div>
