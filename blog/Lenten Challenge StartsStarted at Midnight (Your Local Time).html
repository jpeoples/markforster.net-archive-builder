<h1>Lenten Challenge Starts/Started at Midnight (Your Local Time)</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2019-03-5 18:41</div>
<div class="content"><p>Here is the starting list for the <strong>Lenten Challenge 2019</strong>. I will accept last minute entries and amendments up to 11.59pm March 5th (your local time). </p>
<p>At the very last moment I decided to change my own entry to a new, and so far untried, no-list method. I have no idea whether I’ll be able to keep it going.</p>
<p>I’m pleased to say that we have 57 entrants, which I think is a record for this.</p>
<p>If you fail to keep to the challenge please let us know in the comments to this post so that everyone can see. Do include a description of your experiences if you want to. Progress reports are also welcome.</p>
<p>If you are unable to post, then you can email me (top right tab) but please only do this if you have to.</p>
<p>Remember this is a challenge and not a competition, so the only person you will be deceiving if you cheat is yourself! </p>

<div>I'm no. 9 on the above list and have been doing simple scanning for a couple of weeks so that's the system I'll take into the challenge.</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Chris Cooper - 2019-03-5 22:08</div>
<div>I'll take the challenge using RAF (Real Autofocus), with the tweak of processing Day(s) Before Yesterday using FV rules rather than doing tasks in strict order. That makes slightly less of a demand on my willpower muscle.<br><br>——<br><br>As far as I can see, the method of processing Yesterday + Today is left open by the rules of RAF. I specify it in this way: <br><br>– On my first pass through the Yesterday + Today list, I use simple scanning. One of the tasks I write in today's list is DBY (meaning move to Day[s] Before Yesterday). <br><br>– When I return to the Yesterday + Today list, I use FVP.<br><br>Looks  a bit rococo when written out. I've been fiddling with rules for days.</div>

<div>Alan Baljeu: <br><br>I think 'halving' comes from Mark's first book. Write down everything you have to do, and divide it in half over and over again until you have only one thing left, and then you do it. A multiple pass system. In the book, Mark describes starting with two categories of work that have about the same amount of work to be done. <br><br>Terribly useful idea when whittling down a big backlog of paper: divide the pile into halves, then divide the halves into halves, etc till the problem is sufficiently chunked down.<br><br>In Serial No-list, which I'm also doing, I guess you would write down everything, then divide that list in two, then pick a half and divide that in two, to eventually whittle your way down to the next task. But that's a lot of judging, weighing, thinking, etc and less intuitive.<br><br>This is my interpretation of halving; not sure what our Lenten colleague's idea of using it would look like.</div>

<div>@Chris<br><br> It is in the Real Autofocus? post, actually near your comment. Your system helped me find it. I was searching for the words Yesterday, Day before Yesterday and Things, to no avail.</div>

<div>Alan Baljeu:<br><br><< I think 'halving' comes from Mark's first book. >><br><br>Yes, though the implementation of it is different from what you suggest. It's the system to be found here which is based on the halving principle - though I didn't actually give the system that name at the time:<br><br><a href="../blog/Another Simple and Effective Method.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2013/5/20/another-simple-and-effective-method.html</a></div>

<div>I hate to say this, but I've crashed out already. I should really know better by now than to change to an untried system at the last minute. The 10-Task No-List system failed when some unexpected and time-consuming circumstances came up today.<br><br>Anyway I am now going back to The Bounce in the hope that I can keep it going through the period of the Challenge - even though I'm no longer part of it!</div>

<div>Mark, I think you should have special dispensation to recommence the challenge with the Bounce.  <br><br>Or maybe that's the start of a slippery slope and you wouldn't agree to bending the rules to your own advantage. <br><br>Good luck to everyone!</div>

<div>A busy first day with pre-established plans and my job precludes me from following my system during the day, but I have a methodology for my work tasks that I followed to the letter (it is another gamified system with a reward system in place, but when at work there is an order in which I need to do things in order to keep to my deadlines, and I generally do prefer to be seen to be working!).<br><br>When I did get back in the evening I opened up my spreadsheet and it told me to stop for the night, so I ticked off the things I had done just as matter of course through the day and tucked in earlier than I would usually.<br><br>I have a bit more time in the flat tonight, and the expectation is that my system will get me focused on my chores and out for a run before it even thinks of letting me treat myself (with one non-repeating task to cross off in the interim). It is a harsh master, but ultimately I feel it is fair. We shall see how I feel a few more days down the line.<br><br>Days completed: 1.<br>Tasks done: "only" 4.<br>Rewards claimed: 0.</div>

<div>I am super interested to learn more about your system Eiron.<br><br>Overall I was very happy with the official Day 1 with the Bouce. I had a few time sensitive work I needed to produce and had two surprises come up. The Bounce got me through those plus I got a many little things done in-between them, they mostly came as I was bouncing up and looking for something to “rebound” me back down.  <br><br>Today I have some even tighter deadline work due and many more meetings. Looking forward to see how the Bounce handles it all.</div>

<div>As predicted, my system had me vacuuming, mopping, cleaning windows and mirrors and cleaning the tumble drier filter. An exciting evening all round. I had to have an emergency finance meeting with my brother, so that took some of the time out of my evening, but I am not dissatisfied with my progress. Technically, all that cleaning I did was two things off my grid (they could be more granular, but I had 'daily cleaning tasks' as the item, so despite them being pretty big jobs (each involving a few sub-tasks that I have not enumerated), that changes things as follows:<br><br>Days completed: 2.<br>Tasks done: 6; 3.0 per day on average.<br>Rewards claimed: 0.<br><br>My evening and weekend are both freer, so hopefully we should see a bit of a jump to these numbers (maybe including a reward or two!).</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Eiron Page - 2019-03-8 12:19</div>
<div>Vegheadjones: My system is a spreadsheet with code I have built into it in order to automatically fill a 5x5 'Bingo' card with jobs on it. It uses semi-randomised weightings to prioritise the important tasks, while still making sure that less critical tasks and things that I want to do for myself still make an appearance.<br><br>I can choose how to tick off the tasks on this card, in any order I like, but the main rule is I am only allowed to claim a 'Reward' from the grid if I have cleared the other jobs in that line first. It means that I feel I am earning my treats rather than using them as a means to procrastinate, and it works out well for me this way (even if I do not get to claim them, I still feel this is fair).<br><br>On alternate evenings I do one of two things: either fill the gaps in the grid using the same algorithm and then shuffle the location of the cells, or completely clear and refill the grid. This makes sure it stays current.<br><br>If a task is literally impossible at the current time (and the reason has to be valid, e.g. financial constraint, timing [such as going to the Post Office on a Sunday when it is closed]) and there is no way it could be completed before a grid refresh, only then am I allowed to check it off without completing it. The rule then is I have to run the refill-shuffle process.<br><br>It is just the right combination of freedom/constraint/reward for me to push forward with what absolutely needs doing, while also getting some of those "nice to do" and "just for me" things done in the process. From my previous comments, you can see that if something absolutely needs doing now, then I allow myself to do that. The system is used as a driver for when I am wondering "what next?" (which with my decision paralysis is most always).<br><br>It all sounds a little complicated, but I have been building and tweaking the system for the best part of a year and most of it is automated now. I have banned myself from making changes during this challenge, so anything that does not work I shall make a note of and address at its conclusion.</div>

<div>I'm out.<br><br>It always seems to break down the same way:<br><br>I use Trello at work, so it feels pointless to use a second list there. I don't have the flexibility to choose my own tasks at work, anyway.<br><br>And then I'm so exhausted by the time I get home that the last thing I want to do is look at another list, even if it contains nothing but fun or relaxing stuff. My mind just wants to turn off.</div>

<div class="comment-meta">vegheadjones - 2019-03-8 18:25</div>
<div>thanks Eiron, once upon a time I set up an excel spreadsheet with VBA code to identify what I should be working on right now. It factored in due dates, importance, priority, project linkage and a DWM expiration date. After working on it for so long, I realized that my intuition when using a catch-all list was just as good, so I abandoned it.<br><br>The bingo idea is really intriguing, glad it works for you</div>

<div>I have been using Simple Scanning with a notebook, and unfortunately I left my notebook at home yesterday, so had to work via a No List system for the day (which was refreshing for keeping me on the top priorities, but not so good for keeping track of outstanding commitments), I guess this means I have flunked the challenge!  <br><br>Mark, could you remind me of the benefit of sticking to a single system for (as much as possible of) the period?  Is it so that, through sustaining a commitment, we work through limitations in our working patterns and get the system working properly, rather than blaming the system and changing around?</div>

<div>I have to ask: I couldn't improve "Task Tracking Lite/Light" enough to be like vanilla "Task Tracking 2.0" so I went back to the latter on the Saturday after Ash Wednesday, and have been using it ever since.  Am I still on the challenge?</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Sitkeys - 2019-03-24 8:09</div>
<div>I started with an own system which I call Random No List (although Random Hammer, as in <a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2016/4/12/no-list-types-i-the-hamm=er.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2016/4/12/no-list-types-i-the-hamm=er.html</a> , would probably be more precise but it sounds a bit harsh to me). There is no sliding involved. If I throw a four, I'll do the fourth uncrossed task. If there are less than four open items, I add a new one. At the end of the day, I don't add any new tasks so I feel I can get the list done. A six-sided die works great but depending on the day I sometimes use another number. Tasks which are actioned but not finished are reentered but I find myself not doing that very often. With this system, I usually finish a task or at least rewrite it in a different way every time I did some work on it. For the first entry of a day, I like one to four tasks as well as building the list up by rolling the die.<br><br>Every time I used a system during lent, it was the Random No List. I just didn't use it nearly every day, which works alright because it is a No List. Still, it would have gained much more traction if I used it every day, so I consider myself off the challenge but happily using the system onwards because it works just great for me to 1. get a feeling for what is significant in this moment and 2. do it with no resistance at all. Of course, with a randomizer, you sometimes have to use common sense (getting dressed after an event because doing the dishes and other stuff were chosen first is probably not an option) but you can limit that by deciding to not add any new tasks at any point before rolling the die. Then, eventually, every task on the list will be actioned.</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Eiron Page - 2019-04-5 9:23</div>
<div>I made a small change to my system to allow myself to tick off to-dos when my computer is not available. If this change invalidates the challenge, then I am out. I stopped doing a counter when the comments were unavailable for a few days early on (and when the task 'fix my computer' came up and became my sole focus for about a week), so I do not have a measure of how things went.<br><br>Still, I am using the same system and with better results than before, so maybe moving slightly away from the original specs was a good thing!</div>

<div>Hi Mark, I'm using Serial No-List for the challenge, and I've been enjoying the comments of Seraphim and others on how they're doing.<br><br>I really like the system's low overhead and have been using it consistently (in the sense that I haven't been at all tempted to try another system). However, I haven't been using it all day every day, but then maybe that's still within the rules - it seems so when I've read about Seraphim's (and others') experiences with the system but please correct me if I'm wrong.  Maybe I've already failed!<br><br>Some days I write down every new task before I do it, when I want to reassure myself that I'm makiing good use of my time. What I don't like about this is that it makes the day's list longer and therefore more cumbersome.<br><br>Other days I work through several tasks in a row as Ithey come to my attention, without writing them down, and only write down tasks I'm afraid I might forget.  This keeps the list cleaner.</div>

<div>I'm out of the challenge. I was Simple Scanning, but the list got too big and unwieldy and I lost momentum. I'm going to try a different method for the remainder of Lent</div>

<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">MrBacklog - 2019-04-10 17:29</div>
<div>I'm out - so close but so far!<br><br>The method started out as:<br>Split tasks into 3 priority piles, then simple scanning through each pile. Batch similar tasks for efficiency. <br><br>But I ended up simply batching tasks and then working though them completely one batch at a time. I have dropped priority of tasks, other than moving tasks into one batch that I want to do each day (e.g. client emails). I always manage to clear that by lunchtime.<br>I suppose it is a significant enough change to mean I'm out.<br><br>I'm liking what I'm doing at the moment as it is stupidly simple and I get a lot of traction doing similar type tasks all in one go each afternoon. I seem to get on a roll so that is good.</div>

<div>Margaret1 - <br><br><< However, I haven't been using it all day every day, but then maybe that's still within the rules >><br><br>The rules ( <a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2730943#post2732758" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2730943#post2732758</a> ) don't specifically say whether or not to use it all day every day. But there are a few reasons why I don't think that's the best way to work, or indeed, that it is even logically possible:<br><br>- I don't think it's possible to use a TM system for every task, because "every task" is an ambiguous, indefinable concept. Every letter I type here is an "action" -- but is it a task?  Every task or action can be broken down into smaller ones. But just because we CAN break them down, and write them down, doesn't mean it's feasible or useful. But this implies that every task assumes the smaller, component asks are implicitly understood to the degree that there is no need to specify them -- no need to write them down. This means there are all kinds of things we never write down, and would never have any rational reason for writing down.<br><br>- Then there are habits. Every time I brush my teeth, it's a "task" - so should I write it down on my list when I get up in the morning? I suppose if one needs a reminder, and wants to make oneself more consciously aware, then maybe it's helpful. But once the habit is established, it just isn't needed anymore. Just get up and follow the morning habitual routine.<br><br>- I feel that a TM system should be a help and a guide to one's intuition, and should not take the place of it. So I try just to do whatever is in front of me, without reference to a list, unless I know I will need the help of the list, or I start feeling aimless. I think it's a *good* thing to use a good system to teach you good habits, so that you don't need the system anymore -- or at least don't need it for the smaller tasks.<br><br>With Serial No-List, it's easy to let this ebb and flow as needed. Whenever I am feeling I am in a good flow state without the list, then I just try to keep it going. Sometimes it's fine just to follow my calendar most of the day, and catch up on whatever small things come to mind in between the meetings.<br><br>But whenever I feel I need more guidance and focus, I just write more on my list -- more often, more detail, smaller tasks. And then the focus comes back.<br><br>And in general, I just start the day by writing down whatever is on my mind. I think the human mind is a great tool for capturing the right stuff at the right level of specification. And if we don't get it quite right, we can make it a little more detailed, or a little less detailed, and see what works better.<br><br>It would be interesting to hear Mark's perspective on this!</div>

<div>I'm still "in," which is remarkable since I don't think I have ever stayed so long with one system, although I'm tempted to try the serial no-list system you guys have been talking about. It looks like I am the only person on Mark's list using Time surfing, a system based largely on using intuition to guide choices in the moment. I have tried other versions of Mark's no list systems, but they didn't really work for me -- missed tasks and added stress. But this approach feels very different, I have not used a list at all since February. <br>- Some observations: From the perspective of procrastination or that feeling resistance, Time Surfing has the same feel for me as the randomizer. The only difference is that I'm happier with the choices that I'm making.  I also feel, during the day, much more "in the moment" with things, I sleep better, and I have less stress (and this is one of my busiest times). For me, it's a bit like trusting the GPS on my phone or watch to take me through unfamiliar territory --  I have no idea the route, but I know the device will ding me in plenty of time to make the correct turn. And suddenly I'm home! Intuition is the "ding" and has been far more reliable than my intellect at choosing the correct task in the moment.</div>

<div>Thanks for your reply Seraphim - very interesting and helpful, as usual.  It's reassured me that I'm not breaking any rules, therefore I'm still officially in the challenge.  <br><br>Using the list has helped me to identify and work on the essential tasks without having to plough through multiple tasks that aren't relevant today.  I have a daily task "once through whole list" so that I can reassure myself I'm not going to forget something important. If I spot something I want to work on today I add it to today's list.  In practice this means that I don't even have to go right through the whole list - just checking the last few days is fine.  Of course once I've worked on today's page for as long as I need to, the rules get me to go backwards through the previous days' lists anyway.  <br><br>I occasionally have times when I don't want to do ANY tasks on the list, even though they should be worked on - this bunking off makes me feel guilty, but I don't think it breaks the challenge, if the challenge is to use only one system.  If the challenge is to not bunk off when I should be doing tasks from my list then I'd have been out long ago.  Of course I could always add a task "feel free to bunk off" to my list!</div>

<div>Margaret1 - <br><br><< Of course I could always add a task "feel free to bunk off" to my list! >><br><br>Actually, maybe "feel free to bunk off" should just be part of the official rules!  :-)<br><br>As I wrote to Alan earlier ( <a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2737722#post2738252" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2737722#post2738252</a> ), I want the system to preserve complete freedom of action at all times. The system is a guide to help me sort out what my intuition and internal motivations are already telling me. But I don't want the rules to dictate anything to me. I am afraid it will cause me to resist the system altogether, in the long run, if there are any obligatory rules that try to force me to behave in a certain way.<br><br>So if I am sick of my work and sick of writing things down, and I just want to get away for awhile, I want the system to allow me to do that without making me "sort it out", and without making me feel guilty about it!<br><br>But maybe, if I am afraid I am being impulsive, and want to ensure my internal motivations are not just impulsive whims, I can write "feel free to bunk off" on the list before selecting it. This acknowledges my current state of mind but gives me a moment to reflect before just going off on a whim.<br><br>This seems in line with how Mark has recommended similar things, as far back as AF1 at least.</div>

<div>I'd just put "bunk off" and see whether it stood out.<br><br>It would be interesting to see how often it recurred.</div>

<div>So I originally posted that i would use the ASEM system for the challenge and that is what I did for the entire time during the 40 days....that is,  whenever I followed a systematic approach to managing my time.  However, there were many times that I "bunked off" and did not follow any system whatsoever.  So, perhaps the trial was not successful for me. <br><br>My observations of ASEM is that I liked the system for the most part, until I became fatigued.  <br><br>There were also times when I really disliked ASEM ...especially whenever my options were down to doing some tasks for which I had high resistance.  <br><br>I also found that the effectiveness of ASEM was diminished whenever I had a large number of tasks to do.  So, it paid to be very discriminating when deciding to add another task and keep it to a short list.<br><br>Overall, I found ASEM to be a good system that i kept returning to every day.  But, to try to use it every waking minute was not possible for me, and I still struggled with resistance.</div>

<div>I completed the challenge, there are a few simple changes I am going to make so simple scanning suits me better, colour coding mainly, but am very happy with this system.<br>Thanks Mark</div>

<div>I completed the challenge, though it took me until near the end to remember the challenge was not switching systems. Then again, I pretty much always use something like simple scanning and autofocus whether it's on paper, note app, or in this case, Dalo[0].<br><br>I started using Dalo at the beginning of this year after having seen it previously mentioned in a comment on this site. Dalo provides a nice, dedicated app experience for Mac and iOS. There are two contexts: home and work. You enter tasks, and select them for focus. There is a context-specific view for your selected tasks. My personal failing is not completing tasks when they are completed -- it usually happens the morning of the next day, so I need to restart my end-of-day review.<br><br>I made a number of recommendations, including allowing people donate to support future development, and the dev just implemented hiding completed tasks.  This release actually stopped me from looking for a replacement app, which had started on Saturday :). I was leaning towards MS To-Do, but there's no import feature.  The backup is OmniFocus, but it's an expensive and bloated beast (IMO), though I may still try it.<br><br>[0] https://www.nishcoapps.com</div>

<div>Was mostly successful and consistent w/AF4 Revised...really loved the system, and even used the New, Recurring, Unfinished to structure my grocery list.</div>

<div>I'm still using Serial No-List, but now that the Lenten challenge is over I'm planning to use a few tweaks to customise it. I was already using a few minor notation marks during the challenge (e.g. putting brackets round an item that was awaiting a response from someone else, using block capitals for an item that was a must-do-today).  <br><br>I want to find a way to keep must-do today tasks easily distinguishable from tasks that can be done anytime in the next few days and from tasks that fall into the someday/maybe category (of which I can generate quite a few during one day!). This means I have to categorise each task as I think of it, but that's easy. <br><br>I'll draw a vertical line down the middle of each page so that I have four columns per day open to view. The first column will be for must-do-today tasks (top down) and for daily routine tasks (bottom up) (although most of the time I just do those from memory without having to write them down),the second column for tasks to be done sometime in the next few days,<br>the third column for project tasks and the fourth column for someday/maybe tasks. <br><br>Following the SNL system I'll work on today's page for as long as I want, then go backwards through previous pages, either working on a task there and then, or rewriting it on today's page if it's become urgent.  Hopefully there'll be no tasks in the first column of previous pages, only undone daily routine tasks that can be ignored because they're renewed each day. <br><br>I don't know how this will work out in practice, but I think it's worth experimenting. Some columns will have only a few entries and others could have many, so it may not be practical in the sense that, where possible, I want to keep to only using one new page per day.   <br><br>The thing I like most about SNL is that each day is a fresh start.</div>

<div>Margaret1 - <br><br>I tried something like that sometime back, for a week or two. I was putting recurring / maintenance items on the right-hand page, and project work and one-off tasks on the left-hand page. I was trying to see if it helped get more focus on getting the project work and one-off tasks completed.<br><br>It seemed to help at first, but pretty quickly became a distraction:<br><br>(1) I had to decide how to categorize each task before I wrote it down. This added more and more friction to the system.<br><br>(2) It felt disorienting to go back and forth between the two pages, even though they were both open and visible. <br><br>(3) These two tensions eventually caused the distinction between the two kinds of items to blur. At this point, it was only overhead with no real value.<br><br><br>I found something else, though, that is working pretty well, and gives both a sense of focus on the big things, and a sense of completion at the end of the day, like DIT. I wrote about it here: <a href="../general_forum/Serial No-List - getting a sense of completion and closure like DIT.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2739664</a><br><br>It's very simple and doesn't create any overhead at all.<br><br>Anyway, thanks again for reporting on your progress!  Let us know how your experimenting continues to play out.</div>

<div>I count myself as having completed the Lenten challenge successfully. ("I didn't change my system. Procrastination, prevarication and resistance aren't systems.") the method I used was officially described as RAF, Modified. The tweak was that items on the old list – the day before yesterday and earlier – were processed on FV principles as the most congenial way to Delete, Defer, Do.<br><br>I sometimes seemed to need a lot of thought about which list to be in and when to switch lists. Such decisions were necessary because the "old" list grew long, as is always the case with me.<br><br>Immediately after the end of the challenge, I adopted a variant of Seraphim's Serial No-list. It's boiled down now to having my list in two parts: the Today list, which I process via NLFVP, and the Old list (yesterday and earlier), processed via NL FV. <br><br>(In case anyone needs reminding: in FV, Final Version, a chain of selections is worked off before a new selection chain is created; in FVP, Final Version Perfected, new selections can be added to the chain immediately after each item is done.)<br><br>I like the simple logic of this: the current day's list is created afresh each day and is catch-all and open-ended after that; the old list is a closed list that is steadily cleared. <br><br>The old list can have old items lingering on it, because I can sometimes go a long time before switching to it from the new list, but I don't find that too oppressive.<br><br>One class of items that I remove from the old list daily is recurring tasks like exercise, check inboxes, shop, etc. They regularly appear in the Today list, so don't need to clutter the old list. <br><br>This seems to work well (so thanks, Seraphim).</div>
