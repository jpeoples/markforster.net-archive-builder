<h1>The Simplest and Most Effective Method of All?</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2013-03-7 9:46</div>
<div class="content"><p>I’m using a very simple method myself at the moment, which is proving very effective for me. I’m describing it purely for interest as<em> I do not recommend it for other people’s use</em>.</p>
<p>It consists of the following steps:</p>
<p>- Write down three tasks</p>
<p>- Do the first two in order</p>
<p>- Add another two tasks (so there are three tasks again)</p>
<p>- Do the first two in order</p>
<p>- Repeat ad infinitum</p>
<p>The method can be used with all one’s usual lists, reminders, etc, but I myself have found it works best for me the less I consult them. This is because every time I do two tasks the method requires me to think carefully about what I should do next. This seems to result in a training effect on my mind enabling it to grasp the totality of what I have to do. This ability is inhibited by relying on lists and reminders.</p>
<p>As this method is intended for myself only and<em> not recommended for other people</em>, I have disabled discussion on this post.</p></div>
