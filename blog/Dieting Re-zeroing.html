<h1>Dieting: Re-zeroing</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2007-03-29 10:28</div>
<div class="content"><p>My set of electronic bathroom scales has died. It kept giving error messages and the weighings became increasingly inconsistent, so I decided to buy a new set. Now I am the proud possessor of a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0009OHAHI?tag=markforstthet-21&camp=1406&creative=6394&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=B0009OHAHI&adid=03C7HX7GGSX4RYRER1YJ&" target="_blank">WeightWatchers 8962U LCD Precision Electronic Scale</a>. It’s much more legible than my old set and also gives the weights to the nearest quarter pound.</p><p>Using a new weighing machine means that it’s best to re-zero, so I’m starting again from this morning’s weight (1.25 lbs above yesterday’s weight on the old machine) with zero rules. I’ve also decided that it’s a good opportunity to go back to the previous method of a steady loss of one pound a week, rather than the Ratchet Effect which I’ve been using recently. What I’ve realised is that the Ratchet Effect doesn’t just ratchet the weight down - it also ratchets the number of rules up. I should of course have realised at the start that it would have this effect, but mathematics was never my strong point!</p><p>Since I’m now moving in quarter pound intervals instead of half pound intervals, I need to change the target weight four times a week. Since I’ve started on a Thursday, I will plot the quarter-pound drops on Saturdays, Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays.</p><p>I’m going to keep the new rule I introduced of “Single Course only” on the list of rules as it seems to work well.</p><p><em>(Full details of the diet I am following can be found </em><a href="/blog/2006/12/4/can-i-improve-on-the-no-s-diet.html"><font style="color: #0072bc" color="#0072bc"><u><em>here.</em></u></font></a>)</p></div>
