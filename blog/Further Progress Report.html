<div class="content"><p>The final step in getting this website fully functional has now occurred and it is operating happily under the <a href="/">www.markforster.net</a> address, complete with its prized Google 5/10 rating.</p><p>The only problem seems to be that the new address has thrown all the Google ads off just as they were beginning to adjust to what this site is about. </p><p>And what's happened to all my spam? I haven't had a single piece of spam since the re-hosting, even though I set the email host's spam filter to OFF. Knowing how inaccurate some spam filters are, I prefer to deal with my own spam through the medium of my highly trained copy of <a href="http://www.inboxer.com/products.shtml">InBoxer</a>. (I get no financial reward for that recommendation btw)*</p><p>*Memo to self: Must change that!</p></div>
