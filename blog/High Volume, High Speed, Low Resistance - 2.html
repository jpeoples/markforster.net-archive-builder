<h1>High Volume, High Speed, Low Resistance - 2</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2017-07-2 23:30</div>
<div class="content"><p>One more characteristic of the system, which I forgot to mention yesterday: </p>
<ul>
<li>It does not use any form of pre-selection </li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the second day of the trial the page count is as follows:</p>
<p>1-11 - 0</p>
<p>12 - 7</p>
<p>13- 17</p>
<p>14 - 24</p>
<p>15 - 13 (out of 13)</p>
<p>Total: 61</p>
<p>That means that 100 tasks were worked on today, including every one of the 56 tasks that were on the list at the beginning of the trial yesterday.</p>
<p>Notice too how the new system has consolidated the list left over from the previous system - which was spread out over 11 pages - down to only 4 pages.</p>

    <p>By 6.20 p.m. today I’d cleared two out of the four pages left from yesterday and started two more. So the list still extends over only four pages.</p>
<p>I’ll be doing some further work this evening, though not a lot as we have friends over.</p>

<div>I like the concentrating effect. <br><br>The sheer length of the grasscatcher list seems to dilute my energy with my focus. Yesterday, I restarted with half a dozen key tasks at the bottom of the list and then went back and scrubbed all the old tasks which were covered by the new ones. <br><br>Seemed to help.</div>
