<div>Gorsh, I'm practically famous! I'm surprised by how many things are out of date in that video already. Also, I used 'bethany' for my username for example purposes, but my real gallery is at beeminder.com/b if anyone is interested.</div>

<div>Btw, the "written explanation on youtube" is a near word-for-word transcription of the video.</div>

<div>Thank you Mark and Beeminders. I've been following Mark's various posts on the subject and reviewing the website. <br><br>From a layperson's viewpoint, I think beeminder has got the underlying psychology and motivational aspects to goal setting and achievement very well thought out and researched. I think I'm about ready to jump in myself.</div>

<div>I *love* the rose-colored dots!! What a great idea. For about a week now, I've been tracking a couple of goals in Beeminder, and the whole process is feeling good and working surprisingly well.<br>Thanks, Bethany & Daniel et al for a great tool.<br>And thanks, Mark, for sharing it with us on your site.</div>

<div>Why is she laughing throughout?  I thought it a bit annoying, as if she couldn't take her own product seriously.</div>

<div>JT,<br><<Why is she laughing throughout?>><br><br>I found it to-die-for cute but decided not to mention it at the time. As a former 20-something midnight hacker myself, I'm glad to see our tech startups haven't lost their personality.</div>

<div>Oh come on folks, Beeminder is HIGH-larious business. And so is my co-founder making silly faces at me behind the camera :-)</div>
