<h1>Democracy in Action</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2007-01-11 13:50</div>
<div class="content"><p>If you are a citizen or a resident of the United Kingdom you may be unaware of the <a href="http://petitions.pm.gov.uk/" target="_blank">10 Downing Street petition si</a>te. This is an official inititiative of the Prime Minister by which ordinary citizens (i.e. you and me) can petition him about any subject.</p><blockquote><p>Downing Street is working in partnership with the non-partisan charitable project mySociety to provide a service to allow citizens, charities and campaign groups to set up petitions that are hosted on the Downing Street website, enabling anyone to address and deliver a petition directly to the Prime Minister.</p></blockquote><p>The most three most popular open petitions at the moment are:</p><p><u><font style="color: #0000ff" color="#0000ff"><a href="http://petitions.pm.gov.uk/traveltax/" target="_blank">Scrap the planned vehicle tracking and road pricing policy</a></font></u>.   248,161 signatures (as at 1.57 pm today). This reached 200,000 votes at 4.30 pm yesterday.</p><p><a href="http://petitions.pm.gov.uk/huntingactrepeal/" target="_blank">Repeal the Hunting Act 2004</a>. 18,490 signatures</p><p><a href="http://petitions.pm.gov.uk/IDcards/" target="_blank">Scrap the proposed introduction of ID cards</a>. 10,217 signatures</p><p>If you support a petition you can sign it very quickly. If you are against a petition, you can start a counter petition.</p><p>Having started this site with a fanfare of trumpets, the Government will have a problem if it is seen simply to ignore very popular petitions. So sign up to your favourite petition today!</p><p>P.S. Apparently they gave some thought to allowing people to vote against a petition, but rejected the idea. However it does open up a vision of subjecting proposed Government legislation to a Digg or Reddit type vote.</p><p> </p></div>
