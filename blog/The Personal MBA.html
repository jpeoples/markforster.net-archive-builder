<h1>The Personal MBA</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2011-11-29 16:15</div>
<div class="content"><p>A quote from Josh Kaufman’s new book “The Personal MBA”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To keep yourself from feeling overwhelmed, track your projects and tasks separately. Here’s what I do: I always carry around a notebook that contains a 3 x 5 index card. The card contains a short list of my active projects. The notebook contains my to-do list: the next actions that will move my projects forward, which I process using a system called <a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/autofocus-system/">“Autofocus”</a>, which was created by Mark Forster. The system helps me use my intuition to identify what I can do <em>right now</em> to make progress.</p>

<div>Hi, Mark - just saw this post pop up in my RSS reader. I'm a big fan of Autofocus - I've been using it since version #1 with great success, and I'm looking forward to more details about your "final version." All my best!</div>

<div>Brilliant Mark!  Such cross referrals are worth their weight in gold, just in terms of the exposure and visibility of your system.<br><br>I'll certainly be on the look out for Josh's book when I get a chance, and of course, am eagerly awaiting yours.</div>

<div>Very nice.<br><br>Recently I was on the receiving end of some mockery from some guys who seemed to think that everyone should manage all their time management information via a smartphone.  Especially an IT person such as myself. So, always good to see the ol' notebook being validated! :)<br><br>Plus, of course, the well deserved accolade for Mark.</div>

<div>Josh's book is fantastic, and this reference is exactly how I found Mark back in January. Thanks to both of you. :-)</div>

<div>Interesting, what he said. When I was using Autofocus, I always ended up dismissing the same "tasks", over and over. These tasks never seemed to be ripe enough, even when re-entered to be more specific. Actually, they were future projects that I would tackle when I would be over with current ones. I never thought of making this distinction between "projects" and "tasks".</div>

<div>I have got  card prepared for whenever you get items or support to provide on the "final version" and with the New Period around the element I'm sure you KNOW that greater productiveness is always on every your collection.</div>

<div>MBA is considered as the best career choice because of number of divisions available in it. For all types books for MBA online you can try McGraw Hill books.<br><br><a href="http://www.tmhshop.com/marketing" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.tmhshop.com/marketing</a></div>
