<h1>Thoughts on the Long List - Update</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2017-10-3 10:32</div>
<div class="content"><p>I wrote a couple of short articles earlier this year about long lists (aka catch-all lists):</p>
<p><a href="../blog/Thoughts on the Long List.html">Thoughts on the Long List</a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="../blog/Thoughts on the Long List.html"></a><em>My theory is that a properly handled and practised list removes the need for prioritization, goal-setting, planning and deadline-chasing.</em></p>
<p><a href="../blog/The Natural Selection of Tasks.html">The Natural Selection of Tasks</a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="../blog/The Natural Selection of Tasks.html"></a><em>There is no such thing as procrastination. What we call “procrastination” is just our minds working through the selection process.</em></p>
<p>Since then I’ve been doing an enormous amount of work on this subject, and I’m going to be writing a series of articles on the results. These <em>might </em><em> </em>become the basis for a book. The first one should be up soon.</p>
<p>In the meantime I recommend reading or re-reading the two short articles above to set the scene.</p></div>

<div>How exciting!<br>Can I request some features to cater for those who tend to build up a rather long todo list/backlog.<br>I find with the current system, I need to put in some prioritisation methods to avoid missing deadlines etc. I would like to avoid that where possible as it is just extra work managing it.<br><br>I know the advice is to not get overloaded, but in reality who ever manages or is able to properly control that? I notice that whenever I get more up to date, I just work slower (Parkinson's law). How odd, but true!</div>

<div>Mr Backlog:<br><br>Working slower as one gets get more up to date is often a symptom of being adrenaline-fueled. This is not a good way of working - apart from anything else it's bad for one's health.<br><br>I hope that my upcoming series of articles will enable people to find a better way.</div>
