<h1>Halving with 5-4-3-2-1 Follow Up #2</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2021-08-11 21:36</div>
<div class="content"><p>At the end of the day the stats are:</p>
<p>Page 1: 33 done, 0 remaining</p>
<p>Page 2: 33 done, 0 remaining</p>
<p>Page 3: 22 done, 11 remaining</p>
<p>Page 4: 13 done, 20 remaining</p>
<p>Page 5: 5 done, 28 remaining</p>
<p>Page 6: 4 done, 23 remaining</p>
<p>———————————————</p>
<p>Total: 110 done, 82 remaining</p>
<p>=================</p>
<p>That’s in a bit less than two days. It seems to be progressing satisfactorily. I’m particularly pleased that the number of tasks remaining seems to be static, and also that the 5-4-3-2-1 method has not once failed me.</p>
<p>I’ve been thinking up some other ways of using 5-4-3-2-1 which I want to try out. So I’m going to leave the Halving system for the time being and do some more experimenting.</p></div>
