<h1>Reminder: Registration Expiry</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2012-01-24 15:34</div>
<div class="content"><p>This is just to remind you that the number of registrations for the Forum is limited to 250 and that number is currently filled.</p>
<p>This means that every time I get a request for a new registration I delete the existing account which has been unused for the longest time. The current longest one has been unused for 1 year 73 days.</p>
<p>So if you haven’t used your account for a while and want to make sure it doesn’t lapse, all you have to do is log-in to the account. You don’t have to make a post.</p>
<p>If the number of requests for accounts rises considerably so that the unused period before deletion gets unacceptably small, I shall have to shell out some extra cash and upgrade my account with Squarespace. Mind you, that would also allow on-site registration so that would be some compensation!</p></div>
