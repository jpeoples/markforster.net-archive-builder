<h1>Order and Harmony</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2017-04-3 8:23</div>
<div class="content"><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span>“First there must be order and harmony within your own mind. Then this order will spread to your family. Then to the community and finally to your entire Kingdom. Only then can you have peace and harmony.” </span>Confucius</em></p>
<p>The <a href="../blog/Entries for the Lenten Challenge.html">Lent Challenge</a> is now in its final week with only four full days to go. I hope there will be more than a few people who made it through.</p>
<p>The point of the challenge was not to prove any particular system but to experience the effects of being consistent. </p>
<p>The quote from Confucius above is highly relevant.</p></div>
