<h1>New Menu Item: Articles</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2012-01-21 13:15</div>
<div class="content"><p>I have added a new menu item for Articles. This accesses the blog category Articles, which shows the contents of the blog with all the minor posts removed, such as administrative messages, news items and passing thoughts or queries.</p>
<p>So by using this tab you can quickly get to the important stuff on the website. Try it and see.</p></div>

<div>Alan:<br><br>Sorry you're having a problem with this. I've rechecked it and for me it goes to <a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/category/articles" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/category/articles</a><br><br>I'm afraid I've no idea why it doesn't work for you.<br><br>Anyone else having problems with it?</div>

<div>Sorry, I get what you get. I just assumed you would rather link to <a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/category/articles" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/category/articles</a></div>

<div>Alan:<br><br>You have completely lost me with that last comment. If you're getting what I get, why are you telling me a) that you are getting something different, and b) that you thought I'd prefer to link to what I am linking to?</div>

<div>Mark,<br><br>I think Alan means that the site domain is www.markforster.net, but the link goes to markforster.squarespace.com. You would probably prefer for the link to point to markforster.net like all the other menu items.<br><br>Wooba.</div>

<div>Wooba<br><br>Thanks for explaining it. <br><br>No, I really don't mind one way or the other. Markforster.net is just an alias for markforster.squarespace.com.</div>

<div>I have my browser configured so that clicking a link to a different domain will open a new window - what that means is that the other links in the menu change the content of the current window (www.markforster.net), but the articles link opens in a different window (for <a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com)." target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com).</a><br><br>The main reason I do it this way is so that search engines and collector websites stay open while the referenced websites open in other windows.<br><br>It is not a big deal, certainly, but it is something to be aware of as more and more people customize their browsers for maximum personal efficiency.</div>
