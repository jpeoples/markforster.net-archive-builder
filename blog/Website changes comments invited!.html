<div>A massive improvement, I really like it.  Not sure whether you've changed any of the material around (like the useful blogs links etc..) but everything seems a bit more obvious and "to hand" than it used to.  Excellent stuff.</div>

<div>Overall the site looks more stylish, but a couple of points:<br><br>1) The font used in the editorial material is a bit too large to my liking. The previous one was simpler but more readable. For headings the new font is excellent but not for articles.<br><br>2) The placement of the top menu (home, blog, ...) is good. The links to main sections are there at the top and not mixed with "lesser" content. However, the light grey links on white background are very hard to notice for a newcomer. The larger and darker headings grab the attention as do the stuff on light blue background.</div>

<div>This 45-year-old loves the larger type! I think the layout is very attractive and more user friendly. Good job!</div>

<div>Dear Andy, Nick and Janine<br><br>Thanks for the comments so far. Having two marginal columns means that things like the Useful Blog links are much more to hand. Before one had to scroll way down the page to see them. Having the navigation at the top helps in this respect too. <br><br>I can experiment with darkening the colour for the navigation bar, but I'll leave it as it is for the moment to see whether this is a major concern.<br><br>I'm in two minds about the size of the font. It does of course depend rather on what screen resolution people are using. For me it's much more readable, but I'm using a high screen resolution. For those using a lower resolution it may seem too large. Again I'll leave it as it is for the moment to see what other people's reaction is.</div>

<div>I'm a new reader, but I love the white space and the soothing blue! I also like larger type, but it does mean more scrolling.<br><br>Looking forward to visiting regularly - and buying your book!</div>

<div>Font size is easy to change in the browser. It would be more usable if your font sizes were all relative rather than absolute since that would play more nicely with user preferences. For example on my large display desktop I have font sizes set larger and on my tiny laptop I have them smaller.<br><br>Also, the serif font is great for printing, but most people generally find sans serif fonts more readable on a screen. I usually set my web sites to have sans for display and serif for printing. Easy to do in the CSS.</div>

<div>Mark<br><br>Hi.  Good layout and easy to navigate - feels much better and more dynamic.<br><br>Personally I prefer sans-serif font such as Arial which is easier to read and the top navigation could be in a stronger colour to stand out more.<br><br>Best wishes<br>Peter</div>

<div>Rob:<br><br>Thanks for the point about relative v. absolute font sizes. Actually I though the font sizes were relative. I'll have to investigate that, and if necessary take it up with Squarespace.<br><br>Mark</div>

<div>Love the overall look and feel of the new site.<br><br>I'd prefer a smaller font size for the editorial - easier to read. Also I didn't notice the top navigation - I had to go looking for it after reading the comments! Think darker would be better - perhaps grey on blue like at the top of the centre column?<br><br>Keep up the good work<br>Cheers, Ian B</div>

<div>I agree with some of the other comments. Stylish design, but I find myself doing more scrolling and I think the Navigation Bar is a little too subtle in colour.</div>

<div>"GET EVERYTHING DONE" - that will defeat a lot of people, because we know we can't get it all done and that in fact we have to be selective in what is urgent/important (S.Covey).<br><br>Use something softer :  "GET IT DONE" or "GETTING IT DONE" ?<br><br>Thank you in any case, Mark, for all your good tips over the years.<br>Marite</div>

<div>Marite:<br><br>Get Everything Done is the whole point of what I write about. I disagree with Stephen Covey over prioritising by importance. If it needs doing then it must be done.</div>

<div>Hi Mark<br>just got back from two weeks holiday so thought I would see what I had missed and wondered at first if my browser was playing up.<br>Colour scheme is good.  <br>Struggled to know where to look to find the blogs and forum pages directly.  Now I have found them it is ok, but I would prefer a better colour contrast for the top navigation bar. <br><br>p.s spent the two weeks reading your Dreams book.  Very enjoyable but also a little scary.  You make it all sound so easy and flowing.    I look forward to seeing where this process takes me.</div>

<div>Hi Mark, the differing font sizes messes with my head a bit.  I'm used to having all the same fonts on a page for consistency.   It could be that I'm on a laptop and so have a smaller screen, but I find it's easier for jumping around from article to article or page to page when it's all the same size.  Thanks!</div>
</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Mark Forster - 2008-08-4 18:59</div>
<div>Karen<br><br>I'm not sure what you mean by the fonts being different sizes. All the editorial matter is the same size, i.e. articles, blog postings, discussion group postings. The margins are different sized fonts, but that is standard on most websites. <br><br>Could you elaborate?</div>

<div>I like the redesign, Mark. The whole website seems clearer; more spacious and inviting somehow. I'm on a PC and am finding the fonts easy to read and the layout clear. Do agree with the comments about the colour depth for the navigation bar, though, I think it could be a little darker (eyes aren't what they were...)</div>
