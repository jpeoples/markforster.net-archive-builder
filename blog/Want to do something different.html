Then when I learned that they did introductory courses for people of any state of proficiency or none, I decided to have a go.</p><p>Anyway I was right - it was fun, a lot of fun. The three instructors Teresa, Miyuki and Neil obviously loved their subject and just seemed to want to communicate their enjoyment of the drumming to us. Each course takes 18 people and all the instruction is as a group. Most of the instruction was done by Teresa, who is a wonderful teacher, knowing just how to pace it so the energy never flagged and keeping our interest going throughout. There is just so much one can learn in two days of course, but we managed to give a concert performance at the end to a (very small) invited audience.</p><p>They don't run many introductory courses and the places are very limited, but they are taking bookings now for one on 17/18 March. So if you want a really fun break from your normal activities, I can highly recommend it.</p><p>See <a href="http://www.taikodojo.com/education/workshop.php">www.taikodojo.com/education/workshop.php</a> for further information.</p></div>

<div>If you posted that at 11:19 on Saturday, did you break your new rules about structure and only having the computer on during certain times?</div>
