<h1>High Intensity Use of Time - Progress (or lack of it!)</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2017-11-17 22:45</div>
<div class="content"><p>Unfortunately I’ve been having some problems with my new High Intensity system which means that for the time being I’ve been forced to put the projected ebook on hold.</p>
<p>In the meantime I’m currently taking a break from long lists by going back temporarily to my favourite No List system - <a href="../blog/The Next Hour of Your Life.html">The Next Hour</a>, which as always I’m finding very powerful.</p></div>

<div>Hi Mark,<br><br>I hope you are well..  Even though it didn't have the results you expected, will you reveal the High Intensity system at some point?</div>
