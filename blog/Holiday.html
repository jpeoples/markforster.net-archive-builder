<div>I'm in desparate need of a todo/time management system and have been holding off trying out SuperFocus in anticipation of the Final Version.    <br><br>I bought and got a lot out of  "Do It Tomorrow", but have fallen off the horse since then, and feel like I'm falling behind further every day...<br><br>Any chance of at least finding out the differences in the rules between SuperFocus and Final Version?</div>

<div>David:<br><br>My recommendation would be to use SuperFocus until the Final Version is released.</div>
