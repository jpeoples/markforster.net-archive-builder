<div>Is there any kind of work book or work sheets to accompany 'Do It Tomorrow'?  I would like to share the principles with people in a practical way with the aim of them becoming habitualized good self-management habits.  (I attended your seminar at 'At Work Together' in Eastbourne a number of years ago Mark and have been an advocate of yours ever since.)</div>

<div>Dear Mark<br><br>As at this moment, no, there aren't. I've always felt that, as the book is easy to read and one can put the principles into effect immediately, there is no need for work sheets.<br><br>Note that at the beginning of the book there is a page which summarises the method, so you can get going even before you read the book!<br><br>Mark</div>
