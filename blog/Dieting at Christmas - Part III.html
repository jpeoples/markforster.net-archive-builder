<h1>Dieting at Christmas - Part III</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2006-12-28 12:10</div>
<div class="content"><p>To my amazement this morning I was exactly on my target weight for the day. This was a much faster recovery than I was expecting. All I needed to get there was the first two rules: No Second Helpings and No Snacking, both of which remain in force. The next hurdle will be when the target weight drops on schedule by half a pound tomorrow. Nothing out of the ordinary after that until a large meal on New Year’s Eve and another large meal on New Year’s Day. And when I say “large” I mean LARGE!</p><p>This diet is truly proving itself to be both effective and extremely easy. In fact for most of the four and a half weeks since starting it, I have eaten perfectly normally without any rules in place at all. If I get through into the new year ok, I will write it up properly with the tips which I have picked up on the way so that other people can follow it if they wish.</p><p>To sum up, I have a rare feeling of confidence in this diet - both that I will have no trouble at all in keeping to it, and that it will enable me to lose the weight I want.</p><p><em>Full details of the diet I am following can be found </em><a href="/blog/2006/12/4/can-i-improve-on-the-no-s-diet.html"><font style="color: #0072bc" color="#0072bc"><em><u>here.</u></em></font></a></p></div>
