<h1>"Who Am I?"</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2007-05-9 8:12</div>
<div class="content"><p>When we are facing a challenge or have a goal that we intend to accomplish, we are used to asking ourselves the questions: “What do I want to achieve?” and “How can I do that?”. But there is one question that we rarely ask ourselves, and that is “Who do I need to become in order to achieve this?”</p><p>So often we think that by changing our circumstances we can change ourselves,but the truth is the other way round: if we change ourselves the circumstances will follow. Otherwise we may succeed in changing the circumstances, only to find that we taken our old self with us.</p><p>Whenever you catch yourself saying “if only….” then it is a pretty good indicator that you are blaming the circumstances rather than working on yourself. It doesn’t matter what it is:</p><p>“If only I’d had a decent education”<br>“If only my boss appreciated my work”<br>“If only I was married/single”<br>“If only I had known this when I was younger”<br>“If only I could get lucky”</p><p>Let’s take as an example that you have a desire to set up your own company. Ask yourself the question “Who would I need to be to achieve this?”</p><p>List the qualities you think you would need, for example: persistence, well-organized, persuasive, etc. etc.</p><p>Now act as though you were that person. Use the power of “I am” statements to re-educate yourself about your own qualities. “I am persistent”. “I am well-organized”, “I am persuasive”.</p></div>
