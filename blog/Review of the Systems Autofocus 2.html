<h1>Review of the Systems: Autofocus 2</h1>

<div class="content"><p>The rules for AF2 can be found by <a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2009/6/27/autofocus-2-time-management-system-af2.html?SSScrollPosition=114">clicking here</a>.</p>
<p><em>Brief Summary</em></p>
<p>AF2 was an attempt to solve the problems AF1 had with urgent tasks and tasks that needed to be done in a particular order. It used the same undifferentiated list of tasks as AF1, but dealt with them in a different way.</p>
<p>Instead of treating each page of the list as a unit, the complete list was treated as one unit, thereby making the number of lines on a page or the number of tasks remaining on a page irrelevant. Selection of the next task was done by going to the end of the list (i.e. the last task entered) and moving back from there until a task “stood out”. There was also a dismissal process in which the first block of unactioned tasks was put on notice of dismissal each day.</p>
<p><em>Advantages</em></p>
<p>All tasks on the list were potentially able to be done at any time (unlike AF1 where you were restricted to tasks on the current page). It was a good system for keeping track of a myriad of urgent tasks.</p>
<p><em>Disadvantages</em></p>
<p>Although better than AF1 at dealing with urgent tasks it was even more liable than AF1 to favour easy tasks over more difficult ones. With a long list, it could also take a considerable time to decide on the next task as often many pages had to be gone through before a tasks could be selected.</p>
<p><em>Conclusions</em></p>
<p>AF2 was one of the less successful methods, and I don’t think many people use it now. However if I was put into a situation where I had to juggle a lot of urgent tasks, I would certainly consider it as a method of keeping them under control.</p></div>
