<h1>The Perfect Time Management System</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2015-05-8 12:11</div>
<div class="content"><p>For millenia the best minds in the world have been searching for the perfect time management system. Finally, after twenty years of thinking about little else (or at least that’s how it felt), I have at last managed to invent it.</p>
<p>I hope this will be an incalculable boon to humankind. Imagine, no more frustration at not being able to trust yourself to achieve what you want. Imagine, always being able to decide to do something and know that you will do it. Imagine, being able to unfailingly steer the optimum path through all the clashing priorities of daily life.</p>
<p>The system is very simple. Once you know it you will be hard pressed to think why it would take one person five minutes to think up, let alone twenty years. Yet, as far as I know no one else has ever thought of it before.</p>
<p>Here are a few characteristics of the system:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s a “universal capture” system, i.e. you can enter any task or project without any pre-editing or prioritizing.</li>
<li>It’s equally suitable for pen and paper or electronic means.</li>
<li>It can deal with any size list, from the smallest to the largest.</li>
<li>No matter what order the tasks are written in, it will always give you the optimum path through them.</li>
<li>It has no problem with urgent tasks.</li>
<li>It encourages “little and often”.</li>
<li>You can attend meetings and write down tasks and queries straight into the list.</li>
<li>Resistance becomes a thing of the past.</li>
<li>You can enter provisional tasks, i.e. ones you haven’t decided definitely whether to do them or not.</li>
<li>You can brainstorm straight onto the list</li>
<li>It requires no randomizers or other equipment.</li>
<li>and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ll be writing more about this in a week or so’s time.</p>

<div>I wonder what will turn out to be the "transforming idea" that's key to this system. (As 'standing out' and 'dismissal' were for the AF family, Colley's rule and urgency were for FV, etc.)<br><br>I echo the others. I can't wait to see it!</div>

<div>What a tease! Looking forward to the details.<br><br>But seriously, Mark, consider a different name. PTMS is unpronounceable. (I won't say it's not Perfect, but doubt that you will be unable to improve on the method, whatever it is.)<br><br>Consider that FV wasn't really Final, UTMS wasn't really Ultimate, AF wasn't really Automatic, etc.<br><br>We in the geek community like self-referential acronyms, so PERFECT could be a good name, e.g. Perfect Efficient Routine to Facilitate Effective Control of Time.  I'll let you trademark that one, if you like it.  :-)</div>

<div>@michael<br><br>The excitement of something new lol. <br><br>Although I am very satisfied with how my system is right now (it does for me what Mark's Perfect system promises---universal capture, works with pen and paper or electronic, cuts through resistance, able to brainstorm, able to plan, able to handle projects, works with big or small lists, etc.) I am also curious to what Mark has cooked up and I want to see if I can incorporate some ideas into my system, or maybe even replace it totally if it really is good.</div>

<div>@michael:<br><br>"What do you expect will be different for you when using Mark's new system?"<br><br>I'm deliberately keeping my expectations low. I don't believe any system can live my life for me.

<div>I'm interested in seeing the inevitable pattern of reactions from the denizens of the forum to any new system Mark introduces. There is critique, there are field tests, there are the tweaks, there are the anti-tweakers and the pro-tweakers, there is the cooling off period after the flurry of posts, there are cool reasoned explanations of philosophy and daily practicality, and then everything settles down and we go back to what we were doing before :)</div>

<div>I was thinking that it's been about a week now, so Mark should be writing the next installment soon. I just checked the timestamp, and can't believe it's only been three days since he posted this! Must've refreshed the page 100+ times so far, anxious for new wisdom from the master . . .</div>

<div>Wow! That's quite a list of advantages Mark. I love the anticipation of something new. Looking forward to reading about it. It doesn't even have to turn out to be perfect for me - if it's even better than the various other systems of yours I've used that would in itself be well worth diving into.<br><br>Can't wait!<br><br>Matt</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Brad Mills - 2015-05-12 6:28</div>
<div>I've never found anything that worked better than FV for me (though I've tried to find something that cut down on resistance). I do find that as the list grows it becomes more tedious to create a new chain. By the way, FV is a blast with Wunderlist, now that syncing works beautifully.<br><br>I'm intrigued and hopeful your new system it isn't radically different from FV.</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Daneb - 2015-05-12 14:29</div>
<div>@Mike Brown:<br><br>Good point but what you describe is not anything what would be special only for Mark`s forum, but what is universal experience when dealing with anything new: testing, enthusiasm, excessive using, reactive abandoning ("anti-movement") and in the end appropriate use (or not, depending on the usability of the concept); including becoming fans, anti-fans... (e.g. Alfred Korzybski wrote about these exact stages when describing acquisition of any new meaning). But I would say that what you forgot is that this process did not end in<br><br> >>and then everything settles down and we go back to what we were doing before :)<<<br><br>but in USING the (method, advice, Mark`s tip or new meaning in Korzybski`s sense) - maybe sometimes, maybe when appropriate, maybe in individualized way, maybe integrated with previous experiences. In the end, our views and approaches how to deal with tasks/work ARE definitely CHANGED. And for me, it is the meaning of all our discussions, ideas we share, tweaks. We are not unchanged by them.</div>

<div>For those of you building up obsessive-compulsive habits by checking this site lots of times during the day, a more relaxing option is to use a web page monitor. <br><br>If you are using Google Chrome, something like this might suit you: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/page-monitor/pemhgklkefakciniebenbfclihhmmfcd <br><br>If you monitor this particular page: <a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog</a> then you'll be notified also when Mark next does a new blog post</div>

<div>Hey, some of us still use RSS feed readers...<br><br>On Monday, I was just about to plunge into GTD when I happened upon AF. I thought AF looked more promising.<br><br>Yesterday, I was ready to plunge into AF, but then I discovered FV and thought it might work a little better for me.<br><br>(I also ordered a copy of DIT to read, because the windmill of my mind demands constant grist.)<br><br>Today, I was all set to start FV, but now I see PTMS on the horizon.<br><br>What to do?<br>This is not helping with my procrastination habits at all! ;-)<br><br>Seriously, though, I'm starting some system this weekend, if not sooner. I have to do it while I'm still in the mood to do it. If I wait too long, I'll cool off, get distracted, and forget all about it.</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Andreas - 2015-05-13 19:38</div>
<div>Or just use a RSS feed reader like Reeder, feedly or whichever you prefer, and subscribe to <a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/rss.xml" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/rss.xml</a> - instant notification when the new post hits.</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Alan Baljeu - 2015-05-14 17:39</div>
<div>JulieBulie, just pick one and start.  It's easy and there's no risk: AF and FV are both better than whatever you were doing up till now.  If something better comes later, it's not hard to switch.</div>

<div class="comment-meta">ubi - 2015-05-14 18:32</div>
<div>Another great one that can be started with no preparation at all is SMEMA – see <br><br><a href="../general_forum/Original SMEMA instructions & FAQ.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2106746</a><br><br>for the original instructions and FAQ.</div>

<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">JulieBulie - 2015-05-14 22:35</div>
<div>Thanks, Alan and ubi. I decided to go ahead with AF last night and had a usable list in no time. It's way too soon to tell how well it will work for me, but I had to start somewhere.<br><br>I did check out SMEMA, but I don't think that's the right solution for me. I really need to write everything down. I don't need to act on all of it, but keeping a list of just three things at a time virtually guarantees that I will find three other things to do instead, no matter what they are.<br><br>I have some other "systems" in place for specific situations, but I'll post about those over on the poll discussion page.</div>

What do you expect will be different for you when using Mark's new system?"<br><br>When Mark introduced the original AutoFocus back in 2009 it really changed the way I approached my work. I was an enthusiastic user of AutoFocus during the spring and summer of 2009. Since then I have backed off somewhat as I have learned the pros and cons of AutoFocus for my particular circumstances. But I still come back to the system regularly, and have a list going right now actually (those timeless words: "2. Go through the page more slowly looking at the items in order until one stands out for you...").<br><br>I don't really have high expectations but Mark always seems to come up with clever and original ideas. I'm sure that at least some aspect of Mark's new system will find its way into my own workflow in some shape or form.</div>

<div>I have been away from this site for ages, only come back to it after I got an update about Jupiter's progress and experiences.<br><br>For the past couple of years I have been using Todoist.  It has a few problems now and again, but it has an optional built-in incentive feature which encourages me often.<br><br>The recently I saw a video demo of using GTD using Todoist.  Next thing I find myself reading a Kindle version of the latest edition of David Allen's book, updated and only released in the last couple of months.<br><br>Yet again I am tantalised by what Mark has up his sleeve in the next few days or so.<br><br>A luta continua.</div>

<div>For those asking "When?":<br><br>Mark said he'd write more about this in a week or so's time. This can be anywhere from a week to two weeks. Also, bear in mind, Mark did not say he was releasing the system in a week or so's time. He said he'd "write more about this", but that's all he committed to publicly.</div>

<div>If you look closely, you can almost read the worn button on my keyboard that used to say "F5".<br><br>But yeah, I hope he takes the time he needs to refine his new system and express it fully and clearly. I'm sure he would also prefer to post it during a time he's available (and willing, lol) to answer the initial onslaught of questions after release.</div>

<div>> He said he'd "write more about this", but that's all he committed to publicly<br><br>I think it's a point worth emphasizing. All Mark has said is he would write more about it. That's not the same as disclosing the system. I'm sure he must have used that particular unusual wording for a reason.</div>

<div>I've only been using AF for a few days, but I'm already so happy with it (compared to anything I've ever tried before) that I feel sort of greedy for hoping that the next system will be even better.<br><br>Well, now everybody knows: I'm greedy.</div>

<div>My fear is that Mark's blog was hacked and the hacker decided to post this and will never post anything else.  I don't think this is true, the post has too much detail from other systems.  I do wish Mark would come along along and save me from procrastination, lethargy, laziness....</div>

<div>It is a good sign that Mark is not posting frequently. If you were using the perfect productivity system, would you expect to be spending much time posting on blogs and web forums? Probably not. If half of what Mark said is true, one hopes he is out accomplishing significant goals and will update you folk in "a week or so".</div>

<div>I think he's running a Google analytics test to see the impact of increasing his return visitor count tenfold. So I'm just doing my part by visiting the website several times a day. I still think FV will be tough to beat for productivity (and simplicity).</div>

<div>It is conceivable that someone has forced Mark to write under duress. Consider that he wrote "Here’s a few characteristics of the system: [. . .]"<br><br>I cannot recall a grammar mistake like this, in any of his previous writing.</div>

<div>Eric:<br><br>My greater fear is that Mark's website was hacked shortly after he released his book Do it Tomorrow in 2006. For all we know, the person creating the systems to date has been an imposter bent on programming our minds with layers of algorithms designed to produce the ultimate sleeper agents. At some point, he will activate us all and send us to do his bidding.<br><br>Actually, I think was Mark's plan too. So, either way we're toast, and we should definitely not be looking forward to the final layer!</div>

<div>Hey! Ho! Back from holiday (Greece since you ask) and will write another blog post on the subject of the new system very soon.<br><br>What I can tell you now is that the system is a development of the FV system. Although the change is not that large, it makes a huge difference to the effectiveness of FV - at least for me.</div>

<div>Hope you had a great time, Mark.<br><br>May I make a request? If it's not burdensome, could you send a tweet when you're going to be away from the site, letting us know when you expect to be back?<br><br>That way, the productivity of this productivity community might not collapse, with everyone checking the site three times a day.<br><br>But perhaps you've abandoned Twitter.<br><br>Best,</div>

<div>Chris Cooper:<br><br><< If it's not burdensome, could you send a tweet when you're going to be away from the site, letting us know when you expect to be back? >><br><br>It's my policy not to mention holidays - and other trips - until I'm back from them. A security thing - skulduggery on the internet and in the world in general is very real. <br><br>Usually I can take part to a limited extent in the Forum while I'm away, so you don't even notice I've gone. But this time I had unforeseen connectivity problems.</div>

<div>I'm glad you were able to enjoy a vacation without the interruption of connectivity. We're glad to have you back as well. And I'm thrilled to hear that your new system is a development of FV! I look forward to hearing more. <br><br>You released FV when I was in my final year of graduate school. It was my easiest year by a mile. My classes were not any easier, but FV allowed me to stay on top of everything like I had never experienced before. So it holds a special place in my heart. :)</div>

<div>Yep ... I am also very pleased to see this is a FV based system.  <br><br>FV has worked for me longer than anything else I have tried, and although I have to use an approach for refreshing/ weeding the FV list each week, it in essence works brilliantly.<br><br>I do also make use of little tag symbols for resistant tasks and short/quick ones and each day (if the fancy takes me) I will do a resistance pass or a 'quickie' pass to start the day and get me motivated.  <br>I can therefore see that FV lends itself to different 'perspectives' and am very interested to see what Mark has awaiting for us in the wings!  ...Hopefully not Ant. and Dec.!<br><br>Now, where is that F5 button?</div>

<div>Hello all.  I'm trying to write this without sounding rude but...<br>I'm spending a small amount of time here each day looking to see if the perfect system has been described yet.  Would it not have been kinder to say nothing at all and then just...pop...release it.  Especially since I'm assuming its free.<br>I'm very very keen to see this latest offering, impatient even, I have ADD (or SCT) whatever label fits and finding a system that works is the holy grail for someone whose executive function is a slow burner.<br>Just my 2p</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Chris - 2015-05-21 0:35</div>
<div>Roger, without wanting to sound equally rude, there's a somewhat unhealthy level of neurosis being displayed over Mark's announcement of an improved process. It's a bit cheeky to then castigate him for not delivering to your exacting schedule. This is a place where ideas get discussed all the time.  And in any case you know my opinion - the only system that works is the one where you roll up your sleeves and do stuff, not the one where you spend all day moving notes about stuff through a system according to some algorithm, which can provide a wonderful tool for procrastination.  The answer truly lies with your own approach to what you do every day, not in a system per se. While you're waiting for enlightenment give it a go.</div>

<div>Roger:<br><br><< Would it not have been kinder to say nothing at all and then just...pop...release it. >><br><br>Kinder perhaps. More effective, no. <br><br>My experience is that a "cliffhanger" like this is the best way of getting a new method noticed if I think it's a really important one (which I do). If it's just released without prior notice it sinks without trace. <br><br><< Especially since I'm assuming its free. >><br><br>Actually I haven't made up my mind about that. It's the main reason I haven't released it yet.</div>

<div>Chris,<br>"Roger, without wanting to sound equally rude, there's a somewhat unhealthy level of neurosis being displayed over Mark's announcement of an improved process."<br><br>I have to agree. There is nothing wrong with being excited about a new approach and it may well be an excellent approach, but I can't believe a person is truly serious about becoming more productive if he is hitting F5 on a blog multiple times a day when the promised update - not system release, mind you, just "more on this" - was said to come "in a week or so." Does such a person truly want to become productive and effective with a new tool to help remember things and decide in what order to proceed in a simple way, or does is a magic pill what he is looking for?</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Austin - 2015-05-21 4:02</div>
<div>Mark,<br>What interests me more than the new system itself (though I am patiently curious about that) is how your thoughts have changed since you were expressing these kind of ideas:<br><br>"What I have been doing is testing out various systems (including SMEMA) which don't use a continuing to do list or someday/maybe list. They've all proved sufficiently effective for me to doubt the necessity or even the desirability of the said lists."<br><br>You said that in regards to SMEMA and the system described in your new book. Do you still agree with this, and if so, why is the new system better?</div>

<div>If you're talking about selling the new system standalone, I could see making a few bucks off some of us regulars who have enjoyed visiting your site over all the years. After all, we know what to expect when you say you are releasing something new and that your very bright claims about this new system are genuine and aren't to be instantly disregarded as overselling. <br><br>How would discussion of the new system work? Whether on this forum or others, people talking about/getting help with a system generally reveals its workings after a short while.</div>

<div>Roger L: I am sure you did not mean to come across as rude, but I was also referring to the speculation about hacking and other nefarious deeds by some others as well<br><br>I suppose its the age we live in.  Maybe I am a bit too security-conscious at times myself, but I do work "In Strange Places (with) Questionable People" , to paraphrase the BBC's John Simpson.  At present, some elements in the expat community where I am are buzzing with Al Shabab rumours; such rumours are a cost-effective way to spread unease.<br><br>It makes shopping excursions interesting.<br><br>Back on topic: I too would be willing to pay for a system as simple and powerful as Mark has described.  I just hope those on this site will get a discount!<br><br>A luta continua,<br><br>Roger J</div>
