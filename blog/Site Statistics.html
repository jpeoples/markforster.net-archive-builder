<p>As I have several times written before, <a href="http://www.alexa.com/" target="_blank">Alexa</a> is a useful tool for anyone who runs a website or is interested in websites - which probably includes most of my readers.</p><p>You’ve always been able to find out things on Alexa like the traffic rank of any site on a world-wide basis, sites which link into it, and the other sites most visited by the people who visit the site. Now they’ve added a couple of features (or perhaps they’ve just made them easier to find). One is a breakdown of where the readers of a site come from. Here is the breakdown relating to this site:</p><p><span class="full-image-float-none"><img style="width: 362px; height: 177px" alt="41265c68f44ee2cc-5a22.png" src="/storage/41265c68f44ee2cc-5a22.png"></span></p><p>No great surprises there, though I would have expected the percentage of United States readers (18.6%) to be a little higher judging from the amount of correspondence I get from the US. Perhaps they just like communicating more than the Brits!</p><p>Another new feature is traffic rank by country. Here’s the ranking for this site:</p><p><span class="full-image-float-none"><img style="width: 334px; height: 178px" alt="41265c68f7edcbaa-acab.png" src="/storage/41265c68f7edcbaa-acab.png"></span></p><p>It’s certainly very gratifying to find that this site is the 9,908th most popular in the United Kindom, and it’s great to see that it’s so popular in Spain too.</p><p>By the way, I used the very convenient screen clipper built into <a href="/www.evernote.com">Evernote</a> to extract the figures from the Alexa site.</p></div>

<div>It might be because they are .png files rather than .jpg. Is anyone else having a problem viewing them? I can change them to .jpg, but there will be a loss of quality in the image.<br>Mark</div>

<div>I couldn't see them in my RSS reader (Google) but they're fine on the site - using IE7.</div>
