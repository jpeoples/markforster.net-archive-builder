<p>Several people are using methods of their own invention. This is a good chance to field test a system of your own if you have one.</p>
<p>You may be asking yourself the question “Why sign up now since the beginning of the Challenge is still two and a half weeks away?</p>
<p>You don’t <em>have</em> to sign up until the last minute, but signing up now gives you a chance to iron out the bugs in whatever system you intend to use. And if you find the system unsuitable then you have time to change it for another before the start of the Challenge.</p>

<div>Alright, count me in. I shall be using a 5x5 'Productivity Bingo' card, populated using a weighted randomiser. My 'Productivity Bingo' uses a reward system at its crux (also positioned randomly) and I am allowed to unlock that reward if and only if I complete the other tasks that form a Bingo line with it (i.e. it has to be the last thing checked off if you were to call "house" on a row, column, or diagonal).<br><br>If a task cannot be achieved (if it is time- or location-specific, for instance), only then am I allowed to remove the task without completing it, but then the gaps in the Bingo card have to be repopulated (using the same weighted randomiser) and the grid shuffled. It sounds complex, but I have coded the whole thing so all I need do is add the tasks to their appropriate sublists, and early tests have shown that I am more focussed on doing the important things first (although I also have a sort of Auto-Focus built into the digital version of my cards to help with that).</div>

<div>I don't think I have ever signed up, but I do tend to use systems way past their expire date. I will keep to 4 by 2 ( <a href="../general_forum/4 by 2.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2732127</a> ).</div>

<div>Mark<br>Will you be applying the AF2 dismissal rules?</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Mark Forster - 2019-02-18 22:04</div>
<div>Caibre65:<br><br>No, I won't. The AF2 dismissal rules were designed to encourage one to scan back to the beginning of the list. This isn't necessary with AF2 Page Lock as this happens automatically.</div>

<div>Unless something goes awry in the next few weeks, I'm going to try and stick with the Time Surfing method from Looman's book.</div>

<div>Hello, Mark & friends:<br><br>Signing up, with a deep practice of "How to make your dreams come true". I'm using this system now, but I decided to take the Lenten Challenge to focus on this incredible book.<br>At the same time, I think I will use Google Calendar with reminders to track my commitments. But as the focus is Dreams, maybe this can change.</div>

<div>Okay, I'm committing to a plan, starting today.  Let's call it the Serial No-List, but with a very specific strategy I'm hoping I can pull off, specifically:<br><br>Rule 1: At any time I may do whatever I choose, but before I do anything non-trivial, it must be on the list.  If it isn't there, write it.  Then I may do it.  <br><br>Rule 1 is my only true commitment.  Rule 1 is simple enough (see Atomic Habits) that I can hope to stick with it.  All the rules below are secondary.<br>--------------<br>I believe Rule 1 fits within the framework of the Serial No-List, and adding the four below amounts to the full rules Serial No-List.<br><br>Rule 2: If I finish a task, delete it.  If I set aside the task unfinished, move it to the end.<br><br>Guideline 1: Define tasks such that they can be completed.  Avoid "keep house clean" tasks in favor of more narrowly defined chores.  Since these will be completed and deleted, the list should keep trim.<br><br>Rule 3: Each day enter the date.  Write some things I want done today. Additional things (which may or may not be done today) can be entered at any time.<br><br>Guideline 2: Don't add things now that I don't intend to do now, if I have no doubt I'll remember later.<br><br>Rule 4: Look at today's list for things to do.<br><br>Rule 5: If rules 1 and 4 don't inspire action, scan back through older days for things to do.<br><br>---------------<br><br>Rule A: Sometime in the bookends of the day, follow a routine which includes checking the calendar and logging.</div>

<div>Dear Mark,<br>after failing miserably last year with AF1, I will try it again this year (of course!).<br>Good luck to everybody.</div>

<div>I would like to join in with the challenge. I procrastinate far to often, and am easily distracted. I have used AF2 in the past, so intend to use this method. Starting today for practice!</div>

<div>The best challenge for this spring. :) I choose AF2.</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Ryan Freckleton - 2019-02-28 4:31</div>
<div>I'll join as well. My system of choice is AF4 with one modification: Audits of the dismissed items must occur via a written task in the AF4 list itself, not automatically when I cycle through.</div>

<div>I'm going with Serial No-List.  The biggest challenge for me is that I'm going to stick to paper and pen (actually an erasable notebook but still analog).  Every time I try to go digital, I make the greatest looking to-do lists with all kinds of details and notes and links, etc.  But, until I can figure out a way to earn money just for making great looking lists, I'm going to focus on getting stuff actually done - using pen and paper!</div>
