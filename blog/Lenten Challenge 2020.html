<h1>Lenten Challenge¬†2020</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2020-04-9 16:29</div>
<div class="content"><p><strong>LESS THAN A DAY TO GO!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Challenge ends 11.59 pm 9 April. Don‚Äôt fall out within sight of the finish!</strong></p>
<p><strong>But please let us know if you do fall out (Comment Section on this thread is no longer closed)</strong></p>
<p>‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî¬†</p>
<p>We intend to run our traditional Lenten Challenge this year.</p>
<p>The idea is to commit yourself to using the same time management method every day for the whole of Lent without changing to a different method.¬†</p>
<p><strong>This year Lent runs from Wednesday 26 February to Thursday 9 April (both inclusive).¬†</strong></p>
<p>If you wish, you may leave out non-working days if you do not normally use a time management method at home. You should be consistent about this though.</p>
<p>This is not intended to imply any religious affiliation or purpose whatsoever.</p>
<p>Last year a good proportion of people completed the challenge. Let‚Äôs make it 100% this year. I myself intend to use Reverse AF2, which is basically the same as Simple Scanning except that you scan from the beginning of the list each time.¬†</p>
<p>You can sign in for the Challenge any time before the start of Lent (your local time) in the comments to this post (or email me). All you need to give is your screen name and the system you intend to use. You can use your own system if you like. You can change the system you‚Äôre going to use right up to the start of the Challenge. If you change it after the start of the Challenge you‚Äôve failed!</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL NOTE:</p>
<p>The whole point of the Challenge is that it is an exercise in consistency, i.e. sticking to the same thing for a set period of time. So to play fairly you should get your system in as good shape as possible before the start of the Challenge, but then keep further modifications until the Challenge is over (or you‚Äôve pulled out, whichever is first).</p>

<div>Hi,<br><br>I am excited to play along.<br><br>Last year I used, and succeeded with "the Bounce." The Bounce is fun low maintenance way to do work. I love it, but I had some problems, in particular I bit off more than I can chew when it came to work, started a lot of things, and did not always complete work early enough. Everything always got done in time, but I would always wonder if I didn't bounce through a long list, would I get more important things done more quickly.<br><br>So I changed. Since 1/1 I have been following "3T with timeboxing and backlog." Each day is a blank sheet where I add to a grid three tasks that come up from my head. In general, I work on each for 5 minutes, then 10 minutes, incrementally until it is completed (at least for now) or I hit 25 minutes. After 25 minutes it goes back to 5 minutes. This is what I mean by timeboxing.<br><br>I do have a list where I capture everything and one of my "Ts" on many days is to go through the list, doing tasks, moving to project pages (that get hit with 3T when I think of that project), or letting them sit.<br><br>It's been working extremely well, so this will be my Lentan system: 3T with timeboxing and backlog</div>

<div>Mark - I really enjoyed last years challenge. Thanks for hosting again. <br><br>My Own System (No Title)<br><br>Tools: Notability (iPad and Mac)<br><br>Workflow: A daily journal that captures 4 things:<br><br>1. ACTIONS: Tasks for ongoing projects, promises made to others and myself, etc. Each action receives a ‚ö†Ô∏è to indicate "attention". When action is taken, the time, along with a short note is added in open/closed brackets i.e. (9.40 AM - I did this and this thing)<br><br>2. PREDICTIONS: Make a prediction, see if I'm right. All predictions receive this icon üßôüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. The goal is to regulate my anxiety which should increase my ability to make more accurate predictions.  <br><br>3. QUESTIONS TO PONDER: Questions receives this icon ‚ùì<br><br>4. UPDATES: Capture any progress on ongoing projects. Always begins with time and location: 9.48 AM @ home<br><br>At the end of the week, I read through my daily entries and write a brief weekly summary of what is finished/unfinished. At the end of the year (on December 31), I re-read my weekly summaries and craft an annual narrative about highs/lows.<br><br>I use emoticons for workflow (‚ö†Ô∏è, üßôüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,‚ùì) and major projects (Podcast;üéô Book: üìñ Health:üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Learning Family Systems Theory: üß†). These graphics add a bit of flair to my journal, while providing a visual map of what I worked on on a given day.  It also allows me to search for certain projects and workflows in Notability.<br><br>Here's an example: https://ibb.co/p4yRhg1</div>

<div>I have been revisiting Simple Scanning lately, carrying a single notebook to/from work/home, letting everything mix together, no segregating of tasks. Anytime I feel myself wanting to add categorization or complexity, I tamp it down and keep to just writing tasks down one after the other.<br><br>I also keep a memo book in my back pocket for notes on the go, errand lists, panic lists, etc.<br><br>I also use a little worksheet I picked up somewhere on the web to help me plan my week with 3 most important tasks to accomplish (MITs), and then below that for each day, the current initiative and the 3 MITs for that day. It helps provide a horizon for the week.<br><br>And I track work done in Evernote daily logs.<br><br>There are helper tools all around the edges but the heart of this Lenten challenge will be using SS.</div>

<div>Count me in. <br><br>I plan to use the Simple Scanning method with a notebook and fountain pen(s) for the entire Lenten duration. <br><br>The only caveat is that I need an online location to keep track of a huge number of reference urls for potential articles (I'm a part-time blogger). For that I'll be using Things 3, but ONLY as a reference system to keep track of potential links, not for actions.</div>

<div>I'm in.<br><br>I've been a fan of FVP for a while- it's the only thing that kept me afloat at my last job.<br><br>My current job requires a lot less planning, but I have more moving pieces in my personal life, and I have recently been using FFVP to get things done rather than ignoring them.<br><br>I'm still making tweaks to my system, but this is what has been working for me well lately, and what I plan to use during this challenge:<br><br>FFVP, but with a few modifications.<br><br>1. If a task has information, due date, or other context, add that info in parentheses after the task.<br><br>2. If a task is unactionable because you're waiting on something- can't be done until a certain date, need info from another person, need another task to be done first, etc, put that info in brackets, then dismiss the task using a highlighter.<br><br>3. Put a task on the list to "review dismissed items" and do that task at least once per week.<br><br>4. Upon review, any items that will be actionable in the next week are crossed off and entered at the end of the list. Any items that are no longer relevant are deleted.<br><br>5. If any dismissed items remain, add "review dismissed items" again.</div>

<div>I will be using Simple Scanning with coloured crayons, journal and stop watch.<br>My method;<br>Everything goes in the journal.<br>When completed I colour the whole line in with a different crayon each time. My journal is very colourful.<br>I have an app on my phone with a large bright digital stop watch in minutes and seconds.<br>I start this for each task. The purpose is not to beat the clock but to be aware of how long tasks are  taking and more importantly when I feel like quitting I always try and add a few extra minutes or seconds of work before I go onto a new task. It is a bit like running a marathon, towards the end you are just aiming to make it from telegraph pole to telegraph pole.<br>There is no anxiety starting tasks and a great deal of satisfaction pushing yourself to completion.<br>At the end of each line I write down how much each task took and what I have noticed is I don‚Äôt quit as easily and spend more time on individual tasks.</div>

It reminds me of Mark's "most important" article, where he just pauses to monitor how good he is feeling several times per day. The common element is the idea of just observing what is happening, rather than trying to prescribe or change what is happening. The observation by itself can trigger the improvement without any conscious effort. I've been using the same idea with measuring my weight, and with seeing how many miles I walk in a week. <br><br><a href="../blog/The Most Important Thing I've Ever Written.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2017/7/25/the-most-important-thing-ive-ever-written.html</a></div>

<div>avrum - This is probably off topic, but it was interesting reading the clip from the interview that you had posted in your screen shot. Sounds very similar to the issues in organizational change. Something that really helped me in organizational change was recognizing that the elements comprising the inertia have value and purpose - they are not just dysfunction and doing what is comfortable. The status quo exists for good reasons, and all the forces of conservatism that act to protect the status quo exist for good reasons. The problem is that there are additional needs that are not being met. This creates a deep conflict. There is some great writing by Dr. Kelvyn Youngman on this topic here:  <a href="http://www.dbrmfg.co.nz/Advanced%20Efrat's%20Cloud%20&%20The%20Matrix.htm" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.dbrmfg.co.nz/Advanced%20Efrat's%20Cloud%20&%20The%20Matrix.htm</a><br><br>Does family therapy recognize the value and purpose of the inertia of the status quo? Or does it see inertia as inherent desire for security and comfort? I'm asking because I'm wondering if there is anything I can glean from it that can be used in organizational change. And in any case, it's always fascinating to me how different fields can be dealing with problems that have so many deep similarities.</div>

<div>For the Lenten Challenge, count me in. I will probably be using DIT, combined with using TOC Thinking Processes to assess the situation if I ever find myself needing to do an "audit of commitments". When that happens, I do some work to discover the core conflict that is preventing me from staying on top of my work. <br><br>I was doing the same thing with Serial No-List, whenever I found myself feeling a little overwhelmed, and found that the TOC conflict discovery & resolution process was even more helpful than anything I was doing with Serial No-List itself. So my experiment has been to see if the TOC approach can be applied to other systems just as well. DIT was always one of my favorites, so I decided to use it as the basis for my experimenting. It's nice to get back to the methodical nature and sense of closure at the end of the day that DIT always seems to provide. DIT also gives very clear signals when the conflict process needs to be applied. It's also been helpful to do the conflict process pre-emptively, as a kind of weekly review. It helps create more clarity on my real goals, and sharpens my focus.</div>

<div>Seraphim:<br><br><< Does family therapy recognize the value and purpose of the inertia...>><br><br>I can't speak to all the different branches of family therapy. However I practice from a Family Systems model. There are a number of Systems thinkers who are consultants, and not therapists. Some resources: <br><br>John Engels: https://www.leadershipcoachinginc.com/leadership-coaching-inc-blog<br>Dr. Roberta Gilbert: https://www.amazon.com/Extraordinary-Leadership-Thinking-Systems-Difference/dp/0976345528/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=Roberta+gilbert&qid=1581209988&sr=8-5<br><br>p.s. The passage/interview in that screen-capture is from my upcoming book with the late Dr. David Freeman.</div>

<div>I have been using Serial No-List since the last Lenten Challenge and I'm still very happy with it.  My commitment for this Lenten Challenge is to stay with the same software for it, Microsoft To Do.  It has a feature called My Day, which is a blank slate every morning, ready to be populated Serial No List style.  I occasionally look at other software and just waste time on it.  I'm sticking with MS To Do.</div>

<div>I will try.  I don't have a name for what I'm doing, but let's just call it the Well-Structured Day.  The nub of it is that every afternoon/evening I plan out the next day, but this plan is building on a detailed template for the day.  (The first element of that template is the afternoon/eventime planning of the next day.)</div>

<div>Thanks for hosting this Lenten challenge again, Mark! I'm intrigued to try 'The Ultimate Time Management System?' which I rediscovered just now, looking through the list of time management systems. I started my journey here when AF4 came out, baffled by the great principles behind it, but glad when SuperFocus was exactly the right thing for school work. Unfortunately, in uni it didn't do well. Now I'm definitely willing to give the closed list another try! In the last few weeks, dynamic lists have worked great for bigger tasks, so I challenge myself to use UTMS (on paper) + dynamic lists (Zim desktop wiki or paper, whichever is more convenient for the day or type of task) and reap all the benefits I can get from a closed, focused list.</div>

<div>I wrote this as the first comment to UTMS, and it holds true today!<br><br>Mark, this is very interesting. I love AF4 and recommend it often to my staff. It works particularly well for those who have difficulty starting particular tasks, and difficulty making sure that all important tasks get acted on, not just the "loudest" ones.<br><br>But I need to refresh myself of the difference between AF4 and UTMS.</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Mark Forster - 2020-02-21 16:18</div>
<div>vegheadjones:<br><br>The main difference is that tasks remain on the "Old List" until they are completed, instead of being moved to the New List once some work has been done on them. <br><br>I'm also using the Procrastination Buster <a href="../blog/Procrastination Buster.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2007/8/1/procrastination-buster.html</a> to process tasks in the Old List - which is proving remarkably effective.</div>

<div>Hi, just wondering what the definition of success/failure in this challenge: I'm presuming that the aim is to be consistent in doing our best with our chosen system, and learning the lessons of applying the discipline, rather than switching to some other system.  <br>I am doing my best to get a DIT routine established, not always completing my will-do list as yet, but working on applying the system, hence within the terms of the challenge I think?</div>

<div>Hi,<br><br>First time posting, but long time lurker. First, my thanks to Mark: your books and this site are a treasure trove. Thanks also to all the usual posters: it's always an interesting read, even when I do not agree or when it does not apply to my particular circumstances.<br><br>I am signing up for the Lenten challenge; I need to work on consistency, and this seems a good way to do it. I will be using my own, unnamed, system. It uses several DIT ideas, but also has a long list. In short, I basically have a long list, a (mostly) closed weekly list and a closed daily list. If a name is needed, then LL-WL-DL will do (as in long list - weekly list - daily list).</div>

<div>Simple scanning for me!  It's the first time I'll be trying it in earnest, and I think the laxity will make me a bit uncomfortable, but that will be a good thing.  And adding some interstitial notes inspired by the book "Time Surfing"<br><br>"Time Surfing" is a book I learned about from the forums here, which emphasizes monotasking and trusting your intuition.  Technically it recommends using no lists at all, but I think I can get the same effect from leaning into the "standing out" of tasks on the list.  By writing down what I'm doing as I start it, I hope to increase the intentionality of what I'm doing, and notice what I'm *not* doing, to discourage multitasking.<br><br>I'm planning to hold more tightly to noting what I'm doing than to putting everything on the long lists.  If something comes up, I'll just note down that I'm about to do it and go do it.  I have a tendancy to cling to systems as things that tell me what to do instead of supports for my intuition, so I want my list to feel like it's there for me when I need it to suggest ideas, but that I'm free to follow whatever feels right to do now.<br><br>Important for me too, I'm committing to not change the implementation either. I'll be doing it in the notetaking program Bear, using a single note for each day, and treating days as pages.  I'll run the pages like bullet journal pages, mixing notes, links, tasks, etc.  The tasks can be marked with checkboxes and checked off, and the notes can be filtered so you only see the "active pages" with undone tasks, so it's a pretty nice medium.  It has the "ubiquitous capture" advantage of digital without getting all complex like task management software.</div>

<div>Homebrew for me. I followed it fairly well (75%) for several months, but lately I find more and more excuses.<br><br>Weekly (Monday morning or sooner) prepare week spread with list of appointments and things that have to be done this week. Review earlier pages and move tasks forward as appropriate.<br><br>Every morning list key things for the day. Review everything from week spread onward. Move things as appropriate. Can do later in the day if I have a morning appointment, and skip if I decide the night before that I don't intend to do any work that day -- max 2 days/week. (Weekends sometimes need more structure than weekdays.)<br><br>New(ish): Once daily (usually morning) write what I actually did yesterday, anything I want to watch for trends, and, optionally, some reflection. I've tried before, but only keep it up for a few days.<br><br>Also, 30 minutes housework and 30 minutes deskwork each day that doesn't have an appointment or major errands.</div>

<div>26 items in 13 seconds!? At a clip of a half second per item, I can barely read the item much less tap into it standing out.  I‚Äôm probably closer to 1 to 1.5 seconds per item. Standing out must be something a little bit more akin to quickly scanning the room for the color red and quickly noticing the color jump out at you.  No consciousness allowed, just subconsciousness? How does one even practice getting to that speed? When I tried it at that rate, I felt like all my mental resources were going into speed reading and had no bandwidth left for noticing ‚Äústanding out‚Äù.  Seems very much Iike a zen practice where the mind must be at rest while reading.  <br><br>I can see how simple scanning would be awesome if you can spend mere second finding the next task. One reason it hasn‚Äôt yet gelled for me is the time it takes to scan. I often resist writing things down because I don‚Äôt want to add more items that require more time to scan through.</div>

I‚Äôm probably closer to 1 to 1.5 seconds per item. >><br><br>Yes, but...<br><br>If someone presented me with a list of 100 items which I'd never seen before and told me to read through them then I would certainly have to do it quite slowly. But that is not the case here.<br><br>1. All the tasks have been written out in my own handwriting which means that I have had to consider each individual task for the time it takes to write it. (One of the reasons I prefer handwritten lists to typed ones).<br><br>2. I always build up lists gradually rather than try to write every task out right from the beginning.<br><br>3. I would already have repeatedly scanned every item on the list so they would be quite familiar to me.<br><br>So to use your illustration it's more like going in to a familiar room and scanning for the colour red when every item in the room has been recently placed there by you.</div>

<div>I'll do the Reverse AF2, as I wrote earlier, but if the previous task was very short, less than 2 minutes, I continue scanning the list like in Simple Scanning. I find this adjustment makes it easier to do some useful things little and often.</div>

<div>Well it's been great already!  ie getting the system in order ready for the challenge. <br>Noticed already with applying DIT: <br>- sense of lightness after the day, as it is clear the day's work is done, and outstanding items are clearly scheduled so I can relax knowing they are scheduled for attention   <br>- 2/3 of email backlog cleared <br>- major projects running, and more confident that will be done as intended</div>

<div>Mark Forster:<br><br><< That reminds me of the passage in "Brideshead Revisited" >><br><br>LOL!!<br><br>OK, then I suppose by "system" you mean something more like a defined set of rules or methods -- not just the emergent system implicit in your habits and behaviors.<br><br>So as long as you don't use any specific rules or methods for your overall time management, you are good?  But I guess you can still use rules and methods for things like email?<br><br>It sounds like a fun experiment, but I doubt I could keep it up for 40 days!  :-)</div>

<div>I find Seraphim's definition of "system" odd.  If there's no rules or procedures or regularity, it isn't a system.  I guess No System is a change from the blog post which said Reverse AF2 Whatever.</div>

<div>Not sure if I can respond on this thread, but I need to drop out - I have been furloughed, so will not be working after today.  DIT has been superhelpful; I haven't usually completed my day list, but I have done the main tasks of the day, so it has been great for ensuring focus on the key areas and keeping on top of incoming work.  But now I'm doing home and family things, I'm just going to use a Simple Scanning list to keep track of ideas and projects.<br>Thanks again Mark!</div>
