<h1>Experiment Failed!</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2008-03-4 16:48</div>
<div class="content"><p>Normally I try at least to keep an experiment going for a reasonable time before abandoning it. But in the case of the “BBC” system, I’m having to admit defeat on only the second day.</p><p>Although I felt quite optimistic yesterday, today I realised that the system was just making me procrastinate. There was none of the sense of purpose that comes from DIT. It was also very cumbersome and I seemed to spend more time making lists than actually doing any work.</p><p>So with a sigh of relief I’m going back to DIT tomorrow!</p></div>

<div>Hi Mark<br>so maybe this particular application failed, but your original impetus stemmed from finding a solution to unwieldly lists.....that endeavor still stands!  My solution is with my Evernote.  I periodically cull it and sometimes attach notes to the original ideas that are still percolating on the back burner....but I NEVER allow them to stage two of my system (my projects grid or meekly master list until I've made a firm commitment to see it through!  LOL!  This includes both projects and tasks.)  When I have my culling sessions, I sometimes find that many have withered on the vine themselves or a find another entry that's an evolved version of the original entry!  LOL!<br>Of course, I'm sure you already tried this method and it didn't suit you.  Happily, it serves me well!  The main commitment to this system is judicious evaluation and culling!  LOL!  I had to cull 873 entries on week awhile ago.  I only kept about 300 of them so I feel ok again.....<br>Thank you for hipping us to Evernote.  It has so many uses.....I consider it my brain annex!  LOL!<br>vickie</div>

<div>Hi Mark<br>postscript re: procrastination...<br>When I'm having a bout of procrastination, I put little else on that days entry except for either timeboxes or a series of actions relating to the dreaded or feared item.  I focus on meeting my goal on these things ASAP and make sure I have committed to another round of it at another specified date and time to match it's timeline.  I don't allow my attention to stay on any floating thoughts until I've completed a round of it......I MUST stay strict on my attention and prohibit any kind of distractions (ESCPECIALLY my wandering thoughts!  LOL!) to make myself stay on point and press forward!  When I'm aware that I'm shuffling my feet and praying for an out, that's when I MUST batton down the hatches!  LOL!<br>The impetus is both getting it over with and rewarding myself with choosing this I naturally gravitate toward.  My distracting ideas are safely kept in Evernote.......<br>I must keep a clear deliation between the ideas and the commitments.....it's embarrassing to admit, but I do know this about how I operate!  LOL!  *blush*<br><br>Keep us posted....I'm praying that you devise a system that can allow folks like me to be able merge the two without the repercussions of distractions eating up my time and violating my original aims!  LOL!<br>vickie</div>

<div>Hi Mark,<br><br>I guess I am not overly surprised -- I thought that trying to maintain those three lists with all of the varying dates of entry onto the lists would be a lot of overhead.  Why create work for oneself?  I like DIT as it is and I really do not think there is a better way.<br><br>Best regards,<br>-David</div>

<div>I love how you keep us up to date on your experiments, and how you keep trying new stuff. It's all very interesting. Thanks!</div>

<div>Thanks for all your comments. I'm always looking for the "perfect way" - but I'm not sure I'd be content with it even if I found it!</div>

<div>in experiments there are lots of chances about faliure of the experiment because out of 100 the chances of success in experiments are very low and lots of faliure chances.<a href="<a href="http://www.find.com/science/science_experiment">experiment</a>." rel="nofollow">http://www.find.com/science/science_experiment">experiment</a>.</a></div>
