<h1>New Book Now On-Line</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2013-10-16 6:49</div>
<div class="content"><p>I’m pleased to say that I’ve just heard from the publishers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The book is now live on Hyperink at this link: <a href="https://www.hyperink.com/The-Pathway-To-Awesomeness-bA210AA213D">https://www.hyperink.com/The-Pathway-To-Awesomeness-bA210AA213D</a></p>
<div>Coupon code: AWESOME for $1 off the price.</div>
<div>Still waiting for it to go live on Amazon (should be really soon).</div>
<div></div>
</blockquote>
<div>According to commenters on my previous post it is now up on Amazon as well, but I haven’t got time to check as I’m about to run my wife to Heathrow to catch a plane to Australia for six weeks. She’s going there for the birth of a grandchild, while I’m staying here for the birth of another grandchild!</div></div>

<div>Stratos:<br><br>Amazon.com seems to have made a mess of the pricing. The book is now shown as "Pricing information not available".<br><br>Amazon UK and Hyperink are both ok though. The discount is only for purchases from Hyperink.</div>
