<h1>Blog Comments and the Discussion Group</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2008-03-14 11:45</div>
<div class="content"><p>I thought I’d just draw your attention to one of the features of this website, which is that it is extremely interactive.</p>



<p>There are two basic ways in which you can contribute. One is by making a comment on a Blog entry, and the other is by joining in on the <a href="/forum/">Discussion Forum</a>. No form of registration is required for either, and you do not have to leave your email address or website details (though you can if you want to). You can either use your real name or a pseudonym. I’ve never yet had to remove an objectionable posting, which is a tribute to the readers of this website, but obviously I reserve the right to. What I <em>have</em> had to do is remove extended quotations of copyright material which go beyond the “fair use” criteria. So please watch this.</p><p><strong>Comments on Blog Entries</strong></p><p>Feel free to comment on any blog entry, however old. The button for doing so is at the top of the entry. All new comments are automatically drawn to my attention, so you can be sure I will read yours and will reply to it if I feel a reply is required. There is also an <a href="/blog/rss-comments.xml">RSS Feed for blog comments</a>, so the subscribers will be aware of your comment as well.</p><p><strong><a href="/forum/">Discussion Forum</a></strong></p><p>Also feel free to join in any discussion or to start a new one. Again I see all new contributions automatically and will reply if I feel a reply is required. Whenever a new posting is added to a discussion subject, however old, that subject is moved to the top of the list of subjects so your posting will be seen by other people.</p>
