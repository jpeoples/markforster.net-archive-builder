<h1>Beeminder.com for keeping your goals going</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2012-01-29 17:38</div>
<div class="content"><p>I’ve just started with<a href="https://www.beeminder.com/"> Beeminder.com</a>, which is a great website for giving yourself the maximum motivation to achieve a goal, whether it’s weight loss, exercise, blogging, book writing or reading, or anything else you can think of.</p>
<p>What I particularly like about it is that it gives you some very sophisticated ways of keeping on track, including some very nice coloured charts with lots of different bits of information.</p>
<p>I’ve started two challenges for myself today. The first is to work myself up to being able to walk 24 miles in a day (I could do 16 before Christmas but have regressed since then).</p>
<p>Here’s the graph that goes with that:</p>
<p><span class="full-image-block ssNonEditable"><span><img src="/storage/Walking Chart.png?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1327859071447" alt=""></span></span>Basically I have to keep myself within the yellow brick road, but there’s a lot more to it than that.</p>
<p>The second challenge is to lose some weight, and here is the image for that (I’ve removed the incriminating evidence for this one!)</p>
<p><span class="full-image-block ssNonEditable"><span><img src="/storage/Weight chart.png?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1327859261383" alt=""></span></span></p>
<p>Note that in this sort of goal you get a period of grace at the beginning in which you aim to keep your weight flat.</p>
<p>I’ll post these images again in a few days time, so you can see how I’m getting on and how Beeminder deals with my results.</p></div>

<div>Ok, I'll bite! :) After reading the guitar post[1] from your other article, I'm now tracking 2 of my old goal nemesis… (curious to see where this takes me)<br><br>[1] <a href="http://blog.beeminder.com/j2j/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://blog.beeminder.com/j2j/</a></div>

<div>You're welcome, Daniel.<br><br>I've got one suggestion. Tagtimer seems a really good application to work with Beeminder, but the instructions on how to install it are written in Geek and I can't understand a single word. Maybe you and the author(s) could get together to make it user friendly and integrated with Beeminder.</div>
