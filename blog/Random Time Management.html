<h1>Random Time Management</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2014-01-22 14:12</div>
<div class="content"><p>As promised in my last post, here’s the method I am using at the moment with great success. You need a random-number generator to work it. The one I’m using is at <a href="http://www.random.org/integers/">http://www.random.org/integers/</a></p>
<p>I am using paper and pen, but I’m sure it can be adapted for electronic use.  I just haven’t yet attempted to do so.</p>
<p>I’m using a loose-leaf binder with lined pages of 32 lines, but the method will work perfectly well with a bound notebook and pages of any number of lines. </p>
<p>First I list all my tasks in the notebook - one per line.<br><br>I then set my randomizer  to produce integers in the range 1 and 32 inclusive. The upper number is the same as the number of lines on a page. This is just a convenient number which produces reasonable results, but you can use a lower or higher number if you wish.  [Afternote: I now strongly recommend setting it for the number of lines on the page and not any other number]</p>
<p>Starting from the beginning of the list I  use the randomizer to produce a number and move down the page that number of lines. I then do some work on the task on that line. Please note that I don’t have to finish that task, just do some work on it.</p>
<p>Once I have worked on the task, I cross it off. If I have not finished it or if it is a recurring task, then I re-enter it at the end of the list.</p>
<p>I then use the randomizer again and count to the next task (going to the next page if necessary).</p>
<p>When the number the randomizer produces would take me beyond the end of the list, I circle back to the beginning of the list, ignoring empty lines on the last page.</p>
<p>I continue circulating through the list in this way.</p>
<p>When I’m counting forward, I INCLUDE in the count the lines which have been crossed off. If I land on a line on which the task has been crossed out, I move to the next line in which there is an active task. I call this movement a “slide”.</p>
<p>For example imagine I have the following tasks:</p>
<p>Email<br>In Tray<br><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Invoices</span><br>Date of next meeting<br><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Write report</span><br><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Cash check<br>Tidy desk</span><br>Performance reviews</p>
<p>I throw a five, so I count down the list, remembering to include the crossed out lines. I land on the “<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Write Report</span>” line. I then “slide” to the next active task which is “Performance Reviews”. Slides work slightly different from counting. If a slide takes you to the end of the page, you circle back to the beginning of the SAME page. So if “Performance Reviews” in the example had already been done, you’d have circled back to “Email” at the beginning of the page.</p>
<p>Email<br>In Tray<br><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Invoices</span><br>Date of next meeting<br><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Write report</span><br><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Cash check<br>Tidy desk</span><br><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Performance reviews</span></p>
<p>Counting crossed-out spaces and sliding are very important, because they have the effect of increasing the chances of the older  tasks  on the list being selected. Note that if you don’t include lines  with  crossed-out tasks in the count, then every task will have an  exactly  equal chance and there will be no preference for older tasks.</p>
<p>A few points to note:</p>
<p>1) Random numbers behave randomly. They don’t behave in the way we expect them to behave. If they did, they wouldn’t be random. You will find that you are constantly surprised by them.</p>
<p>2) The system as described has a built-in bias towards clearing the older tasks off the list. This means that nothing will stay on the list for very long. How long that is depends on the length of the list and the amount of time you can devote to working on it. If you want things to move on really quickly then keep the list short.</p>
<p>3) The random-number generator is quite indifferent to your priorities, wishes and time-pressure, so if something needs doing now - do it!</p>
<p>4) Any attempts to increase the probability of certain tasks being selected will result in the chances of all the other tasks being reduced. So I advise against it.</p>

<div>This is a very clever way to eliminate the fear, uncertainty, and doubt from doing items in a list - while at the same time biasing selection towards older tasks.<br><br>I will have to figure out how to incorporate this concept and make it my own; I seldom have more than 10-15 tasks (projects) active at any one time... Perhaps there's stuff rattling around in my head that needs to be captured.  Wait!  There's a new task!</div>

<div>Bryan E - I'm in a similar boat. I'm currently focused a few projects, and generally don't carry a huge number of tasks. However then I read this comment: <br><br><<Also using cards with one task on each could work. Just shuffle the card. Do task on the top card, move it to the bottom, do second card...occasionally shuffle again.<br>January 21, 2014 at 20:02 |  Unregistered CommenterDaneb>><br><br>And thought: Damn, I've got the perfect tool (arrived a couple of days ago) for this: <a href="http://frictionless.bigcartel.com/category/index-cards" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://frictionless.bigcartel.com/category/index-cards</a><br><br>One card per project.

<div>I've been using this for a few days and I'm blown away by how effective it is.  It generates less resistance than probably any other system I have tried.  I have so many theoretical objections to this method that I cannot answer, but when I use the system, it works.  The more I use it, the more I continue to be amazed how well it works.</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Paul MacNeil - 2014-01-22 21:13</div>
<div>I've been using this method for several days now and I, too, am blown away by its simplicity and effectiveness.  Two thoughts:<br>First, I got into a bit of trouble Sunday because I had a looming deadline Monday which meant I had to break out of the random system just to work on the deadline project.  That might have been because I only started the system on Saturday.  I'm thinking that normally if the system is truly random with a bias towards older items, bumping up against deadlines won't happen.  If it does happen, it might be a sign that I just have too much on my plate, which is a good thing to know.  Of course, as in all Mark's systems, genuine emergencies must take priority - as always, if something needs to be done, do it.  <br>Second, I'm wondering about dismissal.  There really is no dismissal in this system, because there is never a time when I don't feel like doing a task.  In AF1, if I got to a page with a few tasks and no tasks stood out to be acted upon, I would dismiss the whole page.  In this system, if it's on the list it's going to get done unless there is some external reason for not doing it.  I don't know if that means anything or not.  I've been throwing everything at the list, and I love it.  In fact, it's kind of addictive.  I can't wait to see what comes up next, because there are a few favourites I want to get to.  In a way, its unconsciously training me to populate the list with fun stuff I want to do.  This new method is causing me to completely rethink the way I manage my tasks.</div>

<div>Paul<br><br><< I had to break out of the random system just to work on the deadline project.>><br><br>Whenever an exception to the rule pops up - and I rejig the rules to fit the exception - the system loses it's power. And then I lose trust in the system, and soon after, stop following the rules. I know that sounds childish, but it has happened time and time again. So either I follow the rules, and deal with the consequences and rewards, or find something else that works.</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Paul MacNeil - 2014-01-23 0:13</div>
<div>Avrum: I agree. In fairness to the system, I think the logjam happened because I had only just started the system the day before. I keep thinking that had I been using the system the previous week I would have hit on those tasks often enough that I could still work the random system on Sunday (I'm doing my PhD in religious studies and I had 400 pages of a dissertation on esoteric Buddhism to read by Monday morning, which, before I had started the random system I planned to do on Sunday afternoon and evening anyway). We'll see how it goes this week!</div>

<div>Hi Mark<br><br>You stated:<br><br>"4) Any attempts to increase the probability of certain tasks being selected will result in the chances of all the other tasks being reduced. So I advise against it."<br><br>I've been doing exactly what you advise against for years and it has saved my bacon each time.  I'm working from my day's closed list that I've prioritized from a weekly list.  When I'm stalemated, the game helps me to get back on track.  Even though I'm temporarily stuck doesn't mean that I want to do any random task.  By priming the deck, I'm still able to stay on track. I don't see why you'd advise against favoring tasks from your WILL DO closed list.  This way I'm likely to draw close to the number of cards I need to complete the tasks.  The ones that take longer get more cards than the ones that don't and I prime the deck to choose my CI sooner than later.  The reason I'm doing this is to get unstuck.  Once I'm unstuck, I can return to the list.  I honestly don't see how this is a bad thing especially because I know it works perfectly for the times I need to get unstuck.  OTOH, you might advise against it because your list is used for more than one day.</div>

<div class="comment-meta">learning as I go - 2014-01-23 9:28</div>
<div>p.s.<br>I know that you're going to say that I'm going to do the entire closed list anyway.  That's my aim but I want to clear the most important things first in case something happens where I can't actually finish it.  Also, I like to get the PITA stuff out of the way first.  In fact, it's probably those PITA tasks that are stalemating me.  I just need a few nudges that this game helps with.</div>

<div>Great ideas Mark: <br><br>I like to have one list (home & work). I wonder if it is suitable to use the 'slide' to go to the next task that can be done in the current context (if one randomly lands on an task that cannot be done)?</div>

<div>Mark: <br><br>< When the number the randomizer produces would take me beyond the end of the list, I circle back to the beginning of the list, ignoring empty lines on the last page.> <br><br>Do you a) circle back to the first available task on the list or b) continue the count on from the top of the list? a) would seem preferable as it is simpler and seems to lend itself to the bias of addressing earlier tasks.</div>

<div>Suppose I have a notebook with 10 lines, and I tell the randomizer that the upper limit is 10. Then there is a 10% chance of it choosing 1 or a 2 or a 3 or a 4 or a 5 or a 6 or a 7 or a 8 or a 9 or a 10.  These are the stats regardless of whether I use that number to only count active tasks or if I count both active and inactive tasks. <br><br>Now in the example: <br><br>Email<br>In Tray<br>Invoices<br>Date of next meeting<br>Write report<br>Cash check<br>Tidy desk<br>Performance reviews<br><br>If I count the active tasks alone, there is 25%  (1 active out of 4 active) chance of choosing ‘In Tray’. If I count all tasks, there is 12.5% (1 active out of 8 total) chance of choosing ‘In Tray’. If 25%>12.5%, isn’t there higher chances of selecting an old task by ignoring the crossed out items?<br><br>In the next example after some work we have:<br><br>Email<br>In Tray<br>Invoices<br>Date of next meeting<br>Write report<br>Cash check<br>Tidy desk<br>Performance reviews<br><br>If I count the active tasks alone, there is now 33%  (1 active out of 3 active) chance of choosing ‘In Tray’. If I count all tasks, there is still 12.5% (1 active out of 8 total) chance of choosing ‘In Tray’. If 33%>12.5%, isn’t there still higher chances of selecting an older task by ignoring the crossed out items?<br><br>I understand that the list grows with new tasks, unfinished items, and recurring items. But the larger the list the larger the denominator. But, it will always be 1 active task/ N_active > 1 active task/(N_active +N_inactive). <br><br>since: N_active < (N_active +N_inactive), <br>then: 1 active task/ N_active >1 active task/(N_active +N_inactive).<br><br>I’m not understanding the bias. And I feel as if Im missing something significant. Sorry for being a little slow here :) Maybe its how Im reading the rules?  I’m eagerly looking to be corrected, because I feel as If Im going crazy.</div>

<div>The completed tasks remain on the list.   If the randomizer hits one of them, you "slide" to the next unfinished item.   This increases the probability of landing on the unfinished task that immediately follows one or more completed tasks.   This leads to the items remaining on older pages having a high chance of being selected.</div>

<div>Since moving to a Mac, I've been using Circus Ponies notebook as my electronic task repository, and I'm running into problems with the "sliding rule", which is a key part of the system.<br><br>At the moment, after completing or working on a task (which is a Page on the CP task list), I am resorting to inserting a strikethrough page immediately below the task I worked on, then moving the task to the bottom of the list. The strikethrough page then acts as a placeholder for the task I just worked on. If the Randomizer then hits that page, I slide to the next page.<br><br><br>Anybody else here using CP and that has a better implementation idea?</div>

<div>GMBW:<br><br>The chances of any one number coming up are of course exactly the same for each number.<br><br>What is different though is how many numbers relate to any one task.<br><br>At the moment my first active page has 9 active tasks on it. There are 32 numbers (lines) on the page, all of which will result in one of the 9 tasks being selected..<br><br>My last active page has 23 active tasks on it and 29 numbers (lines). So you can see that there is considerably less chance of any specific task on the page being selected.<br><br>If only the active lines were included in the count, then on the first page there would be 9 numbers relating to 9 tasks, and on the last page 23 numbers relating to 23 tasks. So there would be exactly the same odds for every task on all the pages.<br><br>This is important because with equal odds for each task, it can take an unbelievably long time for every task to be actioned. You can try the experiment of seeing how many throws it takes to come up with every number between 1-32 (which is what I have my randomizer set on). I can guarantee you will be surprised.</div>

<div>Seraphim:<br><The completed tasks remain on the list. If the randomizer hits one of them, you "slide" to the next unfinished item. This increases the probability of landing on the unfinished task that immediately follows one or more completed tasks. This leads to the items remaining on older pages having a high chance of being selected.><br><br>This made sense to me a bit. The slide ensures that ‘landing on a crossed off item slides you to the next active task’. Makes sense in terms of proximity. But if I’m moving FORWARD in the notebook to the next active task, doesnt that mean that items remaining on NEWER pages have a high chance of being selected?<br><br>I would think the only way to ensure older tasks are biased is to slide backwards (to tasks before or older than the crossed off item).<br><br>Mark:<br><br><At the moment my first active page has 9 active tasks on it.

So you can see that there is considerably less chance of any specific task on the page being selected.><br><br>My math must be incorrect but:<br>9 active tasks out of 32 lines: 9/32*100= 28% <br>and <br>23 active tasks out of 29 lines: 23/29*100=79%<br><br>So, isnt there higher chance of a task on the last active page being selected since more of the lines are open to being selected? <br><br>Suppose that your entire notebook had only the two pages you describe (the first page and the last active page). So that in total there are now 61 lines to land on (32 lines from page 1 + 29 lines on page 2= 61 lines total). And there are now a total of 41 active tasks (9 active tasks from page 1 + 23 active tasks from page 2= 41 active tasks).<br><br>My math gives:<br>41/61*100=67% <br>meaning 67% of the notebook is filled with open tasks. and the remainder, 33% will yield slides. <br>The only time slides create a bias is when there are more inactive tasks than open tasks.

<div>GMBW:<br><br>If you can't follow the logic in my previous post then I suggest you try an experiment. <br><br>List the numbers 1-32 and see how many throws of your randomizer it takes before you delete the last number from the list using these two different methods:<br><br>1) If the randomizer lands on a deleted number you "slide" to the next undeleted number and cross that off, circling back to the beginning of the list when necessary (i.e. the number after 32 is 1).<br><br>2) If the randomizer lands on a deleted number you throw again until you land on an undeleted number.<br><br>HINT:<br>You can print off a list of random numbers from RANDOM.ORG which will save you time and make it easier to count the number of throws.</div>

<div>Makes sense. Thank you seraphim and mark. I did not understand the slide part. And I seemed to have ignored that slides can take you to the top of the SAME PAGE. I thought that slides can take you to a new page.  so it seemed as if slides continue to take you further FORWARD to new pages.<br><br><br>I'm only now noticing that you and mark mentioned that slides can circle you to the beginning of the same page like 4 times.lol For someone who didn't read the instructions carefully (myself) it is very confusing to find the bias. Now I get it. <br><br>P.s. I believe its the way the post is written.  It seems like you have instructions, an example and then notes. But that key instruction is hidden between two examples. So it could be overlooked like I did.  I'm talking about this part : " Slides work slightly different from counting. If a slide takes you to the end of the page, you circle back to the beginning of the SAME page. So if “Performance Reviews” in the example had already been done, you’d have circled back to “Email” at the beginning of the page."<br><br><br>Anyways, now that I get it, seems pretty cool.

<div>It goes without saying, but using a notebook, you have to ignore fully striked-through pages.

But that introduces new problems...   Since you don't have pages, you can't "clear" pages.   This would result in large blocks of completed tasks.  Your random number range might not be big enough to cross these large blocks.  Example:  you decide to generate numbers from 1 to 32.   But you have a large block of completed tasks, say 35 of them.   Thus you can't cross this chasm - you'd always be sliding backwards to the task immediately preceding this block.  You'd basically be forced to work backwards through the tasks preceding this block.   Maybe that's OK.  But I'd guess it would introduce resistance to the system because the random nature of task selection is essentially removed, till you clear out all those tasks.<br><br>Another problem introduced by a pageless version of the system:   You'd need to choose an arbitrary range for your random number generator.

<div>A very simple electronic version, although not quite along the lines of Mark's system, but still benefiting from random selection, would be a list in Excel. Enter the tasks in column A, enter the formula "=RAND()" in column B. Select columns A and B, and sort by column B. After each task is completed, add any new tasks to the bottom and re-sort the list.<br><br>One key though is to try to avoid seeing the entire randomized list at once, because it is tempting to let your eyes wander to the tasks in cells A2, A3, A4 etc, and then a familiar feeling of procrastination kicks in. Usually I make cell A1 (the first task) very large so I can only see the first task and HAVE to do it.</div>

On Sheet 1 just list each task on its own line in column A.  On Sheet 2 have a macro which generates a random integer between 1 and LastRow.  You could even have conditional formatting for all of Sheet 1 Column A such that if the random number shown on Sheet 2 matches the line number then the line has a yellow background.  This will automatically highlight the selected task on Sheet 1.<br><br>Once the task is done simply delete the row, the remaining tasks will always be sequentially numbered and selected directly by the randomiser.  Sliding won't crop up.</div>

<div>I've lurked on this forum for years and tried most of the the AF versions and FV. I've tried this method since it was launched and I am frankly amazed by how procrastination melts away and becomes in effect irrelevant. I've experimented with random task lists before, and had some success, but the slide element makes this method far better. I don't know why it works so well, it could be some aspect of what economists call bounded reality, and that decision-making is a cognitive drain. But another explanation could be that it is simply fun. There is no quicker way to apply this method than pen and paper and I use a twelve-sided dice as my random generator. Many thanks.</div>

<div>Chris:<br><br><< Correct, but wasn't that the original benefit, with older tasks having had more chance at being selected previously? >><br><br>No, it was designed with sliding right from the beginning. In the first "Shades of the Diceman" General Forum thread Simon described how he selected a page number and then a line number randomly and if the line was crossed out he moved to the next active task. I pointed out that this wasn't fully random as it gave preference to the older tasks. I then adapted his method to produce the one in this blog post.<br><br><<  I thought sliding was just an artifact of the written medium with the happy coincidence of giving undone tasks next to done tasks additional chances of being completed by essentially giving them multiple numbers that select them. >><br><br>No, I realised that sliding was an ideal method for avoiding the problems raised by having equal chances. There's no reason why sliding has to be confined to the written medium. It's just a matter of not deleting the lines that have been crossed out - or using a method like the one you're describing.<br><br><<It is easy to copy in the spreadsheet... This weighting will ensure that the longer an task hangs around for, the more the selections will be biased towards them. >><br><br>Good. I'm glad you've understood the problem with the way you were planning on doing it. Usually it takes more than 120 throws to clear every one of 32 numbers without sliding, but exactly 32 throws to clear them with sliding. So it makes a considerable difference to how long some tasks will hang around on the list.</div>

No automatic disappearing or re-sorting of completed items and the rows remain as they should as if written on paper.<br><br>In Spreadhsheets, items are written one per line top to bottom. In Toodledo, items are written one per line bottom to top.<br><br>In Spreadsheets, it feels like a spreadsheet managing tasks and a bit more cumbersome to add items to.

<div>JD,<br><br>Regarding Circus Ponies NoteBook.app, my issue was how the page layout changes when you resize the window on the screen. There seems to be a default size when you open a new NoteBook, but if you use, for example, the Engineering Pad style, the number of lines and grid squares changes as you resize the window, and there's no obvious way of restoring the default look.  Also, if you put a lot on a page, it scrolls instead of rolling over to a new page. The bound-paper notebook effect is broken, therefore: there's no direct correspondence between what is onscreen vs what you would see if you added the same content to a physical notebook, or to the number of pages you would get if you printed out the whole thing.<br><br>I guess this is what they intend. There are several postings on this topic on the CP support site.  I'll play around with it for a few more days, but doubt I will pay the $50 or so that they're asking for a license.<br><br>We should probably start a new thread on this app in the General Forum, if anyone is interested, instead of continuing to discuss it in these blog comments. . .</div>

<div>The system appears counter intuitive...I mean, selecting what to do randomly? (of course the items on the list are initially deemed important enough to get onto the list in the first place).  However I have to report that the resistance to tasks seems significanly lowered, there's not the 'cognitive drain' of making decisions and it's actually quite addictive!<br><br>I know 'tweaking' Mark's systems can sometimes lower effectiveness, however I'm considering doing some (urgent or context relevant) tasks from the list out of randomisation and marking them as such to indicate this with a second dot to the right of the item. I wonder if this would create any drawbacks?</div>

<div>Hey Mark, have you tried always starting counting down from the first unactioned item, and only counting the unactioned items? Theoretically, that would even focus more on the older items, almost to the point of making it DIT-like. Just curious because that makes an electronic adaptation so much easier.</div>

<div>Hi Mike Brown and Leon,<br><br>Just another thought on adding priorities to the calendar. That's what I do - populate the calendar with items due on a particular day. I also use the calendar as a tickler.<br><br>The last couple of work days I have randomised the items on the calendar as well. For example this morning I had three appointments and six 'all-day' items I am committed to doing today. First thing I cleared off any prep for the appointments. Then I created a short list in the beginning of my notebook consisting of all the remaining 'today' items from the calendar. I set the upper bounds of the randomiser to the length of the list and work the mini-list according to Mark's rules. I'm down to the last two now. It breaks down a little as the list drops to one or two. As I complete work for the day any follow-up items that aren't needed today go on to the calendar if they are time-bound, or on to my master list. Once I'm done with the daily stuff I'll turn to the master list and spend the rest of the day working that.<br><br>I find it helps break down a little of the resistance to the items on the calendar, just as it does for the items on the master list.<br><br>Matt</div>

<div>Matt Gregory:<br><br><< The last couple of work days I have randomised the items on the calendar as well. >><br><br>Interesting thought. I don't think it's what you meant, but I wonder if anyone has tried making a list of the tasks to do within a week and then setting the randomizer to produce a number between 1 and 7 (or 1 and 5 for the working week) to decide which day each individual task should be done? The same principle could be used for a month, and even for "someday/maybe" tasks.<br><br>I have not tried this myself, and probably won't for the time being, but if anyone does want to try it I would be very interested to hear your experiences.</div>

I don't plan ahead on my weeks like that, I simply have reminders in the calendar and my main list of tasks, so I can't readily try it. I suspect there may be too many dependencies to allow randomisation. And then, once tasks are assigned to days, you would end up trying to execute a pre-planned weekly schedule.<br><br>I'm finding that the random selection is working well when the choices are already structured and there are known parameters to the list. That way I can relax and go with whatever comes up. The parameters can be as broad as 'nothing critical today, do anything on the list' or as narrow as '5 critical things to do today', but they are defined and I can roam freely within the limits.<br><br>I did try setting my daily exercise randomly to give an element of surprise and variety. It didn't work because the various types of exercise available to me are dependent on each other. I couldn't, for example, end up with 7 days in a row of randomly assigned very high intensity circuits. <br><br>Matt</div>

<div>I'm tempted, too.  But I think a slightly better answer would be the number of tasks in the system divided by the number of days in the system.  Of course this requires a calculation every morning.  I have a feeling nuntym's suggestion would work well even if we simply continued to use the number of lines per page, e.g., 32, which would remove the need for a daily calculation.  The only real downside is that the system will not deal effectively with urgency.  But then, this is at least a potential weakness in the existing random system as well, albeit not as much of a weakness.</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Mark Forster - 2014-02-3 21:57</div>
<div>Austin:<br><br>I think there is another downside to 32 numbers, which is that it may not succeed in clearing all the early tasks as quickly as we would like. This is because it takes a lot of throws (120+) to clear every number between 1 and 32.<br><br>Perhaps someone would like to try?</div>

<div>Here's one idea.  Generate a random number between 1 and 25.  A result between 20 and 25 means do the first task on the list.  A result between 1 and 20 selects a task from the first 20 unactioned tasks on the list besides the oldest.  This would be simple to implement electronically.</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Austin - 2014-02-4 17:51</div>
<div>Or to handle urgency a bit better:<br><br>Generate a random number between 1 and 25.  20-25 means do the first task on the list.  1-20 means move forward by that many tasks from your last task that was selected in this manner.  Do not count completed tasks or the oldest task in your 1-20 cycling.</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Austin - 2014-02-4 17:54</div>
<div>You can still use 32 to cycle and achieve a 1/5 rate of first task selection (as above) by using 40 as your number.  1-32 means cycle by that many, as usual.  33-40 means do the first task.</div>

<div>Hi Tony and Seraphim<br>If I can't do it at that moment or it's too late to start it (>one hour), I leave it where it is and count it as a slide as if it was crossed out.  That way the list doesn't unnecessarily grow. My list is daily which is fed from the calendar and weekly list.</div>

<div>Hi Tony<br>You'd probably do better to follow Seraphim's advice.  I'm a really hard case so I need to batten down the hatches to greatly reduce my escape options. When I'm dreading work, I treat myself like a cattle being prodded down the shoot for slaughter.  It sounds exaggerated but that's what dread sometimes feels like in my head. The randomization does wonders to reduce resistance and the dread.  Mark has several great work arounds but the randomization method really does the job when I need the assistance.<br><br>I hope it helps you.  Some of the folks say that their resistance actually disappears.  I'm not that lucky but it sure doesn't reduce it enough to help me get my day's list done most days.</div>

<div>I haven't used the randomising approach but I was curious about where it leaves that feeling of being "ready" to do something, or knowing that the time is ripe, rather than doing nothing about something?<br><br>It seems to me the dice allows all options to be emotionally neutral so that none is any more meaningful than another. I wondered if the downside was that it cancels sensitivity to right-timing?</div>

<div class="comment-meta">learning as I go - 2014-02-7 10:43</div>
<div>Hi Michael<br>I can't speak for others, but the matter of right timing is resolved when I create the daily list. The trade off is not jumping right into the enjoyable work so that I will have willingness to also do the less enjoyable work.  The dice helps to prevent overwhelm on particular work because I don't know EXACTLY WHEN I'll have to start it and I also have chances to do work I prefer.  Usually I do my list however I wish just like Mark taught in DIT.  It doesn't matter how I complete it so long as it gets done.  The randomizer helps to neutralize overwhelm.  Also when I get a preferred task, it's even more enjoyable because of the relief I feel that I don't something onerous. Also, I don't spend the entire day on the WILL DO list.  There's lots of flexibility. Win-Win</div>

<div>I use a variation off this method on days I'm having a hard time getting started. In addition to the random number generator, I use a timer. For the first hour of work, I set the timer for five minutes for each task generated. It's AMAZING how many things you can knock off your list altogether in 5 minutes. Then, I take a break for 10 minutes. Then I start another 1 hour block, with 10 minute incriments. I take a 20 minute break. Following that, I work in 20 minute stretches on the randomly generated task with 5 minute breaks. If I finish something early, I simply slide down to the next uncrossed item on the list and work on it until the timer goes off. It's a great way to make progress when there's a LOT to be done.</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Mark Forster - 2014-02-8 11:13</div>
<div>Here's a few things I've picked up as I've been working the system and trying out variations:<br><br>1) Keeping the list reasonably short is essential. At the moment my list is 39 items long and it's working brilliantly. I think it could be a bit longer than that without too much problem, but a long list is too slow to keep the work moving.<br><br>2) I've experimented with all sorts of different ways of improving the system, but so far have not found one single alteration that is better than the rules as written in the blog post.<br><br>3) The easiest way to monitor how well your list is keeping up with your work is to monitor two statistics: 1) the age of the oldest item on the list; and 2) the number of items there are on the list. Since the random method reduces friction and procrastination to negligible levels, if you can't keep up with your work, then the only solution is to reduce the work.<br><br>4) I find this system works best with larger tasks than I use with normal AF or FV. So rather than have a lot of small items, I tend to combine them. For example I would have "Read blogs" rather than list all the blogs I follow; "Finance" rather than all the different actions I take in respect of my finances.</div>

<div>I'm finding it seems to work best if the random number = the number of lines on the page.   This tends to give you 1-3 "stops" on every page -- more if many of the tasks are already cleared.  <br><br>Fewer than that = it can feel like you are getting "stuck" on a page, not moving fast enough forward to where the newest, freshest tasks are located.<br><br>More than that = you have a much higher chance of having only 1 "stop" per page, which really weakens the power of the "slide" rule.</div>

<div>I need one point of clarification.   The first random number is counted from the top of the list, but what is the starting location for the next random number?  I assume it is from the next item after the one I just worked on. Or should I start counting from the top of the list again?</div>

<div>Dave Parente:<br><br>I haven't actually found a need to dismiss tasks yet. I've find the system removes so much of the reluctance to start a task, that I haven't yet refused to do one.<br><br>You can of course always remove any task that you decide shouldn't be done or doesn't need to be done any longer.</div>

<div>hi all,<br><br>My system is a bit different than marks, but today I used the randomizer method to work through my daily list.<br><br>I have to say that I'm REALLY impressed with how well it did at diminishing my resistance to tasks.  I'm going to keep on using it.<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>brett</div>

<div>I've been using the randomizer method and it's working great. My first roll took me straight to a task I'd been resisting for a long time. What a liberating feeling to do it and cross it off! It's remarkable how powerful this simple method is.</div>

<div>I see how this approach gets a payoff of results but how do you build in time to develop clarity about the nuances of the situation and possibilities? Sometimes by patiently waiting you can watch and see something develop to better timing. You have to be able to sit still long enough to get the clarity. Or action can be inner directed, rather than outer : stop a chain of thought, look at things differently, become more aware of habitual reactions, believe something different. Faster execution of bad habits isn't ideal. There needs to be times to take control over our own attention, notice how we feel, and direct our life in a way we want.</div>

<div>Thanks Mark for the response. Yes it seems how you made the rules is the best, and any of my previous ways to make a similar system to work in my checklist program in my smart phone would not work. <br><br>However, after tinkering around, I found out that it is actually easy to adapt this system to my BlackBerry Z10 Remember app, which actually syncs to my Evernote account so I can look it up anywhere. How I do it can also be done using the Evernote program/app itself and even any word processor.<br><br>> Open a note and use Numbered List format to list your tasks, one task a line. Once you have entered your 32nd task, skip a couple of lines, turn off and turn on Numbered List format. This will reset the numbering of the list to 1, and thus you have simulated a page of 32 lines.<br><br>> To pick a task, highlight the task by changing its font color.<br><br>> When you are done with the task, select and cut the whole task. The result will be that the line will keep its numbering but it will be blank. If the task is unfinished or recurring, it can then be pasted at the end of the list. Make sure to revert the font color to black. <br><br>I was surprised how easy this was to implement. In fact, I added another feature to how I do this system, integration of projects, because of how the Remember app and even the Evernote program/app is.<br><br>> Projects are entered to the system by using bold font format on the task.<br><br>> The projects have their own notes with either of two list formats.<br><br>>>If the project is a bunch of tasks to be done in order then the list is in Bullet List format. <br><br>>> However if the project is a bunch of tasks that can be done in any order, then I use Numbered List format and do the project randomly like I would the main list.</div>

<div>@ Michael,<br><br>"I see how this approach gets a payoff of results but how do you build in time to develop clarity about the nuances of the situation and possibilities?"<br><br>This system has no utility whatsoever for urgent tasks, so if you need to do something right away, drop the system and do what you have to do. <br><br>If you need to take a breather from your tasks, seeing that you need to relax and add space to look at the bigger picture, then do that and drop the system for now.<br><br>On the other hand, the system I found has a calming and strengthening effect on me, in that I can use this to build up my confidence that I can do stuff before doing the scheduled stuff that I need to do.<br><br>Sometimes that is all you need, the confidence to do what you need to do, and that can also give perspective on the things you have to do.</div>

<div>@Mark: yup I guess that's it! I seem to have regarded AF et al as not incorporating those kinds of activities. I suppose the learning point is that AF has made me aware of where I disallow that as an "activity". Odd. My list is also a bit short of pleasures I notice. These are good reflective questions.<br><br>To expand the point I suppose I can say if I want *changes*, rather than just productivity on the same hamster wheel, the more different the change is than what I do normally, then the more inner actions will need to appear on the AF list. Change doesn’t happen just from outer actions, or because we wish for it or want it but only through taking different inner actions - even if it is the action to not believe a thought,  imagine a different interpretation, pausing for insights, affirming differnt thoughts, noticing what's better ...</div>

<div>Here is an interesting "random" link:<br><br><a href="http://textmechanic.com/Random-Line-Picker.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://textmechanic.com/Random-Line-Picker.html</a><br><br>There are many cool tools at this site. This one allows you to input (or paste) a list.  It then will pick one item at a time.   I like it when I have a small list of things I must do and it assigns me one at a time.<br><br>I haven't figured out any way of integrating the sliding concept into this tool, however.   <br><br>It does have a graphic test of your browser's ability to pick randomly - which seems to work.</div>

<div>Hey all,<br><br>I have spent many hours over the last few weeks writing a web app that follows this method "to the T." I have a few kinks to work out, but I'm wondering if any of you are interested in using it. I built the prototype to work for just a single user, but I don't want to spend any time on the authentication piece unless some of you are willing to give it a try.<br><br>I may post a short video sometime, but for now, here's a description:<br><br>1) Single-page AJAX application (node, angularjs, mongodb, express, passport, bootstrap, etc.)<br>2) Configurable "per page" amount<br>3) Adjusting "per page" changes pagination immediately<br>4) All rules apply (sliding, choosing next task, etc.)<br>5) You can do a task out of order, but you have to enter a command first (pretty neat really, it makes it less convenient to skip ahead and cross something off out of order)<br>6) Total tasks remaining is easy to see<br>7) Done vs Total per page is easy to see<br>8) Per page minimum and maximum hardcoded by me (any ideas on this? I have 5 as the minimum and 40 as the maximum)<br>9) Responsive design should work on all devices<br>10) Convenient "down arrow" button to complete a task and create a copy at the end of the list (for when you're "done for now" with a task)<br>11) "Easter egg" commands... you'll have to wait and see<br><br>I guess that's enough for now. If there's any interest I'll spend some time making it ready for public consumption.<br><br>Let me know!<br><br>I showed this to some colleagues and they wanted to see a few enhancements:<br>1) history of tasks<br>2) edit a task's text<br><br>-Adam</div>

<div>Hi Adam,<br><br>Sounds neat!<br><br>I shouldn't change for a while yet, other than fine-tuning how I work the list and prioritize things within the system.<br><br>A few things that none of the other systems seem to have:<br><br>Change the date done. If I do something after computer-off time, I want to be able to record it the next day, or even a few days later. This is important for tasks where you want a history (Which day did I do it? How many days this week?) and when the next time depends on when it was done last.<br><br>Support for things I hope to do several times a week. The tasks would still show in the main task list for Randomizer to choose, but with more information.  Maybe how many times you've done it so far this week. If the task is "work out 1st time this week" and it's Thursday, I'm in trouble. Also a report of some type, maybe like Joe's Goals.<br><br>A Hot List capability. Not tons of priority levels, but a way to flag critical things. If the day is busy, just limit selection to the hot list. If the day is light, select from the entire list.<br><br>Future start dates. Due dates.<br><br>Bonus points for email integration. Send email to the list and it gets added as a task.</div>

<div>Okay, I am relatively new to Mark's systems, so maybe I am missing something here.  I am still relatively confused about how to work multiple pages.  Assume the following occurs in my lists:<br><br>1. Say I start with 31 tasks on one page (that has 32 lines).  I randomly generate 7, which lands on a recurring action.  I do the action, cross it off, then rewrite it in line 32.  <br>2. I generate another random number, and get 21.  I do some work on the task, but do not complete it.  Nonetheless, I cross it off and rewrite it...I assume on the first line of the next page.<br>3. I need to go buy milk at the store, so I enter it on the second line of the second page.<br><br>So here is where I am confused and need answered:<br><br>Q1. Does the random number generator limits stay fixed at the total number of lines on the one page each time you use it (i.e. 32)?  Or will it grow to match the exact number of tasks that you have spanning over multiple pages (34, which comes from  32 on the first plus 2 on the second)?  <br>Q2. If it stays the same, do you simply treat each page as a different list and then move on the next page when you want?  What is the criterion for moving to the next page? Do you use the random number generator for each page that you are on individually?  <br><br>Thanks for your help as I try to figure it out.  It seems like a promising technique.</div>

So if you are on line 20 of Page 1 and you throw a 25 you count to the end of Page 1 and then continue on page 2. So you would land on line 13 of Page 2.<br><br>If your count brings you to the end of the list, then you just rotate back to the beginning of the list. Ignore empty lines on the last page.<br><br>The only time that the end of the page is relevant is when you land on a line which has a deleted task. In this case you "slide" until you reach the first active task thereafter. If you reach the end of the page before coming across an active task, then you carry on sliding from the beginning of the *same* page. The reason for this is that otherwise one could not guarantee that the first line of the first page would ever get hit.<br><br>Remove pages on which all the tasks have been done.<br><br>I hope this helps. It's best to try the rules as best you can for a few days then re-read the rules carefully to make sure you are doing it right.</div>

<div>Hello, everyone! I was wondering what these blog posts mean, exactly. Does Mark Forester try different methods and comment on them? Is he always in search of a perfect method? Or is he trying different methods to meet the needs of different people? <br><br>For example, I really liked this "Random Time Management", which I have adapted and used along with another method. Now Mark is talking about the "Spinning Plates". Does that mean Mark abandoned this method, or is he trying another method for another purpose?</div>
