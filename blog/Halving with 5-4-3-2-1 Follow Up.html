<h1>Halving with 5-4-3-2-1 Follow Up</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2021-08-11 8:50</div>
<div class="content"><p>I’ve been going for less than a day with this and already the results are very encouraging.</p>
<p>At the moment I’ve got five pages of 33 lines each and the stats are:</p>
<p>Page 1: 33 done, 0 remaining</p>
<p>Page 2: 26 done, 7 remaining</p>
<p>Page 3: 5 done, 28 remaining</p>
<p>Page 4: 2 done, 31 remaining</p>
<p>Page 5: 0 done, 15 remaining</p>
<p>—————————————————</p>
<p>Total:   66 done, 81 remaining</p>
<p>===================</p>
<p>As you can see it is a characteristic of this system that it is weighted towards the beginning of the list.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important thing to report is that the 5-4-3-2-1 method didn’t let me down once.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Those who want to have a go at this for themselves please note that I introduced a new rule:</p>
<p>If you come to a single task which <em>can’t</em> be done at the precise time that you come to it (e.g. time of day, weather, etc), it should be left in place for a subsequent pass. </p>
