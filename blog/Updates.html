<div class="content"><p>I thought it would be a good idea just to bring you up to date with some of the things I have mentioned that I have been trying out :</p><p><strong><a href="/display/ShowJournal?moduleId=817806&categoryId=90409">Resistance principle</a></strong>. Only just started a few hours ago, but already it's been getting me writing on this blog!</p><p><strong><a href="/blog/2007/1/6/learning-italian.html">Pimsleur Italian</a></strong>. Going brilliantly so far. I feel really on top of the material with a high retention rate (contrary to my previous experience with audio-only courses). My only question is how far into the language the complete course will actually take me.</p><p><strong><a href="/display/ShowJournal?moduleId=817806&categoryId=75905">My Diet</a></strong>. Going brilliantly. I have absolute confidence that, barring accidents, I will get to my target weight on August 31st. It couldn't be easier and it couldn't be more effective.</p><p><strong><a href="/display/ShowJournal?moduleId=817806&categoryId=89062">Fitness</a></strong>. I've not really got going on this properly yet. I hope the Resistance Principle will help me get this established.</p><p><strong><a href="/display/ShowJournal?moduleId=817806&categoryId=81951">Note taking software</a></strong>. Evernote is still my favourite of those I have tried, though I'm hoping that someday the long-promised Windows version of <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/" target="_blank">Eastgate Tinderbox </a>will materialise - preferably while I'm still young enough to use it!</p><p><strong><a href="/display/ShowJournal?moduleId=817806&categoryId=76372">Brainbuilder</a></strong>. I found this too much like hard work and not engaging enough to keep going at it. Even though my scores did improve a bit, I didn't find that I noticed any improvement in mental capacity.</p><p><strong><a href="/display/ShowJournal?moduleId=817806&categoryId=77921">Journalling</a></strong>. Still doing this (not quite as regularly as I'd like) and still finding it very effective. </p><p><strong><a href="/blog/2006/11/8/dogs-of-the-ftse.html">Dogs of the FTSE</a></strong>. In a rather up-and-down period for shares over the last couple of months, the system has held up well.</p></div>
