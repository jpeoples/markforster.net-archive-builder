<h1>Getting Going Again: Update Day 9</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2008-02-28 17:29</div>
<div class="content"><p>I finished my Will Do list today at 5.30 p.m. which means that I have caught up with the last two days when I didn’t finish it completely. As I said in an earlier update, not finishing the list for a couple of days is no cause for concern as long as one catches up within 3 or 4 days. </p><p>I would have finished earlier if I hadn’t allowed myself to be distracted by all sorts of ideas I had about improving this website. Getting distracted is not a good habit to get into, but there are times when the ideas strike and you just have to ride with it!</p><p>I don’t intend to publish daily updates any more as I’ve now got the system working well. But I’ll write about anything interesting that arises as and when.</p><p><em>Previous posts on this subject:</em></p><p><a href="/display/ShowJournal?moduleId=817806&categoryId=166609">Getting Going Again</a></p></div>

<div>Darn, I kind of like the updates! In what order do you tackle your list these days?</div>

<div>I do the Will Do list in strict order (see the first posting on Getting Going Again).<br><br>But within the individual bits (email, tasks, etc) I do easiest first.</div>
