<div class="content"><p>I weighed in exactly on my target weight for the day this morning, so yesterday's addition of one rule (No Seconds) was enough. The rule remains in place though, because rules are only taken off if I am below the target weight. As I selected No Seconds as the first rule on the basis that it is the easiest to keep, it shouldn't be too much hardship.</p></div>
