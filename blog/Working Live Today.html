<p>0800. The list is divided into two unequal parts, divided by a line ———————. Different rules apply to each part. I am starting where I left off yesterday, near the end of the list. The method here is to move down the list taking action on those tasks which feel ready to be done. I will number tasks in the order they are done so you can follow the sequence. The numbers in brackets after some tasks are times, and refer to the log entries at the end of the list (of which this is the first).</p>
<p>0833. This is reminding me why I hate using electronic means of working a to do list! It’s slowing me down no end. The Squarespace editor is also being annoying - a blank line has appeared in the middle of the list which I don’t seem to be able to get rid of. Never mind!</p>
<p>0904. I’ve now reached the end of the list. My next action is to go to the beginning of the list - into the part of the list before the line (——————). Oooooerrrr!!!</p>
<p>1018. Within the first part of the list, I keep circling round the list until nothing further seems ready to do.</p>
<p>1053. I’ve now been round the first part of the list three times, and there’s nothing further that seems ready to do. So now I start on the second part of the list. I only do one pass of this before going back to the first part.</p>
<p>1450. Now reached the end of the list for the second time today. So back to the first part of the list (the “backlog”)</p>
<p>1452. None of the tasks in the “backlog” stand out for action so I have marked them all up for review (on paper I would have used a highlighter for this). At the same time I have drawn a line at the end of the list so that the whole current list becomes the “backlog”. All new tasks will now go below this line.</p>
<p>1528. Now reached the end of the list for the third time today. Notice how fast I moved through the list this time. Back to the beginning of the list.</p>
<p>1534. What I have now done is delete all the items marked for review. You will see that I have re-entered some after rephrasing them. One I have re-entered as it was (A recorded TV program that I haven’t yet had time to see). The rest I have dropped altogether because I decided the time wasn’t yet ripe for them.</p>
<p>1709. Reached end of first part of list - back to the beginning. On another subject, this page has been loaded 5,973 times today (and it wasn’t all by me!)</p>
<p>1847 End of first part of list again - back to beginning.</p>
<p>1849 I’ve been round the first part of the list again without any tasks seeming ready to do - so on to the second part.</p>
<p>2046. Page has been accessed 7,507 times today.</p>
<p>2057 Reached the end of the list again. Back to the beginning. I’ll select a next task, but what I’m really going to do is go and watch NCIS on tv!</p>
<p>2300 That’s it for today. 70 tasks completed. 8,604 page views. I hope that’s given everyone a good idea of how powerful the system is. Now I’ve just got to copy everything I’ve done today back into my paper notebook!</p>

<div>Since Facebook is on your list, which Mark Forster there are you? I didn't see you in the search results I looked through. There is a Mark Forster in the Autofocus Group, but he ... doesn't look anything like you.

<div>good guess, andreas. would make sense if below the line was an open list. i don't think mark is going to tell us much, at least early on. we'll probably have to infer things.</div>

<div>Hi Mark<br>It's 4:14 am here......I'm drugged and riding out the pain via your live blog.  Thanks for the entertainment.  The tv only has junk shows and infomercials.  I have my music going also.  Because I'm still grateful to not have a backlog since you bailed me out of mine a few years ago......I'm am curious as to how you define a backlog these days.....<br><br>You stated:<br>It goes at the end of the whole list when the previous "backlog" is completed. So three days ago that line included the whole list.<br><br>Because I work from a weekly format, I'm shocked that you define work less than 3 days old as a backlog!  LOL!  How do you define it?  Even DIT standards allowed up to 4 days to catch up on the loose ends!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div>Is "task marked for review" the same as "tasks on notice" or "tasks on review"?</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Jonathan - 2009-09-4 9:29</div>
<div>Hi Mark,<br><br>Good morning - and what a good idea to try this here. It would be really useful if you can explain in your running commentary today the rules that you are following, and anything that crops up around why you do and don't do certain tasks. Without knowing what the new process is that you are following it is difficult to appreciate how and why the list is being covered. Also why and how there are two lists, or two parts to the list.<br><br>Regards,<br>Jonathan<br>----<br>The list is divided into two unequal parts, divided by a line ———————. Different rules apply to each part. I am starting where I left off yesterday, near the end of the list. The method here is to move down the list taking action on those tasks which feel ready to be done.</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Frank - 2009-09-4 9:41</div>
<div>I presume (based on what Mark has said previously) that the completed tasks are only being shown for our benefit - and are not part of the system.<br><br>It's fascinating then that Mark is doing all of this electronically. Looks like you could run the whole system within a single electronic note...or even a standard, simple task list as long as you can move the line up and down within it.</div>

<div>Good Morning Andreas H.<br>This is quite fun....given my options...*blush*....<br>This is precisely the reason I couldn't follow DIT.  I'm a great proponent of planning my weekly outcomes and that necessitates me ignoring the trivia while I'm focused on other work.  I'd go completely bonkers if I had to follow the dictates of random stuff streaming in to decide how I spend my limited resources.  Even before I was disabled and had a far more rigorous schedule (I lived out of my calendar for ambitious pursuits, competitions and social life  and totally off list for my pleasures and passions)  Even then, I ignored the trivia unless I had dead space time...(small units of time between important aims or events)  <br>Even though I was quite ambitious, my Bohemian spirit prevailed ultimately.  If it was important enough, it put on the calendar. If not, it had to wait until I had dead time.....and I was intent on having very little of that!  LOL!  <br>Perhaps, this is why I had such a hard time adjusting my lifestyle to my limitations....It's cruel folly for me to aim very high these days!  *blush*  My energy and attitude would be severly hampered if I had to chase down backlogs that were less than 3 days old!  LOL!<br><br>BTW.....how is your back healing?  I  sincerely hope that you are enjoying better times.<br>learning as I go</div>

<div>Learning, my back is doing fine. I have been painless for some weeks now. I'm really lucky there was no lasting damage. I feel a little guilty that I was so lucky when you were not. My best wishes go out to you.</div>

<div>Hi Andreas<br>Maybe he has to put it in the post to return it.....Netflix or an equivalent....my sister loves her Netflix.....I can't follow movies without backtracking them over and over.  My short term memory limitations can't hold the characters or plot!  *blush*  Therefore, I rarely attempt to watch a movie unless it seems like it would be worth hours and hours of effort to follow it.  The last one I watched was Johnny Cash's bio.  It was called "Walk the Line"....yes...it was worth it!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div>Fascinating! Better than a webcam, I'd say... ;-)<br><br>I suppose the dismissal rule will be that once you enter the backlog and find no task standing out in the first pass-though, you dismiss the whole backlog and draw the new divider line below the open list.<br><br>This is... awesome! Makes RAF looking old and clunky.</div>

<div>Hi Learning, must be something different, because he re-added it. Or he put it in an envelope and when he next comes to it, he'll put stamp on it or mail it.<br><br>Well, perhaps it's not the most important aspect to pay attention to. ;-)<br><br>Does the cycling through the backlog (what *do* you prefer to call it, Mark?) work like cycling through a page in AF1/Forward Mode? If you do a complete pass without actioning anything, you leave the backlog?</div>

Are you asserting that everything above today's italicized entries would become the new backlog?  <br>And what is the fate of the original backlog items?....or does it all become an even bigger lump or............scary thought..........the current backlog gets dismissed?<br>That sounds like lightening speed!  A mid day nap or an impromptu social visit could throw off the whole thing!  LOL!   WAY too fast for the like of me!  LOL!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div>p.s.  <br>You stated in another post:<br>"Does the cycling through the backlog (what *do* you prefer to call it, Mark?) work like cycling through a page in AF1/Forward Mode? If you do a complete pass without actioning anything, you leave the backlog?"<br><br>I would guess not....not having a consequence of not acting on it procedurally would be too willy nilly.....His recent blog posts and comments infer that he's incorporating more procedural discipline into the new system to ensure progress and prevent willful avoidance/neglect.<br>learning as I go</div>

<div>Hi Frank<br>I totally concur with your sentiments!.......but then again, he's working off his list from 8am to 11pm..................that's PLENTY of time to knock out quite a bit of work!  He has stated previously that he almost lives out of his list.  Therefore, it's hard for me to guess how he's thinking.  My goal is to get myself OUT of my list ASAP each day!

<div>I don't find this drastic. You might very well work on a backlog (=the part of the list ABOVE the divider line) several days. You just have to find anything in it to work on.<br><br>But "dismiss it if on the first pass no task stands out" would be a very AF-like rule.</div>

<div>Andreas,<br><br>I wonder if it would be more likely that a new backlog would not be declared until the next day.  That is what I would do.  I can't see including an item I just wrote on the bottom of the list a minute ago to be part of a "backlog".  But then, Mark has said he is not calling it a "backlog" so that may be why he might do something like that.  Sometimes terminology is king ;-)</div>

<div>@Matt,<br><br>Yes, you could use a "----" subject line separator but I've found from using AF1 on my Blackberry in the past that the closed list effect works much more effectively for me to have a reducing task list.

<div>Hi Frank,<br><br>Makes sense. I find it varies with me depending on screen size. The small BB screen gets too cluttered with done tasks. At work I run Outlook on a large monitor and the extra real-estate makes it comfortable to have completed tasks showing. Plus, strikethrough on Outlook completed tasks is more intuitive somehow.<br><br>So, I'm going for this new approach as well. At least I think I am from what's been posted so far. I assume I draw a line. Above the line I keep rotating thrugh AF1 style until nothing stands out. Then I parse below the line, once, before returning above the line.<br><br>Is that how everyone elses reads it?<br><br>Matt</div>

<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">AndreasE - 2009-09-4 14:02</div>
<div>I might be wrong, but in the moment, AF4 appears to be basically AF1 on a larger scale. (Which would explain the addictive effect... :-D)<br><br>Imagine doing AF1 with only 2 active pages, one of them being the last page (where you add new tasks and don't dismiss). Only difference: There is no limit in length. Page 1 is closed, that means, you can't add tasks anymore, you can only get tasks done. Page 2 is open, you can add to it. So, page 1 would be the first part of the list (the not-so-called "backlog"), and page 2 the second part.<br><br>I wonder how wrong I am...</div>

<div>Maybe we should just all agree to call the "not-backlog" list a "backlog" list for sanity's sake? :)<br><br>I can see why it isn't a true backlog (because potentially a newish task could end up there) but that list does get treated like a backlog (i.e. it gets isolated and then chipped away bit by bit) and it's going to get awfully confusing if we don't standardize on some terminology.</div>

<div>@Rainer,<br><br>My theory is that dismissal is not based on time for this system but on whether any items in the "backlog" list can be done or not. I'm guessing that if no items stand out at all, then all these items are put up for review and then dismissed on the next "backlog declaration".<br><br>So really there is no concept of "yesterday" for this approach...my deductions are based primarily on the fact that Mark started where he left off yesterday...and, of course, I could be completely wrong :)</div>

<div>A key issue regarding the workability of the new system is going to be the balance between the two lists (ie the one before the line and the one after it).  If the first list is so long that you do not often get to the second list you have a problem analogous to the one that some of us had with AF1 (ie not getting to the newest items often enough).  In the case of Mark's demonstration today, the first list is short enough that Mark can cycle round it several times and still get to the second list twice (?) so far today.</div>

<div>Mark, given that you are washing up again, I would say you are a very clean person. :-) I am sure I will like this latest approach, but it's a potential bummer for software developers working on AF. I wonder what would happen to all our productivity if we had a live audience watching. My audience would be thinking, "Good grief. She's still reading comments on Mark's blog. Get moving already." So I think I will. ;-)</div>

<div>@James T<br><br>If the "backlog" list is operated as an AF1 list in this new system then you would only need to do one item on it in order to move to the open list again - so length would not really be a major issue.</div>

<div>Frank,<br><br>Re: Sanity ;-)  I agree that terminology is important so we ought to pick our terms carefully.<br><br>At one point I said to myself: "Self, his backlog is nothing more than my "hot list"."  On further reflection that is not true at all.  While it may be that much of what is on the backlog is "hot", that does not correctly describe it.<br><br>Likewise, I think "backlog" is not right because some things there may be current.<br><br>I think when mark states his "rule" for drawing the line (especially drawing it next time) we will have more insight into what that line really MEANS.  Knowing that, we will be able to devise meaningful terminology (or perhaps Mark has already).<br><br>I'm happy to call it the (not) backlog list for now ;-)  Or we could call it the Ostrich list ... no, I prefer the Cat list ...

<div class="comment-meta">SteveB - 2009-09-4 15:10</div>
<div>@James<br><br>I agree in general - the balance will almost certainly be key - but I think it includes an important mechanism that AF1 lacked... namely the option to "shortcut-out" to the newer items.<br><br>What I mean is, suppose you are feeling time-pressured by a recently added or nearly-urgent item (or items), or even just by a nagging feeling there's "something you're missing" in the second part of the list:<br><br>In AF4, this is likely to reduce the extent to which items in part 1 feel ready to be done, so you're likely to swiftly switch to part 2. In AF1 however, unless you adopted a 'tweak', you would have to do at least something on at least one item on every page between where you were and the last page, which would likely be a lot slower.<br><br>It looks like a more easily managed approach to an idea I was just about to test for an AF1 tweak (having found myself with AF2 doing 'more', but primarily lots of repetitions of less important stuff like reading RSS feeds) - which was going to be the choice every time I moved to the next page of instead flipping to the last (or perhaps last but one) page and then returning to the 'real' next page after I reached the end.</div>

<div>Second version of what we think we know so far:<br><br>- Two lists (or list parts)<br>- First is a closed list (not) called "Backlog"<br>- - Is cycled through until nothing stands out<br>- - If nothing stands out:<br>- - - All items are put "on review"<br>- - - The "backlog line" is moved to the end of the second list making all of that a "backlog"<br>- - - All new items are added after the new line<br>- - - We don't yet know about dismissal<br>- Second is an open list<br>- - It is worked when nothing stands out from the first list<br>- - It is worked in only one pass then we return to the first list<br>- - Don't know about dismissal yet (I suspect there is no dismissal from the open list)<br><br>Waiting with baited breath for the dismissal rule ;-)</div>

<div>It seems we have all been taken by surprise (or me, at least <grin>) - the two list system is really a three list system.<br><br>We have "current", "backlog" (or not) and "review".<br><br>Looks like on the next "rotation" of lists...<br><br>1. "Review" will be dismissed<br>2. "Backlog" becomes "Review"<br>3. "Current" becomes "Backlog"<br>4. And anything new or repeated goes into "Current"<br><br>Simple and elegant.</div>

<div>Since you didn't have a task to "Review tasks up for review," was this triggered as a structured step in the process?</div>

<div>Mark, I think it's a language difference. When I read "wash up," I envision you washing your hands and possibly your face. Now if you had written "clean up" or "wash dishes" I would have seen you doing what you described.</div>

<div>AH HA ;-) <br><br>Do we have it all yet?  LOL ;-)  Here is what I see:<br><br>------<br><br>Summary of AF4 Rules<br><br>AF4 consists of two lists (or list parts)<br><br>- The first is a closed list called "Backlog" (for the moment)<br>- - It is cycled through until nothing stands out<br>- - If nothing stands out and something was "actioned" on this pass<br>- - - Move to the second list<br>- - If nothing was "actioned" on this pass<br>- - - All items are put "on review"<br>- - - The "backlog line" is moved to the end of the second list making all of that a "backlog"<br>- - - All new items are added after the new line<br>- - If nothing stands out in one pass of the "on notice" section<br>- - - Dismiss all "on notice" items<br>- - - Add back any that seem to want to be done to the end of the second list<br><br>- Second is an open list<br>- - It is worked when nothing stands out from the first list<br>- - It is worked in only one pass then we return to the first list<br>- - (I suspect there is no dismissal from the open list)<br><br>- The two lists are treated as one with regard to where one is in the processing, IOW, start tomorrow where you left off today.</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Sabrina - 2009-09-4 16:07</div>
<div>Interesting!<br><br>It looks like AF4 is the first system in where there is a structured review of 'dismissed' (highlighted) items - where they are rephrased and re-entered into the list right away OR deleted.<br><br>In previous systems, dismissed items could potentially stay around forever, and no decision was ever forced to be made on them.<br><br>That is some serious motivation. I think I like it.</div>

<div>Thanks Mike,<br>I think my brain must be fried because it's the end of a busy week. I basically meant I didn't understand any of the "Instructions as we know so far" but was curious about backlogs, which is my particular demon.... (Yes Mark, if you see this, I still haven't done that backlog from years ago!!!) so I think I will probably have to await the final reveal of the new AF4 at the end of today when Mark issues it. I hope he will do it in his own words as that might help me.<br><br>Kind regards,<br>Carol</div>

<div>AF4 = ABC METHOD<br><br>Looks like there are really three sections to the list:<br><br>1. Aside = tasks set Aside a.k.a. dismissed a.k.a. marked for review (highlighted)<br>2. Backlog = older closed list worked in multiple rounds<br>3. Current = new open list worked in single rounds</div>

<div>Regarding the "on notice" items, I think it would make sense to have an AF1 dismissal system for them as well.<br><br>Since they have previously not "stood out" (otherwise they would not be up for review), they would most likely all be dismissed immediately but there is always the chance that you might want to rescue a few of them and I think applying the AF1 rules would allow you to do so.<br><br>Not really clear to me either at the moment. :)</div>

<div>Frank,<br><br>You apply the AF1 rule to highlight them for review in the first place. The difference is that you don't get the option of NOT reviewing them at the next pass. They can be rescued by re-entering them on the main list, but only if you feel that they really belong there.</div>

<div>What do you you do with 'tasks' you want to do, but not immediately?  For example, I'm told of a book that I'd like to read but it's not like I'm planning to run right out and buy it.  I suppose I could stick "buy XXXX book" on the list right away, but then it would age into the 'backlog' list and then be dismissed and re-entered over and over and over.....   <br><br>Is there some subsidiary list where you keep 'pended' tasks?</div>

<div>Mike:<br><br>The review/dismissal rule is as follows:<br><br>If you do no tasks when you visit the first part of the list, then all tasks in the first part are put on notice for review and the line is drawn at the end of the second part so that the whole list becomes the new first part.<br><br>The next time you go to the beginning of the list, all tasks which are on notice for review are deleted. They may be re-entered (preferably re-phrased) or just dropped. So basically what happens is that you go through each task for review and decide what to do with it.</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Mike - 2009-09-4 20:10</div>
<div>Mark,<br><br>Ah, thanks for that.  Are the tasks deleted when you go to the first part straight away, or do you have the option to work on them before deleting them.  Just wondering why the delay of one list cycle before deleting ... IOW, you could have skipped the "on-review" step entirely and just deleted them if there is no time lapse to work on them.  Did I misunderstand?  (It happens ;-)<br><br>Oh, and just a technicality, perhaps.  Once you move the line to the end of the list, there is no SECOND part any longer.  You are in the first part straight away.  At least until you delete tasks and possibly re-add.</div>

<div>AF3 -> AF4 Startup Question:<br><br>I think I understand this new method (AF4). I've really liked AF3 (RAF), and would like to be lazy and just draw a line at the end, considering everything now in my notebook to be Backlog, and proceed with AF4 (rather than copying a lot of items or starting with a fresh notebook). So unless I enter several new tasks and work on some, I will get to the beginning of the Backlog almost immediately. In any case, I'll soon need to Review all highlighted tasks and delete/rephrase-reenter all of them before proceeding with non-highlighted Backlog tasks, right?</div>

<div>Well, for your fans, "closed" and "open" have meaning.  And to those who don't know you from Adam, I think you'd have to explain the concept in any case ... so maybe nothing is lost.

<div><<The next time you go to the beginning of the list, all tasks which are on notice for review are deleted.>><br><br>I think that means the highlighter is not essential anymore, is it? Its main purpose was to make a dismissed item scream: "hey, I've been dismissed! You can come back and delete me or rephrase me or whatever when you feel like reviewing your dismissed items."<br><br>Now, with the reviewing of dismissed tasks being ingrained in the system, I think highlighting might be superfluous. Unless, of course, one wants to highlight deleted items, and I can see why one would want to do that... But I am not sure I would want to.<br><br>By the way, I think "closed" and "open" to describe the two parts of the lists make a lot of sense.</div>

<div>I've got a question. At 14:52, you said "none of the tasks in the "backlog" stand out for action so I have marked them all up for review...At the same time I have drawn a line at the end of the list so that the whole current list becomes the "backlog." All new tasks will now go below this line." In the comments section Wooba asks:<br><br><< What is the rule for placing the line? >><br><br>Your answer is "It goes at the end of the whole list when the previous "backlog" is completed."<br><br>So my question is "completed backlog" = either finished all tasks or remaining tasks have been put up for review. <br><br>So it it is not necesssary to have carried out the review in order for the backlog to be finished?</div>

<div>Here is a cleaned up and updated version of the "rules" as I understand them.<br><br>=====<br><br>Summary of AF4 Rules<br><br>AF4 consists of two lists (or list parts)<br><br>- The first is a closed list called "Backlog" (for the moment ... it might later be called "Closed List")<br>- The second is an open list<br>- The two lists are treated as one with regard to where one is in the processing cycle. IOW, start tomorrow where you left off today.<br><br>The processing rules are as follows:<br><br>- The first ("Closed") list is cycled through repeatedly and items are actioned (if they stand out), or passed over<br>- - Actioned items are crossed out<br>- - - If there is more work to be done (or the task is repetitive, it is added to the end of the second list.<br>- - If something was actioned in this pass and nothing further stands out<br>- - - Move to the beginning of the second list and begin scanning/processing that list<br>- - If nothing was actioned in this pass of the first list<br>- - - All items are put "on review"<br>- - - The "backlog line" is moved to the end of the second list making all of that the new "backlog"<br>- - - All new items are added after the new "backlog line"<br>- - If (on the next pass of the first list, after returning from working on the second "Open" list) nothing stands out<br>- - - Dismiss all "on notice" items<br>- - - Add back any that seem to want to be done to the end of the second list (possibly rewording them<br><br>- The second ("Closed") list is processed in only one pass each time it is entered<br>- - It is processed only when nothing stands out from the first list<br>- - As with the first list, if an item is actioned it is crossed off and re-added to the end (of the second, open, list if there is more work to do or it is a repetitive item<br><br>=====<br><br>That is my best understanding so far.</div>

<div>Mike,<br><br>That's a great summary. The only part I am not sure about is this:<br><br>>>> - - If (on the next pass of the first list, after returning from working on the second "Open" list) nothing stands out<br>- - - Dismiss all "on notice" items<br>- - - Add back any that seem to want to be done to the end of the second list (possibly rewording them <<<<br><br>I don't think there is a concept of 'on notice' - here is my interpretation of the workflow to arrive at dismissed items:<br><br>1) If no items stand out in the closed list, you dismiss them all. <br>2) Draw the backlog line at the end of your open list, and it now becomes your closed list, and you work that until no items stand out. <br>3) When no items stand out in your closed list, do your one pass through the open list. <br>4) Return to the beginning of the list where the dismissed items, and either delete or re-enter them. <br>5) Keep going on to the closed list.<br>6) Go back to Step 1.<br><br>(insert favourite terminology for 'backlog', 'stand out', 'dismissed', etc)</div>

<div>Hi Mike and all the listathon audience!<br>WOWSERS!  I'm not even going to attempt to read all these comments......<br>Mike.....thank you for cracking the code!  LOL!  After looking at Mark's monolithic list, I think I'll stay with my easier brain damage friendly methods...........<br><br>Mark....if you added only 2 more hours, this would be an "official" 17hour crunch!  We'd do these during convention and publishing deadlines.  David, I hope you appreciate your medical illustration staff each time you get published! <br>Our methods were far kinder than Mark's non-stop listathon method.  We gave ourselves <br>4 15minute breaks and 2 30minute meals.  We'd have NEVER been able to go non-stop like Mark did today!  Mark, I'm highly impressed!  WELL DONE!  If we attempted 15 hours of illustrating in one go, I'd fear that our anatomical accuracy would have flown out the window and the charts, diagrams and schematics rendered utterly useless!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div>>>>  I don't think there is a concept of 'on notice'  <<<<br><br>From an earlier post by Mark:<br><br>=====<br>The review/dismissal rule is as follows:<br><br>If you do no tasks when you visit the first part of the list, then all tasks in the first part are put on notice for review and the line is drawn at the end of the second part so that the whole list becomes the new first part.<br><br>The next time you go to the beginning of the list, all tasks which are on notice for review are deleted. They may be re-entered (preferably re-phrased) or just dropped. So basically what happens is that you go through each task for review and decide what to do with it.<br>=====</div>

<div>Learning,<br><br>Welcome back ... now it is just about time to walk the dog and see the sunset! ;-)<br><br>I'm starting to "get" Mark ;-)  If you'll notice his list is mostly small chunks of things.  That is why it is humongous.  My list would be chunked higher so be shorter ... as I suspect would yours.  Mark really is "little and often" in his orientation ... to an extent I had not previously understood.  I think that accounts for a lot of our "crossed communications".  We are such very different people.  I could never watch 30 minutes of a movie.  That would destroy it for me ;-)<br><br>I'm not sure, but I think with the addition of my "hot list" I could make this system work and it might just work out better for me than what I'm doing now.  Dunno.  I've got to mull over this a bit ;-)</div>

<div>Hi Mike!<br>Today was so lovely that I took my beloved furrball on several walks today!  Sunsets get prettier in the autumn around here.  I'm looking forward to that.  Maybe the ocean air has something to do with it. For awhile, the ocean is actually warmer than some of the autumn days.<br>I barely glanced at the particulars of his list because my brain is like a sieve.  I read a list and it evaporates in my brain almost instantly.  Maybe it's because it's hard to cue up a list of random short phrases for my brain.  Like you, I find it easier to stay in a category of effort as opposed to jumping around.  Plus, it's far easier for me to work a short list & routine checklists I've grown more familiar with.  I'm a mess.  I like deciding and doing separate as much as possible unless it's learning/discovery time.  Working an AF list would probably blow a couple of my brain gaskets!  LOL!<br>What titilates you about today's new method to be worth experimenting yet again!  I finally stopped with that I hope.  I simply don't have the extra resources any more.  *blush*<br>I'd rather use that learning curve effort on something I have more interest in such as playing mad scientist in the kitchen!

<div>I don't think Mike and Sabrina are disagreeing — just using two different phrases — "put on notice for review" and "dismissal" to mean the same thing.<br><br>In the time honoured spirit of people criticising Mark's systems before trying them ("it's just a to-do list", etc!) I'd like to sound a pessimistic note and say: I don't see how this system is going to be a long-term improvement, because it weakens the "threat of dismissal" so much. After a few days my brain will learn that there's no real penalty to dismissing items, and thus I will leave the closed list area too readily, reducing the efficacy of the closed list area, and also adding to the overhead time spent rewriting and rewriting bits of the list.<br><br>This isn't really a criticism of Mark's work, though. I think NOVELTY is a huge reason why new systems seem better than old ones — the power of our brains to adapt is scarily great. I hereby predict that when all is said and done, the rules of the Ultimate Autofocus System will be as follows:<br><br>1. Every few weeks, switch the version of Autofocus that you're using.<br>The end.</div>

<div>Mike:<br><br>I think what Sabrina means is that whether you call it "on notice" or "on review", those tasks are not treated like "on notice" tasks in RAF.<br><br>Mark writes: << The next time you go to the beginning of the list, all tasks which are on notice for review are deleted >><br><br>You wrote: <<- - If (on the next pass of the first list, after returning from working on the second "Open" list) nothing stands out<br>- - - Dismiss all "on notice" items >><br><br>The problem is the "if" in your statement. Once the tasks are marked, they get deleted the next time.

<div>Mike:<br><br>Let me join in with my thanks for your excellent summaries.<br><br>Here's a question about this "on notice" bit. I know there was some talk earlier about the usefulness or not of a highlighter to denote things on notice. In this blogaversity that Mr. Forster is running today he couldn't highlight items, so they were put in brackets.<br><br>Does it make sense for us to highlight or mark items on notice at all? The way it looks at first glance is that every unactioned item above the FIRST line is on notice (you've already drawn a SECOND line, right?) When you come back around to the closed list the next time all of those items are dismissed or reentered at the end of the open list. Is that correct?<br><br>Is there any reason, besides Mr. Forster wanting to show us clearly what items were on notice for review, to highlight/mark the items?<br><br>--Joseph</div>

<div>Hey Learning,<br><br>>>>  Today was so lovely that I took my beloved furrball on several walks today!  <<<<br><br>YAY for you!  Honestly, I can't think of a better way to spend the day.<br><br>>>>  Sunsets get prettier in the autumn around here. I<<<<br><br>It is mostly the crap in the air that makes them so beautiful ;-)<br><br>>>>  'm looking forward to that. Maybe the ocean air has something to do with it. <br><br>AH, I don't think you've ever mentioned you lived near the ocean.  Yes, of course, it is the salt in the air.  Especially as the air gets colder, the air picks up more salt and that scatters the light more and makes for orange and red sunsets.<br><br>I envy you that.  I would like to live nearer the water or in the desert ... I love extremes ;-)<br><br>>>>  For awhile, the ocean is actually warmer than some of the autumn days.  <<<<br><br>Yes, and especially late in the day.  The water has all day to warm up and cools more slowly.  The land changes more quickly.  It is pretty funny how that all works.  When I would fly my tiny plane over the Chesapeak Bay in the warm of a Fall or early Spring day, I would hit a "bump" as I flew over the water ... the air over the water was stil colder and so it was like hitting a pot hole ;-)<br><br>>>>  I barely glanced at the particulars of his list because my brain is like a sieve. I read a list and it evaporates in my brain almost instantly. Maybe it's because it's hard to cue up a list of random short phrases for my brain.

I'm a mess.  <<<<br><br>Hey now, cut that out!  You're one of the most capable people around.  And don't even get me started on drive and positive attitude!<br><br>>>>   I like deciding and doing separate as much as possible unless it's learning/discovery time. Working an AF list would probably blow a couple of my brain gaskets! LOL!  <<<<br><br>LOL ;-)  I also thrive on habits, as you know.  That is why much of my lists would be higher order chunks.<br><br>>>>  What titilates you about today's new method to be worth experimenting yet again!  <<<<br><br>Oh, I can't resist playing with systems.  What I like about this is that he as actually managed to make it simpler than before.  I thought that RAF was going in the wrong direction ... getting more complicated.  This is much simpler and, with a tweak or two, would be even simpler still.<br><br>>>>  I finally stopped with that I hope. I simply don't have the extra resources any more. *blush*  I'd rather use that learning curve effort on something I have more interest in such as playing mad scientist in the kitchen! LOL!  <<<<br><br>I also love cooking.  My wife is of two minds about it ... MY cooking, that is.  On the one hand she loves that I do all the cooking.  On the other, she can't get my "experimenting" with food.  She would rather that I fix it the same way all the time.  Stuff and nonsense, I say.  Cooking is play.<br><br>I long ago forgot ... one day ... when I was younger and MUCH stupider ... I was cooking pasta.  I had read that it was good to put wine in the sauce.  I had no wine, unfortunately, but I DID have Creme de Menthe.  Need I say more?  OY, my dinner tasted like toothpaste!</div>

<div>AF4 in Brief<br><br>I'd like to offer a simpler description of the process. Of course, it doesn't have the detail Mike and Sabrina gave above. I'll use C ("Current") for open list #2, and B ("Backlog") for closed list #1.<br><br>Brief Autofocus 4 Instructions (assumed start at Current List)<br><br>1. Unicycle C, then multicycle B. Return to C after unproductive B cycle.<br><br>2. On return from C to B, cross out each highlighted task.<br><br>3. On unproductive initial B cycle, highlight all B tasks then close entire list. Continue to multicycle newly expanded B, skipping highlighted tasks.<br><br>I think that covers the entire strategy, other than the details we already know how to do (e.g. choosing what "stands out"; deciding which highlighted items to re-enter and re-word, etc.).</div>

<div>Joseph,<br><br>I'm guessing not.  In fact, as I mentioned to Mark, putting items on notice is actually redundant as well.  He wants just that little bit of time lag to have his subconscious process that those tasks are about to be deleted.  But I think they could be dispatched straight away.  Once you did nothing on a pass, copy the items you want to save and draw a big X through the whole bit and move on.</div>

<div>Mike,<br><br>Thanks. I'm glad my question made sense. So you are in agreement that whether or not you have that additional subconscious processing time, it isn't necessary to denote items on notice for review because EVERY unactioned item above the first line will be on notice for review?Therefore the first line acts as the marker for on notice items.<br><br>Turning to your discussion with Mr. Forster regarding deleting right off instead of putting item "on notice" and then dealing with them the next time you are in the closed list: I'm fascinated by Mr. Forster's consistent consideration of the power of subconscious processing. I think with all his experience in this area he must be on to something. It seems to be one of the hallmarks of the AF system regardless which version.<br><br>It makes sense to me. Once you know that everything above the line is on notice, and that the next time you stop by they will be sorted into a delete pile and a rephrase-reenter pile, perhaps you start parallel processing which items aren't ripe, and why certain items are getting done, and how to rephrase items so they will be done. Next time you are there all of this has been subconsciously mulled over and the delete/reenter choice might be made intuitively and quicker in the long run.<br><br>Just a guess.<br><br>--Joseph</div>

<div>Andreas spotted an error in my previous version.  (Thanks Andreas).  Rule numbered 1.4 has been changed to reflect Andreas' correction.<br><br>Here is a cleaned up and updated version of the "rules" as I understand them.  I numbered the "rules" so as to make it easier to reference them.  I also introduced the idea of the "third list" just because someone brought it up and it might merit some discussion.  Since it is probably very very transient, I doubt it figures into things very much.<br><br>=====<br><br>Summary of AF4<br><br>The AF4 list structure -- AF4 consists of two lists (or list parts)<br><br>- The first is a closed list called "Backlog" (for the moment ... it might later be called the "Closed List")<br>- Second is an open list<br>- The two lists are treated as one with regard to where one is in the overall processing cycle. IOW, start tomorrow where you left off today.<br><br><br>[NOTE: There is possibly a third list, of a transient nature, which results from marking all tasks on the first list as "on notice for dismissal", moving the "line" to the end of the second list, and then adding new tasks after that line ... thus resulting in the temporary creation of the third list.  This third list is quickly deleted when, on the next pass, all "on notice items are deleted.  See the processing details for more information.]<br><br><br>The rules for processing AF4 are as follows:<br><br>1. The first ("Closed") list is cycled through repeatedly and items are actioned (if they stand out), or passed over<br>1.1. Actioned items are crossed out<br>1.1.1. If there is more work to be done (or the task is repetitive), it is added to the end of the second list.<br><br>1.2. If something was actioned in this pass and nothing further stands out<br>1.2.1. Move to the beginning of the second list and begin scanning/processing that list<br><br>1.3. If nothing was actioned in this pass of the first list<br>1.3.1. All items are put "on review"<br>1.3.2. The "backlog line" is moved to the end of the second list making all of that the new "backlog"<br>1.3.3. All new items are added after the new "backlog line"<br><br>1.4. On the next pass of the first list, after returning from working on the second "Open" list<br>1.4.1. Dismiss all "on notice" items<br>1.4.2. Add back any that seem to want to be done to the end of the second list (possibly rewording them)<br><br>2. The second ("Open") list is processed in only one pass each time it is entered<br>2.1. It is processed only when nothing stands out from the first list<br>2.2. As with the first list, if an item is actioned it is crossed off and re-added to the end (of the second, open, list) if there is more work to do or it is a repetitive item<br><br>=====<br><br>That is my best understanding so far.  I'm sure there are more errors, so ...  ;-)</div>

<div>Here's my take on AF v4 - sorry if it seems to be repetitious, but it helps my clarity.<br><br>AF 4 is a simple task management system to keep track of things that need to be done, in the very near future.  This system does not incorporate project management, routines or other items more easily handled by a calendar or checklist.  The list easily manages reference these items. <br><br>The entire list is considered to be a whole.  The whole is divided into two parts – open and closed.  They are separated by a line.  Above the line is the closed list, Below the line is an open list.  They have different tactics to operate them effectively.<br><br>Above the Line – Closed List<br>- Cycle through this list over and over until there seems to be nothing further to do right now. <br>– Move to below the line.<br><br>Below the Line – Open List<br>- Do only one pass of the open part of the list continue through to the bottom, then head immediately back to the Closed section.<br><br>- Process the Closed list as above (over and over until there seems to be nothing further to do).  At this point, before heading below the line, mark all unfinished tasks with a highlighter, as being on review.  <br><br>- Then proceed to the very bottom of the list.  Draw a line to mark this section of the list closed.  All new tasks now go below this line.<br><br>- Carry on through the new “Closed” section until there appears to be nothing further to action at this time.<br><br>- Do another single pass through the open part of the list, continue through to the bottom, then head back to the “On Review- Highlighted” section.<br>When you reach this section, either delete the items in this section, or rewrite/rephrase them in the “Open” section of the list.  The task is obviously not going to be carried out now, for whatever reason, so it’s time to let it go.<br><br>Now start to work thorough the “Closed Section” as at the first part, “over and over until there seem to be nothing further to do right now”.<br><br>Do one pass of the “Open” part of the list, then carry on back to the “Closed” Section, proceed as aforementioned.<br><br><br>At the end of the day, mark where you stopped working on the list, as a place to start in the morning, and work through the list again.<br><br><br>Having stumbled badly through v2 and v3(RAF), I can see how this one might work well for me.  It's actually most like the original AF, which I did find to be the best of the bunch.</div>

<div>The squarespace software included the comma in David's link, this one works: <a href="../blog/The Simplest Time Management Method.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2008/11/17/the-simplest-time-management-method.html</a><br><br>[Thanks, Andreas. I've corrected David's link. Mark]<br><br>The similarities are really interesting. AF4 is like a combination of AF1 and this method.</div>

<div>DavidC and Andreas:<br><br>Yes, you're right. There is a very definite resemblance which is not coincidental.<br><br>However that system had several major drawbacks:<br><br>1) It didn't handle urgent items at all well.<br><br>2) Recurring tasks have different desirable frequencies. You probably want to clear your email more frequently than you have a Spanish lesson. If you've got three books and two movies on your list, do you really want to have to deal with all five of them before you can wash the dishes again?<br><br>3) Because you ended up with a chunk of difficult items with no way out, it tended to build up resistance to the list as a whole. So there was a big tendency to avoid working on the list.<br><br>So, yes, it was definitely part of my thinking along the way. But I had to work through several other ideas before I was able to solve these drawbacks.</div>

<div>I'm going to close these comments now. Otherwise this discussion will lose its character as an immediate reaction to the unfolding of AF4. You are as always welcome to carry on the discussion in another thread.</div>
