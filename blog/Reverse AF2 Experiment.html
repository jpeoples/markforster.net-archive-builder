<h1>Reverse AF2 Experiment</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2020-02-15 18:17</div>
<div class="content"><p>I’m going to try the experiment of alternating between AF2 and Reverse AF2.</p>
<p>In the past I’ve done this by starting scans alternately from the end and the beginning of the list. However I’ve found this constant oscillation between the end and the beginning rather detrimental to keeping my attention consistent.</p>
<p>So what I’m going to do initially is that during the even hours (8 am, 4 pm, midnight, etc.) I will scan from the end of the list (i.e. AF2) and during odd hours (9 am, 1 pm, 5pm) I will scan from the beginning of the list.</p>
<p>I could also try odd/even days (1st of month etc) or weeks (week 11 of the year). I doubt if it’ll be necessary to try odd/even months or years!</p>
<p>It’s now 18:17 according to my computer - an even hour - so I’m going to be using AF2 scanning for the next 43 minutes.</p></div>

<div>I like this idea. Always enjoyed AF3, but having an item "switch mode to forward scanning"on the list was not ideal as it did not stand out (at least for me). Working with odd and even hours sounds like a nice balance</div>
