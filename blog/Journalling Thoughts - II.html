<p>Since writing a couple of days ago about <a href="/display/ShowJournal?moduleId=817806&currentPage=2">changing my method of journalling</a>, I’ve had a few further thoughts.</p><p>I suppose one of the reasons I would prefer to write in 10 minute bursts is simply that my attention span is limited. Thirty five minutes is a long time to be writing continuously without stopping to think. That is how long it took me to write the three pages that I have been doing up to now, and that is probably why I have found it difficult to keep going consistently. That amount of writing continuously has a lot of resistance attached to it.</p><p>I think splitting the journaling into ten minute bursts will work just fine. And what does it matter if I only do one or two bursts during the day, instead of all three? The aim is to get ideas for the blog and for life in general. This blog can’t exist without a constant flow of new ideas - and neither for that matter can I!</p></div>

<div>I have tried your time burst technique on  journalling.... thanks for the great idea. However, my experience has been that good ideas begin to flow only on the third page, after you have indulged yourself in the first two pages in a stream of consciusness writing....a break of one minute, as you suggest, breaks the chain of thought.  <br><br>Mark.... just an idea .... why not write a sequel to your "How to make dreams come true?" I believe it is a masterpiece .... other books in the market are just pale imitations.<br><br>Thanks</div>

<div>Hi, Vijay<br><br>You are probably right about there being a big difference between the two types of journalling. However what I intend to find out is whether the 10-minute burst method also produces useful results.<br><br>I'd love for more people to have read How to Make Your Dreams Come True. People either seem to love it or hate it - see the very mixed reviews on amazon.co.uk.</div>

<div>I really don't understand the reaction of some people to this book. This is one book that brings together so many different aspects (strands) of self-development in an easy, readable and useable form - vision, focus on current reality, employing the tension between the two to attain your vision, focusing on the positive and the best of all self-coaching through an interaction between our present and future selves. (Pavlina talks about it in one of his posts "My Favorite Meditation".)<br><br>I can tell you that when I began using the suggested regimen, I thought I was moving forward on all the aspects of my life - physical, spiritual and financial. It was so exhilirating !!<br><br>It is true that adhering to the regimen requires lots of discipline but it works. Lack of discipline was one reason why I have not been practicing it regularly. or maybe I was doing too much.... like making small changes in my vision every day to make it more attractive etc .<br><br>Maybe in your sequel, you could give more examples of crafting one's vision and developing techniques of  remaining steadfast to it.<br><br>T</div>

<div>Hi, Vijay<br><br>I make the point in the book that one can reduce the intensity once your vision is progressing. The greatest effort is in order to get the vision established in your mind.</div>
