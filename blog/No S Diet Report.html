<h1>"No S Diet" Report</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2006-11-3 9:37</div>
<div class="content"><p>I weighed myself this morning and found that I had lost 7 lbs in all. This is exactly the same as when I weighed myself last a couple of weeks ago. To be fair, I had an exceptionally heavy weekend at the end of last week - with a wedding, a family lunch party and two visits to a restaurant with friends. Since they all were on "S Days" the rules didn't apply.  My life isn't usually anything like as social as that, so I don't normally go mad at weekends. If it hadn't been for that exceptional two days I might well have lost another one or two pounds.</p><p>Excuses of course are what dieting is all about - but the great thing about this diet is that I don't have to feel guilty about last weekend because I had in fact stuck to the rules. </p><p>My original intention was not to weigh myself until the month was up. If I'd kept to that intention, I would have been delighted that I'd lost 7 lbs in a month. As it is the delight is muted by the knowledge that all the loss happened at the start.</p><p>This is not intended to be a quickie diet. It is there for the long-term so I intend to stick to it. I've found it easy to keep to, and the results so far have been good. I'll do some follow-up reports to show how I get on.</p><p>You can read all about the "No S Diet" at <a href="http://www.nosdiet.com/"><font style="color: #0072bc" color="#0072bc">www.nosdiet.com</font></a> </p></div>

<div>Look on the bright side - with all the socializing, you'd probably have gained if you weren't doing this!<br><br>(BTW, I found the No-S from your first post - it's been working very well for me. Thanks!!!!)</div>
