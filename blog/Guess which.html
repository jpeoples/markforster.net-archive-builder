<h1>Guess which?</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2017-02-14 15:26</div>
<div class="content"><p>For the last few days I’ve been resurrecting an old method and getting really good results from it. I know some of you like playing the detective, so here are some clues. Can you identify the method?</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>It uses a full “catch-all” list</li>
<li>It’s not one of the Autofocus, Superfocus, FV, or FVP based methods</li>
<li>Any task can be accessed immediately</li>
<li>It does not use any form of random selection</li>
<li>There is no pre-selection - only one task is selected at a time.</li>
<li>New tasks can be added at any time</li>
<li>There is no “dismissal” of tasks</li>
<li>Unfinished and recurrent tasks are re-entered immediately</li>
<li>Selection is fast and easy</li>
<li>It is very responsive to circumstances, time of day, etc</li>
<li>No need to have separate lists for work, office, home, etc.</li>
<li>The list is treated as one whole - no pages involved.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>I’ve never really given this method a fair trial in the past. I think this is because I’ve made the mistake of starting it on an already long list. This time I started with a list of only ten tasks and let the list grow of its own accord. At the moment my list is 69 tasks long and the method is still working well.</p></div>

<div>DWM or DWM2 ?</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Seraphim - 2017-02-14 16:51</div>
<div>I was thinking DWM also, but then remembered how things roll off the waterfall after 30 days, which is arguably a kind of dismissal. <a href="../blog/DIT2 AF5 Who cares what it's called This is what I'm working on at the moment....html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2010/2/1/dit2-af5-who-cares-what-its-called-this-is-what-im-working-o.html</a></div>

<div>I was also thinking it could be DIT, but DIT is page-based. Hmmm...</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Seraphim - 2017-02-14 16:55</div>
<div>(And if it were DIT, Mark would not have started it with a long list, nor would he have said he had never given it a fair trial!)</div>

<div>I think at the time that Mark drew a distinction between the time based expiry date and the process based dismissal. In line with his current thinking of letting things go if they're not "active" my money is on DWM2 given that it's a list based system.</div>

<div>I'm guessing it's 'The Same Old Thing'.</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Seraphim - 2017-02-14 19:59</div>
<div>Hm, I don't think it can be "The Same Old Thing," because that system doesn't allow you to jump wherever you want in the list. So not every task is immediately accessible.<br><br><a href="../blog/How to Do The Same Old Thing.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2016/12/27/how-to-do-the-same-old-thing.html</a></div>

<div>Michael B - As much as I like those systems, they have the same problem—they don't meet the criterion, "Any task can be accessed immediately."</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Michael B. - 2017-02-14 21:57</div>
<div>Seraphim:<br><br>Yes, agreed. I was thinking the same thing. However, in the comments section there appeared to be talk of jumping directly to a group of tasks out of order when needed, and Mark wrote that urgent tasks may be selected and done immediately. It seems like a perfect match otherwise though, don't you think?</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Michael B. - 2017-02-14 22:53</div>
<div>Now I'm really curious what it could be! I've scoured all the catch-all systems listed in the "TM Systems" section. It leads me to believe it may be one not listed there. Perhaps it's from Mark's book "Get Everything Done"?<br><br>So far I think we've established that it's not:<br><br>• Any Autofocus-based system<br>• Any FV-based system<br>• Any Random-based system<br>• DWM (Day, Week, Month)<br>• DWM 2 (Day, Week, Month 2)<br>• Any No-List system<br>• DIT (Do It Tomorrow) <br>• Spinning Plates<br>• Colley's Rule and the Resistance Principle<br>• Jefferson Nickel (Autofocus-based)<br>• Predictive To Do List<br>• A Simple and Powerful Method<br><br>And it doesn't seem likely to be:<br><br>• The Same Old Thing<br>• The Georgette Heyer Task Management System<br>• ASEM</div>

<div>Caibre65:<br><br><< Directional Open List ? From the May 2016 newsletter.>><br><br>Not a bad guess. But not the correct answer. <br><br>The correct answer has a higher score for the following clues:<br><br>- It is very responsive to circumstances, time of day, etc<br>- No need to have separate lists for work, office, home, etc.</div>

I'm no longer ruling out resistance-guided systems:<br><br>"Resistance varies with the time of day and circumstances. It's not just a matter of doing the most unpleasant task first. What you may be resisting at any given time may be something simple like hanging up your coat rather than leaving it lying around. Or it may be to take some rest or leave the office on time."<br><br>October 6, 2010 at 23:19 | Mark Forster</div>

<div>Is it your notebook idea?

All this can be done without disturbing the linear chronological format of the notebook. A side benefit of this is that there is no need to have separate lists for work and personal. <br><br>This is becoming the complete time management system that some people have been asking for."</div>

<div>I'd forgotten about a lot of these systems myself - in fact I had to look up several to make sure that they weren't in fact the one I'm using.<br><br>I'm spending the day today with the grandchildren, but will reveal the secret as soon as I get back to the list.</div>
