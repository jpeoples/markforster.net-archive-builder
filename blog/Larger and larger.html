<h1>Larger and larger</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2011-08-28 11:58</div>
<div class="content"><p>When you start working on a to do list it has a natural tendency to get larger and larger.</p>
<p>It even happened to God. On Day 1 His to do list was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create light </li>
</ul>
<p>By Day 6 His list was :</p>
<ul>
<li>Create cattle</li>
<li>Create creeping things</li>
<li>Create beasts of the earth</li>
<li>Create man</li>
<li>Create woman</li>
<li>Bless the above</li>
<li>Issue instructions about food</li>
<li>Review progress so far</li>
<li>Plan day off tomorrow</li>
</ul>
<p>So the phenomenon of the expanding to do list is nothing new. It has been with us right from the beginning.</p>
<p>I became very aware of this when yesterday I transferred my existing to do lists into the <strong>final version</strong> of my new time management system. It was “to do lists” in the plural because over the last few months of frantic testing I had accumulated a whole raft of them - with many duplicate items. So my first task in implementing the final version was to consolidate everything and remove the duplicates. Apart from the duplicates I did no editing at all because I wanted to give the new system plenty of work to do. It is designed to have anything and everything thrown at it - so I gave it anything and everything that I had.</p>
<p>I ended up with just under a hundred tasks, which is not too bad. The worrying thing though was that no less than<em> forty</em> of them were supposed to be done at least once a day. Although some of these were the sort of task that only takes a few seconds to do (“Check diary”, “Share price index”), others were altogether more substantial (“Go for long walk”, “French Vocabulary”). So this list badly needs weeding.</p>
<p>One of the selling points of the new system is “Tasks are sifted and filtered by working the system itself”. A list of forty daily tasks will challenge that to the full. I am hoping (and expecting) that the system will narrow my focus without losing the things which are really important to me. Actually I expect it to do more than that - I expect it to <em>tell</em> me what things are really important to me. At the moment I feel like someone clearing out an attic (“Oh, I can’t <em>possibly</em> throw that away - that was given to me by Aunt Myrtle”)</p></div>

<div>Mark, This seems like an amazing system... sure to handle everything.  Perhaps, you could even make a case/receive for a "Divine" endorsement.  :-)</div>
