<h1>Taking the Easy Choice</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2012-01-20 14:56</div>
<div class="content"><p>You have to make a very difficult call to an unsatisfied customer. Do you:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">a) make the call?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">b) tidy your desk?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">c) play a game on your iPhone/computer?</p>
<p>If your normal response to a situation like this is a) then you don’t need to read this post, except perhaps to wonder what on earth the problem is supposed to be.</p>
<p>If you normally go for b) then you usually take the easy choice, and it would be a good idea to learn to strengthen your choice muscle.</p>
<p>If c) would be your reaction, then you are not just taking the easy choice - you are withdrawing from the game altogether. You badly need to make stronger choices.</p>
<p>One of the most common characteristics of bad time managers is that they have a definite tendency to take the easy choice.</p>
<p>Taking the easy choice results in things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reluctance to go outside one’s comfort zone</li>
<li>Procrastination</li>
<li>Proliferation of busy work</li>
<li>Difficulty in taking decisions where there<em> is</em> no easy choice</li>
<li>Making excuses</li>
<li>Falling into the <a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/home/">activity trap</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This is something that can improve with training. And it’s well-worth doing. Strengthening one’s ability to take the more difficult choice will make a lot of difference in life.</p></div>

<div>I have a tendency to (b) and (c), which I strive to overcome.  I'm also likely in this example to<br>(d) Think through the details of the conversation and what I can say.</div>

<div>I would choose b) and c) until I really had to do a). I would love to strengthen my choice muscle, any ideas on how please? I've a sneaky feeling I might take the easy option though.</div>
