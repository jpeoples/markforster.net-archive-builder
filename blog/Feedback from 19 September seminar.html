<h1>Feedback from 19 September seminar</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2007-10-23 16:50</div>
<div class="content"><p>Here is the feed-back from the 19th September one-day “Do It Tomorrow” seminar:</p><p>“I have a much better understanding of the process and procedures having been on the course. I found the team sessions and inter discussions very informative.” <br><strong>Alister Mc Kinnon Clark</strong></p><p>“Practical, step-by-step solutions to get back on track and keep all my business and personal commitments.”<br><strong>Scott Allison, Access Business Communications, <a href="http://www.callabc.co.uk/">www.callabc.co.uk</a></strong></p><p>“Excellent exploration of the principles and how to make them work effectively in one’s own context/role/environment.”<br><strong>Nick Garring</strong></p><p>“Very helpful to recap on the book and to share ideas and difficulties with other people who have read/written the book. It’s now down to <em>me</em> to implement and I am pleased that the day has given me fresh motivation to continue.”<br><strong>Jackie Brazier</strong></p>

    <p>Since writing the above, I have received the following email from <strong>Alister Mc Kinnon Clark</strong>:</p><p>Good Morning Mark </p><p>Thank you for the Seminar on Friday which I thoroughly enjoyed, and more importantly found very useful. I am very determined to work on and install the principles. </p><p>I already have a tidy desk and am working on one thing at a time and have minimized my interruptions using some of the techniques we learned on Friday. </p><p>I found the depth that we explored time management very refreshing and quite different to many of the courses that I have been on, this has enabled me to see where I can more effective and also more productive. I thought the number of people attending the course was a great balance and that their input and sharing of ideas was interesting and helpful. </p><p>I look forward to implementing more of the processes in the next few weeks and reaping the rewards by retaining my sanity. </p><p>Kind regards </p><p>Alister </p>
