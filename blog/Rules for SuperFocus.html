<div class="content"><p><span style="font-size: 90%;"><em>SuperFocus is a very simple but effective method of processing your work. You write everything you have to do in a long list in a notebook. As you think of more things you add them to the end of the list. <br></em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 90%;"><em>Then you start at the beginning of the list and keep circulating round the first page, working on the tasks until you have worked on as many as you want to. Then you move on to the next page and do the same. Once you have got to the end of the list, you go back to the beginning, and start again at the first page.   <br></em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 90%;"><em>On each page there is a second column on which you can add additional tasks, as follows:   <br></em></span></p>
<ul>
<li style="color: black;"><span style="font-size: 90%;"><em>When you are      working on a page, you can add any urgent tasks to that page. </em></span></li>
<li style="color: black;"><span style="font-size: 90%;"><em>If you work on      a task and don’t finish it, then you re-enter the task on the next page.</em></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 90%;"><em>An important rule is that you can’t leave a page before working on all the tasks in Column 2. <br></em></span></p>

<p>SuperFocus is an advanced but simple time management system, which aims to give the best possible balance between  easy and difficult tasks and urgent and non-urgent tasks. It also makes sure that you finish what you have started.</p>
<p>The system uses a ruled notebook with two columns on a page. If you can’t fit two columns into your page, you can use facing pages instead.</p>
<p>The two columns work differently:</p>
<p><em>Column 1</em></p>
<p>All tasks are entered initially in the left-hand column (Column 1) (unless they are urgent).</p>
<p>The list in Column 1 runs continuously from page to page.</p>
<p><em>Column 2</em></p>
<p>Is exclusively for urgent and unfinished tasks</p>
<p><span class="full-image-block ssNonEditable"><img src="/storage/SuperFocus%20Notebook.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1297343989252" alt=""><span class="thumbnail-caption" style="width: 450px;">SuperFocus Notebook</span></span></p>
<p><strong>HOW TO WORK THE SYSTEM</strong></p>
<p>Take your notebook<br><br>Leaving room for a second column, write a list of everything you have to do down the left of the page, one task to a line.</p>
<p>Continue onto further pages as necessary, using only the left side of the page.</p>
<p>Add further tasks as you think of them or as they come up.</p>
<p>Start work on page 1 by considering each task in turn until one of them feels ready to be done. Work on it for as long as you feel like it. When you have finished working on it, take the following action:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>if the task is finished</em>, delete it by striking it through with a horizontal line. If it is a recurring task, re-enter it at the end of your list in Column 1.</li>
<li><em>if the task is not finished</em>, delete it in the same way. Re-enter it in Column 2 on the next page. If you are on the last page, then go back to the beginning of the list and re-enter the task in Column 2 of the first active page. If there is no room in Column 2, then re-enter it on the first page on which there is room.</li>
</ul>
<p>Enter urgent tasks in Column 2 of the page you are currently working on. If there is no more room in Column 2, then enter it on the first page on which there is room.</p>
<p>Continue working in the same way by circulating around the first page until no more tasks feel ready to be done. All tasks in column 2 must be worked on before you can move to a new page.</p>
<p>Continue circulating round page 1 until all tasks in column 2 have been worked on and no more tasks in column 1 feel ready to be worked on. To clarify: you do not have to work on all the tasks in Column 1 but you do have to work on all the tasks in Column 2.</p>
<p>Move to the next page and continue to act in the same way.</p>
<p>Once you have reached the end of the list, go back to the beginning.</p>
<p>When there are no active tasks remaining on a page, the page is finished and is no longer part of the active list. This rule does not apply to the last page. Note that Column 2 does not have to be full. In the above photo the left-hand page is completed. The wiggly line at the bottom of Column 2 is to stop accidental entry of further tasks into Column 2.</p>
<p><strong>Dismissal</strong></p>
<p>Dismissal is an important process for weeding out tasks that are not going anywhere.</p>
<p>There are two occasions on which tasks are dismissed:</p>
<p>1. If no tasks are done in Column 1 during a visit to a page, all  remaining tasks in Column 1 are dismissed. This rule does not apply to  the last page of the list.</p>
<p>2. When you visit a page which is full (i.e. both Column 1 and Column 2 are full), all Column 1 tasks on that page must be either actioned or dismissed.</p>
<p>Dismissal only applies to tasks in Column 1. Tasks in Column 2 must always be be worked on.</p>
<p>Dismissal is where the system finally gets rid of all the items which the system has sifted and found  wanting. This may happen very quickly (for instance if you have entered a  long list of books you are thinking of reading), but more usually quite  slowly. <br><br>These tasks are no longer active, but subject to review. It is a good idea to have a recurring task on your list called “Review Dismissed Tasks”. On review you should consider carefully why they were  rejected, whether they really need to be done at all, whether the time  is ripe for them to be done, whether they distract from your main goals,  and any other factors. When you do re-enter a dismissed item, it is  often a good idea to break it down or re-phrase it in some way. <br><br>Highlighting rejected items helps you to review them easily.<br><br>Remember that the dismissal rules do not apply to the page on which you are still writing items (i.e. the last page).</p>
<p><strong>Signs and symbols</strong></p>
<p>a. When a task has been actioned, it is crossed out with a horizontal line.</p>
<p>b. When a task is dismissed it is highlighted.</p>
<p>c. When a dismissed task is reviewed and either reinstated or removed  altogether, it is crossed out as it is no longer subject to review.</p>
<p>d. A page which has no active tasks left on it is marked with a cross in the outside upper corner.</p>
<p>e. When there are no active tasks left on any previous pages, the cross is surrounded with a circle.</p>
<p>f. When there are no dismissed tasks still subject to review on any previous pages, the circle is highlighted.</p></div>

<div>Thank you so much!  I tried to write my own "rules" using the instructions for AF1 and the superfocus v. 3 revisions, and mine weren't very clear at all.  This helps a great deal.</div>

<div>Mark, I didn't see an explanation that when you're on the last active page, the "next" page is the first active page. (A corrollary of that is that you always start a new page in column 1.) I was reading the rules from the point of view of someone seeing these systems for the first time.</div>

<div>Will instructions or guidelines be forthcoming on how to manage work tasks vs home tasks. For example, let us say that I am at home and on a page with column 2 tasks for home on it that I do not complete (but I have not finished working that page in the "home" context), and then I go to work and need to move to another page in the "work" context. Do I mark the page I was on in "home" context and return to it when I am back home?  Do I do some other type of recording or shifting of tasks? Do I simply maintain two separate lists? What is the judgment of the collective experience on this issue? Thanks in advance.</div>

<div>Mark:<br><br>My recommendation is to have a separate list for each location. This obviously may need to be adapted to people's individual circumstances.<br><br>There's an interesting post by Seraphim about how he overcomes this problem at <a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/1398586#post1400268" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1398586#post1400268</a></div>

<div>Mark, thank you so much for all your work. Love the new system. It addressed some of the issues I was experiencing using AF1 or AF4. Quick question... let's say that I begin a task which is urgent, entering that task in Col 2 on the page I am currently working on. I work on it for  an hour, but the task ends up taking longer than expected (writing a long report that is due in a couple of days). I cross it out to show that I worked on it, but where do I re-enter that task? Col. 2 on the next page because it is unfinished, or, Col. 2 on the same page because it is still urgent?</div>

<div>Alan, <br><br>thanks, that's a bit better. <br><br>But the results still aren't really satisfying. The text still is a quite small strip in the middle, and there are still some lines missing between pages (or even entire pages, Firefox is especially prone to this problem). <br><br>The results via text editor are rather ugly, and need quite a bit of additional editing, though. <br><br>I seem to remember that those problems didn't exist some two or three years ago when one tried to print a page, even without a special printer-friendly layout. IMO, there were some changes which broke printing. <br><br>Regards, <br>Alex</div>

<div>In some previous versions of AF, I seem to recall that each day you start with page 1 and work forward. How does that work with SF3? What if I end the day with items still in Column 2 on some other page?<br><br>I can easily see a couple of options<br><br>(1) Start on the page on which you ended. This requires you to read through all the earlier pages so you can note which earlier items may need action today. May cause earlier items to be delayed even longer.<br>(2) Move all unactioned items from the "current" Column 2 to Column 2 of day 1. Requires copying, but otherwise seems reasonable.<br><br>Suggestions?</div>

<div>Agree with Mark.  If however you really like starting on page 1, you can tell yourself not to quit until you finish the last page.</div>

<div>Just to be clear: If I have two active pages, and I action a task that is in column two of the last page, but there is still more work to be done, do I re-enter the task in column two of the *first* page, or do I start a new page and put the task in column two of the new page?</div>

<div>This feels like a truly great System. It feels like a smoothly flowing dual carriageway. There seems to be so much fluidity. I don't feel 'penned' in as in other systems I've used (in particular GTD and DIT).<br><br>Early indications are that this system fit me very well and I cannot see any reason  to change it. <br><br>Easily your best effort yet Mark!</div>

<div>Alan:<br><br><< I said to keep working to the end of the list.

During the time you are working on pp. 1-5, you may need to put tasks into their Column 2s. These will slow you down, so you may not make it to p. 6 at all if it's a short day or you have a lot of meetings.<br><br>Start again the following day at the beginning. At the end of yesterday's work you already have Column 2 tasks spread over 4 pages. Some of these have seen no action for over a day.

<div>You misread me then.  Ending the day on page 6 is NOT working to the end of the list.  If the list has 7 pages, I suggest stopping only after page 7.  Page 1 will have the column 2s.  Then page 1 is the next page, and you'll get to it in the morning.</div>

<div>Dear Mark,<br><br>Thank you very much for the SuperFocus instructions. However, I'm unsure how to apply SuperFocus to my specific situation. I'm a student and usually have to write three essays a week, as well as complete the set reading. Now, when I have an essay due (every couple of days), and have completed some work on the essay, I assume that I’ll add ‘write essay’ to the second column on the following page (if it's, say, two days before the deadline). Then, on the penultimate day of the deadline, if I still haven't finished the essay, I'll keep adding it to the second column on the first page, because completion of the essay will then become urgent.<br><br>However, the system, as I understand it, doesn’t help me to decide how much time I need to allot for each stage of the essay-writing process: interpreting the question, reading for the assignment, writing, editing, etc. So I assume I’ll need another system for planning the writing process. Do you know of another system that will work well with SuperFocus to help me manage (i.e. break down and organise) the writing process? My fear is that, by just using Super Focus, I’ll still have bad time management.<br><br>Finally, does SuperFocus work well if, like me, you only have two or three main tasks to work on every day, despite having a series of little tasks to do—e.g. photocopying or cleaning?<br><br>Many thanks for your help.<br><br>Best wishes,<br><br>James</div>

<div>Brilliant! I just stumbled on this blog and have been trying AutoFocus for the last few days while watching SuperFocus unfold.<br><br>In AutoFocus, I needed to maintain a separate list of urgent and deadlined items (as I attempted to follow "DO use common sense. If something comes up that needs doing immediately, do it immediately.") I am glad now for Column Two, which integrates that list nicely. I am still using my calendar & 43-folder system for items that are not yet ready for attention today.<br><br>These systems remind me of those instances in math and physics in which "simple rules create complex behavior." It is almost mesmerizing to watch SuperFocus items flow from one column to the next, from one page to the next, watching some of them drop off (completed) and others combine with newer (urgent) items. This organic, somewhat-random flow is a wonderful way to defeat the patterns into which our brains would otherwise fall, as we would otherwise tend to resist certain sorts of items over & over.<br><br>Another reason I am so pleased with this: For some time, I had been haphazardly experimenting with a type of closed list. I was calling it a "batch," and I was trying to finish all the tasks in one batch before moving on to the next. However, I never got the right balance between urgent items and the rest, so that too often a batch of not-so-critical items blocked me from doing what I really needed to do. Then I would give up on batches for a while ... until some other frustration led me to come tinker with them again. Thankfully, Column Two and the page-at-a-time rule seem to implement precisely what I was trying for.<br><br>I did have an initial hitch or two with SuperFocus, due to a misreading, so for those of you playing with the system now, it may help to double check the following:<br><br>1. On my first read, I missed this important point: actioned, unfinished tasks go into Col. 2 of the **next** page! I'd been entering them on the same page, and I was beginning to feel hemmed in. I am glad I caught this--another bit of simplicity that has quite a profound effect.<br><br>2. I had also missed the distinction between "actioned" items and "completed" items, which sent a few things to the wrong place.<br><br>After a few more readings, and following the Q&A above, I think all is now straightened out for me.<br><br>Thanks very much, Mr. Forster and all commenters!</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Alan Baljeu - 2011-02-12 13:25</div>
<div>Hi James.  I think SuperFocus will work perfectly for that situation. I do think you have the rules slightly wrong. If essay writing is slightly complicated, draft a plan first. Drafting is a task for SF. The plan you keep with your essay materials.  <br><br>When the planning is complete, immediately enter the first step or two in SF. If the essay is urgent, enter on the current page, column 2. If not, enter it last page, column 1.  <br><br>When you work on something, you don't have to finish it immediately. You may pause, rewrite column 2 next page, do some stuff current page, then go to next page and resume. When you finish a step, go back to your plan and enter the next step.<br><br>(BTW this all is just a suggestion. There's no right or wrong way to use the system; only different approaches, and another will work as well. Go by what feels right. ) <br><br>If you feel the essay is Urgent, that suggests you stick at it longer before taking a break (and moving it forward to the next page). In this way you will get it done in good time, and you won't neglect life (or other classes) either.</div>

<div><<When you visit a page which is full (i.e. has no space left in either Column 1 or Column 2), all tasks on that page must be either actioned or dismissed.>><br><br>I read "either" as column1 is full OR column2 is full. Of course this makes no sense if you know the system, but I think it could be confusing. It confused me, and I already know the system. I would reword the parenthetical phrase to: "(i.e. has no space left in Column 1 and Column 2)". That is kind of awkward still. How about: "(i.e. Column 1 and Column 2 are both full)"</div>

<div>In addition to autofocus I've been also using Pomodoro technique (which basically has you work at things in 25 five minute time slots (pomodoro is italian for tomato - and the idea came from using a tomato shaped kitchen timer).  I wonder if you think this might integrate well with superfocus.  <br><br>More at <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/</a></div>

<div>New rule :<br>Column 1 as well as Column 2 has to be full before a page counts as “full” for dismissal purposes.<br><br>This rule is confusing for me. Sorry I dont understand it :<br>Last rule was if C1 is full and C2 is finished all task (ie are crossed) then C1 task's are dismissed.<br><br>Do I understand now if C1 is full and C2 is full ie crossed or not then both column are dismissed ? it would  go against the rule which says "Dismissal only applies to tasks in Column 1 Tasks in Column 2 must always be actioned." <br><br>So I understand it like this<br>If C1 is full (dissmissed, crossed or still active) <br>and IF C2 is full BUT all tasks are crossed (actioned)<br>THEN both columns C1 +C2 are dissmissed <br>But then why dismissing C2 which is already crossed ? <br><br>Mark do you autorize dismissing in column 2 ? <br><br>and  would you precise these points please ? thanks !</div>

<div>I have been finding that I come to actions that cannot be done because of my current location or resources.  This is, of course, not a problem if the item is in column 1 because it can simply be skipped.  However, if the item is in column 2, I am effectively trapped and unable to move on to the next page because the item cannot be done.  <br><br>For example, if I have started something at work (I'm a teacher) and not finished it, I enter it on column 2 of the next page.  Then shortly after that I decide to go to a coffee house and start working again.  As I move to that next page, I realize that I do not have a resource book that I need for the item "Plan Monday's lesson." If it's Wednesday, it isn't a big deal that I do not work on this item right away, but *technically* I can't move to the next page.<br><br>I have been just moving to the next page by cheating and saying that I have "actioned the item" by pausing long enough to think about it.  This allows me to just move it to the next page and move forward.  Is this appropriate?  Any better ideas?  I don't want to leave column 2 items floating about.</div>

<div>I am curious: how does SuperFocus relate to the book _Do It Tomorrow_?<br><br>SF is working nicely for me now, and I am wondering about getting the DIT book. Should I expect the DIT methods to add to the power of SF? Or is SF already an upgraded system compared to DIT (perhaps the beginnings of a replacement system), or is SF a different approach altogether?<br><br>Thanks for any advice.</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Don R - 2011-02-14 16:30</div>
<div>Bernie,<br>I think that the system if DIT is probably outdated by SF. Here are the key differences, as far as I can remember:<br><br>1. In DIT, you use a new page for each day. New tasks go on the next page (hence "Do it tomorrow"). At the start of the day, you draw a line at the end of the list. This closes the list. You are supposed to try to do everything on this list. Only urgent items can be added to this page, below the line. If you have uncommitted items, you move them forward to the next day that you have time. You are supposed to estimate how much time you need to do each task, so for example if you have 8 free hours in the day you can put up to 8 hrs of work on the page.<br><br>In SF the closed list is each page's column1. New items go to the end of the list. The urgent items go in col2. SF does not require you to estimate how much work you are going to need for each task. SF does not require you to work on a predetermined set of items in col1 however it does pressure you to complete urgent AND unfinished (col2) items. SF doesn't require you to rewrite items from the previous page each day.<br><br>When I did DIT I used to just have a long list of outstanding tasks with no time estimates. I wouldn't get to most of them, and then I would have to rewrite most of them every day. So I ended up procrastinating on bringing all the old items forward, so the whole thing fell apart. It was kind of overwhelming.<br><br>DIT also has something called the current initiative. It's the project that you do some work on the first thing every day. I think that SF handles this in the form of unfinished projects being in column2. It forces you to keep up with it until it's done.<br><br>DIT also had a distinction between backlog and current items. When you start the system, you probably have a bunch of old tasks built up (thousands of emails, piles of mail, etc.). He talks about separating those out into a backlog, making sure any NEW items get taken care of, and make clearing out the backlog its own project. This makes the backlog into a closed list (so it will be done eventually) and also making "clear the backlog" into your current initiate so that you can work through it a little each day until you catch up.<br><br>In SF I just have an incomplete project (col2) to clean out some old emails each day. I shoot for 100 and I should be done in a few weeks.<br><br>DIT is a short book and has a lot of interesting concepts, so it may be worth reading. However I think SF is a complete replacement, and much simpler.</div>

<div>Don R,<br>Thank you for taking the time to answer my DIT question in such detail!<br><br><br>Mr. Forster,<br>Thank you for pointing me to the comparative systems review. I had found and read the AutoFocus review page, in which AF 1 through 4 are compared, but I did not realize there was another page covering other systems as well. You have quite a few fascinating inventions!! I will read about them shortly.<br><br><br>Based on Don R's description of DIT, plus sketches of it I have read at other web sites, I am still very interested in the book. Many of the DIT elements described are very appealing to me, especially the backlog list (I have plenty of material for that one), and the *brilliant* idea of closing each day's new list after 24 hours of input (that's one of those "why didn't *I* think of that" ideas!). However, certain other mechanics of running the DIT system would most likely overwhelm me similarly to how Don R describes his experience.<br><br>This is what I *love* about SuperFocus! The overhead of running SF, all those things we are supposed to do "instead of doing real work" are folded incrementally into the work itself. We only end up going into "Hardcore Planning Mode" for those items that get sifted all the way through to dismissal--their presence, stranded on closed pages, is self-evident proof that they require some navel-gazing. Other items, for which formal planning is not needed, just end up done without engaging us in superfluous questions of category, priority, time estimates, etc.—I *hate* time estimates and am terrible at them!!<br><br>SuperFocus has almost zero footprint when it is not needed but jumps up in your face (dismissal) when it is. I cannot overstate how brilliant that is.<br><br>All that said, I am even more curious about DIT after reading Don R's post and will definitely add the book to my next Amazon order. I think it will add some nice, functional tricks to my SF system.<br><br>Thanks for your help!</div>

<div>There is also a summary linked below which you may have seen.  Personally, I think DIT and SF are very different in their approach.  I am starting to experiment more with "will do" type systems, which is a very DIT concept, so depending on your needs and personality, DIT may be better suited for you, as I think TM systems must fit the person and their needs.

<div>I find myself feeling like I *need* to stay on one page until I have actioned a sizable portion of the items on it.  I know that that isn't really bad, but then I also feel like I don't move from page to page very quickly.  Any advice on that?</div>

<div>Michael Littleton:<br><br>As you say, it isn't really bad. But on the other hand you don't seem very happy about it. <br><br>One thing you might find helpful is to write your tasks smaller (e.g. "Write first section of report" instead of "Write report". That way even if you do action a sizable portion of the items on a page, it shouldn't hold you up too long.</div>

<div>Personally, rather than coming up with various arbitrary rules on how to choose which items to work on, I find myself working most effectively when I follow the original "standing out" idea, described in the original AF1 -- and also follow the rules of the system *strictly*.  <br><br>Strictly following the rules trains the mind so that the "standing out" process works more effectively.  <br><br>Every day or two I like to look back and see what I've done, and see if I am making the kind of progress I need to make, and if the system is helping me do that, or if it's contributing to some kind of problem.<br><br>DWM was great, especially at gauging one's overall commitments.  It was pretty good at handling urgent things, too, because you could focus wherever you wanted on the list if needed.  Unfortunately this required your sense of "there's urgent stuff at the end of the list!!" to override the normal "standing out" process.   It tended to disrupt the "flow" and didn't have that meditative, "in the zone" quality of AF.   <br><br>SF is much better at driving toward completion, and strikes an even better balance between urgent vs less urgent, important vs not-important-now-but-will-be-later-if-you-neglect-it.   Most important, to me at least, is that it really preserves (and even enhances) that sense of being "in the zone", working on what really needs to be worked on, really feeling like one is making significant progress on the things that matter.   The "standing out" process has never been more effective.  <br><br>Looking back on the last week that I've been using SFv3, I don't see any gaps or limitations -- it's just working, and works best when I follow the rules strictly and work only on what "stands out".   It remains to be seen whether it can provide a gauge of overall workload like DWM does -- for me, that's the only outstanding issue at this point.</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Bernie - 2011-02-17 7:40</div>
<div>Two little habits have emerged in my SuperFocus system that I'd like to share:<br><br>1. As I scan a page looking for my next task, I typically end up clarifying the next step for several items that do not yet "stand out" as ready to be done. So I jot little crammed notes inside each task's half-page of a line. On further passes, the additional clarity makes these items much more attractive to do, albeit nearly illegible. I think I will start using entire facing pages as my "columns," per the option suggested in the SF instructions. Then the left part of each line can be for the initial phrasing of an item, and the rest of that line can contain these priceless clarifications. I like writing in pen on only one side of the page, so I will simply leave blank every alternate set of facing pages.<br><br>I did think of skipping alternate lines to leave space for notes, but this will halve the size of each closed list, possibly changing the overall flow of the system. SF/AF rules recommend 25-35 lines per page, so I would prefer to experience the system within those parameters before tinkering.<br><br>Index cards seemed attractive, at first: let a stack of 25-35 cards substitute for a page, and instead of running SF in a notebook, run it in a box of index cards. Use dividers to simulate the breaks between columns and pages. That is a great way to allow space for notes, as well as pulling the items after dismissal to keep someplace else; it also allows for ad-hoc sorting within a page and other interesting moves that would deviate from strict SF. However, when I imagined the mechanics of carrying the system around and scanning through those little stacks, I decided not to try it. There is something much more immediate about flipping a notebook page and seeing all those tasks at once.<br><br>2. I have begun using Post-It notes in Column Two to hold items that are urgent but cannot be done right now. Say I need to run an important errand today, but I am stuck at home waiting for the plumber, who has given me a vague four-hour window. Or, I need to hang up some wet camping equipment outside as soon as possible, but only when/if the sun comes out. These belong on the current page in Column Two, but if Column Two is short, these tasks could block me from turning the page for hours, or perhaps until tomorrow, while I wait for the right conditions. Meanwhile, I champ at the bit over those ongoing Column Two projects that I've written on the next page.<br><br>By rule (expressed during an AutoFocus discussion, I think), I can cross out anything that I'm *unable* to do now and just bring it forward; this is not procrastination, as long as I truly cannot do it now and yet it is truly urgent. So, I *could* write these urgent, conditional tasks in Column Two per usual and cross them out when they are the only ones left in the column, bringing them to the next page. But if you are like me, then knowing that they may have to get copied over creates a startling amount of resistance to writing them down at all. I could scold myself for this and quixotically resolve to do better ... but Post-Its are much more effective! I just peel them off and stick them to the next page. When I actually do the item, I copy it from the Post-It onto the "real" page and immediately cross it out, thus allowing Column Two to fill up properly. For some reason, I experience no resistance to this copy-and-cross-out maneuver. No one knows why.<br><br><br>Gerry, thanks for the link. I just read the article. Having recently fallen out of love with GTD, I have some observations triggered by this article, but as this post is already long, I will defer them for another time.<br><br>Michael, I had the same experience as yours for a while, wanting to linger on each SF page. Then it began to sink in that the sooner I push through Column Two, the sooner I get to come back around to all prior pages. Those tasks will still be there, and their column will be a closed list, a serenity I find myself looking forward to. Now I am satisfied with just doing whatever "stands out" and moving on. I do find myself doing occasional emergency scans of prior pages to reassure myself that nothing on them is terribly pressing—it never is, so hopefully I will grow out of this. Lately I have noticed a sort of reverse-reverse psychology: instead of resisting Column Two, I end up resisting the urge to hold back Column Two, and now I get an exciting little kick every time I turn the page.<br><br>The Brain: what a weird thing!</div>

<div>Malisa:<br><br>It's not part of the system as such, but one of the commenters (I forget who) in AF1 days suggested it, and I've done it ever since.<br><br>What you do is each time you get two adjoining crossed out tasks, you join them with a vertical line. It then becomes very easy to see at a glance where the remaining active tasks are on the page.</div>

<div>Thank you, thank you, thank you.<br><br>I have been searching for a task management methodology that suits me for years. I could never find anything that truly fitted me and my approach. I had almost given up when I somehow stumbled onto your site. Reading through the enormous amount of useful information I finally found superfocus and realised that this is me. I have been using it since v2 and it is wonderful for me.<br><br>I use an A6 size book with each column on the facing pages. I date each new page for tracking and write the tasks in my own shorthand. This means I can fit quite a bit in a line. I have one book for work and one for home and they both worked immediately.<br><br>I have various capture ways depending on what and where I am but anything that is captured is transferred as soon as possible to my notebook. The only difference for me is the recurring tasks that are done at specific day/times - I add to my electronic calendar as an appointment. Works for me.</div>

<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Helen - 2011-02-18 10:42</div>
<div>oh, one bit I forgot to mention - I start at the last page in my notebook and use it for scribbles, extra notes, information, etc. if I don't have any other tools to hand, or I want to follow up in another location. This way it does not interfere with the task management but I don't have to worry about losing info and I only have to take one notebook with me. <br><br>eg if I want to book a airline flight then the notes accompanying the booking such as prices, times, etc I write in the back of the notebook. Stuff I don't need to keep long term but need it to work with in the moment. Once I have booked the flight, I draw a line underneath the notes area for the next lot of scribbles and cross off the task. <br><br>If I need to refer back to the notes area from an unfinished task I make a N in a circle at the end of the task line which tells me I have something at the rear of the notebook. I use the same X and circle symbols to indicate which are current notes.</div>

<div>Thanks Helen and Seraphim for that tip - simple and effective. I tend to squeeze a lot of stuff into a line, having a notes area will free up precious real estate. I sometimes fear that resistance might build up to tasks that refer to notes because that requires flipping over to another page, but I think the benefits will outweigh the cost.</div>

<div>Helen, thanks for the tip on taking notes in back. That makes SF a true one-notebook system. Now I want to switch to a perforated notebook so I can tear out some of those back pages and file them. My experience has been like yours: tried various systems for years, and now I can't believe how simple SF is and how well it fits me. Plus it is fun to use, like a little game.<br><br>For anyone who has read the book _Flow_ by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, you will probably recognize his elements of mental "flow" in the SuperFocus system, particularly the way in which it becomes a game. I've been thinking about that connection a lot for the past few days. When I found SF, I had actually been striving to inject some game-like flow into my GTD setup; GTD's workflow has great potential for this, but for me it gets too complicated too quickly. Thus, when I discovered SF, I immediately felt it was made to order.<br><br>Helen, if SF fits you so well, you may want to look at Mark's free ebook _How to Make Your Dreams Come True_ if you haven't already. I just discovered it and cannot put it down, even though in the past I have not been impressed by books with this sort of title. Mark Forster's version may resemble other dream/visioning writings on the surface, but his keen insights and underlying concepts hold it together and give it real power. Not even halfway through, I am already getting that "ah-ah!" feeling, and it is so engrossing that I am compulsively sneaking a page or two in between everything else I am doing. Soon I expect to be compulsively clicking the Donate button up top.<br><br>_How To Make Your Dreams Come True_ free ebook:<br><a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2011/1/29/how-to-make-your-dreams-come-true.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2011/1/29/how-to-make-your-dreams-come-true.html</a><br><br>Thanks all.</div>

<div>Wonderful system for a pastor with a multitude of tasks which can feel overwhelming. Question: After working with the system for a number of days and having several pages, where does one start the next morning. I marked where I left off in column one, but would one normally start off at that mark or start with the urgent tasks first as a rule? I know certain times would dictate starting the urgent tasks, but as a normal rule does one start off in column one where they left off the previous day or would one start with the column 2 and the urgent list?</div>

Normally I mark a task with a dot against it in the left margin when I start work on it, so the task is left as if I were still working on it.<br><br>That means when I get to work the following morning, I know exactly where I left off and I have a choice of carrying on working on the open task, or finishing it and selecting the next task to work on (which could be one of the urgent tasks).<br><br>This seems to work fine.</div>

<div>"if the task is not finished, delete it in the same way. Re-enter it in Column 2 on the next page. If you are on the last page, then go back to the beginning of the list and re-enter the task in Column 2 of the first active page. If there is no room in Column 2, then re-enter it on the first page on which there is room."<br><br>HI<br><br>I started to try this last night and was confused early on by the above. When you've just started, the page you're working on is at the same time, the first page, the last page, and the active page all at the same time. So if the task is not finished, do you enter it in column 2 of the next page (starting a new page) or do you enter it on the same page?</div>

<div>Hi Stephen.<br><br>Yes.  Enter it into Column 2 of the current page.  Don't worry.  If you are honest with yourself and throw yourself headlong into the process, you will have more than one page in very short order.  I've been doing this for only a few days and currently have 4 active pages. <br><br>Also, I recommend taking a few minutes to look through your life as it stands and write down everything you need to do, want to do, might want to do, and think you should do.  The system will filter out the things that don't really need to be there and you will quickly come up with 30plus things to write in the book.  That should carry you over into a second page and open up possibilities for you that you hadn't considered before now.<br><br>@Mark - this is fabulous!  I have never been more focused.  I am also reading Making Your Dreams Come True.  I love it and will be moving into the next book in relatively short order.  Thank you.</div>

It is not intended that you flip back and forth randomly to read your notes but only when you are actually working on a task and only when you need to take notes or review the notes attached to the task. It is no different to opening a word doc to write a letter, or picking up the phone to make a call. It is a tool to use during the mapping and completion of the task. <br><br>As per Benie's idea, if your notes section gets too big then rip out the pages and either trash or file.

<div>So, just to clarify, there's no more room in Column 1 on one page.  I started a new Column 1 on the next page.  Since Column 1 is full on the previous page, do I still add to Column 2 on that same page?

<div>A question for Mark (and anyone else who might be able to help)...<br><br>How many "little and often" tasks would you typically have open at once?  I've been using SF3 (to amazing effect) for a couple of weeks now, and have reached the point where I have a number of larger tasks that need to be done, but obviously can't be done all in one go.  For example:<br><br> * Building a stone wall.<br> * Clearing a HUGE paperwork backlog.<br> * Working on a major new software project.<br> * Clearing my email backlog.<br> * Working on my wedding plans (which will take several revisions).<br> * Sorting through a big pile of old junk.<br> * Reading a book (not as big as War and Peace, but still pretty big).<br> * Building a new deck.<br> * Laying paving slabs.<br><br>All these tasks are going to take more than one go to complete (to be honest, many of these would probably take more than one *day* each to complete), which means that following the SF3 rules they'll be repeatedly added to column 2 until they're finished.  But some, for example clearing my paperwork backlog, might take a hundred iterations or more (I can't face more than 10 minutes at a time, and really do want to tackle this "little and often" because it's so darned huge).<br><br>I know I could in theory rephrase the items so they can be completed faster (and I have -- instead of saying "clear office paperwork backlog", I've rewritten this as "clear one bin of office paperwork backlog".  Ditto for "work a bit on the garden wall").  But it's still going to take a while to get through these tasks, even if they are broken down into smaller chunks.<br><br>So...how many of these types of tasks should I be working on at once?  I've currently got three "little and often" projects open, and am aware that every time I go from one page to the next, I'm adding three new items to column 2 of the next page.  Won't this fill up column 2 too quickly, limiting the number of times I can go through the pages and forcing me to dismiss other tasks too soon?  Also, because I've got three "little and often" projects already open, I'm reluctant to start working on other tasks that are also going to take a while because I know that will fill up column 2 with even more unifinished tasks.<br><br>Any suggestions?  I haven't filled column 2 yet, but I'm getting close on some of my open pages...<br><br>Thanks,<br><br> - Erik.</div>

<div><<At present I have three active tasks in Column 2, of which one is a long unfinished task, and two urgent tasks.>><br><br>Here's the issue I've ran up against. On every page, I'm forced to clear column 2, many of which move forward to column 2 of the next page. Then I'm obliged to work on something from column 1. If I can't finish it, it also goes forward to column 2 of the next page. If my list consists of rather large projects I want to work on, then column 2 grows with every page turn.<br><br>My solution is simply to run through column 2 when it gets too long (say > 6 items) and think "Is this good enough for now? Am I happy with the progress so far? Can I afford to take a break?" If the answer is yes, I re-enter it in column 1, giving myself some breathing room.<br><br>I see this as simply a way to re-evaluate what is "urgent". What was urgent a few days ago, may not be so urgent now. Or to look at it another way, I may have been keen to work on something (it "stood out"), but it was unrealistic to think about starting another big task until the other ones were finished.<br><br>Perhaps a long column 2 should help temper whether or not something "stands out". It could be I really *want* to work on something, but given the other tasks currently underway, it should be delayed. But the system *forces* me to work on something in column 1. If column 1 is dominated by long tasks, the only way to "work on them" would be to enter them on a calendar to re-enter at a future date.<br><br>The challenge will be to find a way to codify the kinds of insights that the folks on the blog are giving. The system doesn't need more "rules", but perhaps ways of shaping or defining what some of the terms mean (like "stands out").</div>

<div>I want to agree with Bernie that 'These systems remind me of those instances in math and physics in which "simple rules create complex behavior." '<br><br>I am particularly intrigued by the choices that SF3 imposes.  An item that is in C1 can either be left there, to be attacked on a later go round the list.  But if you make that choice, there's a chance that the task may eventually suffer dismissal.  <br><br>It can avoid that fate by being acted on.  But then it will linger in C2 until it is finished.  And that lingering will diminish the likelihood that other tasks will be started and brought out of C1.  Time spent with the method provokes thoughtfulness about which tasks to embark on.<br><br>Effectively the list is a visual simulation of a market for your time and attention, in which the tasks jostle for continued survival.</div>

<div><<I would recommend only having one task of the size of "Clear Paperwork Backlog".>><br><br>Ah, thank you.  So when you're choosing tasks in column 1 to work on, you keep in mind what is already in column 2, so that you don't overload it with more than one long unfinished tasks.  That makes sense...<br><br>I guess the only question is what to do if you get to a page which only has long tasks left in column 1.  Would you dismiss them as being "too big to tackle right now"?  But I'm really just speculating -- looking through my list, I don't have any pages which only have big tasks left, so this probably wouldn't happen...<br><br>Thanks again -- oh, and doubly thank you for creating such a fantastic system!</div>

<div>Robert:<br><br>Bear in mind that the "norm" for dealing with all tasks is to put the in Column 1 and let them come up in the normal course of working the list. Tasks should only be put in Column 2 if a) they are so urgent you need to work on them on the current page b) you have defined the task to be so large that it can't be dealt with in one go.</div>

<div>I see that I am not alone in the struggle to control Column Two. I have been entering all sorts of gigantic, half-baked things into Column One, and now I have started too many of them, and they are hanging around in Column Two. Since several of these Column Two items are not likely to go away anytime soon, it effectively means a lot of Column One is going to be dismissed in the near future, as I must now vigorously defend Column Two.<br><br>Here is what I am planning to try:<br><br>When I reach a huge item in Column One, I will spend a moment thinking about what its next manageable step would be. If I am clear on that, I will jot it next to the item, redefining the item to be small. If I am not ready to do it now, I will strike it from that page and enter it at the end of Column One. When I eventually do the small item, as I strike it out, I will follow up by entering its next step in Column One. But what if I am not sure of the next step? Then I will enter "Project X: next step ??" in Column One.<br><br>In fact, whenever I find "Giant Project X" in Column One, I will consider it to be shorthand for "Think of next step on Giant Project X and enter it in Column One." Thus, the "Giant Project X" task will be struck through as soon as I figure out what to really do about it, and the actual work will go onto a new page where it will get its own full lifespan. I hope this will keep things out of Column Two without putting them entirely on ice.</div>

<div>I am suspicious that part of the confusion with column two may be because of a confusion over what is meant by being finished with some task. Those of us who started with the original AF a couple of years ago are more used to this. You can enter a huge task like "clean out the bath closet" (well, huge for me) work on it for ten minutes and enter it at the end of the list in C1 even if it is not "finished" in the truest sense. I just need to do something. You do not have to enter every started project into C2. You don't even necessarily have to precisely define every task, a la GTD.  I don't enter something into column two unless I know I want to work on it at a pace that matches the speed i am moving throughout the list. Even then I will move it back to the end of the list in column one if I can slow back down and work on it less often.</div>

<div>Okay, having reread the rules, I want to clear something else up, just to make sure I'm getting it right.  I started using Superfocus recently, and I put everything I had to do (which wasn't much) in Column 1, since nothing was urgent at the time.<br><br>Now, as I'm understanding the rules, since this page is the only page, unfinished stuff from Column 1 goes into Column 2 on the same page.  BUT, if there were more pages, it instead goes into Column 2 on the next page, or whatever page has room.<br><br>What I did was that, as I did stuff in Column 2, I re-inserted it back into Column 2 because it still wasn't done.  Should I have done this?  I was still on the same, single page I began the system with.</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Bernie - 2011-02-28 0:34</div>
<div>Matt WIllard,<br><br>The way I understand it, one major function of Column Two is to keep you looking at various pages of Column One. The value in flipping a page, driven by Column Two, is that you get to look at Column One on the next page.<br><br>Thus, there is no benefit to writing in Column Two on a new blank page, and this is why, in the single-page situation, the current page is also taken to be the "next" page. We only start new pages with Column One, after which those pages become interesting to look at, and hence they become eligible for Col. Two items.<br><br>I hope this is correct. In any case, it makes a lot of sense to me.  ;)</div>

<div>Just wanted to write a thank you for SuperFocus based on something I noticed today.  I've been working the list for a while, and today was the first day I actually highlighted tasks for dismissal.  My list started with a pretty sizable backlog -- things I'd meant to do but hadn't started.  Those things had been weighing on my mind pretty heavily.  Superfocus let me get started on chipping away at that backlog, let me handle the new things that came up, and today, I feel very confident that the things I disimissed truly are not that important right now.  No other system has helped me deal with a backlog so well.</div>

<div>Rick, in the second bullet point, "the next page" refers to the 2nd column on the next page.

<div>Hi Mike,<br><br>I'll write SuperFocus apps for iPhone (and maybe for Mac and iPad as well) this year. I tried OminiFocus, 2Do, SpeedTask, Task Eater, Voodo, and many more apps on my iPhone and found they weren't suitable for SuperFocus. :P<br><br>Best regards,<br>Box</div>

<div>SuperFocus revolves around the notion of pages.  If TaskPaper doesn't separate out into pages, it just won't work.  One "page" with Column 1 and Column 2 is inadequate.</div>

<div>So you would use the iPhone or smartphone or whatever to take notes and then transfer those notes to your notebook in the appropriate column? The notebook acts as the bible and everything else supports that?</div>

<div>I think I may have found a possible electronic workaround. I'm a big fan of Evernote. I created a new note and inserted a column, 25 rows and 2 columns. I can add another table after the first one and each table basically acts as its own notebook page. Will let you know how this works out.</div>

<div>Just a couple of quick questions regarding the process.<br><br>1. I made a list of items in my Column 1. The list stretches onto two pages.<br>2. I just keep working random items in Column 1 as I feel like doing them. If I finish the item, I cross it off. If I don't finish it, then I highlight the item in Column 1 and it goes in Column 2 on page 1 or page 2? <br>3. If I don't have any items in Column 2, can I start working on the items in Column 1 on Page 2?<br><br><br>Thanks</div>

<div>Mike,<br><br>Whether you finish an item or not, if you take any action on the item you cross it out (delete) the item. If it is unfinished, you write it in column two on the next page. You move on to the next page any time you have taken some action on every item in column two and nothing more stands out in column one. Dismissal (when you highlight) is a different issue. This happens whenever you come to a page (i.e. you finish work on one page and turn to the next) and you fail to take some action on at least one item in column one. Note, you do not have to action every item in column one.<br><br>One other note about completing tasks. If you are starting a large project that you cannot finish in one go, you have a choice on how to work it within SF3. You do this by how you define "finished." If you break the project into sub-projects, then you are finished (for the moment) when you finish one or more sub-projects. Cross it off your list and re-enter the next sub-project at the end of the list in column one.  You could conceivably work through a long project, over several weeks, without using column two at all. Or, you can use column two. You could start a project or task, work on the it for a while, cross it out when you are done working on it, and re-enter it in column two on the next page because you have not "finished" what really needs to be finished. It is up to you to define finished. But do not overuse column two. This seems to be leading to problems for some users.</div>

<div>Re: Using Evernote. One thing I have noticed already as it pertains to accessing your list on an iPhone or iPad. If you created the table on your Mac or PC, you will be unable to add/edit/delete any of your entries if you access the note on your iPhone or iPad. The iPhone and iPad version of Evernote does not support rich text editing. You can edit a plain text file, but not a file that has something like a table in it. You can copy the note or convert it to plain text if you really need to edit it. Wanted to put that out there.</div>

<div>For electronic versions, what about working each column as a separate list?<br><br>One list is column 1. Every so often (approx 30 tasks), draw a line and declare that a page end.<br><br>The other list is column 2. Unless I mis-read something, those are the only two pages that matter for column 2. On every other page, all the tasks in column 2 have been crossed out. You can't leave a page until they're all crossed out and you only enter tasks on the next page. So you only need 2 pages of column 2: current and next.<br><br>Add to column 2 following the regular SF rules. Urgent tasks go on the current page. Tasks to be repeated or continued go on the next page.<br><br>Begin the day at the current page of both lists.<br><br>You turn the page on both lists at the same time. To do this, both the following must be true:<br><br>- Column 2 current page is finished.<br><br>- Column 1 current page has no items that stand out. If you have done nothing on the page during this pass, dismiss everything on it (or put the page on notice and dismiss everything the next time you reach that page). To turn the page, just scroll past the end-of-page line.<br><br>To turn the page for column 2, the current page becomes ancient history (everything on it has been done, delete it), the next page becomes the current page, and a new blank page becomes the next page. In other words, delete everything above the first end-of-page line -- everything's been done. Change the title of the next page to "current". Draw a new end of page line at the bottom and title that "next".<br><br>With this system, you don't see how many column 2 tasks you do before finishing a column 1 page. You do, however, get a feel for how fast you move through column 2 tasks.</div>

<div>Cricket,<br><br>The only thing left out of your electronic plan is the way Column Two fills up on a page, eventually forcing its Column One to be dismissed. If I understand your plan right, it omits this part of SF by emptying the electronic Column Two with each page turn, effectively resetting the "dismissal clock." Of course, Column One would still be dismissed if the user visits the page without finding anything to stand out.<br><br>One way to address this: before turning the page, count up Column Two's dismissed items, and insert the count in parentheses at the top of the current Column One. Then delete the Column Two page etc. as you described. Next visit to that page, you will know how much room Column Two has to go before forcing dismissal of the page.</div>

<div>How does everyone keep track of contextual items like errands  or agendas of things to talk to someone about.  Do you track those on a separate list somehow?

<div>Bernie,<br><br>Good point, and good solution. <br><br>I hadn't realized how Column 2 limits the number of turns each page gets. If there are many column 2 tasks, you don't get many chances to do that page of column 1. If you have many column 2 tasks that week, you have to be pickier about which column 1 tasks you do. It's something I need to think about.</div>

<div>I am not real happy with SAF inability to deal with contexts... I dont want to have to keep separate lists for things I want to buy, or discuss with people, etc... then I have basically another whole  management system to consider.  Call me stupid, but I prefer to keep it simple and that means the less differnt places I have to keep things organized the better.  <br><br>I have read most of the posts here and nothing really jumps out at me saying it will make sure that when I get in the car today at 15:00 that I will know that there are 5 things I need to buy...<br><br>Or, if I have a number of things that fit in another time/place on a page, I can not action them, and its possible I can not action anything else, so suddenly they are all dismissed... when in fact I do not want to dismiss them...<br><br>Some say use separarate SAF systems, or alternating pages... again that looses the elegances of SAF in that it becomes selective or fragmentary super auto focus...<br><br>A related problem I have is routines (several times a day, daily, weekly, longer).  Again, I have read that I have to use another system for these if they have fixed times.  I would rather I could depend on SAF to remind me.. but if I am not passing through my list fast enough I might miss a deadline...  For single scheduled events, I could live with a calendar, since its hard to live without one, but again, too bad that some tasks, like 'meet with John re xxx' would not be entered in SAF once they have a date... then I basically have two AF systems... plus the ones when I have to keep for different contexts, and different people and different meetings.... YIKES.<br><br>Any advice how to keep is simple?</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Alan Baljeu - 2011-03-23 18:44</div>
<div>You are correct that some things don't fit in SAF.  The simplest approach is to have a notebook of short lists for other stuff.  A page for routines, a page for a shopping list, a page for all the things you need to discuss when you meet John, a page for stuff scheduled this month, etc.  In SAF you put tasks, and some of those tasks reference the above pages.  <br><br>You could have a task that says "Go shopping".  If you run across that and have time to shop, turn to the list.  On the other hand if it's 15:00 and you feel it's time to shop, just do it now.  Turn to the list, get in the car, and head.</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Chris - 2011-03-24 3:26</div>
<div>Grant,<br>One thing to keep in mind is that contexts are really nothing more than separate lists. So in theory, you could run separate SF lists just as efficiently in SF as  you would in a system like GTD that formally utilizes contexts. If you think of something that needs a context such as making a specific phone call, add it to the phone list and make sure you have an entry on the main SF list that reminds you to work the phone list.<br><br>Another point about the problem of being reminded. No list will ever remind you of what you need to do any more than a pile of bills will spontaneously remind you which ones to pay. If you cannot make it through the list frequently, then you need something else, like an electronic calendar or a 43 folder set up. In some versions of Autofocus I found that I could use an electronic task program and I would use it to set contexts and reminders. The trouble is that I have yet to find one that will work with SF.</div>

<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Seraphim - 2011-03-24 4:21</div>
<div>One of the SF "best practices" is to keep your project files outside of SF.   <br><br>I handle errands and meetings as though they were projects, in the sense that they are best handled outside of SF.<br><br>This does NOT mean I need a complete separate "system" for managing them.   <br><br>I think it is best illustrated by an example.   Let's say that it occurs to me that I need to buy dog food.   And let's say I am in a hurry and don't have time to think about it much.   So, I write it in my catch-all list:  SuperFocus.<br><br>Later, as I am working through my list, I see "dog food".   This is an easy 10-second task, and those ones almost always "stand out".   I think, "I need to run by Walmart to get dog food.  I'll put it on my Walmart list."   I have a single page for Walmart in the back of my SF notebook (in the very back -- NOT interspersed with the main pages).  It has a few items on it.  I then write "Walmart" in C1 of the last page.  Or, if it looks like the Walmart list is getting pretty long and/or urgent, then I'll write it in C2.<br><br>When the "Walmart" task stands out, I look for a spot on my calendar during my commute home.  If I can squeeze in 30 minutes for Walmart, then I write it into my calendar.<br><br>The whole process takes far longer to type than to actually do.  It takes less than 1 minute to do all that.  It's very simple and it works very well.   <br><br>Also, when I get into my car to drive home, and I don't have any errands scheduled and have a bit of extra time, it just takes a few seconds to open my SF book, and scan my Walmart list and other similar lists (hardware store, grocery store, etc.) to check if I should run any of those errands right now.<br><br><br>Another example:   I use NEO for email.  I use a few categories (like Gmail labels) for different agendas.   I have one for my boss.  So, whenever I get an email and it has something I need to discuss with my boss, I add a "To do" flag, apply the category, and archive the email.  I'm done.  <br><br>If I am in a meeting, and an issue arises that I need to discuss with my boss, I can either send myself an email (which gets the same treatment described above), or jot it in my SF book.   When I run across that task in my SF book, I send myself a quick email and then give it the treatment described above.<br><br>I already have a regularly scheduled meeting with my boss every week or two.  Before the meeting, I look at the "To Do" items in that category, and make a quick list, and send it to my boss for our meeting agenda.  Or if I don't have time, I just go through the To Dos during the meeting.  <br><br>Again, this is simple and effective.   I don't need to think about those items at all after I put them into the NEO category and tag them as To Do -- I know that they will get handled at the meeting.<br><br>I handle every regularly recurring team meeting exactly the same way.   I also handle meetings with my wife and daughter the same way (but on paper, with a list of items to discuss), and meetings for a local community group that I volunteer with.<br><br>These are all very simple to set up, quick and easy to process and maintain, and don't require any "system" to speak of, just simple lists.  These lists don't need to be processed with SF rules or any other kinds of rules.</div>

<div>Thanks all,<br><br>I guess I was hoping for some kind of magic bullet.  <br><br>My problem is my 'things to remember' lists are too many and get spread far too wide and far for my comfort: SAF for top level action management; project action lists in a notebook, smartphone, mindmaps, etc; (many) people and (many) groups discussion lists in a notebooks, in Mylifeorganized, a calendar, plus somekind of system that brings up routines, habits I am trying to develop, or actions depending on time of day and odd places I might be...<br><br>I will continue to apply SAF and 'project/context' lists and see how far they go in reducing this to a few 'sources', plus a calendar.  My immediate worry is that I will need hondreds of pages just for the extra lists... but probably I am not really that busy or well networked ;-)<br><br>I worry a bit too about branching too often to other lists will affect the main ASF processing in some negative way... but I will see..</div>

<div>You're right on: you don't want lots of things to remember. You want a calendar for appointments and events. You want SF for things you need to do. <br><br>The only other thing needed is a place for details of things you need to do.  Only watch is to to ensure things that need doing are covered by the calendar and SF, not buried in details - because only the calendar and SF get reliably and regularly examined.  If you do that you shouldn't need a zillion places to store things. <br><br>Big hint: One of Mark's best ideas is the closed backlog. Start with a mess (eg your  collection of information spots), and declare you will not add to that mess (no new spots). This represents your closed backlog. It can never grow. <br><br>Now start shrinking it. Create a task to reduce the mess a little (consolidate, delete, organize something out of the mess into a clean new space). Do a bit, and reenter the task to do a bit more later.</div>

<div>Hi Grant,<br><br>I have a reputation of being drastically overcommitted.  :-)   But I have only four sheets in the back of my notebook for errand tasks; three sheets for home "agendas" (wife, daughter, volunteer group"; another five or six work "agendas" (for different regular meetings at work, some of which I run myself).  So errands and agendas make up about 10 simple, short lists.<br><br>Projects are greater in number.  For home projects, I have a big stack of clear poly folders, all sitting on a single shelf near my desk.  They contain project plans, notes, clippings from catalogs and magazines, printouts, bills, invoices, etc.  There's no way I'd want to carry that around with me in my little SF notebook.<br><br>For work projects, I keep most of the supporting documents on my hard drive, in My Documents, each project in a folder, always kept sorted by "most recently modified" so the most active projects appear at the top of the list.  There are about two dozen projects in there -- only about 5 of them stay near the top at any given time.   It includes MS Office files, specialized project files like XML and DTD or whatever, notes and odds and ends.<br><br>Anyway, even with my being "vastly overcommitted" (as some have said)  ;-), I really only have a small number of places for all these supporting lists and other documentation.   It's really pretty simple and straightforward.   I would guess that your worries about having 100's of lists scattered all around when you have your SF system up and running are unfounded.   <br><br>Like Alan wrote, it can work great to start where you are today, and make the commitment to STAY CURRENT with whatever things you have on your plate right now:  all tasks in SF, and set up simple lists or folders or whatever for your ongoing current projects and agenda.  And then add one more task to SF:  "Clean up the backlog of all those other lists!", and let it sit in Column 2 as long as it takes to clean through it.   But keep your CURRENT work your top priority.  This method of working backlogs is SOOOO effective!   I've used it many times  (THANKS MARK!!), and have recently been teaching my daughter to use it (feeling behind for the first time in her college classes!).   :-)</div>

<div>mark in tx:<br><br>"Dismissed" is explained in detail in the rules under the heading "Dismissal", and means that a task no longer features on the active list, i.e. it is not considered when cycling through the list. A dismissed task is highlighted. Dismissed tasks never appear on active pages.<br><br>"Rejected" is used in the normal sense of the word. It is not a technical term in SuperFocus.<br><br>"Complete" can either refer to a task or to a page. A completed task is one in which all the outstanding work has been done. An uncompleted task is one in which there is still work to be done. A completed page is one in which all tasks have either been actioned or dismissed.<br><br>"Active" can also refer to a task or a page. An active task is one that appears on an active page and is not crossed out.  An active page is one on which there are active tasks. <br><br>In the photograph, the left hand page is complete and all the tasks on it have been crossed out because they have been actioned. The right hand page is still active and containes a mixture of actioned (crossed out) and active tasks (not crossed out).<br><br>I would strongly suggest that the best way to understand the system is to try it out. You can really only understand it by doing it. Do it as best you can for a day or so, and then re-read the rules to make sure you are doing it right. Repeat this process until you are confident that you have it right.</div>

<div>* What happens when all the tasks on the page are not ready to be done now, but are recurring tasks, and soon will be ready to be done.<br><br>* for e.g. what if all the remaining tasks on column1 of a page are bathe, cut nails, clean desk? and none of them need to be done now, because I finished doing them very recently and re-entered them sine they are recurring tasks.<br><br>* should these tasks be dismissed? it might be long before dismissed tasks are re-entered. And most likely I will be re-entering them while doing "review dismissed tasks" task. so should I re-enter them on last page without dismissing them, or should I dismiss them?</div>

<div>Jigar:<br><br>Has this situation actually happened to you?<br><br>If you have done them very recently, then it doesn't sound very likely that they would be the only remaining tasks on the page.<br><br>But if it does happen, then you should dismiss them.<br><br>Tasks which recur at a longer interval than a couple of days shouldn't be re-entered on the list, but be put in a reminder system in order to be brought forward when they are due to be done.</div>

<div>I like very much this blog and Mark systems.<br>Congratulations to all of you.<br><br>My little contribution to you.<br><br>Translation to Portuguese (Brasil) of SF Rules.<br><br>Hugs and Thanks<br>Basile<br><br>SUPERFOCUS<br> <br>Superfocus é um método simples, mas muito efetivo de processar seu trabalho. Você escreve tudo que você tem que fazer numa longa lista, em um caderno. <br> <br>Então você começa pelo início da lista e permanece circulando pela primeira página, trabalhando nas tarefas até que você tenha trabalhado em quantas julgou suficiente.  Então você vai para a próxima página e faz o mesmo. Assim que você alcançar o final da lista, retorne ao início, e comece novamente na primeira página. <br> <br>Em cada página há uma segunda coluna na qual você pode colocar tarefas adicionais, conforme abaixo:<br><br>	- Quando estiver trabalhando numa página,  você pode inserir qualquer tarefa urgente àquela página. <br> <br>	- Se você trabalhar numa tarefa e não terminá-la, recoloque a tarefa na próxima página. <br> <br>Uma regra importante é que não se deve deixar uma página antes de trabalhar em todas as tarefas na coluna 2.<br> <br>Este sumário apenas dá uma descrição geral, portanto é  importante que você leia o conjunto completo de regras como dado abaixo, e especialmente que você tenha certeza de que entendeu as regras sobre  o descarte de tarefas. <br> <br><br>AS REGRAS<br> <br>Superfocus é um avançado, porém simples, sistema de gerenciamento do tempo, que almeja dar o melhor balanceamento possível entre tarefas fáceis e difíceis, bem como entre tarefas urgentes e não urgentes.  Também se assegura que você termine o que começou. <br> <br>O sistema utiliza um caderno pautado com duas colunas em cada página. Se você não conseguir inserir 2 colunas nas páginas do seu caderno, você pode, ao invés, usar páginas que estão de frente uma para a outra. <br> <br>As duas colunas funcionam de modo diferente:<br> <br>Coluna 1<br> <br>Inicialmente todas as tarefas são inseridas na coluna da esquerda (coluna 1) (a não ser que sejam urgentes).<br> <br>A lista na coluna 1 segue de maneira contínua de página para página. <br> <br> <br>Coluna 2<br> <br>Usada exclusivamente para tarefas urgentes e inacabadas. <br> <br>COMO FUNCIONA O SISTEMA<br> <br>Pegue seu caderno. <br> <br>Deixando espaço para uma segunda coluna, escreva uma lista de tudo que você tem de fazer, ao longo da parte esquerda da página, uma tarefa por linha. <br> <br>Continue por quantas páginas necessário, usando apenas o lado esquerdo da página. <br> <br>Insira tarefas adicionais conforme você se lembrar delas ou assim que aparecem. <br> <br>Comece o trabalho na página 1 considerando cada tarefa, até que uma  delas esteja pronta para ser realizada. Trabalhe nela por quanto tempo desejar. Quando você terminar de trabalhar nela, escolha<br> uma das duas ações abaixo:<br> <br>	- Se a tarefa terminou, apague-a passando um traço horizontal sobre ela. Se for uma tarefa recorrente, recoloque-a ao final de sua lista, na coluna 1.<br> <br>	- Se a tarefa  não terminou, apague-a do mesmo modo. Recoloque-a na coluna 2 da próxima página. Se você já está na última página, então volte para o começo da lista e recoloque a tarefa na coluna 2 da primeira página ativa. Caso não haja espaço na coluna 2, então recoloque-a na primeira página em que houver espaço. <br> <br>Coloque tarefas urgentes na coluna 2 da página em que você está atualmente trabalhando. Se não houver mais lugar na coluna 2, então insira-a na primeira página que dispor de espaço. <br> <br>Prossiga trabalhando do mesmo modo, circulando através da primeira página até que você não mais perceba nenhuma tarefa como pronta para ser realizada. Todas as tarefas da coluna 2 devem ser feitas antes que você vá para uma nova página. <br> <br>Continue circulando pela página 1 até que todas as tarefas na coluna 2 tenham sido realizadas e que não haja mais tarefas na coluna 1 percebidas como prontas para realização. Esclarecendo: você não precisa terminar todas as tarefas na coluna 1, mas você tem de terminar todas as tarefas da coluna 2.<br> <br>Vá para a próxima página e continue agindo da mesma forma. <br> <br>Assim que você alcançar o final da lista, volte ao começo. <br> <br>Quando não restarem mais tarefas ativas na página, a página terá terminado, não fazendo mais parte da lista ativa. Esta regra não se aplica à última página. Observe que a coluna 2 não precisa estar cheia. Na foto acima, a página esquerda está completa. A linha ondulada na parte de baixo da coluna 2 serve para impedir entradas acidentais de futuras tarefas na coluna 2.<br> <br>DESCARTE<br> <br>O descarte é umas importante processo para retirar tarefas que não estão indo a lugar nenhum.  <br><br>Há duas ocasiões em que tarefas são descartadas:<br><br>1. Se nenhuma tarefa foi feita na coluna 1 durante uma visita à página, todas as tarefas remanescentes na coluna 1 são descartadas. Esta regra não se aplica à última página da lista.<br><br>2. Quando você visitar uma página que está cheia (ou seja, coluna 1 e coluna 2 cheias), todas as tarefas da coluna 1 nesta página devem ser ou realizadas ou descartadas.<br><br>O descarte só se aplica à tarefas da coluna 1. Tarefas da coluna 2 devem sempre ser realizadas.<br><br><br>Descarte é onde o sistema finalmente se livra de todos os itens que peneirou e considerou deficientes. Isto pode ocorrer bem rapidamente (por exemplo, se você entrou com uma longa lista de livros que pensava em ler), mas mais usualmente bem devagar.<br><br>Estas tarefas não estão mais ativas, mas sujeitas à revisão. É uma boa idéia ter uma tarefa recorrente em sua lista chamada "Rever Tarefas Descartadas". Na revisão você poderá considerar cuidadosamente porque elas foram rejeitadas, se elas de fato devem ser feitas, se elas o distraem de seus principais objetivos, e quaisquer outros fatores. Quando você re-inserir um item descartado, freqüentemente é boa idéia subdividi-la ou reescrevê-la de algum modo.<br><br>Marcar itens rejeitados facilitam sua revisão (com um marcador de texto).<br><br>Lembre-se que as regras de descarte não se aplicam à página em que se está atualmente escrevendo (ou seja, a última página).<br><br>SINAIS E SÍMBOLOS<br><br>a. Quando uma tarefa for terminada, risque-a com um traço horizontal.<br><br>b. Quando uma tarefa for descartada, marque-a com um marcador de texto.<br><br>c. Quando uma tarefa descartada for revisada e re-inserida ou removida, ela deve ser riscada para não mais estar sujeita à revisão.<br><br>d. Uma página que não mais possui tarefas ativas é marcada com um "X" no canto superior externo.<br><br>e. Quando não mais houver tarefas ativas nas páginas antecedentes, o "X" deve ser circulado.<br><br>f. Quando não mais houver tarefas descartadas ainda sujeitas à revisão em qualquer das páginas anteriores, o círculo deve ser marcado (com um marcador de texto).</div>

<div>I'm new to Mark Forster's perspectives on time management, but they sound very promising. I've read over the SF description and rules a couple of times today, plus all the comments. While it sounds very promising for working with tasks, I'm missing the piece on how it works with projects. <br><br>If I have a multi-month, multi-task complex project that I'm responsible for, can SF help me? How would I know where I am in the project? How would I track tasks that need to be done in sequence? How do I get the big picture view to know whether my project is moving along as it needs to?<br><br>Thank you for any insight and explanations.</div>

<div>SuperFocus is not especially geared for projects, but it can fit like this:<br><br>1. Keep your project plans separately from SuperFocus.<br>2. In SuperFocus add tasks as needed, such as:<br>a) Plan this project<br>b) Work on this project<br>c) Work on task X from the project</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Steve - 2011-06-15 22:46</div>
<div>Thank you for the reply, Alan. Doesn't that leave me to copy task X, Y, and Z (and the other 23 letters) from my project plan into SuperFocus? That sounds pretty inconvenient to me, unless I'm overlooking something. An earlier post questioned the value of a system that requires you to have other systems, as in "keep your project plans separately from SuperFocus." <br><br>Please don't take this wrong -- I'd love to have a super tool for task and time management. But SuperFocus seems so simple that it feels like major functionality must have been left out. Also, how does SuperFocus relate to this quote from Mark Forster's home page:<br><br>"To Do Lists<br>A to do list is the finest known way of ensuring that you never get to the end of your work. The proof? How often have you ended the day with more items on your to do list than you started it with?"<br><br>Isn't SuperFocus a To Do list?<br><br>It won't cost me much but some time and a notebook to try it, but I'm interested in any responses before I do that.<br><br>Thank you.</div>

<div>Steve, If you dislike copying a few words, you won't like SuperFocus. In practice though it's not an issue as it's quick compared to the time for actually doing stuff.  But do _not_ copy all project tasks over. Rather, plan your project and only copy over the tasks that you plan to do soon - not all tasks.  <br><br>As for having one system to plan and to do, you can try that, but perhaps you will have something that's less effective at both. SuperFocus is like a todo list, but its rules for dismissing pages help keep the list from growing out of control.</div>

<div>Steve,<br><br>About this:<br><br>"To Do Lists<br>A to do list is the finest known way of ensuring that you never get to the end of your work. The proof? How often have you ended the day with more items on your to do list than you started it with?"<br><br>ToDo lists, in this context, has to do with open to-do lists that any of us has tried once, i.e. "write it down and do it at some point". No time to stop and think about why you would be doing this or that that is written on the list. Did you write it on the list because you were interested in doing it, or really committed to doing it?<br><br>Superfocus is a system involving a list of tasks, indeed. But they are not "to-do". The system is constantly presenting all the tasks to you, leaving you free to do them or not. It is also a system that tells you : "Hey, you've been procrastinating on this task many times. You should think about it and find out why."<br><br>The real problem is not the list. It is the way you are looking at the things you do. The system puts the control of what you are doing and why you are doing it back into your hands, not in the normative "TO DO" list. And that's scary a responsibility, I confess.</div>

<div>Steve:<br><br>You're asking some good questions here.<br><br>On the subject of project management, I've always maintained that project management and time management are two separate disciplines. And since people may want or need or have to manage their projects in many different ways (or none at all), it makes little sense to tie a time management system to any one way of managing projects. <br><br>On the subject of to do lists, I confess I wrote the passage you quote long before I developed SuperFocus and it probably needs rewriting. However SuperFocus is a way of overcoming the problems inherent in the To Do list, while keeping its one major advantage - that you can write any task at the end of the list without having to worry about classifying or prioritising it or indeed worrying about whether you should do it at all.</div>

<div>Your SuperFocus post might be more compelling, plus quicker and simpler to understand, if you had step-by-step photos (photos that illustrate each phase of the process).  That way you might spend less time answering questions that arise from confused readers.

<div>How do "will do" lists fit into AF? I started out by reading Auto Focus rules then bought 'Do It Tomorrow' and became convinced of the importance of making a 'will do' list. How does this work with AF? Can you plan more than one task at a time that you will do?</div>

<div>Hi Mark and everybody, this is my first post here. I just started using Superfocus and I have some questions.<br>I work as a freelance animator and renderer. My major concern is how to deal with my work, because it can vary dramatically in this way:<br><br>. When I have active projects to do I normally don't have time to do nothing else in the day, cause times are really deadly quick, and I have to work part of the night too. <br><br>. Then when I don't have projects running, the day changes alot, cause I don't really have strictly "to do" things. I must judge it for myself, if I have to spend time looking for other works, or to study some new tecniques, work to improve some workflow, work on personal projects.<br><br>So I'd like to ask you:<br>Do you think other methods presented in this blog other then SF could be better for my situation?<br><br>Specific to Superfocus:<br>Do you enter daily tasks in the list in column 1? I don't see how daily or weekly tasks are managed by the system.<br>Do one always have to judge personally the timing to accomplish a task? I ask that because simply starting doing something often brings me to do just that thing for hours, so that I don't finish other important tasks that I wanted to do in that day. That happens because usually I have complex tasks that require many actions, they're not one go operations. So the try&error is necessary and to reach a good flow is hard. Unfortunately that often brings me to loose myself in details, and that breaks the system and brings me to feel like a hamster running on his wheel: I do many things, but not in the right order, damn!<br>I hope that all this makes sense.</div>
</div>

Then set a timer for that amount of time.</div>

<div>My mistake.<br>Of course I meant Super Focus.<br><br>I suspected the answer would be the one you gave. Makes a lot of sense.<br><br>I think, rather than going back to Outlook, I may try and put these tasks in the back of the notebook and work forward till I meet the current task list. I would just have to hang on to the old notebooks.<br><br>I have given up on computerized task lists a while ago for all of the reasons you have mentioned before.</div>

<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Alan Baljeu - 2011-10-12 1:18</div>
<div>On your major project, you could have everything else in SuperFocus or AF4, and like Mark says: work an hour on the project, take a break and do something or two from the list, then resume the big task. <br><br>When you don't have the deadline, learn to apply Mark's principle of working "little and often". Instead of getting sucked into one chore to the exclusion of others, do a little of that project, switch to another thing, and keep coming back to the big chore. The effect should be the chore is accomplished, and a lot of other little things at the same time. To focus exclusively on one thing for a while is fine when nothing else presses, but generally it's a better balance to switch things up. <br><br>About daily, weekly things: keep them separate. When the day comes to work something, you can add them then.</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Lorenzo - 2011-10-12 12:33</div>
<div>Thanks Mark. I've quickly gone through your different methods AF1-2-3-4, and I found that AF3 could fit well with my two default "states": 1 Job running 2 Research and Studies, with "backward" used for the first and "forward" and "review" for the second.<br>But I also like the simplicity of the last Superfocus method. I'd like to read also previous SF versions, but I've decided to stop planning and start from the last SF and start right now.<br>I keep other methods for future alternatives, if probelms will arise with SF.<br>About the timer, I'm going to try it. Problem is that coming like many people from the experience of keeping stricly hour-regulated workdays, I developed a "special skill" in skipping alarms.. time will tell if I'm strong enough to educate myself to that.<br>To also reply to Alan comment, I think that my attitude of loosing myself in single activities could be breaked from enjoying the little and often principle. Infact, I think that that principle alone is one of the most important fuel to the system! My fear for that though is that I could end in further fragmenting my targets preventing them to be accomplished.<br>But for now, I'm going to stop guessing and start acting. Maybe I'll add more comments as I keep going. For daily, weekly, and fixed hour tasks I'll trust on my paper agenda, then entering tasks on column 1 or 2 depending on the urgency.<br>Ok thank you guys, it's a pleasure to be here and recieve your comments!<br>Mark I put in the list "traduce SF in italian" :)</div>

<div>Hello Mark,<br><br>I've been really enjoying using Superfocus this week and it all seems very clear and is working well for me.  The only thing I'm wondering is what happens with reading.  If I'm reading a book and I finish a session do I put 'Read Julian Barnes' at the END of the entire list (because reading is a recurring task) or do I put it in column two of the next page because the book is not finished.  But then if I do the latter and 'cheat' because I'm no longer in work mode (the evening comes and all my tasks on page one are work related and I want to relax for example) so I end up reading another few pages before I officially get to work on the following page, I end up deleting an item in column two, page two, before I've even moved to page two 'officially' if you see what I mean.  <br><br>Thanks for your thoughts on this.  I am finding that I'm completing tasks not on my official page when I'm in more 'relaxed' mode - perhaps I've made the mistake of putting too many work-related tasks on page one!<br><br>I've added the distinction that when a task is going to become urgent but isn't yet, it gets a small asterisk, so the next day I can scan the asterixed tasks to easily find what needs to go in column two for that day...<br><br>Thanks for this great system.  For a long time I shied away from it, but it seems to be working for me now - and look forward to your new book!<br>Jacqui</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Alan Baljeu - 2011-10-22 3:29</div>
<div>You define when something is done. If you want to finish the bOok ASAP, then define done as "finished the book". Instead you can write " finish a chapter" or "read 10 pages" or "read until you have had enough for today".  In such cases, you can reenter the task at the end  It's up to you.</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Lorenzo - 2011-10-22 10:34</div>
<div>Alan: thanks for your hints. I've came to the point to be very careful about column 2. Especially now that I still have to get through many backlogs in column 1, I need to circulate more through pages (I've got 3 pages). And having wrong items in column 2 can be very inconvenient for this flow.<br><br>Jacqui: I'm also new to SF (not two weeks yet), and I also noted what you're talking about. I tend to finish tasks in other colums than the active one too. This happen to me especially when I try to optimize similar tasks, or things to do in close places in town. EX if I entered two errands in different pages but close places, I'll do the two and delete those. In fact, it doesn't seem so smart not to do something just because I'm not in the right page.<br>I keep the pages as references and try to follow those, but then when I feel it's right, I just do something without regret ;)<br>About relaxing time, I don't put items in the list. It seems inconsistent to me to relax with a todo list. Relax is relax, can't follow rules to me. If you want to read a book but in relax time you don't read it, the reason is that reading that book isn't relax, so you shouldn't do it in that time.</div>

<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Seraphim - 2011-10-22 15:02</div>
<div>Jacqui - Regarding the book - It depends on how you are thinking about the book.  If you have in mind a goal to finish the book, then perhaps using Column 2 is best.  But if you have in mind "do some light reading in between tasks", then perhaps treating it as a recurring task is best.   <br><br>Regarding "cheating" -- there's nothing that says you must be "all SuperFocus, all the time".   I've seen several people on this list using SF strictly during work, but then take a more relaxed approach during "off hours".<br><br>You might also want to explore some of the other ideas presented on the lists for separating work from personal tasks -- such as the stalagmite/stalactite approach, or use the front of the notebook for work, and the back for personal, etc.</div>

<div>Lorenzo:<br><br><< In fact, it doesn't seem so smart not to do something just because I'm not in the right page. >><br><br>The problem with this is that if you keep breaking the rules, then the rules cease to provide the framework for you to get things done. All the rules are there for a purpose, If you just do things when you feel them, then you might as well have one long list and forget about rules altogether.<br><br><< About relaxing time, I don't put items in the list. It seems inconsistent to me to relax with a todo list.>><br><br>This is a personal preference and there is nothing wrong with using SF (or any other system) for work only. However there is a difference between "relax" and "personal", and for those of us who have shelves full of half-read books having a more systematic way of reading books may be very useful.</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Jacqui Lofthouse - 2011-10-23 23:19</div>
<div>Thanks Mark, Alan, Lorenzo and Seraphim.  Alan, I like the idea of breaking things down into smaller chunks and Seraphim, I also like the idea that it depends on whether finishing that book is a goal or a way to relax, so one can put it in column two for the former and as a recurring task for the latter.  For me, the idea that 'one doesn't have to be on superfocus all the time' is useful - but that when I AM on superfocus, I am following the rules.  Being careful about column two is an interesting point.  Seraphim, I have rewritten my list using stalagmite/stalactite as suggested and think this will work much better and is clearer to see what I need to do for work which is helpful.  <br><br>I feel that there is probably a middle point between Lorenzo and Mark's view above. (Lorenzo, good to find someone else who is fairly new to it!)  I think it is helpful to try really hard to focus on the rules, but I also think that in life, assuming that one is not on superfocus 'all' the time, it is inevitable that something will get done from a future page (unless one always pulls it back to column two to say 'this is actually 'urgent' right now).  I agree that it's useful to have a framework for personal tasks, absolutely, and I try to read far too many books at once, so I do like the idea of some kind of framework for this.  I'm looking forward to continuing to play with this - in particular I'm looking forward to the fact that I won't be able to procrastinate about certain tasks that I tend to put off for more 'urgent' ones.  Thanks Mark!</div>

<div>Mark:<br><br><<if you keep breaking the rules, then the rules cease to provide the framework for you to get things done.>><br><br>I believe you.

About that, you reccomended in DIT to stop working everyday at the same time. I try to do it, and often I switch to "personal" tasks when I don't go out or just relax.

What do you reccomend about that?</div>

<div>Alan:<br><br>That's right. That's an alternative way of doing it. But Lorenzo did ask specifically about a reordering phase that would permit coupling similar tasks that are more easily done together.</div>

<div>RE Groceries and reordering, etc.<br><br>This used to be a big issue for me also - not just for groceries, but for smallish projects.   <br><br>Example:  Let's say there are four or five tasks related to a project, and they get entered into the list as they come to mind, or perhaps when emails pertaining to the project appear in my in box.   <br><br>As I process my list, I come across one of them.   It creates some mental dissonance, because I know there are other related tasks in my list, some of which may or may not need to be done first, or in conjunction with this current task.   But I can't remember what those tasks are, and I can't remember where they are in the list -- or even if they ARE in the list!   Maybe they are just in the back of my mind.<br><br>I could always pull out a folder or a separate project sheet and map out the tasks there -- but for smallish projects, this always seemed like too much overhead.   I could easily have 15-20 such projects going on simultaneously, each with only a handful of related tasks -- and then I need a way to integrate this project-tracking system into SF.   More mental dissonance.<br><br>This was the main driver behind using project pages in my system.   Instead of having just standard AF/SF pages, I intersperse project pages together with the AF/SF pages.   When I realize a task is part of a larger project, I'd move it to one of these project pages -- creating the new page if needed.<br><br>What's really nice about this approach is that these projects are cycled through just like everything else, giving all the benefits of SF/AF, little and often, frequent repeated exposure, etc. -- but all the related tasks are kept together.</div>

It seems to me a bit of a formal issue, but all right. That's better then breaking rules for nothing.<br><br><<I'm not sure from your description what it is that's now preventing you from ending your workday at a specific time. Perhaps you could make it a bit clearer.>><br><br>Nothing is preventing, I finish at the usual hour, and I switch to personal tasks. Problem is that having already worked on personal tasks during the day my free time become very similar to working day, and that sometimes makes me a bit sick. I guess I should just relax or differentiate activities.</div>

<div>Lorenzo:<br><br>If you want to keep personal tasks separate from work tasks the easiest solution is to have two lists.</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Mark Forster - 2011-10-24 18:14</div>
<div>Seraphim:<br><br>My usual method of dealing with smallish projects for which it's too much overhead to open a separate project file or list is to _both_ enter the individual tasks as I think of them _and_ enter the project itself. So I can either pick the tasks off as I come to them, or work on the project as a whole.<br><br>If I come on a task called "Work on Project X", I will simply head a piece of paper "Project X" and write down everything I can think of that needs doing now. As I work on the list, I will add anything else I think of. Once I've done as much work as I want to I'll re-enter the overall task in the Unfinished column if I want to. Otherwise I'll junk the project list and re-enter at the end of the main list.<br><br>Making an ad hoc list in this way is a very flexible and effective way of working for a project which doesn't need formal documentation.</div>

<div>The idea of adding separate lists for single projects is great as a project manager for my hottest days. But I think I will pause my regular SF list and switch back at delivery time.<br>But for regular projects that do not need particular precedence, I don't think that separating things would be so good. Infact I like having just one list where I can have all under control.<br>Anyway, I miss some project specific "interface", I hope the next system would include them.

<div><<Re groceries: It seems better to take buy bread and write it on a separate list. Ditto for butter. Then buy stuff can be one item to do.>><br><br>Alan I didn't mean just shopping items in the list. For ex if I go out for errands and I realize I'm passing through my old aunt's neighborhood and she owes me 500 €, I could consider to make a quick call to her even if I wrote that commission two pages ahead. Especially for quick tasks, shoud be a good idea to do them if I can save time. Living in a big city usually push people to make similar choices too. Probably I'm going to modify the list *after* doing things. So it doesn't break the rules, but it sounds a bit like a cheat. Infact it's not that "Call my aunt" is really becoming urgent. That is only trying to optimize time.<br>Also, I could not make another list "go do in town", cause I enter items in the lists when I recall them, so they could be in different pages.<br>Finally I think that column 2 is for "urgent and reordered tasks" that I want to couple. That should work better for me, so I don't feel I'm cheating.</div>

<div>I often do tasks that are not on the current page.  I do restrain myself in this, as it's valuable to go through the pages according to the rules.  But if something comes up like calling your aunt, and it just makes sense to do now, I'll do it.  And when I find it in the list, I mark it done.<br><br>Also, if it comes to it, I will make a list that includes: buy bread, buy milk, get haircut, visit aunt.<br><br>So absolutely keep doing what works, Lorenzo!</div>

<div>Alan:<br><br><< But if something comes up like calling your aunt, and it just makes sense to do now, I'll do it. And when I find it in the list, I mark it done. >><br><br>1. So you had "Call Aunt" on your list, but you hadn't done it yet because either:<br><br>a. you hadn't reached that task yet (because it wasn't in C2)<br><br>OR<br><br>b. you had passed by it one or more times<br><br>Both of these suggest a certain amount of reluctance to do the task.<br><br>And then "something comes up" that means in spite of your previous reluctance you felt the need to call her immediately. Presumably that "something" was a message from her on your Voicemail demanding to know why she hadn't heard from you for so long and threatening to cut you out of her will.<br><br>I guess that would qualify as an Immediate emergency, which doesn't need to be written on the list anyway!</div>

<div>That is one scenario Mark. The other is what Lorenzo wrote: something came up which made the action more expedient now: going into town. Indeed if instead of "call", it was "visit" then the point is clearer. The visiting task can be copied onto the "grocery" list as a convenient package of in-town tasks.</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Mark Forster - 2011-10-27 13:54</div>
<div>Alan:<br><br>So you only visit your aunt because you've decided to do some shopping, rather than doing some shopping because you've decided to visit your aunt.<br><br>No wonder she's contemplating cutting you out of her will!</div>

<div>For those of you that want a small notebook that fits in a pocket, try a mini composition notebook.  Here is an example on Amazon:<br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Top-Flight-Mini-Marble-Shrink-Wrapped-06351/dp/B003I869CO" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Top-Flight-Mini-Marble-Shrink-Wrapped-06351/dp/B003I869CO</a><br>Or check your local dollar store or Walmart.  Walmart has these for under $1 per book.  Dollar stores often have multi-packs of them for $1.  They are 3.25" x 4.5", with room for 18 items on a page.<br><br>They are small, so you would probably have to use the left pages for column 1 and the right pages as column 2.</div>

<div>One of my tasks might be "email my supplier requesting a quote for such-and-such item".  After I complete that task, I want to make sure I get a response from the supplier.  How do I handle these types of items that I am waiting on from other sources?  I don't want to put it in column 2, because I don't want it holding me up from moving to the next page.  Sometimes the quotes may be complex and could take a week or more for the supplier to put it all together.</div>

<div>Add an entry to C1 as "follow-up supplier X" if it can be done whenever it "stands out" or add it to your calendar if it needs doing on a specific date.</div>

<div>This is a good idea and I already sort of do this but I only have the one column. I'm going to add the second one for those urgent tasks. For those asking about getting through the page I would probably say to number them in order of importance (1 being most important and going down from there) after you've written them all out?<br><br>I take it that not all of these need to be completed in a day as you are constantly adding to the list.</div>

<div>Hi Mark,<br><br>Thank you so much for sharing SuperFocus, I know it's old now but I've only just stumbled upon it last week. I've tried a few of your other systems and read all of your books, but SuperFocus is amazing and I feel like this could be the one I stick with long term.<br><br>SF is working really well for me but I a few questions that I couldn't find addressed in the rules or the comments.<br><br>#1: Multiple concurrently running tasks<br><br>I'm often working on a task like building a Windows server, where I click “Install” and then have to wait 30 minutes before I can click again, so I will work on another task at the same time. The task of installing Windows is something that I want to keep working on until it is done, but it's a stop-start-stop-start task. So for example I may click on “Install”, and then while I'm waiting for that component to install (which could take 30-60 minutes) I start working on another task.<br><br>There are 3 options that I can think of, just wondering what your thoughts are?<br><br>- Would I cross off “Install server” and re-enter it on column 2 of the active page?<br>- Or just not cross it off yet because I'm “still actively working on it, even though I'm not touching it right in this moment, and am working on another thing too” ?<br><br>#2: Urgent tasks when column 1 of the active page isn't full<br><br>The scenario is that you're have a page where column 1 isn't yet full, you're working on tasks from this page and also entering new tasks onto this same page. When something comes up that you want to work on straight away, would you enter that task in column 1, or column 2?<br><br>#3: Unfinished tasks with only 1 active page<br><br>And a second question that is similar, suppose you do some work on a task, but don't finish it. But you only have one active page. Do you re-enter the task on column 2 of the same page? (this may only be a question that comes up for people that have just started with SuperFocus, and don't yet have a bunch of pages)<br><br>Thanks,<br>Dan</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Mark Forster - 2018-04-27 19:34</div>
<div>Dan Mundy:<br><br>I'm glad you like Superfocus. I think there's still quite a few people using it.<br><br>In the case you mention of installing Window, I personally would treat it as a finished task, but come back to it as and when it needed attention. This sort of thing happens quite often to normal non-IT people like myself, and I've always just done what is necessary when it's necessary without creating a new task.<br><br>In answer to your second question, if I remember rightly the rules say somewhere that urgent tasks on the last page should be entered in Column 1 rather than Column 2 while there is space available. This would obviously apply to your case.</div>
