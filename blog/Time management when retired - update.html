<h1>Time management when retired - update</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2010-04-30 16:09</div>
<div class="content"><p>I think it’s time to write an update on how my new system for retirees (and non-retirees) is getting on. I’ve had quite a ride with it because my original idea didn’t work out, but further experimentation has resulted in something which I think is going to work very well.</p>
<p>Basically it is a system which combines the best bits of DIT, the AFs and DWM:</p>
<ol>
<li>Like DIT it is based on one day’s work, but it incorporates several improvements to make it more flexible.</li>
<li>Like AF it dismisses stuff which you aren’t prepared to do, but does so much more directly.</li>
<li>Like AF4 it works on a “backlog” and a “current” list, but ensures that this is related to one day’s work.</li>
<li>Like DWM stuff which isn’t done within a certain number of days gets dismissed, but without the endless page turning.</li>
<li>And best of all it puts the screws on very quickly with the important stuff, while allowing the urgent less important stuff to flow quickly.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you can imagine DIT with the problem solved of what to do when you don’t finish all today’s tasks, you’ll be pretty close.</p></div>

<div>Wow, that looks to have a lot of promise, Mark.<br><br>However, I can't imagine how it would be done =(<br><br>Oh well, I guess we'll have to wait ^___^<br><br>Good luck on that new TM technique, Mark!</div>

<div>I'm very keen to hear about your new system, Mark. In recent weeks, I've ping-ponged between DWM (which I couldn't get away with), AF4 (got overwhelmed by the list and having to choose which task to work on) and DIT which I've gone back to happily using now. I find it to be the system most suited to my style of working. <br><br>My problem is that some days lots of potential tasks arise, without the opportunity to do them all the next day. I try to spread them out over the next week or two in my Task Diary but doing this too often breaks the principle of one day's input equals one day's work, creating a bigger potential for backlogs.</div>

<div>Linda:<br><br>I hope that what I'm working on at the moment will help overcome this problem.But I've got to test it out further myself in its present form.</div>

<div>I agree with Linda I loved and am using most of the techniques in DIT (and Get Everything Done!) but the one thing that I don't like is scheduling work  - even just writing a task list for tomorrow sets me up for a backlog and failure when something takes longer than I bargained for (which it always does!).   I love AF4 as I always know where to write things that pop up while I'm working I can just jot them down at the end of the list. I only used DWM to add expiry dates to tasks rather than write them on separate pages. I can't wait to find out your new method. <br><br>I'm very pleased that you're still sharing :)<br><br>Val S</div>

<div>Val:<br><br>The new system is a sort of combination of DIT and AF4 with a few extras thrown in!</div>

<div>David:<br><br>Hopefully it won't be too long - but that does depend on my not running into any problems. And problems usually only surface after some time.</div>

<div class="comment-meta">David Drake - 2010-04-30 23:29</div>
<div>And can one still use their AF list -- i.e one long list, or is it now different?<br><br>-David</div>

<div>It will be the same as DIT and DWM - a page a day diary/schedule.</div>

<div>Mark: You had me at "it's like AF"! I await with eagerness of a kind I see in my young children when they are about to open their birthday present. AF has been my choice to date, and I always liked DIT, so I am looking forward to seeing the morphed system.</div>

<div>Hmm, interesting, I wonder how you will improve on DWM, which I've found very good. After reading some earlier comments, I have just looked at taking the first task which stands out, then looking further till a task stands out more - this approach looks worth trying - but I gather you are experimenting with something different now.<br><br>Look forward to hearing more soon. There is always room for improvement, in any system.</div>

<div>Sounds good, Mark.  I have a nice Moleskin diary ready to go -- I was using it when working with DWM, which I found to not like as well.  I am using Autofocus 1 now and loving it.  But I certainly am excited about your new pending system and will try it out.<br><br>-David</div>

<div>It's not going quite as well as I'd hoped, so it'll probably be a while yet.</div>

<div>Sorry to hear that, Mark.  Keep at it....and am sure you will do so!  Meanwhile, I am enjoying Autofocus 1 so very much!<br><br>-David</div>

<div>David:<br><br>I agree - in many ways AF1 was my favourite too.</div>

<div class="comment-meta">David Drake - 2010-05-3 23:26</div>
<div>Yep -- it is going to be hard to beat Autofocus 1, Mark.  It is an incredibly motivating and brilliant system...<br><br>-David</div>

<div><< I agree - in many ways AF1 was my favourite too. >><br><br>Just for kicks I started today treating my AF4 list in the AF1 manner.  Boy, did I rock those tasks today.  I wasn't necessarily engaging with the AF4 list properly anyway, since the length can be so dynamic between closed and open.  AF1 pages were very refreshing and finite.</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">David Drake - 2010-05-4 22:10</div>
<div>Hi Brian,<br><br>This is exactly why I came back to AF1 -- I do like the separate pages.  Autofocus 1 has been working so very well for me!<br><br>-David</div>

<div>Brian:<br><br><< Just for kicks I started today treating my AF4 list in the AF1 manner. >><br><br>That's interesting. Can you give a little more detail of how you did that? Was it just the "backlog" that you did this with?</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Brian - 2010-05-6 17:38</div>
<div>Mark, I just scanned my AF4 pages by the AF1 rules (one page at a time).  More pressure to act on older items in order to move to the next page.  I hadn't been following AF4 very tightly, so I had been adding more than I had been acting.</div>

<div>Hello Mark - as a new retiree, having tried to adapt various of your systems to my new life style and abandoned them...  well I am very keen to hear from you!  How's it going?  Can we trial it for you and see what the problems are of which you speak?!</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Mark Forster - 2010-06-12 13:14</div>
<div>David:<br><br>I've been finding it a lot more difficult to get right than I expected. So don't expect any details in the near future!<br><br>ChrisY:<br><br>It's not really possible to put something out for trial until it's reached a fairly stable state. Otherwise by the time people send in their comments, I'm already doing something different. I'm still working on it though!</div>

<div>Hello David,<br><br>I like the systems you've developed so far, as I find them to be better than GTD in some ways.  I very curious to know more the system you're currently working on, I am using DIT at the moment.  Hope to hear more soon!<br><br>Best regards,<br>Helgi Þór</div>

<div>J'ai lu un peu AF4 et DWM, j'ai mis un temps avant de bien comprendre. Je teste depuis peu DWM, donc je ne peux me permettre de dire pour l'instant. J'avoue qu'il se peut que je triche un peu pour ne pas laisser les listes toutes périr. Et je me donne dans la mesure du possible 1 ou 2 tâches à faire par jour. Je trouve que c'est chouette ce que vous faites !<br><br>I read a little AF4 and DWM, I did a time before understand (because I don't speak, read, very good english). I try a few time DWM, so I can't to say what I think now. ....<br>I find it's great what you do !</div>
</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Mark Forster - 2010-08-3 15:17</div>
<div>Merci, Eoline. J'espere que DWM fonctionne bien pour vous.</div>

<div>When will this new system be posted?</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Alan Baljeu - 2010-08-6 22:48</div>
<div>As Mark has said previously, he'll post it when it works, which could be months.  Meanwhile, I suppose he's experimenting with ideas until something effective emerges.</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">E.M. Shanty - 2010-08-7 20:37</div>
<div>Yes, well, Alan, this post was published over three months ago, and Mark's most recent comment was almost two months ago. So "near future" is a subjective concept, isn't it?</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Mark Forster - 2010-08-7 21:30</div>
<div>Actually I thought my most recent comment was on August 3rd.</div>
