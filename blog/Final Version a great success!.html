<h1>Final Version a great success!</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2012-03-31 7:22</div>
<div class="content"><p>The Final Version has now gone out to over 4,000 subscribers and the feed-back has been uniformly good. It seems to have really caught people’s imagination.</p>
<p>I’m now in the process of writing the second issue of the <em>Final Version newsletter</em> which should be out in a few days.</p>
<p>Other projects which are featuring large in my FV list are getting the booking opened and other preparations finalized for the <a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/seminars/">Q & A session on 16th April</a> and drawing up a schedule of further teleconfence calls and seminars.</p></div>

<div>Cilla<br><br>The instructions are sent out in batches several times a day, but as I'm in Australia at the moment my day is probably not your day. If you have not received the instructions within 24 hours of signing up, please email me at mf@markforster.net</div>

<div>Mark:  One of your initial posts illustrating the FV showed pages from a loose leaf notebook (many were guessing about what the "dots" were for).  The notebook looked very nice and appeared to be leather.  What kind (brand?) of notebook was it and where can you buy them?<br><br>Marshall</div>

<div>I like the final version, although I sometimes find myself not finishing the mini-list and therefore not getting to the harder, but often more important, tasks.  I think I need to be more flexible with the mini-list, with the big goal of getting the One Big Goal done regardless of the rest. <br><br>I was surprised to see you back to experimenting with af4 type stuff.  The final version wasn't final then?  I am trying to solidify my style and get out of meta-work and into actual work, so chasing yet more ideas seems counterproductive for me personally at this point in my life ... unless of course you come up with something that is just incredibly better.</div>
