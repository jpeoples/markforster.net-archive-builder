<h1>Diet report</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2006-12-11 11:20</div>
<div class="content"><p>Today for the first time I crept a little above my <a href="/blog/2006/12/4/can-i-improve-on-the-no-s-diet.html">target weight </a>for the day. It was only half a pound, but nevertheless it triggered the first rule "No Seconds". This is the easiest rule on my list. Will it be enough to bring me back to the target weight, especially as the target reduces by 1/2 lb tomorrow? We will see!</p><p>Anyway up to now my diet has consisted of eating exactly what I normally eat, in the quantities I normally eat, and when I normally eat. I can't complain that it's been hard work!</p></div>

<div>Good luck with your experiment! I remember reading/hearing somewhere that your weight today reflects what you ate 3 days ago. Or something to that effect. So what you eat (or don't eat) today may affect your weight 3 days from now. The bottom line being: no immediate results! So, stay the  course.<br><br>Good luck!</div>

<div>Thanks, Mike. I've always found that if I eat a lot one day it's reflected on the scales the next day. So perhaps the 3 day rule only applies when the weight is coming off!</div>
