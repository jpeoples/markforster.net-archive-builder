<div class="meta">Posted: 2008-12-19 23:52</div>
<div class="content"><p>One further word on how I’m getting on with the new method: today I had 66 new tasks of which I completed 36. That means that I achieved a same-day completion rate of 55 per cent.</p>
<p>That is much faster than “Do It Tomorrow”, in which only urgent items are allowed to be done the same day.</p>
<p>I’ll update you tomorrow evening on how many of the remaining 30 items I succeed in completing tomorrow.</p></div>

<div>This sounds great, Mark.  I can't wait to try this out!  <br><br>Take care,<br>-David</div>

<div>I'm not so sure to understand how you measure the performance of your system. IMHO the performance should not be seen in terms of quantity of action performed but rather on number of actions that are postponed (actions that you are aware of and actions you are not fully aware off).<br>So I think you'll do a far better demonstration if you achieve at not letting anything behind.<br>And I have to agree that's quite impossible to demonstrate fully...<br>That's why a system has to be experienced to understand if it's really efficient, and if this system can be applied/adapted in another situation for another person.<br>I eager to see exactly what your new system is, but just with the few description lines on your first post I'm really ineterested in reading more ;)<br>Good luck !</div>

<div>Cyril:<br><br>You are right in what you say - and I am fully aware of it. However it is too early at the moment to be able to report on the sort of things that you mention. Quantity on the other hand is easy to measure so that is what I am concentrating now.<br><br>One of the things which I am looking at today is to identify the things which I am most resisting in my life. I intend to feed them into the system.and see what happens to them.</div>

<div>Mark,<br><br>For those of us who are being tortured by your daily updates <grin>, would you consider a small, private group of beta testers to help you refine your system?<br><br>You could set it up so that the testers should not divulge any details of the system without your consent and, in return for an early look, they must provide feedback and suggestions for improvement. <br><br>At least, you wouldn't be releasing it to the entire world before making sure it has some field-testing and credibility. And it would put some of us out of our misery.<br><br>Naturally, I would like to volunteer!</div>

<div>I too would be very interested in beta testing. I adopted DIT as published about 9 months ago and found it made a big difference, particularly in getting in control of e-mail. However, I am still conscious that there are problems with my system, particularly due to the big fluctuations I see in my incoming work, as I have posted before. I have tried the modified DIT that you posted about a month ago, and didn't get on with it at all. For me it was much more unstable than conventional DIT: I probably achieved more when things were going well, but it was easier to overwhelm the system. I have now gone back to the conventional version, with some tweaks.</div>

<div>Jaroslav:<br><br>It will take me two weeks minimum to see if it really works for me - and then I will invite people to join as beta testers.</div>

<div>When you're done with the beta testing, please sell it as an eBook so that it can get out faster. I can imagine that the time to go to press as a traditional book in bookstores may be much longer.</div>

<div>Wilson:<br><br>It's too early to make any decisions about how it will be distributed. But it wouldn't take more than a page or two to describe it, so a conventional book is probably not the way to go. No promises though!</div>

<div>Hi Mark<br>Not to be the fly in the ointment, but.....<br>If I'm not paralyzed with pain or sleeping, I'm doing something....is quality involved in the matrix?  That is usually my deciding factor to evaluate my successes.  If I'm in pain, the effort expended must be worth enduring the pain as well as expending effort and focus(yes, focus depletes easily in pain situations!)<br>When I'm blessed with my pain abating, I want to make DAMN SURE I'm choosing well as not to waste my small window of living "normally".  Either way, quality always wins out. I'm always carefully choosing how to expend my energy and focus....even during my down time (when I don't have to dope myself up!  LOL!)<br>Does your experminent measure that as well?<br>gsdsmiles</div>

<div>Hi Mark<br>I apologize for the above post as pain medications render me as rather inarticulate.  Bottom line: Because my resourses are painfully low, I must aim for actions that support my quality of life or quality of character.  I'm not aiming to see how many things I can tick off a list.  I must aim for the biggest bang for the buck actions!  LOL!<br>Maybe my meds are puttying my brain, but I don't see how you're deciding what your list consists of....and why it's on there.....Am I being obtuse or daft?<br>gsdsmiles</div>

<div>Thanks Mark. My apologies. I thought you were working full steam ahead on some new follow-up book to DIT.<br><br>In any case, it's always good to see that you're not resting on your laurels and are really interested in furthering your studies and development in your techniques.</div>

<div>gsdsmiles:<br><br>The reason I am quoting figures for quantity is that quantity is easily measurable and quality is not. My hope is that with this new system the system itself will sift what I put in it to produce the quality. So far that seems to be the case. I am also deliberately trying to see what happens if I overload the system, which is a major problem with all other systems. This one seems to be able to take it in its stride.</div>
