<div>This is perfect timing for me to return to Autofocus—the most addictive approach of all of your approaches. I have completed a huge project and now have lots of smaller tasks to attend to. I’ll be using my iPad Pro to try it out. Thanks for continuing to share your experiments!</div>

<div>Mark<br><br>Sorry if this comes over as pedantic. I only raise the point in case I am missing something important. How have you gone from 33 tasks per page on report #1 to 31 on report #2? Are you just making sure we’re paying attention?<br><br>Melanie,<br><br>Out of interest, what app are you using?<br><br>Ian</div>

<div>Oh la la… Melanie Wilson!!! Nice to see you here. <br><br>I’m very close to trying this out via paper pen. To this day, there’s still a special place in my heart (brain?) for Autofocus. Dig the new rule(s) as well.</div>

<div>@Ian S, I’m using Good Notes.<br><br>@avrum Good to see you! Hope you are well.<br><br>@Mark Forster I am already breaking the rules a bit by doing whichever tasks I please, regardless of which page they are on. I do return to the first page when I’m not sure what to do, however. I also read through the whole list this morning. So far, so good!</div>

<div>My intention was to try AF (again) with Mark's new rule. However I never made it past the contemplation phase. I have a system that works very well, and I'd prefer to not overly complicate my current workflow. What I have done is borrowed some of the spirit of AF (and D. Allen's "Brain Dump") and created one long list of whatever is on my mind. That process alone settles the nerves. It also serves as a backup for whatever I might want to return to.</div>

<div>As a huge fan of AF1 I have just started trying this yesterday. I find the highlighted items TOO distracting / standing out when I come to them. I accept this is the point but I like the simplicity of pencil and paper and nothing else. So I am trying an asterisk against the item * for yellow and a second asterisk ** for orange if I ever get there.</div>

<div>skeg:<br><br><< I find the highlighted items TOO distracting / standing out when I come to them. >><br><br>There's nothing sacred about the yellow and orange highlighting. They just happened to be the colours that I had highlighters for. You can mark them up in any way you like - asterisks are fine.</div>
