<div>Hi Mark<br>The only sites I allow myself to visit when I'm taking a break from working are this site and matt cornell's site....besides the news.  Some of the other productivity sites are too distracting whereas your's and matt's keep me in work mode yet refresh my mind.<br>Thank you!<br>learning as I go</div>
