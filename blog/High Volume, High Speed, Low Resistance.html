<h1>High Volume, High Speed, Low Resistance</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2017-07-1 23:52</div>
<div class="content"><p>Just to wet your appetites I’m about to start the final testing of the high volume, high speed, low resistance system which I’ve been working on for the last few months. The aim of this method is to enable you to do <em>anything</em> and <em>everything</em>, with minimum resistance. I’m very hopeful that I have succeeded.</p>
<p>Some of the characteristics of the system are: </p>
<ul>
<li>Urgent tasks can be accessed at any time without bending or breaking the rules</li>
<li>Whatever the size of the list, scanning for the next task takes minimal time</li>
<li>It is very suited to “little and often” working</li>
<li>Any size of list can be handled</li>
<li>Equal attention is paid to all parts of the list</li>
<li>The system itself provides momentum</li>
<li>There is no provision for dismissal as this is unnecessary </li>
</ul>
<p>I’m starting testing tomorrow with my existing list which is spread across pages of 31 lines each. The number of active tasks currently on each page is as follows:</p>
<p>1 - 1</p>
<p>2 - 0</p>
<p>3 - 2</p>
<p>4 - 3</p>
<p>5 - 6</p>
<p>6 - 5</p>
<p>7 - 6</p>
<p>8 - 1</p>
<p>9 - 1</p>
<p>10 - 13</p>
<p>11- 18</p>
<p>Total: 56</p>
<p>Please note: </p>
<ol>
<li>This page distribution was produced by a different system</li>
<li>The pages are only being recorded for test puposes. The system does not use pages - it is just one long list and therefore ideally suited for electronic implementation.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>

<div>Can't wait, Mark. Are you going to reveal the whole system here, or reserve it for the book?</div>

<div>Sounds exciting! Looking forward to more!</div>

<div>hi Mark,<br>Wish you a fast recovery of all your health issues,and  wishes for  your New BOOK to create records. Bring revolution.<br>Mark I would request you to say something as a critic to another well known, proclaimed as successful, catch all system which I doubt can be implemented as guided, Its getting things done by David Allen.</div>

<div>Martin Williams:<br><br>I intend to reveal it here - assuming it survives the testing of course!</div>

<div>Hi Mark, what about giving us a preliminary version of the instructions, so we can test the new system along with you?</div>
</div>

<div>nick61:<br><br>Sorry, I'm not ready to do that yet.</div>

<div>Can I request a feature which deals with those who have less than desirable skills of natural task selection.....</div>
</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Mark Forster - 2017-07-3 18:19</div>
<div>MrBacklog:<br><br>Since my expience so far with this system is that just about every task gets worked on during the course of the day, it doesn't really matter much what order you do them in.</div>

<div>I'd like to learn the details even if it doesn't survive testing. A successful experiment is one that we learn from.</div>

<div>Mark, your results remind me of a system which I tried for myself und which has worked very good for me: I start working my todolist from the first unactioned item and work at least one minute on this item (or as long as I want to). <br><br>If the item can not be worked on right now (e.g. wrong time or wrong place) I skip it and continue with the next unactioned item.<br><br>If I worked on a task, but did not complete it, I cross it out and add it to the end of the list (sometimes rephrased or the "next action"). In many cases this proves to be a good antidote against procrastination. Since it is enough to "start working on it" or "figure out the next action step" there is almost no resistance against items, that have been on my agenda for a long time. Work a little or think a little, cross it out and reenter it (maybe as a rephrased, better version) at the end.<br><br>If an urgent action comes up during the day, that has to be dealt with RIGHT NOW, I add it to the end of the list and jump right to it. As soon as I'm finished with it, I start with the next pass on page one (the oldest page with unactioned items), since no new items are below this line.<br><br>If I realize that a task on my list has become so urgent, that it has to be processed right now, I cross out my current activity, reenter it at the end of the list (if necessary) and jump right to the urgent item. After I finished it (or come to the conclusion that I have worked long enough on it) I reenter it at the end of the list (if necessary) and continue working with the next unfinished item below, until I reach the end of the list and start the next pass. <br><br>I don't know if my modus operandi is clear, so feel free to ask any questions. I wonder if the new system "High volume, high speed, low resistance" works in a similar way. :-)</div>

<div>That proves again that there are many ways to skin a cat (and many ways leading to a fast moving, consolidated todolist). I'm really looking forward to the end of your testing phase and reading about your new system.</div>

<div>Hi Mark.  Longtime reader here.  Before everything else, I'm glad to see you are still productively  experimenting with your methods despite your illness, so thanks very much for that.<br><br>Awaiting your reveal of your new system like everyone else.  I do wonder if it is related to this one?<br><a href="http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/productivity/organization/stop-procrastinating-by-speed-dating-your-tasks" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/productivity/organization/stop-procrastinating-by-speed-dating-your-tasks</a><br><br>In any case, may your health and life continue to improve!<br><br>- Ron</div>

<div>Ron, the article you shared includes a very similar approach to the burst approach to free-flowing items in Mark's book, Get Everything Done and Still Have Time to Play.</div>
