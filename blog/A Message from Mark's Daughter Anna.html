<h1>A Message from Mark's Daughter Anna</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2015-07-23 15:49</div>
<div class="content"><p>Most of you don’t know that my dad was diagnosed last year with Non-Hodgkin’s  Lymphoma. Thankfully, the treatment he received at the <strong>Leukaemia &  Lymphoma unit at University College London Hospital</strong> <span class="text_exposed_show">saved his life - a  world turned upside down is once again right side up. On 20th Sept I’m  doing a sponsored walk across six London bridges with my dad, to raise  money for the unit so patients can benefit from the research, treatment  and services offered by UCLH and have the best shot of survival. I can’t  thank them enough for what they did for my dad, but the least I can do  is walk over a bridge or two (or six). If you can, please sponsor us.  It’s for a really worthy cause.</span></p>

    <p>We’ve had a fantastic response so far with over £500 being pledged - many thanks to everyone for their generosity. Still plenty of time to go before September 20th!</p>
<p>[I’ve temporarily removed the Donate button in the right margin to prevent people from mistakenly using it to donate to this Appeal. Anyone who has done so can rest assured that I will pass the money on to the Appeal with no need for further action from themselves. - Mark]</p>

<div>Hi Anna,<br><br>Your father's books and systems have been such a help (and inspiration!) for me over over the last few years. I'd be delighted to sponsor you as a small token of my gratitude. Good luck and well done. :-)</div>

<div>Great idea - you can count on me. Your father helped me so much with the systems he developed, now I can give something back</div>

<div>Will:<br><br><< I've donated £10. I confirm that I am a UK taxpayer for gift aid, if the charity is looking for that.>><br><br>Unfortunately you used the donation box in the right margin instead of the link in the blog post, and I will be unable to claim Gift Aid on that it is not a charity account. I've temporarily removed the box to prevent anyone else from making the same mistake.<br><br>We're still very grateful for your donation though!</div>

<div>Dear Anna,<br><br>I have missed this in the hurly-burly of work out here in Kampala, Uganda.  I will donate next week when I am home in the UK for two weeks and this is why . . . . <br><br>It is 20 years ago this month that my wife started her treatment for Multiple Myeloma, another cancer of the blood, treatable, not yet curable.<br><br>On 1 February 1996 Gill had an autologous bone marrow transplant (harvested from her own bone marrow five months earlier).  A tough six weeks in the BM Transplant Unit,  Every 1 February since then, we have celebrated as her 'other birthday', and in a variety of places.<br><br>She is now the longest living BMT myeloma patient in Herefordshire and beyond.  Not only has she been able to see our own children grow up, but to be Grandma to our three grandchildren (so far).<br><br>Also, she has been able to join me in many places on my work abroad, currently I am working in Kampala, Uganda.<br><br>A blessing and many thanks for prayers and bio-chemical engineering.<br><br>I have recounted this in the hope that it may bring hope to others who may be going through something similar.<br><br>Roger J</div>

<div>Roger:<br><br>Thank you very much for your promise of support. I'll pass your message on to Anna, who I know will be thrilled to hear about your wife's successful treatment. I had an autologous stem-cell transplant, which is a bit less harrowing - but yes, a "new life" is what you get!</div>

<div>Thank you for sharing your story Roger. It’s wonderful to hear your wife is still here years after her diagnosis and has had the chance to see her children grow up, meet all her grandchildren and is living life to the full. So many people are taken too early but it’s incredible the things that can be done to help so many too. <br><br>We really appreciate your support and are extremely grateful to everyone who has donated.</div>
