<h1>No Question FVP</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2017-04-29 6:49</div>
<div class="content"><p>Here’s the system I’m using at the moment, which I’m finding works very well so far.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, it’s basically <a href="../blog/The Final Version Perfected (FVP) Instructions - Reposted.html">FVP </a>without the questions.</p>
<p>As in FVP the first task on the list is always dotted.</p>
<p>You scan the list by dotting what stands out. As in FVP you then move backwards through the list to action the tasks.</p>
<p>When you have taken action on a task, you scan from that task to the end of the list without bothering to look at the preceding dotted task. When no tasks stand out you then go back to the preceding dotted task and do that.</p>
<p>In other words the basic algorithm is exactly the same as in FVP - but without asking any questions.</p>
<p>The great advantage over FVP is that the system itself requires hardly any mental effort. This makes it much faster and easier. And since the basis for selection is “standing out” there is little or no resistence to the tasks themselves.</p></div>

<div>One option could be to "scan from that task to the end of the list" only when you don't feel like doing now the last preselected task.</div>
</div>

<div>nick61:<br><br>By all means try that option to see how it works for you, but I find it doesn't work as well for me. I'm not sure why!</div>

<div>The idea is to work in pure FV mode but allowing a scan of the tail of the list whether:<br>1\ you feel resistance to the last dotted item, or<br>2\ you have the feeling that in the last part of the list something is becoming urgent...</div>

<div>Isn't there an implicit question here, along the lines of "does the task stand out more than the last dotted task"?  Or is there no 'outstandingness' sort order in the dotted tasks?<br><br>My apologies if I'm being 'outstandingly' thick here...</div>

<div>David D.<br><br>The way I'm doing it - and which works for me - is not to attempt to impose any sort of conscious order but to let the "standing out" procedure do the work for me.<br><br>I think it's the reduction in mental effort involved - rather than the logic of the algorithm - that makes it so much faster (for me) than the alternative that nick61 suggests.</div>

<div>Just for the record:<br><br>I restarted this method today (April 30) with a fresh list after experimenting with something else yesterday. During the day I entered or re-entered 176 tasks, of which I worked on 112, leaving 64 active tasks on the list at the end of the day.<br><br>I think that is the fastest I have ever succeeded in moving through a list in one day.</div>

<div>Mark Forster:<br>«not to attempt to impose any sort of conscious order but to let the "standing out" procedure do the work for me»<br><br>OK, then I'll try it out that way.  I'm just a little concerned that when the selected 'standing out' list grows beyond a day's work, the lack of prioritization will start to become a problem.<br><br>Are you currently using this system with a short ( <1day) or long ( >1day) list?</div>

<div>Apologies for wasting your time, you posted the above comment while I was thinking about my last comment...  Obviously you are using a long ( >1day) list.<br><br>Are you carrying unactioned but dotted tasks over from one day to the next?</div>

<div>David D:<br><br><< Are you currently using this system with a short ( <1day) or long ( >1day) list? >><br><br>Long. I try to have all current work on it, but I let it build up as I go along, rather than try and write everything down in one go - another instance of reducing mental effort wherever possible.<br><br>Dotted tasks are carried over.</div>

<div>Hi Mark, that seems an awful lot of tasks for 1 day.<br>I would be interested in what sort of tasks go on the list.<br>e.g. If you had 20 items of post arrive that day, would you list them all, or would those 20 items count as 1 task called "post".<br>Keen to know what granular level should be used for the task list.<br>Thanks</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Mark Forster - 2017-05-1 16:19</div>
<div>Mr Backlog:<br><br>Definitely one task called Post. <br><br>Use the level of granularity that you find suits the work. It will vary from project to project.<br><br>I suggest you read <a href="../blog/Follow Up to the Productive Day Challenge.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2015/6/9/follow-up-to-the-productive-day-challenge.html</a> and <a href="../blog/The Productive Day Challenge.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2015/6/7/the-productive-day-challenge.html</a></div>

<div class="comment-meta">Seraphim - 2017-05-2 2:02</div>
<div>Those numbers are pretty astonishing! <br><br>I am assuming this is the same kind of mix of tasks as you have had in the past?</div>

<div class="comment-meta">nuntym - 2017-05-2 2:25</div>
<div>@Mark Forster: I'm curious, are you doing "No Question Fast FVP", "Questionless FVP" like we did a couple of years ago, or something different?</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Mark Forster - 2017-05-2 9:19</div>
<div>Seraphim:<br><br>Yes, except that at the moment I'm not capable of going for long walks and runs so I have a bit more time available at the "coal face".</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Will - 2017-05-2 9:44</div>
<div>Mark, are you counting each pass of a "little and often" task as a separate task?<br><br>That is, does<br><br>Work on report<br>Work on plan<br>Work on report<br><br>count as 2 tasks or three?</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Mark Forster - 2017-05-2 17:16</div>
<div>Will:<br><br>I am counting each line on my list as one. So your example would be three.</div>
</div>

<div>nuntym:<br><br>Sorry, the answer I wrote earlier seems to have disappeared. <br><br>The method I am using is the one described in the article to which this is the comment thread.</div>

<div>I was away during the day from about 10 a.m. to 4 p.m so less time available to work on the list than in the previous two days.<br><br>Nevertheless the stats are still good.<br><br>Total of tasks on list at end of Day 3 is 368, of which 292 have been actioned, leaving 76 on the list.</div>

<div>nuntym and Mark - <br><br>It does appear to be identical with Mark's first mention of "FVP with no question at all" on June 3, 2015:<br><a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/fv-forum/post/2508019#post2509454" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/fv-forum/post/2508019#post2509454</a><br><br>It was also called:<br>AutoFocus Perfected<br>No-Question FVP<br>Questionless FVP<br>FVP-Q (as in "FVP minus the question")<br><br>Subsequent discussion posts go into a lot of depth experimenting with this and comparing to "questioned" FVP.<br><br>For example, see Mark's blog post "Dotting Power":<br><a href="../blog/Dotting Power.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2015/6/10/dotting-power.html</a><br><br>I used this method myself for quite a while, though I somehow remembered an additional step after completing a task. This extra step was "look at the last dotted task", which sets a kind of baseline, before scanning forward from the last completed item to find other things that stand out.</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Mark Forster - 2017-05-3 0:18</div>
<div>Seraphim:<br><br>You're right. I'd forgotten that. I don't think I ever followed through on it.<br><br>I found that the additional step you mention slows it down considerably and increases the mental effort required. It wasn't until I got rid of that step that it really started to move.</div>

<div>Mark:<br><br><< I found that the additional step you mention slows it down considerably and increases the mental effort required. It wasn't until I got rid of that step that it really started to move. >><br><br>Yes, I think this is the key difference between the previous incarnations of No-Question FVP, and your current system. It's amazing how such a small change can make such a big difference -- but it wouldn't be the first time we've seen that happen!</div>

<div>No totals today as I've been experimenting with using Reverse FVP as the base for this instead of FVP. <br><br><a href="../fvp_forum/Reverse FVP.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/fv-forum/post/2563635</a><br><br>So far it looks both faster and more focused.</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Chris Cooper - 2017-05-8 11:28</div>
<div>Mark, it's not clear to me from the discussion above whether you are using the Fast FVP rule: <br><br>" whenever a task is dotted which I am ready to do right now I stop scanning and do it."<br><br>As far as I can see, that would be consistent with the  NQ-FVP method as you've described it.<br><br>Chris</div>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<div class="comment-meta">Mark Forster - 2017-05-8 13:08</div>
<div>Chris Cooper:<br><br>No, I'm not using that rule. The scan is done to the end of the list each time.<br><br>See my exchange with Seraphim a few comments back on this thread.</div>

<div>I'm a new reader and recently found out about FVP, I must say that I'm grateful to have found it. It just seems like I've become much and much more productive. There are so many todolist apps there and yet this is so simple strong and effective. <br><br>I have a question, if there's a goal I work on everyday (a repeatable task basically), should I put it all the way at the top of the list all the time? Or at the bottom?</div>

<div><<< nick61:<br><br>By all means try that option to see how it works for you, but I find it doesn't work as well for me. I'm not sure why! >>><br><br>I think this is because after working on a task our inner world has changed, so the question is not only wether I have resistance to the next task in the chain, but also wether I want to do something else even more, now that I have that other task out of the way.</div>

<div class="comment-meta">Yoyorast - 2017-07-9 22:58</div>
<div>Does this give you as much focus as FV + Next hour? <br><br>I think I prefer the algorithm of FVP over FV.</div>
