<div class="content"><p>Comments are still coming in for the best answer to the question “Does using SuperFocus increase your brain power?” <a href="../blog/An Experiment.html">See the previous post.</a></p>
<p>Write a better comment than the worst of the five showing and your comment will take its place. I’m not going to say which I think that is!</p>
<p>Write a better comment than any other and <strong>your comment will be featured as a guest post on the blog</strong>. You can judge for yourself which is the best answer so far.</p>
<p>Make your comment on the original post - you won’t be able to on this one.</p>
<p>And don’t let the fact that you have already commented put you off having another go!</p></div>
