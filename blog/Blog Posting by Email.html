<h1>Blog Posting by Email</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2007-03-12 14:31</div>
<div class="content"><p>Squarespace has just introduced a new facility by which I can make blog postings by e-mail. This is my first attempt - if you can read it, then it’s worked. </p><p>I’m wondering though if blogging by e-mail has a different dynamic. I know that when I write e-mails to people I tend to write in a different style to how I write when I’m writing an article. Will blogging by e-mail result in much difference to what I put on the blog? I wonder.</p></div>

There's a wiki there and really could use helpers to help me out. I hope you guys can register as my goal is for this website to be one of the best SC2 sites on the net. Please register asap as there will be a tournament. If you have any suggestions please feel free to let me know!<br><br>Thx. Great forum btw!</div>
