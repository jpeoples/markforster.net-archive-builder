<h1>Competition Report - 1</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted: 2011-03-19 9:12</div>
<div class="content"><p>The <a href="../blog/Time for another Competition.html">current competition</a> question is:</p>
<p><em>“In SuperFocus, how would you handle the project of writing an historical novel and getting it published?”</em></p>
<p><em>Assume you are already established as an historical novelist.</em></p>
<p>This competition is off to a bit of a slow start with only three attempts to answer the question so far, and only one of those has made any serious attempt to analyse what would be involved.</p>
<p>Just to clear up any confusion, the question is about how to handle a large, multifaceted, personal project in SuperFocus. The historical novel is just an example - a case study.</p>
<p>There’s plenty of scope for further answers. After all the pages and pages of discussion about project handling on the Discussion Forum, I’m sure there are many better answers to come.</p>
<p>Answers on the original post please. You can’t post them here.</p></div>
