<div class="content"><p>I've posted a series of old articles under the <a href="/time-management-articles/">Time Management Articles </a>tab, and I might add more to them. But basically it is my intention that new articles I write should go in the blog, which means they can be categorised in the blog archive.</p><p>I've been messing around with the colour scheme too, using the templates on <a href="http://www.squarespace.com/" target="_blank">SquareSpace</a>. Since this site will be mainly text based it's important that it's legibility is high, and the original template I tried wasn't very. </p></div>
