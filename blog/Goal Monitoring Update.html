<div class="content"><p>I can’t say that my scheme for increasing my <a href="/display/ShowJournal?moduleId=817806&currentPage=3&categoryId=92107">advertisement income </a>has worked very well. I ended the month with a daily average of $3.44, which was well below my target. On the other hand for the first two days of this month, the average was $7.12, which just goes to show how much the figures vary - especially as the record for one day’s advertising revenue was obtained on a day when I hadn’t made a blog entry for a week.</p><p>I’m going to have to go back to the drawing board on this.</p><p>On the other hand <a href="/blog/2006/12/4/can-i-improve-on-the-no-s-diet.html">my diet </a>continues to work very well. I’m bang on target today, which means I have lost 9 lbs. It’s beginning to be noticeable!</p></div>
