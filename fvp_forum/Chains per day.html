<div class="content">How many chains do you get through on average per day.<br><br>I do about between 1-2 a day, sometimes only 1/2 a chain.  Mark mentioned that you should do 3 or more.<br><br>My problem is that once I hit momentum with a task then I think it is a bad idea to move on.  I feel you will lose some momentum and/or creativity relating to the task by not being able to go "deep".<br><br>It is like telling Leonardo da Vinci to stop painting Mona Lisa, because you need to finish you chains?<br><br>What do you think?<br><br>(Ultimately, the search for an ideal system is to be able to get your tasks done, but also to create.  Creating I feel is the ultimate satisfaction.)</div>

<div class="content">Nico, I think the question is whether your "hitting momentum" is productive for you, or not. If yes, why to change it? If not, you can apply many methods - time boxing, pomodoro, project blocks (schedule activities where you need momentum), little-and-often approach etc. As somebody suggested in previous discussions, little-and-often is skill which can be learnt and practiced, even if you considered it unrealistic before. The same skill is quitting task (when you know you gained momentum and you would like to continue) and doing something else. It can also be learnt and practiced easily then. <br><br>The question is only whether to apply this skill, or whether to use momentum and work further. From my experience - it differs with every situation and every task. When you quit early (and use little-and-often), you will quite often find out that you are more effective, because many ideas, new views, changes in opinions etc. will occur to you in the meantime, when you are doing other activities. Unconscious processing, resting the mind, approaching to the task from other perspective/mood/context, which changed in between - it all can be of benefit for creativity and effectivity when using little-and-often approach. But sometimes, nothing is better than to go deep and work on a task for several hours... so, I sometimes experiment and let my previous experience drive me.</div>

<div class="content">I think it was Hemingway who ended each day's writing with half a sentence, so it was easier to pick up the next day.<br><br>My too-long sessions are usually things I enjoy (video games) or things I would enjoy if I managed little-and-often (gardening and accounting). I realized that on the first draft of this post -- the pattern is I do, or could, enjoy them. I rarely go too long with housework.<br><br>I find if I work too long at a sitting, it's hard to start again. The blisters are still raw. It's the same if I don't work often enough. The problem, though, is the solution leans toward 5 minutes a day on a gazillion tasks rather than getting any of them finished.</div>

<div class="content">It sounds like you don't feel that 5 minutes per day on a gazillion tasks is efficient.  For others that might be the sweet spot.  As Daneb points out, there are different techniques that work better than others for a particular task.<br><br>In theory, you should eventually start finishing some.  Then when you have only half a gazillion, you will be able to spend 10 minutes a day on them and wrap them up faster and/or more efficiently. <br><br>Maybe keeping something like this in mind when you make your chains you will "want" to do things in an order that lets you finish more.</div>

<div class="content">Good point, MarytH. Every time I use up a box of dental floss, I think, "That could have been a project." 100 yards gone, one flossing at a time.</div>
