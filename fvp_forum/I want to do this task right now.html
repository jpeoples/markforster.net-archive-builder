<div class="content">When I start a new preselection, sometimes it happens that I read the top task and feel like I want to do it straitght away. In AF terms, it "stands out"/"feels ready to be done".<br><br>In that case, is the FV best practice still to scan the list to see if anything may come up that I want to do before this task (even though I'm convinced there won't be), or can I trust my intuition and use this drive to just get the task out of the way? Are there any downsides to not scanning the full list here?</div>

<div class="content">Lots of times I want to do the top task straightaway. Occasionally, I have done it mindlessly. No harm was done, but it is not the way I like to operate.<br><br>It takes me less than a minute to quickly scan the entire list. I feel that it is always worth that small investment in time to make sure I am not missing something.<br><br>Of course, by taking less than a minute, I am not carefully looking at each open item. I am just running my eyes quickly through the list.<br><br>I think that the more times I scan the list the better. It keeps me more conscious of the important and/or urgent items that are still open.</div>

<div class="content">I personally prefer to scan the rest of the list anyway. There's always that small chance that you've added something important to the list recently. Even if I think I know there's nothing to be done before the current task, I'd prefer to develop the habit of checking anyway. It only takes a minute or two...</div>
