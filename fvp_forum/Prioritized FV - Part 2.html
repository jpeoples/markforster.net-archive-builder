It was called to my attention thereafter that the task probably wasn't REALLY urgent but only faux-urgent because I had allowed it to age to the point where I was getting hassled about it -- and I agreed.

I revived a thread that had been little-noticed and probably long-forgotten, so it was easily mistaken for a new thread.<br><br><< But apart from that you appear to be misunderstanding the question in FV. >><br><br>I don't believe that I am misunderstanding the question, but I have to concede the possibility.<br><br><< You picked a task as a test case and were then careful not to influence the result.

However, I did not want to influence the result as a result of observing it.  (Schrödinger's cat comes to mind here.)  I used this test case as an indicator, that's all.  I wanted to understand how FV handles the list as a whole.<br><br><< You seem to be still treating it as if you have to WANT to do the task in itself, rather than want to do it BEFORE something else. The very fact that you've stuck priority stars in front of it shows you want to do it BEFORE other tasks. >><br><br>I wanted it DONE before other tasks, I didn't want to DO it before other tasks.  That's the difference.  It's like wanting to be at your ideal weight, but not wanting to diet to get there.</div>

<div class="content">Lillian:<br><br><< in both chains, the FV question order has item 10 worked on first since the last item of the chain is worked first. The Prioritized FV order has item 10 worked last since 8, 6, and 5 in the first choice, 9 and 4 in the 2nd choice, need to be worked on before getting to 10. >><br><br>It's not that simple.  Because the focus of The Question is what you want to do BEFORE the reference task, changing the order of the list (as Prioritized FV does) will change the results of the preselection process.  If standard FV selects 10 as the last task in the chain, it's because you want to do it BEFORE all those other tasks in that chain.  Therefore, when it becomes the root of the chain, you would NOT end up selecting the same tasks, because you wanted to do them AFTER task 10.</div>

<div class="content">Deven, You're not interpreting the question the way Mark intended. If you want A _done before_ B, then you should do it before B -- assuming there's no good reason (such as deadline or resources) that B should be done first.<br><br>Having said that, I still prefer prioritized when busy. I think it's because my big list includes what others call someday/maybe items. I'm not ready to dismiss them. Using FV lets me keep them on the list and deal with them (often deferring them) one a time -- one every chain. That works better for me than the line "review someday/maybe list".<br><br>After week of the original FV, my high-priority tasks weren't progressing. They were always listed after an even higher priority, so never chosen. <br><br>1* 2* 3* 4* 5* 10 9 8 7 6<br>10* 9 8 7 6<br>9* 8 7 6<br>8* 7 6<br>7* 6<br>7<br><br>Yes, 10 got attention first, but then 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 all got attention before 9.<br><br>I'd begin each day without a feel for how much I had to accomplish each day. Each chain was an equal mix of high (end-chain) and low (early in the chain) priority projects -- even when there were enough high-priority ones to fill the day.<br><br>The downside of the prioritized method is that when I finish my top priorities for the day, I feel like I'm done for the day.<br><br>I feel almost ready to go back to straight FV, but with the option to pull out the priorities and focus on them when I feel it necessary. Another option might be when I finish half the chain, rebuild it from the middle -- but only once per chain. That way the 2nd half (higher priority) would get twice the attention. Hard to say if that's more of an adjustment than prioritizing them.</div>

<div class="content">Also, there's no reason why I can't just dot the first task on my list and then immediately dot my two most urgent tasks passing over everything in between. And if the two most urgent tasks are out of order, I would simply cross out the most urgent task, re-write it at the end of my list, and dot and do. <br><br>Once I reach the last task in my ladder, my oldest task, I could do a little work on it and start a new ladder in the same manner as before, or I could decide that my two most urgent tasks have once again become urgent. In that case, I would simply dot them both and do some more work on them.</div>

Yes, you'll work it last in that chain, since you work the chain in reverse, but it will be included.  That matters if it's a high-resistance task.  If it's a low-resistance task, you're less likely to select anything else to be done before it, in which case the chain is likely to be shorter, and the root task might be the only task in the chain, in which case you'd work on it first.  This would likely be the case if you know it to be urgent and you want it done right away.</div>

Lillian is correct. Any task on the list at any time can be crossed out, re-written at the end, dotted, and begun now or next as an urgent prioritized task. That is the "magic slot" — the end of your list.</div>

That "magic slot" is the FIRST item in the list, because it is automatically selected as the root task in the chain.  It is the ONLY task in the list that is ever preselected automatically, regardless of what you want to do before what.  Tasks you want to do are likely to be selected anyway, but the magic of that first slot is that you are more likely to make progress on things you've been neglecting or avoiding.  It helps drive old tasks to completion, but it may do so at the expense of higher priorities.  That's what Prioritized FV is designed to fix.</div>

That may be just my world view where Urgent = 'drop everything & do now'.  Anything else is high priority. <br><br>(unless it's a quick 'can be done in 2 minutes, so just do it now' type task, but I think of those tasks more as unavoidable interruptions rather than urgent tasks.

<div class="content">Deven:<br><br><br>"Yes, the FV rules do allow urgent tasks to be added/rewritten at the end of the list and immediately dotted to work on them."<br><br>... Immediately dotted yes, but not necessarily immediately worked on.<br><br><br><br>"However, this is just a way to keep within the system when working on urgent tasks that you want to drop everything and do immediately."<br><br>...Wrong. If you want to drop everything and do a task immediately, you do just that and ignore your list.<br><br><br><br>"If the FV rules didn't include this suggestion, everyone would use the "common-sense rule" and just set the FV list aside while dealing with the urgent task(s) immediately and then resume processing the list."<br><br>... Absolutely correct! That's *exactly* what should be done for "drop everything and do" urgent tasks. But we are not discussing those.<br> <br><br><br>"Notice that the effect is the same -- you drop everything and work on the urgent task, then resume where you left off."<br><br>... Wrong. You don't drop everything and work on the urgent task. You cross it out, re-write it at the end of the list, dot it, and continue working on your current task and work on the newly dotted task next. You also have the *choice* of immediately stopping work on your current task and starting work on your more urgent task. Why? Because it's not a "drop everything and do" task. If any task is a "drop everything and do now" task it is a completely different level of urgent task than what is handled with FV. Notice that the effect is completely different.<br><br><br><br>"Basically, using this FV rule allows you to pretend that you're working on the urgent task because it's the next task to be worked in the chain..."<br><br>... Personally I never pretend I'm working on an urgent task. Seems kind of a silly notion. If it's next in the chain, I actually work on it.<br><br><br><br>"...but the reality is that this is just a way to do what you're going to do regardless (work on the urgent task immediately)..."<br><br>... Right and wrong. Right, in that the reality is this is a way to do what I'm going to do. And wrong, because the rules don't specify you must work on the urgent task immediately, dropping everything. That's the highest level of urgency and is not handled by FV. There are many levels of urgency. With regard to FV, urgency is the importance of a task translated into a time scale. And that time scale gets translated into a balanced sequence of easy and difficult tasks.<br><br>If a task becomes the most urgent task while working your current chain, or becomes the next most urgent task while working your chain, or becomes the most urgent task after you add an additional pre-selection when building your chain, it should be crossed out, re-written at the end, and dotted. One should then wrap up what you're working on and begin that task next if you're working a current chain. <br><br>FV is helping you *sequence* your tasks in a balanced manner. But it's no emergency. If that's the case, the level of urgency has outgrown FV and should be handled swiftly by dropping everything and attending to the urgent task. Then return to your list once the urgent matter has been handled.<br><br><br>"This FV rule is a nod to reality that when you want to drop everything to work on an urgent task immediately, you can and will do so."<br><br>... Wrong. That's for emergencies and those are never handled by FV. So if your refer to any rule within FV, it is never referring to "drop everything and do" emergency-level urgent tasks.<br><br><br><br>"Note that when something "urgent" comes in that you DON'T want to drop everything to do immediately, you'll just add it to your list and choose NOT to invoke this rule."<br><br>... Completely wrong. I note that when something "urgent" comes in that I don't want to drop everything to do immediately and instead add to my list at the end, it gets a dot and is started next. So that rule is indeed invoked.<br><br><br><br>"Really, whether you drop everything to work on the urgent task depends on whether you WANT to drop everything to work on it or not, and that FV rule doesn't actually change the outcome here."<br><br>... Wrong. Whether I drop everything to work on the urgent task depends on whether it's an emergency-level "drop everything and do" urgent task. By it's very nature, a task like that does not offer you a choice but rather a dilemma: act or suffer the consequences of not acting.<br><br><br><br>"The end of the list is NOT the "magic slot" that Cricket and I have referred to. That "magic slot" is the FIRST item in the list..."<br><br>... I was pointing out that everything you want out of that "magical" place can be found at the end of your list using FV.<br> <br><br><br>"...the magic of that first slot is that you are more likely to make progress on things you've been neglecting or avoiding."<br><br>... Mark's Alternative FV does exactly what you describe here.<br><br><br><br>"It helps drive old tasks to completion [Deven is referring to the "magic slot" using standard FV — M.B.], but it may do so at the expense of higher priorities."<br><br>... Right and wrong. Right, in that the first task on your list, the oldest, is driven to completion using FV. Wrong, in that it may do so at the expense of higher priorities. If something is a higher priority it will be pre-selected after your first task, be done before your first task, and be re-written at the end of your list before your first pre-selected task is even started. <br><br>Then, when you pre-select your next chain, the first task on your list is selected followed by whatever tasks you pre-select in the middle of your list, or not, followed by your highest-priority tasks that were re-written at the end of your list. Your highest-priorities are now ready to be worked on first, once again, before any other lesser-priority tasks.<br><br>The magic you seek is in FV already.

<div class="content">Lillian:<br><br><br>"...if it's not a 'drop everything & do now' task, is it really an urgent task?"<br><br>... It could be. If the task must be started soon then it's urgent. If it must be started next or now it's even more urgent. Soon, next, or now are all urgent tasks whose level of urgency will vary depending on factors like: the time of day, day of the week, or the date the task must be started.

<div class="content">Lillian,<br><br>Yes, FV has the option to rebuild the chain, either from the current last dot or the entire thing, any time the old chain is no longer valid. That feels like a slippery slope, ending with "Whenever I reach a task I don't want to do, erase all dots and start over." You'd never get more than half-way up the chain!<br><br>I'd forgotten we can move something to the end if it's important. I don't know how that would work in the long-run. Early on, there would be a lot of copying. You'd still get high-priority items in the shadow of higher-priority items, but not as often.<br><br>FV didn't handle my priority jobs for me. After a week or two they needed urgent attention. They were always in the shadow of higher-priority jobs. My previously-neglected maintenance jobs had good progress, but not the deadline tasks.<br><br>Michael,<br><br>When I refer to the magic slot, I mean the one that gets the first dot -- the one closest to the top of the page. In Prioritized FV, it's the oldest high priority one. The most-recent line only gets attention if it's more important than any other line in the list. That line has a magic of its own, though -- it's never in the shadow of another line.<br><br>++++<br><br>I think rewriting high-priority tasks at the end is worth trying.<br><br>I'll try regular FV for a week or so. However, I'm going to start each day by making a list of priorities. That list might even be written at the end of the FV list. The daily review of high-priority tasks will be the safety-net.<br><br>I'm still worried that as I near the end of a chain, I'll spend too much time on low-priority jobs. We'll see how it goes.</div>

You'd never get more than half-way up the chain!<<<br><br>Not that I've noticed. The 'don't want' task is half-way through your list. There's 3 possibilities (or more, but these are the 3 I've done)<br><br>1 -  It's the last dot of the chain (because it's next item to work on), and you decide to erase all dots and start over. The root task is the same. You could re-dot the same items (except for that "don't want to do" task) and a few more down the list. (1a - Or you end up dotting all different items.) Then you work up the new chain and finish/work on everything. You have a new root task for the next chain. <br><br>2 - Or you get to that "don't want" task and come up with a valid (or barely valid :) ) reason that it can't be worked on right now, cross it off and move it to the end of the list and continue your way up the chain. <br><br>3 - Or you get to that "don't want" task and decide to extend the chain. You work your way back up to the "don't want" task and this time it doesn't seem so bad so you do 5 minutes on it, cross it off and re-write at the end of the list (little & often), and continue your way up the chain. <br><br>As I understand FV, all 3 of these are following the "letter of the law" or at least, the "spirit of the law"</div>

How can you say that's not at the expense of higher priorities?<br><br>With Prioritized FV, the root task may still be something that you wouldn't otherwise be working on, but at least it's the oldest task AT THE HIGHEST PRIORITY LEVEL which is being driven to completion, not some random low-priority task that just happens to be the oldest on the list.  That matters.<br><br><<  If something is a higher priority it will be pre-selected after your first task, be done before your first task, and be re-written at the end of your list before your first pre-selected task is even started. >><br><br>Just because a task is higher priority than the root task doesn't automatically mean that you'll want to do it before that task.

That leaves more time to spend on the high-priority tasks, completing them sooner.  Standard FV leads to longer chains with more lower-priority tasks.<br><br>If you DON'T want to be working on your highest priorities, standard FV probably won't select them, and even if you do, you don't get the laddering effect for items at the end of the list.

<div class="content">I posted the following on one of the previous sections of this discussion<br><a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/fv-forum/post/1806263#post1807417" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/fv-forum/post/1806263#post1807417</a><br><br>I don't believe it ever received a response from Deven, so I am reposting it here.<br><br>==========<br>Normal FV tends to concentrate the really active and important and urgent stuff toward the end of the list. Starred FV does the opposite, concentrating all those things towards the beginning of the list. It seems to replace FV's normal mechanisms for dealing with urgency and importance with something entirely new. I would imagine that everything in the middle of the list would get neglected, or would simply be fuel for procrastination while you work your way through your preselection back to the urgent stuff with the stars. (BTW, you've also given yourself another way to procrastinate with the rule that adding or removing a star counts as "taking action".)<br><br>FV is the opposite. When I start a new chain, the #1 item is usually something like this:<br>- It's stale and should be deleted, and it's taken me a long time to realize this fact<br>- It's a back-burner, long-term project that just needs me to occasionally stir the pot<br>- It's some fun thing that I'd like to do but have never had time<br>- It's some nasty knot that I need to untie and wish it would go away - leaving it as a knot won't cause any disasters but I really don't feel I can delete it<br><br>Truly urgent things never make it to this spot. By the time an "urgent" task percolates through my list, it has either become clear that it was never really urgent or important, and was OK to delete or let sit. Or it became clear that it really was urgent, and needed urgent attention, and *received* it.<br><br>Generally different sections of my list have a different character. For example:<br>1. First there's a bunch of old stuff that still attracts my attention for some reason.<br>2. Then a long string of back-burner, long-term "nice to do" work projects.<br>3. Then a long string of odds and ends that need doing out in the yard.<br>4. Then more "nice to do" work stuff, maybe a little more urgent than the previous string.<br>5. Then finally I get to a good long string of 100-200 tasks of miscellaneous emails, random thoughts, requests from coworkers, my wife, or my children, action items from recent meetings -- all from the last few days or week.<br>6. Last of all are the recently re-entered hot projects, urgent tasks, and really new fresh items.<br><br>I've cycled through this list dozens of times, and have a pretty good feel for each "neighborhood" of tasks and what kinds of things are lurking there. I am afraid that if I put a "star" next to anything that seems important, it would completely upset the order of the list. I already know where most of the really important stuff is -- it's down in the last third of the list. If circumstances change and some older item suddenly becomes important, I also have a pretty good idea where to find those items. (And if I can't remember, OneNote has great search capabilities).<br><br>For each chain of tasks, I always feel that I am working on the most urgent and most important things FIRST, even if I am just taking small, "little and often" actions. They do get the most attention. As I work my way up the chain, I finally get to some older tasks. And then things get really interesting. Since I have just spent the last 1-2 hours working through urgent and important tasks, and am thinking about them, trying to balance them, etc., many of these older tasks really stand out in how irrelevant they are, when compared to what is REALLY active and important in my life. I end up deleting a whole bunch of them. Maybe a few stand out as fun or interesting or useful back-burner kinds of things -- a nice break from the whirlwind rush of all the really critical things. The key is that FV focuses my mind and attention on what really matters. It helps drive results on the things that really matter. And it forces everything else to be considered in that context.<br><br>The star approach completely changes all these dynamics, as far as I can tell  (effectively giving you a completely different system as soon as you introduce any stars).<br><br>Again, if you think I'm mistaken, let me know.</div>

<div class="content">After actioning the current task while working an FV chain one has a choice:<br><br>1  begin working on the next dotted task in the chain or<br>2  ask the question "what do I want to do before x?" (where x is choice 1)<br><br>Both alternatives fall within the rules of FV.<br><br>"Chain Completion Mode"- Choice 1 is perhaps viewed as the normal way of proceeding  <br>and emphasizes chain completion including "root tasks".  Workflow:  Just build a  <br>chain and complete it.  Repeat.<br><br>"Priority Mode"- Choice 2 is often invoked when time has passed and conditions have  <br>changed.  In this situation there have likely been more tasks added to the list  <br>since your pre-selection that may now be considered more urgent or higher priority  <br>than the task in choice 1.  The chain is then extended by dotting one or more  <br>additional tasks.  Workflow:  Build a chain and extend it when urgencies arise.  <br>Alternate between working and extending the chain as needed.  Eventually complete  <br>the chain when urgencies subside.<br><br>Choice 2 can also be made routinely after actioning each and every task.  There will  <br>often be one or more tasks farther down the list that you want to do before x now  <br>that you have actioned the current task.  If so you may choose to extend the chain.   <br>Workflow:  Build a chain, complete a task, scan the list from the completed task to  <br>the end of the list looking for tasks you want to do before x and dot those tasks.  Eventually complete  the chain.  (You may recognize this as "the extended Colley's Rule".)<br><br>There are pros and cons to both choices:<br><br>Choice 1 when used consistently results in a more compact list as root tasks are  <br>actioned by completing shorter chains more frequently.  It offers a sense of  <br>accomplishment after each completed chain.  The down side is that you will be  <br>actioning some lower priority tasks before some higher priority tasks.  This  <br>perceived shortcoming has been illustrated by Cricket and Deven and Deven has  <br>advocated "Prioritized FV" as a solution.<br><br>Choice 2 results in actioning your complete list in precise order of priority based  <br>on "what do I want to do before x?" No matter where a task is on your list if it is  <br>the task you want to do before all others choice 2 will find it.  By using choice 2  <br>you do not have to worry about overlooking a very urgent task as you would when you're locked  <br>in to the "chain completion mode" of choice 1.  The down side of choice 2 is that it  <br>can result in an extended FV list over many pages.  You will not action the root task  <br>until it is the task on the list that you want to do before all others.  Michael B.  <br>has illustrated various ways of invoking Choice 2 and argues that it mitigates any  <br>need for tweaking FV as in Deven's "Prioritized FV".<br><br>These two modes of working an FV list will appeal to different people and the same  <br>person on different occasions.  I tend to use Chain Completion Mode (Choice 1) as a  <br>consolidation strategy when the list is spread out over too many pages and I'm  <br>getting lost in the woods.  I use Priority Mode (Choice 2 - not to be confused with  <br>Prioritized FV) when I have lots of incoming urgent tasks and when I need to ensure  <br>that I'm doing the task I want to do before all others at any given time.  [Seraphim  <br>has just posted a commentary on how he uses Priority Mode in staying on top of heavy  <br>incoming task volume.]<br><br>I want to emphasize once more that although Chain Completion Mode is considered the  <br>standard FV methodology, Priority Mode is not a tweak or an alternative version.   <br>The FV algorithm and rule set is very simple but it is also very flexible and  <br>powerful in allowing multiple choices and modes of approach.<br><br>Lastly a head to head comparison using the priority sequence illustrated by Cricket  <br>earlier in this thread:<br><br>"Normal FV" (what I call Chain Completion Mode) results in-<br>10 8 6 5 / 9 4 / 7 3 / 5 2 / 1<br><br>Using Deven's "prioritized FV" results in-<br>10 / 9 / 8 6 5 / 7 4 / 5 / 3 / 2 / 1<br><br>To this I add:<br>Using FV in what I call Priority Mode results in-<br>10 / 9 8 / 7 6 5 / 5 4 / 3 / 2 / 1<br><br>Pick your poison but get everything done!</div>

<div class="content">Lillian:<br><br><< Those low-priority items are on the list whether you're using FV or Prioritized FV, right? >><br><br>Yes, of course.<br><br><< So, in either case, sooner or later, they're either going to get dotted and worked on, (probably sooner with FV since they'll eventually show up as a root task), moved to a tickler file to show up on a future date, dismissed, or handled with some other "I'm not doing it now" tactic. Either way, they have to be dealt with at some point, right? >><br><br>Yes, but Prioritized FV won't force them onto the chains as root tasks until all the prioritized tasks are completed.  Standard FV will do it regardless.  Either will allow you to work on the low-priority tasks if that's what you want to do before the benchmark task.<br><br><< >>high-priority tasks will cycle through the "magic slot" more frequently to become root tasks.<<<br><br>I guess I have a mental block on this because a high-priority task (at least how I define it) no matter where it is on the list, could be on most/all chains anyway. And if it's high-priority enough, it's off the list and worked on as non-discretionary (and therefore non-FV) time. >><br><br>That works fine if you have one or three high-priority tasks that you want to be working on that are always on your mind.  On the other hand, if you have dozens of higher-priority tasks that you can't focus on in the same way, and dozens more low-priority tasks that can definitely wait, then Prioritized FV will help you focus more on the higher-priority tasks first.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br><< One significant advantage of FV over P-FV is the way it handles the situation I describe here:<br><a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/fv-forum/post/1828991#post1830218" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/fv-forum/post/1828991#post1830218</a><br><br>If I were following P-FV, I would not have worked on my high priority tasks at all during the last week, because I never worked my way to the first items in the chain.<br><br>FV ensured that they were kept going, in an appropriate balance with all the new and high-urgency work that was being piled on me. >><br><br>I disagree; this appears to be a case where standard FV failed you, so you had to go into an alternate processing mode of doing "partial reset" all the time and firefighting with the urgent tasks dotted at the end of your list, while completely ignoring the start of the list and the start of your chain that you extended for 2 weeks.  I don't recall Mark discussing a "partial reset" but it does sound logical.  Nevertheless, I doubt he intended for one chain to be repeatedly extended for weeks...<br><br>I would argue that you were should have been completing chains instead of spending two weeks on the same chain.  Mark recommended at least 3 chains per day -- I haven't managed that many, but I know I've done better when I complete at least one chain every day instead of allowing a chain to span multiple days.  However, if you did that with standard FV, it would have pulled your attention away from the high-priority tasks you were working on, in order to work on lower-priority tasks that happened to be the oldest on your list.<br><br>With Prioritized FV, when you went into firefighting mode, you could have simply put all those urgent top-priority tasks on the top of your list as the highest priority (adding a new higher priority level than anything else on your list), and worked the chains as usual, with chains that consisted probably entirely of high-priority tasks.  That way, you could follow the system and be actually finishing chains and keeping on track while still focusing all your time and energy on high-priority tasks as you did anyway.<br><br>I wouldn't really call this an advantage of FV over Prioritized FV, given that you were repeatedly extending the same chain for 2 weeks instead of working the chains normally.  If standard FV was so well-suited for such urgent firefighting situations, why did you have to change the processing algorithm so drastically?</div>

I've been trying to space out my replies more to get other work done and to let other people get a word in edgewise. :)<br><br><< Also, I think Mark hit it right on the spot with his description -- I think that's exactly why I was feeling dizzy, when contemplating using your rules, but I just couldn't put my finger on it.<br><br>Normal FV tends to concentrate the really active and important and urgent stuff toward the end of the list. Starred FV does the opposite, concentrating all those things towards the beginning of the list. >><br><br>That it does, but why does that strike you as a problem?  The reason it puts the high-priority stuff at the top of the list is to ensure the root task of every chain is always a highest-priority task instead of the oldest task.  The purpose is to remain focused on high-priority tasks as much as possible, rather than being pulled away from high-priority tasks to work on lower-priority tasks.<br><br><< It seems to replace FV's normal mechanisms for dealing with urgency and importance with something entirely new. I would imagine that everything in the middle of the list would get neglected, or would simply be fuel for procrastination while you work your way through your preselection back to the urgent stuff with the stars. >><br><br>Yes, with Prioritized FV, the low-priority tasks will be more easily neglected in favor of the high-priority tasks, but that's a good thing.  However, they're not automatically neglected -- any task could still be your answer to The Question, so if there's a low-priority task you want to do before a high-priority task, there's nothing to prevent you from selecting it.  However, chains tend to be shorter and composed mostly of high-priority tasks (unless you're procrastinating on the high-priority tasks), because you're less likely to want to do any given low-priority task before any given high-priority task.<br><br>On the other hand, if you have a high-resistance high-priority task that you ARE procrastinating on, that's where Prioritized FV really shines, because it not only forces you to work more on the task you're avoiding (by cycling it through the "magic slot" at the top of the list more frequently to become the root task) AND it allows you to select one or more lower-priority tasks that you want to do before it, to provide that laddering effect to work your way up to working the task you're avoiding.  If urgent tasks are at the end of the list, you can still select them, but you can't get the laddering effect when there's nothing later in the list to select!<br><br><< (BTW, you've also given yourself another way to procrastinate with the rule that adding or removing a star counts as "taking action".) >><br><br>For the system to work, tasks cannot be left in the wrong place in the list.  The point is to keep the list in order by priority groups, from highest to lowest.  The purpose of this rule is to allow you to rewrite any task at any time when you change the number of stars, while also allowing you to select a task, change the number of stars at that time, and wait until after actioning the task (while working the chain) to rewrite it.<br><br>If you're so determined to procrastinate on a task that you'll just keep changing the number of stars and call that "actioning" the task, you know you're playing games with yourself, and you would just as easily find some other excuse to decide you can't work on it when it comes up and rewrite it anyway.  At least with Prioritized FV, if you do this repeatedly with a high-priority task, it will throw it back at you over and over again instead of letting you bury it at the bottom of the list and forget about it for many chains.<br><br><< FV is the opposite. When I start a new chain, the #1 item is usually something like this:<br>- It's stale and should be deleted, and it's taken me a long time to realize this fact<br>- It's a back-burner, long-term project that just needs me to occasionally stir the pot<br>- It's some fun thing that I'd like to do but have never had time<br>- It's some nasty knot that I need to untie and wish it would go away - leaving it as a knot won't cause any disasters but I really don't feel I can delete it >><br><br>Yes, and this is why standard FV pulls your attention from high-priority tasks to deal with things like this.  Prioritized FV is designed to pull your attention TO the high-priority tasks until they're dealt with, THEN focus on the old low-priority stuff.  Remember, when there are no longer any prioritized tasks, and all remaining tasks are low-priority (or normal-priority, if you prefer to view unstarred tasks as such), then Prioritized FV behaves identically to standard FV.  It only behaves differently when there are starred tasks in the list.<br><br><< Truly urgent things never make it to this spot.

(It sounds like your "neighborhoods" are already representing several priority levels.)  With Prioritized FV, I'd suggest having one star (maybe even two!) be "normal" priority that's the default one you use for everyday tasks, and have unstarred tasks be of the "maybe someday" sort.  The "neighborhoods" might end up reversed on your list (with highest-priority stuff at the top of the list instead of at the end), but the FV algorithm will then focus more attention on the high-priority stuff instead of old low-priority stuff.<br><br><< For each chain of tasks, I always feel that I am working on the most urgent and most important things FIRST, even if I am just taking small, "little and often" actions.

Instead of being required by the FV algorithm to put aside high-priority tasks to work on a low-priority root task, you can choose when you want to take a break from the whirlwind rush and work on the lower-priority tasks.  That puts you in control of when to focus on lower priorities instead of being arbitrarily told to focus on a low priority when you'd rather be working on a high priority.<br><br>As for deleting tasks that are no longer relevant, you can always do that during the preselection process while building your chains.<br><br>If you use Prioritized FV, you'll probably have shorter chains consisting mostly of higher-priority tasks most of the time, and work more chains as a result.  But whenever you want a break from that type of work, you can choose to select low-priority tasks to do before the high-priority root task.  Prioritized FV will focus more attention on high-priority tasks, but not lock you into doing those exclusively.</div>

The FV instructions are quite clear: "Once you have taken action on all the preselected tasks, preselect another chain of tasks starting again from the first unactioned task on the list."

<div class="content">Deven wrote:<br><< Yes, and this is why standard FV pulls your attention from high-priority tasks to deal with things like this. >><br><br>Deven, you repeat this idea in several different ways in your post:  the idea that FV draws your attention mostly to the root items.  I think you really haven't got a feel for how FV works.  Standard FV does NOT focus your attention on the root item, the first item in the list.  It draws one's attention to the END of the list.  <br><br>The way it works for me, the things down near the end of the list that receive dots are the things that are high importance and/or high urgency.   They receive most of the attention.  As I move through them, moving up the chain, taking action as needed, it moves faster and faster till I then arrive at the other, less pressing things closer to the top of the list.  Often those things get DELETED because, having just focused my time and attention on truly important things, I clearly see that they are really not that important and I don't want to be committed to them.   <br><br>Sometimes I end up deleting the root item itself, for the same reason.

They get deleted, or get some small action that helps break the ice.<br><br>The idea of the root item in FV is not to draw your attention there, but to get you to make a decision about items that have been sitting in your list for a long time WITHOUT a decision.  By the time it's reached the root position, you've had plenty of time to sift that item, little and often, consciously and unconsciously.</div>

I still think you'd likely be better off working multiple chains under Prioritized FV instead of extending a single chain for weeks on end, but I agree for highly-urgent firefighting, the latter FV rule is sufficient.  Prioritized FV is better at handling less-urgent priority items, especially high-resistance ones.</div>

<div class="content">Ditto to Lillian.   When things are moving very quickly, my list becomes irrelevant very quickly, as in, several times per day.   When I have more discretionary time, like today, my list remains relevant for a good long chunk of time, and I can just keep working through the chain.   <br><br>The beauty of FV is it handles both situations beautifully.</div>

<div class="content">Lillian:<br><br><< Deven ->>Routinely returning to preselection after actioning every task in the chain isn't following FV<<<br><br>The FV rules say "If you find that your preselected list is no longer relevant (e.g. if you have had a long break away from the list), then scrap the preselection and reselect from the beginning. A shorter way to do this is to reselect only from the last preselected task which you haven't done yet." >><br><br>Yes, and I quoted that too.  That's not what Mike D is advocating.<br><br><< I don't treat "a long break away from the list" as the only reason a preselect list (chain) is no longer relevant. If my chain is only left with low-prority items (because the high-priority items are in "wait for something from someone else" mode or oherwise undotted) and my boss gives me a bunch of new items that are higher priority, then for me, the chain is no longer relevant and I start over with creating a new chain. (which I consider to be Mike D's option 2) >><br><br>The situation you describe, with your boss dumping a bunch of new priorities on you, I would agree falls within the FV rule where "your preselected list is no longer relevant" -- being away from the list for a long time was an example, and I would consider this situation another reasonable example.<br><br><< What's the definition of "otherwise become irrelevant" ? >><br><br>It's situation-dependent, obviously.  Your example is a good one.<br><br>Mike D's approach, on the other hand, isn't to scrap the preselection when it becomes irrelevant.  It's to routinely consider adding to the chain AFTER ACTIONING EVERY TASK.  That's enormously different, and not at all what that rule was contemplating.<br><br>Mark, am I wrong about this?</div>

They say "when your preselected list is no longer relevant".   When several major priorities are in the midst of thrash, my priorities can change several times during the course of a day.  It happens sometimes.  FV handles it very well, and this rule works.   When the thrashing stops, this rule doesn't need to be applied, and I can return to simply working through my chain.  FV works perfectly fine in both situations.<br><br>Whether a reset should be done every morning or not depends on whether your situation changes substantially overnight.  The only way I know for sure is to check my emails, check my voicemails, check my meetings for the day, etc.   So, the first task I do every day is my "reset":  check emails, check voicemails, check calendar, check tickler, add those new tasks to my list.   Then I just start working my list as dotted from yesterday.  If I find my mind being drawn to all the new stuff I just added, instead of focusing on my chain, then I do the reset.<br><br>For other people who don't have so much new incoming stuff all the time, maybe a morning reset isn't needed at all.   They can just keep working through their existing chain.<br><br>FV handles both situations perfectly.</div>

<div class="content">I agree that the chain should not be reset after every task, as a general rule.   I don't think Mike D's summary of the rules is an accurate summary of the general rules.<br><br>Perhaps Mike D deals with tasks in such a way that after working on any given task, his situation DOES change and he needs to re-evaluate and see where things are at.   So, he can do a reset after every task, because he feels the need to double-check the relevance of his current chain.  That's simply a special case that is already covered in Mark's standard FV rules.   <br><br>Everyone will have his or her own rhythm of how often to do a reset, or a partial reset, depending on how quickly their circumstances and priorities change, due to new incoming work, changing external directives, or who knows what other reasons.<br><br>Again, my point is that FV handles these situations very well, no need to adjust the rules.</div>

I think you really haven't got a feel for how FV works. Standard FV does NOT focus your attention on the root item, the first item in the list. It draws one's attention to the END of the list. >><br><br>Ah, but it does, because the root item is the ONLY one that is automatically added to the chain, everything else is discretionary.<br><br><< The way it works for me, the things down near the end of the list that receive dots are the things that are high importance and/or high urgency. They receive most of the attention. As I move through them, moving up the chain, taking action as needed, it moves faster and faster till I then arrive at the other, less pressing things closer to the top of the list. Often those things get DELETED because, having just focused my time and attention on truly important things, I clearly see that they are really not that important and I don't want to be committed to them.<br><br>Sometimes I end up deleting the root item itself, for the same reason. Usually, though, I just take some small action, "opening the file", taking a closer look, thinking for a few minutes what needs to be done, and why this item has been on the list for so long, etc.<br><br>My main point is the root item and other items near the top of the list do NOT get the bulk of the attention, which you repeatedly stated in your post. They get deleted, or get some small action that helps break the ice.<br><br>The idea of the root item in FV is not to draw your attention there, but to get you to make a decision about items that have been sitting in your list for a long time WITHOUT a decision. By the time it's reached the root position, you've had plenty of time to sift that item, little and often, consciously and unconsciously. >><br><br>You've had plenty of time BECAUSE standard FV takes as long as possible to cycle tasks into that root position.  Prioritized FV is designed to reduce procrastination on high-resistance high-priority tasks and to avoid diverting attention away from high-priority tasks for low-priority tasks.<br><br>Mark recommends processing at least 3 chains per day, preferably more.  When one chain takes 2 weeks to complete, you've drifted away from the way FV is intended to be functioning.<br><br>Mind you, I have the same problem -- I keep having chains take days to complete because I get distracted or just spend enough time on each item that it adds up.  I'm trying to speed up my processing of each chain with the goal of getting to 3 chains/day, but I'm not there yet.  But I'm definitely finding that the more chains I work, the better Prioritized FV works for me.</div>

<div class="content">Deven, my main issue with P-FV is that by introducing even a single star, you completely change the dynamics of the system.   <br><br>If you like the new dynamics, great, go for it!    But it is not accurate to state, as you often have, that this is only a very minor change to the rules that puts more emphasis on what's important.  <br><br>With a single star, your attention is drawn to the root item, the one with the star.  Your attention is thus drawn to the beginning of the list, where the most stale items tend to sit, rather than the end of the list, which is where the freshest and newest and highest urgency and high priority items would naturally flow.</div>

<div class="content"><< Ah, but it does, because the root item is the ONLY one that is automatically added to the chain, everything else is discretionary. >><br><br>We will have to agree to disagree.   Yes, the first item is always included in the chain.   This does not necessarily mean that the first item gets the bulk of your attention.</div>

<div class="content"><< You've had plenty of time BECAUSE standard FV takes as long as possible to cycle tasks into that root position. >><br><br>High-priority tasks never make it into that position.   They may have *appeared* to be high priority when first added to the list.   FV's algorithm helps you sort out the *real* priorities from the *faux* priorities.   P-FV has no mechanism for that.  You better hope your stars are actually the real priorities.   With lots of conflicting priorities and commitments and projects, that's a really hard call to make.   FV sorts it all out for me, automatically.</div>
