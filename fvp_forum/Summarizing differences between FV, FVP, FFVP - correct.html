<div class="content">Hi, I have been having some great success with concepts of the FV, FVP and FFVP methodologies but I am still a bit confused between them. This is how I understand the differences:<br><br>FINAL VERSION<br>: key question after dotting a task is "What task do I want to do *before* this task"<br><br>FINAL VERSON PERFECTED<br>: key question after dotting a task is "What task do I want to do *more than* this task"<br><br>FAST FINAL VERSON PERFECTED<br>: key questions after dotting a task are (1) "Am I ready to do this now" and if not, (2) "What task do I want to do *more than*  this task" <br><br>Is this correct? Am I missing some other difference between the three methods?<br><br>And are people still finding all three versions useful or has everybody simply moved on to FFVP as the latest?</div>

<div class="content">FV:<br>From the root task, scan down asking "what do I want do do before x?". Dot the ones that answer the question and do the dotted tasks in reverse order.<br><br>FVP:<br>Like FV but after you finish a task you continue scanning from the task you just completed. Then do the last dotted task.<br><br>FFVP:<br>Like FVP but you can do the last dotted task at any time if you feel ready.<br>Alternatively, like FV but you can scan down at any time.<br>(These amount to the same thing)<br><br>Personally I have started using FV again because it allows me to handle all my current work while preventing me from forgetting any old work.</div>
