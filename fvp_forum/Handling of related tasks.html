<div class="content">What happens in the FV system if the first task of the list can't be worked on because there's another related task in the list that needs to be done before?</div>

<div class="content">Since the related task is a condition of doing the first task, you can subsume the related task into the first task.</div>

<div class="content">So all related tasks should be replaced by just one task in my FV list? But what if i have for example 10 related tasks that i need to complete in a particular order?</div>

<div class="content">I take it as a general principle not related to FV, when such happens make a list of these tasks and in the FV list simply refer to that list once. Highlight the first task todo in that reference, and also note the bigger picture of why you are doing it.</div>
