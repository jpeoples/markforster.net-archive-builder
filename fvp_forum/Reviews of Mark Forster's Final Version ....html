<div class="content"><<gets a few nice reviews >><br><br>And some criticism: <br><br><a href="http://www.donationcoder.com/forum/index.php?topic=30291.msg281912#msg281912" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.donationcoder.com/forum/index.php?topic=30291.msg281912#msg281912</a><br>"My opinion on the system itself - I was kind of meh. All that build up for some top-secret method of organization that has been refined over 10 years? I just expected more."<br><br>There's a lot going on behind the scenes of FV (and all of Mark's systems), which don't translate well beyond this site. If I recall, many of the comments on Lifehacker went something like: "And why should I care about a to-do list with more rules?". <br><br>I hosted a workshop (for therapists) at my office, whereby everyone introduced one idea that they found helpful in running their private practice. I introduced a few of Mark's ideas, doing my best to focus on the psychological advantages of each system. <br><br>In the end, folks like Stever Robbins - who seem to have a captive audience - will be the most effective mouth piece for FV</div>

<div class="content">Apologies for injecting a Biblical example.  I'm certain other examples exist but none come to mind.  Basically, people tend to say, "It's too easy, so I won't try."<br><br>10 Elisha sent a messenger to say to him, “Go, wash yourself seven times in the Jordan, and your flesh will be restored and you will be cleansed.”<br><br> 11 But Naaman went away angry and said, “I thought that he would surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of the LORD his God, wave his hand over the spot and cure me of my leprosy. 12 Are not Abana and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Couldn’t I wash in them and be cleansed?” So he turned and went off in a rage.<br><br> 13 Naaman’s servants went to him and said, “My father, if the prophet had told you to do some great thing, would you not have done it? How much more, then, when he tells you, ‘Wash and be cleansed’!”<br><br>In the same way, these "Nay-Men" are much happier attempting some great thing like GTD, or some more sensible thing like Covey "prioritize by importance A,B,C, and urgency 1,2,3, then start with A1".  Because FV doesn't is too simple and doesn't make sense, they reject it.</div>

<div class="content">Nice reply, Alan, and I think a very shrewd observation.<br><br>I'm working with a coach now to untangle some of my own knotted assumptions about my life, and one of the things I discovered about myself was my attraction to drama and The Hard. When I dispute these beliefs and try to establish what is the truth of the matter, I find that the truth is more nuanced, calmer, and not dramatic at all -- no big deal, in fact. The truth doesn't have the thrill of making lots of lists, initiating big weekly reviews, seeing oneself as a mighty desk warrior.<br><br>Anyway, excellent observation Alan. I agree, I think these guys are looking for a sharp ninja technique (raise your hands if you remember all the Moleskine hacks of years past), when the reality is much simpler. Mark's innovation here reminds me of Steve Jobs' frequent quotes where he talks about the simplicity of design, and how hard designing simplicity can be.</div>
