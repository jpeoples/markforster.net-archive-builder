<div class="content">Hello! It's really silly question, which is more suitable for robot i guess (like when do I need to turn off), but... When do you finish your FVP day?) I often find that when in the evening I want to take a break before going to bed, I'm thinking like "No! The day is not over yet, get back to work!". So maybe there is some kind of rule "How many hours a day you should work and when you should finish to stay productive"?</div>

<div class="content">Alex:<br><br>It's not a silly question. It's a very good one.<br><br>It's really up to you. Some people just use FVP in the office, some use it at home and some use it for both. Some have a definite stop time and some don't. All of these are perfectly valid ways of using it and it's best to find what suits you.<br><br>For the record, I use it all the time for everything - but that's just what suits me. I'm not claiming it's best for everyone. And I have plenty of fun and leisure tasks on the FVP list, which I tend to do in the evening - so it's not all proper work.</div>

<div class="content">Generally speaking: work enough to make sure you will reach your goals.<br><br>The purpose of work - or "productivity" - is to reach the goals you've set for your life and work.<br><br>Which goals to set is of course another question entirely.</div>
