<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">I do not understand this alternative version. How do the little things take care of themselves?<br><br>I understand the benefit of doing high-resistance stuff first. But, as Mark has always pointed out, the little commitments become big commitments if we don't take care of them.<br><br>So, in normal FV, in one of my chains I will want to check my email and check my inbox. These are not high-resistance tasks, but I want to do them because I need to do them in order to stay on track. If I wait till they bubble up to the root task of my list, it could be a few days. I don't want to go a few days between checking inbox, email, and calendar.<br><br>Maybe I have this all wrong. Maybe if I do the high-resistance tasks first, I will cycle through my entire list a few times a day. Then I don't have to worry about not getting to my email, inbox, or calendar. This seems very unlike to me, however.<br><br>I am clearly missing something here. What is it?<br><br>---------------------<br><br>Revision:<br><br>OK, maybe this is it: after I force myself to tackle the resistant tasks a number of times, they stop being resistant. This is, in fact, my experience with little and often. At some point the letter I need to write to the dishonest vendor loses its resistant quality. Now it becomes a simple matter of printing it, signing it, copying it, addressing the envelope, etc. The resistance has vanished. <br><br>So, the email, inbox, and calendar are no longer low-resistance tasks COMPARED TO the other tasks on my list which have themselves lost almost all their resistance. I no longer need to wait for the routine recurrent tasks to bubble up to the root position, because they have become high-resistance relative to everything else.<br><br>I like this idea. It is now a commonplace in psychology that avoidance increases negative emotions. The best activity is almost always to confront that which I want to avoid.</div>

<div class="content">I read it the same way you did and couldn't figure it out.  Your revision helps it make a little more sense and I can now see the possibility that it could work.  As you indicate, the important part might be the "Compared To" part of the question.<br><br>The way I think it might also work is as an alternative to the normal way of processing the list with FV.  I think that's something Mark envisions when he says that its "for all of us when we have some particularly heavy tasks to get through".<br><br>I doubt we will really know until we try it.  Like so many of Mark's systems, they sometimes sound like they can't possibly work, yet they do.  In other words try it before tweaking.</div>

<div class="content">I'm looking forward to trying it (on Monday). I am wondering if it makes sense to switch between FV and alt-FV. Mark says that alt-FV is like going uphill. Doesn't it make sense to go downhill after going uphill? Then the easier tasks will get taken care of as well.</div>

<div class="content">What about urgent items which you are not resisting?  Do you still enter them with a dot?  Guess so..<br><br>I also do not see how my creative and interesting tasks/projects will be selected in this system.<br><br>Maybe it is me, but I also do not have a lot of tasks I resist.  Can only think of one on the top of my head.  So if I break the resistance to this one, then what?  Work only on the root item with no chains?<br><br>I think this system will work for serial procrastinators and someone who really has nasty tasks on their plate.  (This person does however a deeper problem, being if his job is the right one?)</div>

<div class="content">Does every chain need to be built using the same question? Couldn't you build a 'high resistance' chain, work on that unti either the chain is done (or one of the 'reset' options from the original emails comes up), then build chain #2 using the original question? That way both the high-resistance and the 'little' stuff gets done.</div>
<h2>Reply by Nico McDonald</h2>
<div class="meta">2012-05-6 15:38</div>
<div class="content">Maybe another way to build a "cycle downhill" chain is to ask if the task is bigger than the previously selected task. (Bigger: Maybe equating to resistance as well")<br><br>If you get to an urgent task (due in the next 7 days) then it should be selected, but your question now changes for the next items after this item to: "Is the item more urgent than the previous item?"<br><br>This will have the effect that you get rid of the urgent items first and then break down the large project/tasks.</div>

<div class="content">" ... Instead of "What do I want to do before I do x?", the question becomes "What am I resisting more than x?"<br>Yes, yes, yes! <br>I use FV on work, and on a question, "What do I want to do before I do x?" often the answer was "Something. In general I want nothing" :)...<br>At my number of tasks is 90% "Should make" and about 10%, "I want to make". I am not ready to cause to transform me, the task "Should make" in tasks to "Want..."<br>I tried to make today a chain, "What am I resisting more than x?".<br>It works for me!!!<br>Today I made 9 tasks and the beginnings 2 projects.<br>Before I solved 5-7 tasks in day.<br>For me it is very important.<br>Mark, I thank you, change of a key question very much helps me!</div>

<div class="content">This could be interesting. I resist doing things I enjoy. When the moment to do it arrives, I think I should do something harder or more important. I feel guilty doing things that are just for me, or less urgent, or that I want to do -- so I don't do them. That's resistance.<br><br>I think Resisting More will be a good alternate question.<br><br>Next week is a good test week. Two errand days, with prep before most errands.</div>

<div class="content">First day "uphill." Tiring but very productive. I definitely focused on difficult tasks/projects, and made good progress on all of them. My chains tend to be long, this one was 31 items, and still have 11 items left, but only a few of them (the ones on top of the list) are of the high resistance.<br><br>Lok forward to pushing through them and going downhill on my next run!</div>

<div class="content">@pkNystrom,<br><br>I've received exactly two emails about the Final Version. The second email, which arrived on May 5, sketches an "alternative version" of FV--with the alternative to be used only in special circumstances or by especially hardy souls.<br><br>To generate this alternative to FV, Mark simply changes the question used for pre-selecting tasks.</div>

<div class="content">Today I asked "What am I resisting?", but without actually making a chain. I chose the first project I was resisting but had no excuse not to do at that moment. I'm using a prioritized list, so I didn't need to look through the entire list to know it was a good choice. The best choice, actually -- you can't get better than high-priority, high-resistance if you'll actually do it rather than stall.<br><br>I'm exhausted -- all my high-priority projects got attention -- enough attention that I don't need to do them for a few days. I'm out tomorrow, but will use it again.</div>

But the algorithms themselves do far more than that.   I think you are glossing over about 90% of what FV and FV-alt actually do:<br><br>- Universal capture<br>- Integrated frequent review of all outstanding work<br>- Sifting and sorting what really needs to be done, vs stuff that doesn't really matter<br>- Implicit prioritization - no need to pre-sort or number priorities<br>- Defeat procrastination by addressing its psychological causes<br>- Respond to changing environment, conditions, and priorities<br>- Handle urgent tasks<br><br>I could go on but I hope this is enough.</div>

<div class="content">4 day of work passed in AV hard.<br>I noticed the following: in the AV mode all chains equally difficult, "heavy".<br>In the FV mode - not so, chains happen different, both "heavy", and "easy". "Weight" of the chosen chain is set by the first, oldest task.<br>What for me it is correct? <br>I doubt...<br>So, I will work before the end of the week in the AV mode to begin all "heaviest" projects. Then I want to return to FV.<br>Probably, transition to the AV mode it is necessary to do, for example, for a week, once a month, as reset?</div>

<div class="content">This is nuts -- in a good way. Either that or I'm at that point in my cold when I don't have the energy to resist!<br><br>I predicted I'd work on my personal-improvement goals more (aka hobbies with goals), since I often resist them (out of guilt), and that resistance blocks the whole day. Instead, I'm doing paperwork. Papers invariably arrive when I don't want to deal with them, so they accumulate and resistance builds. I've done more paperwork in an hour than I usually do in a week!</div>
<h2>Reply by Cricket</h2>
<div class="meta">2012-05-9 15:55</div>
<div class="content">An insight: Sometimes I leave small paperwork jobs (like purging my "think about it" email folder, or matching receipts to the credit card statements) until they're big enough to be worth dealing with, or the month is complete, or some other magic time. That's resistance, right? It's a different type than "big ugly pile" resistance, but it's still resistance. The next few weeks will be interesting. It will be nice to be consistently on top of the paperwork, like I used to be pre-kids.</div>

<div class="content">I have not used FV for several days. So today I decided: it is good opportunity to test FV-AV for the first time. To start quickly with FV again, to gain some energy (by going through tasks which drained most of my mental energy by anticipating them) and to know that the further I will go through the ladder, the easier tasks will come. <br><br>And...it worked like a charm. I will stay with normal FV, but occasionally - when I need some change, or when being stuck, or not using FV for some time - I will switch to FV-AV as additional method how to move.</div>

If you can do that, maybe you don't need help with procrastination!  The "cycling downhill" thing is great, if you can get to the top of the hill, but that may be easier said than done.<br><br>I'm wondering how Alternative FV compares with using Prioritized FV when prioritizing by resistance?  After all, I had high-resistance tasks particularly in mind when I designed the tweak that defines Prioritized FV.  Then you could start with the task you most want to do and benefit from the laddering effect of standard FV, while still applying more focus to resisted tasks...</div>

<div class="content">Hi Deven, <br><br>I would encourage you to try AV FV (or whatever it's called!). It feels both liberating and satisfying to hit the high resistance tasks head on! Or maybe it's just me...<br><br>Remember only *some work* needs to be done on those high resistance tasks and obviously this tends to have the effect of disarming the inherent high level of resistance within. And then one can be rewarding with the first task in the pre-selected chain when it is an easy one. <br><br>I also think Mark is correct when he states that the smaller tasks take care of themselves - at least that's my experience so far.</div>

<div class="content">Alternate FV starts with the hard task, then rewards you with something easy (and guilt-free, since it's still something on the list, unless you write "eat ice cream").<br><br>I tried a few chains of Alt-FV with priorities. It worked very, very well the few times I did it.<br><br>Prioritize the list by priorities, _not_ by resistance. If things are going well, the resistance on the high priority tasks will drop.<br><br>I can see problems doing it for too long, though. Once the resistance is broken on the early (high-priority) jobs, lower-priority jobs with high resistance will have to be dotted -- taking time away from the high-priority ones.</div>

<div class="content">I don't think combining the questions into one is possible since on some level they contradict each other. A question like "what do I want to do before x *or* what am I resisting more than x?" seems like an awful lot of items will get dotted.  I also don't think a 'formal' selection rule about when to use the 'want to do before' vs the 'what am I resisting' question is necessary. <br><br>It seems like it's more of a 'gut reaction' of which question makes the most sense at the time. If that means that 10 chains are the "do before" question before hitting a root task where everything, or anything, can be done before because you really really really don't want to do the root task...that's when to switch to the "resisting more than" question.</div>

<div class="content">I don't think combining them would work, at least not for me.<br><br>"Want to do before" already has many factors. Urgency, pleasure, ease, current energy style, commitments, deadlines, size of project.<br><br>It's nice to break out the factors and concentrate on one at a time sometimes. Assuming you pre-select often enough, I'd even suggest focusing on one or two factors for each chain. Urgency (the one with a long-term view) would need more turns than, say, pleasure or joy at finishing. A cycle that focused on joy at finishing would be a great source of energy.</div>
