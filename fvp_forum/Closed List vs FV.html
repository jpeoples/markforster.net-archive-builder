<div class="content">been reading some material Mark wrote about a closed list. and of course there were in the last couple of months much discussion on a sense of fixed closure of what I will get done today. or tomorrow.<br><br>is all this out with the FV? or do they integrate together?</div>

<div class="content">Each set of preselected tasks behaves like a closed list.   Yes, you can always add urgent items to the end, but in my experience this doesn't happen that often, and when it does, it is a temporary diversion from the main work of driving that chain of dotted tasks to zero.<br><br>And then we choose another closed list, and start over again.<br><br>So, yes, there is a closed-list feature.<br><br>Your second question is whether there's a connection between FV's closed-list feature and getting closure at the end of the day.   There isn't any particular rule that explicitly requires this, but I do often find myself wanting to close out my current preselection before close of business.  And often that's exactly how it happens.   <br><br>Usually I go through 2 or 3 or 4 cycles in a day:  choose the chain of tasks, work it to zero, choose the next chain, work it to zero, choose the next one -- starting to feel the end of the day getting near -- which affects the "what do I want to do before X?" question -- resulting in a list of stuff I want to get done before close of business.<br><br>It doesn't always happen that way, but it's happened enough without me consciously trying to MAKE it happen, that I've taken notice.</div>

<div class="content">There's another closed list hiding in FV.  Allow me to reveal it to you:<br><br>From the top of your list, go down 17 tasks, and draw a line under it.  Those 17 tasks are a closed list.  <br><br>Ignore that line as you follow the standard FV rules.  Nevertheless, every chain will pick off tasks from that list until it's complete, and you never add anything to it.  When you're done that closed list, feel free to draw another line denoting another closed list.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim,<br><br>I did something like this when I converted my DWM2 list to FV.  Consider, instead of 17 tasks, an arbitrary line at some point in your list.  The closed list that Alan describes is the span of tasks from the oldest task on your list (that you must dot when preselecting per FV rules) and the arbitrary line.  Thus, since every preselection you go through will REQUIRE that you dot the oldest task, your arbitrary closed list will decrease in size by at least 1 task with every preselection.  <br><br>This can give you a feeling of completion in the "long run."  Consider setting the arbitrary line as a goal.  "I want to have cleared THIS many backlog tasks before the end of the week."  In this way it will function much like the closed lists that Mark describes in his previous works.</div>

<div class="content">I usually celebrate when I finish each page. The first one took forever, but now half the items on a page are crossed off by the time that page becomes oldest.</div>

<div class="content">Alan, I am following you, looks like a good way to clear out some old dross.</div>

<div class="content">cricket: with EN I no longer have a page, just a list, but with FV that's not a handicap.</div>

<div class="content">Then celebrate every time you finish all the tasks written on a given day. If that's too often, then a week's worth of writing. I find the push to celebrate (silly little dance) helps keep momentum going.</div>

<div class="content">I'm going to try for a while, at the start of each day, writing "knock off for the day" at the end of the list - just to see what happens. This won't bring the strict sense of closure of something like Do It Tomorrow, but I suspect it may have some beneficial effect, even if it gets bumped to the end of the list a few times.</div>

<div class="content">thank you ALL answers. i understand now that this is more flexible/powerful than at first understanding. a day list could be contained in the one overall list. or a list of projects, or a particular project with sub steps could all be in the larger list. OK, i'll work with this for a few weeks and find out what happens.</div>
