<div class="content">Now that I have absolutely no resistance in using FVP, I want to tackle my next problem: missing important tasks.<br><br>Mark Forster mentioned about this happening to him with questionless FVP which got solved by going back to standard FVP, but for me I do not think that will work.  I have used both standard and questionless FVP, then "dotting power", and then I tried changing questions, yet this kept on happening.  But most telling for me was when I tested my other tweak using randomized numbers.  I kept on missing numbers which ruined my testing, which resulted to me having to do everything all over again, and finally I think I did ten tries just to get the results that I needed.  And no I am not exaggerating.<br><br>Therefore, it seems that I not am actively resisting them, but rather I keep on not seeing the important tasks.  It seems that I need a way to highlight important tasks in my FVP list to [[enforce]] (not change) the preferred order of doing things.<br><br>I originally thought of using 5T in honor of Mark's new book, but it eventually evolved into using the Spinning Plates idea: <a href="../blog/The Spinning Plates Method of Project Control (Experimental).html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2014/3/30/the-spinning-plates-method-of-project-control-experimental.html</a><br><br>What I like about this method is that it eases one into the tweak, gradually increasing daily the number of important tasks one has to do until he reaches his limit.<br><br>Let me reiterate: this tweak is specifically for people who are missing important tasks using FVP, despite trying other ways of addressing the problem.  However, there are other benefits for using this, like increasing one's willpower.<br><br>1. Decide a time in the afternoon or evening after which you should start mopping up your tasks.  You may add an alarm into your electronic device but it is not needed.  For me, I decided my "mopping time" to be 4:00pm<br>2. Write "(add)" to  your list.  An "(add)" task means that, when you select it by FVP, you have to decide on an "important task" you have to do tomorrow by [[carefully]] scanning your list, then delete and re-write it with a minus sign in the beginning.  For example, "- Important task". <br>3. The next morning, add a vertical line, "|" to your important task's dash to make it into a plus sign, "+". For example, "+ Important task".  A "plus task" means you have to do "a day's worth of work" into it today, which by the way does not necessarily mean you have to finish the whole task.<br>4. Work your FVP list as is customary for you.<br>5. If a "plus task" is not completed but you have been able to a "day's worth of work into it," delete it and re-write it as a "minus task". If however you completed a "plus task," delete it and write "(add)" into your FVP.  <br>6. A "minus task" can be still done today if you want, but you have to add an "(add)" task into your list if you complete it.<br>7. If by "mopping time" you have no "plus tasks" left, add another "(add)" task.<br>8. All "(add)" tasks must be converted to "minus tasks" by the end of the day.<br>9. The next morning, add vertical lines, "|", to all minus and plus tasks.  If you have "double plus" tasks, choose, delete and rewrite any of your important tasks into ordinary tasks (that is, without plus or minus in the beginning) by the number of "double plus" tasks you have.  Go back to step 4.<br><br>Let me also state here: if you want to try this tweak, you [[must]] start with an important task to do [[tomorrow]], i.e. do the tweak exactly as instructed.  This is to ensure you are eased into using the tweak and not be overwhelmed by it.</div>
