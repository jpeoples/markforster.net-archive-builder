<div class="content">I like this. I used it tonight with a small list of tasks from my notebook and was pleasantly surprised at how focused and clean the design is. Compared to Toodledo, FocusPad, and FocusToDo I found pre-selection to be faster and the focus mode refreshingly simple. Have a look. It's free. Here is the description:<br><br>"A simple to do list manager which allows pre-selection of important items, re-entering of unfinished items, and import/export of items to Dropbox."<br><br>And this from the app's help section:<br><br>"I Want To is a to do list application based on the principle of preselecting tasks from a bigger task list and the working off the preselected tasks. It also allows re-entering tasks which are not completed. The app works well in conjuction with Mark Forster's Final Version task management system, Michael Lopp's' Taste of the Day system, or Bill Westerman's GSD system."<br><br>https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/i-want-to/id557137719?mt=8&ls=1</div>

<div class="content">wow! interesting app. I've tried them ALL. and while this one is simple, has some, what to me seemed obvious, yet never done on one screen simple level.<br><br>select tasks. such as here with star.<br>then simple on/off toggle to show hide the starred items.<br><br>yeah, plenty of apps where there is star and show starred items, they take too many steps, screens to get to and back.<br><br>this app is not yet perfect, so I'll be following up with developer with simple suggestion.<br><br>thanks for posting.</div>

<div class="content">Hello,<br><br>Has anyone here tried Bill Westerman's GSD system mentioned above?<br><a href="http://blog.utilware.com/gsd" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://blog.utilware.com/gsd</a><br>I hadn't heard about it before, but it seems interesting and could certainly be combined with many of Mark's ideas.</div>

<div class="content">@Keith thank you so much for <a href="http://blog.utilware.com/gsd" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://blog.utilware.com/gsd</a><br>It helped me a lot. I realized reading it that it is in many way the method I follow naturally.<br>I have tried it for a week now and I am not fed up of it. Il like the way it force me to do the right things at the right time. I feel nice with it. I think I will keep it definitively<br><br>I am really astonished how the author has kept many things of MF but also from others methods. <br>It is really efficient with me and much lighter than GTD or some complicated systems</div>
