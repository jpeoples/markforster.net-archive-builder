<div class="content">My sincere compliments, maestro! The Final Versions seems to be simple yet powerful personal effectivity system. The first impressions are just wonderful!<br><br>However, there is an issue I can't get out from my head - how do you deal with the tendency to procrastinate? Sometimes we tend to commit to inconvenient tasks as late as possible and at this point it may be too late for completing the whole task for the deadline. How do you address that issue in FV?</div>

<div class="content">Good question that needs some attention!<br><br>Mark talked about Urgency meaning when a task should be started.  If you were to calculate, it would be<br> [when it's due] -[how long it will take] -[desired safety factor].  <br>And how long is <br>[how much work] / [how much you would do each day].  <br><br>Now forget the math, and just try to be aware of when you will need to have started if you are to make it.  Now you should be able to feel the panic meter rising before it needs starting, rather than after it's already too late.</div>

<div class="content">Well I don't know what is the matter with me at the moment.  Every day and evening I make plans on what I am going to do, and then promptly ignore my list and do something completely different (and generally unproductive).  I think I just need to get some more sleep!</div>

<div class="content">What I do is I ask myself "Is this task necessary?", if not, I don't add it to the list to begin with.<br><br>This clears up my stuff big time. I also don't add any "Someday" tasks to it, I keep them on a separate list.</div>

<div class="content">There a several ways in which FV deals with the issue of procrastination, including:<br><br>1. The systematic use of the first task on the list.<br><br>2. Little and often<br><br>3. Construction of a "structured procrastination" chain.<br><br>But I think the most important is the question itself. You presumably don't want to miss deadlines, so sooner or later the question "What do you want to do before x" should pre-select the task you are procrastinating.</div>

<div class="content">Alison:<br><br><<Well I don't know what is the matter with me at the moment.>><br><br>IMHO, an honest to your question is: "How the hell should I know?" David Allen's answer to your question is something like: "I'm guilty of this myself".<br><br>I think S. Pressfield "War of Art" provides the best answer: You need to do battle... to fight like mad to avoid succumbing to resistance/procrastination. His solution is a mix of ingrained habits and spiritualism.</div>

<div class="content">Alison:<br><br><< Every day and evening I make plans on what I am going to do, and then promptly ignore my list and do something completely different (and generally unproductive).>><br><br>Actually the answer with FV is very simple. Put the completely different and unproductive thing at the end of your list and put a dot against it. Then do it without guilt.</div>

<div class="content">Alison,<br><br>Sleep is the foundation: if you're not getting enough then everything is hard. <br><br>But, if you're like me, one of the hardest things is re-establishing proper sleeping patterns when you're too tired to resist the temptation to dip into social networks, watch a whole episode (or two or three) of that US TV series you were given for Christmas, or whatever trap you have fallen into.<br><br>The logical advice is both obvious and useless. I wish you luck!</div>

<div class="content">will:<br><br>I always put TV series etc on my list. That means I can watch them without guilt in a systematic way. As for going to bed, put "Go To Bed" at the end of the list and put a dot next to it.</div>

<div class="content">Mark, the logic is impeccable. Except that when I get tired, I don't look at the list. <br><br>This reinforces the need to put "Go to bed" on the list to stop me getting to that state.</div>

<div class="content">Thank you for the responses which have made me chuckle! The answer is a mixture of more sleep and a healthy dose of self discipline! My unproductiveness tends to be aimlessly wondering around the internet - but I need it active for my work so can't just switch it off which seems to obvious answer! <br><br>And it is avoidance - although not sure why I am avoiding some tasks!<br><br>I also think the 'ingrained' habits is a great tip - it's when I fall off the habits wagon that things get tricky!<br><br>Anyway - to get back on track - I have put a reminder in my phone to beep at me around 10pm to encourage me to think about bedtime and do my going to bed routines. Also transferring to an FV list - lets see how it goes! Thanks for the tips!</div>
