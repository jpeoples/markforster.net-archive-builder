<div class="content">I like very much FV: it has become my current system. Despite of this, I really miss the dismissal process. I tend to accumlate tasks at a rate greater than my execution rate, so the list grows to an unmanageable size.<br><br>I found a lean solution: AF4, with the added rule consisting in treating each of the two lists of AF4 (closed and open) according to the FV rules.<br><br>Simple, very effective ...... nearly perfect!</div>

<div class="content">You might have a point. With AF1, I see an entire list of things that I don't want to deal with. The size of the list sometimes jolts me into realizing I need to dismiss most of them. Or I deal with the easiest (just open the folder), turn the page, and postpone dealing with the worst as long as possible.<br><br>With FV, each chain has one or two old things. In one way, that's nice -- only one hard decision each chain. I find, though, that if it's only one thing, one small thing, then I keep the project active -- open the folder every few weeks -- rather than dismiss it.<br><br>I often apply FV to my daily goals list. It's only 15 or so lines, and each chain is about 3 tasks. Very smooth workflow.</div>

<div class="content">@ nick61 : Can you elaborate how you process your idea?<br><br>Basics<br><br>- According to AF4 you have to work on the backlog as long as tasks are standing out. Only after one pass without selecting a task you do a 1 pass run through the active list, before returning to the backlog.<br><br>- According to FV you always have to select at least the oldest task in the list.<br><br>If I do combine AF4 and FV, as per your suggestion, I will always work on all the tasks in the backlog before being allowed to do a pass in the active list, which then automatically becomes the new backlog. It seems that one has to tinker with the preselection process in FV : use the stand out rule of AF4 to choose the root task and only then apply the FV rules …<br><br>Am I missing something?</div>

<div class="content">@stefano:<br><br>I spend most of the time processing chains in the cloesed list.<br><br>*moving from cloese to open list*:<br>I execute one chain in the open list [basically to be sure not to miss urgent tasks] when:<br>- I've the feeling that too much time has passed from the execution of the last chain in the open list;<br>- many items has been added to the open list since the execution of the last chain in the open list;<br><br>*dismissal*:<br>I use the length of the open list to decide when dismiss the closed list [a huge open list is a symptom -- for me -- of a process going out of controll].<br><br>*FV*.<br>I always start a chain selecting the first item, regardless of the type of list (open/closed).</div>
