<div class="content">I'm going to try out FV today on paper, using my existing list. However, I'm nervous about getting stuck with a set of preselect dots after a period of work. If I need to 'break the chain' due to circumstances, I don't want to leave the dots hanging, and I don't want to cross off and reenter the undone tasks at the end. So I will use a pencil in the preselect phase, and reinforce the current task with a penned dot.<br><br>Baby steps. . .</div>

<div class="content">If I mistakenly dot a task, I draw an x over the dot.  But why should you have to break a chain?  If you get interrupted by something, you can return to the task later.  Of course if the bank closed before you left to go there, I guess that's a reason.</div>

<div class="content">Ubi, my preferred tools are pad and (propelling) pencil, so easy enough to erase erroneous dot when necessary.<br><br>Neil</div>

<div class="content">From the instructions:<br><br><<If at any stage you find that a task on the list is no longer relevant, then delete it.<br><br>If you find that your preselected list is no longer relevant (e.g. if you have had a long break away from the list), then scrap the preselection and reselect from the beginning. A shorter way to do this is to reselect only from the last preselected task which you haven't done yet.>><br><br>So, yes, use pencil.</div>

<div class="content">This thread was supposed to be about what happens when relevance of the preselected chain is lost, not about placing a dot by mistake.  Mark already anticipated the question:<br><br><< If you find that your preselected list is no longer relevant (e.g. if you have had a long break away from the list), then scrap the preselection and reselect from the beginning. A shorter way to do this is to reselect only from the last preselected task which you haven't done yet.>><br><br>But I'm still not sure about the mechanics of this scrapping procedure (for a paper-based implementation). That's why I'm using a pencil for the preselect dots, just in case I want to do a reselect.</div>

<div class="content">I'm going with pen to promote manageable, firm decisions. Otherwise I'm likely to dot everything in sight, oblivious to the amount of time available, and form a habit of erasing whenever I return to my desk a few hours later.</div>

<div class="content">Bernie, Each dot becomes the new benchmark. By the fifth dot, you have a very important benchmark. It's unlikely you'll find something you want to do even more.</div>

<div class="content">It seems that a lot of people are confusing "want to do more" with "want to do before". It's the latter that Mark mentions in the FV instructions! The question is "Do I want to do X before Y (for whatever reason)?"<br><br>I've got a feeling this could use some clarification in the instructions :).</div>

<div class="content">Actually, Mr. Forster has mentioned it a couple of times here in the forum already. The question is "BEFORE" and the difference is quite meaningful. Besides, just because I want to do Y more than X doesn't mean I can. If Y is "find a way to do FV on an iPad" and X is "pay for an iPad", I certainly want to do Y more, but I can't. I have to do X before...</div>

<div class="content">I'm not sure it needs more clarity, we just need to read it properly!  I have a bad habit of scanning stuff I'm anxious to get through (and make a start on!) and it's easy to not fully weigh up everything written!</div>

<div class="content">Cricket,<br><<Bernie, Each dot becomes the new benchmark. By the fifth dot, you have a very important benchmark. It's unlikely you'll find something you want to do even more.>><br><br>My two ladders preselected so far have consisted of ten and eleven items. One of my troubles with TM is that most of my days are extremely flexible, and so "what I want to do before x" often turns into "Oh my, I almost forgot about that one ... I REALLY want to do that one really soon ..." and there's very little to stop me doing it before all the rest.<br><br>Nevertheless, no complaints at this point. It has been a nice experience, and I've gotten to several high-resistance things while swatting away at the gnats that are just slightly too small too stand out in the prior systems.</div>

<div class="content">I think that by doing it on paper (or without resorting the list electronically) might help with the "Oh my, I almost forgot about that one ..." issue.  I'm preselecting from oldest to newest and then processing from newest to oldest by scanning the entire list twice from two different perspectives.<br><br>When possessing those preselected tasks, I'm not studying the list as I scan backwards looking for a dot.  But my subconscious seems to remember what I saw when I do my next cycle of preselecting.<br><br>But none of us have had long enough with FV to really know what makes it tick except for Mark.</div>

There's really been no trouble at all, though. The only reason to mention it was to point out why I'm staying away from pencil.</div>
