<div class="content">The rules say<br>"If one or more very urgent things come up, write them at the end of the list and mark them with a dot so that they are done next. If something already on the list becomes very urgent, then move it to the end of the list and mark it with a dot in the same way."<br><br>What does this mean?  "when you say write them to the end of the list and mark them with a dot so they are done next" when do you mean they will be done?  Is it after finishing the current selection list. Is it because nothing else will be selected because there is nothing that you would like to do before doing this task?<br><br>Also what is the reason of moving an item that's currently on the list that has become urgent the end of the list?<br><br>Thanks<br><br> Steve</div>

<div class="content">My understanding is that with moving the urgent task to the end of the list and marking it with a dot you are actually adding that item to the current preselected list you are working on.<br><br>Now you have the following choices:<br><br>- either you finish the task you are working on and then follow the procedure to always work on the last dotted item and hence do handle the urgent matter<br><br>- or, if it is possible, you stop working on the current task and immediately work off the urgent one<br><br>In both cases you automatically return to the normal FV flow of clearing the preselected list as advised.<br><br>This is a wonderful strategy to handle urgent items!</div>

<div class="content">I view this as an essential feature of FV's success. <br>SF had something similar, which is why I was able to stick with it. The AFs did not, and I found them much too rigid for real life.<br>I use this safety valve infrequently. But because it is there I can relax in the knowledge that my system can handle whatever my days throws at me.</div>

<div class="content">thank you Stefano and Moises,<br><br>I think I understand this now. <br><br>Urgent tasks that come up get automatically put on the preselected list and because they are bottom to get worked on almost immediately.<br><br>Nonurgent tasks that come up while working on the preselected list get put on the bottom of the regular list and get processed normally through the list.<br><br>thanks<br><br>Steve</div>
