<div class="content">I know FV from a week ago. I think that it has the simplicity and elegance of things that are plenty of "inspiration and transpiration", let us say, lot of creativity, reflection and elaboration.<br><br>To use FV I am setting up a system to implement FV with the free version of Toodledo (<a href="http://www.toodledo.com)," target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.toodledo.com),</a> I want to share the system and results here in a few weeks. <br><br>Meanwhile any related ideas will be welcome.</div>

<div class="content">Julio,<br><br>I've been using FV with Toodledo for a few months and I'm very happy with the results.  I use the Toodledo Outlook Sync tool to keep my Outlook and Toodledo tasks in sync.<br><br>I mainly work in Outlook and dump all tasks into the "FV" category.  When it is time to craft a chain, I go down the list and change the priority of the chosen tasks to "High".  I have an Outlook Task View set to "FV Chain".  When I change to that view, I see only the selected tasks.  While working the chain, I either mark the task as completed or, if it is not yet complete, I change the priority back to medium (the default).  It disappears from the chain view but it is still on my FV list.<br><br>An advantage of this system is that I can work the same chain from my iPhone or iPad, using the Toodledo App.  I set up my Hotlist to include only High Priority items, resulting in the same view as in Outlook.<br><br>I have also written a few macros in Outlook that enable me to convert received emails into FV tasks with a click and to write new FV tasks from any Outlook window.<br><br>Good luck with your experiment.  I look forward to hearing about your results.</div>
