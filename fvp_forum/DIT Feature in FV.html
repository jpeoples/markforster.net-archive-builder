<div class="content">Dear Mark<br><br>Thanks for giving us the instructions about FV, I have tried it and it worked pretty well (I have got the feeling of "flow") this whole morning. <br><br>I think one of the best things about FV is, I really have the feeling that "I am now working on the right task at the time being". In addition, if any urgent task comes out, I could really handle such task easily without breaking the flow (To me, when working on any urgent task in AF or SF, it really lost the momentum, but FV handle this very well). <br><br>Thanks Mark, but I have one minor question, as you have mentioned before, FV has covered the idea of DIT, in which you can decide the workload of the day, and you will know whether you are overworked or not. But it seemed that it doesn't cover this feature in the instructions, so is this idea already ignored during the evolution of FV? <br><br>This is only a minor question, as I have already experienced the power of FV, it really works to me, thanks a lot Mark.</div>
