<div class="content">I was procrastinating between tasks by scanning news feeds, and came upon this interesting article in the Harvard Business Review:<br><br><a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/bregman/2009/05/two-lists-you-should-look-at-e.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.hbr.org/bregman/2009/05/two-lists-you-should-look-at-e.html</a><br><br>reprinted at<br><br><a href="http://lifehacker.com/5921433/two-lists-you-should-look-at-every-morning" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://lifehacker.com/5921433/two-lists-you-should-look-at-every-morning</a><br><br>And it made me think – does it really make sense to list explicitly the potential tasks I plan deliberately not to do? And then check it and perhaps update it daily?<br><br>When using FV, I often have an issue with wanting or needing to defer action on the root task. If it's out of context when preselecting, I skip over it (without moving it to the end) and make the next in-context task the root. If I don't have that excuse, I select it and sometimes just don't ever get back to the root when I work the chain. <br><br>Perhaps a way out is to admit that this task is something I have chosen to ignore, and put it on the Ignore list. Then each morning, I can scan the Ignore list first and honestly go about my day using the Focus (FV) list. This seems more straightforward than maintaining a Someday/Maybe list, or using a Tickler or Reminder system merely to put off dealing with unpleasant tasks. It could also be useful for stimulating discussions with the boss, colleagues, spouse, etc. – "Want to know what I'm ignoring these days?"  ;-)<br><br>What do you all think?</div>

<div class="content">I often have too many projects on the go, and none get enough attention to be worth doing. The act of moving something to the "ignore for now" list (aka Someday/Maybe or Deferred Indefinitely") helps me ignore it. I can re-activate a project whenever I want, but have to be careful. Just because I had a great few weeks and pulled ahead on the active projects doesn't mean it's safe to activate a few more.</div>

<div class="content">I'm combining stuff into project lists. If the FV list is cluttered with things I'm not prepared to work on yet, those things belong as Part of a larger project which has things I am prepared to do soon. So my FV list is perpetually to be the active stuff, but pointing at projects that will feed the next stuff into FV as they become ready.</div>

<div class="content">Peter Bregman seems like a nice guy. But man, if timing, luck and some gumption are on your side (ok, writing for HBR doesn't hurt), you can take a few common sense ideas and churn them into a pot of gold.</div>
