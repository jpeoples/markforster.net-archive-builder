<div class="content">You know, I can imagine Mark gets weary of all the changes we all constantly make to his systems...<br>That said, I wonder if anyone has used FV to select daily to-dos. <br>Let me try to explain what I'm after:<br>I create a daily "must do" list. Usually items from my calendar. I add a "possible do" list which contains action steps needed for calendar items that are approaching. I try to keep these tasks to ones that I really want to get moving on today. They don't go in the must do list because they really aren't must dos.<br>As you can see, it's the deadline that is giving me a way of determining urgency/importance.<br>But here is where I struggle:<br>I have a list of "non deadline" tasks. How do I select some to put on my "possible" list? I don't want to add items which I would like to do. No, I want to identify some (or even one) items that I really (may) work on today.<br>My initial thought is to just do a fv scan at the beginning of the day and enter the selected tasks on the possible list. This would (as I understand the systems, rule out fvp, but fv might work. Maybe with the question "what do I want to do today more than...?"<br>What I'd like is to only do one scan per day to select non deadline tasks that are truely something I "may" work on today. <br>Am I crazy?</div>

<div class="content">I do this:<br>Before I start dotting anything, I add everything from my daily list to the end of my big list.<br>I then make chains on that big list during the day. Sometimes some of the old stuff is more important than the daily stuff, and will get done instead of the daily stuff, but I see that as a good thing.</div>
