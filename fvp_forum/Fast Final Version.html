<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2016-07-26 7:27</div>
<div class="content">Mark's hinting of a possible new system made me think of this, a faster way to do FV/FVP.<br><br>1. Mark the oldest unactioned task.<br>2. Scan down and mark the task that answers the question: "Which task do I want to do more than the oldest task?"<br>3. Do the marked task, then cross out; if needed, rewrite at the end.<br>4. From this last marked task, repeat steps 2 and 3 until you reach the end of the list.<br>5. Do the oldest unactioned task (since there is no more task in the list that you want to do more than this), then cross out; if needed, rewrite at the end..<br>6. Go back to step 1.</div>

<div class="content">nuntym,<br>This is basically identical to a system I created a while back, only there's no need to ask the question. You can get the same effect faster by scanning the list and doing what stands out, bearing in mind you MUST do the top task when you reach it.<br><br>Here is the thread: <a href="../general_forum/A simple new system.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2296859</a><br><br>Several folks had some success with it, including Mark.</div>

<div class="content">Austin<br><br>I've used your system quite a bit since you originally posted it - with some tweaks of course!<br><br>I find I prefer to use it when processing a "day list" rather than the "catch all" that you intended.</div>

<div class="content">Basically this is just going round and round the list doing whatever stands out, with the one exception that you have to do the first task on the list on every pass. Not a bad system.</div>

<div class="content">My goal was to retain some of the advantages of FV (no pages, pressure on the oldest task, responsive and adaptable) but with single task selection instead of a chain.</div>

<div class="content">Ah, awesome Austin :) <br><br>Yeah with all the time we have been doing this, duplications of systems are bound to happen.<br><br>I like how the system feels right now, though it has been only a couple of days.</div>

<div class="content">An added tweak I am using (which I would probably use for all other list systems since it seems to be effective and can be used on others) is that if an urgent matter needs to be done and is listed further from my current position in the list, I just add an exclamation point, which signals me that once I have done the said urgent task I am supposed to come back to my last marked item.</div>

<div class="content">Really like this and will give this a go over next few days (except for the exclamation tweak, which I don't feel I would need). I struggle a lot with the no list concept of only being able to add a task by working on it immediately, it feels a bit better being able to add tasks that I will want / need to do at some point during the day i.e. as they come to mind. <br><br>Going to work on a daily version, at the end of the day closing out the full page by underlining it and making a diagonal line to the top corner of the page. I like the idea of sweeping the page out of the way at the end of the day, plus it leaves a history of items worked on and not worked on. <br><br>Thought about having current date on a page with next day's date on the following page. In this way there is a link between 'today' and 'tomorrow'.  New entries go on today's page (unless of course they have a specific future start date). Re-entered items can be written at the end of today's list *or* they can be entered onto tomorrow's list.</div>

<div class="content">Actually...not sure it's a great idea to have a 'tomorrow date', may drop that for now...</div>

<div class="content">Leon wrote:<br><< Thought about having current date on a page with next day's date on the following page >><br>etc.<br><br>I've experimented with many variations on this theme—trying to get the best of both worlds from No-List and DIT. I've tried keeping a DIT diary/notebook but working it following No-list methods; I've tried different combinations of lists; combinations of lists and inboxes, calendars and ticklers, etc.<br><br>In the end, I found a simple approach that works pretty well. If I get a new incoming task (an action-item in a meeting, a task buried in an email, a verbal request from a co-worker, or just something comes to mind that I need to address), then I just capture it in OneNote, in the default "quicknotes" location for new notes. If I have time, I also write down the next action(s) in the OneNote. <br><br>From that point, I just treat all the new entries in OneNote as another inbox, which gets cleared out every day or so.  It's very similar to Mark's DIT/"yesterbox" method—clear out all of yesterday's email every day.<br><br>For personal items I do the same thing, but I use Evernote instead of OneNote.  (Thanks to Mark's blog posts for turning me on to Evernote again!  It's really improved since I last tried it.)<br><br><a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/tag/evernote" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/tag/evernote</a><br><br>And then, it just falls into my daily routine to clear out these inboxes. Either it comes to mind naturally (and I write "Clear OneNote" on my no-list), or I am prompted to do it with my daily checklists.</div>

<div class="content">Had a great day using this system yesterday! Very nimble, intuitive and little resistance...Will continue to use it and see if it sticks...I'm using a large Moleskine notebook and closing the list with by underlining the list (i.e. I've dropped the diagonal line) when I've decided to finish for the day.</div>

<div class="content">Slight alterations made: Now using 2 independent working lists per 2 pages in a large moleskine (Personal - left page , Professional - right page). At the end of the day both lists are underlined to close them. I don't need a professional list at weekends so use a personal list over Sat and Sun, although each day could have separate lists if preferred. <br><br>Slight change to the root task (i.e. the first task at the top of the list). I'm treating the root task as per FVP in that it does not need to be worked on if it is not the right moment. This saves having to cross the root task out and re-write it at the end of the list. However, the rule stays for selecting only one task to work on before moving down the list from the item just worked on. (Hope that makes sense). <br><br>It seems very flexible and easy to use so far....!</div>

<div class="content">That's an interesting tweak.<br><br>I may try that with my Bullet Journal approach in my Moleskine notebook (large = about A5 size).<br><br>As I number my pages, I can start the next day underneath the previous day and not waste space that would occur with a 'short' number of tasks if one starts the next pair of lists on new pages.<br><br>On the other hand, the space below each can be used for scribbling, ideas, random thoughts, diagrams, contact details etc.<br><br>A luta continua</div>
