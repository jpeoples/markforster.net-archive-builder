It aims at keeping things as simple as possible and yet giving you utmost functionality.<br><br>Today there are many task management methodologies , however none of them is a "one size fits all" .

It gives you the flexibility and power to handle your tasks and projects how you want, whether you'd like to follow Focus List, GTD , DIT , 43 Folders etc, or a combination of them, you can do it easily using Accomplist.<br><br>Accomplist is available on the AppStore for iPhone and iPad and a web version is under development.<br><br>Also, on April 5th we have an exciting new release planned. <br>We'd be glad to give out promocodes to anyone interested. <br>Please contact us via our facebook page : www.facebook.com/Appsolutelee<br><br>We'd love to hear about what you have think of accomplist.<br><br>You can check out our introductory video at : <br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__E28QrxX1A&hd=1</div>

<div class="content">Just tried out the app. It's very innovative, love the simplicity of everything. The concept of smart tags and filtering is very useful. However i think u need an android version, and a web version ! I'm sure many people will find it very useful.</div>
