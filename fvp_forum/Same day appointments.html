<div class="content">Scenario: I have a scheduled appointment at 10:00am listed on Outlook Calendar. <br><br>Any views on whether it's best to <br><br>a) Temporarily disengage FV to engage with the appointment i.e. by either leaving the selected task active or crossing it out etc., <br><br>or b) Entering the appointment into FV on the same day and then preselecting the appointment as part of a chain.<br><br>I'm thinking a) is more straight forward. On the other hand option b) may help give a clearer structure to the day. <br><br>What are other people doing? <br><br>PS I'm finding the system fantastic for putting together a balanced daily routine.</div>

<div class="content">Definitely a.  Set an alarm for 30 minutes before so you can wind up what you were doing.</div>

<div class="content">I agree with a., but not necessarily with setting an alarm in advance. Sometimes a sudden stop in the middle of a sentence actually helps. It depends on:<br>- whether you need to complete before the interruption<br>- the nature of the task<br>- the nature of the interruption.</div>

<div class="content">I just stop what I'm doing a few minutes before the meeting (just enough time to call in to the conference call, or get to the conference room, or leave for the appt, or whatever).<br><br>When the meeting is done I just pick up with FV where I left off.</div>

<div class="content">Same as Seraphim. A scheduled appointment already gives your day a structure, FV must fit in it, not try to adapt to it. Within the structure of your day, FV helps you structure how you spend your time moving forward.</div>

<div class="content">Add another vote for a). FV is there to help you utilize / maximize your discretionary time. Appointments are not discretionary.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the replies, of which I agree...<br><br>So how about something that one wants to do on a certain day but the exact time isn't crucial. I'm thinking about running fitness sessions, on my own, that do not have to be done at a set time. <br><br>I'm trying a) having it as a reminder note on my calendar. I'm sort of also trying b) having it as a recurring item in FV. <br><br>Is anybody else planning exercise sessions (or similar, e.g. non scheduled music practice etc.) using FV? If so how is it working for you?</div>

<div class="content">I find exercise has to be part of my routine. I walk the kids to school (even though they're old enough to go alone), then take the long way home. It's the only thing that works for me.<br><br>Other things, like cleaning the kitchen and doing laundry, tend to get chosen early because I want to do them before many other things (such as anything needing the table).<br><br>So, the answer is that it depends.<br><br>As for meetings, the first chain of my day would be "What do I want to do before the meeting?" rather than "before X?" That type of question can be risky, though -- it's too close to the old "What do I want to do before the end of the day?"<br><br>I know Mark's commented on this type of thing, but I can't find / remember what he said. (Definitely need an FAQ or "most common mistakes" section.)</div>

<div class="content">Only Saturday can be FV'd for exercise.  Essentially going to exercise means stopping all other work.  So I can put Exercise on my list, but once I select it and get to it, anything selected before that becomes moot.  So deciding to exercise is the same as dropping out of the system.  I choose it when I feel enough has been done and/or the right time of day has come.<br><br>Weekdays I schedule it.</div>

<div class="content">I have several recurring tasks that are set for certain days but not for any particular time within the day. When those pop up, they simply go on my FV list and are processed like any other task. (Because of how I'm using Toodledo, the recurring tasks appear as "old" tasks, getting the first dot in a chain. In a paper-and-pen environment, they would probably be written at the end.)<br><br>The slight difference between my scenario, though, and your hypothetical one is that my tasks are typically 5-10 minutes each while "exercising" should be at least a half-hour.</div>
