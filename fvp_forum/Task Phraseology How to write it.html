<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2012-04-2 16:47</div>
<div class="content">I find the discussion on task phraseology rather interesting.  I’ve had the internal debate on it for years now and I’ve swung this way and that on the topic.  I like the suggestions I’ve heard in another post (including Mark Forster’s approach) and I thought I’d elevate the topic to its own thread.<br><br>I began with the GTD way, using successful outcome phraseology for my project list (ie: stating the intended outcome of the project in the past tense as though it has been done already, eg:  “Marketing Strategy reviewed”) and next action phraseology for actions on my @context lists.  My @context lists became “tangled” for lack of a better term (rambling things that didn’t match up with my project list very well).  So I scrapped them and worked solely off of my project list for awhile using the successful outcome phraseology for everything.  It worked pretty well.  It all stayed on one list, the list triggered a brainstorm of next actions that I could take in my current context (ie: it worked in all contexts) and I didn’t feel pressured to plan it all out upon entry beyond defining what I wanted.  But I still hated the GTD weekly root canal…I mean weekly review.  Mark’s systems, with the “automatic” filtering of the list and review of only things that you resisted in small digestible chunks (vs GTD’s vigorous flossing of every cavity in your system) appealed to me, and I tried them out.  <br><br>AF1 worked well with the successful outcome phraseology, but SF did not.  Imagine if half the items on your SF list were at the “War and Peace read” level and you can see that your C2 would fill up in short order, forcing you to dismiss or action many a C1.  I tended to action most items in my C1 in a desperate attempt to keep those tasks alive in my SF list, which of course overloaded the C2 of the next page…  So I tried the next action phraseology in SF (break projects down to their next actions and write them beginning with an active verb to suggest a command, or an action to take).  SF worked much more smoothly for me with the next action phraseology, and I flew through my list.  But after a few months I noticed that my SF list grew faster than I could work it.  <br><br>In retrospect, in both methods I had an urge or compulsion to brainstorm the actions I intended to take (GTD calls it project planning.)  The difference was that with the next action phraseology I felt I had to record the outcome of said planning in terms of next actions to take on my list, while with the successful outcome phraseology I did not feel so inclined.  This explains why my GTD @context lists became so unwieldy and unbalanced, and why my SF list grew faster than I could work it when I used the next action phraseology.  <br><br>I have since gone back to the successful outcome phraseology because it allows me the creative latitude to come up with any next action I like that fits my current context (if such a next action exists of course), and it keeps my list succinct and manageable.  It kind of feels like the stated task depicts that particular task’s “Future Self” from Mark’s book “How to Make Your Dreams Come True” (or as I like to say “How to Make Your Dreams Come To You”).  As such each task on my list generates a miniature “pull state” with respect to that task in my mind.  <br>I also went back because I can’t quash the compulsion to document the next actions resulting from my creative latitude when I use the next action phraseology.  This compulsion tends to overload any system I try it with, which always results eventually in a sense of overwhelm.  <br><br>But that’s me.  There’s also a strong case for next action phraseology out there I’m sure.  Bernie uses somewhat of a combination in which he states a noun followed by an action phrase that describes the successful outcome, but in a present tense “command.”  (eg:  “Marketing Strategy provide feedback”) which he finds conducive to list scanning (a common thing in FV).  And Mark tends to avoid verbs altogether if possible, preferring instead a simple reference tag.  (eg: “Marketing Strategy”)<br><br>What’s your tactic?</div>

<div class="content">I use a hybrid system. Everything -- yes, everything -- on my list has next action and successful outcome defined, but I usually write neither. Successful outcomes vary, and sometimes they have layers. Ideal would be confidently singing in public next fall. Realistic is enjoy learning and sing nervously at guild by Christmas.<br><br>If I can't look at the line and automatically know outcome and next action, the next action is defining them. Likewise, if I don't know what the time constraints are (which includes a rough plan and timeline), then it's urgent I figure them out.<br><br>As for what I write down? I'm lazy. I write enough to remind me, and no more. I'm also too lazy to get another sheet for what I fool myself into believing will be quick notes. When that happens, I block it off so I know it's part of the project rather than a list I need to read each cycle through FV, and move on. (That habit didn't work with AF. Some pages had 31 lines of tasks. Others had 5 tasks and project notes.)</div>

<div class="content">I used the GTD method for a long time. I think I understand David Allen's reasoning behind using it, but I usually found it to be unnecessary. I've been on a "simplification" journey and I much prefer Mark's method of simply jotting down enough words to jog your memory. I do generally add the action verb that Mark omits (e.g. "pay property taxes"), but I've begun experimenting with omitting that too (e.g. "property taxes," "Easter website/projector image" or just "Easter image").</div>

<div class="content">A lot of discussions here emphasize action and wording. One of Mark's main insights I would say is how feeling affects the actions/behaviours we are willing to do. One of his early questions was "How good do I feel?". Procrastination is due to not feeling ready. If feeling good comes first perhaps all tasks get done in good timing.</div>

<div class="content">I feel pretty strongly about starting the task description with an action verb.  Right now, I'm restricting myself to only seven: (1) Arrange, (2) Buy, (3) Clean [up], (4) Contact, (5) Learn [about], (6) Play, and (7) Write [about].  It's interesting that using certain verbs seems to reduce my resistance to some tasks, e.g. "Learn about X" rather than "Read X" or "Study X." Play is a catch-all for anything non-work-related, including exercise, practicing piano, watching TV, going out with the wife, or other fun stuff.</div>

<div class="content">I have a problem here with the idea that if you phrase your tasks correctly it will solve your problems with getting the tasks done. i don't believe it for a second. It may give you a temporary lift, but it will only be temporary.<br><br>Therefore my aim in writing tasks is to make writing them as fast as possible. Not necessarily by keeping them as short as possible, but by keeping the thinking overhead small. Trying to force tasks into some preconceived mould is a good way of adding stress to the system. If the first way I think of a task is "Bill: Project X" then that's what I write down. if the first way is "Call Bill re Project X" then that's what I write down. If it's "Consult with Bill re possible unintended consequences of implementing the Project X territorial divisions" then that's what I write down (I don't often go for that one!). The point is that I don't bother with fitting the task to some set of rules. <br><br>The idea for instance of having to include one of seven action verbs (and only one of those seven) strikes horror into my heart!<br><br>I also make great use of the question mark at the end of the task, which is a multifaceted tool, e.g.<br><br>Seven action verbs?<br>Simplicity?<br>Unintended consequences?<br>Bill replied?<br>Bill right person?</div>

<div class="content">Interesting thread and very opportune for me.<br><br>I've always struggled with applying the "little & often" principle to the tasks and I'm now thinking that my GTD-old habit of forcing them into a "<verb> <subject>" is probably not helping… Mark's approach of simply writing the "<subject>" of the task might help inducing the "little" behaviour by leaving it open to decide at the moment how to tackle it, rather than defining it before hand.<br><br>Case in point, I had been procrastinating badly when a chain just "froze" after reaching one particularly "hairy" task (something like):<br><br>[•] Add sliding banners to the homepage<br><br>Although it seems simple on the face of it, the reality of when I *finally* started working on it was that there were A LOT of hidden small things to do before I could finally *add* the banners to the homepage (e.g. research plugins, try them out, tweak the site theme, etc.). In fact, at the end of the first "session" I was nowhere near being able to *add* them to the homepage, like the wording of the task indicated.<br><br>You could argue that this wasn't really the very first "next action" I could do and it was in fact a small "project" (in GTD parlance), but the point here is that at the time of writing it all seemed fine and logical to me (and to scrutinise it further at the time would just be useless overhead).<br><br>On the other hand…<br><br>[•] Sliding banners<br><br>… simply means to "work on" the subject matter, leaving it open to decide what little piece to do of the task before moving on to another one.<br><br>It's only been a couple of days but the psychological effect of the change feels very good.</div>

<div class="content">Dave D asked: <<How do you get by without having a "Do" type verb on this list? For example, "Do this year's taxes", or "Collect water sample for state" or "Replace burned out light bulb"?>><br><br>Good questions.  In each of these cases, I would break these 'Projects' into two or more Tasks:<br><br>1a: Write – enter tax info into TurboTax (or, in simpler times, fill out tax forms).<br>1b: Contact IRS – submit tax return.<br><br>2a: Contact X|Y|Z to collect samples at U|V|W).<br>2b: Arrange water samples.<br>2c: Learn – analyze water-sample data.<br>2d: Write water-sample report and summary table.<br>2e: Contact state water authority – send report and sample vials.<br><br>3a: Buy light bulb.<br>3b: Clean – replace burned-out bulb.<br><br><br>In each case, there are a limited set of things I can actually do, and 'Do' is too generic of an action verb, IMO.  If my work & life were less cerebral and more physical, I might have additional verbs such as Build, Gather, Haul, etc.  And I'm not committed to my current set of verbs or limiting them only to seven.  It's just a fun mental exercise for the most part.  Because I'm using a stack of index cards (one task per card) currently, it's interesting to sort the cards alphabetically to see how many of each type of task I have in the stack.  <br><br>As Zack rightly noted above, my verbs are functioning as tags, although I didn't think of it that way at first.  I'll admit it's a bit stilted. I'm using "Clean [up] ..." as a fairly generic tag for most household chores, and "Play ..." as a generic tag for most fun non-work-related activities.</div>

<div class="content">@ Hugo Ferreira<br><br>I feel the same way - that the <verb> <subject> construction is too limiting and non-conducive to the "little" part of "little and often."  I tried simply stating the <subject> as Mark does and ran into the problem of my brainstorming proclivity that I mentioned in my original post in this thread.  If I were to state “Sliding Banners” then my little and often actions that I came up with in the moment would eventually begin to wander away from my original intent.  For example, in researching plug-ins I may learn of another use for plug-ins on my site than sliding banners.  I’d research that and learn that this other use of plug-ins works best with websites with a certain directory hierarchy – which I would then research etc, etc, etc.  Before I know it “Sliding Banners” has become “Completely Overhauled Website.” <br><br>Maybe that’s what I actually wanted – a redesigned website, and the above methodology would get me there.  The problem I ran into wasn’t the wandering itself, but the fact that it never stopped.  “Completely Overhauled Website” became “All New Marketing Strategy” became “Start a New Business” (that’s more conducive to the marketing techniques I’ve learned) etc. etc. etc…  In the long haul, I find that such wandering tasks tend to grow beyond the scope of my current capability.  (ie: I don’t have time to work a list full of tasks that grow both vertically and horizontally without end.)<br><br>I have found that putting a tad bit more on the <subject> would paint a picture of a desired end state.  For example:  “Sliding Banners on my Site.”  This simple mental image does a few things for me.   First, it does not dictate the steps I am to take to achieve it, thereby affording me the freedom to choose what to do in the moment (same as stating only the <subject>).  Second, it provides loose boundaries to my in-the-moment action choices (as soon as I find myself researching something that does not put sliding banners on my site, I’d know I’d gone too far).  And third, it put a cap on the task such that it would not continue forever (when I could look at my site and see sliding banners on it – I’d cross off the task.)<br><br>Now this would only be helpful to those of you who (like me) have trouble keeping the reins on their meandering thoughts.  If I could simplify it further as Mark does, state only a single reminder and trust that my mind would not run away with it, then I would.  Honestly, it sounds really calming and peaceful to me, just to imagine being able to do it that way.  So more power to Mark for being able to.  I’m jealous.  Unfortunately, try though I may (and I have for more than 2 decades) I cannot keep my mind from meandering unless I state my desired intent up front as such.</div>

<div class="content">Hello, <br><br>I have had difficulty with this in the past as well.  I have found all systems like with GTD, AF,SF and generallly any task system to become complicated when you approach a task but don't really know what you mean by it because of its structure. Or what you meant by it when you wrote it a while back. because you forgot. I've tried several methods, like the verb action first (call, email, write, print, go, visit etc.), and even omitting the verb all together and just leaving trigger words to remind you. Such as Call John re : reports or the vague: John reports. Either the  verb method required too much thought and structure  for my laziness, or the vagueness of it frustrated me when I slowed down on my list trying to figure out what I wanted to do.. <br><br>Two problems:<br><br>verbs- too many verbs to choose . How do I know what I really need to do?  do I need to call or contact? email or fax? go to or drive?  Its not a major problem  (since thats what makes the language cool) but when you're trying to make sense of a task list it becomes a hassle unnecessarily.<br><br>trigger words/memory jogging words- they are like tags, big mess if not thought through. also, I'm not a fortune teller. How do I know my future self will will understand this reminder and get going?<br><br>What I have realized always works for me is to structure the sentence with GET____(fill in blank)______. as simple and silly as it seems it always relieves stress on my to do lists.<br><br>But do not put the "GET" part.  what you fill in the blank is outcome oriented and keeps me focused on what I really want to achieve/complete/get done/conquer/finish etc.. It also allows me to realize quickly if I'm putting nonsense on my list or not, by asking myself  "Is that what I really want to get done?"/ why? <br><br>examples---<br>instead of: "buy groceries" I'll put "groceries" ...I know to GET groceries. It is done if and only if the groceries were "got". Otherwise, I re-enter it like FV Says to.<br><br>instead of:<br>call john<br>find books<br>pay phone bill<br>feed fish<br>workout<br>email sandra<br>watch TV<br>buy light bulb<br>clean house<br><br>I'll put:<br><br>follow up from John about due date <br>books found<br>phone bill paid<br>fish fed<br>a meaningful workout<br>a checkup on sandra to see how she is<br>TV watched<br>light bulb bought <br>house cleaned<br><br>The second list, is goal oriented, and puts your  mind in an on/off or yes/no or done/undone mode. That's what I want! quick decision, focus and clarity.<br><br>The list may seem unordinary at first but as you use this sturcture more often you see the benefits. Looking at the first task on the second list, this new structure gives purpose to why I'm calling John, and I know its done if and only if I got the follow upfrom John. Theres nothing ambiguous when I see it a month from now and it doesn't take effort to structure. the structure is simply "GET (said in my head)"____ _____ when writing. IHad I worded it "call John" like in the first list, a month later I may ask why? what was this about?<br><br>Also, the watch tv clearly stands out like a sore thumb. There is no real purpose to 'get TV Watched' If I  checked off "got TV Watched" It clearly wouldn't be an accomplishment (at least to me it wouldn't) What would I gain from an episode of Family Guy other than laughs?. If its a break I'm looking to put on my list, maybe I should replace it with a purposeful/meaningful break like "(get) a walk around the block" or "(get) a chapter of my novel read" or "(get) fifteen minutes of practice on piano". Don't eliminate breaks and fundoing things just make sure they are towards a bigger purpose.<br><br>What is also good about this structure, is when you want to break a task down, its simple. Just ask yourself:<br><br> ..."to get this done, what do I need to get done?" or something around those lines.<br><br>It sound simplistic until you actually try it. I figured this out through practice of brainstorming and using mandalcharts. You only need to break it down into necessary components. Try to eliminate the optional components<br><br>Example: To get a shed built (a project/ goal/ large task depending on how you look at it), it would appear in my list like:<br><br>-shed built <br><br>The shed's not built if the shed's not built. plain and simple. But I know I have to break this down since it makes the large task manageable and action based. So I'll ask "to get the shed build , I would have to get...?" aha!...<br><br>-wood bought<br>-nails bought<br>-knowledge on how to build shed<br>-brother in law called to see if he can help<br>-get plan drawn up<br><br>I could go on and on about what I need to get,, but I just want a few to get started, not overwhelmed.  It doesnt have to be a perfect plan. just a start. Most likely, I'll alter  the plans anyways, but at least I can get started and make it realistic and progressing.This workd with goals as well...example: to (get) fit <br><br>I need to (get) <br>-3 sets on arms done<br>-20 pushpups <br>-a jog around block<br>-8 glass water drank today<br><br>One more thing, I have found for FV this structure makes the chain/ladder preselection much easier. since I can make clearer decisions when asking the question "what do I want to do before x". In my head, I feel more focusedand and confident when preselecting because I really do have a sense of what I want to accomplish more , therefore, I know what I want do do before I do x.<br><br>Summary, if you are having difficulties structuring tasks, I really suggest you try writing your tasks this way for a bit. If you want to get something done, it makes sense to me to  stucture it: <br><br>(GET )__________ <br><br>where the "get" is omitted from your list but just to mentally job your memory on how to write these task and the blank is result oriented.<br><br>Benefits:<br><br>-easy to write now and no vagueness when read later<br>-easily identify unimportant/non urgent  tasks (don't fool yourself by putting watch tv as a task), <br>-result oriented tasks motivate you, <br>-clear sense of progress (i.e. shed built...shed is either built or isn't), <br>-easier to break tasks down, task lists are not bogged with nonsense tasks you dont understand, lists become shorter, <br>-lists become more manageable, you can still put fun tasks but meaningful ones (swap "tv watched" with "practice piano"), <br>-no guiilt in not doing a task exactly how its written/specific contexts (who cares if I called sandra or emailed her,  or if i did it at work or home? <br>-as long as I achieved my purpose...to see how she's doing), <br>-you gain speed in the system because you stop less to ask why? or what is this task?<br><br>etc.<br><br>Hope this help others. Give it a try.</div>

But this is the GET Everything Done website, after all.  ;-]<br><br>Seriously, this is interesting.  I might just try it.  My only reservation is that the outcome-based formulation, in passive voice, really focuses on finishing (or rather, getting things finished).

<div class="content">That's a great idea ubi!  <br><br>IMHO, the crux of "The Question" is WANT and BEFORE.  I think Mark means those two to be the key words in the question since they focus your answer on things that you are psychologically ready for (ie: "want") in a rough order of precedence (ie: "before").  That seems to be the whole point of the question.<br><br>Given that both of those elements are the same, I don't see how changing "do" to "get" would harm anything.<br><br>I'm going to give it a go right away.</div>

<div class="content">I'm liking it already. Since I'm using index cards (one per task), I can rewrite the description GET-style on a lower line of each card (with an arrow -> to distinguish the rewording as I transition to the new method). And I've already realized that passive voice might not be needed much. Two examples:<br><br>"Learn - try AlgorithmX on DataY" <br>-> "TCR improvement on DataY - try AlgorithmX"<br><br>"Contact Mr.Z 123-456-7890 at optometrist" <br>-> "Glasses insert - Mr.Z 123-456-7890"<br><br>At least for these two examples, I had no need to reword into the passive voice. What I want to GET are the TCR improvement and the glasses insert. "Learn" and "Contact" seem superfluous all of a sudden...</div>

<div class="content">I'll just repeat what I said earlier about keeping the overhead in FV to the absolute minimum. The system is supposed to be one which requires as little mental effort as possible to operate. All your suggestions seem to me to be adding overhead. And I'll also repeat the other thing I said earlier - I don't believe any improvement from using a different way of phrasing tasks will be anything other than temporary.<br><br>My advice: stop fiddling with the system and use it to get some real work done.</div>

In the end, that's all that<br>matters.<br><br> It's almost as if all your tasks are on the same bases but project<br>themselves appropriately and differently.<br><br>I think 'get' is one of those special words that can replace all my<br>previous frustrations with verbs./trigger words for next action.<br>Previously, by assuming a verb before doing the task I would<br>unnecessarily attract complications to my task list.<br><br>@ubi<br><br>The little and often still applies. Nothing is changing except the way<br>you construct your task. This is simply so that your "future" self<br>knows what the task means. By using a template, there's no ambiguity<br>about the task.<br><br>Example:<br>Fish fed<br>Family guy watched<br>John called<br>Shed built<br>Moonlight sonata perfected<br><br>These are all tasks regardless if I word them one way or another. But<br>by wording them in the (get) _________structure I get focus and<br>clarity.  Therefore , a lot less resistance.<br><br>Either I got the fish fed or I didn't.  If I did, cross it off and add<br>to end of list so they don't die.<br><br>Either I got John called or I didn't. If I did, it's deleted. If not,<br>it remains on my list in FV fashion.<br><br>Either the shed is built or not. if not, I can break it down and add<br>to end of list. I don't have do it all in one shot. I can still do the<br>little and often.<br><br>Either I got moonlight sonata perfected or I don't.  If not, then<br>little and often practice. If its perfected, i achieved my goal and I<br>can showoff.<br><br>I admit, the wording seems grammatically incorrect at times or<br>awkward. But it quickly becomes very fluent and fast for the present<br>and future you.  And as you can see, it can be applied to one-off<br>tasks, recurring task , projects or goals.<br><br>I put 'family guy watched' on purpose, because I'm certain before you<br>got to this point you probably realized that this task is popping out<br>as not necessary. (maybe not) My point is, I can remove this from my<br>list because it won't push me towards anything meaningful. If my list<br>is long already , I don't want it to be sinking with tasks that<br>sacrifice my time towards bigger and better things.  I like to take<br>advantage of my bad memory and forgetting I even put that task there.<br>That way, I'll more likely do something meaningful in the future.<br><br>>>Summary, do FV as normal to the 'T'. But, consider structuring your tasks in a way you can understand it. Don't put jibberish you won't understand on your task list only to get confused and resist later</div>

<div class="content">@Mark Forster<br><br>My intentions are not to fiddle with your system at all. I think FV is perfect the way it is. I simply wanted to share my ‘Task phraseology’ as I realized it is a trending problem amongst others. <br><br>In fact after reading your FV instructions, one of my first tasks were “2 weeks of non-tweaking”. It has been crossed and re-entered a few times. And I believe I developed the habit of not needing to tweak at all. Soon it will be crossed for good. :)<br><br>I’m glad you’re giving it a try, but again, this phrasing works perfectly for me and may not at all work for you or others.<br><br>I have noticed on another  thread, that you generally don’t understand the issue with phrasing. Which is probably because what has been working for you works for you very well. However, taking your sample list :<br><br>Farm in Queensland?<br>How support A's fund?<br>Fund Raising ideas?<br>What's happened to Bill P?<br>Parrot with yellow head and red underbelly?<br>Random timer?<br>Voip?<br>Monte Cristo sequels?<br>Universal capture?<br>600th Meeting?<br>Deadline for magazine?<br>Blog subjects?<br>Priority actions as VP?<br><br>I understand what these say and all that, but when I’m working the list, my mind see questions, so I think “answer this”. I think this form is sort of doing the same thing as I do. Except here I think you are simply subconciously phrasing the list as:<br> <br>(consider)____________.  <br><br>On the other hand, if the question marks are all removed, (my mind) sees a bigger mess. It sees a conglomerate of tags/trigger words and therefore I have to connect the dots before completing something.  <br><br>Maybe I’m not explainging myself clearly with the problems I see on this list, but for some they may understand me a bit.<br><br>Suppose I come accross ‘Voip? ‘<br><br> If I’m in task mode, I now have to stop and think... ‘ voip...what about voip? /what do i need to consider about this?/ what action / decision is to be taken? /sign up for voip? or was it the ad i saw about the voip price rates?..etc.  <br><br>This is a not so good example because, your list is your list and I simply don’t know your initial reason for ‘voip’ to pop in your head.  But, if I were to just structure it a bit result oriented to begin with like “signed up with new voip plan” or “ signed up with voip to save money” I would have significantly less questions and my task mode would continue to flow.<br><br>One of my tasks, on my list were “post up on task phrasing”. Which I (got). Had I put something in trigger word form like : “task phrasing post?” or “FV task phrase post” I would probably be hemming and hawing/ doing unnecessary thought and cycling through unneccessary thought before completing.<br><br>Anyways, for me at least, I do not consider any mental overhead at all. Using this natural template/structure significantly reduces my mental effort when writing tasks and when doing it.  It allows me to still rapidly capture something to get done. Again, it seems too simple in theory and sometimes grammatically incorrect but through practice I’ve found it to be great. In the end its all just words put together, so it doesnt matter. What does matter, is the doing part and allocating of time to what you are doing.<br><br>I’m not encouraging others to deviate/fiddle (in any way) with FV, but I encourage those with phrase problems to consider the structure and at least test your assumptions about it. Maybe something like “significant testing on structure” and/or “conclusion about structure” could exist on your list.  If your conclusion is : works great, then use it. Otherwise don’t.</div>

<div class="content">@ubi<br><br>["Learn" and "Contact" seem superfluous all of a sudden...]<br><br>I can see you're getting the hang of it really well because I 'see' the same thing. :) For some reason it has stuck with me over the years (and probably you too)  that action oriented must equate to 'verb in sentence somehow'. But by using the (get)______ you achieve the same thing without anchored to specific (possible incorrect/unnecessary) verbs which imply a specific method. <br><br>The only thing, I find the rephrasing of past tasks to be tedious work.

<div class="content">GMBW:<br><br>As I said in my previous post I am testing out your phrasing method to see whether I find it makes a difference. It's too early to report back on that.<br><br>The sample list you quote was specifically directed at unformed and vague thoughts. I'm not quite sure how you would phrase them in a way which a) reduces mental overhead and b) produces additional clarity. <br><br>Of course you don't understand what most of them mean - but the point is I do, and so would you if it were your list. <br><br>I simply don't see why you need the additional information "“Signed up with new voip plan”. In fact with a query after the task, you would need to phrase it "Considered whether to sign up with new Voip plan". I can't see that it adds anything to the task, since Voip? is quite clear in my mind as to what the task description means - even though it isn't a real task, just one which I'd made up for the example. <br><br>I don't have to think about what it means, or any of the others either. I know what they mean. The extra words add nothing. At most I'd  put "New Voip Plan?"<br><br>(In fact the task meant "What do the initials Voip stand for?"

<div class="content">Mark Forster:<br><br>I was going to talk about mindmapping in a previous post but I thought it would just make my post too long and all over the place. I have a lot of experience mindmapping. I like it a lot as well. It is true that  less words increase clarity. But this is true only on a mindmap.<br><br>Mindmaps and task lists are clearly different things. The reason single words work on a mindmap is for many reasons because you can see the big picture, the connections are made visually through branches, also you can add pictures (worth a thousand words) to any branch. Further, Tony Buzan makes a distinction in branch lengths, and curvilinear branches to influence creativity and relativity between nodes. Indeed, they are great to flesh out thoughts and creativity. On a task list, it simply doesnt work. <br><br>Here is a video I'm sure you've seen before:  <br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlabrWv25qQ" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlabrWv25qQ</a> <br><br>at the 1:20 mark he explains what I'm trying to say properly. What you are saying,  is at 2:35. I understand you fully.<br><br>But, you just can not get these things on a rigid list. Thats why the extra words are necessary to take care of those connections and visuals (focused or big picture) missing from your list.<br><br>I agree that less words increase clarity, but this is true on a map. Not so much on a list. That is not to say each task should be 20 words long. Thats just rediculous. The task should be written with 'enough' words to just understand later on. Whatever you're comfortable with.<br><br>My list isn't being entered in a writing contest. So I make sure I don't go overboard with it. I just don't want to forget something and at the same time I want to understand my reminder. I accomplish this with as few words as possible each time.</div>

<div class="content">Regarding the vagueness of a task description such as<br><br>VoIP?<br><br>I was intrigued earlier that Mark said the only types of notes he takes at meetings are action items and utterances he's suspicious of.  (I think that's the gist of it, but I'm too lazy this early a.m. to scan back through the threads.)  The latter also imply action items, e.g. <br><br>[Get] Utterance X by Mr. Y at Mtg. Z debunked<br><br>I often take notes at meetings, to keep myself from getting bored and to look engaged, while also trying to control my natural inclination to interrupt often.  A lot of these notes are more like summary minutes of the meeting, and thus quite boring to review later.  Perhaps I should try more eye contact and thoughtful listening. . .<br><br>The reason the 'VoIP?' task connected me to the earlier comment about meeting notes is that I have found that a valuable technique for becoming a "member of the club" – on a project or in a social circle that is new to you – is to compile your own list of abbreviations, initialisms, and acronyms (LoAIA [which is a HETLA]) and learn how to use them with those folks. When I'm in a meeting where a bunch of these are used, I will add them to my notes as, e.g.<br><br>VoIP = ___________<br><br>to make it clear I'm looking for the expansion of the acronym.  Or I might write<br><br>VoIP = ________ Internet Protocol (?)<br><br>if I can guess part of it.

Now, I will say that if, at the same time, I have multiple items related to the shed, it makes sense to clarify in as few words as possible (e.g. "shed built" or "shed cleaned"), but it would seem that the usual case of tasks involving the same item will be progressive in nature and, therefore, "shed" should suffice just once in the list.

<div class="content">I think getting stuck on a specific structure and vowing to stick with it forever is counter-productive. So is saying none are needed.<br><br>Experiment for a few days with each structure. Chances are it will waste time for many tasks, but work wonders for some of them -- on the whole, saving more time than is wasted. I spent a few weeks years ago defining next actions and contexts for every project. Now I know that when a task squirms away from me, those are the tools to use. They're in my toolbox, right at hand, and they're comfortable. I can use them quickly. When a project starts growing, I know to define done. When it feels fuzzy or I feel guilty spending time it, I think about how it fits into my future reality, and if a different project would do the job better.<br><br>Eventually, your toolbox will have a wide variety of tools, and you'll be adept at picking the right one for the job. The only way to get a good toolbox is to use a wide variety of tools, and use them until you know what they're good for and how to use them efficiently.<br><br>I like the Get terminology. I don't feel the need for it now, but my son does. (Note to self: Horse, water.)<br><br>Right now, I'm focusing on "just do what you feel like". I've always assumed "little" meant a clearly-defined chunk, like reading one chapter or tidying an entire room. I've always worried about stopping a task before I've gotten into it. With FV, by the time I start a task I'm already into it, so that fear is reduced. I'm more able to stat a larger task when time is limited, or drop it and move on to something I'll be more effective at at the moment.<br><br>Will I stay with that, or go back to defined chunks? I don't know. I do know that even if I go back, I'll be more open to stopping a partly-done chunk, or doing more than one chunk, or 1.5 chunks, than I was before. That's a good tool to have in the box, even if I don't need it every day.</div>

<div class="content">One of the things I love about Mark’s system and FV in particular is the low overhead.  I hated the weekly review of GTD. I have been using the FV without tweaking since it came out with wonderful results. <br><br>After reading this thread I scanned my list and I don’t have any particular way I write a task…sometimes it has details like a phone number sometimes it has action verbs and some times just a single word. The wording of a task doesn’t seem to make a difference in my being productive; I don’t ever seem have a problem with wondering what I should do next. I have much less resistance to completing tough tasks using the FV rule “What do I want to do before X”. In addition without even thinking about it, it has helped me better plan my workload.<br><br>One thing I did stop doing was using my task list to do anything other than list my tasks. No more tracking of projects, calculating my churn rate, using it for documentation or notes that I completed a task on a specific date. My task list is only for making sure I get everything done. <br><br>I have also found out that by using FV, I am completing my projects (investigation reports) much faster. I write the project in my list with no next actions. Just one or two words – “Validation Survey”. When I get to that task, I pull out the file and using single sheet of paper or sticky; list what needs to be done. Using the FV method, I preselect tasks and start working. Some of these reports only take an hour to complete, but others take upward of 10-15 hours. If I don’t finish the report, I don’t even have to make a note where I left off. My list is there and I know exactly what my next action is. I just rewrite the task in my FV list “Validation Survey”. <br><br>So simple. Thanks Mark!<br><br><br>Jennifer</div>

I’d just put build sheds!  <br><br>Similarly, ‘clean house’---> living room cleaned, kitchen cleaned, carpets vacuumed, dishes washed. are all concrete tasks with endpoints that took literally no mental overhead for me to write.

<div class="content">I like to spell out the steps I can take on the shed in the near future, but not to an extreme. If I just see "shed", I might think of the hard lifting, and not remember I also need to look at plans on the internet (definitely a want, and easy to do on a rainy weekend) or research building permits (good to know if there are any funnies before starting to dig).<br><br>On the other hand, spelling out all the steps too soon isn't necessary. I don't need to list all the catalogs I might check -- but I do want to remember the one a friend recommended.</div>

<div class="content">It may also make a difference how often you are getting through the list. If you are getting through several times a day, you should be refreshing your memory at each pass, so the phrasing may not matter. If not, you may well have a few "what on Earth did I mean by that?" moments.</div>

<div class="content">@ Mark,<br><br>I too agree in not adding overhead.  You should write as much as you need and no more.  You stated it precisely when you said:<br><br>"Voip? is quite clear in my mind as to what the task description means"<br><br>My problem is that “VOIP?” would not be clear in my mind as to what the task calls for – even had I been the originator of the task in the first place.  This lack of clarity would generally lead me to run with the task much further than I originally intended to, or to resist it mercilessly.  Magnify this effect across every task on my list, and I’d have a list that uncontrollably expands to utterly unmanageable proportions due to infinitely recursive tasks.  Others here (including you Mark) seem don’t seem to have this problem.  You seem perfectly capable of heading in the direction you intended with only a loose reminder of what direction you originally intended.  More power to you.  I however, need my reminders to be a little more concrete to obtain the same mental control that you have without the additional definition.<br><br>The simplest statement that would state it clearly enough for me to put a cap on my run-away mental processor would be “VOIP acronym understood.”  This way I can decide in the moment what I must do (or “get”) in order to complete the task, I know when I have finished the task, and I know when I have wandered off task.  Magnify that effect across my whole list, and I have something much more manageable – something more akin to how you intended FV to run.<br><br>So I already use the simplest method of phrasing tasks I can, to make the scope of the task clear in my mind – just as you suggest I do.  Additionally, after years of thinking of my tasks this way, it truly IS how tasks “pop into my head.”  So for it to pop into my head as “VOIP acronym understood,” and then to simplify the phrasing down to “VOIP?” and later to decode what I meant by “VOIP?” WOULD constitute additional overhead FOR ME.  Which is why I will not do it that way.<br><br>For you, if “VOIP?” suffices to clearly capture the task you had in mind (and I know it does), then I’d recommend you relieve yourself of the hassle of testing out our methodology.  I don’t propose that one methodology works better than another, just that mine works best for me, and I’ve elaborated as to why it works best for me (since I’ve given it a ton of thought and experimentation).  <br><br>My excitement over the “Get” phrasing comes from a different quarter.  In three comments on (<a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/fv-forum/post/1777175)" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/fv-forum/post/1777175)</a> I breathlessly articulate a comparatively mentally laborious process I work through every time I “work the task for as long as I like” per your FV rules.  While it may seem a complicated process when described conceptually, in practice it can become second nature – as it has for me over nearly a year of practice.  I found that this mental process helped me immensely in the battle to keep my wandering and distracted mind on the task at hand.  It has worked very, very well for me.  But GMBW’s suggested method of breaking down tasks by asking yourself what ELSE you need to “get” in order to complete the task of “getting something done” accomplishes the same thing that my current mental exercise accomplishes – with LESS mental overhead.  <br><br>That’s what got me so excited.  It’s more mentally ergonomic than what I already use.  It’s even less mental overhead.  It’s simpler.  Exactly what you suggest – the less overhead the better.  Awesome.  I’m sold.<br><br>Finally, I don’t feel that any of the above (for me personally) constitutes “fiddling with the system” but rather “fiddling with the way I think.”  (which incidentally, sounds much better than “fiddling with myself…”  Did I just type that out loud?)<br><br>To close – I do like your suggestion to use the system to get some real work done.  (*adds “real work done” to FV list* ;-)  I actually told myself a couple days ago that I’ve spent too much time in this forum and that I SHOULD get back to focusing on more “important” things on my FV list.  But I didn’t FEEL like it, so I hung around a little longer.  Then came GMBW’s post about the whole “get” thing.  Glad I listened to my intuition.  Now I feel like I caught the whopper that I fished for with my original post, and so my intuition tells me I’m done with posting for now.  Time to “get” back to work.<br><br>So adieu for now.  I’m off to chase the rest of my FV list “get” style.</div>

<div class="content">I've been watching this thread and to me, it all boils down to -<br><br>>I just don't want to forget something and at the same time I want to understand my reminder. I accomplish this with as few words as possible each time.<<br><br>How everyone gets to that point - "Shed" vs "Paint Shed" vs "fix sticky shed on the weaving loom" vs some other shed related tasks - sounds like personal preference based on where/how the tasks are kept (I tend to write more cryptic notes when I'm doing it electronically, no idea why) vs keeping as many details with the task vs action verbs etc <br><br>As long as the task descriptions are meaningful for the person *doing* the task, does it really matter if anyone else does it the same way?

Similar to 'bladder emptied' or "iron turned off" to be put on my list.  if it wasn't meant to be funny, disregard  what I said. And you'll notice it will be crossed off anyways very quickly if you indeed have a headache.  <br><br>Though, I would put 'aspirin purchased'. Even better,  just 'aspirin'.  Either way you have  to get it. Maybe your coworker has some and you don't need to purchase  it.

<div class="content">I don't remember which thread it was in, but IIRC the "VOIP?" task came up in an example of being in a meeting and VOIP was used as an unknown abbreviation. The task is to figure out what VOIP means. (I assume that for whatever reason, just asking when it came up in conversation wasn't appropriate for the situation, at least for purposes of the example)</div>

<div class="content">@seraphim<br><br><<shed>><br><br>I understand your iterations on building the shed. My concern with this type of phrasing is the breakdown each pass. Some of the tasks are optional and not critical to the end result...the shed built. <br><br>By starting with the end result. Then breaking it into incremental components critical to achieving the bigger result, I know that there is a reason for everything on my list. <br><br>Example:  <br>Shed discuss with wife:<br>discuss what with wife? What do I need to get out of this discussion? I don't know so we may end up discussing unnecessarily stuff about shed for a long time.  This is why meetings usually have a purpose at work. <br><br>Shed- check prices<br>if I have google handy, or a set of catalogs, where do I draw the line? what's the end result? I need one in order to move to the next thing. you may say check prices until it feels like you checked enough. ...ok so do I cross it off, or re enter it to check a bit more? On the other hand if I just wrote "lowest price from x, y and z" , or something similar I would be confident in knowing when it's done or not. <br><br>Shed- can NNN build one?<br><br>"Yes or no from NNN to build shed"<br><br>Etc. most of these questions probably wouldn't creep in on your list if you simply wrote "shed built" and broke it down asking "to get shed built, I need to get"... the necessary components would show up and you'd quickly understand what needs to get done and what doesn't. <br><br>Also, I'm not big on multiple lists and moving from list to list. I like one long list on which I can see what needs to be removed to/ changed. with Important/ urgent things popping out when I want them too. </div>

<div class="content">@ lilian. <br>:) of course her input is very important. I was making a point that there isn't a target to the discussion. So discuss the shed may end up as just a long discussion/argument with no purpose.  <br>When your co worker asks for a meeting there is generally a target or purpose. It's not just discuss reports. It's probably "(get) Summary of progress" similarly discuss shed with wife is probably "yes/ not on shed" , " sweeties thoughts incorporated in plan" etc.</div>
