<div class="content">What is the simplest, fastest way to produce a randomized preselected list for FVP? <br><br>In other words, how can one dot tasks from one end of the list to the other, randomly, rapidly, and limitedly—producing a small preselected list that is then acted upon according to the standard FVP rules?</div>

<div class="content">Why would you want to?<br><br>Here's an easy way.  Choose the first task, then roll a 20-sided die to choose the next one, repeating till you get to the end of the list.   But I have a feeling this will create resistance, not reduce it.</div>

<div class="content">Another way, of course, could just be to switch to the Randomizer method from time to time.</div>

<div class="content">What I'm currently experimenting with:<br><br>For random numbers I'm using a free app called "Randomness": https://appsto.re/us/cfP7x.i<br><br>These are the rules I'm following:<br><br>1. Dot the first task on the list.<br>2. Generate a random number (set between 1 and the number of active pages).<br>3. Using the random number, count forward through the list that number of pages.<br>4. When you arrive at your random page, dot the first active task on the page. Alternatively, dot the tasks that stand out.<br>5. Continue generating random numbers, moving forward through the list that number of pages, and dotting tasks.<br>6. When the random number takes you to the end of the list, or past it, your preselection is complete.<br>7. Do the tasks in reverse order and use the standard FVP rules.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br>"Why would you want to?"<br><br>I've developed a significant resistance to the initial preselection process. Question or no question, my resistance is high and I feel fatigued, overwhelmed, numb to the tasks, and indecisive as to what stands out. This became true for me with most of the scan-based systems, including: FV, AF4, AF4 Revised, UTMS?, and UTMS Improved?. With a short list it likely wouldn't be an issue, but I never have a short list. I've tried going slower, faster, skimming, using my pen as a pointer, and simply jumping to the sections I know are likely to have tasks that stand out (typically the last 5-7 pages). <br><br>It occurred to me to try randomization with FVP, as my resistance drops to zero when I use that method, yet the FVP algorithm of scanning to the end of the list from your last task is perfect—and that scan is typically short and I feel enthusiastic about doing it for some reason.</div>

But I have a feeling this will create resistance, not reduce it."<br><br>I tried that first before writing this post (it's why I wrote this post) and as you say, it created resistance. It also produced a lot of dotted tasks and took a long time to do.</div>

<div class="content">Hm, originally I was going to say, divide number of open pages by 5 and round to nearest integer.  This gives you N.  Then select first task on page 1, and first task on every subsequent Nth page.  Example:  16 pages => N=3 => select first task on page 1, 6, 11, and 16.<br><br>But maybe it would be better just to switch to the standard Randomizer method.  This could help clear out extra pages that are nearly done.  Randomizer is really good at that.  This would reduce the page-flipping and perhaps reduce resistance if/when you return to FVP.<br><br>I am really intrigued by the fact that FVP IS "zero resistance" for some, like Mark and myself, and "high resistance" for others, like Nuntym and yourself.  I wonder what could be the deciding factor.</div>

<div class="content">Another way to randomize that occurs to me is this:<br><br>1. Dot the first active task on the list.<br>2. Using the number of *completed tasks* on that page, move forward through the list that number of active pages.<br>3. When you arrive at your random page, dot the first active task on the page. Alternatively, dot any tasks that stand out on the page.<br>4. Continue your preselection using the number of completed tasks on your current random page to move forward through the list that number of active pages and dot tasks according to rule 3.<br>5. When the random number takes you to the last page, or past it, your preselection is complete.<br>6. Do the tasks in reverse order and use the standard FVP rules.</div>

<div class="content">Michael B.<br><br><< I've developed a significant resistance to the initial preselection process. >> <br><br>I'm not sure what you mean by the "initial preselection process". When you start doing FVP you do an initial preselection, but that never happens again. FVP does not work like FV. <br><br><< Question or no question, my resistance is high and I feel fatigued, overwhelmed, numb to the tasks, and indecisive as to what stands out. >><br><br>It sounds as if you are trying to force the process. You should not be *trying* to find tasks that stand out. You should be dotting tasks that *do* stand out. If you are indecisive as to what stands out, that's because nothing is standing out.<br><br>You don't have to dot any tasks at all when scanning. If nothing stands out, then that's because the first task on the list is the next task to do.<br><br><< yet the FVP algorithm of scanning to the end of the list from your last task is perfect—and that scan is typically short and I feel enthusiastic about doing it for some reason. >><br><br>That's all FVP ever consists of. There is nothing else.<br><br>Also see my post yesterday on the "An observation" thread in which I say that if you find that the first few tasks on your list are a bunch of difficult tasks which you are resisting then you are doing FVP wrong.</div>

But at the end of the day if someone can't make a system work for them, then the best thing to do is to accept it's not for them.</div>

<div class="content">Michael B. , in the "task count" post, you say your list is made of : <br>227 Tasks<br>28 Pages<br><br>I could not bear such a long list ! Mine is 48 tasks long, and I feel overwhelmed; I always try to keep it under 30 tasks. <br><br>I can only speak according to how I react to such a situation of course, but I imagine that with such a long list as you have, I would resist at it completely. <br><br>In this situation, I would either :<br>- scan the whole list and select only vital / important / urgent stuff, and put it on a fresh new list, and put the rest in a backlog.<br>- declare the whole list as a backlog, and start a new list.<br><br>Then work the backlog within the list, as Mark has described many times. <br><br>My resistance level is much lower when working a short list than rather than working a long list.<br>I found that just admitting that I cannot deal with all that stuff is quite a relief. Knowing that some of this backlog will fade away because it will not be relevant anymore in some time, is a source of motivation to me, and the new list gets worked on much better.</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br>Your reply illuminated some of the issues for me. I also read the reply you wrote for the "An observation" thread. Solid insight. I'm going to adjust my process according to what you've written and carry on confidently.</div>

<div class="content">Michael B.  , I hope the backlog declaration will help you. <br><br>Everybody have their own limits, and it is good to know how to detect when overcommitment has been reached. <br>as I try to keep things simple, I set my limit by just the total tasks count of the list.</div>
