<div class="content">hi all,<br><br>I have some (probably stupid) questions on Implementation of FVP.<br><br>1.  Is there a specific method that works well for moving through all pages in your task list?  In other words, when do you move from page 1 to page 2, etc.?<br>2.  Does anyone have specific recommendations on notebooks?<br><br><br>Thanks,<br><br>David</div>

The pages in your notebook are irrelevant to the operation of the system.<br><br><< Does anyone have specific recommendations on notebooks? >><br><br>If you search for "Notebooks" in the search box in the right-hand margin you will find plenty of recommendations from readers of this blog over the years.<br><br>Any lined notebook will do (or even an unlined one if you're not worried by a slight unevenness). Your main consideration would be how portable you want it to be. Otherwise it wants to be big enough so you have to do a minimum of page shuffling. You can usually get more than one column on a page if you want.<br><br><< How did you handle backlog when starting FVP? >><br><br>It depends what sort of backlog you mean. If it's a backlog of email, paper, etc, then put it all in a folder named "[Email] Backlog" and start afresh with new email etc coming in. Put both Email and Email Backlog (etc) as tasks on your list, so you can be working on both clearing new stuff and the backlog without the one getting in the way of the other.<br><br>If it's a backlog of projects then arrange them in the order you want to deal with them and introduce them into your list a few at a time.<br><br>Remember backlogs are a sign of either two much work or inefficient systems or both, so you also need to do remedial work on reducing your workload and improving your systems.</div>
