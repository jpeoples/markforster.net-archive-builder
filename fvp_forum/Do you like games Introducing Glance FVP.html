<div class="content">I don't know about you guys, but I LOVE games. Mark Forster's hints of a new iteration of FVP that involves no lists and JulieBulie's post in the same thread gave me an inspiration to think of this variant which tries to make a game out of not looking at one's FV list.<br><br>Needed: notebook, pen, Post-Its, paper clip<br>1. Write the first unactioned item on a Post-It, cross the task out from the notebook, and stick it on the front of the notebook.<br>2. Take time now to glance at the list and even weed it.<br>3. Use the paperclip on the notebook such that only the end of the list is visible when you open the notebook. <br>4. Now close your notebook and tell yourself to not open it, except the end of the list when you have to add new tasks (and even then try not to look at those tasksat the end), until you have done the task in the Post-It. You can, of course, do other tasks you want to do before the said task.<br>5. Once you have done the task, remove the paperclip then go back to step 1.<br><br>I'm gonna try this when I get home :)</div>

<div class="content">@JulieBulie:<br><br>Sorry I never did update this thread. Unfortunately the trial lasted only a few hours. Though the first few times were OK, the thing just produced too much anxiety to be worth it for me. <br><br>Plain vanilla FVP is much better. However, I like "No List" FVP even more :)</div>

<div class="content">I had the same experience. If it's a no-resistance task, then the game isn't necessary. If it's a high-resistance task, the game doesn't really help.<br><br>It sounded good, though!</div>
