Instead, that task has the potential to become the most exciting one if you happen to catch yourself at a time when that judgement has been neutralized, albeit temporarily.</div>

<div class="content">@Frank:<br><br>"I believe the author is saying that if you are able to ignore/discount the (negative) judgement aspect that you've introduced to a task, you can then access what the initial true excitement level of the task originally was."<br><br>Ah, if you put it that way that makes sense, thank you, and I actually believe in that too.  All the talk about vibrations and higher self just made everything hard to read for me.<br><br>The question then is how to remove that "negativity" from a task, which is actually simple in traditional Christianity.  Traditional Christianity's view on controlling one's emotions is that of making "wildlife reserves" in the heart: you let your emotions run wild in certain aspects of your life.  That way, your emotions remain healthy and strong, undiluted as it were, ready to be used on a moment's notice, while keeping them controlled and outside of aspects of your life where they are not needed.  <br><br>That is why the Bible said in multiple places: "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom." If you keep your fear roaring and wild when it comes to losing the Lord, it keeps itself outside of or at least manageable in other parts of your life.  If you keep at it, wisdom comes out, because fear ceases to cloud your judgment in other parts of your life.<br><br>This is the same reason why traditional Eastern Christianity says, "Anger is for the spirits", which is the same as Western Christianity's "Hate the sin, not the sinner."</div>

<div class="content">I take "exciting" to be a sign of the spiritual self wishing to move in that direction - "inner guidance" - as long as "exciting" means "appealing", "uplifting", "joyful", "vital", "lively", and is not adrenaline-fuelled emotional "arousing", "thrilling", or "risky". The spirit is embedded in the flesh, but so is the ego's need for safety and security.</div>

<div class="content">I am enjoying using "what's more exciting than x" question with my notebook/Evernote combo.<br><br>The mind is a kind of sophisticated idiot that will try to quickly process and answer any question put to it. Ask it "Why can I never get ahead?" and it will search its database to find an answer with supporting examples. Never mind that the question is ill-considered and detrimental; I asked it a question, it will provide an answer and not spare my feelings in the process.<br><br>Instead, asking "what's more exciting than x" puts the mind back on my side, I think. It's a more fun question to ask, really. My mind seems to find (maybe even create?) some frisson of excitement/energy/possibility lurking in even mundanely phrased tasks. The excitement may only be "how quickly can I get this done?" but any motivational energy is welcome.<br><br>"What do I want to do more than x" also works for selection but the energy that question evokes is subtler. (Subtler even than the "what stands out" AF question.) But the "what's more exciting" question assumes that first task is *already* exciting, and if my mind accepts that as a starting premise for the question, then it will search out excitement from the rest of my list. It's a great little mood-shifter, I think.</div>

<div class="content">I've been experimenting again!<br><br>This time I've been using FVP with no question at all. <br><br>This is how it works:<br><br>1) Dot the first task on the list, then scan through to the end of the list dotting any tasks that "stand out" on the way.<br><br>2) Work on the last dotted task. Cross it out when finished and re-enter if necessary.<br><br>3) Scan from the task which you have just crossed out to the end of the list, dotting any tasks that "stand out" on the way. <br><br>Repeat steps 2) and 3) ad infinitum.<br><br>Note that if no tasks "stand out" in step 3) the last dotted task will be located *before* the task you have just crossed out, not after it.<br><br>One big advantage of this method is that it is much faster to scan than when you are using a question.<br><br>I haven't been using it long enough to judge the quality of selection yet.</div>

<div class="content">You can speed it up much more by closing the list at something like 8 items (preferably things you are in a frame of mind to do and perhaps a couple you're not) and then doing FVP on only those 8 until theyre all done, THEN adding any re-entries back to your main list and selecting a new 8-item FVP list, repeat.  FVP is a bubble sorting algorithm which means the work involved increases as the square of the items.  Running FVP on a 180-item list (I think someone had) will be grossly inefficient compared to running it on a short list due to the sheer number of times an item is compared and has nothing happen to it.</div>

<div class="content">"1) Dot the first task on the list, then scan through to the end of the list dotting any tasks that "stand out" on the way."<br><br>I have worked the list in a similar way, but one problem is the list becomes very messing, and I am not sure of what to do each morning? Do I somehow dismiss the dots still on the list and start anew each day? Too messy? <br>Would using "darts" to mark the tasks, with the actual dot only being used on the current task work or be overly cumbersome? <br><br>I've used FVP more consistently than any system in awhile. I even changed the question with the "exciting" wording. But, after reading Mark's modification, I realized that I I often due this if I don't remember to ask the "question." This may be a system which works if I can figure out the logistics of dotting. (A messy list is a distraction for me personally.)</div>

<div class="content">I'm down with Standing Out over asking a question.  I find often I get pulled that way anyways.  Many of the items on the list just fail to stand out at a particular moment, and then it's hard to even answer the question.  Between 2 tasks I don't care about now, which do I kind-of-sort-of-care-for more?  Much easier to have bypassed both of them because neither stand out yet.<br><br>Chris: fine insight about Bubblesorting (though mechanically this is more efficient).  For me it hasn't been a problem because I'm keeping the list down to around 30 items.  Getting a short list of about 8 items is something I used to do, and I was happy with it, but for me this is better.</div>

<div class="content">Alan, you're right and worth noting that, unlike an unsorted list to be sorted, the size of the list changes (as items are done or new items are added) and that the correct order also changes (as something becomes differently appealing to how it was previously). However the bubble sort dynamic, and the n^2 dominance, remains.</div>

<div class="content">My list seems to have stabilized at about 55 items, which is lower than with other systems - where I have in the past got up to about 120.<br><br>I don't find I have any problem scanning with this. It's fast and effective, especially with the "no question" method. <br><br>I am as always using paper and pen. I can see though that with Andreas' web implementation a major effort is required in order to scan. I didn't pick that up initially because I tested his first version with a short artificial list of about 20 items. (I haven't tried any of his later versions).<br><br>I want to think a bit about why my list is remaining short. It's not through any conscious attempt to limit it, so the reason must lie within the system itself. <br><br><br>In the meantime a few suggestions/observations:<br><br>1) Have "Weed List" as a task.<br><br>2) I'm still inclining to my second thought that it's best not to re-prioritize the list, but instead to cross out and re-enter individual tasks that have significantly changed priority. I'm finding that works better, and if nothing else it saves making a mess of the dots!<br><br>3) I'm not sure that Chris's assertion that "FVP is a bubble sorting algorithm which means the work involved increases as the square of the items" is correct. It would be correct if the sort were on a closed list, but the list is not closed. The fact is that with an open list a long sort is a relatively rare event. Most of one's time is spent towards the end of the list and that being the case the length of the list is irrelevant most of the time. I'm not saying that it doesn't have an effect, just that it's not as pronounced as it would appear from what he says.</div>

<div class="meta">2015-06-4 13:29</div>
<div class="content">The easiest way to shorten the deep scan is to decide on the spot that you want to do a chosen task now, rather than continue scanning to the end. Effectively you would be pretending that "there is nothing else on the list I would want to do more than this."  After you complete "this" you of course continue scanning forward as the rules indicate you should. <br><br>Having said that, I agree with Mark's 1,2,3 and don't find any need to try such a tweak.</div>

<div class="content">Mathematically it is not the same as a closed list, such as n integers which will always contain quantity n and always be sorted in order through a number of operations until complete.  The FVP list size will change and the value of each item will change with each iteration according to The Question.<br><br>Spending more time near the end of the list does not lessen the exponential effect since any gains made by doing mini sorts near the end are simply postponing the inevitable sorts of the lower ranking tasks.  Either they get done or they get continually sorted down the stack as more amenable tasks are added and sorted up the stack.  In that manner it's marginally worse than a closed list of n integers in terms of work needed, a linear increase on an already exponential burden, not including the logging needed to produce and maintain the list.<br><br>It would be interesting to take a leaf from this well-worn path in computing and apply the FVP philosophy to more efficient non-exponential sorting algorithms and see if a killer system emerges.  Exactly like FVP does now it would still sort tasks according to The Question, since that's its entire purpose, but with reduced algorithmic overhead.<br><br>Some food for thought - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm</a></div>

<div class="content">Chris:<br><br>I'm sure you're right, but since I'm not having any problem with the sort as it is I don't see much point for myself in investing the time necessary to develop a more efficient algorithm. But it would be advantageous for those who are using an app like Andreas's.<br><br>Perhaps you'd like to have a go?</div>
<h2>Reply by Alan Baljeu</h2>
<div class="meta">2015-06-5 0:57</div>
<div class="content">Chris, I thought about this.  The FVP system is a time-optimized selection sort (each loop select the best task; optimized because we don't rescan the entire list every time).  Best-case it's linear time (mark everything in order, do everything reverse order).  Worst case, you scan the whole list but do the first task, scan again, do the second, etc., is quadratic (not exponential) time.<br><br>Most sorting systems are not at all suitable for task selection. The biggest trouble is that they demand going through the whole list over and over putting things in order without actually DOING anything because the goal is an ordered list.  By contrast, the goal here is familiarity with the list and action.  A pre-sorted may not prove as effective as a mixed-up list.<br><br>The common way to make list-sorting more efficient is to divide a list into small chunks and process each separately.  So for example, sort each page separately, then merge those ordered lists.  It's a more efficient way to get everything in order, but a very slow way to start working on something.</div>

<div class="content">I was thinking about this when FVP first came out -- it actually prompted me to read that same Wikipedia article about three times.  I can't say I understood it all -- it's been a decade or two since I've coded sorting algorithms!   LOL<br><br>Alan points out some reasons why exponential time isn't required.  But I think the main reason it's not a full exponential sort is that it's not fully recursive:  you stop once you've identified the top priority item, and don't continue on to get a fully prioritized list.  <br><br>Still, I think it's an open question whether there is a more efficient queuing algorithm for finding the top priority item.  The trick is making it easy and intuitive to maintain on a pad of paper with a list.   That's where Mark's brilliance comes in.   :-)<br><br>Even more interesting, to me at least, is finding an efficient queuing algorithm that doesn't do an exhaustive search for the top-priority item at all, but stops when it identifies something "good enough for action".  In other words, maybe the selected task isn't number 1 on the whole list, but it's got a good probability of being high enough value that it's a better overall value proposition to stop the selection algorithm now and just take action.   That's essentially what Colley's Rule is all about.   I'm wondering if this could give you a higher-value end result, say over the course of a day, with less overhead.</div>

<div class="content">I'm still trying to understand Chris's mathematics because they seem to contradict my own experience of working the list. <br><br>As I understand it he is claiming that in the FVP sort the number of comparisons is the square of the items. This seems to me to be greatly overstating the effort required. <br><br>For instance if we had a list of 10 items this would require 10 squared, i.e. 100 comparisons. But I can't imagine any circumstances in which this would be the case.<br><br>In the best case the list would be already in the correct order. In this case, it would take 9 comparisons using the FVP algorithm to confirm this. All one would do is go down the list dotting every item.<br><br>In the worst case the list would be in reverse order. I reckon this would take 45 comparisons to order correctly. The reason for this is that as each task is identified it is done, thus reducing the number of further comparisons.<br><br>The conclusion is that the nearer the list is to the correct order, the less the number of comparisons required. Now consider the composition of the list. The new, exciting items and the projects which are already under way will tend to congregate towards the end of the list. At the beginning of the list will be the less exciting items and projects which haven't yet got going. In other words the list is already half-way towards being in the correct order.</div>

<div class="content">I think part of the confusion is that FVP works on a *selection*, not a *sort*. As such, it's actually O(n) in the worst case. And since it's already in partially ordered form, that can actually be reduced.<br><br>There are ways to use a more advanced algorithm (e.g. a heap) if you want to keep track of partially sorted order.

<div class="content">The method of speeding up the sort by sorting a subset of the full list is basically the philosophy behind AF1. The upside is that selection is faster. The downside is that it's nothing like so sensitive to changing priorities and circumstances as FVP.</div>

<div class="content">Another factor that mitigates against too long a selection is that when I am scanning from the earlier items on the list list I tend to skim or even entirely omit the scan. This reason is this that I've already worked the latter part of the list pretty hard and therefore I know that there's nothing I need to go there for at the moment.<br><br>Of course this only works if you are using a method which allows you to skim the tasks.

<div class="content">After some reflection and fiddling with pen and paper, I'm quite sure now that FVP actually acts as as heap. This allows for optimal number of comparisons to select the next "largest" item. This is also the data structure which is generally selected to do "priority queues" in which items are continuously being added to the system to do and should be done in priority order.<br><br>You're write Chris, its sorting algorithm analog is the heap sort, I had gotten confused about whether you were talking about each 'run' of FVP or how it acts over the long term. Each run of FVP selects the next largest existing item from the highest level of the heap, so the items get popped out in sorted order.<br><br>Here's an illustrative example, using the directions:<br><br>Email<br>In-Tray<br>Voicemail<br>Project X Report<br>Tidy Desk<br>Call Dissatisfied Customer<br>Make Dental Appointment<br>File Invoices<br>Discuss Project Y with Bob<br>Back Up  <br><br>We start comparing email to each one in turn. In-Tray is lower priority, so it becomes a child:<br><br>Email<br>¬†¬†¬†¬†In-Tray<br>Voicemail<br>Project X Report<br>Tidy Desk<br>Call Dissatisfied Customer<br>Make Dental Appointment<br>File Invoices<br>Discuss Project Y with Bob<br>Back Up  <br><br>Voicemail is larger, so it becomes the parent of Email:<br><br>Voicemail<br>¬†¬†¬†¬†Email<br>¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†In-Tray<br>Project X Report<br>Tidy Desk<br>Call Dissatisfied Customer<br>Make Dental Appointment<br>File Invoices<br>Discuss Project Y with Bob<br>Back Up  <br><br>Project X Report is smaller, so it becomes a child of Voicemail:<br><br>Voicemail<br>¬†¬†¬†¬†Email<br>¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†In-Tray<br>¬†¬†¬†¬†Project X Report<br>Tidy Desk<br>Call Dissatisfied Customer<br>Make Dental Appointment<br>File Invoices<br>Discuss Project Y with Bob<br>Back Up  <br><br>We continue until our list is "heapified"<br><br>Tidy Desk<br>¬†¬†¬†¬†Voicemail<br>¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Email<br>¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†In-Tray<br>¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Project X Report<br>¬†¬†¬†¬†Call Dissatisfied Customer<br>¬†¬†¬†¬†Make Dental Appointment<br>¬†¬†¬†¬†File Invoices<br>¬†¬†¬†¬†Discuss Project Y with Bob<br>¬†¬†¬†¬†Back Up  <br><br>Now, we do Tidy desk, then we scan through the next indented level, do backup, etc. In fact, it looks a lot like the animation from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort</a></div>

<div class="content">Aside from not making lists with "lunch" and "make tea" on them and then actually sorting them, you mean?</div>

<div class="content">Chris:<br><br>I put lunch on because I tend to forget it, and tea for the opposite reason - to stop me drinking too much. It doesn't take any time to sort something at the end of the list. The algorithm handles that sort of trivial task extremely efficiently - as well as more weighty matters.</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br>Yup, that's correct. The FVP algorithm is the best you're able to do on this type of problem.<br><br>The number of comparisons needed to do a list of size N in order is N*log(N). The only way you could do it faster is if all the items on the list happened to be written in the correct priority order.<br><br>I'm very impressed with how the notation and working the system provides the same functionality as a heap in such a compact, simple way.</div>

<div class="content">"I put lunch on because I tend to forget it"<br><br>How can you "forget" lunch?  It's like "forgetting" 1pm.  If you feel hungry then sort out some food.  If you're busy and miss it then you weren't that affected by it so skip it and eat later.<br><br>"and tea for the opposite reason - to stop me drinking too much"<br><br>Then don't make it?  Tea only goes down your throat because you brewed up.  Do you really need a list with the word "tea" on it to remember not to brew up?  When you're filling the kettle do you think "I'll just check my list... woah, what am I doing with this kettle, I nearly forgot!"<br><br>I'm struggling to see how you can justify the admin of adding these menial routine non-tasks to a list, asking questions of them and then crossing them off, and calling that a productive use of your available time.  And then to claim it's a productive day because dozens of these things got done.  By your criteria I get about 3x as much work as you do done every day without using any system.<br><br>"It doesn't take any time to sort something at the end of the list. The algorithm handles that sort of trivial task extremely efficiently - as well as more weighty matters."<br><br>What else should go on the list?  Brush teeth?  Go to the toilet?  Inhale air?  Sorry but this is bonkers, a system which 'solves' the problems of doing things that ordinary people just do without a second thought, a system which massively over-analyses the routine and then markets that as efficient accomplishment.<br><br>I doubt anyone will agree with that, so I'll leave you all to it.</div>

<div class="content">Although my personal preference isn't to add certain routine activities I don't see how or why this would be a problem for anybody else.<br><br><br>My Sample List from 6th June using the 'no question' algorithm plus a bunch of techniques learnt from Mark over several years (Also attended a social event which took up 6 hours of the day):<br><br>- Journal / development time<br>- Hang clothes up / ironing (there were loads from holiday hangover)<br>- (Research) pros and cons of alarm systems<br>- Inbox processing (2 sessions)<br>- Wrap (Son's) final presents<br>- Set camping dates for summer<br>- Pay for (Son's) school trip online<br>- Fully charge camera for pictures<br>- Photo headshots kids football teams (16 of them)<br>- Email pics to club secretary<br>- Fill out and pay for (Son's) football registration form<br>- Image backup<br>- Charge smaller camera<br>- write ideas about act, record, complete<br>- Cut hair (OK I don't have loads of hair)<br>- Review Stone of Life <br>- Journal writing / development time<br>- Work out football teams for festival (next day)<br><br><br>I thought it was a productive day by my standards. I used a bunch of Mark's methods accumulated over the years plus the current 'no question' algorithm. Thanks for your help, Mark.</div>
