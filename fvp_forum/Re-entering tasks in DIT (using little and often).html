<div class="content">Somehow I have always been reluctant to try DIT but was realising over the last months that this might be because the principles are exactly what I need. At least in my new work environment as a part-time project manager with a wide variety of skills and mindsets in our teams, it seems like the systems provided in DIT are just what I need to approach my work and life in a calm manner. <br><br>After reading (and now partly re-reading) the book and a break in using the system, I restarted using it yesterday and wonder again: What do I do with re-entry and little and often? Do I <br>a) re-enter the task today below the line (unless I feel like I have done enough for today, in which case I re-enter it on tomorrow's list)<br>b) or leave a task without crossing it off where I feel like I haven't done enough for today?<br>c) or do I re-enter the task on tomorrow's list, no matter how little I have done?<br><br>What I get hung up on: I cannot reliably say how the rest of my day will go, having small children as well as a highly volatile work environment. So in case c), I might not get to the task again although it is more important that I work again on this task today than the other tasks, while in case a) I might end the day with a lot of unfinished tasks, while having them on "tomorrow" would have given my day the proper closure. <br><br>How ist litte and often/re-entry of tasks supposed to be dealt with in DIT, and how do/did you resolve any hang-ups around that issue?</div>

<div class="content">It probably doesn't matter how you do it but it might be best to be consistent. So for example let's say the task is wash the dishes. You've washed the morning breakfast dishes but expect there to be later dishes in the day. So you could leave it on the list or put a check by it to show that you've done some work on it</div>

<div class="content">But let's say the day has ended and you haven't washed any dishes. You could either leave it on the list and then when you review yesterday's list you will see that it was not crossed off. Or you could say it is so urgent that I need to be reminded of it and put it on for the next day. You could even have it repeated yesterday and today.</div>

<div class="content">Thank you, Mark! I'm sorry I didn't see this, I thought the post didn't go through but I seem to have posted my question under the FV/FVP-Forum by mistake. <br><br>Indicating that I have done some work does sound relieving. I can cross it off once I end my day/at the start of the following day as "I know I did some work on it (even though I didn't revisit it as intended). <br><br>Though I came to the conclusion that I should aim to use this sparingly - if anyone else is interested in this question, too: Chapter 6 (Emergency, what emergency?, Tomorrow, Answers, 5) says "If you are in doubt, 'Do it tomorrow'". And as next day's list gets actioned as part of today's Will do list, I probably should keep this in mind and if it is urgent but not to the point it justifies staying on today's list, I know to only do a little on all of today's tasks so I can advance the task in question as well as the other tasks that were previously on today's list as part of the entry "Next day's list" on my Will do list if there is no interruption.<br><br>Either way, I had some time off work and will have to post an update on how this works out when there are a few demanding days in a row.</div>

<div class="content">When doing DIT, if I had actioned a task today, and knew I wasn't going to do it again today, I would cross it off, and rewrite on tomorrow's list.  Then today's list would be shorter.  <br>However, if one has actioned the task, but not sure if you will action it again today, then you might want to put some indication that you have done some work on it.  You could write the number of minutes spent beside the task, or put a check by it.  At the end of the day, you could transfer those tasks to tomorrow.  <br>Or you could leave it where it is (you might run out of time to rewrite it) and then when reviewing the next day either do action on the item before rewriting it, or rewrite it, and then do action on it later. <br>Another possibility - only rewrite or cross off when the task is completely done, so it remains on the previous days.  This is less rewriting. I don't like to do this, because I would rather be reminded today.  Too much time and the task might slip.  If several days have elapsed without doing the task, I might rewrite it on today anyway to make sure it stays current.</div>
