<div class="content">Just a reminder, especially for new folks, that there's a PayPal donation button on the right-hand margin of the webpage.   It's an easy way to thank Mark for his ongoing brilliant work that helps so many people!   (And he's supposed to be retired!  LOL)</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br>Yes, except that there isn't a PayPal donation button on the right-hand margin at the moment. I took it off so that people wouldn't use it in error when supporting the London Bridgathon: <a href="../blog/A Message from Mark's Daughter Anna.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2015/7/23/a-message-from-marks-daughter-anna.html</a> .<br><br>I'm pleased to say that with 46 days to go we have already raised £836 ($1,307) !</div>
