<div class="content">I realize most folks are pursueing a no list method. However I am trying a way to impliment FV in a different way. In other words: instead of changing the operation of FV, I'm changing how I use it. Kind of like not filing down a hammer to try to fit a screw, rather using the hammer to hit something.<br><br>First, let me explain my concerns and what I'm trying to do:<br>I worry constantly that some upcoming calendar item will "sneak up" on me and I will not have adequetly prepared for it. This is a concern because many of these calendar items require me to spend 10 to 20 hours of preparation.<br>Of course, I want to be able to take care of all those little tasks as well.<br><br>It hit me awhile ago that rather than modifying the internal aspects of a system, I might find success by using the system in a different way. Let me explain:<br><br>I have been entering all events on my calendar. If there is no preparation involved (ie I only have to show up), then that's it. <br>However if there is preparation needed I then mark (***) the calendar item with some mark. This alerts me to plan and prepare.<br><br>For example: ***prepare presentation<br>On my task list, I then write: ***(date it's due) prepare presentation. Research topic<br>I do this for every item on my calendar which has preparation involved.<br><br>Okay, now comes the part where I'm using FV in a different manner:<br>I now have a task list that contains both calendar prep items as well as non-date specific items (ie talk with wife about xx)<br>I review my calendar to remind myself of upcoming events. Then I mark my list (FV style) with items I'd like to do over the next week or so. My question is "over the next week, what do I want to do?"<br>This tends to create a chain of fairly large size.<br><br>This chain/list is then used for daily use. However, I only create a chain from this chain/list once per day.<br><br>If something urgent comes up, I just add it to the daily list.<br><br>The attempt is to use FV to funnel my longer list. This is done on a weekly basis and then on a daily basis. This way I can breathe easier knowing that I have identified the things I need to work on over the next few days, and the items I've selected for today are in-line with my short term weekly obligations.</div>

<div class="content">Tommy, I think your system is now basically very close to traditional Covey system - select weekly tasks from master tasklist and big rocks, then every day select daily tasks from weekly tasks. The main difference is order of tasks - which stays solid/unchanged in your case.<br><br>I do not mean it as negative comment (I myself use Covey approach a lot)- for me it is interesting observation that FV can be merged with Covey in this way...</div>

<div class="content">Daneb,<br><br><< for me it is interesting observation that FV can be merged with Covey in this way... >><br><br>Just about all my systems are designed so that they can be used with any "higher level" methods.</div>

<div class="content">Wow. This is brilliant. I have been searching about superior qualities of FV which I assumed I might have missed.. Particularly not loosing focus on long range horizon / big rocks. <br>I'm going to give it a try</div>
