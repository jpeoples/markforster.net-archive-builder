<div class="content">Wanting ti do a list is foolish for me. You may have 10 A4 pages how to do it and to be sure to do the right things at the right time. AF and FV did not solve my problem. <br><br>I spoke about the way I have organized OF for following my projects. But I wanted to share with you a capital way i.e. how I manage the all incoming stuff and way I really have to do each day. Then I a admit Omnifocus is my collector of tasks. I can have there a thousand there will be no consequences. This is why. <br><br>I have a paper A4 note book <br>Each day I strt with today's days then I add <br>- my appointments<br>- My priorities 'MIProjects"<br>- My tasks of the day <br><br>These are my must do tasks<br><br>Then during the day I report in an AF way all incoming information and task I don't want to do today. If I want to do them today they go after "My tasks of the day"<br>At night I close the 2 lists and report from this list what i must do now on the next day date and what is left is crossed or reported in OF and I extract from OF what I must do tomorrow it goes of cours after  "My tasks of the day" of tomorrow<br><br>The result is nice. I do what I must do and one day per week on wednesday i do a gtd weekly review. For the tasks of the day I do them one after the other and try to group by projects<br>Hope that s helps.</div>

<div class="content">There are times when FV on the entire list won't work -- usually if I have a lot to get done by a deadline and high-resistance, low-priority tasks at the top. I shouldn't work on those tasks at all those days. I need today's tasks up front and centre, and the other tasks as far as possible from my attention.<br><br>In that case, I make a list of what needs to be done by the deadline, and work FV on just that list. Usually lists like that take forever. Using FV and the chains, I get through the list much faster. Then I have time to do a chain on the entire list again.</div>

<div class="content">Hi,<br>why not add the list of urgent tasks/project to the end of the list and mark them with a dot?</div>

<div class="content">@Jens<br>Making 2 lists <br>One for must do task (left page) and incoming must do task of the day on the left page<br>And one like AF/ FV list on the right page for task I will do asap, <br>Helps me a lot.<br><br>Of course in each I dot some. But there is a nice balance between the 2.<br><br>At night reporting in Of the future items and my thoughts in EN lets me follow the subject efficiently. <br><br>At last, taking the incoming information on the next morning day from OF or EN and reporting the tasks on one of each list make things up to date and clarify what must be. <br><br>In fact it is like 3 warehouse <br>3. One for the stuff whatever (= Omnifocus)<br>2. One for the current in the day (= The right page list)<br>1. One for the must do tasks (=the left page list) <br><br>and I treat them from 1 to 3 !</div>

<div class="content">@jens Good question. My pre-Mark habit was to copy tasks from one list to another, without doing any work on them at all. Little-and-often slipped to "just get out the folder, then leave it open on the desk and just get out another folder." My knee-jerk reaction is to insist I work on something before rewriting it, even though I know intellectually I should work on "often".<br><br>When I'm overwhelmed, I revert to the systems that worked pretty-well, rather than a system that, unless I'm careful, slips to one that didn't work at all.</div>

This speaks to the urgency issue that Jim Dandy has raised several times already.<br><br>What do you think of my FV tweak to keep urgent tasks front and center?
