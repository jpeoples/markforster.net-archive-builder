<div class="content">In most of Mark's systems since DIT (and even before), the concept of a closed list was key. At first I was wondering if he had abandoned this in FV.<br><br>But then I realised what should have been obvious: each time you finish the preselection process, you have a new closed list to work from. What's more, this list constitutes also what Mark used to call a "will do" list.</div>

<div class="content">I think you have hit on something, Marc.  Maybe this will be the greatest strength of FV: combining the fluidity of the "one single list" with the focus of the "selected items list".</div>

<div class="content">Yeah, I was struck by the same thing. I'd been using DWM2 and was really missing the closed list.<br><br>One amazing thing about FV is that it can be applied not only to a paper list, but also to an email backlog, a box of clutter, a stack of index cards ("hipster PDA") ... just grab the first item, construct the ladder of things to handle first, and then get started. In email programs, you could use the flag/star to mark the preselected items. So now you can have a psychologically motivating closed "list" of anything!</div>

<div class="content">I never considered my email backlog. Thanks for that I will definitely be working on them using FV!</div>

<div class="content">Marc, I was asking similar question, although it took someone else to give me the answer that you came to yourself. Some good discussion on it here:<br><a href="../fvp_forum/Closed List vs FV.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/fv-forum/post/1782661</a></div>

<div class="content">After a few busy/scheduled days with minimal use of the list, I'm about to start a new chain. It feels like flipping through a catalog and placing an order for all my favorite things. And a few necessities.</div>
