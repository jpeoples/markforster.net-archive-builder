<div class="content">I thought I'd share this small tip. When starting a new preselection, I mark the root item not with a dot, but with a small triangle (could be anything you like: a star, ...). That way, as I'm working backwards through the preselected items, it's easy to see when I've reached the top of the list.<br><br>This is useful for me, because after some time working on the list, I don't always remember what the root item was. For others, it may be overkill ;)</div>

<div class="content">Love it, especially the star! It fits perfectly with the way the I feel like completing the last dot in a chain is something like a prize. I have already experienced doing some really high-resistance tasks with FV simply because they were the last one in the chain. <br><br>Nice, simple addition.</div>

<div class="content">Isn't it clear when you've reached the "root" item at the top of the list, because all other tasks prior to this item are crossed off?</div>

<div class="content">Jeff N:<br><br>Not in my case. I started from an existing AF1 list. This means that the initial items are spread very thinly over several pages (something like 3 remaining items per page), with some completely finished pages in between. As I use AF since 3 years now, my root items started on page 138. So especially if the preselected chain is somewhat long (in number of items or in time spent on it), I don't always see if I reached the top of the chain or if there is still another item 7 pages earlier...</div>

<div class="content">How did you mark completed pages before? X at the top of the page? Tear off a corner? When you reach the first non-torn corner, you're on the last page.<br><br>Having said that, I like the psychology of treating that first task as something special.</div>

<div class="content">I keep a number of paperclips in my notebook - one on the first page, one on the open page, and one on the page I'm currently working (I "lose" that more than I "lose" my first page). It's been working pretty well for me.</div>
