<div class="content">I've gotten some great feedback on my original incremental timeboxing application. (THANKS!)    TimeBoxer is now a silverlight application so you can run it on windows, mac, and linux PCs.  And it is still free!   Here's the link:  <br><br>     <a href="http://timeboxer.ericjorgensen.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://timeboxer.ericjorgensen.com</a><br><br>This app "gameifies" todo lists.  This is extremely helpful for people like me who get easily distracted from the task at hand.    Users have reported that using Timeboxer provides a significant improvement in their ability to get stuff done and stick with their lists.</div>

<div class="content">I have tried it for two weeks now.  And I love it! At work it is very effective together with my FV list and my computer based work. <br><br>I also use it at home. I cannot take the computer with me everywhere and my android mobile will not read the website with Silverlight. But I keep the laptop and timeboxer at the kitchen table and in my pocket I have my mobile with an alarm on. I run around cleaning kitchen, doing laundry, cutting the lawn, digging in the kitchen garden. When the alarm rings I run back to the computer to get my points and see "What’s next to do? » Having fun, as if it was a game :-) <br><br>Thank you :-)</div>

<div class="content">p.s. I'm a mac user so I don't get automatic updates on MS stuff.....actually I manually update many of my apps.....especially when Firefox jumps the gun and uses buggy updates sometimes!  (They have improved.)</div>

<div class="content">I still use it everday at work. My FV list is much smaller than it used to be. I take 4 taskes at a time and 20 minutes for each of them. If they take less time, i just click the x. If I need more time i put the task on the list for the next 4 tasks also.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Eric,<br>I stumbled upon you application few days ago and... it is AMAZING!!!<br><br>It helped to screw up a procrastination spiral I was tunneled in. I have used it together with FV with fixed time-length boxes, as suggested by Mark Forster in is first book (e.g. 5 minutes for each task, in a chain of 10). <br><br>I have seen that it works marvellously either with a checklist (a list of related task to one single goal) or with a list of different task.<br><br>The magic of this program is the scoring system. It really motivates to keep going as fast as you can!!!<br><br>Brilliant piece of software. Thank you very much for sharing this with us.<br><br>ps: may I suggest for a couple of tiny 'improvements'?<br><br>1) a calculation of the total amount of real time spent on a chain. This could be very helpful for time planning purposes, especially with recurrent checklists.<br><br>2) a reset button for total amount of task performed<br><br>3) the possibility to save chains for being reused.</div>

<div class="content">4) possibility to randomize the list could be fun (<a href="http://www.random.org/lists)" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.random.org/lists)</a><br><br>And I still use timeboxer every day. Now i usually have four tasks at a time and 7,5 minutes for each task. <br><br>I pick them from my FV -list, and i guess it's not a FV-list since I don't ask the question and have four tasks in a chain. But I always select the oldest task at the top.</div>

<div class="content">1-3 have been completed and are currently available on the beta site:  <a href="http://timeboxer.ericjorgensen.com/beta" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://timeboxer.ericjorgensen.com/beta</a><br><br>I'll put 4 on my todo list and add it as soon as I can.  <br><br>Thanks for the ideas!<br><br>-e</div>

<div class="content">I fell off the TimeBoxer bandwagon for awhile and began using timers instead.  My productivity dropped dramatically because I kept forgetting to reset the timers.  I also started to ignore them.  I am back to TimeBoxer!  I've never found anything else that worked as well for me.  I find it really keeps me on track and realistic about what I can accomplish in a day.  It also helps me to stay relaxed and focused.  I like the new feature of being able to save lists.  I now have a morning work routine, an after lunch routine and an end of day routine in addition to my daily task lists.  I set my "program" for the day and go!  Thanks for a fantastic program!</div>

<div class="content">It was fun to take TimeBoxer out for a spin, but I found the tutorial confusing (terminology didn't seem to match the actual UI) and couldn't really see how to use it long-term.</div>

<div class="content">I still use timeboxer everyday at work. But i was now planning to start with 50 minutes and let the time boxes decrease with 15 minutes. 50, 35,20,5. I can't figure out how I do this in the new verison. Can any one help?</div>

<div class="content">excellent software.  if anything, it works too effectively (i build up huge resistance to pushing the "start" button).  DIT tells me to to tell myself "I will not do any work, I will just push the start button"!<br><br>One thing though, running the app makes my computer overheat.  I'm not sure if anyone else has this problem.</div>
