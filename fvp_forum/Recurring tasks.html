<div class="content">What's agood way of getting recurring tasks in FV? AF4 kept them on a separate page which is an option, but goes against the spirit of FV it seems to me</div>

<div class="content">I've tried a few methods.<br><br>The first method is write it on the next line in the main FV list, but write the "next due" date next to it. Since most of my repeats are fuzzy, I also like to write the date last done. That way, even if I change the target frequency I know how long it's been since I last did it. I found that didn't work -- it was to hard to skip a line for a week, and then remember to include it.<br><br>The next method is to use a calendar or datebook. As you finish each task, write it on the next day you want to do it. The FV list is everything on today and older days. Or, you can start each day by copying tasks from the calendar to the FV list. I found the second worked a bit better. When I just used the datebook, the days I added several tasks (importing old lists or after a busy meeting) didn't have enough room, but most days had way too much. A datebook that lets you add pages between the dates if needed might work. Again, I found knowing when I last did the task helped.<br><br>If you use EverNote on Windows, you can change the "date created" to the tickler date, or you can use tags. Farther dates need less detail. All 2014 is one tag. 2013 is by season. 2012 is by month, and the next two months are by week. A recurring task would be to look at the next big tag and expand it as needed. <br><br>Another method is to use checklists, perhaps one per frequency. The FV task is then "work on checklist". You'll need to keep remember how well you're doing on those checklists so you know how much you want to "work on checklist".<br><br>My current spreadsheet has a column for ideal frequency. It takes that and the date-last-done and calculates the tickler date. I sort by tickler date before each pre-selection. It works well enough for now, although when I'm done importing old lists and no longer need the search feature I might print it out and go back to paper, or bite the bullet and learn how to do databases and a better user interface in my husband's favourite programming language.</div>

<div class="content">My current method is a hybrid of the two ideas that Cricket mentions.  I've got a weekly interval list and a monthly interval list.  I take four or five of the weekly items and two or three of the monthly items and put them on the main list with a last done date and either (w) or (m) to remind me of which list they came from.  On the interval list I mark them with a dot so I know they're on the main list.<br><br>When I do an item on the main list, I cross it off the interval list and re-add it at the end with the date I last completed it. Then I take the oldest item on the interval list and add it to the main list.<br><br>It's a bit cumbersome, but "do a weekly housework task" doesn't get actioned no matter how I phrase it.  Something about a separate list really doesn't work for me that way.  Having "scrub the grout in the bath" on the main list means it benefits from the procrastination-busting and little-and-often effects of FV and it really does get done.  I'm not getting around to the weekly tasks every week yet, nor the monthly tasks in a month, but I'm getting around to them better than I have in at least half a year.  I think with a bit more adjustment of how many live in the main list I'll get an interval that really is a week or less.</div>

<div class="content">R.M., That sounds like my old rotating lists for recurring tasks method (poorly described somewhere in these forums). Seeing all my supposedly-weekly tasks in one place, with the oldest one on top and the ones I just did on the bottom kept me very aware of how I was doing. Being able to write it at the end of the weekly list (worst case turn a page) rather than turn to the next target date in the calendar made it much smoother. Who would expect that turning to "same day next week" or "same date next month", even with sticky flags, would be such an annoyance!<br><br>Bringing them over to the main list might be worth the extra writing, although I didn't do so, to my detriment. Even with "work on weekly list" in my main list, they were "out of sight, out of mind". Also, I didn't balance work on the lists very well. I made great strides on the weekly list (I saw it every few days), but the monthly and seasonal lists (mostly high-resistance things like cleaning the gutters) got short-changed. Having all the current tasks on the main list will help balance them better.<br><br>I'm going to keep your method in my back pocket.</div>

<div class="content">It's utterly possible your post was what led to me trying the lists divided by interval.  I can't recall where the idea came from and I've been lurking here quite a long while.  Glad that it looks possibly useful for you - it's nice to give a little back after I've gotten so much here.</div>

<div class="content">If it's daily, I have a list of such.<br>If it's rigidly recurring, it goes on a calendar.<br>If it's flexible, about once a week, it goes in FV.<br>If it's flexible but much less than a week, the calendar reminds me to put it in FV.<br><br>About "doesn't get actioned", I find it will after a few days and it creeps forward in the list.</div>

<div class="content">I pretty much do more or less what's already been mentioned. For things that are not on rigid schedules (changing the cat boxes, for example) I just immediately re-enter them in the list with a notation of when they were last done. For things that have to be done on specific days (my checklist of things that I have to do after class, for example), in my electronic setup (using ToDo) I have a list of "repeating tasks" that I can duplicate those tasks out of into my main FV list.</div>

<div class="content">Most of my recurring tasks occur in "workflow lists" that FV references. When I'm done with the workflow (which is itself recurring), I simply reenter it at the bottom of the list. No special notation is necessary. You know if you need to do it again when you scan.</div>

<div class="content">A good feature of using Evernote for FV (or other digital list sorted by modifiable updated date) is you can set a task to a future date, further out before the end of list at today's date.<br><br>I have that option in mind, if it becomes necessary. However, I currently have my daily, weekly, monthly recurring tasks all mixed up in main FV list (170+ tasks). Those tasks looks like ...<br><br>(d) Mark Forster Final Version FV forum<br>Get video for ITS World Congress Tokyo<br>(d) Weight<br>(d) Gmail<br>(w) RnD meeting (SMS & MZR)<br>(w) RnD calendar (Fri-Sun)<br>(m) Bills 15apr12<br><br>I choose to prefix (d), (w) & (m) to tasks title, instead of tags. I find they help me pick those recurring tasks while pre-selecting by first few words of the tasks title.<br><br>When necessary to see just the daily tasks, I could filter the FV list by, intitle:"(d)" and similar.</div>

<div class="content">If you are using TaskPaper, it's easy to handle recurring tasks:<br><br>-- flexible ones, with no specific date, are just re-entered at the end of the respective ( project ) list : same procedure as Zack has mentioned above, if you are using dedicated AoR ( Area of Responsibility ) as I do<br><br>-- scheduled ones, with a specific date, are entered once in e.g. the dedicated AoR sub-project of the main "Scheduled" ( project ) list<br><br>This set up does "declutter" the main working lists and nevertheless let you focus on the respective recurring tasks, when they do become "visible".</div>
