<div class="content">I found 2 tips Which help me doing I want to share with you. <br>One is about someone (He will recognize him self and thanks to him) is using one color per week. I use blue for this week and it was black last week. This is great for knowing what happened and what is happening. <br><br>The secont is before acting, re writing in the right way the items one by one and reformulating them, if necessary. I use a special page for this on my paper note book. 2 advantages : <br>1) It makes me focus on what i must do and clarify my thinking<br>2) They can be many pages, so sumarize things let me a close list<br>3) When there is nothing I want acting on the main list is dismiss so I get a new list on the flow perfectly clean of what I really want to do !</div>
