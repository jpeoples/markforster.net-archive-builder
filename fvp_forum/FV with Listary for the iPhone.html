<div class="content">Method coming soon. First, download the normally paid app for free today:<br><br><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/listary-share-sync-lists/id409317192?mt=8&ls=1" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/listary-share-sync-lists/id409317192?mt=8&ls=1</a></div>

<div class="content">That would work exactly the same, I guess? With several advantages like synching and simpler archiving for instance… What app do you prefer for FV, Listary or Clear?</div>

<div class="content">I bought the listary app, only .99 cents yesterday, but it's up to you if want to experiment on it, or not. I'm still thinking of also getting the Clear app since I've seen a lot of interest in it.<br><br>But am curious as to how you would use listary of course.<br><br>Thanks for the tips so far<br><br>And thanks Mark F. for the FV system.</div>

<div class="content">David:<br><br><br>"I am still curious to read about your Listary integration."<br><br>... Was on holiday for a bit so I'm just now getting back to the FV tribe. This post is on my list!<br><br><br><br>"That would work exactly the same, I guess? With several advantages like...simpler archiving…"<br><br>... Yes. You can use it with Clear Method 2.1. There is another way which I'll describe soon.<br><br><br><br>"What app do you prefer for FV, Listary or Clear?"<br><br>... Clear. Followed by Paperless. Method coming soon!</div>

<div class="content">For what it's worth, I've been using Listary and the "Clear method" for several months. The big advantage is the ability to edit the list (in Simplenote) from my laptop. I have several other lists in Listary as well - packing, shopping, checklists (morning routine, monthly and weekly tasks at work), etc.</div>
