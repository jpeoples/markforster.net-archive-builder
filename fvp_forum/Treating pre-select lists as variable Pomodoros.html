<div class="content">I like the Pomodoro Technique - essentially working in 25-minute focused blocks, with forced short breaks afterwards and no detours allowed until each block is done. It helped me extend my ability to focus. However, the 25 minutes often felt arbitrary. Sometimes I wanted to (and could) work less, and sometimes more. What I really liked was two things: the short bursts, and the commitment with myself to focus and work the whole time without distraction. <br><br>I've started treating my FV preselect lists as variable-time Pomodoros. I keep the dotted list  short, and I try to get all the way through the list without getting off track. Any new things that come up get added to the list for review next round. <br><br>I preselect based on my perception of my focus ability at that moment. Feeling focused? Preselect a few more things. Feeling scatter-brained? Preselect a list of only 2-3. <br><br>This is also helping me with the "little and often" principle. As long as I can do SOMETHING for each, I can cross it off and add it again to the bottom. This is helping me keep everything moving, and not feel concerned that I'm missing anything urgent.</div>

<div class="content">Scott,<br><br>I think this is a great idea. My recent chains (ladders?) have been all over the map, in terms of numbers of tasks and length of time to complete them. Ideally, I would like to get through several chains each day. <br><br>So do you try to complete, say, a 3-task chain in 25 minutes or so? Do you estimate the time upfront or "slice the tomato" to time each task, so you action (a bit of) each before the timer goes off?<br><br>I think I'll try this idea today, and use the break times to browse this forum (one of my favorite guilty pleasures).</div>

<div class="content">ubi,<br><br>I also find FV works a lot better when I go through several chains a day. <br><br>I don't use the 25-minute time, even as a benchmark, and I don't use a timer. My goal is to just get through the current chain in one "sitting" or one "burst of focus". It might involve running around to different departments, but as long as I don't get distracted off the chain before I finish, I consider it a completed chain Pomodoro. I'm not using "Pomodoro" in the strict sense, of course. It's a variable-length Pomodoro. The point is that it can't be broken. It's not time-based, but rather chain-based.<br><br>I look at the open time I have until my next meeting (which is more relevant if it's a short time), then take a look inward to see how much focus I feel I have at the moment, and then preselect by intuition. When in doubt, I preselect fewer items. <br><br>I love the idea of using the breaks for guilty pleasures! I think it works really well with FV. Working the chain builds momentum to finally deal with the last dot, and the promise of a guilty pleasure (without the guilt!) after finally dealing with that last dot motivates me even more!<br><br>This technique seems to be most appropriate for those of us who work best in concentrated bursts.  :)</div>

<div class="content">While the Pomodoro technique as written had little value for me, less-structured timeboxing has helped me embrace "little & often." The timer sets a boundary around a task so that I can focus on it without any chance of getting too absorbed and blowing the rest of the day's schedule. For creative or interesting tasks, this has always been a big problem for me, discouraging me from working on important projects when my day is not wide open.<br><br>Timeboxing in FV can be a little tricky, because the timebox you would want depends on whether anything time-sensitive is left in the current chain. Of course, it's easy enough to flip back and see the chain, but I find it one of those little psychologically obstructing things. It certainly messes up the flow, that feeling of having my work pre-selected, when I still have a decision to make before I can start the task.<br><br>But now I've found a simple way to timebox within FV.<br><br>Add to your FV list:<br><br>Project X 30 min<br>Project X 1 hr<br>Project X 90 min<br>Project X 2 hr<br><br>When one of these receives a dot, start a timer when you begin working on it, and forget all else until the timer rings. Then, if the project is not done, reenter the task with the same timebox duration.<br><br>The nice thing about this is your chain takes the timebox into account during preselection. I wouldn't expect it to work with more than one or two timeboxes per chain, or else you start having to do math while building the chain.</div>

<div class="content">I just thought I'd mention that there is a pretty neat app for iPhone called Pomio. It works very well for variable pomodoros and FV without any problems.</div>
