<div class="content">I have tried all the AF systems, SMEMA, ASEM, UTMS and UTMSi, the Bounce, basically all of Mark's systems.  All of them end up in me procrastinating, except for SMEMA, but SMEMA would make me forget things.  Since FV forces me to always do the first task, it solves this problem.  Am I doing anything wrong?  Why won't the other systems work for me?</div>

<div class="content">I'm in a similar position - FV (slightly tweaked)  is my default method. <br><br>I use SMEMA for short periods as well. Usually when I'm pushed for time or when I've been procrastinating.</div>

<div class="content">Sounds like a solution in search of a problem.</div>

<div class="content">To say "this works for me" is a highly subjective assessment. What does it really mean? What may be good enough for one person could be utter failure for the next.<br><br>Maybe the other systems worked as well, the told you: I am full of senseless stuff, dismiss all these tasks! Except you were too stubborn to do it.<br><br>But with FV you have this "must do"-short circuit so you end up "just doing it". Which means FV is successful at forcing yourself to do a lot of busy work.<br><br>Another thing I can think of is that maybe deep down you are not d'accord with what is on your plate.</div>
