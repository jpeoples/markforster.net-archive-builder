<div class="content">While FV sounds great, and seems to work well for many people, I'm giving up on it for now.  This is disappointing to me, because I had high hopes for FV, but it's not working for me.<br><br>I'm sure people will assume that I would be happy with standard FV if I stuck with that instead of creating Prioritized FV by tweaking the rewriting rule.  On the contrary, I still consider Prioritized FV to be an improvement over standard FV, and it allowed me to stick to the system longer than I otherwise would have, because it did a good job of keeping the high priorities front and center.  That's not the problem.<br><br>I'm finding resistance building to the core mechanism behind FV: preselecting a chain and then processing it.  Scanning the entire list repeatedly tends to be time-consuming and a bit mind-numbing, seeing the same tasks over and over again, but the real problem lies in processing the chain after it's been created.  After a while, the preselected chain starts to feel like a straightjacket, binding me to a predetermined course of action, and I don't care for being ordered around like that, even by my past self.<br><br>I could try standard FV again with no tweaks, but honestly, I doubt it would matter.  I expect that I would still feel resistance to the core mechanism of preselecting a chain and processing it, and without that mechanism, the system wouldn't be FV at all.<br><br>For the past week or so, I've been experimenting with a new system, primarily based on AF1, but with some tweaks based on my experience with Prioritized FV.  So far, I'm much happier with it, because I find I'm willing to use the list and process it, instead of avoiding the system.  I'll give it more time to see if it holds up and how it handles urgent/important tasks, but it's promising so far.  If all goes well, I'll post the details to the General Forum.</div>

<div class="content">I may give standard FV one more try, without tweaks, starting with an empty list.  However, I don't really expect it to work for me, because the core mechanism just doesn't sit right with me.  AF1 has a much more natural flow to it, and I think I need a system based on AF1, not based on FV.<br><br>I'm certain that I need to tweak AF1 somehow for urgent/important tasks -- I'm hopeful that the AF1 tweaks I'm testing will do the trick.  Time will tell.</div>

<div class="content">Why not use both?  do af1. But to combat urgent /important items, switch to FV.  switch back and forth on your own terms. <br><br>1.

Am I right? if so, then you have a bit of a conflict. That's why I'm suggesting switching between the two systems to appeal to both sides. <br><br> I'm sure if you take a moment and just review your tasks with an objective in mind you will just know what this order is based on priorities and what you are wanting to do. when I say objective I mean aim or target.

I had to tweak FV to create Prioritized FV because I found that FV didn't handle urgent/important tasks so efficiently, at least for me.<br><br>My current tweak to AF1 is based on my tweak to FV to make Prioritized FV.

If I wanted that, I'd try some sort of ABC prioritization scheme like Franklin Covey.  I want a system to keep me on track and efficient, reduce resistance, keep urgent/important items front and center, and keep anything from falling through the cracks.  AF1 seems to be the closest to meeting those goals, except for its weakness in handling urgent/important items.

If I'm adding to the chain to avoid a high-resistance task, I don't think that really qualifies as "no longer relevant".  It's just gaming the rules, isn't it?</div>

The only way I'll be able to reduce it is to finsih the tasks on my list. <br><br>Just curious, if you got no new tasks, how much time would it take to finish everything on your list? (not including time waiting for someone to provide you any info you need to do your job) I know it's not realistic to think that you will not get new tasks, but if you have, say, 30 days worth of tasks on your list now that you want to do this week, there's no way you'll get them all done. There literally isn't enough days in the week for that. Plus adding in new 'must do this week' tasks.  <br><br>And if your usual amount of new 'must to this week' tasks is 12 days worth, that's not realistic to think you'll get them done either. <br><br>I'm not sure why I think this (as in I can't quote anything specific) but it seems like you're got more than a week's worth of work to do in a week.

<div class="content">I'm find the FV gets bogged down with more than 3 or 4 pages of stuff to scan through to do the preselection.    The scanning takes too long, and completing the work for 1 chain takes too long.  I'd recommend declaring a backlog whenever your list starts taking too long, and just start over fresh with whatever tasks are most pressing on your mind.<br><br>With my FV+DIT approach, if I have outstanding tasks from 1 or 2 previous days, it's no big deal, I can usually deal with them -- clear them out totally -- during the course of a normal day.   But if I get further behind, and the previous pages are pretty full, or there are more than 1 or 2 of them, I have to declare a backlog and reset my active list.  <br><br>This helps keep the list fresh, keep it short and agile, and also gives me a good idea how much I can realistically accomplish in one day.</div>

<div class="content">Deven, <br><br>From what I've seen of your posts it seems that it often takes you a day or more to get through a single FV chain.  You might try making your chains short enough so that the whole chain can be done in a single sitting of 30 minutes or less.  That is the way that FV works best for me.<br><br>Striving for short chains makes me select only a few items (1-6) at a time, and to use the "little and often" principle on those items.  Most importantly, it means that I'm not trying to work on items that my "past self" selected in some other context.</div>

<div class="content">Deven (regarding Jeff N's post):<br><br><br>"...try making your chains short enough so that the whole chain can be done in a single sitting of 30 minutes or less."<br><br><br>... I came to the same conclusion as Jeff. I often ask "What makes sense to do right before X in the next 30 minutes?".<br><br>Focusing on a smaller time frame for my preselection improved FV for me. Conditions shift, keeping your times tight ensures chain relevancy, shorter chains, more oldest items are actioned, unfinished and newly urgent items get seen more often, the list is reviewed frequently, and scans of your list are quicker because less items will be chosen for doing in the next 30 minutes *right* before X.<br><br>I use an FV/A2 hybrid with metronome-style review of urgent and unfinished items "below the belt" and without A2's dismissal. During my experiments this month with all of Mark's systems I found that when using FV, 30 minute (or so) time frames work very well.</div>

<div class="content">I concur with Michael B. and Jeff N's fundamental notion that FV is improved by adding a time constraint.<br><br>The fundamental key to productive activity is little and often. For some research to support this view, I urge you to read any book by Robert Boice on getting published in academia.<br><br>If you deny little and often you get either:<br>1. big and often, or<br>2. big and infrequent, or<br>3. little and infrequent.<br><br>Big and often is impossible if you are going to get lots of things done.

<div class="content">I agree with limiting time, but not "...try making your chains short enough so that the whole chain can be done in a single sitting of 30 minutes or less."  30 minutes is a good time for 1 task, not all of them.  Maybe 2hrs is a sensible limit for a chain.</div>

<div class="content">+JMJ+<br><br>Caibre65 probably has hit on something, Deven: I have been using AF2 (at least a form of it), and I am thoroughly enjoying it.  And yes, I have not used FV since the outgo, I have been resisting against it and I don't know why :/<br><br>How about trying the AF2 form I have been using, Deven?  It is basically AF2 with this small yet big change: Everytime I process the list, I cross-out the oldest items until I hit upon a still relevant item, upon which I re-write it at the end and start processing.<br><br>I found that this removes the old problem of AF2 in which we "forget" old items.  This also takes care of the dismissal process.<br><br>But I think that best thing about this small yet big change is that it retains the main advantage of AF2 above all the other systems (which I honestly forgot until I started using this): "little and often".    More than any other of Mark's systems, AF2 exploits "little and often" because it re-presents to the user the task he had just rewritten a few items ago, reminding him of it.   It is not rare for me, using this system, to be surprised to finishing more than a few tasks almost simultaneously by jumping from one task to another over the day, which removes boredom and the feeling of being shackled to a task.  And it actually makes doing hard tasks easier because I am confident that, by using this system, I can lay off from the difficult task if need be and not forget about it because of how often this system reminds me of it.</div>

<div class="content">I find FV works quite well for me without any form of additional constraints (time or other). Maybe this is because I unconsciously or automatically adjust and finetune the chain length for it to work well. My oldest items are around 50 working days old (more than usual because of vacation period), I have 10 or 11 pages with items still open, adding up to between 90 and 100 open items at any time. I tend to finish between one and three chains in a typical day. All this is work (office) only.</div>

That's essentially what I am doing also.   <br><br>The value I always found in DWM was that I would reach an equilibrium -- my list size would balance out.   With all the other systems, my list would grow without end.   <br><br>But I didn't really like DWM's task-selection mechanism:   read through the list, and do whatever tasks stand out.   It didn't have the same feel as AF1 that made the standing-out idea so powerful.   It seemed a lot more mechanical, rather than engaging both the rational and unconscious mind, as in AF1.   <br><br>DWM's expiration mechanism combined with FV's task selection algorithm, gives you the best of both worlds.   In fact, I think they bring out the best in each other.    DWM keeps the FV shorter and nimbler, which makes it work more effectively.   FV softens the mechanical feel of DWM and makes it more intuitive.    <br><br>That's what I'm finding in my DIT/FV combination also.   But the DIT component has some advantages over DWM.   I am getting a MUCH better feel for how much I can really do in one day or one week, than I was ever able to get with DWM.   DWM did reach an equilibrium, but still, the list was too large to be really effective.   I never felt able to gauge my day-to-day, week-to-week workload with DWM.   <br><br>DIT solves this by adding one more constraint:  how much room do I have on my page for each day?    If I have 7-12 project items, and 7-12 recurring items, that's PLENTY to do in one day, at least for me.  <br><br>My list is in a 1-day-per page paper notebook, so it gives me a strong visual indication of how much I have committed for the day.   If my list were electronic, I'd need to be more creative to get such a strong visual cue of my overall workload.  I was never really able to do that in OneNote.</div>

<div class="content">I tried hard to make short FV chains that could be completed quickly, but it's easier said than done when many of my tasks make sense to spend hours on, once I get started.  While "little and often" is valuable, if I'm making good progress on a task, the last thing I want to do is interrupt the flow state, stop working on it and incur the context-switch overhead of starting another task JUST for the purpose of making sure it's "LITTLE and often".  Therefore, in practice, it's quite easy for the chain to become "stale".<br><br>Ultimately, I find I just don't like this mechanism.  Using the "standing out" approach to select an appropriate task to work on immediately feels much more conducive to productivity than predetermining a list of tasks to work on based on what made sense when the list was created.<br><br>As for using AF2, that's not something I've tried, but I have used my own AF1/AF2/CAF hybrid system before FV.  It worked okay, but I'd like something simpler.  Since the system with the most "staying power" seems to be AF1, I'm starting with straight AF1 as a base and experimenting with my own tweaks (based on my experience with tweaking FV and earlier systems) to address the known AF1 problems with urgency/importance, trying to keep the changes minimal.  So far it's going quite well, and I'm much happier with this system than I've been with any variant of FV.</div>

<div class="content">+JMJ+<br><br>@Deven: AF2 is much MUCH simpler than CAF, and AF2 as I am using now is actually simpler than FV and even plain vanilla AF1, and much more nimble.  There is no dismissal, you see, and the old strengths of excellent handling of urgent items and maximized use of "little and often" are retained while now much better in handling older items.<br><br>1. Make a list of tasks.  <br>2. Write any new task at the end of the list.<br>3. Delete the oldest task and re-write it at the end of the list (unless that oldest task is already irrelevant, upon which delete it and go to the next oldest task).<br>4.

I really like it.   <br><br>I'm still trying to work out some details.   For example:<br><br>Little and often - I'm trying to do this more, which means crossing things off and re-entering them, often on the same day's page.   It doesn't work unless there's room on the page.   This is one reason I find I need to stop adding new items to a page once it is 50 to 70% filled.<br><br>Matching work to available time - If I have lots of meetings or other things blocking my discretionary time, I have to fill even less.   At the beginning of the week, I look over my calendar for the week, and make a note of the days that are especially slammed with meetings.   I try not to enter much on my list for those days.<br><br>Separation of recurring items - At first, I was writing projects and one-off tasks at the top of the page, and recurring items in the middle of the page, and then reserving a couple lines at the bottom of the page for personal items (during the work week).    This gave me a very good feel for where my focus was for the day, and warned me if I was spending too much time on maintenance (recurring items).  <br><br>The last few days, I tried a simple list for each day, with everything mixed together, and then drawing a line at the end of the list at the beginning of the day, just like the DIT book says.   This gives more of a sense of today's page being a "closed list", which I like, but it totally loses the sense of what is recurring, what is work projects, what is personal, etc.<br><br>I'm trying to find a good compromise - first 10 lines for projects and one-offs, next 10 lines for recurring, and 2-3 lines at the very bottom of the page for personal.  (I try to put off all the personal stuff till the weekends.)<br><br>So, it's not an algorithmic system, at least not yet, but it has been very effective and gives me the best sense of any system I've tried for how much I really have on my plate, whether I need to scale down, or whether I can add another commitment or project.</div>

<div class="content">Nuntym<br><br>I seem to be doing something very similar, though I try to create a small chain of tasks. When this is done I start from the end of the list. <br><br>I also do an almost AF review of the first page of the list, those tasks that have been lingering longest. I pull either one or two (at the beginning of the day) that stand out and could be done today and rewrite them at the end of the list. I try and do them but don't stress if they don't get done, at least I've considered them.<br><br>I also add items that I would like to do or have to do today. They are already either on my FV list or project list but have become urgent (either ready to be started or to hit a nearing deadline). When they're near the end of the list they are in my line of sight - i'm confident that I'm not missing anything or having to trawl the list anxiously looking for anything potentially urgent.</div>

<div class="content">I hope too.  Until then, let me try :-)  Change your mindset from "being forced to do".  <br><br>Now when you get back to the first task on the list, you are not required to do it.  You are encouraged to, but if you don't want to you don't have to.  If you choose not, think about why you resist the task, and make a plan for what will help you overcome the resistance next time.  (Or you might consider the task unnecessary and delete it.)   Perhaps identify what little bit you can get started on.  Consider the task done and rewrite it at the end.<br><br>It's not cheating, because you actually did some progress.</div>

<div class="content">+JMJ+<br><br>Indeed.  The task chains also seem to hinder "little and often" because you have to finish the chain before you can return to a task, and that could also be a reason for the increased resistance.<br><br>I don't think that is a unique flaw of FV, however.  In AF1, you have to go through some pages of tasks to get to the unfinished task (unless you care currently in the last page).  In AF4 you have to go through the backlog.  In DWM and DWM2 you can jump right away to the unfinished task, but it can feel a bit forced since you may have to jump past a few (or more) pages.  The SF's were made to facilitate "little and often" but they also feel a bit forced because you have to decide right there and then whether to write at C2 or not.<br><br>AF2 however seems to be tailor-made for "little and often" because right after re-writing the unfinished task you have to <<pass through>> that unfinished item while looking at the list from the end, and believe me such items stick out like sore thumbs in the mind's eye.  AF2 will never let you forget those unfinished tasks that you left to idle minutes or hours ago.<br><br>The main problem with AF2 was that the longer the list was the harder it is to get to the oldest items because you start from the end of the list always.  The tweak of re-writing the oldest, still-relevant items to the end of the list everytime I choose tasks solved this issue.  Not only did it bring to fore the oldest and most neglected items in the list, it also helps in trimming down the list.  Please note that, from the instructions above, if the oldest task is already irrelevant, it is deleted and then you go to the next oldest task to determine its worthiness to be re-written; that next oldest task can still be deleted, and so on with th rest.  If I had done twenty tasks today, then I had rewritten twenty old tasks to the fore, but I could also have deleted some or many tasks too.<br><br>I started almost a week ago with this form of AF2 with a list of 80+ tasks, which is the list I have been using for the past couple of months using various other time management systems I tried.   Now, that same list has 36 tasks.  I think that should speak by itself.</div>

<div class="content">When I say chain I mean a small number of gradually more "difficult" tasks just to get a little momentum going. I may well not need to do this, it depends on how I feel. For example when I get to work my first selection of tasks will in most cases be:<br><br>Make cup of tea<br>Tidy Desk<br>Check voicemail<br>Check email<br><br>I should hopefully be engaged in work mode now so my next little chain might be<br><br>Call x to arrange appointment (easy)<br>Letter to Y (tedious but ok)<br>Begin work on project Z (not looking forward to this but I can manage 40 mins)<br>Check email (easy)<br>Break for a 10 minute browse on here (reward)<br><br>After the break I'm still probably engaged by project z so I dot it and do it, no need for a chain.<br><br>I'm effectively deciding on several things to do one after another that I feel flow naturally or logically. I use the same process when working on a client project. It might be:<br><br>Get file out<br>Review evernote notes<br>Review client business records<br>Detail work required<br><br>I'd just write the above items in my list and dot them all. I know intuitively which order to do them in.<br><br>I'm trying to get a flow going and use short chains to encourage this.</div>
