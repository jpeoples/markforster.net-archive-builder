<div class="content">I wonder if anybody is doing simple projects and contexts in FVP like I do.  It is influenced by how I have done such tasks in my other systems, specifically CAF4 and DECAF.<br><br>Tasks that I identify as part of a simple project or contexts are entered individually into my FVP list preceded by a project or context name.  For example of contexts,<br><br>Call Roger re: tickets<br>Call Sis re: picking up kids<br>Call Michael re: mail pick-up<br><br>where "Call" are all tasks which (obviously) entail using a phone to call people.  In the same vein, "Buy" and "Go to" are for errands, "Email" is obvious, and "Web" is for anything else relating to the internet.  Project names I usually just enclose in slashes, like<br><br>/E-Leave/ fix passport<br>/E-Leave/ buy tickets<br><br>So when a project or context task is selected in FVP as the task I want to do now, and yet I also want to do other same-context tasks, I: <br><br>> Rewrite that project/context task at the end of the list WITHOUT deleting the task from where it was originally<br>> Scan the list for other in-context tasks<br>> Rewrite those tasks at the end of the list and delete them<br>> Join the rewritten tasks with a single bracket at the left<br>> The bracketed tasks are then treated as a single task per rules of FPV<br>> Delete the original task per rules of FPV<br><br>Please note that I do not join same project and context tasks indiscriminately. Rather, I join tasks that I judge that I can do all in one sitting or would make the accomplishment of the tasks easier.  Also, I never have had more than one set of bracketed tasks at a time.<br><br>Usually I mark and do the bracketed tasks right away.  Sometimes though I do not, and the problem becomes that sometimes when I get to doing those tasks I have to add some more to them.  Fortunately I am using a rather wide notebook and I just write those additional tasks to the right side.</div>

<div class="content">Interesting idea, I will give this a try.<br><br>And this I can use right now:   use /slashes/ for projects.   I've been using [brackets] but /slashes/ are so much faster to write!   :-)</div>
