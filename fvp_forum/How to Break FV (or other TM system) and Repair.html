<div class="content">The first week went fairly well. The first things I threw at it were my weekly list and my "sometime, hopefully soon" list. My "wish I did yearly" list ended up somewhere in the middle, easy to ignore. All was well. Then I tried an electronic method, and sorted by the date each task was first put on any list.<br><br>You guessed it. All those "wish I did yearly" tasks were on top. Each one takes several hours. None has a firm deadline.<br><br>Option 1: Create a chain. When I reach the oldest task, work on it just a bit, copy it to the end, make a new chain starting with another of the old long tasks. Result: Way too many high-resistance tasks started and left in the middle.<br><br>Option 2: Do even less before rewriting. Result: The same bunch of stubborn tasks at the end of the list, only now with several easier tasks between them. Then those easier tasks get done, and we're back to where we started.<br><br>Option 3: Preferred. Move all those tasks to a project with the title "Wish I did Yearly". Write "Work on Wish I Did Yearly project" at the end of the FV list. When I pick one and start it, change that to "Wish I Did Yearly project -- Task 1". This keeps the entire project in mind, but focuses on one step at a time.<br><br>Lesson: Putting too many steps from one project in the FV list is not recommended. It's also easy to recover from.</div>

<div class="content">Cricket: I agree with your option 3, one just has to set a reminder to look in the other storage location, then haul it out if one feels so inclined.<br><br>i'm using Evernote with one FV List and tags to set up the chain when processing.  FV list is one of a few notebooks under the FV "Stack", others include:<br>Routines (separate lines for Daily, Weekly, Monthly etc, copy the check list item from under the relevant entry and paste into FV List)<br>Reminders (I prefer having a calendar alarm for really critical stuff)<br>LTBW (Let The B*****d Wait)<br>Completed<br><br>Yep, FV is the best since the heady days of AF over three years ago.</div>
