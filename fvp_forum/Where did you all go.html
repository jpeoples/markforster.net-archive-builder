<div class="content">Evidently everybody jumped on the flavor of the month, "No List".  Is this just because it it trending (Mark being the trend setter) or did you find problems with the practice of FVP?  <br><br>For myself I haven't been running any system (no list!) except for a journalling method that combines what I need to do with notes on what I am doing or have done. But only for my main projects.  Other stuff has been neglected, and at some point Im inclined to return to FVP to pick those things up again.</div>

<div class="content">For me, FVP is a good system, but it tears down my willpower pretty quickly as each day goes on. Every decision I have to make makes my next decision harder. So each item I compare on a FVP list is a new decision, with the next comparison being harder than the last. Luckily the algorithm funnels the selections together so there are less comparisons to make as you use it. <br><br>Still FVP would leave me mentally drained at the end of the day, and unfortunately I work at night!</div>

<div class="content">I didn't have any specific problems with FVP.   And I still use the algorithm all the time for rough prioritization of various things.<br><br>But I'm finding the no-list mentality is even more effective than FVP.   It's really driving a lot of improvements in the way I work.<br><br>It's hard to nail down how this phenomenon actually works.   In the moment, it really does feel ad-hoc, even a little bit on-the-edge-of-the-cliff.   But at the end of the day, I feel more on top of the work overall, and have better insights into what processes are working, and what aren't.<br><br>Also, no-list also creates a greater sense of focus than FVP.   In effect, the no-list approach is very effective at limiting WIP.  I wrote more about this here:    <a href="../general_forum/5T and limiting WIP.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2578511</a><br><br>FVP (and all the other catch-all systems) are much less effective at limiting WIP.</div>

<div class="content">"Still FVP would leave me mentally drained at the end of the day"<br><br>Jesse summarized it very well for me!<br><br>I am still using Superfocus version 3, I can't believe I didn't try this one all those years ago.  It is an amazing system.</div>

<div class="content">I'm still on my GTD/FV/own ideas hybrid. I tried FVP, everything collapsed, months passed with just chaos, but now I've got a month or so with good results behind me with my old system and going strong.<br><br>Maybe I'll reintroduce the core idea from FVP back into my system later but I'll have to do it carefully. To me, making chains is very high effort because that sort of decisions take a lot of energy. With FVP, those decisions come more often, such that even if there are less of them I have to put myself in that chainmaking mode, in that mindset, and that's not easy.</div>
