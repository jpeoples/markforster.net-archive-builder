<div class="content">Josh!  It means "first in order of list position".   Note that this quote from Mark is intended to "ensure that the early tasks on your list get actioned"  Well, clearly, if you only action really urgent items as you work on your FV list, then you will very, very soon find yourself back at the oldest item on your list.  This is the the point of the strategy.</div>
