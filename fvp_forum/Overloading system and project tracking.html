<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">In the General forum, I was discussing the difficulty of building a chain of tasks when the list is too long.  I had overloaded it on the first day of starting a new system.<br><br>Alan had mentioned that you should keep it short, but he suggested tracking project separately.  However, FVP etc suggest keeping all levels in the system: "Tasks can be added at any level, e.g. Project X, Plan Restructuring, Call Pete, Tidy Desk."<br><br>But Mark also points this out in FVP Additional Tips section:<br><br>"The best way to sink any time management system is to overload it right at the beginning. FVP is pretty resilient, but at this stage you aren’t. So build up the list gradually. My advice is to start off with the tasks and projects that are of immediate concern to you right now, and then add more as they come up in the natural course of things."<br><br>I still want to think about how one project can lead to other projects: how to build on one thing to another, taking steps to make other steps easier (based on ideas from DECAF), doing things based on what type of person you want to be... that kind of thing.</div>

<div class="content">@Mark, have you tried starting the FVP list at the first task entered from yesterday, the idea you came up with recently in regards to AF? I am enjoying the new algorithm starting from there, but not starting from the top.</div>

<div class="content">@Don R:<br><br>On the DECAF side of things, try writing the tasks you have selected on a separate piece of paper, or maybe the back of your notebook, if the list has grown too large for you to leave the marked tasks in it. <br><br>I did add this tip in the earlier incarnation of DECAF, CAF4, I'm sorry I completely forgot to mention it.<br><br>As for projects in FVP: yeah that is going to be tricky, have little experience in it yet, but as Alan said in the other forum try not to mix or change the rules of task management systems so early. Stick to one or the other for now, and when you have had experience with them both then try to mix systems up.</div>

<div class="content">vegheadjones:<br><br><< @Mark, have you tried starting the FVP list at the first task entered from yesterday, the idea you came up with recently in regards to AF? >><br><br>No, I haven't - because it won't work.<br><br><<  I am enjoying the new algorithm starting from there, but not starting from the top. >><br><br>Have you actually tried both methods? If you have you didn't give it much chance to work. You can't judge a system in half a day.<br><br>I would also recommend starting a new list for the system. As I say in the instructions that is not because the system isn't resilient enough to cope with a long list, but because you aren't resilient enough at this stage.</div>

<div class="content">I would like to stress a point which I have made over and over again during the last seven years. Give a new system a fair trial as it is written BEFORE you make your own alterations. Otherwise you are never actually using the system as it is intended to be used.</div>

<div class="content">I just wanted to wrap things up by saying that now that I've had a chance to start FVP, my supposedly long list is not actually that bad at all. When I had started discussing it, it was before FVP had been released.<br><br>Instead of not wanting to build a chain, it was somewhat enjoyable. Skipping over less desired items and choosing better ones must be something I'm good at. :)<br><br>I noticed an interesting phenomenon. When I come to an item for which it is best to "strike while the iron is hot" I choose it right away. For example, if I wanted to ask someone about something, and they are available now, it fits right into the rules to do it right now. So it is very responsive to taking the best opportunities when they are available.</div>
