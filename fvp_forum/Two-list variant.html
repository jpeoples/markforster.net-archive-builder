<div class="content">I find this works really well for me.  It keeps my FV list spritely, relevant, and under 20 items:  I follow the rules of FV, with the following difference:<br><br>When I finish a task, I consider whether I can delete it, put it away, or should get back to it soon.  If my answer is to put it away (because I mustn't forget it, but there's no call in the near future to address it), I move the task to list 2.<br><br>One of the tasks on my main list is to review list 2.  When I review it, I grab any tasks that need doing soon and bring them back to the FV list. I delete any tasks that aren't needed. I merge any duplicates.<br><br>The only other thing I do sometimes is group things into projects tracked elsewhere. There are no rules about such.</div>

<div class="content">I like the idea of a "parking lot" for items like this. In fact, calling it a "parking lot" sort of removes any activity related to calling it a "list".</div>

<div class="content">I like this idea.  I have a large dry-erase board in my home office, and this might be a good plase to "park" those items.  This may work for an issue I brought up in another post, that is how to deal with items that I can't do now due to the crappy weather we have this time of year.<br><br>Thanks!</div>

<div class="content">Sounds like a good variation. My big list is a frustrating mix. The older pages are fine -- only dismissed items are on them -- but most of the list is so mixed-up I need to pull out tasks each day to focus on.</div>

<div class="content">I've been trying to use Evernote as a kind of parking lot.  I write thoughts, capture meeting notes, notes from phone calls, web clippings, etc.  I like how notes jump to the top of your list whenever they are edited -- it keeps the freshest items on top.   <br><br>I scan through the notes from time to time, making edits sometimes, maybe just deciding what to keep, what to archive, what to delete.   It's not a "to do" list at all - more of an "idea list" or a journal or a notebook of things to consider.   There may be action items in there somewhere, but I don't try to flag them in any special way.   I just try to cycle through the active notes from time to time.    Sometimes I also look through my older, archived notes.   I'm trying not to give it too much thought so it doesn't turn into some kind of master system.  :-)</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br>Do you mark up active tasks in some way, such as with an "Active" tag or by using an "Active" notebook? Or do you just rely on active tasks rising to the top?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark - <br><br>I just rely on active tasks rising to the top.   Or, to be more precise, I rely on the active NOTES rising to the top, because there may or may not be any actual tasks in there.   Maybe they are meeting notes, or ideas, or half-written proposals, etc.</div>

<div class="content">How do you handle "must do's", including "must re-read meeting notes to see if any must-do's are hiding in them"?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Cricket -- I'm not sure whom you are asking, but here is what I do.   I scan the Evernote notes from time to time to review what's in there.   I usually do this when I am sitting and waiting for something - waiting in the car to pick up my son after baseball practice, or waiting for my next meeting at work to start, or something like that.   If I notice something I really need to do that I have forgotten about, then I might copy it from Evernote and email it to myself.   Or maybe I'll just type into the note, "do this!" (causing the note to float to the top of my Evernote list).<br><br>But usually I'll handle things like that in the regular course of things.   I have my volunteer work on my mind pretty often, and in the evenings when everyone is in bed I'll put "volunteer work" on SMEMA and look through all my papers and emails and meeting notes and just deal with anything that needs to be done.  Or if some particular task is on my mind then that will go on SMEMA.  During working hours, I'll be thinking about my work projects and handle them in the same way.<br><br>With DIT, I would just write everything in DIT.   If I had meeting notes to review, I'd write "review meeting notes" and I'd get to it eventually, if not the next day.   <br><br>I felt more methodical when using DIT, but feel more engaged using SMEMA.</div>

I can understand how ideas you are developing and proposals you are working on rise to the top. But meeting notes? How do they rise unless you are editing them in some way?</div>

<div class="content">I believe I'm doing roughly the same thing using Any.DO.  My parking lot is the SOMEDAY list and I review it each morning. <br><br>I keep the TODAY list "spritely, relevant, and under 20 items" (way under 20 items). I mark must-do items in red, and keep a 3T list at the top.<br><br>I'm using Any.DO on my iPhone and as a Google Chrome extension - they sync.</div>

<div class="content">Mark - I suppose I usually make some edits to the notes, and that's why they float to the top.</div>
