<div class="content">I've got my video demo of FV done at last! It's pretty big - about 70MB and 13 minutes long - and covers an entire working day.<br>It's at <br><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8227179/FV.mov" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8227179/FV.mov</a> <br>for those who want to "watch" me use the system through 7 cycles.</div>

<div class="content">Tom-<br>Thanks! I used Keynote for the video. You could get the same effect with PowerPoint or any other presentation software that exports to video.</div>

<div class="content">I tried to watch this on my iPhone but it says no. Have you thought about posting it on YouTube which allows for playing on more types of devices? I'm sure Dropbox has a limit eventually on downloads as well.</div>

<div class="meta">2012-04-4 15:14</div>
<div class="content">Don (and Mark) - I will YouTube it so it's got a more durable link (because I'm sure to delete it in a DropBox purge at some point) and post the link once that's done.<br><br>All - thanks for the compliments! :^)</div>

<div class="content">Sarah, what a wonderful demo, with whay comes across as 'real life' eg ticking off items during a scan that were 'just done' without being on any ladder.<br><br>It shows to me that there is a tendency in FV towards shorter, doable, less forbidding lists/ladders.  The simplicity which Mark has brought into FV is very well illustrated in your demo.<br><br>I noted one task 'the ladder is not a closed list', at least that's what I think it said.  Your reasoning, or is it a rhetorical question?<br><br>Once again, thanks you very much.</div>

<div class="meta">2012-04-4 16:27</div>
<div class="content">Roger - that was a question for myself, as I was trying to figure out exactly how FV fit into the concepts from Mark's other systems. I don't recall exactly what prompted it; I think it had to do with how to deal with urgent items. Just one of those passing thoughts that gets jotted down and probably deleted without ever resulting in any actions.</div>

<div class="content">Great job, Sarah!<br><br>I am wondering about the wording though of "Do I want to do this before ..." that appears in the scanning box. I hate to be picky, but the wording was a central point earlier, and I wouldn't want to throw newcomers astray. Could the box read "What do I want to do before ..."?</div>

<div class="meta">2012-04-5 13:44</div>
<div class="content">Bernie,<br>Hrm. I've been thinking of it this way:<br>"What do I want to do before [last marked task]?" is the OVERARCHING question.<br>But as I pass through the list, I'm reading each task and weighing it in relation to that last marked task, so the question (or really more the thought - it's not like I compare tasks in grammatically correct sentences) that I consider as I read each subsequent task is whether I want to do that particular task before the last marked one.<br><br>I'm more than willing to believe that I've misinterpreted Mark's intentions, though, and it would be easy enough to change. Mark? Am I completely off base? If you're going to use this as a teaching tool, it should accurately reflect the system as you intended it.</div>

<div class="content">Sarah,<br><br>I think that Bernie is remembering Mark's post here:<br><br><a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/fv-forum/post/1759452#post1760206" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/fv-forum/post/1759452#post1760206</a><br><br>In that post Mark says that the question "what do I want to do before I do x?" allows for scanning the list quickly during selection, instead of pausing at each item to deliberate about it.<br><br>Thanks for creating and posting the demo!</div>

<div class="meta">2012-04-6 5:30</div>
<div class="content">Yes, isinger, that's the one.<br><br>Sarah, I completely get why the video works better the way you've phrased it, and it leads to a great visualization of FV in action.<br><br>I just thought I should point it out since this exact wording difference had been discussed, with Mark's emphasis, and it seemed to affect the outcome for some people. Newbies who don't geek out on these forums will miss the subtlety and might miss out on the scanning effect.</div>

<div class="content">Seriously. Have you ever tried to put drops in a cat's ears and then swab them out with a cotton swab?<br><br>The only thing worse is trying to give the cat nasal saline. *That* is to be avoided at all costs.</div>

<div class="content">My son has wanted to try that for years, though his design calls for peanut butter.</div>
<h2>Reply by Seraphim</h2>
<div class="meta">2012-04-15 1:46</div>
<div class="content">The peanut butter solution does work, but is less efficient since the cats tend to lick it off faster, thus falling to the ground prematurely.</div>

<div class="content"><<With the right paperwork, we could probably get a government grant to further the research.>><br>Indeed, if we stuck a treasury bill to the peanut butter, it might keep the currency afloat forever.</div>

<div class="content">It's possible that I'm too picky, but the low-res-ness of the previous version of the demo was driving me crazy, so I posted a hi-res version. <br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv1Om3As1Ck" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv1Om3As1Ck</a><br><br>(Yes, I know.

<div class="content">I'm not sure how much better it is, to be honest. I think some of the loss is happening on YouTube's end. So here's the same thing from my dropbox:<br><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8227179/FV-HQ.mov" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8227179/FV-HQ.mov</a></div>

<div class="content">Sarah, that's a great video.  You're right, there does seem to be some quality loss on the YouTube side, but your HQ version is much more readable than the original YouTube upload.  It might be better to delete the original version?  It's very difficult to read the text.<br><br>Not to nitpick, but there's a slight error in the video, which somehow survived your rewording of the question.  In the 7th ladder, at 10:58, you select "sweep kitchen" as the next task, but when you resume scanning, you're still asking what you want to do before reading, when it should be what you want to do before sweeping.  Not sure it's worth the hassle to correct it, but I thought I'd make a note of it.<br><br>I thought Mark's FV instructions were clear, but this video is still a great learning tool.</div>
