<div class="content">Hi all, <br><br>Been a while since I've been here, but Todoist just added functionality for custom sort, including by date added.<br><br>Could interest those of you looking to do Mark's methods on digital? <br><br>Just sending out for your interest. <br><br>Tron</div>

<div class="content">You can always just number each item and have it sort by name. Works with any todo app.<br><br>You could even add "page" numbers, so e.g.:<br><br>1.10 respond to email<br>1.11 clear backlog<br><br>would then be line numbers 10 and 11 on page 1,<br><br>2.01 first task on page 2<br><br>and so on.</div>

One advantage of that is for "crossing out and adding to end of list" - here you'd only have to change to a new number.</div>

<div class="content">I've been using Todoist for my version of FV, which is to make an FV list of things I want to get <br>done this week, and a second list of things I want to get done today (which then get time blocked).<br><br>I use the filters (paid version) to see the correct lists, and priorities to indicate them to be selected. As you note, sort by creation date allows there to be a long list MF style, but as important to me is that when you use the "duplicate task" function, it gives it a creation date of today and goes to the end of the chronological list, allowing you to practice "little and often" and get a good clumped list.</div>

<div class="content">25 lines for a page. Why? Thatâ€™s the number of lines my favorite paper notebook has ðŸ˜€</div>

<div class="content">Not preserving created date was an issue with most list applications in the past.<br><br>Microsoft's task and To Dos were a rare exception, and it's always good to welcome another major app into the fold.<br><br>I find Microsoft To Do works rather well for FV. Swiping a task into "MyDay" effectively dots it for action. Very quick and easy.<br><br>Having said which, I use a notebook and pen at the moment.</div>
