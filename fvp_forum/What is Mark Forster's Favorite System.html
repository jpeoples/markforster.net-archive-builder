<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">I am reading Mark Forster's "Secrets of Productive People". In the book, Mark says that that the "Simple Time Management System" described on page 55 (hereafter "the Simple System") is the time management system that he finds "...works the best". So, does that mean the Mark thinks that the Simple System works better the FVP? Or FV? Or is the Simple system just a simplified version of FV or FVP (for the "layperson"- the books' readership)? <br><br>Please clarify.<br><br>Thank You.</div>

<div class="content">Mark T:<br><br>The book was written before FVP was developed.</div>

<div class="content">Finally, I bought ebook of "Secrets of Productive People" from Google Play Books. Purchasing ebooks from Malaysia via Google is much easier than via Amazon. The sample first 18 pages was good. Looking forward to reading the rest 266 pages of it, and shedding different light on FVP.  :-)</div>

<div class="content">sabre23t:<br><br>I don't want to disappoint you, but the book is not about FVP. Insofar it's about time management systems at all (one chapter out of 50) it's about no-list.</div>
