<div class="content">If you are using Alternative FV as your sole system please share your thoughts about it.<br>Am I weak-willed for sticking with Standard FV?  Am I less productive if I use Standard FV?</div>

<div class="content">I dare not even try.  It's hard enough doing stuff easy to hard.  Starting with the hard is a recipe for procrastination.  Plus, I would have a hard time distinguishing between "resisting more" and "this really isn't ready to be worked on" making even the selection process a pain.</div>

<div class="content">A speculation I haven't tested is that there are 2 reasons a task is procrastinated over and so 2 separate approaches are optimal:<br><br>i) a task needs postponing/delaying until circumstances are more favourable or one feels more ready <br>ii) a task is being avoided due to fear and anxiety<br><br>An experiment would be to run 2 separate FV lists for the 2 cases, or maybe an AF list for postponement or tasks that evaporate away for some reason (dismissal) and an FV list for tasks being avoided, probably due to what might be termed "approach anxiety" -  lack of confidence or trust that one has the skiils or ability to manage our "inner game"<br><br>The FV list would then be an anxiety reducer, progressively desensitizing one to the more challenging tasks. The AF list serves to make explicit the postponement decisions.</div>

<div class="content">Also count overwhelm and lack of energy and enthusiasm and mild depression. It's fall again. Here that's the real start of the year. School starts after two months off. Every hobby group has general meetings. Businesses start full speed again. I had two great weeks, half of last week was great. This week? Well, I have three days to rescue it.</div>
