<div class="content">I have tested almost all Mark systems since Autofocus 1, electronically and not, and I must admit they all crumbled in less than 3 months.<br>So it may be a little too soon to praise FV since I began yesterday but I remarked very interesting things.<br><br>- I really feel like really MANAGING my time and being on top of it (while I always felt lost, fearing of missing things with other systems)<br>- The process is fun! Creating chains is fun! Because you always put fun tasks before the hard ones. And the genius of it is that when you have done 3 or 4 easy tasks and you have only this ugly last task to do to finish the chain, YOU FINALLY DO IT! Or at least a little, and without too much resistance since you want to create another chain quickly! Brilliant.<br>- This is very simple to use(the AF systems were apparently simple but weren't), and it helps to solve procrastination and priority problems efficently!<br><br>I can say I love this system, and since I don't feel resistance to use it, it looks like a sustainable one (which is the main problem of all the systems I used until now). A system should work on autopilot, and don't ask for willpower to be maintained (like forcing weekly reviews you know...)<br><br>I hope I will say the same thing in a few months.</div>

<div class="content">I must add I don't feel the need to tweak the system. This may be the best improvement!!<br><br>Btw I am using Wunderlist and it works not so bad... the order of tasks are sometimes changed which is not really acceptable but they seem they may fix this in the future.</div>

<div class="content">I use the system for 1 week now, and this is the first time I use a system that makes me do all the tasks. There is no dismissing (there have been 1 dismissing but this was not something I really wanted to do, and I didn't feel quite good putting it on the list in the first place but I did it anyway to see what would happen).<br>At the same time I can say the resistance is low for most tasks.<br>The only effect I observed is that I must allow me pauses (acting freely without any system, on written tasks or others) unless I would feel overly stressed ticking tasks all day.<br>In a way it teaches me where are my concentration limits (and they are low ^^; but the system helps me to manage them)</div>

<div class="content">I've been using it per the instructions since the beginning.  It's the reason I'm still getting stuff done.  Hardly miss a deadline (as was the norm in the past).  <br><br>Before FV, my list used to hover around 150-175 items.  For many weeks this spring and early summer it was around 90-110.  Lately I've seen numbers in the 40s.  It makes no sense since the workload seems to be increasing.  More, harder, stuff to do and getting done.</div>
