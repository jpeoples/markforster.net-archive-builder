<div class="content">Currently:<br><br>• Using FastFVP<br>• Using the questions: "Now?" and "Next?". <br><br>Testing this new question combo. It seems to be speeding up and focusing my use of FastFVP if anyone else is interested in trying it. I'm looking for a combo that comes as close as possible to the standing-out method.<br><br>January 19, 2017 at 2:16 | Michael B.<br><br><br>Michael B:<br><br>I think I like the sound of "Now?" and "Next?" better than my two questions. Now to try them out!<br><br>January 19, 2017 at 9:18 | Mark Forster<br><br><br>Mark:<br><br>Used it all day Wednesday. So far this pairing feels light on the mind. Both questions are very easy to run in the background while scanning. It seems to produce a very intuitive and relaxing cadence to it that reminds me of Autofocus. Anyone that would like to give it a try:<br><br>1. Standard FastFVP Rules<br>2. Ask "Now?". If the task feels ready now, do it.<br>3. If not now, ask "Next?" and continue scanning through the list for a task that you want to do next.<br>4. When a task stands out, dot it and ask "Now?".<br>5. Continue on using the FastFVP process.<br><br>January 19, 2017 at 11:05 | Michael B.<br><br><br>Michael B:<br><br>I tried it for a short time but came across a problem with the question "Next?"<br><br>Next to what?<br><br>If means next to the task which you have just decided doesn't feel ready, the question would be "First?", not "Next?"<br><br>If it means next after the task you have last done, then you are not comparing it with the right benchmark.<br><br>The mental disorder caused by this was sufficient for me to abandon the attempt and seek clarification.<br><br>I tried using "Now?" and "First?" but somehow that doesn't have the same ring to it!<br><br>January 19, 2017 at 15:46 | Mark Forster</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br>My initial thought for the question pair was "Now?" and "Next Hour?". As in "What do I want to do in the next hour?". <br><br>I wanted a pair that would tighten the time frame of the task chain, speed up the scanning process even further and be memorable and light on the mind.<br><br>It was immediately apparent though that all sequencing and order is lost with that implied meaning, so later it became "What do I want to do more in the next hour?".<br><br>This didn't seem to produce the effect I was looking for so then I shortened it to "Next?". As in "Okay, what do I want to do next?". <br><br>When a task stood out I'd dot it, and per the FastFVP process would double-check with "Now?". <br><br>So in a sense, this newly dotted task stands out more than the previous task as something I want to do "next", but not necessarily as something I want to do "now". In a subtle way, it seemed to produce the effect of the questionless, standing-out method but with a little more mental guidance, and seemed to lightly sequence the tasks.</div>

<div class="content">Michael B:<br><br>Thanks for the clarification. I've just started on a new super-fabulous highly effective system that is the answer to everything (at least in my fevered imagination), so I won't be able to retest your system until said super-fab etc system proves to be nothing of the sort. <br><br>Of course I mean "unless" not "until"</div>

<div class="content">Good luck with this new system, Mark.  We're spoiled for choice with all these great new systems; it's like being a kid in a sweet-shop - what do I choose? - they all look good!  <br><br>Since Christmas I've been using a new technique (new to me) to really focus my attention on doing only the essentials in pursuit of a particular goal or commitment, so that I don't get sidetracked or hijacked - that's a good title for it.  It applies from the micro to the macro level.  It's still a bit of a hazy notion, and I don't know how well I'll be able to articulate it,  but I'll submit a post on it soon.</div>
