It's good because it gets an orderly room very quickly.  It may be bad because you can end up with a pile of stuff that doesn't get put back, and what do you do with it?  Of course that stuff otherwise would have been irreconcilable clutter in that other room, but it's still a problem.</div>

<div class="content">I am with Jupiter on this.  This is something I am actually good at since I accumulate lots of things very quickly.  I travel back and forth to the West every year, and usually I do not have a choice but to get rid of most everything before taking off again.<br>(1)  First, I make receptacles.  Either I have, or go buy, little plastic drawers (small, medium, large), and keep an inventory of basic categories in front of me or on the wall.<br>(3)  I cut little pieces of paper and write each category on them, and spread them around the room, or garage.<br>(4)  I throw ever single thing I have on the floor.<br>(5)  I start with one corner - working my way out.  I do not deal with anything in the middle, or randomly  - I only work my way out from the corner.  <br>(6)  One problem area is things that are "worth something".  These go in the eBay, charity or to-be-dealt with stack.<br>(7)  Another problem is the sentimental stuff - like things from your parents or from your childhood.  If I choose not to keep something, I pull out the iPhone and take a photo of it, and then ditch it (painfully).<br>(8)  If you haven't used something in the last year or so, get rid of it.  <br>(9)  The other sticky point is papers; like that project or procedures that took so long to get right and you just might have to do a similar project like that in the future.  You got to have a to-be-scanned stack and use EverNote or something similar.<br>(10)  Once you see the cleaned-up area migrate out from the corner, it gives you momentum to continue on.</div>

<div class="content">I used to move every four months, as a co-op student, often between cities. At first my home base was with my parents, but over the years that shifted to school. I'd start at one end of the room, pack, toss, or put in storage box, what I could that pass, leaving undealt-with stuff in my wake. The first pass was important stuff (jewellery, documents). Then a few passes of big objects. The final pass was usually a box of "No time left. It will all fit in this box, so no harm to bring."<br><br>That was in the collecting phase of my life. I could ship stuff to my parents, or rent more storage at residence. Then the residence said, "Congratulations graduate, you're no longer entitled to storage," and my parents moved to a smaller house. (I dread the day "box from basement" works its way to first unactioned item.)</div>

<div class="content">I wish I had the space available to set aside the piles, however, I just had the uselessgarage converted into a new home office with shower/toilet and small lobby.<br><br>My loft/attic space was more or less divided into the correct piles - Ditch, Donate, Sell, Keep - but our younger son has moved back in and his junk is all over the loft.<br><br>"Unfortunately" my work takes me to foreign climes and I'm not at home often enough between assignments to make inroads.  I will need more than a week to get everything done, with said younger son helping, will have to schedule that week later this year, if possible.<br><br>Note to my LTBW List: Re-tidy loft, be ruthless with designated piles, in in doubt, Ditch.</div>

<div class="content">I am with Jupiters method too, though I clear it in 2 passes.<br><br>First pass to 'bin' things into say a pile of paperwork, clothes, bag of rubbish, recycling, container of odd bits and so on.<br><br>Then a second pass to sort each of the piles etc in turn. This takes longer than the first pass but at least things are 'contained' by then and not in a random mess! :¬)</div>
