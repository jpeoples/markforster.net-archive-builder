<div class="content">I am a veteran list maker, GTD, procrastinator, etc. etc. etc. I think the best part of FV is that you look at your list all the time, you touch it, you pay attention to it on a daily basis. <br><br>I have tons of lists on NOZBE but don't look at it very often and my lists are overwhelming. Everyonce in a while I take a peek to see if I've forgotten something important. I would love to be up to date. This causes me a lot of stress.<br><br>Check out NOZBE for FV. You can star items, you can drag and drop, I am going to go back to NOZBE with a FV attitude and see if I can feel better!<br><br>NOZBE - <a href="http://www.nozbe.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.nozbe.com/</a></div>

<div class="content">Nozbe seems to sync task order across devices well. (Testing with web app and Mac app). Unlike Wunderlist, which seems to randomize...</div>

<div class="content">I came here just to see if anyone was using Nozbe for FV--I'll hope you'll post an update, Susanna! I've used it in the past and liked it (I even signed up for the affiliate program: <a href="http://webapp.nozbe.com/a-B97AF1A63)," target="new" rel="nofollow">http://webapp.nozbe.com/a-B97AF1A63),</a> but I didn't see quite how to use it for FV.<br><br>I didn't realize till I read your post that tasks could be dragged and dropped--that seems the essential element for making it work!<br><br>Nozbe is free for up to five projects, but most of us FV-ers will keep most tasks on a single FV "project" (list), so that should be fine.<br><br>I love that it syncs across devices. But I wish it handled un-done tasks automatically--maybe we should drop a note to the developer and see if that's something he could implement.<br><br>Any other Nozbe users???</div>

<div class="content">I (partially) caved in. Created a free Nozbe account. Created a project called "FV". Created about 10+ actions items. Each item have a created date, can have a due date, but doesn't seem to show an updated date. Doesn't seem to have a way to view the actions items sorted by created/updated date.<br><br>So this *newbie* Nozbe user thinks Evernote Desktop/Android would be better/easier for FV than Nozbe web app.</div>

<div class="content">Agreed. Despite my earlier semi-rave. Nozbe seems to sort differently on different devices--and that makes it a no-go for me.</div>
