<div class="content">Hi,<br><br>What do usually do or what is your approach when your dotted task (next action) is sort of project? <br><br>For example, I have my next action task: Develop old b&w films, but for me it is not so easy task because I don't remember how to do this, I need to buy some chemicals, set up my darkroom again etc. <br><br>Should I cross the main taks out and re-enter it at the end of the list with its action steps? And than should I go to the next dot? Or should I put dot to the first action step? Not sure about it.<br><br>Thank you in advance</div>

<div class="content">I think you can either (1) do one of those small things you said, such as buying chemicals or setting up your dark room, or (2) write those actions you identified at the end of the list. In either case, you have done something related to your dotted task (in 1, a small step; in 2, identified a small step). After that, you should probably go to your next dotted task (well, if it makes sense to --- say, you have set up your dark room but do not need to use it straight away).<br><br>The idea behind all Mark's system is the "little and often" approach -- a task counts as done if a small step was made toward it, even if that was only to think of how one should go about doing it. If more of the task needs to be done, just cross it and re-add it (or a rewritten version of it) to the end of your list.</div>

<div class="content">What I am doing is having the project name on the list, but having separate sheets elsewhere with a detailed list of activities. If I decide to work on the project, I access the project sheet or file and do one or more of the activities listed there. Once I have done as much as I want to do, I can re-enter the project name at the end of my list.</div>
