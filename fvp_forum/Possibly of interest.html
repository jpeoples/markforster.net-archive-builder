<div class="content">I came across this via a newsfeed.<br><br>https://kanbanflow.com/<br><br>I tried to get colleagues interested in a kanban approach a couple of years ago to manage project outputs, but I was not successful in persuading them and dropped it myself.<br><br>I know some forum members have mentioned knban and a few may use it as well as FV, AF, DWM etc.<br><br>I'm sticking with FV via Evernote for now, I may look at this in my next foreign assignment next month.</div>
