<div class="content">The main problem with FV is that not all tasks are created equal.  Some tasks are not worthy enough to be reviewed multiple times till it gets on top to be dismissed.<br><br>My theory is that Mark also discovered this and that is why he has abandoned this site.</div>

<div class="content">Or he might just have better things to do. <br><br>He certainly hasn`t abandoned the site - he continues to fund it and allow us to discuss the endless tweaks we like to make ad infinitum.   <br><br>Anyways, I find that FV is a very good system and if he has chosen this as his last system, then he certainly has made a significant contribution to all of us.  Retiring on a high note is pretty classy.<br><br><br>.</div>

<div class="content">"The truth":<br><br>"The main problem with FV is that not all tasks are created equal." <br><br>... That is not the main problem with FV nor is that a problem at all.<br><br><br>"Some tasks are not worthy enough to be reviewed multiple times till it gets on top to be dismissed."<br><br>... All tasks you have committed to doing are worthy enough to be reviewed multiple times until you DO THEM. If it's on your FV list you have committed to doing it. There is no dismissal in FV.<br><br><br>"My theory is that Mark also discovered this and that is why he has abandoned this site."<br><br>... You're not a very skilled analyst then. You've received FV and loads of solid advice for years for free; Mark has a wife, children, a family, errands, things to plan, a retirement to enjoy, holidays, summer travel, and a list of tasks that don't involve this FREE website.<br><br>"The truth", is that your powers of observation are lacking and your comment is buoyant with smugness.</div>

<div class="content">>Some tasks are not worthy enough to be reviewed multiple times till it gets on top to be dismissed.<br><br>why can't you dismiss a task anywhere on the list when you realize it's dismiss-able? I do that whenever I notice it, it helps keep the list manageable.</div>

<div class="content">I don't believe there is a flaw in fv, just a flaw in how we use it. It's occurred to me that in previous systems Mark has stressed that AF and it's variations should be used for discretionary and unscheduled time. Not necessarily for the whole work-day.<br><br>I've mentioned before that I tend to use a variation of AF2 when I know what I want to get through that day or part of day.<br><br>If you take the view that all the tasks on your list need to be done at some point (or kicked off the list if they don't) then I've not seen a more coherent system for actually eating through the list. Your tasks are the same whatever system you use, you just need to use the right tool at the right time.<br><br>But no system will help if you continually overload yourself with commitments.</div>

<div class="content">Mark has taught me a lot. I no longer use any of his systems, but the following ideas continue to influence my own workflow: <br><br>* little and often<br>* working on tasks/projects that "stand out"<br>* some form of dismissal <br>* pen/paper vs computer<br><br>I'm also curious what happened to Mark, and if he still uses FV, AF...  If he is writing a book, I hope it's a synthesis of his ideas, and not so much a "how to" re: FV. Either way, I'll purchase as a token of support.</div>

<div class="content">Avrum,<br><br>I too am curious as to what Mark is doing, I certainly hope he is enjoying his retirement.  There comes a time when I think we all realize a TM system is only as good as the user and the will and motivation to get things accomplished can trump or derail any system.<br><br>That said, I am curious what you are using if you abandoned Mark's methods.<br><br>Thanks<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">I think "the truth"'s speculations about Mark's absence are grossly unfair.<br><br>Awhile ago Mark said he was very busy.   He was also spending time with family.   Good for him!   Though he made a career out of time management, I always had the impression his life is much bigger than time management.   "The truth" is reading an awful lot into his absence.<br><br>All of Mark's systems have had tradeoffs and emphasized different sets of features.   Mark was usually among the first to identify the shortcomings in his own systems, but that never led him to "quit and go away".  On the contrary, since the introduction of AF1, it led to more than three years of incredible creativity, productivity, and development and sharing of a series of insights into what makes time management work.   <br><br>Gerry asked - "I am curious what you are using if you abandoned Mark's methods"<br><br>I started a new thread on the General forum to discuss this:  <a href="../general_forum/What you are using if you abandoned Mark's methods.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1913954</a></div>

<div class="content">"The main problem with FV is that not all tasks are created equal. Some tasks are not worthy enough to be reviewed multiple times till it gets on top to be dismissed."<br><br>So delete them from the list whenever you decide that they aren't worth looking at. For me, this happens to one or two tasks during every preselection cycle - it's a natural byproduct of using the list as a "grasscatcher" - you are going to write down some things that were passing fancies and then the structured procrastination of system gives you time to realize that rather than tilting at those windmills right away.<br><br>I, too, will pile on the "hope Mark is doing well" bandwagon.</div>

<div class="content">... In a post from April 28, 2008 ( <a href="../general_forum/Are you okay Mark.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/411484</a> ) the question was asked:<br><br><br>"Are you okay Mark?"<br><br>Mark's reply:<br><br>"Thanks to everyone who has expressed concern about my wellbeing. I am in fact perfectly ok - just being lazy, which is one of the benefits of being semi-retired!"<br><br>and also:<br><br>"I said I was being lazy, not that I was wasting time.<br><br>Very different things!<br><br>See <a href="../blog/In praise of doing nothing.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2007/5/14/in-praise-of-doing-nothing.html</a> "<br><br><br>I thought it might be appropriate for "The truth" and Johnd to reflect on these shocking (incredible, stunning, remarkable, astounding) replies for a moment.</div>

<div class="content">"abandoned this site" ?? wow, I go away for a week & weeds start to grow.<br><br>@avrum, good list, I'd also add the idea of self inventing, testing, modifying systems</div>

<div class="content">on re-reading my last post i felt that perhaps was too vague. i believe this overall thread from The Truth & comment post of Johnd are rather harsh. perhaps appropriate for another forum, but not here.<br><br>the issues they raise about FV are worth discussing, but the comment towards Mark is whacked.<br><br>by mentioning weeds, it might have seemed i was referring to Mark not tending a garden/site. i was NOT, instead the weeds is the tone of initial post of this thread.</div>

<div class="content">truther wrote:  << Not all tasks are created equal >>  <br><br>That's true, and it's the beauty of Mark's systems that they can handle any size or shape of task that you throw at them.   I think this is a feature, not a bug.<br><br>If you follow the rules of FV, the tasks that are not "worthy" of multiple review (or action) will have likely been deleted long before they make it to the top spot.   And if they didn't get deleted by then, the top-spot-forcing-function forces you to delete them.   It takes about a tenth of a second.</div>
