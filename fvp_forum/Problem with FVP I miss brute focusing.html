<div class="content">I've been experiencing serious resistance issues with some tasks in FVP that I would have no problems with when I was using my other system, DECAF. I think it's because I got used to what I call "brute focusing" (I do not know if there is another name for it).<br><br>In "brute focusing", I choose a hard task, then I scan for and mark tasks (adding new tasks if neesed) that answer the question "What will help me do this hard task?" I then do the marked tasks in any order that I deem fit, as long as I do them all.<br><br>I can reasonably simulate this in FVP but it just feels clunky. I don't know if I should continue FVP or go back to DECAF.</div>

<div class="content">nuntym:<br><br>Are you using a question or the "no question" variation of FVP?</div>

<div class="content">I am currently using the "no question" variant.</div>

<div class="content">nuntym:<br><br>I suggest that you just allow the system to work. Don't try to influence the "standing out" and go for few, rather than many dots. Also pay attention to how you phrase your tasks.<br><br>I've personally found "no question" FVP to be almost completely without resistance - far more so than any other system I've tried. And far more so than FVP with a question.</div>

<div class="content">@Mark Forster:<br><br>I actually went back to my old system a few hours after the OP just to see what was different with what I was doing in DECAF compared to FVP. I have come back to pure vanilla FVP with no question now. Let us see the difference.</div>

<div class="content">It seems that what Seraphim and Mark are currently doing are similar in concept to what I called "brute focusing" in this thread or "context focusing" in CAF and DECAF, so I felt it was appropriate to bring this thread up.<br><br>I remember toying with an idea earlier this year of a tweak of FVP, in which I would<br><br>1) attach a blank piece of paper to the beginning of my FVP notebook (let's say a Post-It), <br>2) scan a task in my list for something I want to focus on, <br>3) delete and rewrite it in the piece of paper, <br>4) process the list as you would with FVP and having the rewritten task as the first task, but with the intention of treating that task as the "current initiative" (as Mark and Seraphim defines it),<br>5) once done the task in the piece of paper is deleted and, if necessary, rewritten at the end of the list,<br>6) go back to step 2,<br>7) change the piece of paper to a clean one the next day or when needed.<br><br>Considering all the hubbub I'll give this a try.</div>

<div class="content">nuntym:<br><br>One could, perhaps, write this on a post-it note and stick it on the first blank page after the end of the list. This way, the end of the list is always bookmarked with the last task/current initiative.</div>

<div class="content">nuntym:<br><br><< process the list as you would with FVP and having the rewritten task as the first task, but with the intention of treating that task as the "current initiative" (as Mark and Seraphim defines it), >><br><br>The problem is that having the "current initiative" as the permanent first task in standard FVP is that the first task is the least accessible position in the list. Michael B's suggestion of having it at the end of the list at least puts it in the most accessible position.<br><br>But my experience so far is that the whole idea of a "current initiative" works best with Reverse FVP.</div>
