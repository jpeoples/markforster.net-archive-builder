<div class="content">Probably I have something missed by the rules: "...Do these in reverse order", which means the last dotted unactioned item is the next one, right?<br>So, if you work on your task chain (backwards) and then a new task comes up in your mind which you don't want to do immediately, but very soon (after you have done the next few task in the chain, e.g. as a reminder) - how do you enter this task. <br>a/ If you enter the task at the end of the list with a dot - so, according to the rules you have to jump back to the list and do it immediately (but you don't want to do it immediately!)<br>b/ If you enter the task at the end of the list without a dot you will probably forget about it, especially if you can't manage to complete the taskchain in an appropriate timeframe...<br><br>How do you handle this?<br>- Jens</div>

<div class="content">Enter without dot, and set a "tickler" in X minutes to remind.</div>

<div class="content">sabre,<br>how to enter a tickler ON PAPER for a timespan smaller than a day/hour? I think this can work with a electronical solution where you can set an reminder...<br>And, I don't want to do the task on an a spezific time - otherwise I would put it on my calendar.<br>Ok, this could be a solution to enter the task as an untimed event on the daily calendar...., hm?!</div>

<div class="content">Follow the rules.  If it's urgent, dot it and do it next.  If it has a deadline, put it on a schedule that will allow you to meet the deadline.  Otherwise, it's likely to get dotted the next time you create a new ladder.<br><br>Just because you "want to do it soon", doesn't mean it's the right thing to do soon.  Let the system decide. <br><br>This is a good reason to keep the ladders relatively short.  Short ladders also helps encourage little and often which some of us struggle with.   They also provide flexibility knowing that you will be going through the list again soon, eases the mind about situations like yours where there isn't a firm deadline.</div>

<div class="content"><< how to enter a tickler ON PAPER for a timespan smaller than a day/hour? >><br><br>Jens, for paper FV, it might be better to have the tickler in whatever alarm/calendar/timer devices available to you. I actually use a small kitchen digital timer. I usually set/default it to 10 or 15 mins.<br><br>So I enter "Task to be done soon but not immediately" undotted to end of FV list. Start timer. Continue with current task. When timer alarm rings, stop/finish/reenter current task and do said "Task to be done".</div>

<div class="content">For reminders, I use Outlook.   Sometimes I set an alarm on my Android phone, if I am away from the computer.<br><br>But if I had to do it with paper, I'd probably just keep a sticky note on the side page, or use it as a bookmark or something, with those hot reminders.    I wouldn't make this a "rule" or a "tweak" -- just something handy, in front of my face, to remind me that I've got to do NNN by a certain time.   I did that with AF sometimes, using a paper notebook.  I'd use a sticky as my placekeeper -- and I'd write urgent reminders of one kind or another on the sticky.<br><br>But if you try to make this into a formal "rule" of some kind, I think you'd be adding needless complexity and overhead.</div>
