<div class="content">For me, this is the most telling data point in FV's favor: the oldest entries in my list have been there for just one week, and I'll likely knock all of those off today.<br><br>With other systems, things would hang on and hang on, get dismissed, hang out there, etc. Now things are either done, calendared or someday/maybe'd (I turned my old dismissed list into a someday/maybe list), or deleted, and that happens pretty quickly.</div>

<div class="content">Yes, this has been one of the most surprising and most exciting FV features for me.  My oldest items are about 3 weeks old.   And as time goes on, the age of the oldest item seems to get smaller and smaller.  It will be interesting to see where it levels out.<br><br>With previous systems, my oldest items would typically be 3+ months old -- together with a backlog of dismissed items going back 6-9 months or more.   Sometimes I would mass-delete those old dismissed items, but sometimes I would find some real nuggets in there that finally seemed ready to do.</div>

<div class="content">My oldest index card is dated November 17, 2011.  That's when I first tried to implement SuperFocus, before switching to my own AutoFocus variant, then FV and now "Prioritized FV" as it were.  I've done very few chains yet because I keep spending hours working on tasks in my preselected list -- I think I need to focus on more "little and often" to finish more chains so I can get things moving better...</div>

<div class="content">2 items from Jan, 1 from Feb, then a bunch from mid-March (when I walked around outside with a list).<br><br>That's impressive, because I imported 20 items from an old list and kept the old, pre-January (some 2 years old!) dates. Only 2 of those 12 were recopied with no visible work being done. One will be combined with a routine task in a few days (adding maybe 10 minutes to the job), and the other couldn't be done because the kids were home. It's also impressive because I restrict myself to one ancient task a day. No matter how important some of the later tasks were, finally making progress on that old list was exciting. I didn't want to do anything before that job that's bugged me for two years!<br><br>I suspect the average age will vary widely with me. I tend to add several high-resistance lines at a time, then go a few weeks adding very little.</div>
