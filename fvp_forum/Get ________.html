<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2012-04-5 20:50</div>
<div class="content">Just thought I'd start a new thread to continue discussion of the "Get _____" approach that GMBW is recommending and some of us are experimenting with. (In the past, Mark has closed a thread that went past 50 comments, as the Task Phraseology one now has.)<br><br>I'm having fun trying to phrase many of the outcomes so that they don't use passive-voice verbs, where possible.  It's easy with things, e.g. "(Get) aspirin."  You don't need an adjective or verb to know when that task is done.<br><br>It's harder with things like exercise.  For example, this morning I wanted to do a P90X Shoulders & Arms (S&A) workout.  I thought about "(Get) S&A worked out" but didn't like the sound of that.  So I asked myself "Why do I want to get/do this?" Then it became obvious – to maintain or improve strength, posture, etc.  So I wrote "(Get) S&A stronger" and, as I was doing the workout, I considered increasing the reps and weight on some of the routines.<br><br>To train myself to this way of approaching task entry, I'm actually writing "get" at the start of each, though GMBW doesn't recommend it. Training wheels are helpful at first.</div>

<div class="content">Hey ubi, I'm glad you opened this thread. The last one by Miracle "task phraseology" was becoming hard to follow.  I had a task on my list - new thread opened. But you did that for me.  <br><br>careful with actually writing get though ( I know you're training yourself, but try to not make it a habit to write it) because soon all your task will look too similar and in my experience it looks too structured to the point you can't really see what's popping put at you. it's good to use the get____ as a guide to just finish the sentence with as few words as possible.</div>

<div class="content">Don't worry. I'm using pencil and just writing "get" lightly above the title line (on my index cards), so when I scan the deck by fanning it out a bit, I still see the nouns first.  When it's time to take the training wheels off, I have an eraser.</div>

<div class="content">How about instead of "get" this or that, we use "don't", and "lose", as in "don't"  get too serious with all the details of what we write down, or we will "lose" all the meaning of what we are trying to accomplish.</div>

<div class="content">For those interested or uncertain what this is all about.  Or asking What's this get business? <br><br>My explanation is found on this thread:<br><a href="../fvp_forum/Task Phraseology How to write it.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/fv-forum/post/1777070</a><br><br>Specifically, it is time stamped:<br>April 4, 2012 at 19:41 <br><br>Interesting comments follow from it. I did not include it here as it would just stretch out the post too much. If you're interested you can check it out.  But, It is basically summarized as this structure for all task phrasing:<br><br>(get) __________<br><br> The (get) is said in the head and the _____is written on paper/recorded on the list with as few words as possible and result oriented. Anything that needs doing can fall in this structure very well. <br><br>It is a guide to write task that  I found works really well and speeds up my flow when doing things. It works for some, but may not work for everyone.  I thought I would share it as I have noticed a lot of others having difficulty with the wording of tasks and incorporating projects into a list etc.  The benefits (from my usage ) are numerous but can be read in more detail on the post above along with examples. <br><br>Admiteddly, it seems very basic/simplistic or even grammatically incorrect at times . Instead of testing it theoretically I suggest actually trying it out.  if it works fr you, and helps with your phrasing of tasks or breaking down projects than great! If it doesn't work for you, that's fine too. some are experimenting with it and it seems as if it has positive results so far.  I'm curious to see if others find any difficulty with it. <br><br>All the best. </div>

<div class="content">Training wheels is right. Back when I read about Next Actions and Contexts and Defining Done, I forced myself to use them all the time. It only lasted a few weeks, but now when a task won't get started, I ask whether those are missing. I got good enough at using those tools that I know when they'll help can use them quickly.<br><br>"Get" seems similar. I'm thinking about "get ahead on", since my current focus is little bites. I used to think there had to be a definable chunk. Do all the weekly cleaning in the bathroom; rewrite on next week's list. Read a chapter. Read the next. I'm trying to allow even less now (or more, like 1.5 chapters). I'm more comfortable starting tasks that I won't be able to finish.<br><br>A really strange result is I do some bits more often. If it wasn't time for the big weekly bathroom clean, I'd ignore the gradual accumulation of spots on the mirror. Now I "work on bathroom" and do what's needed. I might scrub the tub after 6 days, not 7. I might look at it and think "can wait another 2 days" rather than "can't wait another 7". We'll see where that takes me.</div>

I was convinced that I had to do a "whole chunk" at a time and would grow very, *very* irritated if anything interrupted me mid-chunk. I had all sorts of rationalizations as to why I could not come back later, mid-chunk. There would be so much overhead trying to remember where I had stopped, etc.<br><br>But then I read Mark's exhortations and tried little-and-often for real. For the most part, I've found the feared "overhead" isn't bad at all, it frequently leads to novel solutions that occur to me in between sessions, and it has greater overall efficiency (actual work done per running, real-life time) even with these interruptions. In other words, waiting until I feel confident getting an entire chunk finished without interruption is less efficient than doing whatever odd unit of work I can do.<br><br>Usually. There's always the paint-the-kitchen task which you would not want to leave 13.7% finished and just wander away, but it's just not that common. Unless you are a professional kitchen painter.

<div class="content">This topic is making me think about feedback loops, one of the most powerful design patterns ever discovered by humanity.<br><br>The thermostat in your home furnace or air conditioner is a feedback loop: it can maintain your house at a (quite) constant temperature, overcoming unexpected outdoor weather, irregular architecture, even a window left half-open. Today's engineer, spoiled by digital gigahertz processors and gaggles of wireless sensors, might imagine an "expert system" built around complex thermodynamic equations and multivariable input, but fortunately our predecessors had much less to work with.<br><br>And so, their design was:<br><br>GET _____ degrees<br><br>*How* does the machine GET that? By turning on the heat if it's too cold, turning it off if it's too warm. For machines, there is an entire field of whiz-bang theorizing on the details (PID control, nonlinear programming, statistical signal processing ...). Even systems made up of people benefit from these theories.<br><br>But for individual work, our brains quite naturally perceive the difference between the desired outcome and the current situation, and then it is nearly impossible to stop our brains from cooking up possible ways to GET there from here (Mark's "Dreams" system was based on this). Our brains are (at least!) like creative thermostats, capable of formulating their own goal-seeking strategies far beyond "turn the heat off" and "turn the heat on." Most of the time, all we really need is a reliable means of serving up these desired outcomes.<br><br>It's like setting your GPS to your destination coordinates, and letting it recompute a course based on wherever you happen to be; versus writing out turn-by-turn directions in advance, only to find that you are no longer starting from the place you expected.<br><br>None of this tells you how to word your tasks, though. What you need is a "reliable means of serving up desired outcomes." Whether that comes to you via "shed" or "shed painted with outdoor 7-year natural reddish tone before fall," only you can settle it for yourself.<br><br>I am finding it helpful to see how others write these things, because my approach is still hit-or-miss for me. I can speak from experience that "shed" leads me on a wild goose chase. Yet, "shed built" leads me to ignore other options ("shed purchased" ... "shed dropped in favor of underground shelter" ...). My best happy medium so far has been the AF style of listing alternatives and waiting for one to surface first. "Shed" can go on the same list as "shed built by me of lumber" and "shed built by contractor" and "neighbor's shed purchased and moved to my yard."<br><br>The best value I am taking from this discussion right now is to write desired outcomes when I am clear about them. I have recently handled a couple of decision-heavy projects in which I actually regressed once or twice, forgetting what I'd decided earlier, because I wrote the followup task too vaguely. So, I will try "shed built" when I've made a firm decision about that outcome, or when I'm taking the AF-style technique of listing alternate options.</div>

<div class="content">Bernie:<br><br>What's wrong with "Think about shed", or "Decide re shed" or "Investigate sheds"?<br><br>Personally I'd probably just write "Shed?" on the theory that if my wife said "What have you done about the SHED?" I'd know exactly what she meant so I'd probably know what I meant if I said it to myself.<br><br>And if I were a thermostat I'd probably just write "Temp > 22 degrees?" on the theory that being a thermostat I'd know what to do next.</div>

<div class="content">@Mark Forster<br>I didn't think we were arguing at all. :) but yes, the list does seem right. But I wouldn't put the question mark at all. To me it doesn't seem intuitive. I see a question above all.  (for whatever reason, i cant quite explain, I don't want that on my list....personal pref. I guess). If its a question I want to consider later on, suppose I'm having doubts about building a shed, instead of shed? I would put something like: decision about shed. <br><br>I think confusion is coming from my examples or the way I'm describing the structure.  Not sure.

In fact, a previous post from a poster had examples:  'aspirin for headache purchased from store', 'aspirin for headache taken'  whether it was sarcastic or not, it is an excellent example of what I'm not saying to do. I would just put 'aspirin' ! There's no action word necessarily. In other instances there may have been. But in this case, the result would be to just get the aspirin. Not necessarily 'purchase it' since maybe my coworker has one on his desk or maybe theres some in my pantry. Etc.</div>

<div class="meta">2012-04-6 15:46</div>
<div class="content">@ Lillian<br><br>The purpose of the past tense is to describe a static end state.  To describe the task as if it were already finished, so that you know what "finished" looks like.  If you know what "finished" looks like, then you can take whatever action you want given your current circumstance, to move yourself toward it.  <br><br>As an analogy, think of it as a horse race.  You can describe your task as the race itself (action verbs), or as the finish line (static, unchanging end point).  Describing the task in terms of the actions to take is like describing the race itself.  Picture the running stream of commentary, "Out of the gate it's Lucky-Large-Task in the lead followed closely by One-and-Done.  But wait, catching up on the inside track it's Little-and-Often as the pack barrels through the first turn..."  Writing your tasks as actions (with present tense action verbs in the form of a command) is like trying to keep a written record of this running commentary on the actioning of your overall task.  IMHO, this expands your list uncontrollably and forces you to pay undue attention to the upkeep of your list/system rather than the actual completion of your task.  Additionally, focusing on the actions can cause you to lose sight of the goal (in our race analogy, think of a race without the track or finish line - the horses would run everywhere and no one would know when they've finished the race).  <br><br>By using the GET "something done" construction you state something in the past tense, as though it were already finished.  This is a static description of a static event - that event being the finishing of your task.  It's like describing the finish line in the race.  If you describe that alone on your list, then you can keep the running commentary of actions as an entirely mental exercise - off the list.  The description of the finished task will trigger in your mind, the running commentary of actions - what you've already actioned, what you've left to action, what you can action next in your current context, within your current time constraints, and on and on, but all in your MIND rather than on your list.  This has the effect of keeping your list simple and succinct, and so allowing you to put less of your mental energy into maintaining your LIST, and more mental energy into WORKING YOUR TASK.  (specifically the mental running commentary of actions to take).  Additionally, by listing only the finish line, even without a track all the horses will know where to go and you'll know when the race is over.  <br><br>Again, people have become touchy on this subject because it appears that we suggest they care about the way they word their tasks, and so change the way they word their tasks.  Not so.  I’m simply stating that I care about the way that I word my tasks and this is why.  Take it or leave it, for what it’s worth to you.</div>

<div class="content">Follow up to my previous comment.<br><br>Using this methodology, your list changes from a list of "things to do" to a list of "things you want."  Your "to do list" it becomes your "goal list."  From "races to run" to "trophies you want."  The focus of your whole list changes from what you need to do, to what you want to achieve.  I've found it interesting that the FV question actually promts me to mentally convert each of my "goals" on my list into an action on the spot, in the context of the moment.  The question asks what I want to DO before x, ie: what action do I want to take before taking this action.  Thus, the question promts me to mentally check in on the state of each race as I read through the list of trophies I want to "get."  Thus the question serves two purposes for me - it serves its intended purpose in FV of buliding my task ladder, but it also helps me mentally keep tabs on the individual races at a glance, through every scan.</div>

<div class="content">Man.  I can't leave it alone can I?<br><br>My final comment.  I find that a list of "races to run" produces much more psychological resistence in me than a list of "trophies I want."  In fact, the latter tends to motivate me to action, while the former tends fill me with apprehension and overwhelm.  <br><br>I have used both methods, each for a period of years.  <br><br>Lists of races to run (and all the things to do in order to run them) result in my experience, in uncontrollably growing and directionless lists full of things I must bring myself to do.  <br><br>Lists of trophies I want (and no additional record of the things to do in order to win them) result in my experience, in succint and pointed lists full of things I can't wait to achieve.<br><br>Having used both, I have settled on the latter of the two, and that sums up why.</div>

However, its best to try to keep your points as short and sweet as possible, because i) most people may just not take the time to read it or ii) someone would get a general sense of what you're saying without fully reading the main points. I think that is what happened with my original post (it was too long) to the point that a very simple concept is causing confusion.

You said: 'automatically hear/read GET before each item'.  I dont think you are doing this. If this were done, you would not think you're doing something that's written in the past.

Just because I write '-everything done;  on my list, does not mean to do everything that's already done! (lol) Agreed, this makes 0%sense at all.

You will 100% of the time (too much confidence? lol) naturally and always, structure your tasks so that there is minimal confusion as to what to do.</div>

<div class="content">Miracle,<br><br>Brilliant explanation. Simply brilliant. Aligns perfectly with my experience, even though I have strayed from it. Now I see why I need to start incorporating past-tense outcomes again.<br><br>I would add that this is most critical and effective for me when I have one of those unclear and dreaded items. If I can just get myself to realize when I'm resisting a task for those reasons, and spend 30 seconds defining the goal/end state/finish line before I rewrite it, the angst goes away and the next action becomes clear. Instantly. <br><br>My favorite analogy is that of the guided missile. It's off-course most of its flight, course-correcting constantly, but the target never changes. If I have my target clearly defined, then the next steps are not only easier to determine, but also more flexible.

<div class="content">@ lillian<br><br>>> One question occurred to me as I read through this... it seems like tasks written this way are in the past tense in the task list -<br><br>Spare Battery ~found~<br>Shed ~built~<br>Aspirin ~taken~<br>Bathroom ~cleaned~ <<<br><br>All the verbs written between the tildas do not necessarily need to be there by default. It all depends on what your outcome is. You are assuming a verb must be there when in fact it doesn't per se.<br><br> In my shed examples (see post) I said "if I want to BUILD a shed" then -shed built suffices.<br><br>Understand that if I just wanted to get a shed (not necessarily build<br>one) then -shed suffices. <br><br> If I wanted to get aspirin , then -aspirin suffices. On the other hand, if I wanted to get aspirin taken (a bit silly to put on a task list, but fine..) then -aspirin taken suffices.<br><br>One more example, the bathroom cleaned does require the past tense action. Other wise it doesn't make sense This is just one of many possible cases. Think about it. Are you trying to (get) a bathroom?! Or (get) a bathroom cleaned? What's the outcome?<br><br> If you put '-bathroom' then that sounds like you're getting a bathroom in your house installed or something,  if you put -bathroom cleaned then it's clear the outcome is to get it cleaned.<br><br>Two very different things. Then again, common sense would probably kick in and you'd know what you meant. But for other examples it isn't clear cut like that.<br><br>As you can see, here's the general / hand wavy process: Something pops<br>in my head that I know must be done, I say 'get' in my head, then fill<br>in the remainder in list with (any) and enough words to make sense<br>....time passes and I stumble across this task. ....in doing mode, I<br>read task without ambiguity  because I simply say 'get', then read<br>task. The result is that it makes sense both ways.  This is the very<br>general sense of one of the benefits.  Mark's comparison in our lists<br>sums it up pretty accurately.</div>

<div class="content">Touching on some interesting analogies, the horse race, the thermostat/feedback loop, the guided missle. It shows that the little and often technique meshes really well with phrasing your tasks get____. Why?<br><br>By writing get______ where the blank is some outcome, its as if you have a goal/outcome/destination/result . The little and often approach encourages creatively thinking up ways to approach that outcome. The path is dynamic but the destination is static. What you don’t want is the destination to be dynamic (changing outcomes on your list). This is how you wont get things done. <br><br>The outcome is like a finish line or a flag that says “achieve me. You want this? come and get it!” and FV helps you do just that. Bare with me, but some flags just ‘call out’ louder than others.  (i.e. (get) tv watched shouts softer than (get) a meaningful workout). <br><br>Another analogy (jeez another one?...yes), Your GPS system. You input the destination (static) but there are multiple paths. If you lose focus and miss a turn it says “Recalibrating”. So the paths becomes dynamic but puts you back on track to get there. Think of the______ as your static destination you are trying to ‘get’ to and the little and often appraoach and FV as your  dynamic reclibrating tools to get there.  <br><br>Also, this path from ‘here to there’ can be broken down into necessary components (i.e 500 miles west, 200 miles north etc.) And with that said, you could input those as destinations and breakdown further and further but the end destination is the same.<br><br>Summary, don’t concern yourself too much with how to get there, most likely this will change frequently anyways or naturally present itself. Focus on where you want to get to first, let it motivate you and allow FV and little and often approach to assist to along the way.</div>

<div class="content">I think the Get ___ structure is useful in an even more general way than has been discussed so far.  There are many possible formulations that lead unambiguously to the desired outcome:<br><br>1. Get <noun>;  e.g., "a shed" <br>2. Get <noun> <adjective>; e.g., "bathroom clean"<br>3. Get <noun> <passive-verb>; e.g., "bathroom cleaned"<br>4. Get <adjective> <noun>; e.g., "stronger muscles"<br>etc.<br><br>The less words, the more open you are to various solutions when executing the task, which doesn't necessarily mean that there is ambiguity in what you want to Get. In the now-famous "shed" example, if listed simply as "[Get] a shed" the solutions include building, buying, contracting, moving, delegating, and probably other actions I haven't even considered (since I do not at present want to get a shed!).</div>

This has the effect of keeping your list simple and succinct, and so allowing you to put less of your mental energy into maintaining your LIST, and more mental energy into WORKING YOUR TASK. (specifically the mental running commentary of actions to take). <<<br><br>I get your point, but for me, keeping what you're calling the 'running commentary of actions' in my head will just make me anxious that something's getting missed or overlooked. Plus for me the mental energy of keeping track of it all is a lot higher than dumping it onto a list. <br><br>It depends on the scenario of course - if the task is '{get} bathroom cleaned' it's no overhead/energy to remember that I cleaned the mirror in an earlier chunk of work so I don't repeat that particular task and go right to mopping the floor.  <br><br>On the other hand, if the task is "{get} project X doc written" having the running commentary of "talk to Joe re item 1" and "check with Jane re status" and "find updated project .docx template" etc in my head will make me feel a lot less "mind like calm water" and more like "mind like level 5 white water rapids" especially if/when I have mutiple projects with similar steps going on. <br><br>I'd be more comfortable with a list like "talk to Joe re Project X, item 1" "check with Jane re Project X status" etc. My mental energy is concentrated on working on the tasks too, instead of mentally keeping track of tasks - and isn't that pretty much the point of the FV (or AF, SF, DWM....) list? :) :)</div>

I think those having difficulty with phrasing of tasks is because they have a hybrid of both lists. They have trophies and races jumbled together and get lost and call it resistance.

If I were to dump every possible action I think of then my list will grow extremely long and become difficult to manage/understand/scan.

<div class="content">Lillian, although you didn't address your question to all of us, here are my thoughts.<br><br>The basic task you have is "Get the room empty." This implies a series of binary decisions on everything that is currently occupying the room.  Mark has an excellent article about how to do this, somewhere on this site.  The basic idea is that it is easier to ask yourself one Yes-or-No question on each thing in the pile.  You can make decisions rapidly if you don't have multiple alternatives.  After each round, you should have much less to deal with, so splitting up the remaining stuff with a different Yes-or-No question will go even faster than the first round.<br><br>For your Empty Room example, you could start with "Discard <item>?" Yes or No. (Repeat question for everything in the room – end of first round.)  Then "Move <item> to use in another room?" Then "Donate <item>?" Then "Store/File <item> away?"  At some point, the pile that is left (from all the No answers) will be small and you'll know how to finish with it.  While doing all the sorting, discarding, donating, filing, and storing away, you can dream about what to use the soon-to-be-empty room for!<br><br>Hope this helps.</div>

"Easy" includes physical and psychological. I fill the box until it's no longer easy to put stuff in. Then I deal with the box (put in car for errands day, put on Daughter's bed to try on, throw away, file papers, etc.) I need to be careful that the box doesn't get too full, otherwise I'll stall in the middle of dealing with it. (It's been two years since I left a pile on top of the file cabinet!)<br><br>Then it's on to the next box, which will be of a different character.<br><br>I might have two or three boxes on the go, but rarely more.

<div class="content">Cricket,<br><br>I'll admit I haven't tried the iterative Yes/No method on anything as big as a room crammed with lots of stuff yet.  But I did use it quite successfully recently on a couple of desk drawers.  My goal was to make the two drawers I use all the time more functional.  They had gotten so crammed with stuff that I was hunting for the things I need.  I didn't even know which things I wanted to keep in which drawers.  So I pulled both drawers out of the desk, poured their contents out onto the floor in another room (with enough space to lay everything out), and then handled it all in about 90 minutes.  I used paper bags for the sorted piles.  First question was Garbage? – easy, one big bag into the trash.  Then was Not-in-these-drawers? – another big bag of stuff to be figured out later.  Then I had a lot less stuff to put back into the two drawers.  The last question was Drawer#1?  About half the stuff was piled ready for arranging in Drawer#1, the other half in a second pile for Drawer#2.  Had to vacuum & dust the drawers first, then it was quite joyous to arrange everything neatly and put the drawers back in the desk.  After a couple of days, I dispatched with the 'Not' bag of items similarly.<br><br>I highly recommend this technique, whenever you're faced with a pile of stuff that seems overwhelming.

<div class="content">The original post on this was about "How to clear a pile [of papers]?" and the technique I recommend is called Halving, and is reported to be from Mark's GED book (which I don't have a copy of).  For stuff that's not actually in a pile, you can certainly walk about with a box or bag (or tape & paper for labeling large items), and just gather or mark everything that meets the Yes answer. Then only the things that are still around and unlabeled need to be considered for the next question.  Even if you don't have a big enough box or the strength to move everything, I would think it's easy to identify everything in one go, rather than discarding/donating a box of stuff now, another box in a few days, etc.</div>

I just wrote whatever first came into my head that seemed good enough.<br><br>Actually, that last bit seems to be the common thread here.   Write it down in whatever way works for you, and don't worry about it too much.   If you like using a formula with seven required verbal keywords, use a formula with seven required verbal keywords.   If you like a particular semantic pattern, great.   If you get fully-formed objectives popping into your head in the "Get ________" structure, then use that.   If you feel lost without defining "next actions", then define "next actions".   If you don't follow any particular format or structure, that's fine too.   <br><br>FV can handle them all.   <br><br>If you feel you are struggling, then read threads like this to see what other people are doing, and maybe try something new or different.</div>

<div class="content">@ubi:  Halving is a fantastic technique, but only if you can motivate yourself to get started, and only if you can keep motivated long enough to get through the whole pile, and only if you can keep your attention long enough to remember what your halving criterion is.  :-)</div>

<div class="content">GBMW,<br><br>Thanks for sharing.<br>I am liking this Get___ business. It is a simple and brilliant idea. At least for us suffering from task phrasing problems. <br><br>I see that it benefits my decisions on the pre-selecting stage: It is faster now; it is easier to break down tasks into smaller ones *if* needed; and I'm not lost with my initially *brilliant* and *meaningful* key words. <br><br>On the other hand, no many more words are required: sometimes less.<br><br>I believe Mark's got interest on it as well. I'm waiting for his comments.</div>

<div class="content">@lillian<br>Although I answered your question about the 'converting a room but where you didn't know the actual room it would be converted to.', I didn't feel satisfied with my answer because I thought it wasn't sensitive enough to your situation. It was more of what I would do rather than what you should do. Then I remembered Mark's example of building a bridge. I think it would give you a better understanding of what and why I'm saying what I am saying.  It can be found here:<br><br><a href="../blog/Getting to Your Goals Step One.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2006/8/21/getting-to-your-goals-step-one.html</a><br><br>It is a better example than the essay one I gave and much clearer to understand.  </div>

<div class="content">GMBW,<br><br>This is awesome!  I've been trying this get structure for the past week now and I've been much faster when doing my tasks. I once used outcomes or something similar to it before discussed by Merlin Mann and then abandoned it because it was too much work. But This is very very simple. It took me a bit of creativity and warming up too at first but now I'm light years faster. I actually start my day doing a mind dump asking "What do I need to get", then get, and get... until I've fully cleared all my thoughts. Again, this is a huge gift to my task management arsenal. <br><br>I realized why I felt so much resistance with Superfocus. Many of my ill formed tasks just clogged my column 2 and required me to keep thinking. Big cognition drain! I noticed you said that important tasks pop out more than others.<br><br>The only thing is I'm not understanding. why do you keep saying to not also write the GET in the tasks?</div>
