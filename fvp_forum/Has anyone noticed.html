<div class="content">This announcement of Mark* is the perfect excuse to indulge in starting a fresh list by switching over to FVP. Which I did, yesterday.<br><br>I always have fresh nicey notebooks laying around, so this is also good to be able to pick one. Adios, computer, for now at least…<br><br>Somewhere I have a list of recommended pens I should get someday. Why not now? <br><br>Anyway.<br><br>Has anyone noticed that Mark called FVP thus the right way? The best system is also called the best system. The perfected version of the final version…<br><br>So far I had two good days with it. Let's see what everyone is comming up with…<br><br>Cheers!<br><br><br>____<br>* The last blog post of course…<br><a href="../blog/Which is the Best System.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2020/8/2/which-is-the-best-system.html</a></div>

<div class="content">I'm having a go at it again FVP, properly this time.<br>I've always had a problem trusting my intuition.<br>Which turned out to mean I second guess any list of work.<br>I had turned lately to scheduling my work, using an auto-scheduling app.<br>The idea is to let the algorithm decide how to spread out my work over a period of time.<br>This applies especially to tasks that have a long time to completion and need a great deal of attention over a period of time in order to produce a good final work product.<br>Scheduling is good, but the same problem presents itself. Namely that you make decisions to over-ride the auto-scheduled plan to cater for developments in your day or week. <br>This means that you are constantly changing the plan.<br>FVP deals with this better than anything I believe.<br>Started my FVP list on 5 August and just over 3 days I'm amazed at how well it dealt with all the things that cropped up.<br>The long term task is still there. But I'm looking at the list and trying to let the process guide me.<br>I found that it is important to read each task with attention on what is written, and let it sink in for a second when the situation demands it, and letting the process guide the urgency and importance of what I just read.<br>For other tasks, just reading it quickly is sufficient.<br>Anyway, I will give FVP a good go for 30 days on pen and paper and see how it goes.<br>Thank you Mark for that very timely blog post.</div>

Like everything else it improves with practice.<br><br><< I had turned lately to scheduling my work, using an auto-scheduling app. >><br><br>I've never been able to make one of those work. Life is just too unpredictable - and so are one's own moods!</div>

<div class="content">JD:<br><br>> This applies especially to tasks that have a long time to completion and need a great deal of attention over a period of time in order to produce a good final work product.<br><br>For these I have usually some sort of project planning document going. When I do work on such a task, I also update the plan. This feeds my intuition and makes me bette at FVPing, I think.</div>

<div class="content">Christopher,<br><br>Thanks for the tip. Yes, I am doing that now with OneNote. My FVP list has pointers to the relevant page. Sometimes, the big tasks getting naturally broken down in the list itself.<br><br>Some statistics about the system so far.<br>Been working with FVP for 10 days now.<br>I have 276 tasks recorded, 49 open tasks, 227 tasks done.<br>That's about 23 tasks per day done.<br>Those are impressive statistics to me. Credit goes to the system to be able to handle it all. Big tasks, small tasks, monitoring delegated tasks to my team, discussions with my bosses. I'm throwing everything at it and let it build up slowly over the 10 days.</div>
