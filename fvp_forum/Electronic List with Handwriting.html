<div class="content">After several years of railing against Apple's business model and the snobby attitude of some Apple fans. I have succumbed, almost a Damascene conversion.<br><br>Last month I bought my wife a new iPad to replace her ageing netbook.  When I go back from my Uganda assignment, I tried her new toy (she's fallen in love with it, common with the fairer sex ;-))))) ) and then ordered mine which arrived on Friday.<br><br>I have yet to download one game or leisure app because I want to integrate the iPad into my work as well as my non-work life.<br><br>Yesterday I downloaded three apps that facilitate handwriting: Paper and Penultimate (both free), and Notability (£0.69p).  I want to be able to replace my moleskine medium/A5 notebook (but not my pocket-size one) so that all my scribbled notes are available.  Of the three, I initially like Notability.<br><br>Early days (day?), however what may be of interest to others is that one can use FV in handwritten mode and make it easy to dot the chain selections, cross out etc.<br><br>That said, I am continuing to use Evernote as the tags make it so easy to have only the Chain tasks - a closed list - on view, easier to copy routine tasks etc.  I know Evernote can handle handwriting, but not been able to replicate that on the iPad (copy and send handwritten task to Evernote???).<br><br>Windows 8 devices may be even better with the handwriting, the XP and Windows 7 tablets do it already.</div>

<div class="content">Check out the Premium EverNote features and their Trunk. It claims to read PDFs and handwriting, at least well enough to index. It's not too hard to be careful with the few words needed to index a note.</div>

<div class="content">Hi there -another option is noteshelf - i think you can export pages to evernote as an image. <br><br>You have just inspired me to try this myself - I had migrated my 'computer' FV list to evernote but had stuck to pen and paper  for my 'home' list - I might try it on the iPad now that you have suggested this :)<br><br>i had looked at moving both my lists to evernote but find evernote for iPad just doesn't give the same flow...</div>

<div class="content">Paper is a fantastic app with oh so many potential uses. I'm interested to hear how that works for you.<br><br>Penultimate as well.<br><br>I've found handwriting on the iPad to be a bit clunky myself due to the obscenely large stylus tip that is necessary. I think the smallest you can get to actually work is 5 or 6mm.</div>
