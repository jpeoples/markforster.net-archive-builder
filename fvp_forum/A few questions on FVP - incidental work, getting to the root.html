<div class="content">Hi, I've been using FVP for a few weeks now and really admiring how much subtlety is built into the method. <br><br>Sometimes I will select my tasks and start out. Say I've selected the task "Take a walk." Since I'm regularly reviewing my list, I might, as I'm walking out the door, remember that I have "Take the deck furniture downstairs" on my list. So I'll grab a bit of furniture and take it with me, even though I didn't select the item. Taking down the deck furniture wasn't selected, but I did do some work on it. Do people typically go back and mark that item and rewrite at the bottom of the list because it was "worked on", even though it hadn't been selected?</div>

<div class="content">I do. I do not bother to go find that item on the list, but next time I come across, I acknolwedge the work done and move it down.<br><br>I like the feeling the of the list moving!</div>

<div class="content">I too would typically cross out and write at the bottom when I saw it the next time on the list if I didn't feel compelled to chase it down on the list immediately (which I sometimes am).</div>
