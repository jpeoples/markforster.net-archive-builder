<div class="content">No task is marked, since I just finished the first one. To proceed I mark the (new) first task. I don't want to do it now, so I scan the list. As it happens, no other task get's selected as I scan the whole list. <br><br>I return to the first task and still don't want to do it. (As in, I answer the first FFVP-question with a "no")<br><br>How do I proceed?<br><br>Scan the list again?</div>

<div class="content">I would just do it because no other task stood out. Keep in mind that you don't need to finish anything. You could just do something small to push this task forward and reenter it to the end.</div>

<div class="content">Christopher:<br><br>Have I got this right? You don't want to do the first task and there's no other task on the list which you want to do more than the first task. Therefore there is not a single task on your to-do list which you want to do. So in effect you are suffering from a general paralysis.<br><br>It happens sometimes.<br><br>Some possible remedies are:<br><br>- Think up some tasks which you do want to do, and add them to the list, AND/OR<br><br>- Work on the first task for five minutes and no more (use a timer). Do the same for the second task if you're still stuck - and so on, AND/OR<br><br>- Take a timed break of at least 30 minutes (an hour would be better) in which you can do anything you like as long as it isn't work, AND/OR<br><br>- If this is a frequent occurrence examine whether you are doing the right sort of work for you.</div>

<div class="content">Thank you both for your replies!<br><br>Mark's analysis was spot on. Given that he is a time-management coach for +18 years, not surprisingly but still mildly astounding.<br><br>What happened was that I had suppressed adding tasks of a specific area to the list, because I happened to be in a state of paralysis regarding that area. Subsequently the list as a whole was off balance.<br><br>Take away: Do not hesitate to add tasks to the list! Since we do HITM now, adding a task doesn't mean we have to complete it. Just add the thought, it will all sort itself out!<br><br>[Trust the Autofocus process™]</div>
