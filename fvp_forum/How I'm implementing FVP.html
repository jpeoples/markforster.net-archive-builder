<div class="content">By following the instructions as written :-)<br><br>(I thought Mark might want the encouragement.)<br><br>In more detail: I rewrote an existing list of 20 items in my favorite iPad app: Cloud Outliner.  It lets you move items up and down and check them. So I check the ones I select per the instructions and then work per instructions, then either delete done items or move them to the bottom. <br><br>I'm slightly worried about item 1 never getting attention, but only slightly as I don't really want to do it anyway. Eventually I'll be obligated to take it on.  At some point I'll feel ready. Until then, FVP is doing a good job of letting me ignore it :-)</div>

<div class="content">I'm using FVP in a lined Moleskine pocket softcover notebook in this way: <br><br>• The oldest active page is always marked with the notebook ribbon<br>• The newest active page is always marked with a removable clear tab<br>• The current task's page is always marked by tossing my pen into the notebook and closing the elastic around the notebook itself</div>
