<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">Okay, I'll play. FV-related post.<br><br>Many of us have used FV with success, then got bogged down.  Lists get long and stale.  Recently a new approach, which shall remain nameless, got first-class attention on this site. Several of us got excited and started using it.  Some of us fretted about what to do with our long old stale lists, and where to park new tasks.  So here are some thoughts about how to manage the FV list and feel the freedom of that other approach.<br><br>1. Want to weed.  Mark often weeded his FV list.  When you realize that the list is getting long or stale, add a 'weed list' task and choose it soon.  You've got to want it.  When weeding, be aggressive.  Are some of the tasks non-urgent and likely not to seem important in the next day or two?  If so, consider deleting it altogether, or parking a reminder somewhere to resurface a few days later.<br><br>2. Delete or defer root task in a responsible way. The root task is not optional in FV. But you can choose what action to perform, e.g. just open the file or think about what the next action is for only one minute.  This keeps FV moving but doesn't shorten the list, as the task must be re-entered, likely with little having been accomplished. If you realize that, while the task remains important, you probably aren't going to make significant progress soon, it's time to own up to the situation in an honest way. For example, you might need to admit your lack of enthusiasm to a boss, spouse, etc. By talking about it honestly, you can then just take it off the list. If it's really important to you, it will get there again.<br><br>3. Add only urgent tasks to the list. Instead of automatically adding anything that comes to mind to the list, pause and consider a few questions first. Am I likely not to *want* to do this today? Is it unimportant? Will I probably think of this again if I don't write it down? If I forget it, will nothing bad happen? If the answer is yes to any of these, you don't need it on your list. You might write it by itself on a piece of scratch paper or a post-it, to remind yourself of it later. But for today, you don't need to think about it and don't need it cluttering up your list.<br><br>4. Add one or two fresh tasks to each chain. Ideally, your chain will contain only three tasks: (1) the root, (2) something you freshly added that you want to do before tackling the root, and (3) something you freshly added that you want to do *right now*.<br><br>5. Consider not reentering. If you think you won't want to continue a task today or very soon, decide whether you need a reminder at all. If so, put it somewhere, but not right back on the list.<br><br>Comments?</div>

<div class="content">I've systematically been using FV (at work only) for almost one year now. I simply worked the system following the rules, and I've never felt that the list got out of hand. Note that point 2 mentioned in the initial post is simply part of the rules!<br><br>What I noticed it that the number of open entries tends to hover around an average value, that slowly changes over time. For a long time, it has consistently been 70 - 80 open entries; then it went up to 90 - 100, whereas now I'm down to around 50. So actually some weeding happened of its own accord...<br><br>As I am fond statistics (KPI, anyone?), here some numbers purely as illustration.<br>*I added 2440 entries since I started using FV.<br>*In average I'm adding and closing 15 à 16 entries per day, so the inflow is (almost) compensated by the closing of items.<br>*In recent weeks, the oldest open items are about 9-12 working days old. This used to be 20 or more in the past. This means that currently, things get actioned faster.</div>

<div class="content">I'm going to make the effort here to succeed fully with FV.  I haven't encountered any problems with it yet except my own inconstancy.  I think if you have a will to make it happen, you can of yourself come up with solutions, such as those ubi mentions, to perceived problems.</div>

<div class="content">I, too, have had really good success with FV, and see patterns similar to Marc's (though I recently stopped keeping close track of such things) - the list is relatively stable, with occasional up- or down-ticks in times of high or low demand. My root task is pretty consistently between 3 weeks and 1 month old. (Currently my list is at 137 and my oldest task was entered on 7 February.)<br><br>The biggest thing I have to guard against is going on autopilot while choosing the chain and not adhering strictly to the question. I don't remember where it was, but relatively recently (certainly this calendar year), Mark clarified (and I'm paraphrasing here) that putting something in the chain is effectively saying "I'm going to do this now" and the only things that get added are things that need to be done before the previous "now" commitment.<br><br>I also delete a reasonable number of tasks - whether they're the root task or just fleeting thoughts that, once I look at them again, aren't worth my time/effort.<br><br>I've used analog and two different digital implementations of FV. Currently I'm using Evernote and it has simplified things for me quite a bit simply because it truly can be a universal capture site moreso than any other software system I've used. <br><br>If there's interest, I can elaborate on my Evernote FV workflow, but I don't think it's all that revolutionary/interesting/something that all of you couldn't think of yourselves.</div>

<div class="content">After about a year of trying I've finally made FV work for me. The discussions and my experiments with Mark's most recent system gave me the idea to try FV again but with the chains fixed at 3 tasks only. I also started my list from scratch, viewing my old list as a backlog  to be whittled down.<br><br>I've been doing this for three days now & I'm quite surprised just how productive and motivated I've been. FV was,to me, the most logical way to work a list. But I tended to make chains too long and rather soul destroying.<br><br>But there does seem to be something in having 3 things on your list at once. Perhaps it's the boost you get when you finish a short chain. Or the short time span between selection and action.<br><br>This method certainly gets me in a "flow" phase and is a bit addictive. I'll see how it goes for the coming week and post again.</div>

<div class="content">I've been using FV since its inception and continue. I do FV off of a DWM list, which means that the order of tasks change (started tasks get higher on the list, second only to tasks greater than 23 days old). I also agree you need to limit the chains (more so with a DWM list because of the order of tasks) I do this by time boxing and ensuring I only select tasks for 1-2 hours at a stretch (shorter if I have meetings which is often).<br><br>This works well> I am sure no matter what TM system I use in the future, it will have expiration dates a la DWM and I will use FV on it.</div>

<div class="content">Calibre,<br>I'm curious to hear how the three-item chain works out for you. I had been toying with the idea as well.</div>

<div class="content">Sarah<br><br>As the list got longer my 3 task chain approach became less effective and was abandoned.<br><br>I am currently using FV in conjunction with SMEMA.<br><br>I've used SMEMA on and off since Mark first suggested it (with great results) but I've been unwilling to let go of my task list.<br><br>So...I  preselect a list of tasks or projects as per the FV instructions. Then I work it, using SMEMA, on a separate sheet of paper. This gives me a framework in which to break down a task or project into smaller steps. I quickly gain momentum on intimidating or unpalatable tasks. I also stay with things rather than being distracted by time wasters. <br><br>Some might think this is adding overhead to FV but I feel i'm getting a method of capturing all my todo's in one place, a method of deciding what want's doing now and a method that enables me to chew tasks up into small enough pieces that I actually do them.</div>

<div class="content">Caibre65 and Sarah,<br><br>As I mentioned in my last post, I've been AWOL from FV and its precedents for many months.  So I've had to find out what SMEMA means and how it works.<br><br>I've also been 'encouraged' to find so many of us suffer like me from a wandering attention mode which gets in the what HAS to be done , and we KNOW it has to be done.  Talk about avoidance!<br><br>I like the Inbox that Sarah advocates, I call it 'Capture', so that I do capture it before the next passing thought gets in the way.<br><br>Sarah replied in another thread/post that she applies FV to that list.  I have been trying to restrict the chain to no more than five.<br><br>However, this SMEMA seems a worthwhile tweak or add-on, I'll try it out over the next few days.  It seems when one gets 'into the groove (I often use the Salami method to get momentum, start with 10 minutes, keep adding five minutes to each 'slice' ie six rounds brings 10 + 15 + 20 + 25 + 30 + 35 = 135 minutes ie over two hours without a break) , then short SMEMA chains can result in progress in those things that matter.<br><br>A luta continua.<br><br>NTW: learning as I go - great to see you posting again, you are a true inspiration to the rest of us.<br><br>Roger J</div>
