<div class="content">Are you working on your most important things?  I propose an untested exercise to evaluate yourself:<br><br>Follow the FV selection method, but instead ask "What's More Important?", and instead of a dot, mark with a plus (+).  But don't do those items.<br>Now go back and run FV following the normal "want to do before" question.<br>Rerun the importance selection method and add +'s.  Normally the importance of things shouldn't change so the previously +'d items are still correct in their order.  But because you did some, others may show up in between or at the end.<br>Continue doing FV.<br><br>After a while, review the +'s and see if you are doing enough of them, or too many not-important items.  <br><br>Reaction step: When you see you aren't doing enough important stuff, consider why.  Consider which less important stuff you can remove from the list to make room for the important.</div>

<div class="content">Interesting. What you tagged as "+" for "what's more important" seems quite similar to what I tagged as "!" for "what I want to do today or tomorrow". <br><br>My full FV list generally contain what I want to do within this month. When preselecting over my full FV, those items with "!" tagged items may jump out to me. Other times I filter my list to show only "!" tagged items, and preselect only over that short list (as I mentioned just now in another post).</div>

<div class="content">I don't see that my "more important" items necessarily get done today or tomorrow or even next week.</div>
