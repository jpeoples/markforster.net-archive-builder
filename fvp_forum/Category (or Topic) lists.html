<div class="content">Is it within the rules to occasionally pull out all tasks that can be done together, ignoring the question "What do I want to do before I do x?"<br><br>For example, spread throughout my list are a bunch of admin tasks. It would be easiest to extract them all into a seperate list (or dot them all) and deal with them as one task. Another example might be extracting things to buy onto a shopping list, or extracting a list of phone calls to make.<br><br>I don't want to break the rules, but this seems like a useful thing to be able to do.</div>

<div class="content">Add a new task at the end of your list:  "Extract all administrative tasks".   Put a dot next to it.</div>

<div class="content">I do this sort of thing all the time. if I'm going shopping, I'll check the list for things I want to buy. If I'm going to have a phone session, I'll extract calls in the same way.<br><br>Having said that, I often find that administrative tasks, particularly recurring ones, naturally group themselves on the list so that they get done together.</div>
