<div class="content">ok, so I've only been using FV two days at work, which isn't a lot of real-world experience, but why should I let that stop me? :)<br><br>I noticed 2 things using FV. One is that when I finish a chain, and get ready to start a new one, I sometimes use AF1 rules and pick whatever 'stands out' instead of creating a FV chain. Next time I'm at the list, I might do a FV chain. Not sure why I'm switching between the 2, or it matters, but there it is. <br><br>Today got a bit busy, so I was adding things to the bottom of the list. I looked at the list afterwards to see what the next dotted item was...and realized I'd dotted ALL the new items. I don't remember doing it, it 'just happened' when I wrote the task on the list. I ended up un-dotting everything (white-out tape is a wonderful thing) and started over creating a new chain. It was easier than trying to keep track of which were "part of the chain" dots and which were "not chain" dots.' Obviously, I need a new rule to not dot new things, just because they're new things!</div>

<div class="content">UnaV,<br><br>I think you can address this without an extra rule. Remember that each time you move to the next task on your selection, you go to the bottom dotted task. I found to start with that I was tempted to go to the next task above the one I'd just finished. I think this is the only way to get the symptoms you describe.</div>

<div class="content">Will - that makes sense if I was dotting the new items because they needed to be done before everything else. But I was dotting them just because I wrote them down.</div>

<div class="content">It makes sense to me. At the moment you wrote them down, you were thinking about them. In GTD's words, they were "latest and loudest". Naturally, at that moment you put a dot on them. Then, after they'd aged a bit, they weren't so loud. Is it better to err on the side of dotting (and erasing) or not dotting (and ignoring them until you make the next chain)?</div>
