<div class="content">FV relies on structured procrastination, a ranking of tasks by avoidance. An antidote to avoidance is to take 2 micro-steps towards starting the task and then deciding not to proceed. <br><br>I've found this brings clarity and illuminates what exactly it is I'm avoiding, which is not usually the task but an emotion or unhelpful thought that I've connected to the task. I'm usually then choosing less from emotion and more willing to accept the uncomfortable feeling.</div>

<div class="content">Michael, this is a very interesting post – thanks.<br><br>Could you give an example of your "2 micro-steps towards starting the task"?</div>

<div class="content">An example: avoiding the washing up - go stand at the sink, put on the rubber gloves, fill the sink. STOP. Walk away. Notice your reactions.</div>

<div class="content">If you have done the first three steps, then they were a complete waste of time if you don't go through with the subsequent steps.<br><br>Starting is usually the biggest step, then the next one.<br><br>At least in my book.</div>

<div class="content">So... the idea is that once you understand the emotion that you've been avoiding you can then more easily move past it?</div>

<div class="content">Marco: kind of. Except the aim is expanded awareness, bringing a new perspective, and a feeling of relief that the next action is decided by values rather than thoughts or emotions about the avoidance, rather than a merely intellectual understanding.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike<br>Values are comprised of both thoughts and emotions.  That's what they are. <br><br>Read the other post you started.  The only values without thoughts and emotions are values that you're apathetic to or ignorant of. <br><br> When we avoid something we want to get done, we're up against conflicting values: conflicting thoughts and emotions packages.  These work arounds serve to lessen the thoughts and emotions that are creating the desire to avoid it.  It helps to break the conflict by reducing the perceived negative thoughts that create negative emotions.  <br><br>I won't keep chattering about it but you're leading yourself astray if you're attempting to cut off your emotions to get things done.  If your only emotions created avoidance, you wouldn't care.  The conflict comes from want the thing done for some reason even if it's only to avoid a hassle if you don't do it!  LOL!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Roger J<br>Are you the same guy who travels all around the world including potentially "dangerous" 3rd world countries?  If so, I'm so glad to see you back for a visit!  I hope things are going well for you and yours.<br><br>re: this post.  I'm in your camp.  In the example about the dishes, I'd have to hammer myself with a **itload of resolve to take that first step.  Like you, the second one can be just as tough.  For me it might take many small steps before I'm willing to shoulder into it to get it done.  *blush*  I do have the advantage that I KNOW what's creating my resistance most of the time.  It's usually working through physical pain or blasting through a task I know I'm going to hate because I know it's boring!  Boredom is my nemesis!  After 60 years I've gotten better at approaching the work, yet it's never gotten easier!  I truly believe that my exaggerated aversion to boredom is genetic predisposition.  I do finish the mundane stuff but each and every time it's a battle requiring courage and honor!  LOL!</div>
