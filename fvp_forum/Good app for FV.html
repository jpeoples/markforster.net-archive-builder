<div class="content">If you are looking for a very nice app for FV I can recommend you an app called Wunderlist. It is available almost in all platforms (Linux, Mac, Win, iPhones, Adnroid) and even in the web. Doting a task can by done via starring it. And all the rest is done via the FV algorithm :)<br><br>Does anyone has any other recommendations for apps? Or maybe the old pencil and notebook are the best solution?<br><br>I am still in testing phase: I used to work with the notebook, but now I switch to Wunderlist. I wonder if I will stick with it...</div>

<div class="content">Have a read of the Electronic Version thread which covers this and loads of other options.  Have to say I am a big fan of Wunderlist myself.</div>

<div class="content">So far I've found focus pad originally designed for autofocus on the iPhone works really well with FV<br><br>One touch entry from any position adds a new item to the end of the list. Two touches highlights as an equivalent to dotting. <br><br>Items can be marked as done, dismised, or done and automatically re-entered at the end of the list.- together with notes. <br><br>It supports multiple lists and items can be moved between lists or set to move between lists on a future date - perfect for "someday maybe" items. Also can be set to highlight (dotted) on a set date in the future. <br><br>Completed pages can be deleted or archived and on one touch can toggle between all pages, live pages, and archived pages. <br><br>The app works very naturally with FV and syncs to focuspad.ws where you can also work online.  <br><br>There are no contexts or tags though you can search in the online version.  <br><br>Any one else tried this?</div>

<div class="content">Alison,<br><br>I believe you asked somewhere in the long "Electronic Version" thread if people were using multiple lists in Wunderlist. I've been using Wunderlist as well, and I use multiple lists. Here's how.<br><br>I currently have these Lists:<br>FV @ Office<br>FV @ Home<br>Waiting For<br>Someday/Maybe<br>and then a couple more for some special or bigger projects.<br><br>I add tasks to whichever List they seem to belong. I don't stress about it too much. <br><br>Then I either go through each list or click the View All button, and star (dot) my chain of 3-5 items. I really try to limit the length. It seems to keep the motivation high, and the trust as well. I know chains will be completed fast, and new items will get reviewed quickly as well. <br><br>The neat thing is that by sorting things in different Lists, when I am building a chain I can choose to see all, or just the Lists that seem relevant at the moment (like not looking at the work list when I'm home).<br><br>Then I view by Starred, and work the chain. Easy, easy. No hacking, and it works on all platforms right out of the box. <br><br><br><br>P.S.  I've also been using BlancList exclusively at work. It's been keeping me focused on doing, not tweaking my lists. That is a bad pattern of mine, and BlancList seems to be so simple and fast and tweak-less, that I just do my work. But no sync, so it's just useful for my desktop computer at work.</div>
