<div class="content">Hi, I am also a user of OmniFocus and am interested in how you implemented.<br><br>The issue is I find that when I complete a flagged repeating task the new task becomes flagged as well.<br><br>Is this the desired behavior ?</div>

<div class="content">Hey Steven,<br><br>for not answering earlier. I so wish that OF would have a setting that new instances don't inherit the flagged state. But what I actually do is unflag the task before completing it.</div>
