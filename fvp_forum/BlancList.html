<div class="content">Hi all,<br><br>I'm trying BlancList again (<a href="http://blanclist.com)" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://blanclist.com)</a> - they've made some great improvements and I'm really excited about it. Just pointing it out for any new Final Version users here who might be looking for an electronic solution.</div>

<div class="content">In this forum you need to leave a space after the url <a href="http://www.blanclist.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.blanclist.com</a> .<br><br>Just tried BlancList again on my Chrome desktop and Android SGS2 browser. With a long list, scrolling on SGS2 does show some display glitch but okay I think. I'm still holding out for "long notes" and "import/export" features before I give it a more extensive tryout.<br><br>As is, I agree with what Stephen Hawkes said of his app ...<br><br><< We're working hard to make this the best implementation of Mark Forster's Final Version there is. We've just released a couple of new features. Tasks can be edited just by clicking the text now, or you can click the icon on the right of each task to mark it as done. We've also added a filter to allow you to review your done items.<br>More on the way next time, but we think we've now got everything that covers the base method. >></div>
