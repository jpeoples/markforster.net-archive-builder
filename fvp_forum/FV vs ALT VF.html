<div class="content">Do you alternate between the two versions of FV or use only one. (Which one?)<br><br>I find that I start the day with normal FV to get into the day and then switch to ALT FV after my first chain.<br><br>The ALT FV can sometimes take me more than a day to complete as these are difficult tasks.</div>

<div class="content">I've been using alt FV only (since it was issued). Why? It seems to flow better for me than the original version. Resistance is a feeling I can clearly identify so it's a good indicator for task selection. Also, I like to keep things as simple as possible thus I don't want to think about changing my question.</div>

<div class="content">I've only used the original FV question so far, although when I read through the entire list at  work (before making the first chain of the day) if something jumps out AF-style, I'll do that item before setting up a FV chain.</div>

<div class="content">Another possibility is to use Prioritized FV instead of FV-AV, but only marking priorities based on resistance?</div>

<div class="content">I generally use the canonical question ("What to do before X?")<br><br>Sometimes I find myself going numb to that.    It becomes meaningless, and instead I find myself asking "What else do I want to do on this chain?"<br><br>So I've started to switch it up a bit when I find myself going numb like that.<br><br>I try wording the canonical question differently, while retaining the same basic meaning (following Mark's advice, picked up from various forum threads):<br>- What is a higher priority than X?<br>- What is more urgent than X?<br>- What must I do before X?<br>- What else to do before X?<br>- What do I think should be done before x?<br>- What needs to be done first?<br>- What needs to be done more than this, in the near future?<br><br>Sometimes if I feel tired or burdened or the list is just bothering me, I might try an Alt-FV approach, by asking a different question altogether.  Basically, this means thinking about other psychological indicators that might give me a clue about what really needs to be done "before X", and why I am not able to see it clearly:<br>- What am I resisting even more?  (essentially the same as Mark's Alt-FV)<br>- What would I love to do first?<br>- What would I hate to do first?<br>- What would Spouse want me to do first?<br>- What would Boss want me to do first?<br>- What would Mom want me to do first?<br><br>I find I must retain the same question for the whole chain, otherwise it just gets too confusing and generates brain fog.   So I don't recommend jumping between questions.  If you need a new question, just grab the first one that appeals to you or makes sense, and stick with it for at least the duration of one chain, and switch back to the canonical form before trying anything else.<br><br>This usually helps bring the list back to life.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim, that's refreshing! Thank you. I will try some of your questions. Also, as I am experimenting with Dreams, I will try "what does my Future Self want me to do before..."</div>

<div class="content">Just to elaborate on the future self thing: try feeling the difference in energy between current-you and future-you, and then bring the future-you energy into the present. One way to do that is to mark out 2 areas or spaces on the floor and get a strong felt and imagined sense of future you energy inhabiting that space and then physically stepping into it and back to current-you.</div>

<div class="content">Watch out, Michael, if you do that too often, you and Future You can switch places and you'll be stuck in an infinite time loop.   It happened to somebody I know at work, and he just hasn't been the same since.</div>

<div class="content">Using and alternate question seems a lot like finding a different focus for each chain as was mentioned in an earlier thread.  Sometimes its driven by time of day or upcoming scheduled events.  Other times I find it's driven by wanting to do things that specifically lead up to the root task.  Most of it isn't well defined, but there often seems to be a theme to a chain.</div>

<div class="content">The Ron Paul post was tongue-in-cheek but for me it really does lead to a useful approach.   Think about ANY mentor, your Round Table of personal heroes.  What kind of advice would they give you?   What would these mentors advise you to do "before X"?<br><br>I wouldn't take these kinds of exercises too far, but they can be useful to get a list unstuck.</div>

<div class="content">My chief mentor advises me to be in the right state of mind before deciding anything. He says if I take a moment to move to a peaceful state I'll make better decisions because then I have access to more wisdom.</div>

<div class="content">I like the multiple-question method. (Just suggested it in a different thread. Great minds think alike?) Some questions should be used more often (eg urgency).</div>

<div class="content">Quick question on this:<br><br>FV is supposed to major on psychological readiness through the use of the question - 'What do I want to do before X?' So, does asking any of the other questions, or changing the question in the middle of the day compromise psychological readiness in any of your experiences?<br><br>{disclaimer - I'm starting FV next week as I've got too much to get through by the weekend to set it up properly now, but want to do so when I am able to...}</div>

<div class="content">Don't make it complicated.  It really is as simple as following the rules as Mark laid them out.  No setting up needed.  Just write down tasks.  You actually can start with just 2.  You probably wouldn't be reading this if you only had two, but in theory you could.<br><br>Make a list of your too many things.  Even better if you already have a list.  Then just mark and do per the rules.  Ignore the rest of what you read here unless you've actually followed the rules for a week or so.  If you have problems, aren't happy with your progress, or have questions, then come back to the forum and look for more info or insight.  Otherwise, just keep doing stuff.<br><br>Ask the right question and don't think too hard when doing it.</div>

<div class="content">dmic - I try to keep it simple and stick with the original question.  If I find myself going "numb" to that question -- I can't answer it -- I can't decide if anything needs to be done before X -- I don't have a good feel for it -- it isn't working -- I feel unfocused and can't break out of it -- then I change the question.   The ones I find most effective personally, are "What would my boss want me to do before X?" (when I am at work)  and  "What would my wife want me to do before X?" (when I am at home).    <br><br>Those questions really bring things into focus and help me prioritize and get moving again:  in other words, they increase my "psychological readiness" and focus it and sharpen it.   <br><br>Once I am moving again, I switch back to the canonical question.   That helps prevent this tweak from becoming complicated, or from becoming a neverending search for the perfect question.</div>
