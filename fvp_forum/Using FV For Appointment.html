<div class="content">One technique for making decisions with Mark's previous decisions was to write down all the alternatives and let "standing out" determine which action to take (deleting the other alternatives one the one was found).<br><br>Has anyone tried this with FV yet? I feel that it would work in a similar fashion, even though the selection algorithm has been changed since the older systems.<br><br>I don't have any big decisions coming up that I know of, but I'll try this next time it comes up :)</div>

<div class="content">Bernie briefly touched that topic in here:<br><a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/fv-forum/post/1760497#post1761490" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/fv-forum/post/1760497#post1761490</a><br><br>> (…) tonight I used the technique inadvertently when I wrote the next step for a project and <br>> then changed my mind, and then changed it again. There were three options written down, <br>> and I'm still not sure which way I want to go, so I'll wait until one of them answers "what do <br>> I want to do before x?"</div>
