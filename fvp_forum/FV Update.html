<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2012-10-18 20:22</div>
<div class="content">Here's an n=1 anecdote.<br><br>I had been doing FV for months and found that, occasionally, my backlog would grow. So, I decided to "want" to do all items in my list that were older than a week. <br><br>(That was not an original idea of mine. It was from Mark Forster's DWM system.)<br><br>That worked really well. But I realized that I always had a one-week backlog. It dawned on me that if I wanted to have a six-day backlog, I could have it.<br><br>So, I committed to a six-day backlog. And it worked.<br><br>I was really humming along with this short backlog, when I decided to challenge myself some more.<br><br>Before I explain what I did next, I want to emphasize that the particulars of my experience are not especially important (IMHO). That is, the fact that I committed to increasingly smaller backlogs is probably not that relevant to many readers.<br><br>What I think is important is that my consistent use of FV made me develop better habits, become better at managing time, and have more self-control and discipline.<br><br>Once those improvements kicked in, it was only natural that the way that I use FV would evolve.<br><br>I read Mark's blog post about a must-do list and some of Cricket's references to Agile Results. I had always had a kind of "today list" (I believe that is Daneb's term) which I kept in tasksmash.com (but could be done in beeminder or any other place). I also always had a "this week list."<br><br>I never consistently did the things on my weekly list. I almost always did the things on my today list, but that was because my today list was structured like FV, if I do anything on the today list, I count it as a win.<br><br>With my new-found grit, I decided that I would start putting things on my today and week list that can only count as wins if real results are achieved. So, it is no longer possible to merely take out the file folder and feel great. I still use that as the win criterion for my FV list, but not for my today and week list.<br><br>I am sure there are some people reading this who will smirk. Having a certain result completed at a certain time is not exactly revolutionary. But those kinds of deadline-driven systems have never worked for me before. I always resisted them and failed at them.<br><br>I am still only in the early stages of this. It is too soon for me to declare it a success. But the fact that I felt sufficiently competent to attempt this is a success of sorts, in my estimation.<br><br>Again, the point I am trying to make is not that I have found a tweak that improves FV. I have not. The point is that by using FV consistently I have become more disciplined and more able to take on greater challenges. The use of FV has changed me, and as I change, the way that I use FV changes.<br><br>(By the way, now that I am committing to getting results before the deadline, my FV backlog has increased by a day or two. I am more than happy to let this happen because it is quite clear that I am getting much more of the important stuff done.)</div>

<div class="content">Moises - Yay!<br><br>Your story reminds me of the time a cleaned my boss's desk. He was looking for ways to keep me busy. His desk had 6 inches of paper. It took me a week. I even showed him the super simple filing method: Year, then one of 5 topics. Easy, right? It took him 2 weeks to reach 6 inches again. Hence the Theory of Desk Level Consistency.<br><br>Which sounds a lot like your consistent 7-day backlog.<br><br>Very glad your system is working. Looking forward to hearing the next evolutionary step!</div>

<div class="content">Cricket,<br><br>Another thing I learned to implement from you was milestones, that is, intermediate deadlines.<br><br>I would love to love everything and everyone. But I don't. And I don't think that I ever will. One important way that I get things done is by creating urgency. Having deadlines creates urgency. Making it a rule that my backlog cannot exceed x days creates urgency.<br><br>Otherwise, I tend to go into "out of sight, out of mind" mode. With GTD I would look at my list once a week. And then I would do nothing until next week when I would look at my list again. <br><br>My GTD list did not have the DWM urgency, whereby an item gets deleted if not actioned within a week. My GTD list had no deadlines. So there was always something that seemed more important or urgent than the stuff on my GTD list.</div>

<div class="content">I wonder if, as your normal backlog shrinks, you'll set milestones differently. Take a project you expect to take 10 weeks. It's now week 0, due week 20. Given your other commitments, it makes sense to finish first milestone the end of week 11. If you know you're often a week late, you'll set the first milestone at the end of week 10. If you absolutely know you'll meet it, you'll set it at the end of week 11. Or maybe you'll keep them a week early and finish a week early.<br><br>I need to work on my backlog. It varies with project. Personal projects slip more than those for others. Early milestones rarely slip. Middle ones slip lots, and end ones don't.</div>
