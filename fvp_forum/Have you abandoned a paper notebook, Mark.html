<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>It sounds like you are really enjoying adapting and using Evernote for your FV list.  Have you completely given up on using a paper notebook?  I must say, I never thought I would have seen the day.  :))</div>

<div class="content">Yes, I have because I've found that Evernote is much faster than paper and pen, which was not the case with any other electronic implementation I've tried using, which have all seemed very "clunky" to me. And because the set-up is completely under my control I can use it exactly how I want.</div>

<div class="content">Mark, <br><br>Going through your posts in <a href="../fvp_forum/NEW! Screencast Evernote & FV (better quality, better workflow (courtesy of Mr. Forster).html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/fv-forum/post/1765213</a> I noted you ...<br>(1) use only EN Windows (no mobile versions)<br>(2) use "DO" tag (not "FV Chain")<br>(3) like being able to focus on on the "DO" preselect list tasks<br>(4) sort by "Updated", so recurrent tasks when updated goes to top/end of list<br>(5) change "Updated" date manually to put a tickler future date<br>(6) consider adding notes to task as working on it, that automatically change "Updated" date, and move to top/end of list<br>(7) use "DO" saved search for {notebook:"FV List" tag:"DO"} <br>(8) do not have "FV List" as default notebook, so item #7 ensure focus remains on "FV List" notebook when looking at "DO", and new urgent tasks gets created in "FV list"<br>(9) have "In-Box" as default notebook for anything else notes/documents <br>(10) drag "the circle" at the right of notes title, to hyperlink notes to other notes/apps<br>(11) view tasks in List format (not Snippet or Thumbnail) <br>(12) doing 50+ tasks, and 2 or 3 chains per day<br><br>Any other EN Windows tweaks for FV you are using, Mark?</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>I'm very happy with my (Outlook tasks) electronic setup when I'm at my laptop, but find I need a separate paper list for when I'm not. I am encouraged that you find a PC based electronic solution adequate: what's your approach when you're out and about?<br><br>- Separate list on paper?<br>- Use your head?<br>- Carry your Laptop wherever you go?<br>- ...?</div>

<div class="content">sabre:<br><br>I'm not sure whether (5) works - I haven't actually tried it. It was suggested by someone else. I've changed (9) so that new notes go into "General" unless otherwise routed. (10) is a general remark about EverNote rather than about the FV implementation. I don't think I've used it for FV.<br><br>The only thing I'd want to add is that the easiest way to tag highlighted notes as DO (or whatever you want to call it) is to right click on one of the notes and use Tag Note. It's quicker than dragging the notes into the margin.<br><br>My only other deviations from Avrum's video are that I don't bother to keep the question as a Tag and I just delete tasks I've finished with. I don't transfer them into a Completed notebook.</div>

<div class="content">Further to Will's question, have you returned home yet?  It's easy to stay digital when all your work is computer-based.  I find at home it's just more painful to keep attached to a computer as I'm going around doing household stuff.  Now if you're at home mostly doing writing and planning and webbing with the occasional other chore then of course that would work fine.</div>

<div class="content">I had written a paragraph, but the website apparently (3rd time this week) threw it out with this:<br><br>  The connection was reset        <br>          The connection to the server was reset while the page was loading.<br><br>It was something about using software is easy only if you are usually attached to a computer.  Mark: Have you returned home yet?  Are you usually attached to a computer?<br><br>[Edit: Now, after several I wrote a whole new paragraph, and more errors, it decides to show up.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Mark.<br><br>I remember your epic "day in the life of AF 4" demo, you had a number of distinctly non work tasks on your list. I'm trying to imagine my Beloved's reaction if I kept popping into the study between jobs. (She has a healthy distrust of my relationship with the Internet.)<br><br>No, it's too painful...</div>

<div class="content">Yeah, well I'm still a big fan of the PTP implementation.  That's "Pressed Tree Pulp."  Or as you OneNote and EverNote users might call it, "PaperNote."<br><br>I won't evangelize, I'll just say I like it simple.  <br><br>*shrugs* to each their own right?</div>

<div class="content">Notepad and mechanical pencil work eminently fine for me, so I see no need to complicate by digitising. But that's just personal preference - horses for courses, I say!</div>

<div class="content">Miracle- I like PTP much better than DT (Dead Tree) as a paper acronym.</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br>I noticed in the 1-month poll thread that you've switched back to paper for FV, after using Evernote for a while for that purpose. Would you care to comment on why you made the switch?</div>

<div class="meta">2012-04-19 8:36</div>
<div class="content">I wondered the same thing. Did you just really miss the feel and flexibility of pen on paper, Mark? Or you needed to use Evernote other than on your laptop, and you're not comfortable with Evernote Android?</div>

<div class="content">I am also curious about the return to paper. Did Evernote encourage tinkering? Other reasons?</div>

<div class="content">At home I use an A4 folder with looseleaf lined refill sheets. I like the size and the fact that one only needs to have current pages in the folder. It was however too big to take with me. I started my travels with a smaller notebook, but found it was too small for easy use. I then couldn't find an Australian notebook that I liked. I was also keen to try out the Evernote method in any case so it just seemed a natural progression to start using it. I really appreciated its synch abilities too because I had to use several different computers at various stages.<br><br>Once I got home and was static again I used Evernote for a few days, but found myself hankering for my big folder.</div>
