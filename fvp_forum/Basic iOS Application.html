<div class="content">I'm currently taking a coding class and it inspired me to make a very simple final version application for iOS that would work well with Mark Forster's systems. I'm happy to share it with others, but don't have the money for a developer account. Does anyone know another good way to share an application? I'd also love to see comments about features people would like to see in an app like this.</div>
