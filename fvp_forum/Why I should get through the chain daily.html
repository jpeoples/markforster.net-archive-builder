<div class="content">My current FVP practice has me cranking through the list in two basic modes.<br><br>The day starts with "heads down" so to speak, trying to complete the chain and reaching the root task as fast and mightily as possible. Once that happened at least once, I tend to relax and work on the more elaborate dealings or find a more exotic setting eg. do all those tasks in the garden, write a bunch of larger email replies, etc pp<br><br>Sometimes I need longer to even get through the chain for the first time. <br><br>This can also be very productive, because in FVP the chain gets prolonged several times while working on it.<br><br>But every day I should move forward at least one root task.<br><br>I feel that is the proper function of the system. Why?<br><br>Let's look at it this way: all tasks on your long list could be sorted into a few groupings, much lie contexts in GTD.<br><br>By this I don't mean you go out of your way and sort your long list, just that you could see the different types of work that are inherent to your list of tasks.<br><br>Now, during your typical work day you should "travel" through every type of time. You know, the morning when you are fresh and strong. The minutes after lunch, when you ponder giving it all up and live on a farm house in the Provence, the late evening rush when pressure arose, the ecstasy after tea, and so on…<br><br>For every type of work, there is the best (or "right") time to do it.<br><br>Since you travel through every type of time during each day, you should encounter the right moment for every type of work that got selected in the chain.</div>
