<div class="content">Qqueues has had  makeover and has a nice, clean look. I never really got into it before, I don't know why. I know some of the good people here use it for their AF / FV lists, and so I thought I'd mention it here.<br><br>The tags can be used to dot tasks (its quite easy to do), and any number of lists seem to be possible, including assigning tasks and collaborating.<br><br>I'm back on board with GQ and giving it a go.</div>

<div class="content">I use it, although I really wish there was a native android app rather than a mobile web version. No matter how well done, it's still not the same as the native one. Gqueues isn't as natural to use for FV as say, Wunderlist, but I really like having my tasks appear on Google calendar, and Gqueues does it better than any other software.</div>
