<div class="content">I really like FV. There are some good things I like but some other not. I like the AF look. I like the dots. <br><br>When I used AF I liked the dissmiss and it simplicity. With FV I am like I was with AF and it is simple to work on my stuff.<br><br>On another hand, when I used SF I liked the reporting of urgent and unfinished on the right column, but I did not like the right column itself.<br><br>Now I try to mixt the systems the find the best of them.<br>1. My idea is to keep FV including in my spiral notebook everything as the happen. Including notes. One after the other and keep the right column for decision about some items<br>2. My idea is also to put a star in front of all urgent task so they will be considered as dot and acted first<br>3. My last idea is to high line all task which are unfinished or to follow and decide what to do about them asap. <br>4. My last idea is not to pass to the following page until I did not work on urgencies or unfinished tasks<br>5. I keep the following list of my project on word pages <br>6. And the most important and complicated project on word pages.<br>7. OF will be reserved for future items</div>
