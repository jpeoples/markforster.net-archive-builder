<div class="content">Why does'nt FV have a formal dismissal process, like all other Mark's systems.<br><br>What if the input rate of new items exceedes the completion rate of the items in the list?<br><br>What if the lenght of the list increases to an extend that the preselection process of FV becomes very heavy, making the hall whole process unfeasible and making the system itself collapsed under the weight of a continuosly increasing log list of todo items?</div>

<div class="content">Nick,<br><br>It does: You dismiss the first item every time you scan the list.</div>

<div class="content">While I only worked with SF for a short while, I think the relevant point is this from FV: "If at any stage you find that a task is no longer relevant, then delete it."<br><br>The forcing function of always starting your chain with the first unactioned task causes you to engage with every item on the list and make a decision about it.  if one is truly overcommitted, you will be made aware of that fact and you can decide what to do about it. After iterating over the list for several cycles, my experience was that even 6 pages wasn't a burden for me and I got a lot of things done and off of the list and the things I added helped me do my work better. <br><br>Could you swamp it, probably, but then you know are in the process of or have overcommitted and you need to make the appropriate adjustments in life, not just to a list.</div>

<div class="content">@tom You said: "... omissis ... you know are in the process of or have overcommitted and you need to make the appropriate adjustments in life, not just to a list"..... this is a very good point!<br><br>Anyway, the fact is that Mr.Forster decided to eliminate the dismissal process from his last system (The dismissal of one item per scan doesn't have the same impact that other dismissal algorithms had in other Mark's systems).<br><br>Would be very interesting (at least for me...) to know the reason of this change directly from Mr.Forster.</div>
