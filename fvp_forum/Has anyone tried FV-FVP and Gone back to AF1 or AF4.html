<div class="content">I wonder if some one has tried FV or FVP and gone back to AF1 or AF4 <br>Why did you do it ? and more why choosing AF1 or AF4 for what reason(s) <br>Best to you.</div>

<div class="content">I tried out FV when it first came out. While I liked it to a certain point, I never could make it work for me. To have to choose more than one task at a time is just not for me. The same with other systems where I pre-determine a chain of actions to be taken - I don't strive on this.<br><br>After FV I went back to AF because I still liked it the most of all the Autofocus systems. I also thought: "heck, why shouldn't it work for me?" and then Mark posted on reverse AF1 which I liked even more. It's a good system.</div>

<div class="content">No, I went back to -- reverse AF1 --, not to -- AF2 --.<br><br>(But that was back then, at the moment I use Nolist-FVP.)<br><br>When I went back from FV to reverse AF1, I did so, because the FV chain did not work for me. The reason was because I had to choose more than one task at once. That led to procrastination.</div>
