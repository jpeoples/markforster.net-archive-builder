<div class="content">Three Point Final Version (TPFV)<br><br>TPFV is my attempt of working in a similar way to FV. In addition to the overall aims of FV, I believe it also has the following benefits: <br><br> It has an in-built frequent review process for items on the list. It works well in different contexts (e.g. at home and at work). It eliminates issues associated with building longer item chains. <br><br>Here are the 'three points' (Intended to be in the sense of 'navigation' or 'orientation' points): <br><br>POINT 1: ITEM(S) TO DEFINE OR DELETE (Go through items from beginning to end within the open list and define or delete items as necessary. Note: This can be done on every cycle or less often if preferred e.g. once daily or several times daily etc. <br><br>POINT 2: ITEM NEXT AVAILABLE. (Locate the first available item in the open list that could be done within the current context. This is the root item. Put a small dot next to it). <br><br>POINT 3: ITEM BEFORE THAT. (Locate one item to work on before the root item and put a small dot next to it). Cross through items when they have been worked on and re-enter items at the end of the list as necessary. <br><br>That's it! Rinse, wash, repeat. <br><br>Tip: (As in Autofocus) Close out the page by putting an 'X' in the top corner when there are no open items on the page.</div>

<div class="content">Leon,<br><br>If I understand what you are suggesting in Pt.3, it boils down to selecting a two-task chain always: the root plus something you want to do before the root. You didn't specify whether you stop searching the list after you find something, or keep going to the end to select the one task you want to do before anything else.<br><br>Pt. 2 – skipping past out-of-context tasks at the top without crossing them off – is what I always did when using FV.  It makes a lot more sense to me than crossing off and rewriting something that cannot be actioned due to context.<br><br>Pt. 1 – weeding the list frequently, with rephrasing as needed – is good advice in general for any system that uses a long "capture everything" list as the primary tool for task selection. And I agree that one probably doesn't want to do this on every pass. Once a day is probably sufficient.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Ubi:<br><br>< If I understand what you are suggesting in Pt.3, it boils down to selecting a two-task chain always: the root plus something you want to do before the root. You didn't specify whether you stop searching the list after you find something, or keep going to the end to select the one task you want to do before anything else. ><br><br>I stop searching the list after I find something. I then work on the 2 tasks only. I then select the next available root task along with the next item I want to work on before that. I have noticed that an urgent item appearing at the end of the list is not forgotten, so this works well for me at the moment.</div>

<div class="content">This seems to explicitly divide items into <br>(1) items that still need to be "defined or deleted" - does that mean something like the GTD process to determine the next action?<br>(2) next actions<br><br>I am intrigued by that distinction, because I'm finding myself returning to many GTD principles like this, and wondering if you are too.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Seraphim, <br><br>I too used GTD in the past. I think you are correct: I'm increasingly finding myself in need of greater clarity for items listed - just so I can break down the procrastination further and move forward - and this method creates the right circumstances for this.<br><br>The mechanism of FV is also there to help with selecting the right items to work on.</div>

<div class="content">It seems to me like this method puts a much greater emphasis on addressing your oldest items. <br><br>When working in "regular" FV I tend to "define or delete" as I go... items in need of clarification stand out, get included in the chain, and get addressed in whatever way necessary when I process the chain. I delete/file (I use Evernote) items as I go through the list selecting the chain as well.<br><br>I have experimented with limiting chains to three items during times when the oldest items on my list have really needed my attention but since I generally make it through my list 3-4 times in an average workday, I ultimately abandoned that experiment.</div>
