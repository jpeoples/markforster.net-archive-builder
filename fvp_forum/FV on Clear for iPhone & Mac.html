<div class="content">Hello,<br><br>I use Clear with FV on both iPhone and Mac.<br><a href="http://www.realmacsoftware.com/clear/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.realmacsoftware.com/clear/</a><br><br>1) Make a list of todos in Clear.<br>2) Add a divider with straight lines –––––––––––––––<br>3) Move it below your first task.<br>4) Ask: What do you want to do before X? Just move those tasks above the first.<br>5) Complete tasks.<br>6) Move divider below the next task and repeat.<br><br>Clear has the advantage of moving tasks up and down very quickly. Paper doesn't.<br>So instead of going from below and up, marking stuff with dots. Just set them in order.<br>Check them off when completed. When you reach the divider, start over again.<br><br>With Clear on Mac, you can use the keyboard etc. Have it always visible on the desktop.<br>Clear on iPhone, I use mainly for getting things done but also adding quick stuff.<br><br>Here is two example images to demonstrate:<br><br>1) <a href="http://fake.is/LxS1" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://fake.is/LxS1</a><br>2) <a href="http://fake.is/LxWO" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://fake.is/LxWO</a><br><br>About the way described in method 1 and 2 in this forum.<br>My way is easier, but might not work well with 300 tasks? I would never be able to finish that many in a few days anyways. Got a project structure in Things (you could use any type of todo software) to keep organised. I just use everything that comes to mind with FV, which helps to motivate me.</div>

<div class="content">Like it!  I use a notebook at work, but have Clear on my phone and have used it for capturing Home things, but haven't really been "working" it.  This might help.  Thanks,</div>

<div class="content">I used Clear when I used an iPad, which I no longer do.<br><br>Clear IS good, the closest I've come across on Android is AnyDo, although koalkat's Clear is allegedly a rip-off copy for Android users.<br><br>I am hoping the real Clear developer will do a proper Android version, but I suspect not.  I like the ability in Android (my Galaxy Note 2 has replaced my stolen S2) to write on the screen.</div>
