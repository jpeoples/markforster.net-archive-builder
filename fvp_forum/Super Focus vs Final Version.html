<div class="content">F.V.; because "what would I do before I do X" is sheer genius.</div>

<div class="content">I just commented on SF vs FV here, in the final paragraph:<br><a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/fv-forum/post/1760271#item1760508" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/fv-forum/post/1760271#item1760508</a></div>

<div class="content">FV is far easier on the mind. There's no sizing up tasks, debates whether to continue, worries of a task getting lost, agony over having to complete C2 to meet arbitrary commitments, confusion over where to write the task, painful dismissal.  And it still let's you focus on both important and urgent tasks!  (I didn't like SF.)</div>

<div class="content">As excellent as SF was, I found that each I time I tried to implement it, it was only a day or two before resistance  - and thus procrastination/lethargy et al - started to kick in. I've now been using FV for nearly five days and can honestly say that the dreaded resistance has shown no sign of rearing its ugly head yet. So far, I'm impressed without measure by Final Version! It's beautiful in its simplicity and a joy in its application. Thank you, Mark!</div>

<div class="content">I've just realized:<br><br>Remember in AF/SF, the technique of making decisions by writing down several options and then doing the one that stood out first? The old example was "Buy red notebook / Buy blue notebook."<br><br>Well, I'd been assuming that no longer works in FV, just because it was my first impression when I read the instructions and noticed that "standing out" was gone. That was before I'd even finished reading the instructions for the first time, and before I'd used the system at all.<br><br>So I was stuck on that notion, but tonight I used the technique inadvertently when I wrote the next step for a project and then changed my mind, and then changed it again. There were three options written down, and I'm still not sure which way I want to go, so I'll wait until one of them answers "what do I want to do before x?"<br><br>So FV does have a bit of standing-out after all.</div>

<div class="content">1. Everyday with FV I make multiple passes through my list.<br>With SF it was not unusual to make one pass through my list and linger on the last page (the page where I was freer to do whatever I wanted).<br><br>2. Everyday with FV I have about two open days (even though I started with my SF list). I anticipate that that could increase a day or two when times get intense and very busy.<br>With SF I committed to having no more than seven open days open, though occasionally I would exceed that number. That meant that it was not unusual to have a high-resistance item remain untouched for a week.<br><br>3. Because of 1 and 2, with FV I do a lot of little and often. <br>With SF I did a lot of little and a little of often.<br><br>(This is not to say, as others have pointed out, that I can't work for a long block of time on one thing in FV. I can. The thing is that I am a lot more efficient during the other times with FV than I was with SF.)</div>
