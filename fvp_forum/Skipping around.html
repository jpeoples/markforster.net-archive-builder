<div class="content">What happens if we come up with an urgent task? We move it to the end of the list and dot it. It's something we don't want to do, so we use the little and often principle? Do we keep scratching it off and adding it?</div>

<div class="content">How urgent is it?<br><br>If it takes 2 minutes and should be done immediately, then stop and do it immediately, then resume.<br>If it takes a bit longer and must be done today, write it on the list and pick it up on your next pass through the list.<br>If that isn't enough, then write it on the list, dot it, and pick it up now.<br><br>If you don't do it all at once, yes keep dotting, doing, scratching, and reentering.</div>

<div class="content">.Assuming you mean something like your boss saying "I want that report on my desk by close of play today":<br><br>Write the task with a dot at the end of the list.<br>Do some work on it.<br>Re-enter it without a dot<br>Work on the remaining dotted tasks until you feel ready to give the report another go<br>Dot it<br>Work on it<br>Repeat until task finished.</div>
