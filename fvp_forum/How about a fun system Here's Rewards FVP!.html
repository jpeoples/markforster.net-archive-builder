<div class="content">Mark Forster mentioned Reverse FVP in the comments of the "No Question FVP" blog post from which I had the start of an idea for a different kind of reverse FVP, and here is the result after refining it for some days.  As the name suggests, Rewards FVP starts with determining what reward you want to give yourself, and then encourages you to receive it after doing enough work.<br><br>1.  Determine what reward you want to give yourself after a certain period of work.  Write this down at the end of your list enclosed in slashes /like this/.<br>2.  Go back to the start of your list and process it using the rules of FVP or any of its variants with your reward (written at the end of the list) acting as the first dotted task.  <br>3.  When you come to your reward task, receive it, erase it from the list, and go back to step 1.</div>

<div class="content">You could also specify a reward for every time you succeed in doing the root task in normal FVP.</div>

<div class="content">@Mark Forster: That is one thing that has always bothered me about FVP: the root task. More often that not it is not relevant to the day and is something that I often don't even want to do. FVP's root task thus often feels like a punishment for doing work. In this variation at least my root task is something I want to do in the first place.</div>

<div class="content">nuntym:<br><br>The following excerpt from the FVP rules would apply to the root task not being relevant to the day.<br><br>"If at any stage you find that a task on the list is no longer relevant, then delete it. If you find that your preselected list is no longer relevant (e.g. if you have had a long break away from the list or some new factor has come into play), then scrap the preselection and reselect from the beginning. [Afternote July 3rd - I now don’t do this. I simply cross out any tasks which need re-prioritizing and re-enter them at the end of the  list.]"<br><br>As far as the root task being something you don't even want to do, what's the point of only giving yourself rewards for the stuff you want to do anyway?</div>

<div class="content">If the reward isn't in the work itself, then I don't think the system would be sustainable. I think this is why Mark's systems have such drawing power and sustained results - they help you discover the work that's really important to you - as well as helping you get it done.</div>
