<div class="content">Here's a simple variation on the 5T method in "The Secrets of Productive People". I haven't been using it long so it's too early to report back on it in detail, but it seems to be a flexible and easy-to-use "no list" system. I'm describing it here in case anyone else would like to have a go at it.<br><br>1. Write a list of 5 tasks.<br>2. Do the tasks in any order.<br>3. Do not add or re-enter any tasks to the list until you have only one task left.<br>4. When you have only one task left, add four further tasks to the list.<br>5. Earlier tasks may be re-entered at this stage, but count towards the four.</div>

<div class="content">Mark: <br>I guess, "do" in 2. means "do some work on, not necessarily until completion"?<br><br>Gonna try this.<br><br>Is this the first part of "Since writing the above I have developed a very simple refinement on the time management system in "Secrets of Productive People" which I have designed specifically for this notebook, together with a system of reminders and a method of breaking down larger tasks.", ,and are the other parts still to come?</div>

<div class="content">I think I can now see why Mark is saying he can combine a variation of 5T with journaling. Because 5T can occupy so little of a page it can be inserted in the middle of the journal and continue journaling. So that the 5T will not be lost in all the journal stuff, one can, for example, enclose the 5T in a box (as Mark hinted in the original thread).<br><br>By doing this the journal can potentially become the most comprehensive time and task management system, since one can brainstorm, take note of information, write diary entries, manage projects, handle reminders, etc there.</div>

<div class="content">I'll give it a go then. I have been experimenting with combining FVP with journaling anyways. It is gloriously messy, so maybe combining this version of 5T with journaling will work also. In the meantime I am waiting on the other parts of this system, Mark.<br><br>I am going to point the people who are in the "Back to FVP" thread into his one, as they might want to look at this.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for directing me here, nuntym. <br><br>I very much like the idea of combining 5T with journaling/notes on the same page. <br><br>My instinct is telling me this could work well for me. And part of the attraction of 5T in the first place (for an obsessive list maker like me) was that it told me to trust my gut more than a stale list.</div>

<div class="content">I went back to FVP, which seems more satisfying for me.  However, I still combine journaling with FVP in a single notebook.  It is just so gloriously messy and fun!<br><br>The rules I use are easy: <br>1. I always date the first line I write for the day<br>2. Contiguous entries that are not tasks (i.e. journal entries) are enclosed in drawn boxes.<br>3. Journal entries may or may not be treated as tasks; that is, if I want to I can mark them per the rules of FVP, but I do not have to mark the oldest journal entry as the first task of an FVP chain.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the variation on the 5T method Mark. I'm constantly trying to find a way to combine my tasks with my notes and I hope this will help. <br><br>In the past I have used 3T - to indicate the list by first drawing a vertical line in the page margin / left side of page - I made the line to span around 12 lines  - the estimate can be adjusted with practice obviously - plus a new line can be quickly drawn in if the previous one is filled. I use the dots and score through symbols too. (Love them).</div>
