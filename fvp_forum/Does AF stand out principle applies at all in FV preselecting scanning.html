<div class="content">I wondered whether AF stand out principle applies at all in FV preselecting. Mark's FV algorithm in 13 March 2012 email, did not mention standing out at all.<br><br>I also re-read Mark's AF standing out clarifcation <a href="../blog/Clarification Standing Out.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2009/1/6/clarification-standing-out.html</a> .<br><br>Could we split the "what do I want to do before X?" question into two parts scanning query?<br>(1) When a task stand out as what I "want" to do now then only,<br>(2) consider whether to "do before X"?<br><br><br>The above may be applicable to how Seraphim described FV scanning process in <a href="../fvp_forum/Struggling Standing Out keeps trying to take over.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/fv-forum/post/1774589</a> ...<br><<  the "what do I want to do before X?" question. This process is much faster -- scan quickly down the list, and dot the things that jar you enough to stop scanning >><br><br>Sarah FV video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3Qauv4kgR8" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3Qauv4kgR8</a> showed it as one step query by summarising the benchmark X task into a word. So "kids art to office" becomes "art" hence "what do I want to do before art?". Or even just "before art?"</div>

<div class="content">Mark made it clear in a previous post that scanning for "what to do before X" is NOT the same as "standing out".   Standing out is more ponderous.   The FV question is meant to be faster.   That's what led to me writing what you quoted above:<br><br><< This process is much faster -- scan quickly down the list, and dot the things that jar you enough to stop scanning >><br><br>I was basically re-wording what Mark had already written in a post.<br><br>Sorry I can't seem to find the post right now...  :-)</div>

<div class="content">I don't really know the difference, as ignorant as that may sound. I do know that with FV, the choices I make have more to do with:<br><br>(a)  how heavy the commitment is in relation to the chosen chain, given the time I have. So I'm far more aware of time constraints;<br><br>(b) I know I want to choose the best chain I can within the limits of my cognitive ability (sometimes things just get missed), so I'm more aware of what is urgent at that point in time;<br><br>(c)  I want to try to get through at least 2 or more chains (not a hard rule), so I am aware that I should not mix too many hard tasks, or at least I end up choosing easier task to make the hard task more palatable.<br><br>That's far more than I could ever write about when compared to AF and what  it means for something to "stand out".</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim and JD, thanks for your comments. Picking up on ...<br><< Standing out is more ponderous.

Instead wait for a feeling of release about an item. It’s hard to describe but easy to recognise. You just feel that the item is ready to be done. >><br><br>The above AF stands out seems less ponderous than FV question. Maybe for me, a feel is lighter than a comparison.<br><br>If I model my split second FV "what do I want to do before X?" question as this pseudocode ...<br><br>FOR EACH TASK<br>..IF "I want to do" THEN<br>....IF "do before X?" THEN<br>......DOT TASK<br>....ENDIF<br>..ENDIF<br>ENDFOR<br><br>The first IF may feel like AF stands out.<br>The second IF may feel lighter.<br><br>Could be I have a problem trying to consider WANT and BEFORE simultaneously instead of sequentially?</div>

<div class="content">I think 'before' is much more important than 'want'.  If we didn't want to do the task at least at some level when it was written, it likely wouldn't be on the list.  The process of building the chain is all about choosing/creating the order in which to do things.<br><br>For me, if I spend too much time thinking about a task when building a ladder, I get bogged down and overwhelmed.  It's probably because the 'standing out' starts to take affect and the mental load increases compared tojust choosing what to do 'before' X.<br><br>The 'want' or 'before' issue was discussed a bit in some other posts.</div>
