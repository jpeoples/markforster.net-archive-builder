<div class="content">Inspired by Mark's testing of No-List Autofocus, I'm attempting a modification of FVP (which may have been made already). Prior to this, I've been using 5T pretty consistently for about two months and am happy with the results.<br><br>1. New tasks may be added at any time, but must be worked on immediately.<br>2. Besides that, the normal FVP rules hold, using the "What do I want to do before X?" question.<br>3. When marking off a chain, it's a natural extension of the "What do I want to do before X?" to add new tasks.<br><br>So far, using it one day, I've noticed that it provides a lot more focus on the hard projects that I have committed to and seems significantly more flexible than 5T or FVP. I'm starting my list from scratch since I have a new notebook, but will let everyone know how it goes.<br><br>An addition I'm thinking about adding is to allow a scan from the last dot instead of just the last dot completed in cases where significant resistance is felt.</div>

<div class="content">Can you please use another name? No-List FVP is already taken.</div>

<div class="content">Sure. I assume Active FVP isn't taken?</div>

<div class="content">I think that's taken already. (Joking) FV3 might be though -- see my separate post.</div>
