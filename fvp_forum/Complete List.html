<div class="content">Hi,<br>I'm slightly irritated, if it is necessary for the FV algorithm to read the complete list form the first undone entry to the end got generate the task-chain?<br>This could probably be very annoying if the list is very long?!<br>- Jens</div>

<div class="content">Yes it is very possible. This is why it's suggested to start with a short list, and why I aim to keep the list short. Nevertheless, if the list became long, a single scan would select more tasks, and you would take longer to do all those. Which means, it may take 10 minutes to go through, but that will be trivial compared to the time spent doing all those tasks you selected.</div>

<div class="content">A 'short list' to me means an incomplete list.  What are the suggestions for the rest of the items that are not added in an effort to keep it short?  <br><br>My mind dump yesterday pulled out 138 items - not everything is currently actionable, but certainly 100 of those items would be.</div>

<div class="content">Pretend you are about to do a GTD Weekly Review or some other ungodly time-management exercise, complete with procrastinating by going to the bathroom, weeding the garden, and verifying that no light bulbs need changing.<br><br>Then, instead, spend ten minutes scanning your entire list. Mine was well over 100 items but is now at 75, including some 20-30 new items added to the end of the list. I find the scans are very quick, as I am pretty familiar with my list. I've never timed myself, but it can't be taking more than five minutes.</div>

<div class="content">My FV list currently has the remains of rotating lists for recurring items:<br>Rotating Lists: <a href="../general_forum/Rotating Lists for Recurring Tasks.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1583554</a><br>(Bad description of a good system.)<br><br>I like the way it's working. The bottom half is entirely things that aren't due yet -- easy to scan. My old weekly list is my first FV page, so weekly tasks are getting a lot of attention right now. That would be different if it were in the middle, though I'd still benefit from seeing all the weekly tasks in one place and knowing if I were keeping up.<br><br>However, maintaining those sub-lists would be a tweak to FV. Mark has asked that we not tweak the system for a while, so instead of my old way of writing the recurrence at the bottom of the sub-list, I'll write it at the end of the big list. It's easy enough to go back if it doesn't work, and chances are it will work just fine.</div>

<div class="content">One may try working with the last seven days or some such suitable number. As progress is made, one can slowly bite off more. Ultimately, I expect that FV will result in a relatively short list.</div>

You certainly don't have much of an MF-FV System anymore.  If you don't clean it up at all, then there's a chance of really important and urgent items being buried and too many un-actionable  items (I know this is debatable).  <br><br>I like to think back at when I had too many side lists, or too many someday's.  Then, the out-of-sight-out-of-mind (OSOM) effect kicked in and I just ignored them, and worst of all, they created clutter (both physically and mentally).<br><br>There must be some sort of middle ground for tasks.  I remember that dragging related tasks onto each other in OmniFocus simply makes sub-tasks out of them.  Of course, everybody knows this, but the point is that once you collapse these groups, the rest of your list is shorter and more manageable, and the other important and urgent items stand out faster.  Also, seeing the items grouped is healthy in some cases because it gives perspective and helps with sequence/prerequisites.  <br><br>I also don't want to be forced to re-write too many un-doable tasks at the end.  (Being "out of context" is a whole other (but related) issue.)<br><br>One time Jupiter came up with a Current Project List (CPL).  A separate list of projects would act as a good reminder and allow you to scribble notes, priorities, symbols, etc. on it.  Treat it like a checklist or whatever; the main thing is you wouldn't forget.<br><br>A CPL might also be useful to remind you of the different "places" things are, both digitally (OneNote, EverNote, Omni, etc.) and on paper (notebooks, folders, in FV, etc.).<br><br>On the other hand, I also liked nuntym's simple suggestion in the "Someday, Maybe" thread (<a href="../fvp_forum/Someday, maybe list.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/fv-forum/post/1757306</a> ): "Cross out the item you want to dismiss but add something to distinguish it from a deleted item. In my practice I place a "D" at the end." <br><br>So, I think the answer for "the other things" lies somewhere in the grey area of "when you +really+ need to do something to make your system more effective," but always trying to keep moving un-done tasks out to a minimum (and avoiding coming up with yet other ways to complicate your system).  <br><br>Some of these "other things" could include: <br> - the things Alan mentioned (projects, tickler (scheduled/time blocks), routines (and checklists)),<br> - contexts (people, out-and-about, waiting-for, etc.), and <br> - the dreaded someday/maybe's.</div>

<div class="content">Towards the end of my experimenting with the system I had two possible questions:<br><br>"Do I want to do this before x?" <br><br>(x being the current benchmark, and "this" being the task I am currently compariing with it.)<br><br>"What do I want to do before I do x?"<br><br>I chose the second for the simple reason that it was a lot faster to scan using it. With the first question I had to pause at each item and ask the question. With the second I could just zoom down the list until something caught my eye. Basically i was assuming that I didn't want to do anything before x unless something thrust itself into my consciousness.<br><br>I suspect those who are worried about the length of time a scan takes may be interpreting the second question as if it were the first.</div>

<div class="content">I've read the rules and nearly all of the FV Forum and never picked up on this!  I was asking "Do I want to do this before x?"   The couple of times I found myself thinking of what I wanted to do before X and "corrected" myself.  <br><br>While they are very similar, they have very different feel and speed as Mark notes.  So FV might be even better than I thought now that I know the right question.</div>

<div class="content">@vegheadjones:<br><br>I think I now realize why it's taking me so long.   I find I am frequently rewriting the tasks to make it easier to quickly assess the "what do I want to do before X?" question.   <br><br>The way I have these set up in OneNote currently doesn't make it very easy to scan so quickly.   A lot of the items are just emails sent to OneNote, or web pages sent to OneNote, and the title of the item is not always very clear, forcing me to glance at the contents of the item.  When I was pausing on each one and assessing whether it "stood out", this was fine.  But for the much quicker "do before?" question, there's no time to glance at the contents if I intend to move quickly.</div>

<div class="content">I don't edit the titles for clarity, during the input process, that would slow me down too much, or during the scan process. If I don't know what an item is (usually because it is an imported email) and the desire to know what it is is greater than the previous selected task it goes on the preselect list.  When I get to it on the preselect list, I either start it, to it, redefine it or delete it.</div>

<div class="content">Alan:  << edit the titles, for clarity! >> <br><br>Yes, that's what I've been doing.  Sometimes on the fly, sometimes by preselecting it like Vegheadjones says.<br><br>In addition to helping speed up the selection process, it also forces me to think through the "next action" on the item.  It only takes a few seconds and helps so much.   It also helps to eliminate dross when I realize there ISN'T any next action.  :-)</div>

<h2>Reply by Cricket</h2>

<div class="content">I don't think you should stop pre-selecting and start working. Something you really want to do before anything else might be at the end.<br><br>Having said that, if I see more than 7 dots in my list I wonder if I reverted to "want to do today" or "want to do more than" rather than "want to do before the previous dot". Those old habits are hard to break. Early days yet, and those numbers might change, but those are my current warning signs -- not goals, not targets, not maximums, just warning signs that I might have reverted. If I think I have, the only solution is erase all the dots and start over. I've only done it once (probably should have done it several times), and found not only did I choose fewer items, I chose different ones -- a sure sign I was asking the wrong question.<br><br>Sometimes I need to ask myself, "How badly do I want to do Y before X?" If it's just a little, I call it measurement error and don't dot it.<br><br>Note: As near as I can tell, Mark doesn't want to put a maximum size on the list. He's used it longer than anyone, so I'll follow his guidance.<br><br>I'm also curious. Do others find the same pattern, that using the right question results in a shorter list? If so, what length is your warning sign?</div>

<div class="content">If you feel that it is time to quit the preselection session then that is exactly the right moment to do it. Nevertheless, I do suggest that you do finish scanning the rest of the list, as a visual feedback for what is still on the plate. It doesn't hurt and you might compile the next preselection even faster.<br><br>Keep in mind that various internal and external factors do influence the way you do preselect the tasks, even if you are not actively aware of it. Don't add any further rules. Just follow the flow and your intuition.</div>

<div class="content">A few times, I got bored doing the preselection and wanted to get started.  So I just started.   It worked fine.   It helped me from getting bogged down in too many nuanced narrow comparisons between items that are hard to say which one I want to do first.  It seems to happen a lot with my (still) long list.<br><br>This doesn't break any rules, because, in theory, I could write "Get started already!" at the end of the list, and dot it, and start working the preselected list.  The result would be exactly the same as just stopping the preselection process and starting to work.</div>

<div class="meta">2012-03-20 22:25</div>
<div class="content">Hi Cricket,<br><br>Yes, I do use the wording you describe.   But it still ends up creating many nuanced comparisons.  <br><br>Let's say my list is ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVQXYZ.<br><br>I put a dot next to A.  Then I scan for "what do I want to do before A?"   Let's say A is a major work-related task that I've been resisting.  OK, my mind is now thinking about "work" and "I don't want to do this, almost anything else would be better to do first".   So I find myself preselecting B.<br><br>Now I scan for "what do I want to do before B?"   Let's say B is a personal phone call, but I'm on work time, so I really should be avoiding personal items.  C is a moderately challenging work item with little resistance.   I want to do it before B, since I'm in "working mode".  So I put a dot next to C.   <br><br>I scan now for "what do I want to do before C?"    I get all the way to K before I find something.  Let's say K is some really urgent work task, but to do it at all, I need to spend half an hour on it.   And let's say K reminds me of a bunch of tasks related to IT that I need to deal with.   K gets a dot.  And now I'm primed to be thinking about my IT-related tasks.<br><br>I find P, which is also IT-related, and I want to do it before K.   P is a very interesting article that I've been wanting to read, and it will actually help me finish K more effectively, and will only take 5 minutes.   So P gets a dot.<br><br>But now I'm thinking about other things I'd like to read, and am not really thinking so much about urgent IT tasks any more.   I find T and am about to dot it, because I want to read it very much, and probably before P.  But now I realize I am taking too long to do this preselection and have already got plenty of urgent tasks to accomplish.  Need to get started already!!   So I decide to add "get started now!!" to the end and dot it.  And get the preselection taken care of!!<br><br>Anyway, this is a little exaggerated but that's how my comparisons happen sometimes.  It would be really hard to make a case that T > P > K > C > B > A, where ">" equates to some uniform criterion.   In reality, it actually means something slightly different in each comparison.</div>

<div class="content">But that's kind of irrelevant, you have a list of stuff that needs doing and you're just selecting a subset of stuff that you think needs doing first.<br><br>This (to me) needless what-if-ism is just unproductive nit-picking. Does FV produce an optimal ordering of tasks based on some uniform criterion? No. But who said you have to have a uniform criterion at all. Pick a few tasks and JFDI.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br>I kind of agree with Ed. You're putting far too much thought into this. I would just have dotted A, then whammed down the list until I found something that was mentally flashing a red stop light at me, and so on to the end. Your aim is not to produce an optimal ordering (as if such a thing exists) but to construct a ladder which leads you into getting A done (and hopefully getting quite a bit of useful work done on the way).</div>

<div class="content">Good feedback, Mark and Ed, thanks!   Actually I'm not putting much conscious thought into the decision process at all -- this is simply the mental process that "happens" when I ask the "what do I want to do before X?"  question.   This is just the way my mind works.  LOL     <br><br>I'll try to wham down the list looking for that red light.   Maybe I'll rephrase the question:  "what do I REALLY REALLY want to do before X?"   or   "what have I just GOT to do before I do X?"  to prevent me from leaning too much in the other direction:  "what do I sorta maybe might want to do before X?"   since that seems to be what I'm doing.   :-)</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim,<br><br>I have experienced the same wandering focus while preselecting tasks, in that once I've dotted something quick and fun, then the fun has driven from my mind the urgencies I dotted earlier, so I end up dotting things that I don't want to do before the original benchmark, even though I might want to do them (in a vacuum) before the fun thing.<br><br>The key phrase is "in a vacuum." I've solved this by reminding myself that "what I want to do before x" is not to be construed in a vacuum, but in the context of this morning, with the amount of time I have right now before the next thing on my schedule. If I've made a long chain, it helps to pause and remind myself of some of the more urgent things on it. It is important not to turn this into a rational sorting exercise, just to keep my current schedule and situation as an intuitive frame of reference.<br><br>I think this problem will seem completely alien to some people, but obviously not to you and me!

<div class="content">Regarding cleaning up the list to keep it to a reasonable size, I put anything that isn't urgent and I probably won't have time to look at in the next week or two into Google Calendar, with an email reminder set.  I pick a day, fairly roughly, closer to when I think I'll have time to do something about it.  When I get the email reminder, I put the task on the list.<br><br>So Google Calendar functions as a kind of tickler file, or someday list - nothing gets forgotten entirely, because eventually Google will remind me about it, and then I either put it on the list so I can do it or I decide to scrap it completely.<br><br>What remains in my list are tasks that I intend to do something about in the next couple of weeks or so.  That includes no more than the next couple of actions for mutli-task projects.</div>

<div class="content">Taking the "wham down the list looking for that red light" approach, I'm finding that each preselection batch tends to follow a "theme".  <br><br>For example, if the first item is a "fun" item, then I tend to find other "fun" or "light" items.   I end up choosing a handful of those, and get them done.<br><br>The next time around is more of an "administrivia round".<br><br>The next round is more "odds and ends that push some projects forward".<br><br>Interesting.</div>
