<div class="content">It is not uncommon, and it means that you have lots of items that you are not resisting (i.e. almost every taks you meet in your list is the next thing you want to do)<br><br>It either means that you're in the flow of doing things, or you filled up your list with unimportant tasks that make you drift. If the tasks on your list are all important, well, it's a good thing.<br><br>About whether it's better to have a long chain or many short ones, I prefer having rather short chains (no more than 4 items), but I'm not the one taking the decision. It's a result of asking the question "What to I want to do before this?".</div>
