<div class="content">I have been using Todoist (upgraded to the Premium version) for about two years.<br><br>It has a 'Karma' feature which awards points to doing stuff on time, deducting points when tasks get too old.  It does act as a kind of an incentive.<br><br>My current Todoist setup is a bit overwrought, however I think I can revamp and simplify it to create two FVP lists, Work and Personal.  Then I can work the lists according to FVP.<br><br>I prefer electronic solutions, if only because it saves rewriting, however I do recall that writing tasks in Mark's very first solution (AF1) in late 2008 was worthwhile.<br><br>If a Todoist adaptation does not work, I might try OneNote, it's free these days.</div>
