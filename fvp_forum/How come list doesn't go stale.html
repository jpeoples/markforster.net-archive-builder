<div class="content">Hi, <br>I would like to start using the FVP. I looked at the rules and other information but there is still something I don't undertand.<br><br>The process assumes that after have your selected list and you do an item before you do the next item you need to see if there is something else that you want to do before it.<br>So you scan through the list, not from the top but from the logical spot where you already know that before this point there is nothing I want to do more than "x".<br><br>My question is that this was true at the time that you scanned and created the list of selected items. after hours or maybe days this would no longer would be true. Maybe there are items on the list earlier that now would take precedence and even though when you created the pre-selected list you didn't care to do now you would want to do it.<br><br>Hope I wasn't to confusing.<br><br>Thanks<br><br>Steven</div>

<div class="content">It does say in the rules for FVP:<br><br>"If at any stage you find that a task on the list is no longer relevant, then delete it. If you find that your preselected list is no longer relevant (e.g. if you have had a long break away from the list or some new factor has come into play), then scrap the preselection and reselect from the beginning. [Afternote July 3rd - I now don’t do this. I simply cross out any tasks which need re-prioritizing and re-enter them at the end of the  list.]"<br><br>Personally, I start each day by scrapping the preselected list from yesterday and rewriting them at the end of the master list.  That makes everything fresh and relevant.</div>

<div class="content">thanks nuntym,<br><br>I think that redoing it whenever the list might have lost its relevancy is a good idea.<br><br>Steven</div>

<div class="content">I scrap my chain often... though less than I did with original FV (which, for me, is a strength of this system). But anytime my context changes (I move from work to home or home to work, the family come home, etc., or I'm away from the list for a while), I just scrap the chain, rewrite the items at the end of the list (rephrasing if I want to), and build a new chain.</div>

<div class="content">At the start of the day and several times during the day I just dump a few items that are in my mind at that moment onto the end of the list, and then process downwards from the bottom of the existing selection in the normal way. I don't feel the need to scrap the existing selection.<br><br>I'm planning to deal with the problem of list bloat (which isn't a problem for many others, it seems) by ditching or rewriting tasks that are more than a month old in bulk.</div>
