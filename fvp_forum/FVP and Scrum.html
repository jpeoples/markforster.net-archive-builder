<div class="content">Did anybody combine FVP (individual workload) with Scrum (obligations arised from project team). I don't mean simple method of puting tasks from lean/agile board into fvp, but rather some consolidated approach.</div>

<div class="content">Navigare -<br><br>I've used it when I was a Scrum Product Owner, especially when the backlog would get too long. The FVP algorithm is great for finding and sorting your top priorities very quickly and effectively. <br><br>I've also used it with a Kanban team, to help prioritize their work items when the WIP would get out of control. For example, there might be 15 items in the "in progress" column, when really we want 3-5 max. When there are so many work items, it's not easy to see which ones should be completed first. FVP can help sort that out.<br><br>Is that the kind of thing you had in mind?</div>
