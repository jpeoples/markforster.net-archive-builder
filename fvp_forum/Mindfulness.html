<div class="content">To successfully following any time management system, it is necessary to be continually mindful of how it's working for you.  Based on what you observe, you must adjust your working habits and your adaptation of the system to meet what is needed.  By consistently following this principle of mindfulness you can make a good system work for you.  Or you can discern that a system isn't suitable and why.  <br><br>I believe that FV can be a good system for most people if they are vigilant in this way.  Pay attention to what you want to achieve, and adjust your use of the list and its contents to better reach that goal.  (Reducing clutter is one tool for adjustment.)<br><br>By neglecting continued mindfulness, any system can slowly deteriorate without your notice until it becomes out of shape and broken.</div>

<div class="content">Agreed, almost. Wanted to add that "results" should include not just quantity of tasks but how you FEEL about what you're achieving - the aim for me is to feel productive, without wasted effort, but achieving the right pace for my mood, time for re-balancing and reflecting on the mix of activity vs rest and play. For me I have to make a deliberate decision to include fun, play and rest in the list. I believe research shows that 40 mins of work followed by a few minutes rest gives the best achievement</div>
