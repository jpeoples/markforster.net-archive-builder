<div class="content">I used the system as much as I could but I end being exhausted and a little stressed at the end of the day.<br>When should I take pauses from the system ? Should I decide to use the system during work hours and call "free time" the rest ?<br>Should I write "make pause" in the system ? But what should it really mean since I also write the fun things I want to do in the system... ?<br><br>Well, is there a way to manage the strain caused by a continuous use of the system ? And how should we define pauses without feeling stress to pause from the system ?</div>

<div class="content">I tend to get stressed and exhaust myself too when following a system. Lots of safeguards I have put into place: "rest", "take a walk", etc, are always on my list. I take tea breaks at work (twice a day, when the whole place also takes a break). I always take a lunch break and I have a 5-minute walk in the afternoon. And I try to remember to pause and take a couple of deep breaths between tasks. ("Breathe" sometimes is on my list.) Sometimes I listen to a song between tasks. I suggest you put on everything you can think of to try and relax, then see what works best. Getting stressed is no fun. :/</div>

<div class="content">isd:<br><br>I put plenty of leisure, rest and fun activities into my list, but inevitably there comes a time when just ticking things off the list  becomes a  major drudge in itself. When that happens just put the list away and go off and do things without any system for the rest of the day. When you come back to it the next day, you will find the system has gained its freshness again.</div>

<div class="content">I set certain hours for the list, and the rest is up to me. Often, I'll do things that are on the list anyways (especially since it includes things I want to do), but I'm free to pick them at random, without asking the question. It's an extra thrill to cross them off next morning -- work got done for free.</div>

<div class="content">Thank you for your answers.<br>I already put fun things on the list but as Mark says, just ticking things off becomes a drudge in itself. I'll try to take time off the list. I guess a few hours or even half a day without the list may be a solution. I feel that after such time i would even feel the urge to look at the list again.<br>And I guess it is okay to act freely on things that may be on the list during these "pauses"...</div>
