<div class="content">Firstly, my thanks to Mark for his new system. Mark, I don’t want to sound gushy, but I believe your work saves people’s sanity, careers and self-respect.<br><br>Personally, I'm rather excited about the 'structured procrastination' aspect of FV. <br><br>Procrastination has been my number-one self-management problem all my life. I'd generally much rather be on the beach, skipping rope with seaweed, than doing whatever I'm 'supposed' to be doing.<br><br>FV may hold an answer by focusing on what I 'want' to do rather than what I 'must' do. <br><br>It appears that getting the psychology of time management right is crucial. <br><br>If the psychology is not right, it is easy to ignore the mechanics of the system - and go back to skipping rope, with eyes screwed firmly shut against the consequences.<br><br>Right. I'm off now to choose what I 'want' to do, FV-style, and then - gulp - actually do it.</div>
