<div class="content">I am using SuperFocus at the moment and one of its features that I like is that once you get big task started (say Monthly accounting), you can do just a bit of it and it gets reentered to the next page that you are guaranteed to work on soon. Thus it encourages you to work on a big task until it's done, but still allows you to do just a bit of a project at a time.<br><br>What's FV approach to it?<br>Do you just reenter the "remainings" of Monthly accounting to the end of a list and hope it will get into the next preselection list? Even if the whole list of your tasks is real long?</div>

<div class="content">Correct.  But also you are permitted to readd a task to your preselection before you clear out everything.</div>

<div class="content">Alan is correct.   FV does handle Little and Often very well, but without forcing it on you like SF does.    This forcing function is what eventually caused many people to abandon SF  (as was discussed some time ago on these forums).<br><br>Some additional thoughts, since I have unfortunate personal experience with very long lists....<br><br>Long lists will bog down SuperFocus even more than they bog down Final Version.    With a long list, I would eventually start many projects without finishing them, relying on the Little and Often principle to get them done.    But Column 2 would fill up with too many tasks that HAD to get action with every turn of the page.   <br><br>Even 3 or 4 or 5 items in Column 2 can seriously slow down the system.   I would find myself with 8 or 10 items or more, and that would make the system unworkable.   It could take me several hours, or all day, just to work through a single Column 2 on a single page.<br><br>As a result, the list of my ordinary tasks in Column 1 would grow longer and longer and not get attention.<br><br>So, I'd add some of them as "urgent" items to Column 2 , to make sure they got faster attention.  But of course, this only made the Column 2 Overload problem worse.<br><br>(There are lots of discussions on Column 2 Overload...)<br><br>SuperFocus is very effective, but it has no effective mechanism for regulating the overall size of your list, and if it gets too long, it will eventually become unworkable.<br><br><br>A long list can make Final Version unworkable also, but for different reasons.   I think FV can handle a longer list of tasks before it becomes unworkable.</div>

<div class="content">I use FV in a notebook.<br><br>Variant 1; ’ Excercise;    Fri  Thu  Wed  Tue  Mon’ for daily items and  ’Plan xyz;   Fri  Thu  Wed  Tue  Mon’ for items I want to work with daily. On something similar.<br><br>When I have done some planning I draw a line on that day, and if I do some planning more on the same day I draw another line to form X and then possibly a third to form *. I do not rewrite these items to the end of the list after I have touched on those items, in other words I break the FV rules. I want to see a bigger picture about what happens. I rewrite those items for the next week if still needed to have them. In that way the repetitive tasks are clustered and it’s easier to notice non-repetitive items.<br><br>Variant 2; If I don’t want to work with items daily, I draw a big circle on the spot where a dot will be.  Just to draw attention to the item and to make sure an important (deadlined) item will not get lost in the middle of everything else. <br><br>Variant 3; With some items I count the number of times I have touched them. In other words ’Plan opq 4’ will be ’Plan opq 5’ when rewritten to the end. Usually this is used with Variant 2. If <br>the number stays small there will be problems on the road.<br><br>All these variants have emerged from the need to follow up what happens and to make sure that what should happen also could happen. Variant 1 has stabilized, the others not. <br><br>These variants are part of a bigger problem. If I want to see what I have done during a day, a week, a month how will find that information?  How well is what I have done aligned with my goals?<br><br>A partial solution is above and another partial solution related to a days/week is in ’family lists’ in the post <a href="../fvp_forum/Work-home split in FV.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/fv-forum/post/1909784</a>  .</div>
