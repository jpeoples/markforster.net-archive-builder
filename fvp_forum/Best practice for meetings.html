<div class="content">On another thread, I was complaining about having too many meetings.<br><br>Mark Forster offered some great advice:<br><br><<I learnt this one through observing one of my colleagues:<br><br>When you arrive at a meeting tell the Chair that you have to leave early (preferably after not more than 30 minutes) because of an important appointment (genuine or fictitious).<br><br>He or she will then not only excuse you but will often re-arrange the agenda so that any parts which affect you are done first.<br><br>When I tried it myself, it worked like a dream! >><br><br><br>I thought this was worth it's own thread, so I am starting it here.</div>
