<div class="content">Perhaps this has been asked and answered before, but what should one do with tasks that have been dotted but left undone at, for example, the end of the day or when moving from your "work" list to your "home" list?   Should you:<br><br>1.  Leave them where they are but undotted and redo your scanning from the start?<br>2.  Leave them where they are - dotted  - and resume scanning from the last of them?<br>3.  Cross them off and re-enter them at the end of the list and scan anew?</div>

<div class="content">The answer depends on whether you are using FV or FVP.<br><br>If you are using FV and the dots are no longer relevant, then use #1. If the dots are still relevant then use #2.<br><br>If you are using FVP, use #2. If any of the dotted tasks are no longer relevant use #3 on them (only).</div>
