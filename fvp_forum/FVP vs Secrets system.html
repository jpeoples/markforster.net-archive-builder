<div class="content">Mark,<br>I posted this in a comment on your initial FVP thread (the one announcing it was coming), but I'm afraid the sidebar notification of it got buried in comments on the new system description that came shortly after. I am very interested to hear your thoughts on this:<br><br><<Mark,<br>What interests me more than the new system itself (though I am patiently curious about that) is how your thoughts have changed since you were expressing these kind of ideas:<br><br>"What I have been doing is testing out various systems (including SMEMA) which don't use a continuing to do list or someday/maybe list. They've all proved sufficiently effective for me to doubt the necessity or even the desirability of the said lists."<br><br>You said that in regards to SMEMA and the system described in your new book. Do you still agree with this, and if so, why is the new system better?>></div>

<div class="content">As interesting as the new system is, I can't help but feel a bit disappointed that you have effectively declared the Secrets system obsolete before we even got to read about it. Or am I misunderstanding and FVP does, in fact, operate on similar principles despite the long list?</div>

<div class="content">Mark<br><br>I was very interested in what your reply to Austin would be, however I can't seem to find it in the comments section. <br><br>Would you mind repeating yourself or linking to your reply?<br><br>Thanks<br><br>Btw really enjoying FVP!</div>

<div class="content">I found a comment where you told someone that FVP works on very different principles than Secrets, but I can't find a discussion of why and how your thoughts have changed about long lists. I am not complaining - you offer a lot of information for free and lots of people are asking you questions about FVP, so it doesn't bother me in the least if you prefer to focus your time on this site to answering those questions. Long term, though - especially after your book comes out - I'm sure others will also be curious how your thoughts have changed since you wrote it.</div>

<div class="content">Strange. I remember writing the reply to your original post and I thought it followed your post more or less immediately, but now I can't find it. <br><br>Anyway what I said was on the lines that it was a good idea to have more than one tool available, The two systems are almost the exact opposite of each other.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Austin and Mark - Can you tell me where and when "Secrets" was mentioned? I'm afraid it's completely passed me by.  I've just come back from a trip and am catching up on all the action.  Thanks for your help.</div>

<div class="content">Margaret,<br>Mark has a book coming out in August called Secrets of Productive People. It includes a new system in it (not FVP) that does not involve a long task list. From what Mark has said, the new system is only a small part of the book's content, but it's there. I hadn't heart a name for it, so I called it "the Secrets system" or Secrets for short. Mark may have a more official name.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Austin.  I knew about Mark's forthcoming book, but had forgotten the title.</div>
