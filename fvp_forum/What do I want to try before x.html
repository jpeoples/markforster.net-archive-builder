<div class="content">I want to give this question a try (heh).  It seems to go against the advice of modern productivity thinking, but my spiritual and philosophical tradition (Catholic) has always advised to focus not on the results but on the effort of doing.<br><br>"In the name of God, the soldiers will fight, and God will give the victory!" St. Joan of Arc<br><br>"God has not called me to be successful; He has called me to be faithful." Mother Teresa of Calcutta (falsely attributed, but still theologically sound)<br><br>"You make me think of a little child that is learning to stand but does not yet know how to walk. In his desire to reach the top of the stairs to find his mother, he lifts his little foot to climb the first stair. It is all in vain, and at each renewed effort he falls. Well, be this little child: through the practice of all the virtues, always lift your little foot to mount the staircase of holiness, but do not imagine that you will be able to go up even the first step! No, but the good God does not demand more from you than good will. From the top of the stairs, He looks at you with love. Soon, won over by your useless efforts, He will come down Himself and, taking you in His arms, He will carry you up... But if you stop lifting your little foot, He will leave you a long time on the ground."  St. Therese of Lisieux<br><br>"...and on earth peace to men of good will." Luke 2:14<br><br>It is a form of keeping oneself in the present moment, because you do not care about the future, of whether you will be successful or not, nor do you care about the past, of your judging your possible success by your past experiences, but rather you care about being careful of your work.  And it is supposed to remove frustration and anxiety because your success does not depend on whether the result is favorable or not, but depends on the trying itself.  If you have tried, you have succeeded.  Hence the use of the word "try" instead of "do", because there is the connotation of "failure in doing" and "success in doing" as success or failure of getting the results you want, while the connotation of "failure to try" and "success in trying" is whether you even tried in the first place.</div>
