<div class="content">I was inspired by a recent post on incremental timeboxing and I've been using it over the past month with great effect.  To help myself along, I created a PC application that takes an ordinary todo list and converts it into an incremental timebox list complete with progress bars and tones to let me know when to go to the next task.  It's free and I'd like to share it- here's the link:  <a href="http://ericjorgensen.com/TimeBoxer.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://ericjorgensen.com/TimeBoxer.html</a><br><br>Please try it out and let me know how you like it, or better yet, let me know how I can improve it.</div>

<div class="content">Very nice Eric! I do not do much work at my computer but when I do I'll be sure to give this a run and see if there are any suggestions that can be added. Decremental and incremental timeboxing are huge resistance elimination tactics for me and I still use it till today.</div>

<div class="content">Like it.  Can you make it respect steps that are a negative number of minutes.?</div>

<div class="content">I've posted a new version of timeboxer that allows for negative and partial increments:  <a href="http://ericjorgensen.com/TimeBoxer.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://ericjorgensen.com/TimeBoxer.html</a><br><br>Enjoy!</div>
