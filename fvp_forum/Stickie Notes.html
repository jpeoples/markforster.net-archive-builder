<div class="content">The same good point has been brought up in two threads: Evernote and Phrasing.<br><br>Sometimes we need more detail. A few words is enough to help us decide whether we want to do it before X, but when it comes time to do it, we need more, like when we did it last or a link to an image or the phone number we found last time we worked on that task. It's a pain to copy that information each time we rewrite the task, but it's not worth a separate page or folder.<br><br>Enter: The Sticky Note Experiment<br><br>If a task needs just a few more details, I'm going to use a stickie note. When I rewrite the task, the note moves to the new page. When I no longer need the details, it gets tossed, or saved elsewhere.<br><br>So far I have one with a diary of almost-daily tasks. It says I did voice twice this week and yes I did remember my vitamins today. Another has the phone number and hours of the tailor a friend recommended. (I just know that task will take several sessions -- the pants need washing and packaging and transporting.)<br><br>It will take some time to get a feel for which details belong on the stickies and which belong elsewhere, but so far it's working well.</div>

<div class="content">Stickie notes attached to tasks?<br><br>Such "long notes" is the reason why I'm staying digital, and ensuring my to do list app have "long notes" for each task and preferably "hyperlink" too. EN Windows have both. And no fear of stickie notes falling out. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">cricket - I've tried that and my only suggestion is to 'park' the stickie notes on a separate page in the notebook and maybe mark the task with a star or something if you need a reminder about having a stickie note. I found having the stickies on the same page as the tasks created visual clutter that I found more distracting than helpful.</div>

<div class="content">In my manual system, I write dated notes in the back of the notebook and the list in the front. works reasonably well.</div>

<div class="content">Hmmm, lots of good stuff here for a person who writes phone numbers inside his tasks and sometimes wishes he could write a lot more but is steadfastly a pen & paper guy.<br><br>Will's idea promises to create "one notebook" Nirvana with notes from the back cover inward, and tasks from the front cover onward; when they meet, you have one date-bounded unit of information.<br><br>The stickies idea is nice for not having to flip pages. Nothing pops out like a phone number, right there, waiting to be dialed. If it's a page flip away, less pop.<br><br>Since I only deposit ink on one side of my notebook pages, the facing side is available for related stickies, solving Lillian's problem.<br><br>I wonder whether I should do something with this ... I know, I'll add to my list:<br>(GET) stickies<br><br>No, wait ...<br>(GET) stickies used ... uhh ... for related notes ...<br><br>Hmmm<br>(GET) stickies with notes on facing pages ...<br><br>Aw, heck<br>stickies idea (Cricket)</div>

<div class="content">I'm currently not keeping details such as a sticky might hold. But when I did, it was with postit tabs. They were arranged alphabetically down the side of my notebook, with the subject, aka the task name, written on the tab. So a task "P groceries" would turn me to the grocery page, marked by a removable tab.</div>

<div class="content">If I were to write a task that was "continued" on another page, I'd end the task with "..." (rather like the way Mark uses a ? to flag some tasks).<br><br>An interesting tip I picked up from someone was to put the post-its on the page with the sticky side facing south (ie, underneath the written note) rather than north (ie, above the written note). With the sticky side at the bottom of the note, the post-it sort of bows upward off the page and toward you so it gets your attention a little easier.</div>

A colleague of mine had the annoying habit of doing just that, and one day my frustration turned to emulation.<br><br>But get *this* - nowadays, I most often place the sticky strip to the *left*! When you are writing on the right-facing page of a notebook, or placing a loose page on the desk to your right, the note pops up toward you at a natural angle.</div>

<div class="content">If you put the stickie strip towards the spine of the book, the book opens and closes without disturbing the note, but it just feels wrong to me to have the unstickie part on the left. Don't know why, but it does, and the list is to be a comfortable home rather than something we avoid.</div>
