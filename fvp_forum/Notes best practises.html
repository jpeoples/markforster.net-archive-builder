<div class="content">So all the notes are new/updated reference info? If they're coming in electronically, I'd dump them into a folder "Ref Info To Update" and add a task to FV "clear out Ref Info folder"</div>

<div class="content">sure - it's the same idea. Put the new reference info items in one place (or two - one for paper and one for electronic) until the FV task of "deal with new reference item" gets dotted. Either way, you need a way to know which items have already been dealt with.</div>

<div class="content">Jupiter:<br><br>The way I do it:<br><br>1. Take note on piece of paper (I don't mix notes into my FV list)<br>2. If immediate action is needed, take it.<br>2a. Even if no immediate action is needed, I follow GTD's 2 minute rule.  If it's contact information, for example, I enter it into my contact database right away.  If some action is needed as a result of the note, I enter the action into the appropriate list/calendar.<br>3. If no immediate action is needed (or you don't have the time to deal with the note right away), place the piece of paper in your Inbox (this is a figurative Inbox.  It could be a separate section of your notebook designated as an Inbox, it could be a place in your messenger back, or a physical Inbox on your desk)<br>4. My FV list has a recurring task titled: "Clear Inbox"  When that task comes up, I review all notes, place actionable items on my FV list, file reference items as needed, enter reminders in tickler system or Waiting For list, delegate tasks if appropriate, and write appointments in my calendar.</div>

<div class="content">Here is how I handle different kinds of notes:<br><br>Paper meeting notes:   Add a task to FV, "Write up meeting notes and send out".   If I see one or two embedded tasks, I will also enter those into FV.  If there are LOTs of tasks, or I need to think through it to see what the tasks are, I'll add to FV: "Tasks from meeting notes".   I am using OneNote, so those are the things I write on the task title, and the entire meeting notes are usually in the task detail, for easy reference.<br><br>Electronic meeting notes:   I keep meeting notes in OneNote most of the time, organized by team or project.   After the meeting, I can usually send out the notes immediately by email.   I then make a copy of the notes page, and enter it into my FV list with the title, "Check for tasks".   Then when prompted by FV, I extract the tasks (or just do them).<br><br>Random notes:  E.g., somebody gives me a business card or my daughter scrawls a note on a sticky and puts it on my desk.   If I can't handle the implicit tasks immediately, I usually scan these right into OneNote with my Fujitsu ScanSnap and put them in my FV list.   When prompted by FV, I can copy the business card info into my contacts list, or deal with my daughter's request, or whatever.</div>

<div class="content">I find it simplest to put simple discrete pieces of information straight into my FV list, e.g.<br><br>Bill's Phone +44 1496 3426<br>Mike recommended La Maison Rouge restaurant<br>Meeting place for Friday: Conference Room<br>Last quarter's turnover £100,000<br><br>I can then treat them as tasks to enter into permanent records and/or investigate further.</div>

<div class="content">I do similar to Mark, except for the phone number example ...<br><br><< Bill's Phone +44 1496 3426 >><br><br>I would likely just key the numbers directly into my SGS2 phone keypad mode and "Add to Contacts". Instead of entering them into my Evernote Android FV list. If the phone numbers are on a signboard with other information, I would likely just use my SGS2 camera to take a snapshot of it. <br><br>I do fall back on a small A7 notebook to capture info snippets that would be too fiddly to enter directly into specific apps on my SGS2. Or would disturb others if I do so. Try using your SGS2 in a cinema, to note some facts/points about the movie. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">@Mark - do you put every notes in your FV list ? Some of mine can be long<br>Ie informations about a building can take 10 lines....<br>Information about a research can take 7 lines</div>

<div class="content">I follow the path of least resistance:<br><br>If I can immediately visualize where to record the info and feel like entering it there, then I do so. Otherwise, I write it into my FV list and transfer it later, when the task receives a dot. A little while ago, it dawned on me that since FV does not care how many tasks I have per page, there is no harm in items that span several lines. I indent subsequent lines below the first. The first needs to be succinct enough to scan with The Question, and you skip the indented lines when scanning.<br><br>For longer items, such as a full page, I sometimes type or paste the info into a temporary text file on my computer. I leave the "Untitled" window open and write a one-liner in FV to put it away someplace. Fortunately, my text editor backs up its temporary files. The last time my machine crashed, I had several of these open, all unsaved, yet they all came back after rebooting, as soon as I relaunched the editor (TextEdit, Mac OS).<br><br>For me, it has helped tremendously to separate the note-taking from the decision of where to record the information. It reduces resistance to capturing ideas and promotes impromptu brainstorming sessions that go on for days, one idea at a time in odd moments, even when I didn't know that a project deserved a brainstorming session. Suddenly, there are dozens of ideas in my list about Project X, stimulating demand for their own file, and so the ideas get dotted into one giant chain and stored away.<br><br>It is much better than trying to make brainstorming into a discrete event. Cue Winnie the Pooh, tapping his brow: "Think, think, think!"</div>

<div class="content">Like Bernie I separate note-taking from filing. At home, short temporary notes go on yellow stickies. Sometimes short permanent notes go on them, too -- the pad is handy -- and then get copied to permanent form later. Permanent notes either go in my purse notebook or a new sheet of paper, depending on the project. If I only work on it at home I'm more likely to use a separate sheet. If I'll want it when traveling, it goes in the purse notebook.<br><br>When I used paper for FV, I was like Bernie -- no reason not to put short temporary notes there. If I expected to want to file it later, I'd start a new page which could be torn out and filed later. If I forgot, I photocopied the note and filed that (and marked the original note "copy in correct file".<br><br>Now, notes that don't have a better home go in EverNote. (Letters from the phone company about our account still go in the phone company file.) I tried using my mobile to take notes, but the keyboard is too slow.<br><br>On the road, it all goes into the notebook in my purse -- notes, reminders, meeting minutes, anything. When a page changes from "action items" to "reference", I tear one corner. I usually leave notes in the book for several months. It's nice to refer to notes from previous meetings. Eventually, all the pages get torn out and tossed or filed. If one sheet has notes that should go in two different places, I either copy or photo-copy. (I even mark the original "other topic copied and filed", so if I see it again I won't panic.<br><br>This method creates a bit of a filing backlog -- there's a burst when I fill a book -- but that's better than having to get the right file every time I have a note. It's a bit faster now that I can take a picture with my mobile and put the picture in EverNote.<br><br>Exception -- if I already have the calendar out (to schedule dinner), I'll take most of the notes on the calendar (bring dessert). If the space is too full, I write the rest at the bottom of the page or on the blank pages at the end, and cross-reference both ways. If it's more complicated (I was voluntold to co-ordinate who brings what), I'll use my purse notebook.<br><br>I also like to have my notes close to where I'll use them. Stickies by the computer for phone numbers I'll need in the next few days, or write them with the task -- but I keep the stickie around until the number is in my permanent address book.</div>

<div class="content"><< I tried using my mobile to take notes, but the keyboard is too slow. >><br><br>Cricket, I forget whether you're on iOS or Android. If the latter, did you try using SWYPE? I find my swyping speed is about 80% of my touch typing speed (50wpm), and quite acceptable for substantial notetaking on my SGS2.<br><br>Oh, I love taking "note" with my mobile camera. Just snap and done. Lately, I combine that with sharing via Instagram. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Sabre23t, I have an iPod touch and a Playbook. I tried SWYPE on the iPod and hated it. Even when it correctly identified the letters, it only suggested a few words -- usually not the right ones. I haven't tried it with the Playbook, but find the Playbook's auto-suggest is surprisingly good (except for the- words -- there are too many of them.)<br><br>I agree, note-taking with a camera is awesome. I see posters all the time. Take picture, email it to Evernote, and done.<br><br>My task list is now on an Excel spreadsheet. I can sort it by date-next-can-be-done, date-last-done, stars, tags, task, or any other field I want. I record date-last-done, and have a small note field. If it needs longer notes, I find Evernote works well. Some projects already have a working paper system -- in which case, if it ain't broke,...</div>
