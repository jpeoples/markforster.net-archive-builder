<div class="content">If I have 15 minutes before a scheduled activity and I've just completed an FV chain, should I...<br><br>1) Make another chain, even though I know most of it will be left until my next block of discretionary time, and it may or may not still feel relevant then.<br><br>2) Don't make another chain. Just do whatever I feel like doing, and when I find myself at the beginning of another large block of discretionary time, build a new chain then.</div>

<div class="content">or<br><br>3) Try to make a 15 minute or less chain.<br><br>Yes, this is sort of a follow-up on a question I asked quite a while ago, but this aspect of the question I'm still not sure about.</div>

<div class="content">Do the first task on the list (or make a start on it). A chain of one.</div>

<div class="content"><<You need to build a new chain !>><br><br>liner,<br><br>Thank you for offering feedback on my question. Would you be willing to explain why you would advise this rather than what Mark advised? I also do not know whether you mean I should build a chain that can be completed in 15 minutes or one that will carry over beyond the upcoming event.<br><br>Regards,</div>

<div class="content">Austin, I think all your options can be thought of as making a new chain, for that last 15min discretionary time ...<br><br>Chain of 0 - do anything else out of FV purview (your #2)<br>Chain of 1 - do first FV task (as MF suggested)<br>Chain of 2 - do another FV task then the first (may be what liner intended)<br>Chain of X - do normal FV chain, usually 3 or more (your #1)</div>

<div class="content">My vote is use Colley's rule with the question: "Is this the best use of the time I have?"<br><br>A chain of one would be the root task, which might not be the best use of that time. The root task might have a large set-up time, or be likely to grow unpredictably (checking email).<br><br>The best use of that time might be:<br><br>- prepare for the meeting physically (shoes, bathroom, snack, check you have everything) or mentally (review agenda and previous notes).<br><br>- arrive early and chat with other attendees, or breathe for a few minutes.<br><br>- do (part of) day-end routine so you can go home immediately after the meeting.<br><br>- run a quick errand on the way.<br><br>- little and often bit of another project (one that won't grow past the time you have, or hold your mind once the time is up).</div>
