<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lca1x_ulS58&feature=youtu.be" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lca1x_ulS58&feature=youtu.be</a><br><br>Mark asked, so I delivered. Here's a rough idea of how I use Evernote and FV. A few items I didn't cover in the video: <br><br>* completed/finished tasks/projects are moved to a notebook entitled "completed"<br>* during my weekly review, I will tag certain notes with a project tag i.e. "website"<br>* because Evernote is my 1-stop shop for email, clippings, projects, scanned items, etc., my default notebook "inbox", becomes my FV list. Simple, stress-free... <br><br>Feel free to ask any questions or offer suggestions.</div>

<div class="content">Best viewed in "Full Screen" mode.<br><br>For some reason, the image is blurry (for me anyway) as the video is loading. If you let the video load for a few seconds, than click on the scroll bar to an earlier point in time, the image becomes much clearer.</div>

<div class="content">avrum:<br><br>Thanks for producing this. It's basically the way I envisaged one might do it in Evernote. One way to make it a bit faster would be to highlight the tasks as you select them (using Ctrl-click), Then drag them all in one go into the DO tag in the left panel.<br><br>Another even faster way would be to use the tick box. Put a tick box in the body of each task with a tick when you write it, and untick the ones you have selected. When you've worked on a task either delete it or tick it again as appropriate. You can display either all tasks with a tick box or just those with the tick box unticked.</div>

<div class="content">Avrum: how long will this clip be available?<br><br>I working in Uganda till the end of the month and we have slowish Internet (partly because last month, a ship dragged its anchor in Mombasa harbour and damaged the undersea cable feed for the region) and currently there is a power outage!<br><br>I have become a convert to Evernote ( I never really go going with OneNote) partly because of the Forum.  I am using it more and more with my smartphone synchronised with my Toshiba notebook via the Evernote website.  <br><br>My current application for FV is a combination of Toodledo and Android Ultimate To Do List, however the latter is not synchronising with Toodledo.  I also find that I'm liable to try and apply to many variables eg Contexts, Locations, Priorities etc (I think the last is somewhat counterproductive).<br><br>If I can get a good connection, I'll view the clip and/or try Evernote for FV.<br><br>Mark: I think I favour the first of your two options mentioned.<br><br>PS: just tried the clip, no luck, will follow comments here till end of month.</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br><<One way to make it a bit faster....>><br><br>Fantastic! I was looking for a way to preselect w/o having the tasks rearrange themselves as quickly as they do due to 'sort by..." field.<br><br>I would love to produce another screencast highlighting the benefits of FV & Evernote,and post it on the Evernote forum (and a few other Evernote blogs) that I visit. However people are going to want the rules, etc. So, do I have permission to spread the good word?</div>

<div class="content">Rojer J<br><br><<Avrum: how long will this clip be available?>><br><br>So long as YouTube doesn't close shop, the video will be there ;) However I have plans to produce a better looking version in the near future.</div>

<div class="content">avrum:<br><br><< However people are going to want the rules, etc. So, do I have permission to spread the good word?  >><br><br>My concern is that people who have the rules should be signed up on the newsletter. Giving people the rules on the Evernote blog doesn't achieve that. So I'm afraid the answer is no.</div>

<div class="content">No problem. Let me know when you'd like to spread the word via the Evernote channels.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the great presentation Avrum. I use Evernote as a general repository for all my reference material but manage my FV list in another app.<br><br>Having it all working out of Evernote with appropriate links to stored material or simply converting incoming material into tasks makes it extremely convenient. Your screencast was an excellent primer on how to implement it. Looking forward to your next production!<br><br>And thank you Mark for a such a flexible yet powerful system. I am really enjoying putting my tasks through the paces in FV.</div>

<div class="content">JD - thanks!<br><br>Mark - I've created a new tutorial (currently being uploaded to YouTube), demonstrating how to highlight tasks by using using Ctrl-click (Windows) or Cmd-click (Mac). As well, the new screencast should look much better than the original. <br><br>I'm going to create a new thread with a link to the new screencast. Or you can merge these threads. Whatever you think would work best.</div>

<div class="content">avrum:<br><br>What I will do though is mention (or perhaps even major on) your application in the next issue of my FV Newsletter. That might get a few more fans for Evernote itself!</div>

<div class="content">avrum & Mark,<br><<That might get a few more fans for Evernote itself!>><br><br>You may just convert me to Evernote. I used to enjoy a Mac app called Journlr, which went out of business. Evernote looks like a similar idea but better.<br><br>avrum,<br>Have you ever used Notational Velocity? At one point, I was looking at it and Evernote, but at the time, neither one tipped the scale for me.</div>
