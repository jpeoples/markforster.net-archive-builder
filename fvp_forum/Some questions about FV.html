<div class="content">I'm working on a little software project. I have a document planning the next feature out. How can I work with FV to productively work through the plan? Do I put "Work on feature X" in the list, and treat the feature/project plan as a single item as far as the list is concerned? Notice the feature project plan lists things with various dependencies. For instance, the model must be built before everything else. Should I just start picking things from the project/feature plan and drop them into the list depending on order of dependency and urgency?<br><br>Also, I have a bunch of stuff on my list that are nuances of existing features that can certainly wait. If I take the instructions and put a dot beside the first actionable item I'm going to be wasting time. The item needs to be done, but working on getting the big things in place is almost always the way you want to build software. <br><br>So right off the bat I'm having a hard time seeing how I can apply this to my work life. Can anyone make suggestions to help me out. Should I just move all of the minor features off the list and make a "soon" list or something similar. That seems the most reasonable thing to do. Also, should I just keep my list tight and relevant to the items that are pressing and just leave the less pressing ones off the list, or put them on a "soon" list?<br><br>I guess the main mind block I'm having is the idea of having to select the first actionable item. I might prefer to work on, say, watching instructional videos later in the day when I'm tired and not much good for anything else. If I have to put a dot beside that in the morning it's going to bring up a fair bit of friction for me. But it still needs to be done, just later when I have no energy to do anything else. Sorry, a lot of my concerns may already have been discussed. Feel free to direct me to other posts if they're relevant. Thanx.</div>

<div class="content">Steve:<br><br>Thanks for your question. With a situation like this it's usually a case of finding what works best. Since everyone's situation is different, there's no one set of rules that can cover every eventuality.<br><br>Having said the above, in the situation you describe I would probably restrict the items on the list to those I feel should be done now. If you do a task and think "That was a waste of time when I've got so many more important things on my plate", then that task probably shouldn't have been on the list.<br><br>It's important to remember that you don't have to finish any task. You can just do a bit of work on it and then re-enter it. So in the example you give of having to "Watch Instructional Videos", you work on it could consist of just selecting a couple of videos to watch later in the day at a scheduled time.<br><br>Remember too that you can enter a project at any level. So you can put "Project X" as a task or "Call Bob about Project X" or both. If you put "Project X" you would probably want to use a project list from which you can select tasks in any order you like.</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br>Thanx for the thoughtful reply. I pruned down my work list to things that I need to do and have a project lists, and I also find a list for learning makes sense in my case. Anyhow, I guess experimentation to see what works best is the key.</div>

<div class="content">That"-'s remind me a book from Michael LINENBERGER Master your work day now. Very interesting and he uses 2 lists one for NOW (divided in 2 : critical now, opportunity now) and one over the horizon. Lots and lots about AF in that. I like it very much.</div>
