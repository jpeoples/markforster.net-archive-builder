<div class="content">Hello all. I am a newcomer to the blog and am fascinated by FV.<br><br>May I ask- what about items that never seem to get actioned, but just clutter the list, but which could be important later?<br><br>Is there a rule for removing items which are not actioned safely?</div>

<div class="content">At a certain point all items get actioned, i.e. at least when they are the oldest task on the list.<br><br>If you don't want to action these, put them in a Someday / Tickler list for later review, so that they don't bother you while working on active tasks.</div>

<div class="content">Robyn:<br><br>Will you be using paper, a mobile device, or a computer to keep your list?</div>

<div class="content">As Stefano said, I also have (a.o.) two more lists for such tasks: someday list (grouped by projects/areas) which I review as I feel to (different projects differently) and tickler list = tasks with dates when I want to see them (start doing them/review them) - which usually means to move them to FV list. Currently I use Omnifocus for these lists and paper for Final Version. But these lists can be implemented both electronically or on paper. It is not necessary to have one system for all of them...</div>
