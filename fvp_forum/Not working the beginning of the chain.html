<div class="content">So, today's my first day with FV and it looks like the beginning of the chain might never get worked on...<br><br>I started with a list of 15 items. #1, #3, #4, and #12 are dotted. I finish 12 and 4. I get a phone call and then have dinner. I start going through the list again, and have #1, #3, and #8 dotted. Depending how long #8 takes, I might get through 8 and some of 3 tonight. #1 doesn't get touched. Tomorrow, I'll start again, and have #1, and a few other dots. I work on the other dots and maybe #1 again doesn't get touched.<br><br>Am I missing a step here?<br><br>I'm just wondering how FV will handle my work to-do's where "drop everything and do this now" stuff tends to pop up all day. I can easily see the early morning dots don't get touched but all the new "do now!" items do. Maybe that ok from a work-urgency perspective outside of FV, but is it 'breaking' FV somehow?</div>

<div class="content">Simple:   After dinner, I would have started where I left off instead going through the list again and adding 8.</div>

<div class="content">I think the Little and Often principle would be one solution.</div>

<div class="content">UnaV:<br><br>Basically the answer is, as Paul suggests, as far as possible to keep going with the existing chain and not add anything to it unless you really have to. <br><br>I don't know what the "drop everything and do this now" stuff consists of but the way to handle it is to ask yourself "Does this really have to be done now this instant?"<br><br>1) If the answer is "No" then add it to the list and don't dot it. Pick  it up on the next full scan.<br><br>2) If the answer is "Yes" then just do it. Don't put it on the list at all. Use the list only for working in the intervals between the immediate tasks. This would be similar to someone working in a shop who gets on with the paperwork and administrative tasks in the intervals between serving customers.</div>

<div class="content">Mark, I think the question more accurately  is "does my *boss* say it has to be right now?"  The answer's yes often enough that it's something I have to deal with regularly.</div>

<div class="content">In addition to all of the above:<br><br>Last resort, work for 5 minutes on each item to finish a languishing chain. Often, this will break the inertia, and assuming you do not complete the items, they will be at the bottom of the list where they can be little-and-often'd to death over the next few days. Worst case, they go stale again until reaching the top of the list, and you'll try again.<br><br>On time-pressured days, I would try and create smaller chains, and keep in mind the length of your chain when deciding how long to work on each item. Longer chain, shorter bursts. Hopefully this becomes natural over time. I'm still tending to work too long on things, but I've survived by finishing chains on day two.</div>

<div class="content">I used to my boss my todo list (usually a shorter version prepared for the purpose) and asked him what he wants done first. Only have to do it once or twice before they realize they I can't do everything immediately.<br><br>When possible, don't rebuild the chain, or any part of it, after a break, even overnight. Keep working the existing chain all the way back to the first task.<br><br>I find that when the pre-selected list is hard to finish, it's because I slipped back to the question I've used for years: What do I want to do today? I'm looking at one of those right now, and you'll notice I'm here rather than working the list. (Heads off to pre-select a better chain.)</div>

<div class="content">Thanks to this thread, I just finished another chain! There were two items to go, both high-resistance, left over from yesterday, and I was on the verge of rationalizing adding more "urgent" things beneath them, which would have been the third delay for this chain.<br><br>Instead, I remembered my own advice (above) to finish the chain by putting 5 minutes into each item. I ended up putting ten minutes into each. The first has now dissolved into a handful of manageable sub-items at the end of the list; each requires some thought and a decision but none are especially difficult, and I ended up completing one immediately after writing it. The second has turned into a possible family project for next week's Spring Break.<br><br>Twenty minutes, two more resistive items actioned, another old page crossed off, another new chain to come!<br><br>I agree with Mark: the best part of this system is dotting up a fresh, new chain. It is *much* more satisfying than re-extending an old one. I hope I remember that next time.</div>

<div class="content">Mark - usually my boss is good about "do this new thing FIRST, then go back to what's in progress" Or vice versa. But once in a while, depending where in the project life-cycle we are, well, it's seems like EVERYTHING is "do this FIRST" so what was "first" 1/2 hour ago is now 2nd. Yes, it's annoying, if for no reason other than the constant 'shifting mental gears' and the hesitation about starting anything because a "do this FIRST" might pop.<br><br>Cricket - ok, no rebuilding chains. I think I missed that in the instructions, but it does makes sense.<br><br>Bernie - congrats on finishing your chain :)</div>
