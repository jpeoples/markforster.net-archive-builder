<div class="content">I have tried migrating to FV with Focus Pad (iPhone App originally released for Auto Focus in 2009) with great success.<br><br>There is a simple list in which you can colour the tasks blue (as an equivalent to the dotted tasks), red (which I use to indicate the current taks - so I can easily  find what I am currentrly working on) grey for abandoned.<br><br>Items can also be maked as done, marked as done and automatically re-entered at the end of the list or scheduled for some future date.<br><br>Completed pages can be arcihived and you can access curent pages, archived pages or all pages.<br><br>The whole thing syncs to focuspad.ws so apart from #tags is just about perfect and available anywhere.<br><br>Woth a look if you want a simple electronic version.</div>

<div class="content">Tony,<br><br>Does linking it to my Google account have a benefit? I try to keep my accounts separate. Google and Yahoo and the like have a habit of "helpfully" sharing information. I don't want my professional friends to see my private todo list, or email addresses that I store in the private todo list to be invited to friend me.</div>

<div class="content">I reinstalled FocusPad yesterday...hadn't used since AF. It works great. Google linking backs up your data and syncs between devices. I have an iPhone and iPad. They work flawlessly with it. Really good app...</div>

<div class="content">Cricket, I am using Google's App Engine to host the back-end sync services. That is why I use a Google login. I figured most people would like this, since they already have a Google account.<br><br>Fortunately all of your data is stored in a section of their database exclusively used by the app, and Google does not go poke around in there. So you won't run into the same kind of privacy issues that Google+ users experience.</div>

<div class="content">Hi all.<br><br>I just submitted an update to FocusPad, to be more iOS 5 friendly. It now properly multi-tasks, and it includes high-resolution graphics for retina displays. There are also a few minor bug fixes.<br><br>I have been using the app with Final Version, and I am very happy with the process. I have been amazed how many long-outstanding tasks I am getting done. My thanks to Mark for making FocusPad more relevant again :-)<br><br>..tony..</div>

<div class="content">I used FocusPad on my Ipod Touch and liked it, but migrated to Android.  Any chance of an  Android version of FocusPad?</div>

<div class="content">Jeff, sorry, no Android plans at the moment. But if that changes I will let you know.</div>

<div class="content">I would like to do an Android version. I will keep this in mind for the next FocusPad update, but I don't have a timeline yet.</div>

<div class="content">Tony,<br><br>I really like FP.  I have been using the colors instead of dots so far. Questions:<br><br>Are there any updates coming up to make it more FV friendly? .<br>Is it possible to have FP filter out the selected chain when ready to work on it?<br>Is it possible to have the 'x' task show up on each  page in order to generate the chain easier? <br><br>Thanks.</div>

<div class="content">A long-standing request has been to filter by color. This would then show the chain. So I will highly consider this.<br><br>In order to show the 'x' task on each page, I can imagine a feature that would show the most recently changed task. This would naturally show the "x" task since it would have just been highlighted. I need to think about this one a little more.</div>

<div class="content">After trying various apps  I still find Focuspad the best iPhone app for FV functionally so I look forward very much to the proposed changes :).  <br> I do understand the interest in Clear as it is a beautiful interface and very "tactile" but the focus pad functions are really  more rounded and good for working with tickler and project files etc<br>So 'beautify'  the user interface and add the suggested filters and I think we'll have a perfect FV app<br>Approximately When might we expect to see this next version do you think?</div>

<div class="content">Has anyone gotten a sync error on the FP webpage?  I just started using it (on iPhone and Mac/Safari), and am getting an "OverQuotaError: The API call datastore_v3.RunQuery() required more quota than is available."<br><br>Do I need to delete a page?</div>

<div class="content">My sync error over the weekend resolved itself somehow.  But now I'm having a new issue – using Firefox on an older Mac, I entered a few tasks and got double entries. When there was only one line left on the last page, it changed the page length from 7 to 8 lines! Now the web interface is screwed up on my last page, so there is no longer correspondence to the iPhone pages. I really wanted to like FP, but the lack of support and clunkiness/slowness of the web interface is causing me to abandon it for now. Back to Clear.<br><br>This experience is reminding me of something similar I went through with Things for Mac and iPhone a couple of years ago. The idea that everything would stay synced between devices was very attractive. But it got complex and cumbersome to maintain. Certain features didn't translate smoothly between the two apps. Spent a lot of money and time, and then abandoned these tools. Sigh.</div>

<div class="content">ubi,<br><br>I feel bad getting back to you after so many months, but I missed your post somehow. If you are interested in using FocusPad again, please email me and I will try and help solve the issue you are having.</div>
