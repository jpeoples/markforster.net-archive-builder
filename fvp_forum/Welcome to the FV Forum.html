<div class="content">Welcome to the FV Forum. The purpose of the forum is to answer questions and discuss issues relating to the Final Version time management system. If you do not have the instructions for the Final Version, you can obtain them by subscribing to my email newsletter in the right margin.<br><br>For all other topics, including previous time management systems of mine, please use the General Forum.</div>

<div class="content">Been more than a day subscribed to the new list and still no instructions...  Am I just being impatient or could something be amiss?</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br>No, something is definitely amiss if it's been longer than a day. I'll look into it for you and get back to you directly.</div>

<div class="content">You are shown as correctly subscribed, so the newsletter would definitely have been sent out to you.<br><br>You might check your spam settings, etc, to make sure it's not getting filtered out somewhere.<br><br>In the meantime I've sent you another copy via a different route. Let me know if you don't receive it.</div>

<div class="content">I received the copy sent by separate route. I have been reviewing my spam folder and have noticed nothing yet.  I will write here if time goes by and I still receive nothing, but I am well aware of the difficulty involved in troubleshooting email issues...<br><br>Thanks for taking the time to get a copy to me regardless.<br><br>Mark L. :)</div>
