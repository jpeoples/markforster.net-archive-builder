<div class="content">I really like the theory behind FV, however I've not used any of Mark's other systems before.  Is this just based on one long list, or should I set up my list based on one of his other systems?  <br><br>So to start ... do I just make one long honking list of all the stuff and projects I have on the go, or is there something different I should do to start?  <br><br>Any links to what he has written before where I should start?<br><br>Thanks everyone!</div>

<div class="content">Start small.  List anything you think of now, and start working that list. As you work, other things will come to mind.  Add those at the end.</div>

<div class="content">Strathy:<br><br>It's good to keep giving the instructions a regular re-read because you will find things you overlooked the first time. There is for instance some guidance on how to start:<br><br>"The best way to sink any time management system is to overload it right at the beginning. FV is pretty resilient, but at this stage you aren't. So build up the list gradually. My advice is to start off with the tasks and projects that are of immediate concern to you right now, and then add more as they come up in the natural course of things.<br><br>"Tasks can be added at any level, e.g. Project X, Plan Restructuring, Call Pete, Tidy Desk."</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Mark and Alan.  I will start with just one list then ... beginning with what is on my immediate plate and slowly add other items as they come at me.  Thanks!</div>
