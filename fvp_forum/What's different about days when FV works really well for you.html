<div class="content">For me, strangely, its when I allow myself to drift toward AF mode if the day has a gentle pace.<br><br>I take moments to get peaceful and ask "What timing will give me the best results?"</div>

<div class="content">FV works best for me when the day has less stress.  I don't understand your answer at all.  FV works best for you when you do AF instead of FV?  What's timing got to do with the system working?</div>

<div class="content">When FV works really well for me, whats different is when I feel relaxed. All urgent things have been handled enough so I could make progress on my important things. Also, FV works really well when the answer to the Question is easy to answer. <br><br>The bad days: Sometimes I second guess what I want to do before x and sometimes I look too deeply/overthink into answering the question 'correctly'.   <br><br>@Alan Baljieu<br>-I believe Michael means FV works best for him when priorities are not longer a big issue so as to ask the Question. Hence, he drifts towards the AF method, in whatever feels ready to be done. <br>-Also, timing doesn't really have anything to do with FV working. But it does play a big part of what you want to get done 'today'. So, thats probably why he's asking "What timing will give me the best results?" That's understandable especially if there are interruptions/meetings/commitments through out the day.</div>

<div class="content">I think I need an explicit answer.  What precisely is Michael doing on good days?</div>

<div class="content">@Alan On good days I let myself do a pre-select chain but am happy to use the whole list in AF-mode; FV mode works best for me either when the quantity of things to be done increases or I'm feeling on a roll, or a wave of energetic enthusiasm. I move between modes. I also allow myself to use FV 2 ways: What would i LIKE to do before X? and What SHOULD I do before X? That way my playful side and my duty-bound side get a voice.</div>

<div class="content">Hrm.  Would doing this on "bad" days make those better?</div>

<div class="content">Another variation on the question: What makes sense to do before X?<br><br>That question includes things best done in sequence (laundry in machine before washing breakfast dishes -- so can hang it up early so it's dry by evening). It also includes deadlines, appointments, energy levels, whatever else needs to be considered.</div>

<div class="content">"Angle of approach" gives rise to the different questions?<br><br>What would I like to do before X? - angle=giving to myself<br>What must I do before X? - angle=duty and obligation<br>What makes sense to do before X? - angle=practical<br>What stands out? - angle = intuitive<br>What is my higher purpose today? - angle=spiritual<br><br><br><br>Wisdom is knowing what to do next; virtue is doing it.  ~David Star Jordan, The Philosophy of Despair</div>

<div class="content">Perhaps, Michael.  Alternative way of looking at the original thread question: FV works best on the quiet days, but that doesn't mean FV fails on the busy days.  <br><br>No, FV is a tool to help decide what to do next.  On busy days, I already know what to do and FV is surplus.</div>
