<div class="content">Some say that if you do something for 65 days, it will become an established habit.<br><br>I have just signed up on stickk.com, making a 10 weeks commitment to "Correctly use Mark Forster's FVP time management system every day".<br><br>My purpose is to avoid taking shortcuts and having my FVP practice collapse when things get very busy.<br><br>Part of this system is to have someone to serve as a "referee", to add a further incentive to stick to the commitment.  All the referee has to do is receive a weekly report on progress.  Although the referee does need to register as a stickk member.<br><br>I figured people here would inderstand what I am trying to do.  Would anyone be willing to be my referee? :-)<br><br>Regards<br>Steve</div>
