<div class="content">Has the FV been mailed out?  I take it from some of the posts that it has.  I didn't update my profile until just now, 2 days after the need to do so was announced. Am I going to receive a copy or did I miss it?</div>

<div class="content">Based on some other posts it sounds like it gets mailed out every so often. I'll be patient then.</div>

<div class="content">It'll come soon, I'm sure - I had mine within a few hours of signing up. The new system is awesome.</div>

<div class="content">See the blog post: "Final Version Instructions now issued" for the instructions.  In short, sign up for the email newsletter (again) in the right column.</div>

<div class="content">Hello - I signed up for the newsletter several days ago and received welcome but FV instructions have not arrived. When should I expect to receive them? thanks</div>

<div class="content">Mark just had a granddaughter and is out of town.  So it might be a few more days while he spends time with family.</div>
