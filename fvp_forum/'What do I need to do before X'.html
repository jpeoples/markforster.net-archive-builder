<div class="content">Assuming all behaviour is directed towards meeting our needs, wouldn't be the question 'what do I need to do before X' be a really good question to ask ourselves when using the Final Version framework?</div>

<div class="content">Leon, it probably depends on understandings and linguistic connotations of each of us. For me, your question means "what is necessary to do before this task to prepare everything for the task". Which is not the case for FV. Also, I would not like the passivity of the question - I feel big difference between passive "what I need to do" (which I translate like "should do", forbidden word by many therapists :) and active "what I want". But of course, other people can have different understandings...</div>

<div class="content">Mark commented on an earlier thread that you can take the verb out of it altogether and still get most of the sense of the question:  "What to do before X?"</div>

<div class="content">I agree with Daneb that the active connotations of "what do I want" are preferable to the passive connotations of "what do I need".<br><br>I also agree with Seraphim that the "Before" part of the question is the key.<br><br>The genius of the whole question "What do I want to do before I do x?"  is that it subsumes all criteria that may factor into WHY you want to do something before x.<br><br>examples:<br>Given what is important what do I want to do before x?<br>Given what is urgent what do I want to do before x?<br>Given what I'm resisting what do I want to do before x?<br>Given what I'd like to finish now what do I want to do before x?<br><br>In your case you might try:<br>Given my needs what do I want to do before x?<br><br>In all these examples answering the question gives you the precedence for ordered task execution.</div>

<div class="content">leon:<br><br>If you want to experiment, try "What needs to be done before x?". It's less prescriptive than "What do I need to do before x?"</div>
