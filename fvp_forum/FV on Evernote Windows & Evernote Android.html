<div class="content">This is a followup thread to Avrum's "NEW! Screencast: Evernote & FV (better quality, better workflow (courtesy of Mr. Forster)" <a href="../fvp_forum/NEW! Screencast Evernote & FV (better quality, better workflow (courtesy of Mr. Forster).html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/fv-forum/post/1765213</a> thread that have been locked.<br><br>Mark wrote:<br><< Evernote PC Desktop only changes the time in the Updated column if a change is made to the body of the note. Changes to the tags or to the note title don't change it. (My version is 4.5.4.6487 (234804) Public). >><br><br>Looks like with Evernote Windows 4.5.5.6796 (246180) Public that have changed a bit. Adding tags still doesn't effect Updated column, but changing note title now does effect Updated column.<br><br>Another tips for using Evernote Windows to preselect the FV tasks. Move the Sync column just before the Title column. When you add the "Do" tag to the task, it will raise the sync flag/dot. So you can much more easily see the tasks you've tagged/dotted.<br><br>Are there many here still using Evernote Windows for FV? :-)</div>

<div class="content">Sabre23t, yesI'm using Evernote Windows for FV & also Evernote Android; mostly the windows version. I started using it at about he same time as Mark's release of FV because of a mobile phone upgrade. The combination of FV & EN is working extremely well for me.</div>

<div class="content">Like Geoff I am still enjoying EN Windows for FV. <br>I will try your suggestion with the sync column and let you know if it helps.<br><br>Thanks.</div>

<div class="content">The 'sync' column did not help me. I went back to having my columns in this order:<br><br>Updated<br>Title<br>Notebook</div>

<div class="content">After getting my tasks greater than 250 items, I'm now looking at pruning it down to more comfortable level for preselection scanning. I should ...<br>(1) Finish more items.<br>(2) Consider done / someday maybe more items.<br>(3) Move some items to tickler for the future, that automatically appears in say 2 weeks or 1 month time.<br><br>That #3 should be easy to do in EN Windows. You can edit the updated date to a future date.<br><br>To hide these future items, I've modified my FV saved search from ...<br>notebook:"Final Version"<br>... to ...<br>notebook:"Final Version" -updated:day+1<br>... which should list all FV items updated before tomorrow.<br><br>Unfortunately that only works on EN Web, but not yet on EN Windows 4.5.5. <br><br>Anyway, seeing some of this "future" items at the top of  my list ain't that troublesome, so I think I'm still going to use this tickler method. :-)</div>

<div class="content">Somebody, *please* tell me not to go looking at these other Android/Web lists software for FV mentioned elsewhere here ...<br>* <a href="http://www.nozbe.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.nozbe.com/</a> - 5 years old.

<div class="content">We can tell you till we're hoarse, but will you listen? Noooooooo...! Don't forget to add Focus Pad to your list. :)<br><br>I really like Trello. Took some time to get into the list-card concept, once I wrapped my head around it, I was off and running. Great for collaboration too.</div>

<div class="content">Hehe, You're right JD.  I couldn't stop from "looking". But I managed to stop from "climbing" over the fence. Reverse order ...<br>* Checkvist - mobile web don't yet have reorder by dragging.<br>* Trello - did try on desktop on mobile earlier, so far limited to project list. I don't see myself using it for FV over EN.<br>* Nozbe - had another look at its website. It seems as full featured as EN Desktop/Android. Managed to resist installing Nozbe Android app for now. <br><br>So I'm still "firmly" FV'ing on EN Desktop/Android. :-}</div>

<div class="content">Oh JD, there is no FocusPad for Android yet as Tony Mann said in <a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/fv-forum/post/1762412#item1795209" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/fv-forum/post/1762412#item1795209</a> . So that's easily ignored. :-)</div>

<div class="content">Having seen the video in the earlier thread (which made things MUCH easier - having one note per task rather than all my tasks listed in one note), I've been finding Evernote Free works well.<br><br>One of the things that I've found helpful is to use the Created rather than Updated column for sorting the list, COMBINED WITH manually updating/overwriting the Created date if I have a task that I do some work on but don't finish (and should therefore go back onto the end of the list). Evernote on Windows happily lets you overwrite the Created (and Updated) dates, can't remember whether Evernote on Android lets you or not.<br><br>Using this technique, I use a tag (.DO) for selecting items for my chain rather than relying on the Sync dot which I can't control.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Tim,<br><br>Good to see another "satisfied" FV user of EN. :-)<br><br>EN Android can show you the note Created and Updated time but can't change it directly. EN Desktop Windows can do that, as you found.<br><br>Hence, I keep to using the Updated field for my FV list sorting. I found it works well enough. What specific reason to you prefer sorting by Created over by Updated, Tim?</div>

<div class="content">sabre23t, just some feedback on your "sync" tip. I've been using it since your post & find it most useful. I use it all the time. Thanks.</div>

<div class="content">(Repost - original post seems to have been lost)<br><br>Sabre,<br><br>My reasons for using the Created Date as the ordering mechanism are<br>* I can update the Created Date to move a task to the end of the list (e.g. if I've done some work on it but not finished it).<br>* I can add notes into tasks I'm not currently working on (e.g. if a colleague gives me some information that I want to write down before I forget it), without affecting its position in the list.<br>* I was finding that the Modified Date sometimes changed when I added or removed a tag, which would also alter its position in the list out of line with the FV rules.<br><br>I guess part of it is because I put notes (things I need to remember, progress made, etc.) into the body of task notes - which can be useful if someone asks me something about it later.</div>

<div class="content">Geoff, good to hear the "sync" dots are useful to you, as it is for me in preselecting the tasks. :-)<br><br>Tim, I also often add notes to tasks that I'm not working on. That of course, change the modified date, and bring those tasks to the earliest end of the list. However, I just consider that I've taken those tasks as FV "urgent" hence them getting to the end of the list. So sorting by modified state still works for me, and keep the advantage of automatic sorting of reentered tasks by just updating its notes.</div>
