<div class="content">I agree with Michael, but it looks like the Activity Selection System is based on a Browse, Assess, Denote preselection of tasks to complete, in other words it's BAD-ASS!</div>

<div class="content">Certainly good fun to be playing with these acronyms.<br><br>However, on a more serious note, I really am searching for another name for this system.  "Final Version" is meaningful to the in-crowd - those familiar with Mark and his work. But how to refer to it with other people? I have often mentioned to people about the great help I have obtained from using a system called Superfocus.  Sort of has a catchy "ring" about it, and the name relates to the purpose. Now what will I say... I have started using a great system called Final Version?  Huh?<br><br>Don't get me wrong - I am excited about FV, and it looks brilliant. Thanks, Mark! Just wish it had a more relatable name.</div>

<div class="content">Steve, <br>How about saying "Final Version" is either short for "Auto Super Focus Final Version" or for "Mark Forster's Final Version" ?</div>

<div class="content">I think "Final Version" is just for us.  These have all been versions of Autofocus, so I'd still just call it Autofocus to others.</div>

<div class="content">The term Autofocus has been broad for search engines and keywords. Makes it harder to find us or complementary partners.<br>From my review of Mark's literature, I've appreciated that we are not literally managing time, but rather where we are placing our awareness. Therefore, I like to think of this work as awareness management.</div>
