<div class="content">First thought that did come up: sounds and feels good. Gives you control over urgency, importance and what one "likes" to do in a balanced way ;)</div>

<div class="content">It also seems to encourage a flow state -  a balance between challenge and readiness</div>

<div class="content">I'm excited, and all the comments people are making have an air of mystery to me!<br><br>I just registered to the new Email Newsletter, and still awaiting instructions on FV.<br><br>I feel like a kid on Christmas awaiting his gifts!</div>

<div class="content">Congratulations Mark!<br><br>The system seems to address the problem I've had for years - logjam. When there's something I know I "should" do but don't "want" to do while  there's something I "could" do but feel i "shouldn't" do so I end up doing nothing useful. The new method of working the list looks like it offers a way to give  yourself the structure to get EVERYTHING done.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Mark, I think you did a great job at writing the first newsletter. It seems like all your work from the earlier versions pays off in terms of clarity and simplicity :)</div>

<div class="content">Pending my real life assessment of the effectiveness of the FV system, I want to echo BG's comment. I too found the writing in the newsletter a very good example of clear and concise language. It looks as if particular attention was given to this aspect (maybe through your own process of successive drafts, Mark?).<br><br>Thanks a lot.</div>

<div class="content">@caibre65:  I have this problem too.  Let's hope FV will banish logjam!</div>

<div class="content">@Mark, I received it, it is very clear and I started using it right away!<br><br>And I just got into a flow state and did the work. There was no resistance, it is amazing to me, this is pure genius!<br><br>Simply, yet profoundly powerful, this is your E=MC2 Mark!</div>

Mark's systems have helped more than anything else, until I fall off the system or "tweak" it (*roll eyes*). Let's see what FV can make of it!</div>

<div class="content">Mark: <br><br>Thank you for releasing this excellent system! I'm very excited about using it - you must have put in a massive amount of effort in developing it and yet the finished product is so simple and elegant. <br><br>In your very well written instructions you state *the aim of any time management system is to help you to get your work done, not get in the way of doing your work.* <br><br>When I think about systems like franklin covey and GTD I ask myself if this is the aim of these systems? I think they get in the way of productivity and of course must have the aim of shifting plenty of 'units' like planners and various other merchandise.<br><br>And then there is you, a very generous individual willing to share for free your insights. And what insights they are too!</div>
