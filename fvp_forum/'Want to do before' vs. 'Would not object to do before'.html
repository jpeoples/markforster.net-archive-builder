<div class="content">Sometimes I find myself asking the question "Would I object to doing task X before task Y" instead of "Do I want to do task X before task Y". Usually this comes about because I want to do task X before some task Z which has already been preselected above task Y, which is a topic already addressed here: <a href="../fvp_forum/'wrong' order on the list.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/fv-forum/post/1758607</a><br><br>Is this a worrisome observation and should I refrain from doing it? Or is it a valid question in the realm of FV?<br><br>Any other people who have been wondering about this?</div>

<div class="content">The very consciously worded question "What do I want to do before I do [task]" shouldn't be underestimated. To be honest, I never thought of either creating an abbreviation / trying to find a shorter version of or even rephrasing the question.<br><br>Objection has a negative connotation for me, especially if worded as in your example, and that is something I do avoid while knocking of tasks. I want to be positive, I want to have fun and I want to complete even boring / complex / repeating etc. stuff, because I can "reward" myself soon enough again :)<br><br>Do you a favour and try to stick to exactly the question Mark has identified for FV. It doesn't take long to scan a list with it and most importantly, it does positively influence your selection process.<br><br>Good luck!</div>

<div class="content">TijlK: I agree with Stefano. Stick with the official and definitive Final Version before experimenting.</div>

<div class="content">"What do I want to do before X?" results in a shorter and more focused chain than "Would I object to Y doing before X?" It's early days yet, but from what I've seen, short chains work better than long chains. I found even "I'd like to do Y around the same time as X" didn't work.</div>
