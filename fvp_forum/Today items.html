<div class="content">I have this routine when I come in the morning do my admin which consist of the following:<br>- flagged emails <br>- file paperwork<br>- follow up emails<br>- authorize expenses<br><br>After this I do items that absolutely needs to be done today.  Like a fixed deadline.<br><br>Only after the above two do I start my FVP (or FV) in the past.  I thus use FVP where there is no clear items I need to do.<br><br>Any thoughts on this?</div>

<div class="content">Nico:<br><br>It sounds a very sensible way of proceeding. Establishing routines is a very good way of getting work done.<br><br>Having said that, it is the exact opposite of what I do myself. I would make a task of each of the things you mention and let FVP establish the routine for me.<br><br>Please note I'm not saying my way is better than yours - merely that both ways will work and people can choose which suits them best personally.</div>
