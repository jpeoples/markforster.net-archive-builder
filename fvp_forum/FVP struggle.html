<div class="content">I have a struggle of not feeling like I have a handle on whatis coming my way which I need to work on.<br>For example: for next wed I might have wmeeting with joe" however I have things to do to prepare for said meeting. How can I use FVP (or something else) to KNOW that I can get the meeting prep done enough ahead of time?<br>I know that is a simple example, but I usually have at least 50 or so pending calendar items which I need to prepare for.<br>Any ideas?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Tommy, for me you could do it in many way. Using GTD is one on the best for this but there are many many ways....<br><br>My idea. For me only one word PLANIFICATION. <br><br>1. Is first having a list of your commitments and put in front on them a dead lines and may be some control points. Then report them in your diary. Then block some time to do it on your diary on time basis. That's what I do.  I do it during my weekly review but sometime in twice a week to adapt it. The purpous is to get a higher view. Like on a airplane. Read Getting things done perspective for this. <br><br>2. I simply to do it directly on you diary without a list. But there is a lack of global view on one point. So it is better to get a all list of your project and carefully think about which is the most crucial regarrding to your activities. <br><br>For me FV is an acting system. He just help you to do stuff on a day to do basis. But he doesnt give you a global view of each tasks relatives to projects nor a hierarchy of priorities regarding to your crucial comitments. But for acting and acting it does it very well ! If the list is not too long...</div>

<div class="content">Lets take a quick example <br><br>On your weekly review you have yours comitments (crucial points for you) on excel for example<br>Meeting with joe  W5 - Thurday <br>Project X   Deadline W6<br><br>Diary <br>Monday plan 8:00 > 9:00 Prepare joe's meeting<br>Wednesday morning general (no time) Control your folder about project y (Jo's meeting th.) <br>Tuesday 3:00 > 4:00 PM Work on project W (W6) <br>Or <br>Tuesday general (no time) Work on project W (W6)<br><br>It is great to have a list of comitments. You will never forget anything.</div>

<div class="content">Tommy:<br><br><<  I usually have at least 50 or so pending calendar items which I need to prepare for. >><br><br>As Jupiter says there are many ways of doing this. Here's how I would do it (and I'm not claiming that it's better than Jupiter's way, but it does adhere more to the spirit of FVP).<br><br>First of all, you need a recurring task "Check Calendar" on your FVP list which you aim to do at least once a day - preferably several times a day.<br><br>Whenever you see an item in your calendar which is getting near enough to think about preparing, put a "Prepare x" task on your FVP list, e.g. "Prepare Meeting with Joe". You may want to put the date of the meeting in brackets after it, e.g. "Prepare Meeting with Joe (Wed)". <br><br>When you do the "Prepare" task, use a Dynamic List to work through the actions needed to prepare for the meeting. A Dynamic List for an external meeting might read something like this:<br><br>Check location of meeting<br>Check route to meeting<br>Put leaving time in calendar<br>Set alarm<br>Find meeting papers<br>List points for meeting<br>Call Mike to discuss meeting objectives<br>Read background document<br>Review notes of previous meeting<br>Print out latest figures<br><br>Re-enter the "Prepare Meeting with Joe (Wed)" task so you can keep checking on any further action necessary.</div>

<div class="content">I think the root of my issue is a feeling of overwhelm & out of controlness. Possible that fvp (while a great tool) is not the tool to solve this.<br>Getting tasks done isn't necessarily my issue. My issue is having enough of a global view and being able to trust that the right things are getting worked on with enough time.<br>Will keep thinking...</div>

<div class="content">I use FVP and I work close to what Mark Forster describes above. I want to add one detail that helps me with that.<br><br>I use a digital calendar. Every appointment that needs preparation (or that I want to have on the radar for other reasons) gets "tagged" in it's title. For example: <br><br>Wed<br><<<Meeting with Joe>> #powerpoints>>><br><br>Now I can perform a search for #powerpoints to find all dates to which I have to prepare a BS-Powerpoints presentation.<br><br>The calendar usually sorts search results by date, so I get a quick overview of all my deadlines sorted by date.<br><br>This helps me to get clearheaded when performing the recurring FVP task "check calendar."</div>

<div class="content">Tommy, I only now saw your second post.<br><br>The thing with all the Autofocus lists is that while they *CAN* work as a catch-all, ad hoc project plan, they are not very good at it, if too many projects get worked on that way. (IMHO of course and also I am a FVP fan, hands down best TM system in my view.)<br><br>Sometimes directly at the start, more often only after working on it a few times, I do create a per project planning document out of what I have written down on the FVP list so far.<br><br>That clears things up and gives a better overview on the respective projects.<br><br>I am still experimenting how a general index of these major projects or some other form of lists of goals and missions etc pp could work for me.</div>
