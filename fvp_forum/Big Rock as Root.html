<div class="content">One thing that has saved me when I'm doing a big project, something like a thesis, writing a book or similar, is this:<br>At the top of my general FV list, I'll add "Work on the book" (the book or other project would then have its own separate planning document; could be an FV-style list, could be some other style that works for the project, I might use a mind map or an outline).<br><br>Then I'll make a chain with the question "Do I NEED to do Y before X?", aiming for the chain to be short but accepting if it's not. These are things that need to be done before I can start work on the big rock that day, like preparing the writing space, making sure I have food at home etc.<br>I'll do the chain down to the big rock and then work on the big rock for a while.<br>Then after that, I'll do a normal chain without the big rock at the top, with the top thing preselected as per normal FV (to make sure that I get some work done on the oldest thing) and using any question. If this second chain doesn't get completed (but it does sometimes), I'll just de-dot and the next day start over (i.e the "oldest task" would stay in place). The Big Rock is more important than old dusty stuff.<br><br>This system enables me to get to work on the Big Rock as soon as possible but still having the clear mind that comes from having made a fresh chain, having seen the whole list and knowing for sure that nothing is more important, more urgent than working on the Big Rock.<br><br>I only use this during those times when I am working on something big like that, otherwise I don't (because it does tend to punish those old unwanted tasks). I do love this method.</div>

<div class="content">This works best when working on the Big Rock is sort of rewarding in itself. I want to make the chain short so I can get to it.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Sandra, <br><br>Are you still having success with this method? I have a simple way of combing FV with a Big Rock so your feedback might be helpful. Thanks.</div>

<div class="content">Yes, I'm very happy with it.<br>In the morning:<br>1. De-dot any uncompleted chains from yesterday.<br>2. Put the big rock as root<br>3. Do a chain with only the things that absolutely NEED to be done before it (hopefully few to none, but if it's there, it's there). Doing them helps me get peace of mind so I can work on the big rock. This means that I do skip over dotting the first thing -- the "big rock" becomes the new first thing.<br>4. After working on the big rock for a good amount of time, if there's any time over, do normal chains. This is my chance to maybe, maybe get to the normal "first thing on the list".<br><br>I also go long periods of time without a big rock project. Just livin'.</div>
