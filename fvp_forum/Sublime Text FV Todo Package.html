<div class="content">I built a package for Sublime Text that supports the FV workflow.

<div class="content">Gp: forgive me, but what operating systems does this run on?<br><br>I have a Windows 7 Ultrabook as my main work computer, a Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet and a Galaxy Note 2 smartphone, so I do not use MacOS nor iOS.  My location does not allow me to view youtube clips easily (bandwidth problem, not political or security!).<br><br>I am currently finding Evernote working well across my devices, especially after reading Sarah's tips recently.<br><br>Roger J</div>

<div class="content">Totally cross-platform. Works on Windows, Linux, and Mac OSX. Evernote didn't really work for me as a productivity tool. Too many distractions. But to each their own.</div>

<div class="content">GPD, if you want people to use this thing, you really need to explain in more detail how to get it installed :P. Not everyone has ever used Sublime Text 2 or is savvy enough to install packages without an explanation. A "How to install?" explanation might be very helpful...<br><br>For the not so technically savvy: here are the instructions for Mac OS X (10.7 in my case).<br><br>1. Download and install Sublime Text 2 (free): <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.sublimetext.com/2</a><br>2. Download the GPD package in .zip format (there is a 'ZIP' button): https://github.com/Gimped/GPD<br>3. Extract the GPD-master.zip file and rename the folder to 'GPD' for clarity.<br>4. Move this 'GPD' folder into the packages folder of Sublime Text 2. It is probably located at /Users/yourusername/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages<br>5. Start (or restart) Sublime Text 2<br>6. Go to File -> New File if it didn't already open a new file.<br>6. Go to View -> Syntax -> GPD to tell Sublime Text that you want to use GPD to edit this file.<br>7. Type // and press Tab. Press Down to select the Boilerplate option<br>8. It will now create the four sections mentioned in the video.<br><br>Seems to be working fine now for me :).</div>

<div class="content">Hi TijlK,<br><br>Thanks for the feedback. You are right. I should have included more instructions. I will look to update my docs. I was waiting for this thing to get accepted into the Package Control repository. It is there now. Here are the steps (modified from your instructions):<br><br>1. Download and install Sublime Text 2 (free): <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.sublimetext.com/2</a><br>2. Start Sublime Text 2<br>3. Follow the instructions for installing Package Control into Sublime Text 2 here: <a href="http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control/installation" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control/installation</a> (will require a restart of Sublime)<br>4. Press Ctrl+Shift+P (Cmd+Shift+P for Mac) and type "PackageControl: Install Package" (without quotes) and press enter<br>5. Type "GPD" (without quotes) and press enter<br>6. Go to File -> New File if it didn't already open a new file.<br>7. Go to View -> Syntax -> GPD to tell Sublime Text that you want to use GPD to edit this file.<br>8. Type // and press Tab. Press Down to select the Boilerplate option<br>9. It will now create the four sections mentioned in the video.<br><br>The great thing about Package Control is that it will automatically update your version of the GPD package with the latest version that I ship. I have a lot of tweaks I have added since posting this. I am currently in the works on a "Notes" feature which I am super-excited to share with you all once I have it in a good state.<br><br>Thanks everyone for watching the video and downloading. Sorry that this is a little scattered right now, I will keep improving it. I use this tool everyday and I finding it pretty powerful. I am glad that some of you are willing to give it a shot and provide help to others.<br><br>Thanks again,<br><br>-Gp</div>
