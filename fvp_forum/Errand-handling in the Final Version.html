<div class="content">I am sure there is a simple, efficient solution to this that hasn't occurred to me yet, so I'm hoping it has occurred to one or more of you. What is a simple way to handle errands using the FV? Often my list has two or three trips on it I'd like to make. It is Saturday, and more likely than not at some point I will go out and knock out one or more of them. How do I use FV to decide when to go?<br><br>In the past, I've added a task called "schedule errands" and when it was selected, I picked a time in the future at which I'd interrupt FV and go do errands. Is that a good practice, or is it better to select the task when you actually want to do it? Should multiple trips or errands be consolidated on the list?<br><br>How do you handle this sort of thing?</div>

<div class="content">Austin:<br><br>Probably the best way is just to do them at the same time(s) each week. Keep a separate list of errands and have a permanently scheduled time to do them. For example my wife always does the food shopping on Wednesday afternoons.</div>
