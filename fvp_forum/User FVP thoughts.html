<div class="content">Now that we've all been having fun for awhile using Mark's new method FVP, I'd love to hear what your thoughts/experiences are. How's it working? What have you noticed? Paper or digital? Likes & dislikes? Etc..</div>

<div class="content">I really like it!  But when the list started getting too long, or when I was adding a lot of new tasks, there tended to be too many comparisons.   On paper, this was causing me to "tune out" to the list -- I just couldn't get myself to focus my eyes on all those items, and conscientiously do the compares.   Ultimately this led me to resist using the method altogether.   <br><br>So I tried using Andreas's web app -- that helped a lot!   I didn't need to deal with so many items on a page, or with the page-flipping when comparing items on different pages.   Using the webapp also began to highlight how many compares you have to do, when things are moving quickly (adding new items to the list in little bursts, mixed with re-entries).   Even with the web app, that started getting tedious.   Tap on my phone, tap tap tap tap tap tap tap take action.   Add a few tasks.   Tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap take action.   Lots and lots of tapping.   I'd get to doing it quickly, which would lead me to stop reading closely, and then skip over a task I really "wanted to do more than X" but had already tapped past it and couldn't figure out how to roll back the last tap.  LOL<br><br>The thing that I *really* liked about the web app, was the ability to compare JUST TWO ITEMS.  It really helped me stay focused, and actually work the system.   But it also led me to question whether an exhaustive comparison of all items was really needed.<br><br>Looking at only two items at a time reminded me of SMEMA, which has always had a certain appeal for me.   Then someone else mentioned SMEMA, too, and this gave me an idea to reduce the number of comparisons, and to move the system into OneNote, which is where I track all my projects.  <br><br>So today, between meetings, I started collecting a list of tasks in OneNote and called it "FVP".  It became my catch-all.   But if anything seemed pressing, or simply top-of-mind or "standing out", I would move it to another list I called "SMEMA".   I tried to keep this list really short, 2-3 items, but sometimes it got up to 5.   If it got to be more than that, I'd just move the oldest ones back to FVP, so I could focus on just 2-3 items.   Then I'd keep hammering on those items till I felt like pulling in some more.    To do that, I'd look at my FVP list, and grab a few that stood out, or I just felt like doing, and move them over to SMEMA.  I'd try to do this quickly, running down the list and asking, "what do I want to do more", or really, just grabbing the first handful of tasks that got my attention, and move them to the SMEMA list.   Then I'd turn to the SMEMA list, and keep focusing on it, and hammering away till they were done (or maybe had 1 left).  And then I'd repeat.<br><br>This is totally ad-hoc and probably not scalable / sustainable, but it worked great today!   So I tried it at home this evening with my personal list, and it worked great too.   <br><br>However, I am guessing it wouldn't last more than a few days, because then the list will get too long again.   That always happens with me, with "catch all" systems.   But here is how I think I might be able to handle that:  if the list gets too long, I can just "dismiss" it, and start over with a new, empty FVP list.   Then once a week (or more, if I feel like it), I can scan over the dismissed lists and see if anything still needs doing.   I was essentially doing this with my personalized DIT-like method, before FVP came along, and it was working really well.<br><br>Also, that kind of dismissal is essentially what I've been doing these last several days, when I switched from paper FVP to webapp FVP then to OneNote FVP/SMEMA.   Each time I switched over, and started with a fresh list, it kept me moving, and I got good results both with larger projects and with recurring maintenance trivia.   I didn't delete the older lists -- I kept them handy, and would copy over some items from time to time to my new list.</div>

<div class="content">I started with a paper list. That got messy quick. Then I jumped all over the Andreas' wonderful web app. One for work and one for home. Went through a lot of bumps with that, mostly with trying to copy and paste huge lists to both. Simplified both into just using the app on my phone, which I used yesterday and today. The simplicity was liberating, but I too was cycling through a lot of stuff over and over again. I then tried paper for a bit with the "exciting" question. That was ok, but the stuff I needed to get done that day fell back as it wasn't really exciting, or at least not to me at the time. I went back to the simple version of the web app, and was mostly happy. <br><br>Tonight at work I tried doing Mark's new experimental version of FVP with a paper list and "no question". It was weird at first, but seemed easier to get through. Then it seemed kind of fast actually... <br><br>As it stands now, I'm going to keep working with the paper list and the quick scanning method. That feels the most "right" right now, but who knows?</div>

<div class="content">Like Roger J I've been away from this forum and Mark's experiments for a couple of years. I too had converted to Todoist but FVP sounded promising so I've been using it this week. I've gone back to paper and pen and am following the rules faithfully.<br><br>Starting each new scan from the point of the just-completed task makes a big difference.<br><br>I practiced a few times by randomizing a list of the numbers 1-20 to get the hang of it and prove to myself it works. That was very helpful.<br><br>I use my iPhone reminders app to capture things when I'm away from my paper list. Siri makes that fast and easy.<br><br>I have an app called Due for recurring and repetitive tasks that come up weekly, monthly, annually, etc. As they come up I write them on my paper list.<br><br>FVP on paper is, so far, very effective. It's easier to write on my list than go to my laptop, switch to Todoist, and type. And it's *much* easier to prioritize.<br><br>I'm not sure yet how to handle projects. I've got a few that I'll be moving to paper so I'll need to work that out.<br><br>Starting today I'm using Mark's questionless sort. So far, so good. Feels right to me.<br><br>Bottom line - I'm glad something (not sure what) prompted me to check in on the forum. For me FVP is simple, fast, and effective. So far.</div>

<div class="content">Paper. So far, it has worked better than any other system I have used in a number of years. One problem is that I am not always intentional enough to ask the question. Sometimes, I just scan and dot tasks that stand out. Thinking of changing to digital because the list has gotten quite messy and with 10 pages total, I do not want to have to re-write.</div>

<div class="content">@Roger J<br><br>Yes, and I have Todoist on my iPhone. But for me it's quite a bit easier and faster to write and read with paper and pen. I end up spending a lot of time in Todoist looking by priority, then at labels, then at overdue, then at specific projects, etc. My own fault, probably. With paper I write and go. Easy to highlight, bold, star, happy-face, etc. And no squiggly red lines!</div>

<div class="content">@Mark.Thanks. Scanning has worked, but I had been wondering if not asking the question messed up the algorithm. Evidently, the "algorithm question" regarding the "question" has generated much discussion. Am curious if others also drop the question.  <br><br>I am going to implement your suggestion of crossing out and re-entering the tasks. (I was resistant to this idea for some reason.)<br><br>@Neil. I understand. I have tried digital so many times, but I always return to paper. The aesthetics and the tangible nature of paper are something I am drawn too as well.</div>

<div class="content">I've had really good results using just the original FVP question, ("What do I want to do more than X...")   <br>I can't really imagine the 'Exciting' question working for me, as many of my important tasks feel like the polar opposite of exciting - but as Mark rightly alludes, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. <br>For now, though, I'm interested in trying the algorithm with no question, which I think I'll trial today if I get the chance.</div>

<div class="content">@sobertruth   I hear you. I sometimes like the 'idea' of a digital method, but in reality it's never come close to the good old pencil and paper approach for me, which are "a uniquely portable magic" (to paraphrase Stephen King's description of books).</div>

<div class="content">For awhile now I've been using Maniana Todo List app for Android. Since all tasks move from maniana over to the today list at midnight, all I do is in the morning is run through the list. I find myself saying "not today" to most of the tasks and sending them to the maniana list. It works great to give clarity of what I have/want to get done today. Recently I've used FVP on my today list & it is working great! Since the today list typically is fairly small after sending "not-today" tasks to the maniana list. This seems to really solve the main "issue" with FVP, that the list is too long to be scanning, as my today list is much more managable. Really then FVP becomes a method to work my list of things I already know I'd like to work on today. Gets them done in the order that I most want to do. Awesome!<br>Just thought I'd share.</div>

It relies entirely on "standing out" in the old AF1 sense of the task feeling ready to be done, though unlike AF1 it won't necessarily be done immediately.<br><br>I'm coming to think that the "No Question" version of FVP is not really like the other FV/FVP versions which use a question. Unlike with them, the algorithm is not really ranking anything in order. It's just a very efficient method of pre-selection. It is probably best thought of as a development of AF1.</div>

Excel for this purpose is a simple tool.  So are OneNote and the iPad based Cloud Outliner.

<div class="content">Hi Alan,<br><br>I am still using FVP on a small A7 paper notebook. But I will definitely be doing FVP on one of my digital online list apps in the future. Most likely checkvist.com / m.checkvist.com, though fargo.io / android outliner pro still in the running.<br><br>However, FVP on paper is always less "friction" than digital ...<br>(1) Paper notebook is a 3D stack of paper, but digital list representation via scroll bar, page scrolling vs line scrolling, has more "friction".<br>(2) Paper dotting, active item marking, crossing, rewrite; need related action (or actions) in digital list, these are usually more "friction". Even with simple digital lists like Excel.<br><br>Hence, I am doing FVP on paper first to build up my "FVP willpower muscle memory" before I can afford to tackle using FVP on digital list with its "higher friction".

<div class="content">I agree with both Sabre23 and Alan. Alan: a flat list like excel is better than a computer option where you cant see everything but Sabre is right that the is still less friction when done on paper. I tried doing the questionless method on excel vs paper and it works so smoothly on paper, I could not get it to work that way by scrolling in excel. My issue on paper is that you cannot link easily to emails and for other reference materials but I think I have a way around that and thus the best of both worlds for me. If true, I will let you (all) in on it.</div>

I think the saving in time by having links to emails and other materials in one's list is largely illusory - in fact I strongly suspect that it slows the whole process down.

<div class="content">As I spend my working life in MS Outlook, it is natural to use the task list as THE list. So, for instance, when I do a batch of mail, anything that's going to take be more than a few seconds to deal with gets flicked into the todo list. Ctrl+K adds a new manual task.

<div class="content">I get several emails every day which need more attention, maybe some more careful reading, thinking, or an extensive reply, or just some one-off action that will take 5-20 minutes to complete.   These aren't project-related -- they are often new requests/demands that need attention.   How would you handle this kind of email?   They aren't easy handled as part of my "clear email" task.

Let me repeat back what I think you are saying (based on what you've written here and in your other FVP examples), to make sure I am understanding it clearly.  <br><br>When you work on your recurring task "email", you try to clear all your new emails in one go:<br>- if a new email is project-related, you tag the email with a project tag, and enter the project name on your FVP list<br>- if a new email needs larger action that you can't complete right now, you flag it as "Active"  (or, if all your incoming emails are automatically flagged as Active, you just leave it flagged that way) (I believe NEO gives you some options here, how to use the "Active" indicator)<br>- otherwise, reply or take action on the new email as needed, then delete/deactivate/archive the email<br>- if you still have any Active emails that arrived today, you try to clear them out<br>- if any Active emails are still on your list from the previous day, you tag them as Email Backlog and get them off your Active list, which is reserved for emails that arrived today that still need action<br><br>When you work on your task "email backlog", which you enter on your list whenever any Active emails from the previous day are still needing to be processed, you try to clear out all the emails tagged with "Email Backlog":  take action, finish them off, or delete if no longer needed.<br><br>Is that basically correct?<br><br>If yes, I would imagine that on some days, if you happen to get a lot of one-off emails that each require a lot of time to complete the associated actions, you might end up with an email backlog that lasts for a few days?   <br><br>I also imagine you'd aim to keep the email backlog as a "closed list".   And if you find yourself adding to it before finishing what's already there, then this would be a sign that you can't keep up with your email, and need to re-evaluate your commitments that are generating so much of it, or maybe come up with better ways to delegate, filter out less relevant emails like reading material, etc.   <br><br>Is that about right?   Please let me know if I got this wrong -- this is probably one of the hardest areas for me right now with using FVP [or AFP as I have been tending to call it, after you noticed it's more like AF than FV!  :-)  ]</div>

<div class="content">Just a thought I've had while cranking through my FVP list today: FVP boosts my productivity because the chain is a no-brainer. Once I've chosen a chain of tasks that stand out, I just line up and do them. No further thinking or evaluating is necessary.  When I'm done with task, I enjoy crossing it off, and then I immediately look to the next task as a potential source of positive reinforcement if I can cross it off as well.</div>

<div class="content">I took a few excursions into trying to manage my lists in OneNote, rather than on paper.   It had the (apparent) advantage of being able to capture tasks "with details attached".   Ideas, projects, reminders to myself captured with Siri, emails that need action, etc., are all easy to capture in OneNote.   But the list would get really long, really quickly, and the number of selected tasks would get too large (because so many things would "stand out", despite Mark's posts about how to control what stands out).  <br><br>So I am currently trying a different approach, based on the way Mark describes his email handling, above.   I'm trying to treat my emails in basically the same way, and also treat my OneNote stuff the same way.   It's not really working very well yet, but I'll keep at it and see if I can get it to work.</div>

<div class="meta">2015-06-22 1:15</div>
<div class="content">As an aside, I think the reason so many things would "stand out", despite all of Mark's suggestions (which are excellent and really have made a difference), is that I'd have a hard time keeping "in tune" with the list.   The list would be too long, and it would be too much to process all at once.   I'd feel the need to group it somehow.   I'd grab all the stuff in my OneNote list that "stood out" -- it would often be 10-20 items.   Then I'd go through THAT list and pull out what "stood out" even more.   And maybe repeat a third time.   Finally I'd have a short list -- interestingly, it would almost always be (1) a handful of quick tasks, or (2) a bunch of related tasks I need to do as a single group.   Working through these short list was a BREEZE, always super easy.<br><br>This led me to try basing my whole system around this repeated-standing-out-and-grouping model.   But it got really complicated, how to interleave these groups of things, with new incoming items.   <br><br>In retrospect, I was totally overthinking the problem.   <br><br>So now I've made two changes, and they are working OK for now, still needs some getting used to, but I am liking it, and I am able to get that "grouping into a short easy list" feeling:<br><br>(1) I just spin off a separate list as needed, going through the AFP list and pulling out whatever I need.   This can bring immediate clarity to the list, and helps "weed" the list too.   I've just been writing ad-hoc lists on the left-hand page of the notebook, or sometimes using a sheet in the back of the notebook.  In my Moleskine, the pages in back are tear-off sheets, so I can just rip it out if needed and go work that separate list for a bit.<br><br>(2) Rather than treating OneNote as my main list, I just treat it like another inbox.  I capture all kinds of notes, emails, voice memos, screen shots, web clippings, etc., in OneNote, into a QuickNotes page.   I keep the main list in my Moleskine notebook, and I keep a "Quicknotes" task on there.</div>

<div class="content">(Another aside - I agree with Mark that Questionless FVP "feels" a lot more like AF1 than FV, so I've been calling it AFP = Autofocus Perfected, as Mark suggested.   But that doesn't seem to be catching on, so maybe I should just call in Questionless FVP like everyone else.)</div>

<div class="content">What Mark has come up with is an efficient sorting method or algorithm. If you follow the FVP rules with a list of random numbers you'll find that it sorts the numbers from largest to smallest perfectly and efficiently every time. So your list of tasks will also sort perfectly from "largest" to "smallest" every time (assuming you've accurately assigned priority).<br><br>If you change Mark's rules you're probably making the algorithm less efficient, probably by causing yourself to reevaluate priorities you've already made a decision about. You'll see this if you try FVP'ing the list of random numbers. When you cross a number off the list you only have to compare those below it to the nearest dotted number above it. No need to reevaluate those in between the two.<br><br>Work halfway through the list of random numbers and add new numbers to it (like adding new tasks to your ongoing todo list). Follow the rules and the largest numbers are once again selected perfectly and efficiently. (This is why you do more work at the end of the list. Numbers [tasks] 'left behind' at the top of the list are, of course, smaller numbers (less important tasks). Odds are that new random numbers [tasks] added to the list will be larger [more important].)<br><br>And what question do you use, if you choose to use one at all? If, at the end of the day, you had done all your tasks in the optimum order what question would have given you that order? What question would properly assign numbers so the FVP algorithm sorts them into the proper order? My guess is the quetion changes. What do I want/need/have to do before X? What is wiser/smarter/weightier/more valuable to do than X?</div>

I can't see why this shouldn't work just fine."<br><br>I've been battling with this.  For example, what happened to me today is that it started out with emails and phone calls, and it was late afternoon before I could catch my breath.

However, I feel that, in the end, I will end up feeling frustrated and defeating the whole purpose.  <br><br>But am I thinking right?  If you are working off a short list, and you want to go back to that item on the long list (FVP) and scan down from that just-completed task as per the rules, who knows where on the main FVP list that item might be located (and how significant a scan-down from that item would be)?<br><br>I think as time goes on, and your priorities gain some control, this desire or need to deviate from the standard FVP will be rare.  But, without the short list, I guess the drawback is having to re-write so many tasks at the end of the list.  But what can you do?  Anyway, the whole thing as it stands is so simple, it's great.  Why mess it up?  Thanks.</div>

<div class="content">BKK<br><br>Presumably the new ones will be below the task you've just finished?

There isn't a separate list.<br><br>If you really have boggled and lost confidence that your latest task was still the one to work on next, you can always simply strike out and rewrite at the bottom all your dotted tasks until you are confident you are above the real priorities, then standard FVP will highlight them and work them in an appropriate order. <br><br>Or just strike out your dots and start again.

However, my "short list" was not simply a list of the dotted items; they consisted of new and already-listed-but-scattered items.

<div class="content">In a post yesterday I said:<br><br>"And it's perfectly ok to omit or skim the full scan if you know or suspect that there are no tasks which are likely to stand out beyond where you've got to. "<br><br>I'd like to add that it's also perfectly ok to omit or skim the scan if you don't *want* any more tasks to stand out, i.e. you want to work on the already dotted tasks only for a period. In which case you are basically doing what you do with FV.<br><br>Using this principle you can turn FV on and off as and when you wish without actually leaving FVP.</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br>"But that *is* FVP. Where does FV come into it?"<br><br>You're right, that is FVP! For whatever reason I've been doing it wrong the whole time! Ha. The rare times I've actually made it back to the first task I've been in the habit of starting over! Scanning back down the list and dotting tasks again, from the beginning. I think when you first introduced FVP, I saw the description of how one might never do the first task and formed an impression of what that meant. I guess I can now join the rest of you in actually using FVP. Ha!</div>

<div class="content">nick61<br><br>"i sometimes feel resistance in scanning the list over and over again after the execution of each task"<br><br>You're only scanning downward from the task you just finished, comparing it to the nearest dotted task above, right? Try following the rules with a list of random numbers and you'll see that FVP is very efficient, it minimizes scanning.</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br>"Do you mean you were re-scanning from the first task *before* you did it?"<br><br>Yep. Ha. Went right back to step 1: Dot the first active task on the list. "Oh, hey! Look at that. The first task is already dotted. And I may never have to do it, either. Great! I'll just scan down this list of mine, see if there's something I want to do more than that, and, mhmm, I'll dot that one there, and this one, and, oh, that one over there...dot, dot, dot. Hooray! Resisted task avoided."</div>
