<div class="content">My grand daughter was born last night, so I may have more important concerns for a few days than commenting on the Forum (shock! horror!). I'm sure you'll all survive for a bit without me.</div>

<div class="content">All the best. Had my first grand child 2 years ago. Yesterday, when I picked him up from the nursery, the first thing he said to his daddy is, "where is our car?". He didn't recognize my car, and is worried about his father's car. Kids are direct and precious. :-)<br><br>Enjoy you grand daughter, Mark. They grow up all too fast. Especially when you don't see them everyday.</div>

<div class="content">Great news, Mark. I wish I knew when we're going to get grandkids. (Children can be so selfish!)</div>

<div class="content">I wish you all the happiness, and really feeling the aliveness that comes from spending your tine with your newborn grand daughter.<br><br>When it comes down to it, that's what life is all about, and we're all aiming to be more productive so that we can spend time with our beloved ones doing what we most cherish and enjoy!</div>
