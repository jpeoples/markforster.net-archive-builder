<div class="content">I would like to ask those people who have experience with both Dreams and Final Version, if (or how) your understanding of and using of push/pull mode developed. I am reading Dreams again now and I realize that Dreams are based solely on pull mode (and push is considered more "unwanted"). On contrary, final version was several times described as having the right mix of push/pull mode, which is closer to my understanding and personality. And which is the reason I like it so much.<br><br>That strictness in absolute preferring pull over push mode was the reason I was not very keen on Dreams before. Now, considering balance between push/pull, I started to rehabilitate Dreams for me. Do you have some ideas on push/pull balance after some time experimenting with Dreams and FV? New experiences? Developments in understanding? Thanks a lot.</div>

<div class="content">My use and understanding of both has developed this way:<br><br>My impression is that the more attractive my future vision is the more it will inspire actions in the present inspired from within me. Because it aligns with the deepest part of me it energises hope and optimism. When my future vision feels very attractive it holds my thought and emotional attention on it, rather than on current circumstances. It uplifts!<br><br>The less attractive and delightful the future vision is the more one's actions are repetitions of the past - influenced from obligations, duties, responsibilities to current circumstances or responses to other's expectations and desires, leading to degrees of lack of freedom. "Upgrades" to life then often come after fear or suffering which may stretch thinking into new ideas and create a new perspective, which is what Mark's future self offers in "Dreams".<br><br>Imagination is the vital component. Life can't be more than you can imagine it to be or believe is possible.<br><br>What sorts of things are filling the Final Version lists? Are they things that are responses to externals or are they self-initiated inspirations from a dream within? How about running down the list and tagging each with "V" (vision) or "R" (responding)?<br><br><a href="http://nevillegoddard.wwwhubs.com/neville1.htm" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://nevillegoddard.wwwhubs.com/neville1.htm</a> is a dated but adequate exposition</div>

<div class="content">In FV, one might perform the same actions that would come about from Dreams, but in Dreams they would be perceived as 100% Pull while in FV they would appear to be a balance of Push and Pull.<br><br>In Dreams, the explicit process of visioning dissolves the mundane or annoying tasks into the excitement of accomplishing the larger vision, just as I will eagerly run and run and run until out of breath to play a sport but can hardly drag my feet for a fraction of that effort in the name of jogging.<br><br>In FV, without the visions explicitly defined, the same supporting tasks come along in Push Mode, as necessary evils, and the vision remains implied by one's actions.<br><br>There's no reason we can't combine Dreams with FV. After developing a Pull-worthy vision, if we feel Pulled toward keeping track of our tasks, we can write them into an FV list. As we construct our chains, a sense of Pull will lead us to dot the right tasks, which otherwise might have slipped our minds due to sheer volume or level of detail. Pull Mode doesn't guarantee perfect recall, especially where due dates, prerequisites, or logistics are concerned, so there is still plenty of room to use a "system."</div>
