<div class="content">Has anyone worked out an effective way of using FVP with Toodledo? It would be the ideal combination for me but the program does not sort tasks by date and time added strictly enough. I have tried tagging the time, and variations of it,  but this makes the process laborious and makes for a lot of tags, as does tagging them by numerical sequence.<br><br>I'd be grateful to hear of a solution which does not create too much "overhead."</div>

<div class="content">Gadgets,<br><br>I keep my FVP list in Toodledo sorted by Date Added.  That way all new tasks are added to the bottom of the list.  I use the Star feature of Toodledo to mark the tasks I am going to work on.  For tasks that I work on but don't complete, I first clone the task, which puts a copy of it at the bottom where it belongs (after a screen refresh) and then mark the original task as "done".  If I want to track something I worked on in the task, I update the note in the original task before I clone it.  This system has been working very well for me for quite some time.</div>

<div class="content">Hi tomcal,<br>as far as I see toodledo can sort by date added, but will not consider the time when the Task was added. Thus toodledo sorts not in the order I enter the Tasks...</div>

<div class="content">Thank you both for your posts. I've put a feature request in to Toodledo. Not holding my breath but I'll post if they accede to it as I do feel it would be the ideal tool for FVP if the feature existed.</div>
