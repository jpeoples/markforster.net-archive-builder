<div class="content">is there any way us loyal fans/readers can help keep forum clean of junk? Maybe move to moderated but a few of us review, so that it does not all fall on Mark to waste time checking every post?<br><br>Or closed to only member posting, although that be a shame.<br><br>amazing how the spam now has spam comments, how creative<br><br>must be some time manage joke, just not thinking of one</div>

<div class="content">matthewS:<br><br>There isn't a moderation option on the forums. The choices available are:<br><br>1) No control at all. Attracts a large number of spam posts, very difficult to keep on top of them.<br><br>2) Captcha (the present setting). Cuts the number of spam posts down to zero most days, with occasional bursts of activity, which are relatively easy to clear. Unfortunately the last burst of spamming activity, a particularly large one, took place in a period when I didn't look at the forums for several days.<br><br>3) Members only posting. Frankly a pain in the neck both for posters and for me - who has to sort out all the problems with it. There are only a limited number of membership slots available on my current subscription. To increase them, would cost me more.<br><br>My conclusion is therefore: thanks for the offer of help, but in fact the present arrangement is about as good as it gets.</div>

<div class="content">What would you recommend members do if they want to alert you about spam that comes up?</div>

<div class="content">Nothing. If I haven't seen the spam posts then I won't see your alert either.</div>
