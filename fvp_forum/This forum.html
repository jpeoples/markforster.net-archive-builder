<div class="content">Since the arrival of FV, I'm finding the forum diminished <br>- in traffic (though I admit this impression is anecdotal:  I haven't done a study to analyse the trend numerically, and I recognise that things are complicated by the splitting of the forum into two sections)<br>- in interest (which of course is an entirely subjective matter). <br><br>I am contrasting things with the outpouring of chatter, which I found valuable, that marked the arrival of AF1 etc.<br><br>I write this not to be rude to MF or the many contributors here, but to make the opposite point.  I believe that the contributions are reduced because there is not much to say, as FV just works.  For me, at any rate; and for now; I hope that the effect does not wear off.</div>

<div class="content">Well, after using a free-flowing , easy, nothing-left-undone way of working we need a new challenge? How about applying FV to areas of life that are not as satisfying and linking it to the "Dreams" methods?</div>

<div class="content">David C:<br><br>I have to say that has not been my impression. I haven't gone back to count the number of posts in the early days of AF1, but to me it seems as if the volume has returned to something comparable.<br><br>Since I launched FV on 13 March there have been 1,731 comments on the two forums and the blog combined.</div>

<div class="content">David,<br><br>"I believe that the contributions are reduced because there is not much to say, as FV just works."<br><br>I'm inclined to agree. As you said, this is not an insult. This is a result of Mark's system that runs so well right out of the gate that the need for endless discussion is more limited to those who just like talking about such things. I count myself as one of those people, and remarkably I find that I have less desire to post lately. I'm just so excited about using FV to get my own Work done that I am thinking less and less about FV. That is a compliment of the highest order. The system is disappearing, leaving only the Work. <br><br>I liken it to walking or driving. Your legs or your car are just the tool you use to get somewhere. If they are working properly, then you don't really think about them. You just go. That is what's happening to me with FV. That's why I really think it's the best task management tool I've ever used. <br><br>As an aside, much of the time I would usually spend reading or posting or tweaking my system has been spent sharing and teaching Mark's FV to others. Spreading the word outside of the converted, so to speak.</div>

<div class="content">I agree to an extent...<br><br>I get a huge buzz when I explain BlancList to people that ask what I'm working on, and they say "is that it?". Magic!<br><br>I think there is some room for a forum to figure out fringe cases and ways to implement the system. I guess for the same reason Mark asked for FAQs, learning is easy, mastering it can be a little trickier. Could be me though :)<br><br>Although I've spent a fair bit of time on BlancList, the one thing I've stopped doing is looking for a better system, now it's just a case of getting better at living with it. Turning my crawl into a run :)</div>

<div class="content">The forum is definitely busier now than it was before FV was released, when it was very quiet.  <br><br>When SuperFocus came out, there was a lot of busyness discussing variations of SuperFocus, how to make it work, and all kinds of alternative systems for those who didn't like SuperFocus.  Now there seems to be 90% contentment with the system and not much need for variations or techniques.  Just enough to keep us busy for a while.<br><br>I hope when this phase declines we can get busy discussing bigger things like what we're doing, and pursuing goals and such.</div>
