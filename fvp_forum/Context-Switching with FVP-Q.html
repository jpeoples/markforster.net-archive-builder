<div class="content">One thing I really like about Questionless FVP is that I can use a single list for all my tasks, both work and personal.   It has always been difficult to do this with AF1 or DWM or other systems.<br><br>In practice, it works like this.  Let's say it's Monday morning and I am just arrived at work after a busy weekend at home.  The most recent tasks are all personal, but I don't need to go back very far till I find a cluster of work items from last Friday.  As I work through these, and add new work items that come to mind or arise through the course of the day, the system also gives me plenty of chances to review the loose ends remaining in my personal items from the weekend.  Maybe there are some personal calls to make that could not be done till Monday, for example.  I can take care of those very easily by just handling them at an opportune moment during the day, or scheduling time during lunch, or whatever works.  The point is that I still see and review them simply during the normal course of working the system and getting ramped up on all my work tasks for the day.  <br><br>After working the list for a bit, I have seen all those personal tasks several times, and eventually find there are no loose ends, everything is in order and can wait till the evening or the next weekend before giving those tasks any real attention.   By this time, I am already half a page or more beyond those personal tasks, and getting in the groove of my work tasks, and stay focused on them near the end of the list.    Occasionally, as I simply work the system, I find myself on earlier pages, and when I finish something I scan through those personal tasks again (together with everything else); but by this point I have a good idea of what tasks remain there, and can just quickly skim through them, and remain focused on my work tasks.<br><br>This all feels very natural and easy.  And the same thing happens with other kinds of context-switching as well, such as changing from Project A to Project B, or from "focus work" to "overhead/maintenance", or whatever.  <br><br>Does anybody else combine Work and Personal in a single FVP or FVP-Q list?</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br><< Does anybody else combine Work and Personal in a single FVP or FVP-Q list? >><br><br>Yes, I do - but then I have always done that whatever the system. It's easy for me as I work from home and don't really make any distinction between one type of "work" and another.<br><br>But nevertheless I totally agree with you. Apart from anything else FVP is very time sensitive. It will go through my early morning routine tasks and my late evening routine tasks without these needing to be identified as such. It's only at a major break, such as overnight, that I normally feel the need to re-prioritize any tasks - and even then it's rare for it to be more than one or two.</div>

You mentioned Project A and Project B.  Are those references only on your FVP list with the project lists handled separately?  Or do you intersperse the project list items throughout your FVP list?  I've tried it both ways and my brain seems to prefer the former.  That way when I'm working in Project A, that is all I see.  Sometimes, I'll work the entire Project A list FVP style and then return to my regular FVP list when I've made significant progress on Project A.  I use Pomodoros often and try to decide up front how many pomodoros I'll do in Project A before returning to my full FVP list.<br><br>How do you handle it?</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim, I experience the same. With AF1 and other AF-incarnations I always struggled with the question of separate or combined home-work lists, and neither worked very satisfactorily after a while. With FVP it's a no-brainer, everything just goes on the list and the system handles the context, just as you describe.</div>
