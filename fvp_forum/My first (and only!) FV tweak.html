<div class="content">Hi,<br><br>I'm not a tweaker-- really I'm not! But I am starting to use one in FV, and since Mark has noted he has probably tried (and did not incorporate) many variations to the system, I wonder if he had tried this one, and curious to hear others thoughts as well.<br><br>I am marking (using outlook) tasks that are "in progress." They do not affect the selection process, but when I ask myself "The Question" I find it useful to know quickly if I had started something already or not. With 626 items on the main FV list (yes it is growing not shrinking, but I am confident I am getting everything collected and the right things done) it does help to have this little cheat in place.<br><br>For anyone using outlook and curious how I am doing this, in my master FV view I made a conditional formatting rule to slightly enlarge any task that has a %complete greater than 0%. I don't measure % complete it is either at 0 or greater, and those that are greater now pop a little on my list.</div>

<div class="content">vhj: we are ALL tweakers! ;-))))<br><br>It seems to me you are using Outlook tasks as a feeder into the FV List, others use various feeders as well so that FV does not get overwhelmed with dross.  I use Carpe Diem as a first dump if it's not urgent and/or 'I want to do this'.<br><br>Like others, I am using Evernote (Windows on notebook, Android on smartphone, synchronised via the web account).  One of its pluses for me is the notes body can contain one's progress or not, or updating the % completion, whatever.<br><br>I find I am putting in steps and next actions into the notes body of each note/task.  This way I can see progress, or not.<br><br>With checklists, I can copy part of the checklist or the whole checklist into FV.  Last weekend I cam home from an overseas assignment ans copied my newish 'Returning home checklist' in toto into FV, yet retaining the 'unchecked' version in my Checklists stack in Evernote for next time.<br><br>Other forum members will know I'm a great advocate of checklists, precisely because I cannot remember what I need to remember without them.  Thanks to Evernote, I have checklists by 'location/function' eg Personal (that which I carry about my person, starts with 'passport, flight documents, shoes. . . . jacket etc), Cabin Bag (usually a , Checkin Case #1, Checkin Case #2</div>

<div class="content">I do use my  FV list as a master list, dumping everything in there and preselecting off of the Question. As with Mark's other systems, I find that theis universal capture works well. The list is sorted by oldest to newest (I use due dates for this) and I mark things high priority if the answer is Yes to the the Question. I have a separate view that shows only high priority items, from newest to oldest, which is my preselected list that I work over. And, that preselect list does not have this tweak, it is only used during the selection process.</div>

I'm still trying to figure out exactly why.  :-)</div>

My FV list is currently 150+, but I do have a backlog of about 80+ old tasks yet to be entered into my FV list.</div>

<div class="content">Is the "mark previously started tasks" tweak a success?  If I understand right, it just means if I re-enter a task unfinished, I re-enter it with a * beside it so I know next time that it's active.</div>

<div class="content">Alan: It's not in the rules, so I consider it a tweak. In addition, Mark has had Foci systems where started but not finished tasks are treated differently, so I am curious if he had (and then discarded) anything to do with unfinished tasks.</div>

<div class="content">Using EverNote here based on a tutorial on YouTube: <a href="http://youtu.be/7BwmYBXCo-Y" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://youtu.be/7BwmYBXCo-Y</a><br><br>The "in-progress" stuff works itself out for me without having to tweak the system.  I select a list of items, mark them as "Do", and work through them backwards as much as I can.  EverNote handles the updates and the list for me.<br><br>Watch the video.  It makes it very easy.  No cheats or hacks over here.</div>
