<div class="content">I came back to FV after abandoning it for a reason I no longer remember. Thanks to this forum, I now have a better understanding of how to think about the first task and building the chain.<br><br>I like working on paper, but I have a tendency to forget my notebook at home when leaving for work, or vice versa, and need an electronic version that is available from any computer/device.<br><br>The purpose of this message is just to let everyone who might be interested know about Blanc List. It's free, and designed for FV. You can try it out here: https://www.blanclist.com/app/</div>

<div class="content">Yeah, I've used it and I really like it.  However, it needs some beefing up (ability to create home v. work lists, task notes, etc) for me to really incorporate it into my workflow.<br><br>I'm using Wunderlist at the moment and that works very well for FV.  Have it setup so that new tasks always appear at the top of the list (oldest is thus at the bottom).  To select a task for inclusion in the chain, star it (it floats to the top).  As I work I either check off the task if I complete it, or just remove the star if it still needs work.  It remains in the correct spot in my backlog of tasks.<br><br>For example:<br>Initial setup:<br>[ ] Task 5<br>[ ] Task 4<br>[ ] Task 3<br>[ ] Task 2<br>[ ] Task 1<br><br>I start my chain by starring tasks 1, 3, 5.  My list now looks like this:<br>[ ] Task 5 *<br>[ ] Task 3 *<br>[ ] Task 1 *<br>[ ] Task 4<br>[ ] Task 2<br><br>I go through my chain.  During this chain I complete task 5, do some work on tasks 3 and 1 and add tasks 6 and 7.  I now have this:<br>[ ] Task 7<br>[ ] Task 6<br>[ ] Task 3 <br>[ ] Task 1 <br>[ ] Task 4<br>[ ] Task 2<br><br>And I'm ready to make a new chain</div>

<div class="content">Another alternative (I'm using) is Nozbe - even if it was developed as an GTD tool. The basic version is free and offers (at least) apps for iPhone, iPad, Windows (program or browser). You find a bit more about it in my description of my FV variant: <a href="../fvp_forum/Variant of FV.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/fv-forum/post/2326401</a><br>(I'm not affiliated in any way with the Nozbe company)</div>

<div class="content">Make sure you check out the video avrum posted showing an Evernote FV implementation. It has a lot of advantages: tasks in the same place as your notes (if you use Evernote), syncs to all your devices, the process of selecting is easy and looks the same as paper (some other electronic implementations people use have to have the list backwards, and stuff like that). Oh, and you can write notes below your tasks where it may be helpful.<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BwmYBXCo-Y" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BwmYBXCo-Y</a><br><br>[Edited the link to make it work. You must delete the "s" from https: - MF]</div>

<div class="content">I've been using FV for a couple days and I like it a lot. I'm thinking of writing some custom software to do it, as a personal project, but there's tons of knowledge and experience scattered around the forum that's hard to find - definitely not just in the FV algorithm.<br><br>What do you guys think would be great/necessary in a software version?</div>

<div class="content">Easy re-add (for unfinished or repeating tasks)<br>Ability to exclude contexts (hide @home when I'm at work)<br><br>I am using WorkFlowy right now, and very happy with it.</div>

<div class="content">+1 for easy re-add for unfinished and repeating tasks. Also record a history of the task, or at least the date last done.<br><br>Recurring by calendar, and by last-done.<br><br>Record when done, not when ticked off. That often affects when a task recurs.</div>
