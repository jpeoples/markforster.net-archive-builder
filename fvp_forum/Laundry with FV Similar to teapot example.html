<div class="content">In the new FAQs tab, there is an example of making tea that illustrates how to use the system to handle a composite tasks where you can do other things while your tasks is in limbo, and come back to the tea when a timer goes off for the next step.<br><br>I just wanted to share a tip that others may find useful, albeit perhaps obvious. I have used the same process since FV came out to do laundry. If I do laundry on Saturday, then I put "laundry" on my list on Friday. On Saturday, it gets selected, and when I reach it, I start the laundry and set a timer. Then I cross "laundry" off my list and continue working. When the timer goes off, I add "laundry" to the end of my list, dot it, and go do the next step. Then I set a timer, cross the task off, and continue working. This continues until the laundry is done.<br><br>This is probably fairly obvious, but I just wanted to share it in case anyone has had trouble incorporating this kind of task into FV's rules.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Austin<br><br>I'll have to go back and re-read my original example (it's a long time since I wrote most of them). Do you mind if I add your tip?</div>
