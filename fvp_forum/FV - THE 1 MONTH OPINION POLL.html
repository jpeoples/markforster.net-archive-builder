<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2012-04-17 20:50</div>
<div class="content">FV has been out for just over a month now, and I wonder if it’s time for a quick-fire opinion poll?<br><br>I’m not up to scratch with every thread in this forum, but my sense is that virtually all contributors remain very positive. I’m aware this is only a reflection on those who choose to contribute to the forum, but let’s work with what we’ve got, rather than with what we haven’t.<br><br>Interestingly, I also sense that there is far less ‘tweaking’ going on by comparison to older MF systems (or perhaps people are simply being quieter about their tweaking?); and there also appears to be more ‘stickability’ with FV. Of course, there good be a range of variables for this – such as the fact that MF seems pretty intent on this being his last system (and for once I am convinced by this claim), so we might as well stick with it because we’re not going to be graced by a future upgrade. However, I’m hoping that the decrease in tweaking and the stickability is more a reflection of FV's genius and simplicity.<br><br>To make an opinion poll easily digestible, how about people respond with a several word answer to each of the following questions:<br><br>(1)	How long have you been using FV? (and if you’re no longer using FV, what are you using instead?)<br>(2)	Electronic or paper?<br>(3)	In what contexts do you use FV? (ie. at home, work, school, etc)<br>(4)	Any questions about FV?<br>(5)	Any dislikes about FV?<br>(6)	Any tweaks/tips? <br>(7)	Which aspect of FV do you find the hardest to stick to and why?<br>(8)	Final comment in 10 words or less<br><br>I’ve given my example in the post below. If interested, perhaps others can follow suit?</div>

<div class="content">1) About 1 month<br><br>2) paper (3x5 cards, lined, 18 tasks per page, vertical orientation, bound with Circa-like rings, reporter notebook style, with a plastic cover I cut out, including a pen loop)<br><br>3) all contexts in one list<br><br>4) I currently do not have any questions other than: When will the book come out? I will buy one.<br><br>5) I sometimes dislike that there is additional thought involved in making chains when I have to consider the structure of my day. For example, I might have a one-hour window of discretionary time involving 2 or 3 contexts, followed by 6 hours during which my time is already spoken for. It is helpful to consider these multiple factors while making the chain. It is much easier to use this system when I have more discretionary time.<br><br>6) The only tweak I use is to use magnetic page markers to point to the selected tasks. (This is in addition to the dots and the vertical and horizontal lines. It is very easy to find my chain).<br><br>7) The aspect hardest to stick to is finding the right balance in what it means to act on a task. It could be anything from "think about it" to "complete it." I tend to lean one way or another -- both extremes can create problems.<br><br>8) "The question" is very thoroughly thought out. Don't change wording!</div>

<div class="content">(1)	How long: 5 weeks<br>(2)	first 2 weeks on paper, then tried TaskPaper for a few days, now using EverNote for almost 3 weeks. I would like to go back to paper, which feels nicer, but in the end electronic is more efficient for my way of working with projects and notes.<br>(3)	contexts: home and work (i.e., everywhere), I use tags in Evernote to be able to separate them (although in practice I often just look at the entire list)<br>(4)	questions: still struggling how to get a good feel for what 'a days work' looks like in FV<br>(5)	dislike: scanning the list for making the preselection can be a bit of burden with a long list. Although I am getting better at it.<br>(6)	tip: Evernote works very nice to integrate FV with taking notes about projects.<br>(7)	hardest aspect: I have a tendency to scrap the preselection when switching context (home/work), meaning the early tasks stay around too long<br>(8)	I though DIT and AF were brilliant, but FV is much better</div>

Not getting distracted or going "off-list" (but less now that some "distractions" became part of the list)<br>(8)	Comments? The constant auto-review via the pre-selection scanning is brilliant! (to me it's the key that makes FV work so well, because it keeps you in tune with the list, and the list fresh and current, without cruft).</div>

<div class="content">(1)	FV since week one<br>(2)	Paper. A4 notebook <br>(3)	3 columns: Work; Personal; study<br>(4)	Tweak/tip.  I used one part of one of the older systems - when my list is too straggly ( i reached 12 a4 pages) I rewrite the early pages with 5 or less items on them and create a new page.  This page still functions as the "top of the list" so I always cycle back to it.  On the new page I first note the page it came off and then write the task.  <br>This may seem cumbersome, but it was better than struggling through to spot the last 2,3,4 or 5 items on my early pages in the list.  Equally I did not want to cross them out and put them into the list as that would collude with my own procrastination of those tasks which were not unimportant enough to drop off the list.</div>

<div class="content">(1) How long have you been using FV? (and if you’re no longer using FV, what are you using instead?) -- Since it was published -- a few days later, actually, since I wasn't asking the right question at first.<br><br>(2) Electronic or paper? -- Paper at first, but shifted to electronic a few days ago. I might shift back to paper after I've merged all my old lists, or combine paper for the list and electronic for notes. I still use paper to record things when the computer is turned off for the day (or not yet turned on).<br><br>(3) In what contexts do you use FV? (ie. at home, work, school, etc) -- I'm a stay-home Mom, so all. (I used to be an engineer in a foundry.)<br><br>(4) Any questions about FV? -- None at the moment.<br><br>(5) Any dislikes about FV? -- Currently I'm doing too much annual work and not enough daily. That's probably because I just imported a long-neglected list of high-resistance annual tasks and kept the original dates. Even though I choose only one annual task per cycle, I really want to get it done, so I don't want to do much before it. I end up with many short chains, each with just a few frequent tasks and an annual one.<br><br>(6) Any tweaks/tips?<br>I added "room of the day" and "outside work" lines, as well as a line per room and outside task and outside area. If I see a list of rooms, I won't want to work on any of them. If I see "room of the day", I will. When it comes up, I pick the room that stands out most (often the oldest) and then mark both lines as done. If the normal pre-selection question puts a room in the chain, I do it, and, if I haven't already done a room of the day, mark that line off too. Each room is getting attention on a regular basis now, something which hasn't happened in a long time.<br><br>To deal with balance issue mentioned earlier, I now insist that each chain include something that repeats somewhere between weekly and monthly, and something daily. Sometimes I declare that a few hours will have a focus.<br><br>(7) Which aspect of FV do you find the hardest to stick to and why?<br>Balancing the freedom with time-critical tasks, especially tasks that can be done any time but must be done by a deadline (such as chopping supper vegetables).<br><br>(8) Final comment in 10 words or less<br>It may not be the final answer, but it works for now.</div>

<div class="content">(1)	How long have you been using FV? (and if you’re no longer using FV, what are you using instead?)<br>(2)	Electronic.  Using Evernote.<br>(3)	Home and work<br>(4)	No questions<br>(5)	No dislikes<br>(6)	Not everything has to be broken down into 100 parts or even discrete steps.  The point (at least for me) is that important things are called to my attention.  Also, don't be afraid to delete things that are unrealistic.  Deleting things is liberating.<br>(7)	Love this system.  It is a more structured version of the way that I have always worked<br>(8)	Working on the task at the top of the list last is brilliant.</div>

Having some issue with urgency but I think I may have figured it out thanks to a recent post<br><br>(5)	Not really.  I would like to see some more ideas about dismissal but, to be honest, that's easy enough to work out on your own, right?<br><br>(6)	Tip - Most may do this but when I write my Chain list, I do so in a second column on the right of the page.  This is much like what was being in done in later versions of AF so I like it.<br><br>(7)	"Little and often."  Its a delicate balance between breaking an task down too far and not doing it enough.  <br><br>(8)	A simple and effective blend of intuition, organization and effectiveness.</div>

<div class="content">1) since it was launched<br>2) paper<br>3) work<br>4) Not at present<br>5) None<br>6) I am using a sheet of A3 with two columns for my list, which works well for me. I type the tasks in Word down the left hand column, print and then hand write new tasks. When I have filled the page I usually have at least 50% of the tasks complete, so I retype the list with the incomplete tasks and print out a new one. I started off using dots to mark taks but now I use a yellow highlighter as i find this easier.<br>7) Sometimes there is a temptation to jump the order of the list, if an item higher up it becomes more urgent. I have been dealing with new urgent tasks by temporarily putting the list to one side, doing the new task and going back to the list, which works well for me.<br>8) Best system I have ever used. Sticking with it.</div>

Implementing it with Evernote (which I have had but seldom used for years) is the icing on the cake.</div>

Home with micro-lists for procrastination-busting at work<br>(4) Any questions about FV? No<br>(5) Any dislikes about FV? I miss how well DWM allowed me to handle appointments and tickler items.  I could very clearly see them get closer as time went on.  This is important to me because I can and have said on the 20th that a task due on the 21st is "next week."  (Said while shopping with checks and writing the date at every store.)  I have to be more diligent about consulting the tickler items and checking my future appointments in my calendar now.<br>(6) Any tweaks/tips? Separate lists for routine household chores, with items rotated into the main list.<br>(7) Which aspect of FV do you find the hardest to stick to and why? Asking the right question.  I'm not sure why - ingrained AF habits?  I tend to pick things that stand out and get careless about the question.<br>(8) Final comment in 10 words or less: It's excellent.</div>

<div class="content"><<46% of those polled are using paper.>><br><br>My paper system has not crashed even once, the display is stunningly sharp, and it is compatible with attachments of all formats. It suffered no damage when I dropped it on the floor, and battery life seems to be indefinite. The pen did stop working once, but I was able to replace it for about a dollar.  ;D</div>

<div class="content">(1) How long have you been using FV? (and if you’re no longer using FV, what are you using instead?)<br>For about two weeks (started April 10)<br><br>(2) Electronic or paper?<br>Electronic. I use workflowy.com as the list tool, which is working pretty well.<br><br>(3) In what contexts do you use FV? (ie. at home, work, school, etc)<br>Work. I've tried using it at home a little, but I tend to enjoy being much less organized at home than I am at work.<br><br>(4) Any questions about FV?<br>How do I account for the amount of time available? I find myself sometimes choosing a slice of things to do, starting to attend to them, and then e.g. the work day ends without my having completed them all. When I pick up again, my "wanting to do" function often has changed. Should I redo the selection process then?<br><br>(5) Any dislikes about FV?<br>I've had a few items that are unpleasant and long to do that I keep punting to the end of the list, after moving them forward a little bit when forced to by the system. In a weird way, I feel like I have some incentive to keep my list full of other things so that I can keep the unpleasant but necessary things from coming up very often.<br><br>(6) Any tweaks/tips?<br>I use an email reminder service (nudgemail.com, there's others like it), as a way to move tasks to the future when they can't have anything more done on them in the present, and take them off the list in the meantime.<br><br>(7) Which aspect of FV do you find the hardest to stick to and why?<br>Picking items to do on the basis of priority as opposed to wanting to do more. I'm getting better at this, but I think this is mostly due to old habits from typical todo-list use.<br><br>(8) Final comment in 10 words or less<br>A surprisingly effective tool, especially given its simplicity.</div>
