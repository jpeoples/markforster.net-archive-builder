<div class="content">I think we've covered urgent tasks quite a bit here. Put it at the end of the list with a dot. Any tips for getting through the ones that are urgent with a great deal of resistance?</div>

<div class="content">Just get out the folder. It tricks your reactive brain into settling down -- just getting out the folder isn't that scary -- and lets your logical brain have some peace to work in.<br><br>Do it in several passes, each one deeper. Mark described this in his blog, using writing as an example (recreated from faulty memory here). First pass: get out the folder. 2nd pass: consider topics. 3rd pass: 1st level outline. 4th pass: flesh out the outline. 5th pass add a few sentences. Each pass is a bit longer, but only a small step from the previous.<br><br>If your brain grabs a juicy bit and wants to do more, let it.<br><br>Little and often. Small, not-scary chunks, with enough time between for your lizard brain to settle down and realize it wasn't so bad, but often enough to keep up momentum (and not long enough for your lizard brain to forget it wasn't so bad).<br><br>By lizard brain, I mean the primitive, fearful part of your brain. It's very good for keeping you out of dark, scary caves that might hold a sabre tooth tiger, but right now it's just getting in the way.</div>

<div class="content">I've only been using FV since last week, and I've already run into the problem Jim raised.  FV seems to be a great system, and I've made good progress on some long-neglected tasks, but high-resistance urgent tasks feel like a definite weak area.  Granted, I started with my existing list rather than starting a new list from scratch for FV, but that's because I want a system to be able to handle the load without having to use baby steps to ease into using it.<br><br>I have a particular task in mind that is on my list and I would classify it as urgent -- yet it's a high-resistance task.  Following the FV rules, a full week has gone by without this task getting preselected, because it's never been the answer to The Question, even though I know it SHOULD be done soon.  I've worked on many other tasks on my list, but this one won't be one that I actually WANT to do before something else -- at least not until the benchmark is a task with even higher resistance.<br><br>Cricket's advice is good, but irrelevant here.  Until the task ends up on the preselected list, you won't even "get out the folder" because you're NOT supposed to be working on the task yet.  And the longer the list is, the longer it will take to reach the magic slot where it becomes the first unactioned item and FV rules say that you MUST preselect it at that point.<br><br>Starting today, I am experimenting with a FV tweak to try to counter this.  For urgent tasks, I am adding a star (*) in front of the task to mark it as urgent.  For really urgent tasks (like the one I have in mind), I'm using two stars (**).  The only difference from normal FV rules is that I am keeping all starred tasks before main list of unstarred ones, and all double-starred tasks before the starred ones -- unless they're being immediately added to the preselected list when entered, in which case they are entered at the bottom of the main list and immediately preselected with a dot.  Preselection always starts with the first unactioned task in the highest-level group (double-starred, starred, unstarred) and continues through all the groups to the end of the list as in standard FV rules.<br><br>Since I am implementing FV on 3x5 index cards, I am simply keeping the starred and double-starred tasks on separate cards and keeping those cards earlier in the sequence.  When rewriting an urgent task, I write it on the last card of the group it belongs in.  At the moment, I have 1 card with double-starred tasks, 3 cards with starred tasks and 6 cards with unstarred tasks.<br><br>My thinking is that this tweak will force urgent tasks to flow into the magic first slot sooner and more frequently to ensure high-resistance urgent tasks benefit from the little-and-often principle and don't languish.  All I'm really doing is changing the rewriting rule slightly to insert urgent tasks after other similarly-urgent tasks at the top of the full list instead of rewriting everything at the end of the list as in standard FV.<br><br>Mark, what are your thoughts about this tweak?  Do you see a better way to handle high-resistance urgent tasks within the standard FV rules?</div>

<div class="content">I've got a high-resistance urgent task sitting at my elbow right now.  It may not be the kind of task Deven has in mind because it isn't a huge scary bugbear.  It's a tedious, normal part of my workday and today I just don't want to do it.  It has to be done.  It is the reason my job position exists.  I can sort of delegate (I can ask for volunteers to help), but I still have to do my share of the work and I really don't have the justification for asking for help today.  I'm not swamped, I'm apathetic.  Though if I don't break the apathy soon I'll fall behind and be swamped...<br><br>So I'm working a work-based FV list and hitting it on every single ladder.  I've done three ladders since lunch, of about three or four tasks each.  The dreaded task, a more neutral work task, working my personal FV list, and/or goofing off online.  I'm not making quick progress on the dreaded task, but it is vanishing and every pass through the chain I work on it a bit longer before turning aside from it.<br><br>For me, a strong enough "I should work on that" can turn a dreaded task into a want to do, if only so I can eat the spinach and move on to dessert.</div>

<div class="content">Aren't y'all over-thinking this? If something is urgent (by your own reckoning), then you want to get it done. If it's really urgent, then you want to get it done before other things.<br><br>Perhaps rephrasing the Question to "What do I want to get done, before I get X done?" will help.  While almost the same as the original, the emphasis is on having it done rather than on the doing. You can still just do just a little bit of it and reenter it, and then it may still need to be preselected on the next chain if the urgency remains.<br><br>Consider that the 'want' in the original question should not be construed so as to get you to select only easy or fun tasks. You 'want' to be professional, responsible, accountable, and have peace of mind that you are taking action on everything that is important and urgent in your life.</div>

<div class="content">Devon, that sounds worth trying. I'm making great progress on my ancient low-priority (and therefore low want -- except they're all part of a very nice and acheivable Future Reality) items, but at the expense of today's urgent items. The only difference is the order, right? You still read the entire list while pre-selecting? Do you find that the oldest unstarred item gets neglected? That's still a magic spot for me.<br><br>I wonder if, once my backlog of low-priority but important to my Future Reality tasks clears out, the problem will still exist.<br><br>R.M. So the dreaded task is permanently dotted? That makes sense. Does it still get rewritten to the bottom, with the permanent dot attached, each time you do it?</div>

<div class="content">Really, the only functional change I'm making is in the rewriting rule.  Instead of always rewriting all tasks at the end of the full list (which means they will take the longest possible time to reach the magic slot at the top), I'm inserting the urgent tasks closer to the top of the list (at the end of the possibly-empty group of tasks with the same number of stars) to guarantee that they cycle more frequently.  I am NOT changing the question or the preselection process at all, only the rewriting procedure.<br><br>Of course, inserting into the middle of a list is tricky in a paper notebook, though a loose-leaf notebook could be managed the way I'm using index cards.  I just happen to like index cards.  My tweaked rewriting rule would be quite simple to implement electronically, of course.<br><br>I realize this change will mean that old unstarred tasks are more likely to be neglected, but I don't see that as a downside.  They're old because they've been neglected already, and if I'm going to have a system force one task to be a priority (by being the root of a chain), I'd rather it be an urgent item.  When I run out of urgent tasks, this tweaked version of FV will naturally resume paring down the neglected unstarred tasks, without leaving urgent tasks to languish.</div>

<div class="content">In response to ubi, I can agree that I "should" work on the high-resistance urgent task, or that I "need" to, but I'd be lying to myself to say that I "want" to.  That strikes me as gaming the system to achieve the desired outcome, but you're sacrificing the true psychological readiness goal of The Question as Mark formulated it.  Rather than twisting the definition of "want" to force an urgent item into the chain, I think it's better to tweak the rewriting rule to make it keep appearing at the top of the list, where things you DON'T want to do are used to start a new chain.  That way, you can get the full benefit of the laddering effect of the chain to work your way up to doing something you don't really want to do, which should lead to less resistance than forcing yourself to define "want" so as to include anything urgent in the chain when you don't really want to do it before X...</div>

<div class="content">maybe I'm missing something, but if by 'magic slot' you mean it's an item that gets picked every chain, can't you do that by re-writing the item at the bottom and dotting it each time you make a chain? No tweaks?</div>
<h2>Reply by ubi</h2>
<div class="meta">2012-04-20 20:52</div>
<div class="content">Deven, <br><br>I don't think my suggestion above twists the meaning of 'want' in the original question. As Mark says in the FV instructions: <<What exactly is meant by "want" in this context is deliberately left undefined. There may be a whole variety of reasons why you might want to do one thing before another thing and all of them are valid.>><br><br>Since the task is on your list, I assume it's something that is important to you. Further, you've identified the task as both high-resistance (i.e. unpleasant and/or difficult) and urgent. You want it done, or at least gone and off your list, right? What will happen if you just delete it or try to delegate it to someone else or just keep skipping it and letting the deadline pass?  Do you 'want' to let any of those things happen?  If not, then I submit that you really truly 'want' to get it done.</div>

No tweaks? >><br><br>The "magic slot" is the first item in the list, because the FV rules require the first unactioned item to be the root of the chain in the preselection process.  What's magic about this is that you're including it on your list whether you want to do it or not.  Everything else is supposed to be selected on the basis of The Question ("What do I want to do before I do x?") to create the chain of tasks to do in sequence, generating a laddering effect to work your way up to the task you perhaps didn't even want to do in the first place.<br><br>High-resistance urgent tasks will rarely be selected by The Question, yet are exactly the tasks most in need of this laddering treatment and the little-and-often effect.  That's why my tweak is to change the rewriting rule to insert the urgent items near the top of the list where they will flow into that "magic slot" sooner and more often.<br><br>Your suggestion *is* a tweak, because you're changing The Question without even realizing it.  By rewriting the urgent item at the bottom of the list and dotting it each time you make a chain, you're changing the question to "What do I want to do before I do x, or is urgent?"  That's a much more substantial tweak than the one I am proposing, because you're potentially sacrificing the laddering effect and encouraging resistance against the task AND the system.  I think the explicit tweak to the rewriting rule is better.</div>

<div class="content">"So the dreaded task is permanently dotted? That makes sense. Does it still get rewritten to the bottom, with the permanent dot attached, each time you do it?"<br><br>Yes Cricket, that's exactly it - it is permanently dotted.  I do recopy it to the end every time.  I get a boost of accomplishment from striking it out even if I re-add it at the end.  I think I'd get resistance if I tried to create a really regular cycle of three or four tasks or if I tried to remember where in a list the dreaded task fell.  "Was it before or after the filing?  I'll do it after."  I also want to work the FV list by the rules for the practice of working  the list by the rules, to reinforce that habit since that's my biggest problem when I'm at home. <br><br>The dreaded task is at this point done - it wasn't huge, just an hour or two or work.  Now I'm doing other tasks, including an identical task on a project with less resistance.  The FV list is less critical now.  Before I needed it to force myself to do the work.  Now I just need it to keep me from being too generous with my fun breaks.</div>

<div class="content">ubi:<br><br>I realize that Mark left the definition of "want" deliberately vague, but the fact remains that I don't really want to do this task.  I need to do it because it's my job and it's not reasonable to delegate it.  Yes, I could technically remain within the FV rules by defining "want" as you describe, since Mark left if vague.  However, it's more honest to say that you're tweaking the FV rules by doing this, because you're really changing The Question to "What do I want to do before I do x, or feel like I have to do even though I don't want to?"  Again, I think this has the same problem as Lillian's approach.</div>

However, doing so implies that you WANT to do it before whatever you're currently working on, because that's the criteria embedded in The Question.  I'm trying to address the handling of urgent items that you DON'T want to do before the other tasks that are available.</div>

<div class="content">I agree that I'm doing exactly what Lillian suggested.  I almost decided not to post since she'd covered what I was going to say.  I suppose I could be tweaking the question, though you're right, I really don't feel like I am.  I want this to be finished, therefore I want to do it soon even though I don't want to do it at all.  It is a question of which want counts the most.<br><br>What's funny to me is that permanently dotting the item and leaving it at the top gives me the hives just to think about it.  Instant stuck.  Permanently dotting it and re-adding it to the bottom of every chain makes me feel like I'm accomplishing something and I fly through the rotations.  It makes no sense, but there it is.  I'll stick to the one that doesn't make me flee the list in terror. :)</div>

<div class="content">um, I'm confused, but if the urgent task can sit on the list without any work on it for a week(?!),  how urgent is it really? (For me, urgent is 'drop everything and do only this NOW until it's done' )</div>

<div class="content">The constant cycling through the list (every time you do a preselection round) tends to break down resistance.   At least, that's my experience.   <br><br>I might skip that high-resistance item for a few cycles, but the resistance slowly breaks down as my subconscious mind ponders the implications of my procrastination.  Finally I cry out, "enough already!" and "pull out the file".    That's usually enough to get me started on serious work, and sometimes just to get the thing done in one go.<br><br>If that DOESN'T happen, I have found that the task really wasn't that important anyway (almost always).   It just goes stale and loses its urgency.<br><br>Actually, it's not "almost always".   It's just "always".    At least, so far.   :-)<br><br>And that's exactly what is SUPPOSED to happen.   FV is designed to sort out the REALLY urgent from the FAUX urgent.   :-)</div>

<div class="content"><< What's funny to me is that permanently dotting the item and leaving it at the top gives me the hives just to think about it. >><br><br>I'm not talking about permanently dotting anything, that's your approach.  I'm talking about rewriting urgent tasks NEAR the top to give them extra priority to match the urgency without changing The Question or how to work the chains.<br><br>Perhaps an example would help illustrate what I mean.  Suppose you have the following list:<br><br>Task A<br>Task B<br>Task C<br>Task D<br>Task E<br>Task F<br>Task G<br><br>Suppose you preselect the following chain: A-C-F, and decide during the preselection process that Task C is urgent, so you mark it with a star.  (I'll use hyphens below to represent dotted tasks that have been preselected.)  You now have the following list:<br><br>-Task A<br>Task B<br>-*Task C<br>Task D<br>Task E<br>-Task F<br>Task G<br><br>You action Task F and rewrite it:<br><br>-Task A<br>Task B<br>-*Task C<br>Task D<br>Task E<br>Task G<br>Task F<br><br>Following your preselection, you action Task C next, and rewrite it at the top because you don't have any starred tasks yet:<br><br>*Task C<br>-Task A<br>Task B<br>Task D<br>Task E<br>Task G<br>Task F<br><br>Finally, you action Task A, finishing your initial chain.  Suppose you're finished with this one, so you delete it:<br><br>*Task C<br>Task B<br>Task D<br>Task E<br>Task G<br>Task F<br><br>You start preselecting a new chain.  The urgent task (Task C) is now automatically included as the root of the new chain.  Suppose you select C-E-G as the new chain:<br><br>-*Task C<br>Task B<br>Task D<br>-Task E<br>-Task G<br>Task F<br><br>While working on Task G, a new Task H comes in.  It's urgent and you want to work on it right away, so (following the FV rules), you add it to the end of the list, preselect it immediately and start working on it:<br><br>-*Task C<br>Task B<br>Task D<br>-Task E<br>-Task G<br>Task F<br>-*Task H<br><br>After actioning Task H, it's not done, so you rewrite it at the end of the list of starred tasks:<br><br>-*Task C<br>*Task H<br>Task B<br>Task D<br>-Task E<br>-Task G<br>Task F<br><br>Following your preselection, you resume working on Task G after the interruption of Task H.  You finish this task and delete it from the list:<br><br>-*Task C<br>*Task H<br>Task B<br>Task D<br>-Task E<br>Task F<br><br>Following your preselection, you action Task E and rewrite it:<br><br>-*Task C<br>*Task H<br>Task B<br>Task D<br>Task F<br>Task E<br><br>Following your preselection, you action Task C and rewrite it at the end of the list of starred tasks:<br><br>*Task H<br>*Task C<br>Task B<br>Task D<br>Task F<br>Task E<br><br>You then start a new chain, this time with Task H as the root of the chain.  Notice that Task C is NOT "permanently dotted", because this chain won't include Task C unless it's something you WANT to do before Task H.  (Remember, I am not changing The Question.)  However, once you finish the chain with Task H, the next chain will start with Task C again.<br><br>The idea of this tweak is to make urgent items appear in the "magic slot" in preference to low-priority neglected items.  While those neglected items may be deserving of attention, it's probably more important to work on the urgent items first.  This tweak is designed to give urgent items the maximum benefit of the laddering effect from The Question without needing to bend the definition of "want" or "permanently dot" anything.</div>

<div class="content">deven @20 april 20,17 >>That really the same thing that Lillian proposed, and I think it effectively amounts to tweaking The Question>><br><br>?? I didn't intend to say anything that was a tweak to FV. Dotting the same urgent/high priority item each time (or most times) a chain is created, no matter where it is on the list, isn't a tweak. If it's urgent/high priority it should come up as a 'want to do before' something else on the list ~because~ it's urgent/high priority. It's in the FV rules that urgent tasks that come up during the day are added to the end of the list with a dot.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>The problem is not with FV or any of your ideas. The problem is with me. I just can't follow any algorithms consistently. I keep forgetting I even have a list sitting in front of my nose. When I remember to look at the list, I have a very high resistance of even reading it, except very early in the morning. The list is really a place to keep reminders of things that need to be done since  my memory is not that great.<br><br>When I say that I follow mostly AF1, it's because it was the first of your systems that I tried really hard to implement, even if in my own way.  Then I also liked DWM but probably because it divided the long list into several chunks, which were easier to read for me. The one thing that   took from FV is the permission to either work on the first task on the list or rewrite it at the end of the list if the task is not ready, which gives me the feeling that I'm moving down the list. And it is a nice feeling.<br><br>But I don't want to search on many pages for tasks that need to be done before the others. I like the idea of having the urgent list (two stars) less urgent (one star) and not urgent and work them all at their right pace but knowing were to check first for what is more important.</div>

<div class="content">I've been working with a lengthy high-resistance task (marking projects) for the past couple of week, which was becoming urgent due to a deadline. I processed it in accordance with FV rules, and found that although I selected the task each time I built a chain, I wasn't getting through the work quickly enough. I would do some of the work, decide that was enough for now, and rewrite it at the bottom, and moved onto something more interesting in my list.<br><br>I finally shifted it by writing it at the end of the list with a dot, and with the wording 'Finish project marking' and didn't allow myself to move onto anything else until it was done. Not ideal, but the looming deadline trumped everything.<br><br>On other occasions I've dealt with this kind of high resistance task by breaking it down into discrete parts (e.g. mark 2 projects) and doing one part every day until completed. Non-negotiable, I have to do it, even if if means starting at 11pm. Better to do it first thing in the day if I can, like Mark's Current Initiative.</div>

However, I also need to define how 'little or much' to do along the path of a bigger task, like the report I am trying to finish this weekend!<br><br>When an urgent/important task is being added to the end of the list, perhaps the dot needs to be enhanced to make it stand out even more, due to its relative urgency/importancy.

<div class="content">Deven:<br><br><< <br>I find it confusing that you stated that "What is more urgent than x?" was a much less effective question for you than "What do I want to do before I do x?", yet you recommend treating the latter question as if it were the former when the problem of urgency arises.  I realize that leaving "want" undefined technically allows this within the rules, but won't you lose the effectiveness of the refined question by doing so? >><br><br>The whole point of the question is that there may be many reasons why one would want to do one task before another. Urgency may be one of those.<br><br>"I want to do this before I do that" is the not the same as saying "I want to do this more than I want to do that".</div>

<div class="content">I have used the star system for a couple of days and loved it from the first moment.  In effect I have three lists assembled by priority really:<br><br>(1) Priority 1 or two stars: everything to do with important external issues usually with a deadline.  Work tasks, appointments, projects with deadlines. like tax and bill payments, waiting  for items.<br><br>(2) Priority 2 or one star: routine tasks, both maintenance and projects without deadlines that I'm committed to either do daily or finish as soon as possible.<br><br>(3) Priority 3 or no star: everything else that would be nice to do sooner or later.<br><br>The amazing effect is that:<br><br>(1) I have no problem deciding which task goes on which list unlike assigning priorities to tasks on already existing random list, which created extreme resistance.<br><br>(2) I remember each list including order of tasks on each list so I don't need to read the lists through the day,  Morning review is enough to create a mental plan for the day and then I consult the list when I feel like my brain needs a momentary crutch or I have time or need to write or rewrite something.  Usually only few times a day.<br><br>It have always known that I can easily memorize categorized information and that I am completely hopeless in face of random facts. Somehow, I could never apply this in practice to organize my tasks into meaningful categories. I think the problem was with having too many or too narrow categories. That's why GTD wasn't very effective but any system with one long list was even more frustrating. There is a power in number three after all and thanks to the global suggestions on this forum I may have my own final version after all.</div>

<div class="content">Deven:<br><br><< I realize that Mark left the definition of "want" deliberately vague, but the fact remains that I don't really want to do this task. I need to do it because it's my job and it's not reasonable to delegate it. Yes, I could technically remain within the FV rules by defining "want" as you describe, since Mark left if vague. However, it's more honest to say that you're tweaking the FV rules by doing this, because you're really changing The Question to "What do I want to do before I do x, or feel like I have to do even though I don't want to? >><br><br>Starring a task is just a way of saying "I want to get this task done before the tasks that don't have stars".<br><br>To be absolutely clear: the question "What do I want to do before I do x" does not imply that you have to want to do the task in itself. All it means is that you want the tasks to be in a certain order. There may be any number of reasons why you want that order, which may include urgency, fear of consequences, desire to get something out of the way, feeling that you have to do it, etc. All these are perfectly legitimate reasons.<br><br>"What do I want to do before I do x, or feel like I have to do even though I don't want to?" is incorrect. It is properly phrased:<br><br>"I want to do y before x because I have to get it done".<br><br>To give the question the meaning that you have to want to do the task in itself is not correct and is not following the rules. To define "want" in the way I have outlined is not "technically within the rules" - it is the rules.</div>

They can be very effective over a short period but tend to break down because one tends only ever to get half way down priority B.</div>

<div class="content">Devon:<br><I currently have 7 double-starred tasks, 14 starred tasks and 27 unstarred tasks. Would you really suggest that I should decide to select all 21 of those starred/double-starred tasks in every chain?><br><br>If half your list is urgent then there is a problem with your definition of urgency. If everything (or too much) is urgent, then nothing is urgent.  My suggestion would be that unless it's an emergency (drop everything and put out the fire), just drop the tweaks and work the list per the rules.  Answer the right question (what do I want to do before 'X'?) and then work the resulting chain.  Creating the chain is all about sequencing; don't think too hard about it.  When you get on a roll, just keep going.  Focus on little and often: when you're ready to move on, cross off the item and reenter it at the end even if all you did was get out the folder.  Next task.<br><br>You have a relatively short list.  You almost can't help but make progress and eventually some of that progress will be those "urgent" items.  Maybe even before they become the first item on the ladder.</div>
