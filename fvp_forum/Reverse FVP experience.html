<div class="content">As I said in another post, I use reverse FVP currently. This means that after completing any task (task A, say), I need to compare the next selected task with all the tasks in the list above task A and perhaps select one of these. Potentially this could be very many comparisons.<br><br>I've complained on these forums, in connection with other systems of Mark's, about the length of my lists and the burden of over-many comparisons. Nevertheless, I've bitten the bullet with rFVP. I'm finding it a novel experience, and a good one, to review the whole list repeatedly. With FVP, the upper and older parts of my list would grow cobwebs.<br><br>There are two things I do in rFVP that reduce the number of comparisons I have to make. <br><br>First, I insert urgent or otherwise pressing tasks at the top of the list (suggested by Mark at <a href="../fvp_forum/Reverse FVP.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/fv-forum/post/2563635</a> ). When I know that such items are there, I just skim rapidly from task A to the top. <br><br>Second, at the beginning of a month I do a bulk clear-out of items from the previous month but one (at the beginning of February I shall clear out tasks entered before January 1). "Clearing out" means deleting, actioning or re-entering at the end of the list.</div>
