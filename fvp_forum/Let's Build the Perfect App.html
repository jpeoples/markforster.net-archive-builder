<div class="content">I believe the following features will need to be present in an app to win over the most people:<br><br>• Runs on iPhone, iPad, All Android Devices, Macs, and PCs from the moment it's released<br>• Flawless syncing between all of the above systems and devices from the moment it's released<br>• Keyboard shortcuts when running on a Mac or PC<br>• Notes for each task<br>• Clean visual design with plenty of white space<br>• Dotting of a task takes one tap<br>• Re-writing a task at the end takes one tap, beating paper<br>• Tasks (with notes) are importable and exportable as text<br>• Lists can be texted or emailed<br>• Access to the top and bottom of the list takes one tap<br>• Lists are searchable<br>• Can flag tasks but without using clipart-like tacky-looking flags and stars<br>• Can add contexts and filter by them<br>• Can set a reminder for a task and not see the task in the list until it's ready to be actioned<br>• Can set complex recurring-reminders for tasks, and when that task is completed it is hidden from the list until it next needs actioning<br>• Entering a task takes one tap<br>• A long string of tasks in text form can be pasted into a list and result in separate tasks<br>• Can re-order tasks with one tap<br>• Can have multiple lists<br>• Can move tasks between lists with a few taps<br>• Can search for text within a list and from the search results make a pre-selection and check-off tasks<br>• No checkboxes or checkmarks<br>• Beautiful font choice like Helvetica<br>• Quick startup<br>• Fast opening lists<br>• Undo deleting of tasks or lists<br>• Tasks can be greyed-out or dimmed when putting off or waiting for<br>• Completed tasks can be archived<br>• Sublists for projects, multi-step tasks, and routine checklists<br>• Resettable checklists for packing lists, routines, and workflows<br>• A sense of play to the app, tactile<br><br>I'd like to build a comprehensive list of features others are looking for, because an app developer would have a hard time building an app for us when we haven't all clearly defined the minimum feature set and design we're looking for. <br><br>Can anyone add to the above?<br><br>Perhaps we can build our dream app here in the forum, and using a cross-section of our desires solicit help from someone who would like to profit from them.</div>

<div class="content">Seems like an interesting project.  The first, and most important, step will be to rationalise the requirements, pare them down to the essentials (possibly with a roadmap for inclusion of future requirements) and then build a mockup.<br><br>For building the mockup, I would suggest Balsamiq which has a web demo version available here: <a href="http://builds.balsamiq.com/b/mockups-web-demo/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://builds.balsamiq.com/b/mockups-web-demo/</a><br><br>For this to be a viable project, I think it needs to be useable without FV so that it appeals to a wider audience.</div>

<div class="content">A setting in the app would allow the date to automatically be added to the front of the task when initially adding the task and at the end of the task when it's checked off — and both dates would travel with the task when it's exported as text out of the app.<br><br>And of course, new, re-entered, and moved tasks are all entered at the end of the list, with a toggle in the app settings that switches this to the top of the list.</div>

<div class="content">I wonder if a consensus is even possible with this project. It's certainly a tall order to fit all these features in, and keep a clean interface. At some point you run into either too much visual clutter or too much gestural conflation.  At some point you need to say this app will be biased in favour of this kind of action.  <br><br>For two points of contention:<br>Not every user wants things to move to the top or bottom only.  Settings can vastly complicate a program.<br><br>Anyway, I'd think tap to select/highlight an item.  Tap more to select more.  Action buttons for what is selected.  Gestures for the most fundamental actions.</div>

<div class="content">I don't think an app too tightly coupled with a particular workflow, with settings for this and that, will ever work broadly or generate consensus. It can certainly be perfect for a few (think "MeWare"[1] type of apps) but not many.<br><br>I do think however that there is room for an app that has "very powerful manipulation tools" of "large quantities of list items", which can then be applied to several types of workflows.<br><br>Focusing on the key building blocks of list manipulation and letting it be flexible in the way it's used (think flexible "Spreadsheets" vs rigid "Access Forms")… There's a very interesting post by Joel Spolsky[2] regarding the power of this type of generic data structures, when he talks about their Trello web app.<br><br>-- <br>Hugo<br><br>[1] <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/02/usware-vs-themware.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/02/usware-vs-themware.html</a><br>[2] <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2012/01/06.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2012/01/06.html</a></div>

<div class="content">Entirely right, Hugo.  I bet someone could get far with an iPhone app that's just lists if they put the right simple UI on it.  <br><br>Maybe for example like swipe left/right to go to next/previous list.  Swipe up/down to scroll list.  Tap top/bottom to go to top or bottom.  Tap item to select.  Drag it left/right/up/down/top/bottom to move it.  Double-tap for details.  But I emphasize it's only an example.  It takes a lot of brainstorming to really make an interface idea fly.</div>

<div class="content">"Let's not edit our ideas."  Good thought.<br><br>"Could an FV app be designed using HTML5 with fast start-up and operation, full offline use, a simple, beautiful, gesture driven interface, and an extensive in-app settings panel?"<br><br>Quite possibly.

Avoiding details of how you use it, what should the feel be?  Me I'd want something that is (1) Ultra-fast UI for the basic operations (2) Simple (3) Uncluttered (4) flexible use, not dictating the process. (5) easy data exchange<br><br>Do you agree?  Is there anything equally basic I missed?</div>

<div class="content">What I was trying to get at earlier is for something flexible enough to prototype ideas, then it should be possible to have AF, FV, Kanban, GTD, tickler lists, whatever. <br><br>Seems all Marks systems have originated using paper, Kanban originated using a whiteboard, would having that flexibility in an app enable different systems to come about?</div>

<div class="content">Full disclosure: I am the author of FocusPad, an iOS app that was designed to work well with the original Autofocus method, but that works surprisingly well for FV. I have no desire to hijack this thread with any self-promotion, but when I look at the list of desired features in the first post, I was surprised to see how many of these features FocusPad already has. What is does not have is a Mac or Windows version, which for many people is understandably a deal breaker. On the other hand, it does have a Web version with fast syncing. Another issue is that it has a very utilitarian look, which seemed very "clean" when it came out, but is starting to feel a tad dated now.<br><br>So I guess my question is this: how far is FocusPad from the "ideal" app? If it were only a few changes away, that would be ample motivation for me to revise and update it :-)</div>

<div class="meta">2012-06-27 17:09</div>
<div class="content">Tony<br>Focus pad is my favorite app but it is far from the ideal app.  I looked through the first post list you are referring to and FocusPad misses many of the points. <br><br>I won't list all but here are a few:<br>• Tasks (with notes) are importable and exportable as text<br>• Lists can be texted or emailed<br>-Listed aren't searchable on the mobile app. <br>-contexts/filters!<br>-sublists etc. <br><br>Overall it is definitely the best app for autofocus.  However, there haven't been updates for a long time. I believe there was a transition of authors and the last one didn't do any updates when superfocus came out even though they were promised. <br><br>FV is out and I believe the only update was to improve the graphics of the app. I could be wrong. But basically I haven't seen any significant difference to account for FV.  Yes, I can highlight to preselect and swipe backwards but his is cumbersome. And it is an ad hoc method I came up with on my own to settle with the lack of a more efficient method like filtering the chain. <br><br>The updates are very rare and the last review is from Nov 14 2010. <br><br>I'm not a developer so I'm certain that I am greatly underestimating the complexity and time of adding features. But it seems it's been very long compared to other apps updates.  I have received more updates from Clear and that came out probably 5 months ago. even Blanclist has given more significant updates in the right direction and it's  pretty new to the scene as well. <br><br>Many features from the Focuspad/FV post have been requested and I'm not certain what's the status, or what is the timeline.  <br><br>So to answer your question, from a customers perspective and someone who has faith in this app, Focuspad is very far from an ideal app. Many apps offer the feature FP doesn't have (ex. Toodledo, clear, BlancList etc) and they have frequent updates, and they respond more to feedback. <br>Example: BlancList author doesn't quite have the perfect app, but I've corresponded and there was work done in the right direction.  Little improvements here and there have been great. <br><br>The changes from autofocus to FV are few but still require some updating to the app. Many features have already been requested in the FP/FV thread along with feedback. That should be enough to motivate you and update. :)<br><br>What is the next 1 single feature at the top of your list? And ballpark estimate, when should it be in the AppStore as an update?</div>

<div class="content">Tony,<br><br>Thanks for replying on this forum. You asked: "how far is FocusPad from the 'ideal' app?"<br><br>For FV, it's not far from ideal. For me, a native Mac app and rock-solid syncing between the Mac and iOS versions would get me to try it again. It would be great if the Mac app was a small window that looked identical to the iOS version on the iPhone's screen. Not sure how much work that would be.<br><br>The two things I like about FP are (1) the ability to enter new items quickly on the desktop (via the browser) and (2) the similarity to a paged written notebook (with everything staying in its place). <br><br>But I found that the browser-based sync was often very slow and occasionally broken, so I have given up using FP for now.  Sorry, but if page reloads don't happen swiftly, or I get a broken display (double entries, quota-exceeded error), or if the iOS app contents don't match the web contents, then I cannot trust this system.</div>

<div class="content">I just started using the accomplist and it does indeed have most of the features of the 'ideal app' . I did speak to the developers , and they are going to be releasing versions across all platform soon.  It's probably the best organiser I have used so far. It's very simple to use and has quite a few sophisticated features like tagging , bulk operations , filtering and something called smart tagging which u find to be a simply brilliant concept. Implementation of fv using accomplist is really good and simple. Plus it's not just limited to FV , one can implement different task management techniques using it. Thank you naim for suggesting it . I would reccommend it to any one who wants to be more organised.</div>

<div class="content">Grik,<br><br>In other words, you want a split view, so (for example) you can see the "blue" tasks at the same you see the non-blue tasks, and have them be separately paged. It is an intriguing request, but this would be a major change to the UI, so don't expect it any time soon.

<div class="content">I am a big fan of FocusPad!<br><br>Tony, it does seem that people want tagging, searching, and filtering. Currently, the app has tagging and filtering of pages via the filled/empty diamond system, but only for pages and not tasks, so that is clearly necessary. <br><br>To Michael B.'s points<br><br>> • A setting to use every list as an endless-scrolling-list<br><br>Currently, FocusPad is an 'endless' list, but with a UI that requires advancing the list by swiping pages sideways. Is this a request to have the list scroll up/down so it doesn't seem to have a 'pages' metaphor? I just think of it as an endless list and ignore the 'page breaks'. Or is the issue that you want a better task filter that filters by task rather than by page? Would you be ok with the current set-up but a better task filter that only shows the tasks by currently selected by the filter. You can get to the top/bottom of the list very quickly with the slider at the bottom; no need to go page-by-page.<br><br>Personally, I like the current setup because I don't want to have to pay attention to how far I am scrolling to make sure I don't miss any tasks. The current set-up makes that easy.<br><br>> • Making the blue text color a readable shade of green instead. Blue is not readily associated with action, though red (for "urgent", "now", "stop", or "wait") and green (for "go", "ready", "active", or "today") are.<br><br>Ideally, the user could pick the 5 colors they wanted to have (I like blue, but I totally get your point)<br><br>> Your time is valuable and you should be paid for your development efforts. A PayPal donation button added to your website would allow current owners of the app to support your development efforts (and Apple doesn't get 30% of that!).<br><br>Another idea is a very small kickstarter.com campaign. I'd be more likely to donate if I felt that the total donations would be enough to give the developer enough time/incentime to complete the changes needed.<br><br>For me, the key thing is BUG FIXES on the iPhone (I don't really use the web app)<br><br>Right now, the app is showing me the to-do list, but it says 'Pads' where it should say 'to-do', the button on the top left says 'edit' with no arrow shape, and no button on the right. I can't figure out how to get to my list of pads, Killing the process and restarting fixes the problem and now it says 'to-do' at the top. I have problems like this probably once a week, where I have to kill the process.<br><br>Sync must be fixed. My sync to the web doesn't work very quickly or reliably. You should have a SYNC NOW button so I know it is at least trying to sync. I have had the web page open for a while, with the iPhone settings slider to the left, and it has not updated, and I have restarted, etc.<br><br>You should have a TEST SYNC button in settings that checks whether the app can successfully log in to Google and sync so that I can test the sync without a computer.<br><br>There are a number of UI improvements that would make the app better, especially with the tickler, but I'll save that until I see that you're picking up the project again on an ongoing basis.<br><br>Thanks for FocusPad!</div>

<div class="content">Jonathan:<br><br>"Would you be ok with the current set-up but a better task filter that only shows the tasks by currently selected by the filter."<br><br>... No. But I would like everyone to have access to the pages style as a setting that can be toggled on or off.<br><br><br>"You can get to the top/bottom of the list very quickly with the slider at the bottom; no need to go page-by-page."<br><br>... The problem isn't getting to the beginning or end of one's list quickly using the pages style. That's only a problem for an endless-scrolling list. The problem with the pages style of FocusPad and FV is that scanning a large list of tasks from beginning to end multiple times a day, page-by-page, in a tiny visual-window is tedious and is not as natural or easy to do one-handed. Scrolling long top-to-bottom lists can be done one-handed with your thumb, or, holding the device in your left hand (assuming you're right-handed), you can flick the screen up or down with your right index finger using the natural up or down bend of your finger. It's exactly why I think Apple should add the option to "page" through your iOS device apps from top to bottom instead of left to right. It's far less fatiguing to the hand.</div>

<div class="content">I just submitted an update to Apple with the following changes:<br><br>* Search for a task. There is a new search bar in the Pads view. <br>* Show only tasks marked blue or red. Select the special new "Blue" or "Red" pad.<br><br>Before I respond to the recent posts, I want to let you know that there is a FocusPad mailing list. That would be a better place to post your bug reports and suggested tweaks, so we don't waste the time of folks not using the app. As for the larger feature requests, posting them here might still be appropriate, as it will continue to stir the conversation about what would make a great FV app. The mailing list is at:<br><br><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/focuspad" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://groups.google.com/group/focuspad</a><br><br>To quickly summarize and respond to recent posts:<br><br>* I added "endless page" to my request list. This should not be very hard to do, since "long" pages are already supported. I like the idea, as it would make the app more broadly appealing to folks who don't like the page-based approach.  The feature would include the standard tapping of the status bar to scroll to top. Not sure about scroll to bottom.<br><br>* I added "choose colors for highlights" to my request list. <br><br>* Jonathan, please find me on the FocusPad mailing list so I can work with you to resolve your issues. A few other people have had the same issue as you regarding the Pads view, but I have so far been unable to reproduce it myself. Perhaps together we can find and slay this bug once and for all.<br><br>* Jonathan, I spent a lot of time making syncing fast and reliable, so I am surprised you are having issues. Your idea of a "sync test" button is a good one, and I will add it to the requests list. I have considered adding a sync now button before, but I am not sure it is necessary if sync is working properly. Specifically, as of the recent update the app will now sync whenever it is made visible, which for most people will be sufficient to show changes made in the web version.<br><br>* Thank you for your suggestions regarding Kickstarter and PayPal. But for now the impediment to more FP development is time, not money. I wish someone could donate that! :-)</div>

<div class="content">Regarding the scroll to bottom feature, i'm starting to think that a "bottom edge swipe" might be a good shortcut for it (if it's possible to implement).<br><br>Usually the bottom bar has some controls in it (like the page slider, in FocusPad) and it would clash with a single "scroll to bottom" tap. On the other hand, reserving that space for the "scroll to bottom" tap seems like a waste of precious screen real estate.<br><br>Remember that the "scroll to top" tap is done on the system status bar, which is always present and has no function inside the app.<br><br>———<br><br>On a sidenote :) I'm getting a newfound admiration for the developers of these apps (kudos Tony).<br><br>I'm really starting to *feel* the difficulties if coming up with a fluid mobile workflow just from doing the UI mockup… and I imagine the implementation would be it's own "can of worms".<br><br>The screen real estate is quite small and it's all about making choices and compromisses (e.g. if tap is for edit, how do you get the details? if tap for details, how do you edit?).<br><br>I'm sure the "perfect" app is a quite elusive concept, but i'm hopping "flexible" and "adaptable" is achievable.<br><br>-- <br>Hugo</div>

<div class="content">Rejoining the fray . . . .<br><br>I did download Clear onto my iPad which is the only device on which i can use it as I already have an Android smartphone and a Windows Toshiba notebook.<br><br>After a few days, I must say I like Clear's simplicity although it's not enough as the sole reason to move to an iPhone.<br><br>So my main problem is I cannot always have iPad with me, so one workaround is for me to write the chain in my Moleskine Pocket notebook and work it from there.  When finished, a few swipes left and right would set up Clear again for the next chain.<br><br>  This would stop me being distracted unless it was something that was important and urgent and not yet on the chain.<br><br>Has anyone who has been using Clear moved to FocusPad or other electronic method?  I especially like the clean interface of Clear.  I find that the more options and features there are in an application, the more 'overhead' becomes an issue for me, like GTD did when I was using MLO.</div>

<div class="content">Again,<br><br>Thanks and very good update. This has to be the best app made for FV and AF right now.  I could even implement SF with some cleverness. I like the fact that I can switch from one to the other of needed.   Search is great as well and I like that the pad name is included in the search as well. <br><br>Frustration stemmed from a very long wait.

<div class="content">A few people here mentioned that syncing in FocusPad was not working for them or was very slow. I just made some changes on the web server that should make syncing more reliable and quicker. Specifically, the changes on your iPhone are synced to the web server in a background task, so the iPhone does not need to wait around for this to complete. This avoids the timeout issues some users were experiencing.<br><br>Let me know if this improves things for you (or causes new problems).</div>
