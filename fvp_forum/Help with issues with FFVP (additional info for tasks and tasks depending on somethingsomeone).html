<div class="content">I've encountered a few issues with FFVP and I'd love some help from people on this forum:<br>- Where do you store additional info associated with a task (e.g. link names, plain long text, lists of things, documents it refers to) and how do you structure that data?<br>- I have a lot of tasks that depend on various things (sports videos that I only do once a day, tasks to call people that I know I won't start calling until after a week, tasks that I have to do after I receive an answer from someone, tasks that I'll start later). What do I do with these tasks? Do I leave them in the system (one long list) even though it will bloat it? Wouldn't something else work (e.g. a second list of tasks "Depending on" something/someone)?<br>I'd love your take on these 2 issues.</div>

<div class="content">Bogdan:<br><br><< Where do you store additional info associated with a task (e.g. link names, plain long text, lists of things, documents it refers to) and how do you structure that data? >><br><br>You can store them in something like Evernote, which syncs between your desktop/tablet and your phone. Give the note the same name as the task. put it in a notebook called Time Management List (or TML) and then you can write comments, put in links, add photos, whatever you like.<br><br><< sports videos that I only do once a day >><br><br>Anything that you intend to do within the next two or three days you can leave on the list.<br><br><< tasks to call people that I know I won't start calling until after a week >><br><br>Put a reminder in your diary/schedule to put the task on your list.<br><br><< tasks that I have to do after I receive an answer from someone >><br><br>Put a task on your list "Janet replied?", which also acts as a reminder to chase them if they don't reply.<br><br><< tasks that I'll start later >><br><br>Put a reminder in your diary/schedule to put the task on your list.</div>

<div class="content">Thank you.<br>So, to summarize, I'd have 3 places where I store task-related things:<br>- evernote/storage for the link names, documents, long lists, etc<br>- a diary/schedule/calendar where I'd basically have a second list (that I reference once a day) for tasks i'll start later or reminders to call people<br>- the main list</div>

<div class="content">In addition to that, you can close your FFVP list at the end of each day with a line.  It helps me identify those tasks I need to do at least once a day.</div>

<div class="content">To address items that I can't do until a later date or that I'm waiting on a reply for, I put the prerequisite criteria in brackets, i.e. [next Tuesday], [reply from Janet], then I dismiss the item and put "review dismissed tasks" on my list for a few days in the future.<br><br>When I review dismissed items, any that are now actionable are crossed off and entered at the end of the list.</div>
