<div class="content">Hi.  Just wondering what is the best way to handle this situation in FV...<br><br>I have a task, i.e. writing in my journal, that I want to do at the end of the day.  I want it to be included in my time management process, i.e. to have it written down in my list and crossed off when done, (rather than treating it like a routine time-determined task such as breakfast) - at least for now until I make it a habit.<br><br>I suppose I can just write it on the list, and include it when selecting what is destined to be the last chain of the day.  Any thoughts?<br><br>Thanks.<br><br>Regards<br>Steve</div>

<div class="content">Steve<br><br>I would not write that item on my FV list.  Since it is a task you want to do at the end of the day, it might be wiser to put it in you daily timetable.<br><br>I would find that putting it on my FV list would only obstruct the flow of the FV list and I would run the risk of not getting to it when I really want to do it.<br><br>One question I would ask you is why you would want it on the FV list in the first place.  If your concern is to make it more likely that you would not neglect it, there may be better ways of ensuring this, e.g. by keeping your journal on you bedside table or better still storing it on your pillow so that the development of your "habit" would be more likely to succeed.</div>

<div class="content">Steve Schapel:<br><br>I agree with jim. If you have a task and you know exactly when you want to do it, why do you need a time management system (of any kind) to tell you when to do it? Creating a habit is better done by some form of reminder or alarm.<br><br>If you want it on the list for the sake of keeping a complete record of what you've done, you could just write it at the end of the list when you start it and cross it off when you've finished.</div>

<div class="content">Thank you very much for your comments, Jim and Mark.  I shall act on your advice.  I guess it has highlighted for me that I do not presently have an adequate system for keeping those types of tasks in front of me, so I will work on sorting that out.</div>
