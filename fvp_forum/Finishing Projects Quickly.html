<div class="content">How do you go about making sure FV tops off projects as quickly as possible?  I want to finish projects to get real results, but at the same time, I often feel like if I touch a project once today, I can ignore it until tomorrow.  Since I don't want that, I'd like to know if there's any way you like to use FV to get yourself to finish something in a more timely matter.</div>

<div class="content">Each day I set myself three accomplishments. To choose an accomplishment, I imagine myself at the end of the day reflecting upon what I had done. In the morning I try to pick something that I think would make me feel satisfied, if I knew at the end of the day it had been completed.<br>Invariably, I will not feel good having just opened a folder or touched a project. I will want to have done something tangible: finished the first draft, called Person X to talk about Project Y, written 5 ideas about Z, etc.<br>I will allow work on these three daily accomplishments to override my FV list order. I view the FV list as things I do in my "discretionary" time. My three goals for the day, however, are not discretionary--they are mandatory--hence they trump everything else.<br><br>I got this idea from the posts about JD Meier's Agile Results. It has been working quite well for me. FV keeps me on top of all of my commitments. The three daily accomplishments keeps me from "churning," or being very active without doing much that is meaningful.</div>

<div class="content">Do you sometimes use FV to process these daily accomplishments a certain way?  I'm also interested in seeing if people are processing their projects in a certain way with the FV algorithm to get them done.</div>

<div class="content">All my commitments are in FV. In the course of the day, I will put my three goals in my FV list. But, if it looks like I am not on track to accomplish my three goals in the normal course of using FV, I will stop FV and work directly on the goals.<br><br>FV is for discretionary time. If I am in risk of not accomplishing my three goals, then I declare that I have no discretionary time. I leave FV and focus on my goals.</div>

<div class="content">Hmmm.  Well, that's one way to do it.  I'm also looking to see if there's a way to accomplish something like that while using the main FV algorithm.</div>

<div class="content">You can try this tweak: <a href="../fvp_forum/FV with Today List - tweak.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/fv-forum/post/1833501</a> It was very helpful for me - having "fast/today track", like in superfocus, and put your projects there.</div>

<div class="content">If you want to FINISH projects,<br>you can try to search this site for "3-Task"<br><br><a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/display/Search?moduleId=1292867&searchQuery=3-Task" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/display/Search?moduleId=1292867&searchQuery=3-Task</a></div>

<div class="content">Hail2U!<br><br>This is doable using only the FV algorithm but it requires a level of self-mastery that I lack.<br><br>At the start of the day you review your list. If you do not see three very important things that you want to accomplish for today already on the list, you add the ones you need to the bottom, as the FV rules state.<br><br>If you want, you can put some kind of mark before or after the three special tasks, e.g. an exclamation mark at the end of the task description. This is not required.<br><br>Now, you work your list as per the FV rules. You make sure that you get your three important accomplishments accomplished.<br><br>If I were to do this, I would want to make my lists short, so that if I don't complete the accomplishment in my first work session, I would have another 1 or 2 work sessions before the end of the day. <br><br>I think this is a great way to work. It has the advantage of all of Mark's recent systems in that it uses the attractiveness of some tasks to motivate me to work through other tasks I find more averse.<br><br>If I am highly motivated to get my Big Three done, the system will get me to do a lot of other things as well. <br><br>As I am writing this, I am thinking that maybe I could ease into this system. On Monday, at work, I will do this for One Accomplishment. If I can pull it off for a few days, I will gradually work myself up to the Big Three.</div>

<div class="content">This 3-Task thing is something I want to check out more of, and it fits great as part of a FV "chain".  The key would be to select the right things to make progress on, and to make sure the tasks aren't too big, but I'm going to mess with this for a bit and see how it follows through.</div>

<div class="content">I've been trying AF4-3T for a while now, and I just love it.  By limiting the number of ongoing projects I have at once, along with the size of the list I use every day, 3T ensures I make real progress on stuff.  Plus, with the flexibility of the 3T chain, I can choose other stuff I need to do and get that done as well.  Simply fantastic.</div>

<div class="content">Hi moises. Did you manage to get to the Big Three? As I understand it you're basically "highlighting" three current FV tasks as the Big Three, and just relying on standard FV rules to get those three tasks selected and actioned during the day. <br><br>Anyway, I was prompted to look at FV & 3T after reading this "6 Simple Rituals" <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3003586/6-simple-rituals-reach-your-potential-every-day" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.fastcompany.com/3003586/6-simple-rituals-reach-your-potential-every-day</a> . Specifically, ritual #2 ...<br><br>Define your top 3. Every morning Mike asks himself, “What are the top three most important tasks that I will complete today?” He prioritizes his day accordingly and doesn’t sleep until the Top 3 are complete. What’s your "Top 3" today?</div>

<div class="content">sabre23T,<br><br>I define my top 3 each and every day. That includes weekends. I only use FV when I am at work, which does not include weekends.<br><br>It just is not an issue for me whether I have to leave my FV system to do my top 3. Sometimes, I get the top 3 done in the course of doing my FV list normally. Other times, I leave the list to do them.<br><br>I view the top 3 like an appointment on my calendar. They are not discretionary. I don't have to wait until they come up on the list.</div>

<div class="content">Interesting, I was just about to post how I use a very similar system to organize my tasks but it sound exactly how Sabre and Moises are describing.<br><br>I actually have two lists.<br><br>List 1 are my MIT's<br>List 2 is my Autofocus list.<br><br>List 1 always has exactly 12 tasks and are organized as:<br>-3mit's for the mid year (June 30th)<br>-3 mit's for this month (last day of the month)<br>-3 mit's for this week (last day is Sunday)<br>-3 mit's for today. (by midnight)<br><br>List 2 has all other things and is treated in af fashion.<br><br>I MUST complete items as required on list 1 and once those are under control,  I could work on List 2 just enough so the items on it do not grow in priority or unnecessarily get stale.  I do not end the day under no circumstances unless my days 3mits are complete, so I get them done asap.<br><br>Each month I create 3 mit's that will get me closer to achieving my mid year mits.<br>Each week I create 3 mit's that will get me closer to achieving my months mits.<br>Each day I create 3 mit's that will get me closer to achieving my weeks mits.<br><br>I got this idea from an iphone app called "Most Important Tasks" by MySoft Productivity. <br><br>The balance between list 1 and 2 keeps me focused on the important things and aware of things that need to get done later.  I find it very helpful to focus on creating achievable mit's routinely and obeying the self given deadlines. I also find it relaxing to routinely (morning time) skim my autofocus list to keep stress at a minimum.</div>

<div class="content">Next time I need to shake-up my system, I'm going to try that. It's very similar to my current system. I like how, while preparing for each time-frame, you look at the next-larger. I'm like you: AF alone give too much flexibility when deciding what to do right this moment, but it works well as a catch-all to scan regularly.<br><br>Timer has a few moments left -- off to check that iphone app.</div>
