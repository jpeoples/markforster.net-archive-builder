<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">Loving FV. Simple, fast, easy to explain to others, instantly useful. <br><br>My one and only gripe is that I have used Do It Tomorrow (DIT), Autofocus (AF1-4), Superfocus (SF1-3), and they have all been easy to talk about because they 1) had a simple acronym, and 2) a name that sounded like a name. <br><br>FV is easy enough, and is how I refer to it in my own tasks, such as "test FV apps". However, whereas I could easily tell someone about the cool new "Superfocus", I am really struggling telling someone about the cool new "Final Version". I have found myself referring to what might go down in history as the greatest task management tool EVER as "this really cool task management tool". I am loathe to say "Final Version" because it generates those looks of "Final Version of ....?", and doesn't create the immediate interest Superfocus and Autofocus did. It sounds like a mistake, or like there is more to it that I'm not saying. <br><br>It is also very difficult to find "Final Version" in a search engine. I have been simply telling people to search "get everything done". <br><br>Notice also how quickly we slid into "FV" in the forum, and even Mark chose that as the title (perhaps only for efficiency). There are far fewer references to Final Version. <br><br>I would never presume to rename this true and rare gem of knowledge work, but I felt compelled to open the discussion. <br><br>My best to all, especially "the regulars". Alan, Seraphim, Cricket, Bernie, etc. I'm a lurker mostly, but I have greatly enjoyed the collaborative atmosphere that has clearly been most helpful and influential as Mark developed Final Version. <br><br>Scott<br>Columbus, Ohio, USA</div>

<div class="content">Scott:<br><br><< It is also very difficult to find "Final Version" in a search engine.>><br><br>I checked Google just now for final version (without quotes) and it is on p. 2 of _Australian_ Google. That's a lot faster than AutoFocus or SuperFocus got into an equivalent position even in United Kingdom Google.<br><br>If in doubt I suggest you tell your friends to google my name.</div>

<div class="content">In case it wasn't clear, my interest in this topic is because I am literally BURSTING to tell people about this. I'm not trying to diminish FV in any way. I believe Mark has created a work of genius.</div>

<div class="content">Scott - I may WRITE FV in the forum, but in conversation I SAY Final Version. For me, FV is too fricative and difficult to say. It is, however, much quicker to write - especially for those using smartphones (not me)</div>

<div class="content">Hm, Final Version is on page 2 of Dutch Google also, but from the snippet below the hit it doesn't seem to have anything to do with time management (only from the link is it clear that this is Mark's Final Version).<br><br>Dutch Google on Mark Forster gives the same result as Mark got himself: 6 out of the first 10 are about "our" Mark Forster.<br><br>Suggestion: why not talk about Mark Forster's Final Version when you want to tell people about it? I must confess I haven't talked much about it to others myself, but I haven't done that for AF, SF, DIT either, only when people ask about it. No use trying to convert people to a good system when they feel their own way is working well enough (even if it doesn't :-).</div>

<div class="content">Indeed. As far FV seems to be really the best time management system ever devised (like the other ones devised by Mark were, at their time). Maybe it is true that you can't say the same about its name, one of the less fortunate of all, and not a real name for its own (I mean that the name "FV" has a "real" sense only for us, the users of Mark previous systems).<br><br>Maybe we shouldn't care about that. Or maybe the system will deserve a better name, once it goes beyond this short experimental "beta" period. I think Mark will decide the best, like always.</div>

<div class="content">I concur with Scott.  I am very impressed with FV but the name lacks the magic of the system it represents.<br><br>The full name "Auto Focus - The Final Version" is a mouth full and a provocative working title but for marketing and education it could use a little more jazz.<br><br>Auto Focus (AF) is a great name.<br><br>Super Focus (SF) is a great name.<br><br>The latter is short for Super Auto Focus (SAF).<br><br>A core methodology of FV is a particular way of selecting a sub-list from an AF list.  I would be tempted to suggest the name "Selected Auto Focus" (SAF) but that acronym has already been established for Super Auto Focus.<br><br>May I suggest "Auto Focus Select" (AFS)?<br><br>What ever it is called it truly is an elegant and ingenious system.  It is a great achievement.  Congratulations!</div>

<div class="content">I have to agree with reservations about the name "Final Version."<br><br>MF-23 is not bad at all. Cryptic names work quite while in the marketplace, such as the "ARC" binder or the "G2" pen. The trouble with "Final Version" is not that it's cryptic, but that it's stuck in between cryptic and descriptive. You understand the phrase, only to wonder "Final Version OF WHAT?"<br><br>For a descriptive name, maybe something that includes "chain" or "select." Or "Forster." People talk about the "Covey Quadrants," so why not the "Forster Chain"?<br><br>Forster's Chain, or Forster's Ladder. If Colley has a Rule, Forster can have a Rule, no?<br><br>Acronyms are fine; if there can be a "GTD," then why not an "FV"?<br><br>For that matter, look at the title of this web site:<br><br>Get Everything Done ... GED?<br><br>It fits very well, since *every* item gets preselected, one at a time. No room to hide, no Someday/Maybe, and yet no resistance, leading to ... getting everything done!<br><br>GED. Unfortunately, in the U.S. a GED has another meaning, as a sort of alternative diploma. But maybe that does not matter.</div>

<div class="content">Hi guys,<br><br>What about FiVe ( Final Version )?<br><br>5 is the third prime number. Isn't this the "3rd" time Mark did give us a time management system to study? "Do It Tomorrow", all the ( Auto / Super ) Focus / DWM variants we played with and now the Final Version? And let me tell you, that it really is the best most simple and powerful system Mark has created - and hence I do believe him, the final one for him.<br><br>That's how I am going to promote FivE.<br><br>There are even more analogies one could use, but I leave it to you to find out ;)<br><br>Just my 0.02</div>

<div class="content">Having it appear in searches is good (and probably necessary).  <br><br>My issue is that it's hard to talk about.  Once you say Final Version, you have to play 20 questions to explain the name before getting back on topic.  Even explaining a catchy name (e.g., FiVe) is more interesting than explaining a name that is a description like Final Version.<br><br>Then again, look at all the discussions we've had over it.</div>

<div class="content">I'm too enmeshed with (and an evangelist for) Mark's work to have any objectivity of what would draw someone to any of his systems. <br><br>Beyond All Ye Faithful, a marketing strategy would need to consider two distinct markets:<br><br>1. GTD'ers who have soured on their system<br>2. Overwhelmed folk who know little about productivity systems<br><br>Mark's focus on Psychological Readiness, and other meaning-making processes, would be a nice differentiation point from other systems. Some of the touchstones could include: increasing motivation, reducing procrastination, non partisan (analog or digital), etc. <br><br>Our voices will be the most persuasive "sell" of FV (or whatever it's called). <br><br>The developer of weekplan (an online, 7-Habits, inspired task system) has been gathering video testimonials for his site.

<div class="content">While I agree there could probably be a better name, I am at a loss to suggest one.<br><br>But whatever the name, I'd like to say that I've been using this method for several days now, and find that it works brilliantly. All of the thinking and refining that Mark has done over the years has culminated in a system that works well. It is simple and elegant, and it balances all the aspects of priority, urgency, and psychological readiness. I've had a seemingly impossible workload lately, yet I'm really chipping away at it.

<div class="content">Oh dear. I've really stirred up a hornet's nest here. Not my intention, but in hindsight I can see how it happened. <br><br>Two thoughts, and then I think I'm done with this topic. <br><br>First, several thousand people have seen this released under the name Final Version. If this is truly the greatest task management system we have ever used, then that is an inconsequential number of people. The systems of Franklin, Covey, and David Allen reached millions around the world. If a change is to be made, now is the last and only time to make it. <br><br>Second, I think the brilliant and ever-helpful minds of this forum have hit upon the solution already. What system do I use? "Mark Forster's Final Version". That gives proper credit, respects Mark's name for the system, sounds like a complete thought, is easily searchable, and encompasses ALL the previous systems leading up to this masterpiece. <br><br>Simple, effective, no extraneous fluff, and (through the use Mark's name) a direct pathway for further exploration and learning if so desired. Sounds like that aligns perfectly with FV to me. <br><br>Best to all,<br>Scott</div>

<div class="content">The search engine rankings is interesting.  And obviously especially interesting to Mark.  Only works, of course, to people who already know the name - I'm pretty sure Mark would prefer Bing (or Google if you must) to rank his page highly with a more relevant search such as "time management". But anyway, with all due respect, I don't really see how search engine rankings is relevant to the question that has been raised here, namely the awkwardness of the name "final version" relative to what it describes, and the purpose thereof.</div>

<div class="content">I was thinking a lot like Steve.  If someone is looking for a new tool, method, technique, etc. to get everything done, it almost doesn't matter how they search:  They always find GTD.  Mark wants them to also find FV.<br><br>I also agree that the Google examples don't really address the original topic: the awkwardness of the name "final version" relative to what it describes, and the purpose thereof. While playing 20 questions may not be all bad, it is a distraction from the primary topic.<br><br>In another thread Sabre23t showed that it is being discussed.  That's good but it doesn't address the earlier question either.<br><br>Since I'm not a marketing guy in any respect, I'm not really advocating changing the name.  And I don't know if those Google numbers are good, bad, or meaningful to marketing Marks future products.  Just pointing out that the name might not be as good as it could be.    Scott points it out clearly:  <br><br>"First, several thousand people have seen this released under the name Final Version.

<div class="content">I agree with others here that the Final Version needs a proper, marketable name.  I like DanM's suggestion of "Ultimate Focus" but as a slight variation on that, how about: ULTRA FOCUS.<br><br>For me, this name is not only marketable, but it makes sense on more than one level.<br><br>First, it is truly "Ultra", ie beyond: beyond AF, beyond SAF -- and logically, the ultimate continution (and conclusion) of the "*-focus" group of systems.<br><br>Secondly, Ultra Focus perfectly describes what the system is.  I think its great strength, elegance and beauty is the way it keeps you absolutely focussed on your planned (pre-selected) work.  Something new comes into your world?  Capture it at the end of the list and return to your planned work.  An urgent matter comes up?  Deal with it -- and return to your planned work.  Several urgent things you must deal with?  Capture them all, work through them until all these interruptions have been neutralised -- and return to your planned work.  If that isn't the attitude of someone who has an "ultra" focus, I don't know what is.<br><br>Final Version was a great working title, but now the system is finished it surely deserves better.  As for Google and SEO, no problem.  Continue to make reference to FV as "ULTRA FOCUS: Mark Forster's Final Version of Auto Focus" until the name sticks and the FV working title is no longer relevant except to the history of the system.</div>
