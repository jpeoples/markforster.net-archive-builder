<div class="content">Back up to 718 after a few days of vacation for Orthodox Holy Week (meaning not very much got done outside of going to church) combined with several major projects all coming to a head in the next couple of weeks.  (Work and personal)     Up from 518 one week ago, and 221 two weeks ago.</div>

<div class="content">Currently I have 80 open items. The oldest one is 13 working days old (this is a work only list).<br><br>I think that, apart from the current number, it is also important to know the trend. For me, the number has been hovering around 80 for some weeks. This is to me an indicator that there is a reasonable balance between items added and processed. I'd become worried if the number of open items were increasing consistently.</div>

<div class="content">300, down from about 400 when I started FV a month ago. At the current rate at which I'm entering new stuff and processing old stuff, I'll have touched all items currently on my list within the next 3 weeks. I'd like to have that down to a week, at least for my work items, but I'm afraid I'll have to make some difficult choices to make that happen. I hadn't realized FV would make me aware of that, but it's one more sign this is a great system!</div>

<div class="content">Comment: Both Veggie Jones and Seraphim have noted that long lists tend to cause glazed eyes syndrome.  Nicole seems to concur.  I also tend to agree, which is why I still have many external lists of old stuff, which I inherited from pre-FV days.  <br><br>These lists are called-out from the main list.  When I look at one of these lists, my primary action now is to grab stuff from them and dump them into my FV list.  Over a month I've absorbed several externals, and created one new one, so the overall number of tasks seems to be shrinking, and the FV list remains a manageable length.</div>

<div class="content">176. That's after consolidating three other lists. On Monday it was over 14 pages (plus the equivalent of 4 pages from other lists), now it's electronic. 143 are currently actionable, the rest have future dates. I expect another 20 from remaining lists.<br><br>The old notes took fewer lines than I expected, since many were duplicates or sub-tasks of bigger projects. The latter were mostly demoted to notes, with a few items promoted to lines of their own.<br><br>A few of my tasks are "gathering" tasks. "Room of the day" means pick one and work on it. I almost always want to do that once a day. On the other hand, if you give me a list of rooms I won't want to work on any of them. When I finish the room, I mark both "room of the day" and the actual room as actioned. It's the same with "outside work".</div>

<div class="content">295 active tasks on 41 pages, the legacy of older AF and DWM2 lists.<br>The older pages are *very* sparse, and they tend to die off in bunches as the list consolidates toward the front.<br>Oldest task is one month back, a considerably shorter interval than when I began FV.<br><br>I have not counted my tasks/pages before, but I certainly have the feeling that FV has been moving things along much better. I know it has created less (no) resistance and less fiddling. It's wonderful how the oldest tasks get lopped off one by one.</div>

<div class="content">I find the front of my list keeps getting older, as I go through old notebooks. Some things I can consider "actioned" simply by agreeing they're important enough to move to the new list rather than be deleted, but others (e.g. test smoke detectors) need to keep that original date. (Loving the electronic version for this. It was easy to search for "smoke" and find that I have, in fact, tested them recently. The "annual" cleaning of the root cellar was another story.</div>

<div class="content">My latest chain had 47 items!!<br><br>Five were left over from the prior chain, which I extended, and most of the additional 42 were ideas I'd jotted down about a project over several weeks. The only action for those items was to collect them onto a list for that project, as such a list did not yet exist. It was essentially an extended brainstorm.<br><br>That sure made a dent in my list!

<div class="content">Task count is over 900 right now.   I've had a couple very pressured weeks.  VERY very busy with work.  And lots else going on, college semester finishing for some family members -- and political season is very busy right now -- and we're trying to build a garage -- and so on.   Lots of fun, but lots of new tasks.   And too many meetings reduce the time to actually process the tasks.   Getting lots done and really enjoying it but feeling the pressure...  FV still working quite well, just wish I had more discretionary time.</div>

<div class="content">@ Chris Cooper.   Yes it's too long, I agree.  :-)    Totally new chain takes 20-30 minutes to set up.   I just finished a chain this morning, for the first time in about a week.  <br><br>This is the first time it's taken me so long to finish a chain.   It's happened that way because, lately I've been resetting after long blocks of meetings, not having finished the chain.

All per the rules.  :-)<br><br>I am resetting like this because I have too many meetings and projects right now, and not enough discretionary time.   But there are specific reasons for that, and a lot of this will go away in about two weeks.   I expect to see the list significantly shorten after that.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br>It seems like you can succeed with these long lists for a couple of reasons.  The biggest might be that you have a good feel for what your overall workload will be like (overloaded more now than normal and a reprieve in a couple of weeks).  But you also stick to it and know what is on your list.  Otherwise it would take longer than 20-30 minutes to scan a list of 600-900 items.  Little and often has to be key or your list wouldn't always be so long.<br><br>It's also obvious that you've done a good job of separating scheduled events from discretionary time and understand that balance, even when you can't control it.<br><br>I think there were earlier discussions on the General Forum were the consensus was that the item count wasn't as relevant as it seems based on what people put on the list in the first place.</div>

<div class="content">I'm busy enough having 51 items on my list. 900 tasks would make me collapse. I suggest adding a task AT THE TOP of the list (supposing that you can't make it to the end very often) called: "delete 800 tasks".</div>

<div class="content">Sepaphim, as a matter of interest, how many items do you have on your list now?  My list has grown to about 125, but this is due to me consolidating old lists onto my main FV list.  I feel that I must be between 70-90 items to get the most out of my list.</div>

<div class="content">97. That's a little higher than usual because I'm in the throes of editing a paper so changes I need to make are getting entered as their own tasks. The oldest entry is 14 days old (which is up from my first month or so with FV, when most entries were dealt with in a week); only 21 (21.6%) of them are a week old or more.</div>

No wonder you find yourself using that "partial reset" approach, especially when you get too busy.<br><br>30 minutes to make a chain from 900 items?  That's about 2 seconds of attention per item on average?  By chance, are you stopping at each item to consider "Do I want to do this before I do x?" rather than scanning the list looking for "What do I want to do before I do x?"  There was a previous thread that talked about the subtle difference between the two, and how scanning is maybe 10x faster than considering each task individually.  What if you scan rapidly and create short chains more often?<br><br>I don't have nearly as many items as you do (in the 50-100 range), but it doesn't take noticable time to create a chain because I'm scanning across most of the items I'm already familiar with, and most of the items I'm selecting are the high-priority items at the top of my list or the recent items at the end of my list, and I typically end up with about half a dozen items selected for the chain.<br><br>I just finished a chain as I was leaving work today.

<div class="content">Okay, I timed it.  I spent 70 seconds selecting a chain of 4 tasks from a list of 50 tasks.  That works out to 1.4 seconds per task, which is comparable.  I guess my list is short enough that the time to select a chain doesn't really register as significant.  Interesting.<br><br>It seems like 50-100 items is a lot more manageable than 500-1000...  Seraphim, how is it that you always have so many items coming in?  Is the granularity that fine, or are you including things that most of us wouldn't put in the list?</div>
