<div class="content">I've been investigating the current lot of Android apps.. it seems to me that FV can work very well with Todoist.  Simply flag all tasks within projects as 'Do it today'.  Then you get a lists of taks for the day.   During the day you move these up at down according to what you're working on, other than if they're completed.  Next day they'll all still be there.. maybe with afew more.<br><br>I only discovered the FV stuff this week!  But I'm not clear how it is meant to handle projects - can anyone direct me to some guidance on this?</div>

<div class="content">The best android app I could find for FV is "Tasks To Do Free" by refined apps.  It has four task states: Not Started, Started, Waiting, and Done.  I set the default task state for new tasks as Waiting and use the Started task state for my current chain. I don't use the Not Started state.  You can sort the list by change date, which puts the oldest one at the top, then very easily change the task state by tapping on the task state icon for the tasks you select in the current chain.  Then you can sort by task state and all the tasks in your current chain are at the top of the list.  When you do a task, you can tap the icon for the task state and change it  to Done, or change it back to Waiting.  Changing it back to waiting will put it at the bottom of the list when you sort by change date. Super easy and it follows FV rules very well.  You can even back up the task list to the SD card in your phone, and delete completed tasks as a batch.  It also has a recurring task feature, so if you have a task that you want to do every Monday, enter it and set up the repeat.  Then on the day it is dueit has a bright red flag that says "Today" in it, and it is automatically moved to the top spot just under your current chain.<br>And this is a free to download and use app!</div>

<div class="content">Albrey, I just realized I didn't answer your question about projects.  One possible way to use the Tasks To Do Free app for projects is to use the one task state that I currently don't use, to identify tasks within a project.  The icon for this is a red square, and it filters to the top of the list when sorted by task state.  You could select your most important project that you are working on and set the task state for all of it's tasks to this state and that will keep it front and center when processing the list.  Tasks for other projects should just be processed along with all tasks in the usual FV way.  If a new project becomes your most important task, it is very easy to change the task states.<br><br>I usually get more accomplished if I select one project as the TOP priority and put the other projects in the normal flow of things, so I myself may try this idea to see how it works.</div>

<div class="content">I also 'discovered' Todoist' at the end of July,part of my never-ending quest to find that almost perfect app for task management.<br><br>After a month of using it, I have to say I really like it.  Why?<br><br>- Available across several platforms, synchronising with each, in my case Chrome browser on my Windows 7 main notebook (I've had a problem installing it for Windows per se), Note 2 pocket smartphone, Note 8 tablet.<br>- Inbox is ideal just to dump in stuff as one thinks of it.<br>- Projects and sub-projects, tasks and sub-tasks ie as simple or as complex as you want.<br>- Dates and reminders, or no date at all.<br>- Recurring dates easy to enter eg 'every Friday at 16:00'<br>- Use of '@' to create own user-defined labels eg locations, MIT, FOCUS, WHENEVER or whatever iteration of FV you are using.<br>- Quick views by selecting 'today', 'next 7 days, 'overdue', or by label<br>- Ability to add notes or even files, links to a task<br>- Easy drag and drop to move tasks around.<br>- Daily email before dawn in your time zone showing you what's overdue and what is scheduled for today.  You can set up nagging SMS message if you so wish.<br>- The support is good, quick responses.<br><br>I have set up four colour-coded sections/groups of task below Inbox (default):<br><br>1. Review reminders, Errands, Chores, Checklists eg for packing, stuff way out in the future).<br><br>2. Work Projects including one for work admin.<br><br>3. Personal Projects including personal admin; 50th high school reunion, personal blogs, Google+ etc<br><br>4 Productivity, includes Health/Fitness, ICT Stuff, LTBW (Let The Bastard Wait eg deferred till later or they die a natural death)<br><br>It sounds complicated, but Todoist sorts through the Inbox and everything else to generate what is urgent and/or important, as you see fit.<br><br>For me the key is to dump everything initially into the Inbox, then either work the list or move tasks to a project.<br><br>It is free, with a premium with a premium paid option.<br><br>It is so flexible (only WorkFlowy is more flexible in my experience, good for brainstorming, drafting outlines etc).  I've been able to impose my own structure, yet I don't feel it is complicated, the @ tags help especially.</div>
