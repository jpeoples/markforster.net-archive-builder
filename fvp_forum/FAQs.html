<div class="content">What was not clear for me during first reading (but I must admit, the instructions are very clear, after re-reading you can understand the system fully): Do you go from the currently preselected task only to the bottom of the list or when you reach the bottom (and find nothing to do "before") you can start from the top of the list again? Do you choose only the first task from the list "which you want to do before..." or you can choose more tasks? Do you compare tasks against the first preselected (on the top of the list) or against the last preselected task? <br><br>As I said - you can find all answers in the instructions, but maybe more readers will have difficulties to understand it by first reading.</div>

<div class="content">Locations / contexts.<br><br>Checklists - when to pull them out, when to leave them in.<br><br>Clarifications of the question, and common mistakes.<br><br>I think fleshing out examples and case studies might be necessary, sometimes even examples of doing it wrong. There's plenty of material here for a book. Sometimes we need to spend several hundred words on a concept. It's too easy to read a line, think we understand, and move on before it sinks in. Also, since many of the answers are "it depends on your situation and brain", maybe examples of two different ways, working and not working. Definitely beyond the scope of an FAQ.</div>

<div class="content">If you make a mistake in chain selection, e.g. you realize you want to do #3 before #2, is it better to A) deselect 2 and re-select it (perhaps depending on your response to The Question) B) do 3, then 2, or C) force yourself to do at least some of 2 before 3.<br><br>I was doing C, but now think that A) often works best.</div>

<div class="content">I would like it if you would address the issue of multitasking. There are some tasks that can be done simultaneously (exercise, listen to audiobook, do laundry), and this seems to present a diversion from the usual way of working the list.</div>
<h2>Reply by Bernie</h2>
<div class="meta">2012-03-22 14:18</div>
<div class="content">I suggest the tip mentioned in another thread: when answering "what do I want to do before x?", do not stop at every item on the list. Instead, scan down the list and let the next favored item grab your attention.</div>

<div class="content">- Does it matter how often I go through the list?<br>- How can I see whether I'm falling behind?<br>- How can I diagnose why I'm falling behind?<br>- What can I do about falling behind?<br>- How long should I stick to this before deciding whether it is working for me?<br>- How many tasks can FV handle?<br>- Where can I find guidance on how to manage my commitments, projects and filing?<br>- Apart from FV, what systems do most people need to stay in control? How does FV relate to these systems? (overlap with preceding question)</div>

<div class="meta">2012-03-26 8:39</div>
<div class="content">Hi. Testing FV now, and since my work is mainly project based, with projects that can last for weeks, I'm also interested at specific methods for project handling. For now, I just noted how in stress days I tend to break the method skipping the First unactioned item and going straight to my commitments. Infact, if I have a time consuming First unactioned item, I just can't think of completing it in such days. I mean, in more relaxed days it's a great pull to do things, and I already proved it to be a very good method, but it does not fit all my situations. So I was wandering if there should be some rules for particularly big tasks that cannot be broken down in chunks and how to deal with them.<br>Or maybe I should just delete the tasks that I can't deliver in some occasion and reinsert them at the end of the list. I don't like doing it though, I almost feel I'm cheating the system.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Lorenzo,what is it that didn't work for you before FV?  It sounds like you were getting projects done just fine.  If so, you should continue to do so as you did before.  Use FV for the other stuff at other times.</div>

<div class="content">@ Lorenzo: << Infact, if I have a time consuming First unactioned item, I just can't think of completing it in such days. >><br><br>Remember that you don't have to complete a task at all in the first run. If you do, that's great! Otherwise, just do "little and often" to move the task towards completion.<br><br>Ciao.</div>

<div class="content">@Alan Baljeu<br>Hi Alan. Not exactely. I have used SuperFocus from last October, but I often broke it in the same manner: from time to time I have to face a project and dive in it really deep, that it means that I work 10-12 hours a day. In those situations I can't manage to follow no system at all, I just go with my pace. When times are more relaxed both systems has proven their strenghts, but I definitely prefer FV cause it forces me to consider all the list every cycle of actions and face the older items on the list. With SF I tended to stuck too much in one page, maybe because I wanted unconsciously to fulfill the page, I don't know. Also with SF I tended to let it go a bit when times were really calm, as if I thought I had all the time in the world so there was no need to follow the list. Off course that stagnation did not help me, putting me in bad attitude to do whatever thing I was planning.<br>A worst stop also happens typically when I finish a big project, as I feel a great emptyness (lack of adrenaline must have a part in it). Then, I slowly recover and in a week or so I can get back to rhythm, or not.<br>It's really hard for me, and it's not uncommon for freelances. I know other people that have similar problems.<br>It's too early to judge FV but for now I suspect it's way better for me then SF in a normal situation.<br>But I'd like to use it more extensively, also during hard pressure days. I'll keep trying.<br><br>@Stefano F. Rausch<br><br>You're right, but there are some tasks that just take much time and you can't work that way. ES go in some place relatively far, or visit some public office you know you'll spend an entire morning ecc.</div>

<div class="meta">2012-03-26 21:48</div>
<div class="content">@ Lorezo: I might be totally off-track here, however, your examples suggest that:<br><br>"If the first task on the list can't be done now for some valid reason (e.g. wrong time of day, precondition not met, bad weather), then cross it out and re-enter it at the end of the list. Use the next task as your starting benchmark."<br><br>should be applied in your situation. Same would be applicable when you are "deep" in a project. Your judgement in that moment is the correct one and hence you should follow your "inner voice" - as long as it is not a way to escape certain tasks ;)</div>

<div class="meta">2012-03-27 12:58</div>
<div class="content">@Lorenzo<br><br>Also, remember that with FV, you almost always skip the first task on the list. It becomes the LAST thing you work on in the open chain of selected tasks.<br><br>If you get to the end of the chain and still can't work on it, that is the time when I would deal with it by putting a reminder in my calendar to pick it up when I'm likely to be free.</div>

<div class="content">Ha! You're perfectly right Stefano, I would have read better the rules.. but I hope to take further control of my projects too in the future with the help of FV or some other system. I'm sure there's a sort of training to use the method in the right way.<br>And thanks for the advice Will, I'm going to apply it the next time I have similar situation. At least that sound less like chating, there's a reason for such a decision and I'm not posponing arbitrarily.<br>So thank you both guys.</div>

<div class="content">Perhaps your situation may really require long stretches of absolutely committed concentrated work.<br><br>I used to think that way about my own work.  But Mark wrote somewhere about it, and how "little and often" really can be applied to most of these situations, and produce better results, with less frustration, less up-to-the-deadline last-minute pressure, and less burnout.<br><br>I didn't believe it at first, but having followed his systems for the last three years, I've come to believe he is correct.  <br><br>I suspect most of us who feel we "must" work in those marathon sessions are really fooling ourselves.   We are addicted to the "high" we feel when working in that mode, and the sense of accomplishment when we're done.  <br><br>Again, your situation might really be different, and I am not trying to second-guess you.   Just some food for thought.</div>

<div class="content">This isn't intended to be a thread for answering questions, but since several people have tried to answer Lorenzo's concerns, I'll have a go to.<br><br>The simple answer is that if the first item on the list can't be done now (i.e. in the likely duration of the pre-select list) for any reason then it should be crossed out and re-entered at the end of the list. This is not cheating the system. it is specifically mentioned in the rules.<br><br>However it should be born in mind that most projects can have some preparatory work done on them, even if the main bulk has to be done in one go.<br><br>it should also be born in mind that the first item on the list is also the last one done in the preselect list.</div>

<div class="content">Many thanks to everyone who has suggested questions. I intend to use them all (though some may need to be combined with others).<br><br>I'm going to close this  thread now as I've got enough questions to be getting on with. I will never get the FAQs written if questions keep getting added. Don't worry, there will be plenty of opportunity in the future.</div>
