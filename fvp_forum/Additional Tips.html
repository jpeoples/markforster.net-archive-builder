<div class="content">Mark wrote these in the FV rules page.  I'm astounded at how much I need to be reminded of these.<br><br>The best way to sink any time management system is to overload it right at the beginning. FV is pretty resilient, but at this stage you aren't. So build up the list gradually. My advice is to start off with the tasks and projects that are of immediate concern to you right now, and then add more as they come up in the natural course of things.<br><br>Tasks can be added at any level, e.g. Project X, Plan Restructuring, Call Pete, Tidy Desk. <br><br>If the first task on the list can't be done now for some valid reason (e.g. wrong time of day, precondition not met, bad weather), then cross it out and re-enter it at the end of the list. Use the next task as your starting benchmark.<br><br>If at any stage you find that a task on the list is no longer relevant, then delete it. <br><br>If you find that your preselected list is no longer relevant (e.g. if you have had a long break away from the list), then scrap the preselection and reselect from the beginning. A shorter way to do this is to reselect only from the last preselected task which you haven't done yet.<br><br>If one or more very urgent things come up, write them at the end of the list and mark them with a dot so that they are done next. If something already on the list becomes very urgent, then move it to the end of the list and mark it with a dot in the same way.<br><br>Remember that the aim of any time management system is to help you to get your work done, not get in the way of doing your work. So don't be afraid to adjust priorities if you need to. However try to keep this to a minimum - stick to the rules whenever possible as they will ensure you deal with your work in a systematic way.</div>
