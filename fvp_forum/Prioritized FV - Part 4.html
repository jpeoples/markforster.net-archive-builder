<div class="content">I'm getting as tired of this thread as everyone else, but I don't want to just drop it on the floor and fail to respond to people.  I'll try to keep it shorter; this thread has consumed too many hours of my time and attention.  I haven't posted in a week because I've been swamped with urgent tasks that have mostly kept me from working my FV list at all.  I started chain #14 on May 22, and didn't finish that one until May 29, when I also worked chain #15.  I was completely off-list on May 30, but worked a one-task chain (monthly report) yesterday as chain #16.  I'm now on chain #17.</div>

I was careful to make the smallest tweak possible to achieve the goal that I had.  As Seraphim rightly points out, this slight change to the mechanics has a substantial effect on the dynamics, but that's the entire point.  So far, it's still working much better for me than standard FV, though it's still hard to stay on-list and work enough chains every day.<br><br><< Deven's states:<br><br>"... the FV algorithm draws attention to the first item, and standard FV indiscriminantly uses the oldest unactioned task, while Prioritized FV draws attention to the oldest unactioned task at the highest priority level."<br><br>This contradicts itself because if you are giving something a high priority then you want to do it before other lower priority tasks. This is the definition of "priority". >><br><br>This isn't contradictory at all.  Here's what you wrote in the FV instructions: "Notice what has happened here. The root tasks (the ones in italics) have been done in strict list order, regardless of importance, urgency or any other factor."  Prioritized FV places the high-priority tasks at the top of the list, so when the root tasks are done in strict list order, they will come before the lower-priority tasks.<br><br>Note that this is only about root tasks, not the rest of the chain.<br><br><< Therefore the question "What to you want to do before x?" would already have resulted in the high priority task being selected. >><br><br>That's what I hoped would happen, but for high-resistance tasks, it doesn't.  Whatever the benchmark task may be, I do NOT want to do the high-resistance task before it.<br><br>You've said that I must be interpreting the question wrong if I'm not selecting the task, but remember what you wrote in the FV instructions: "There may be a whole variety of reasons why you might want to do one thing before another thing and all of them are valid."  This strikes me as inconsistent.  It seems that "all of them are valid" only until it drives a need to tweak the system?<br><br><< If it doesn't, it's because you are not actually giving the task priority. >><br><br>I agree that the task isn't being given priority in practice when it doesn't get selected for the chains.<br><br>Prioritized FV is designed to work around that problem by separating the decision on what SHOULD be a priority (be adding or removing stars) from the decision of what to do before the benchmark task.  Any prioritized task can still be selected just as easily from the top of the list as the bottom, and if it isn't, it will flow through the "magic slot" at the top of the list where the FV algorithm forces the root tasks to be done in strict list order.  This applies "little and often" more to any high-resistance high-priority tasks, and doesn't harm low-resistance ones.<br><br><< Giving a task top priority is not a matter of putting stars in front of it and moving it around the list. It's a matter of doing it first. >><br><br>All well and good, but how does this address high-priority high-resistance tasks?</div>

<div class="content">Deven, you've already admitted that the high urgency, high resistance task that triggered your creation of P-FV was a faux-urgent task.   FV actually revealed that fact to you by letting it be ignored.   You are losing one of FV's great strengths,  this sifting ability.<br><br>Also, FV handles urgent interruptions seamlessly and elegantly, by letting you extend the chain.   P-FV can't allow that, because it would prevent you from working on the starred items.   Maybe this is one reason you tend to go off-list when urgency crises hit.<br><br>Just some food for thought...</div>

<div class="content">I also have urgent items I am resisting and just don't have any natural desire to do.   But part of me knows that it needs to be done, and I *do* want to do the things that *need* to be done.   It's something I've committed to, and I *do* want to keep my commitments.   At some point, this aspect of "wanting" ignites in my soul, and the item says "I am ready to be done, get it done!!"<br><br>If that never happens, then it's a sign the task really isn't that important or urgent, even if I consciously think it is important, or even if my boss or someone else is telling me it's important.   The task loses the battle of relative importance and urgency, and doesn't get done, and generally I never have any regrets about it.  Actually, I've NEVER had any regrets about these.<br><br>Also, my boss doesn't even notice, because the same thing was happening to him:  he thought it was important, but later realized it really wasn't.  If he *did* care or still think it was important, he would keep talking about it, or asking me about it, and that would prompt me to take action.<br><br>Putting stars next to items you think are important destroys this feature of FV.</div>

<div class="content">My problem with FV was the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th dots in each chain. The first dot was often on a task that really should have been dismissed. I didn't have the time to do it right, and they just hung around, getting tiny bits of work when it each time they reached the top, and otherwise reminding me of how much I wasn't getting done. By the 5th dot, I reached important things. I knew those early lines weren't important, but it always made sense to do them before the previous dot. I now have half-a-page of Someday/Maybe items. It's a start.<br><br>My week trying FV wasn't. My list of must-dos was long enough that I stayed on that. I barely looked at the FV list. Today I made the mistake of starting the day with necessary tasks that also throw off the rest of the day. I should learn to do those later in the day.</div>

<div class="content">Cricket, I am having a hard time understanding your post.   When you say the first four dots, do you mean the top of the list, oldest items, including the root item?   Or do you mean the first four dots that actually get actioned in the chain, which would be the ones closest to the end of the list?</div>
<h2>Reply by Cricket</h2>
<div class="meta">2012-06-5 2:10</div>
<div class="content">The order they were put on the page. The first dot is the oldest unactioned -- the magic slot, but also the task most likely to need dismissing. Almost anything should be done before it. After a few cycles, all the important projects had been actioned, and the only ones left on the first few pages were unimportant.<br><br>On a scale of 1-100, a typical chain would be 1 2 3 4 7 10 30 58 75 99 --- 7/10 of them were unimportant! Prioritized FV was a way of keeping the unimportant ones out of the way, without admitting they needed to be put off indefinitely. I had hoped that FV would help me make progress on them. I'd have enough time, if I didn't waste so much. And I did make progress on them -- at the expense of the more important ones. Prioritized FV for me was a way to avoid dismissing them. I'm not saying FV will work for me, but those unimportant tasks were gumming up the works.</div>

<div class="content">Cricket - why not dismiss them or put them in a tickler file for 2-3 weeks from now? If they're 'clutter' on the list, get them out of the way. I tend to weed through my home-list when it's over 50 or 60 items, maybe a quarter of them go into the next month's tickler. Next month, some make it back to the list, some get dismissed.</div>

<div class="content">Cricket,<br>I too am having some trouble understanding, so maybe I am missing something. Your chain looks like this: 1 2 3 4 7 10 30 58 75 99. You say that almost all items on your list should be done before number 1. But you do realize that you are not suposed to select items 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 30, 58, 75, and 99 because they should be done before 1. You select item 2 because you want to do it before item 1. You select three because you want to do it before 2. You select 99, not because you want to do it before 1, per se, but because you want to do it before item 75, which you want to do before item 58 and so forth.<br><br>Also, why are you selecting so many unimportant items? In fact why are unimportant items on your list at all? If you want them on the list, then ignore them. Don't select them unless they have achieved some level of urgency.</div>

<div class="content">For me, with FV, it would be a lot more typical to preselect the root, plus maybe two or three oldish tasks of fairly low or medium priority, and then 10 or 20 hot, current, important tasks and projects.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Cricket:<br><br>>  I wanted to do 2 more than 1, and 3 more than 2. Maybe not much more, but enough more.<br><br>It's not "more than" but "before than" the last dotted item. And also, as far as I understand it, "right now" or during the "current working session".<br><br>Time available has been key to help me build useful chains (i.e. without those "2"s and "3"s), instead of trying to build the perfect chain reflecting an ideal "order" between tasks.<br><br>When sitting down to work, factors like time/mood/location all affect what I dot. It's like working the list in the context of "ok, what will I work on before leaving to pick up the kids?", for example.</div>

<div class="content">Hugo: You're right. It's Before. I was thinking "before" when working the list (at least after the first week). At the level I was, though, it didn't make much difference. Given a choice between working on Y before X, or having to wait for the next chain to make progress on Y, of course I wanted to work on Y before X. (And Z before Y, and...) No matter what the question, Y would have gotten a dot, just so I could work on it. I made exciting progress on unimportant things I'd almost given up on.<br><br>For now, though, I'm back to a system that worked well for almost a year (before I got bored with it). It has features of AF and FV and three-choice and time-boxing and scheduling, but fits my personality better.</div>

FV promised (I thought -- I probably read more into it than Mark intended) to help me do that. "Throw everything at it." Putting them back on the someday/maybe list was hard.<<br><br>The thing that I keep forgetting and re-learning about Mark's systems (the ones that I've used - I've mostly stuck to the AF variants and FV) is that things are supposed to fall off of them and not get done.  Especially if you throw everything at it.  They're designed to weed out the stuff that should be on the Someday/Maybe list.  With every iteration of the system that I've used, stuff bubbles to the "do or delete" point and I struggle with feelings of failure and try to push myself harder, but that's not how it is supposed to work.  I'm supposed to be really looking at these things and questioning how much I want to do them.  <br><br>Maybe your perception that you are wasting too much time and should be able to do all this is spot on.  But remember that stuff falling off is sort of part of the design.  We can (and possibly should) always think of more ideas than we can act on.<br><br>Trying to force myself to waste less time has failed for me so many times that I've given up.  But things are changing for some reason.  (Awareness of mortality and the feeling of time running out, I suspect.)  I'm slowly beginning to waste less time - I'm less likely to unconsciously spend hours on the internet.  I get restless and want to do something more satisfying.  I'm hoping that as I observe what's important with the help of FV that my tolerance for brainlessness will diminish.  I suspect I'll always need some, but I want to improve my balance of brainless, important day-to-day, and important life work.</div>
