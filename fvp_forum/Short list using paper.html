<div class="content">I started using FV about a week ago. I haven't used it daily, but when I'm working the list, I don't like having to scan for or remember what tasks are on my current chain. I end up making a post-it or the like with the current chain. Is it just me? What do others using paper do? <br><br>I used SuperFocus for some time. Then and now I'm using a 5"x8" book and write my list on the right page. In SF, I would use the left page for my urgent etc. items. I'm thinking I might use them for the current chains in FV. Maybe.</div>

<div class="content">Put a dot next to each item in the chain.</div>

<div class="content">Sometimes I make a list on a sticky note, but only when I feel like I need to keep the chain in sight because of time constraints or mental tiredness. Usually, though, I use little magnetic page markers that grab onto the edge of the page like a paper clip. They have arrows pointing to the task. It makes it very easy to find every item on the chain without any scanning.</div>

<div class="content">I usually write the chain on a separate sheet and include the task's page number from the book. (Otherwise, I have to search for the line again.)<br><br>Looking at the list, even just enough to find a dot, makes me lose focus from the chain. I tried small post-it flags, but the flow wasn't as natural. I've used a separate focus page for years, so it's comfortable. <br><br>I use a separate pad (actually scrap paper stapled together). I use the same pad (often the same sheet) for temporary notes. Loose sheets of paper are dangerous for me. They get left in other rooms or in my in basket or on my desk, and float around until I read them. Forcing myself to always use a pad -- even if I intend to throw out the page in a few hours -- helps a lot.</div>

<div class="content">I still find that scanning back through the list looking for my dots helps keep in mind everything else so it helps in creating the next ladder.</div>

<div class="content">I find that putting a vertical line through the dot of a completed task, in addition to the horizontal line through the task, helps to make the dots of uncompleted tasks stand out more clearly, and I don't have any difficulty in quickly identifying the next task in the chain.</div>

<div class="content">Once I've selected my chain , usually 5 to 10 items, I list them on an excel sheet in the order that I'm going to do them. I have a column next to them on the spreadsheet where I list tasks that come in the same day that are likely to be done the same day. Any items at the end of the day not done are written in my FV list. <br><br>I use FV to select my closed list , as in DIT, I like to have my workday planned as much as possible and presented to me without the distraction of other items on my FV list.</div>

<div class="content">The same for me as MartyH and Steve Schapel. I do it exactly as Mark showed here <a href="../blog/The Final Version - first look.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2012/2/7/the-final-version-first-look.html</a> and it suits me so well that I even came back from electronic to paper list after years.</div>

<div class="content">I'm with Seraphim, MartyH, Steve Schapel, Daneb ... I've been perfectly happy to just dot the tasks and page backward as I work on them. If an item feels too urgent/important to sit on a middle page (risking that I'll forget it), I recopy it to the end of the list and dot it. But that has been rare.</div>

<div class="content">People are of course free to use the system as they wish, but I can't see the problem with finding the next dot on the chain. After all, all one has to do is look back from the task that's just been finished to the next dot. That must take considerably less time than laboriously writing out the tasks on a separate piece of paper. <br><br>As Steve has pointed out you can scan even quicker if you use the horizontal line to join deleted tasks.</div>

<div class="content">I started FV using FocusPad, and the only reason I'm using paper now is because I can't take my iPod to work with me--having to copy over the tasks I thought of a work or remember what I did when I didnt have my list was driving me nuts. <br><br>So I'm back to paper so I can have one list with me at all times, which works best for me.  I dont have a job with enough do-at-work tasks for two lists to make sense<br><br>I've started using a small circle to mark the preselected tasks, and putting horizontal and short vertical lines through completed ones. I think that since my handwriting can be messy, my brain ignores dots as though they were blotches, but the circles jump out while still being small enough to get crossed off. I debated using a different color pen, but decided that would get too complicated.</div>

<div class="content">Tortoise:<br><br>I notice you say that you haven't been using the system daily. I strongly advise you that whatever system you use you use it consistently. That's the only way to get momentum going.</div>

<div class="content">I'm too sloppy for just a dot to work for me.  My notebook is a artsy, crazy thing I've made myself, and it has no left margins so the dots don't show clearly in the text.  I started almost immediately using a heavy dash to the left of selected items and then when a task was finished I'd strike through the whole line and put a vertical line at the beginning as well.  I still missed items sometimes, so when I had the chance to buy some magnetic page markers like Sarah J describes, I got them and started using them.  And still I'll occasionally skip an item in the chain (but I catch it much sooner.)  It's not a deal-breaker by any means, but it happens about every second or third chain.  I may try Jessica's circle and see if that works better for me.<br><br>With all that, I haven't been tempted to recopy tasks.  I like flipping through the list, and anything important enough that missing it would really be a problem is important enough that I'll remember it was on the list and watch for it.</div>
