<div class="content">My question involves the first unactioned item...  The instructions say if I can't work on it (because of location or other issue) to cross it off and add it to the end of the list.  Then select the new top item as my benchmark.<br>My issue is thus:  I am very often in places where I may or may not be able to work on many items.  I don't want separate lists, because I never know when I can work on all things.  Why should I spend lots of time re-writing these items?  Instead, would there be any harm in selecting the first item on my list that I CAN work on, then continue from there.<br>This would solve the problem of taking a procrastinated entry and further putting it off by dropping it to the bottom of the list...<br>Thoughts?</div>

<div class="content">This is what I am doing too. I use TaskPaper and tag the items I can only do in one place, then I filter out the unavailable items, keeping the original order intact. Further experience is needed, but I think this will help maintain the intention of FV of "structured procrastination" by keeping the pressure on those tasks which have been on the list the longest.</div>

<div class="content">I'd worry that some of those items hang around because you haven't accurately defined what GTD calls the Next Action.<br><br>For example, you need to buy new tires. You run errands, and it doesn't get done. You intend to call the place for an appointment, but business hours close and you still haven't called. This repeats until finally you realize the next action is call your friend to find out where he got his tires -- and that has to be done at home because that's where your social address book is and the time you can reach him.<br><br>In that case, only looking at items that you know can be done now doesn't work, because what you think you know is wrong.<br><br>If you have clearly defined when you can do the true next action, and your system will suggest it at that time, then you won't fall into that trap.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark (non-Forster), you've described my situation too, including my favourite way to game the system - unconsciously or otherwise make sure I'm in the 'wrong place' when important work gets to the top of the list!<br><br>As well as your strategy, (and a bit like Christopher) I'm going to use the technique of extracting lists for various places I'm going <br><a href="../fvp_forum/Category (or Topic) lists.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/fv-forum/post/1760989</a></div>
