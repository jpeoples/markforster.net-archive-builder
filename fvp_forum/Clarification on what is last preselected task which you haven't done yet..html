<div class="content">Could this sentence in the instructions be clarified for me?  Under Additional Tips section:<br><br>"A shorter way to do this is to reselect only from the last preselected task which you haven't done yet."<br><br>If my list consists of 5 tasks<br><br>1, 2, 3, 4, 5<br><br>I take 1 and select 3 and 4.  <br><br>I complete 4<br><br>I then find I am in the situation where I need to reselect for whatever reason.<br><br>The preselect left was 1 and 3.<br><br>Do I select from 3 as the "last preselected task which you haven't done yet" and if so do I ignore 1?<br><br>Or is 1 the "last preselected task which you haven't done yet" since it's actually the last item on my preselected list because I'm going in reverse. Andthen I would just consider 3 in the reselection?<br><br>Hope I am making sense!</div>

<div class="content">My interpretation (which might be wrong) is that 3 is your "last preselected task" because it's further down on your main list. Here's my chain of thinking:<br><br>"Circumstances have changed. It's still true that I must take action on task 1. I've already done some preselection, so it's probably still true that I want to take action on task 3 before I take action on task 1. However, is there anything new that has come up that I need to take action on before I take action on task 3?"<br><br>If this is the correct way to interpret it, then your dots stay relevant. Any other interpretation that I can think of requires erasing dots or ignoring dots or rewriting tasks to get rid of dots.</div>

<div class="content">I'm thinking that's the right interpretation otherwise, as you said, tasks would have to be re-written or dots "scratched" out and that doesn't sound right.</div>
