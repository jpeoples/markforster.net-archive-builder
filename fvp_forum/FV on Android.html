<div class="content">Evernote Android for me. Short bursts of doing while away from computer, and very occasional building of new pre-selected chains. I mainly do my FV on Evernote Windows, that synchs quite nicely with the Android one.</div>

<div class="content">I do it the same way as sabre23t, and for the last ten days I've been able to use the Ipad version of Evernote as well.<br><br>I have not explored Evernote iPad much, but that task is about to go on my list.</div>

<div class="content">Same as sabre23t. Primary use of Evernote (EN) is on my laptop (Windows). I mostly use EN Android to capture tasks while away from my computer. Also useful for shopping lists, chores etc. which are usually first extracted from the FV list on my laptop.</div>
