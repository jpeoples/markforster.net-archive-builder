<div class="content">I really enjoy the FV system and am trying FVP to see if it helps. I enjoy it because I GET STUFF DONE! <br><br>I do find with FV that I create a long preselected list and then as the day goes on I become concerned that I'm missing something. FVP should help with that.<br><br>One challenge I have is losing focus when going through my list for preselection. Any suggestions?  I would appreciate the feedback.<br><br>Typically 100 items on my list. I've given up trying to make the list shorter. Better to just get to work and FV is an excellent tool to accomplish this.</div>

<div class="content">Not sure what you mean by losing focus.   Do you mean, as you scan 100 items, it takes some time, and your mind gets unfocused, and your criteria for selection sort of turn into mush?   <br><br>My list is also very long, and sometimes that happens to me, too.   It helps me to get very pedantic about following the rules.  I say "the question" out loud to myself, and SLOWLY start doing the scans/compares.   This usually gets me focused again after a page or so, and then I can start scanning as normal.<br><br>But when that doesn't work, sometimes it helps just to stop scanning and take action on the last item with a dot.<br><br>Or maybe it means it's time for a nap.  :-)</div>

<div class="content">I get interrupted a lot when scanning my list, which is also long. I work as a manager of a cinema, so I usually only get moments of calm when the movies are playing or at the end of the night.<br><br>If that happens, I just start working on the last dotted item like Seraphim says. Also, you can just write "nap" or "lunch" or even "goof off and do nothing" on your list if you find it difficult to concentrate. You may just need a break!<br><br>I use questionless FVP almost exclusively, as it's way easier for me to scan my list. I don't have to apply a question to each item, which is draining for me. So when I'm having trouble scanning the list, I barely look at it closely, moving fast and only dotting the items that REALLY stand out. I don't worry too much about it, as I know I'll be going through it again and I can catch anything I might have missed. <br><br>If I'm having trouble concentrating on the list because there's something on my mind that's bother me, then I simply write that item at the end of the list. I can choose to dot it immediately as well.</div>

<div class="content">"Do you mean, as you scan 100 items, it takes some time, and your mind gets unfocused, and your criteria for selection sort of turn into mush?"  -- Yep, that's what I mean and good feedback.  I've also found that if I realize the scan of 100 items doesn't take as long as I think it does so I convince myself to relax - that helps also. If I can only scan 10 to 15 items in a minute then the scan of 100 items takes less than 10 minutes.  Versus being productive for an hour or so after the preselection is complete.  That's a good trade off.<br><br>Good point about working on the last dotted item if you lose focus or get interrupted.<br><br>Lot's of good suggestions here.  I've moved to FVP and that's kept me moving faster because I know I'll scan the list in chunks and more frequently.  I also tend to have a better idea before I start scanning what I do and do not want to work on.  <br><br>I think a lot of this comes from having a trusted system and getting things done.  Then you start to relax and have more confidence and synergy takes over.  Good stuff.</div>

<div class="content">Scanning 100 items would take me about 30 seconds.</div>

<div class="content">Once you have the question down to implicit, it's supposed to be just intuitively comparing eveything to the last dot. A or B. A or C. C or D. C or E. Should be quick and easy.</div>
