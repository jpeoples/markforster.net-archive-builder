<div class="content">Going through my list I ask firstly if I WANT to do this task.  THEN I ask if I want to do it before the previous selected item.<br><br>Anyone else doing it like this?  Using this I am able to scan my +-100 items quite quickly.</div>

<div class="content">I sometimes ask, "Do I want to do this today?" On busy days, that helps separate things I need to keep the pressure on from things I want to do when I have time.</div>

<div class="content">To clarify: "Do I want to do this today?" doesn't replace the proper question during pre-selection. It's a separate pass, part of gearing up for the day. It helps me learn what type of day it will be. Knowing it will be a busy day, I'll want to work on urgent projects more than non-urgent ones. If the day will be light, I'll spend more time on maintenance and non-urgent projects.</div>

<div class="content">Only been a few days for me, but I really love it so far.<br><br>I handle it like I handle everything else before the system, but more deliberately.<br><br>1. Select the next item in the list.<br>2. Do I want to do this right now?  <br>   - If yes, do it and return to (1).  <br>   - If no, find the next thing that I might want to do.  If I find it, return to (1) within the scope of the new thing that I want to do.<br>3. Iterate until I find nothing else to work on.<br>4. Work backwards.<br>5. If I don't want to work on something, remove it.  Get over the fact that I am not going to get to that and let go.<br><br>I love this system, but I also like working on tasks a little bit at a time and letting go of things that are not really important to me.<br><br>Thanks Mark.</div>

<div class="content">Nico, if this works for you, great, but it is doubly not FV.<br><br>"Do I want to do this before X?" is not the FV question. The question is "What do I want to do before X?" Mark Forster, in his experiments developing this, has found the difference significant enough to emphasise this in other threads.<br><br>So the idea is to ask the question of item X, scanning the rest of the list to see if there's an answer there. You don't ask a question of each item of the list (let alone two questions). <br><br>If you don't want to do something, then you will not choose it as something that you want to do before X - and so the extra question is redundant.</div>

<div class="content">Nico:<br><br><< Going through my list I ask firstly if I WANT to do this task. THEN I ask if I want to do it before the previous selected item. >><br><br>John Graham has already pointed out that the question is not "Do I want to do this before x?" but "What do I want to do before x?" If you were having trouble with the time you were taking to scan 100+ items, this is probably why.<br><br>I have a further problem with your first question. Asking whether you want to do something is not the same as asking whether you want to do something before something else. You may want to do something first because you want it out of the way, not because you want to do it in itself.</div>
