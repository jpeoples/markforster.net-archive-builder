<div class="content">I originally FV and loved the algorithm. Later, I tried FVP, and found that the question caused too much resistance as I thought too hard about it. I later tried out the question-less variant of FVP and had great success. Because of the mentioned resistance to questions, I first avoided FFVP. Now, seeing that it can be successfully utilized without a question, I have given it an effort.<br><br>Some things I have noticed:<br>* I work through the list MUCH faster<br>* I work on the important things as well as the things that I enjoy<br>* I work "littler" and "oftener"</div>

<div class="content">A question... Do you have to look back at the previous dotted task every single time? In FVP-Q you don't, and I hate having to flip through pages and searching for the last dotted task.</div>

<div class="content">james220:<br><br>Basically the answer is only when you find it necessary. If that's all the time, fine. If that's never, that's fine too. <br><br>Personally I find it important to be aware what is dotted earlier in the list, but not to keep looking at it unless I feel I need reminding.</div>

<div class="content">james220:<br><br>I've struggled with the same problem - "having to flip through pages... searching for the last dotted task" - and I have a few suggestions.<br><br>One, make your dots stand out. You have to experiment until you find a way that works. (I have a squared grid notebook and the first column is only for dots. To mark them off I put a simple line through them so that dots continue to stand out.)<br><br>Two, if you dot an item that's far from the end of the list, immediately cross it off and rewrite it at the end of the list and dot it. Do this liberally.<br><br>Three, routinely [daily or weekly] weed the end of the list by marking the five oldest items with an X and one by one either...<br>1. Kill it. If you're afraid you'll lose it put it on a kill list in the back of your book.<br>2. Move it to the end of the list *if it's something you intend to do in the next few days*.<br>3. Schedule it on your calendar if it's something you know you will or must do, but NOT in the next few days. <br><br>For me, this is critical: do not let items get stranded far from the end of the list. Thinking in terms of "the next few days", and making dotted items stand out (beckoning me to do them), helps prevent stranding.</div>

<div class="content">Mark Forster:<br>I've been trying something out that is similar to your advice. I have only been flipping back to check when I "feel like it". This has pretty much eliminated all of my resistance to this system. Everything is going great!</div>

But you need to be aware that you are using an entirely different system.</div>
