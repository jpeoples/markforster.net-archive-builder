<div class="content">I have a problem. That problem is that I switch my productivity systems every couple of days. Yup, I realize how ridiculous this is. I really enjoy the sorting of tasks, organizing, and systems themselves. As soon as I get deep into the work itself, my "too clever for it's own good" brain points out the flaws and imperfections in my system, so I tweak or change it completely. I've gone back and forth from various versions of FVP, GTD, and my own self-made systems so many times I'm ashamed. It's not good and it's not a joke. <br><br>Let me tell you, in the grand scheme, they are all just as good as each other. The problem is the switching. I've made pro and con lists for all of them numerous times, and depending on what I'm feeling, I can tilt the results of those pro and con lists. So that's not really useful data.<br><br>I'm making a one month commitment to using just questionless FVP. November seems like a good month to do this, as I've got some important projects to work on this month and I can use Nanowrimo as an inspiration. 1 month should give me enough hard data to see if this works for me. When December arrives, I want to look at how much I've accomplished, how my life is going, and how I feel both in general and day to day.<br><br>I'm basically posting this as a public commitment. <br><br>I don't want to debate the merits of one productivity system over another, I'm picking this one for good enough reasons, and if it's not the right one, I'll know that in December. <br><br>Ok, here I go!</div>

<div class="content">Good luck with both Nanowrimo and FVP, Jesse!<br><br>I'm still happy to be back on FVP.</div>

<div class="content">Jesse, good luck.  I too share the challenge of constantly switching systems.  FVP has worked the longest for me in the past few months but I abandoned it also.  I'm now drifting back to it.<br><br>I hope you attain your goal.  Please post here to let us know how you are doing.</div>

<div class="content">I'm going back to FVP, too, after a couple weeks vacation basically constant interrupt mode (for a good reason!), and a week trying out SkedPal (which didn't work for me for technical reasons), then some time using 5T (kind of fun but I have too many details to track).   At least, I'm doing it for my discretionary time.   My real problem seems to be the general LACK of discretionary time!</div>

<div class="content">Sigh. Had a 4-5 day relapse. Switched back to my home-brew productivity system (which is neat, sometimes fun, but endlessly fiddly). Real life hit back hard, and I went straight back to no-question FVP. It's reliable, fast, up-to-date, and I trust it more.<br><br>My other system is a huge distraction. <br><br>Well, back on it since yesterday. We'll see how things go. I feel mentally better now with FVP.</div>
