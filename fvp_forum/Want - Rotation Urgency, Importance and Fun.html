<div class="content">When reviewing my list I tried to define "want" in order to compare items against each other.  <br><br>What I decided is the following:  <br>- Before I start the review I decide if I am going to measure the items based on Urgency, importance or Fun.  <br>- If I decide that I need to focus on urgent items then I will ask myself if this item is urgent and if yes, is it more urgent than the previous selected item.  <br><br>Once this chain is completed I will focus on a "Fun" mindset for example and thus measure the items based on fun.<br><br>Do note that sometimes an item of a fun nature will just grab me even though I am in an urgent mindset and I will then also select this item.<br><br>Any thoughts about this way of selection?</div>

<div class="content">Does it work? Do you find yourself easily going through and achieving the items selected by your redefinition of want?  <br><br>Keep 'want' as a subjective concept.  You may decide you generally want to get some urgent stuff done, or you want easy stuff or fun stuff, or your big project or whatever.  But that's simply deciding what you want.  And then look see what you want before.</div>
