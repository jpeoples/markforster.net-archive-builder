<div class="content">Hi All<br>Really enjoying this Forum. It is an absolute find!.I've been using FVP - I find it quite amazing. <br><br>Tasks in my life seem to silo into 3 main areas. 1. Client work/admin - (all tasks relating to my business)  2. Personal tasks (day to day projects, family commitments, routine stuff) and 3. Important (non urgent!) projects which will allow me to achieve important yearly goals<br><br>I am planning on using FVP purely for items related to my yearly goals. I have a system in Things 3 which works for me in terms of client work. Activities related to my goals seem to take second place to my regular day work far, far too often (I'm self employed). When making  choices between client work and my own personal creative work I tend to just go for the income providing tasks . I'm a musician/producer/composer and my day job is creating music for other people/artists. I use the app Things 3 ( I love it)  for day to day tasks (and KanbanFlow for logging where I am on my various projects). My yearly goals (which are also related to my own creative musical output) seem to be taking second place too often to paid client work. I suppose my question is . Can anyone see any potential pitfalls in this approach of using FVP in one context/area of my life?  Thank you . Absolutely love this website (Thank you Mark) and the community. Best Regards G</div>

<div class="content">With this approach, FVP can help you sort out your larger personal goals and figure out where to focus. However, your main conflict seems to be your longer-term goals and personal creative work always taking second place to regular paid day work. You will still need to have a way to make sure you have time set aside for the larger personal goals in the first place. <br><br>FVP was one of my favorite systems -- I used it for at least a year or two. It is good at sorting out conflicts of that kind. But FVP can't help resolve the conflict between two competing areas of your life, if you use FVP for only one of them.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Seraphim. That is helpful - very good point. I have been experimenting with blocked out time in the past for goal activities.  I think you are right re FVP not solving conflict if only used on one area - which may get pushed aside ! Do you mind me asking what system you currently use?<br><br>Thanks!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Ged,<br><br>I've been using Serial No-List pretty consistently for the last couple of years.<br><a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2730943#post2732758" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2730943#post2732758</a><br><a href="../general_forum/Serial No-List -- Master Thread.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2734132</a><br><br>For the last week or so I've been experimenting with some new ideas. Not much has come of them, I am afraid. :-)</div>
