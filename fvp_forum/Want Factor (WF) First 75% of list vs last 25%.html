<div class="content">What I have found is that the "want factor(WF)" for the items on the first 75% of my list is close to zero.  Thus items on the first 75% of my list rarely beats the first selected item.  (I view if both WF's are zero, then no new item is selected.)<br><br>The action only starts when I get to my last section of the list.  This is where the WF shoots up and I can really measure items against each other as the WF rises above zero.</div>

<div class="content">This suggests you're misreading the question.  It's not "Want" but "Want Before".  I presume you really don't want the first item, so usually there will be something in that first 75% that you would rather do BEFORE you get to that first one.  The idea is to ramp up your work in levels of increasing difficulty until you get to the hard one at the front of the list when you are primed to tackle it.</div>

<div class="content">I was going to answer the same way as Alan, but then I realized if there is Nothing in the first 75% that I want to do, then I certainly don't want to do any of them Before the root task. In other words, that 75% is like a backlog of stuff that may still be important and thus remains on the list, but will only get actioned when each becomes the root. A solution is to make very short chains and perhaps delete a bunch of items.</div>

<div class="content">Ubi: Exactly like you said it.  Do however note that I am totally fine with first 75% just perculating to the top.  There is a reason they ended up in the 75%.<br><br>Alan:  if I can rephrase:  there is mostly no items in the first 75% that I want to do before the root item</div>

<div class="content">I've recently come to this conclusion as well. I am also realizing that if I want to get through the 75%, I need to keep my chains short and frequent.</div>
