<div class="content">Let's say I have generated this list via No List FVP:<br><br>1) buy books online<br>2) check stock market<br>3) clean kitchen<br>4) fix coffee<br>5) clear email<br><br>Now I ask with regards to task #5 whether I want to do anything before doing it.<br><br>Answer: "Yes, I want to check stock market before I clear email."<br><br>Now I have this list<br><br>1) buy books online<br>2) check stock market<br>3) clean kitchen<br>4) fix coffee<br>5) clear email<br>6) check stock market<br><br>Let's say I just work the list until I arrive at this:<br><br>1) buy books online<br>2) check stock market<br><br>Now the question becomes: "Do I want to do anything before I check stock market?" But I already checked the markets! <br><br>What now?<br><br>----<br><br>Another problem is that sometimes I come across a task which is no longer relevant because I either decided to not to do it at all or I already solved the problem via another preceding task. How do I best proceed?</div>

<div class="content">Yes, just cross it off. Mark wrote somewhere that if at any time a task (or the whole list) starts to feel stale or irrelevant, you can just delete it.</div>

All you have to do is cross off number 2.<br><br><< sometimes I come across a task which is no longer relevant because I either decided to not to do it at all or I already solved the problem via another preceding task. >><br><br>As Paul and Seraphim have said, just cross it off.</div>
