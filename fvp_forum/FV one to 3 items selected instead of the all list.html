<div class="content">I wish to share with you an article about jane Wesman I am sure some red it but I found it so interesting. It is very near FV <a href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/19960901/1807.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.inc.com/magazine/19960901/1807.html</a><br><br>I tried it and did it for a week and the results were good for my activities. <br>It is simplier than GTD, the control is realy perfect and it helps to stay focus on things. I made a paralele with Ivy Lee / Schwab who encouraged to take 5 or 6 items depends on the authors and do it first. <a href="http://haziqali.wordpress.com/2010/01/29/charles-scwhab-learns-easiest-time-management-trick-ever/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://haziqali.wordpress.com/2010/01/29/charles-scwhab-learns-easiest-time-management-trick-ever/</a> <br><br>For myself I prefer prioritizing from one to 3  because things evoluates. <br><br>Any thoughts about this ?</div>

<div class="content">Jupiter, I know this article, it sounds very reasonably. I tried such and similar "back to basics" systems. For me, they do not work. I think that if they had worked, I would never looked for solutions like Mark`s and others`. I would just write my "most important" tasks on piece of paper and would go into the world. But in my world/with my personality, I would never be quite happy with it...</div>

<div class="content">Hi Daneb<br>There are 2 methods as you noticed. One is the westman method which is similar to AF and FV exept the rules ie one list per day and the number the 5 most important items and do them one by  one. The secont is more intuitive and axed for me on what is obsessing you....<br><br>With the JW method or MF systems there is a real mesurable pleasure you can easily observe<br>Instead of marking with a dot use a yellow stabilo of all you really fell to do now the mark it with this yellow stabilo. When it is done use an orange stabilo. At a glance you can see, what is done, what is still active but not finished or waiting for and wht is done in orange<br><br>It is great to see the most important items done at the end of the day. And it works for me.</div>

<div class="content">I first tried Charles Schwab's system twenty or more years ago, but like Daneb I just found it didn't work. The trouble is that if one concentrates on the "important" stuff, then when does the trivial but necessary stuff get done?<br><br>Maybe if you're a top executive with loads of underlings to do the donkey work... but that's not a situation I've ever found myself in!</div>

<div class="content">Jupiter, <br>sorry, I missed the link to Schwab`s method. Yes, I use it quite often and it helps me. But I can use it only as "one" of the methods in my set. It does not help much with routines/repeated tasks etc., I agree with Mark. <br><br>I would say: it is necessary to prioritize by importance, but not sufficient...</div>

<div class="content">Using three MITs or six critical tasks does not mean neglecting other things. It means by highlighting those things and making a point of focusing on them, you will have had a very productive day. Other things can be dealt with after them if possible, or before or during them where urgency requires. You can keep a "reminders" list so you don't forget the little things. I've done this before (three MITs + reminders list) and it actually works quite well.</div>
