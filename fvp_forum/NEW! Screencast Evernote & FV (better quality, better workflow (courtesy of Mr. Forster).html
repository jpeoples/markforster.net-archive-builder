<div class="content">Enjoy: <a href="http://youtu.be/7BwmYBXCo-Y" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://youtu.be/7BwmYBXCo-Y</a><br><br>Some workflow bits: <br><br>* Almost all notes get an additional project tag (mostly during my weekly review) <br>* Waiting notes/tasks get the "waiting" tag<br>* I use the body of the note for links to files, updates on task/project and breadcrumbs i.e. where I left off when I last worked on this task/project<br><br>Mark - you've created a killer system! As well, you've also managed to address one of the top questions on GTD forums: "Ok, I've got the whole thing setup, now what?"</div>

<div class="content">That's a really nice implementation Avrum, I don't really use Evernote as I haven't got the premium version which allows for offline use. I use Springpad which allows me to view notes on my android phone. You can set up a similar workflow in Springpad, in fact in some ways it's even more powerful as you can add checklists and use the board function for a more visual approach. But for me it starts to become too clunky linking all tasks to projects especially in Springpad where everything seems to require an extra click.<br><br>You've given me food for thought. If I could get more daily use out of Evernote it might make more sense to upgrade to the full package.</div>

<div class="content"><<You've given me food for thought.>><br><br>Shak - my oldest note is dated: 13 November, 2008 12:13 AM<br><br>I have 4 + years of client notes (saved offline), scanned nostalgic items (drawings, letters from my girlfriend, now wife) & attempted productivity systems saved in Evernote. On rainy days, I go back and read these notes like a journal. Lovely. <br><br>I'm ashamed to admit how much software I've purchased/tried (Omnifocus iPhone & Mac App, Thigns iPhone & Mac App.... ugh), only to return to Evernote. Until FV, I couldn't find a system that worked with Evernote's features. While my mind is closer to Woody Allen than "still water"(GTD reference), it simply makes sense to park, find and do everything in one place.</div>

<div class="content">@David Drake - no, you would need to start from the bottom, and work up. No biggie for me, but I rarely use the iPhone for this sort of thing. <br><br>@DavidG - thanks!

<div class="content">I think Avrum's version on Evernote is excellent as I've already said.<br><br>Apart from the ease of the system itself, there are huge advantages in doing FV on a program like Evernote.<br><br>For a start you don't need to be able to access the internet to work on it. It will synchonize across all your apps. If you've failed to back up your computer and it dies on you, it doesn't matter because you can recover it all from the Evernote website.<br><br>You can tag tasks, search them, hyperlink to other tasks or notes, include notes in the task, and put documents and the like straight into the system. If you're writing a book or article you can write it directly into your task without it disrupting the list. By using tags, you can work on a subset of your complete list.<br><br>It's streets beyond any program that only works on a straight list.</div>

<div class="content">@DavidG: I'm seeing $4.99 per month for offline access or $44.99 per year. Is that just for the mobile apps? <br><br>@avrum: I work the list almost exclusively from my iPhone and iPad. I don't always have internet access and I like to keep the input boxes with me at all times. That's a bit too steep of a price for me. Plus, the process involved in adding and removing tasks was ridiculously cumbersome on the iPhone app (I haven't tried it on the iPad). Am I missing something there? Your screencast looks good and simple enough, but I'd love to see a mobile screencast to see how you accomplish the same steps. I don't think you would be happy with the amount of work involved. But I didn't spend a lot of time, so please correct me if I'm missing some helpful shortcuts to tag in Evernote mobile apps.</div>

<div class="content">Brad:<br><br>the premium-version syncs *all* your notes to the iPhone so you have them available offline.  In the regular version, only notes that you previously accessed on the iPhone while online are available offline. The premium-fee works for all apps: you pay for the premium fee, then all platforms where you've installed EverNote (iPhone, iPad, Mac, Windows, web) know that you're a premium user.<br><br>I have a premium-account, but I find the interface on the iPhone rather cumbersome, so I only use that for accessing checklists or looking up information, and never for making changes to notes or adding notes. Plus I've had changes I made on the iPhone disappear, so I'm not very confident of the sync between iPhone and website. I haven't tried the iPad-interface yet, it looks a bit more usable than the iPhone-interface.<br><br>I use EverNote a lot though for keeping track of notes, ideas, articles I'm writing etc, but not for keeping my FV-list.</div>

<div class="content">Same comment as in the <a href="../fvp_forum/Electronic Version.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/fv-forum/post/1755772</a> thread.<br><br>@ Mark Forster: I couldn't agree more! Evernote ( EN ) is a ( nearly ) perfect working environment for … projects. And that's the reason why it is my first choice in that respect.<br><br>However, as some others have already pointed out, EN Desktop and EN Mobile do differ in a few aspects, amongst others:<br><br>-- different way of handling the view of tags : doesn't reflect the desktop structure on the mobile side, just one long list to scroll through.<br><br>-- to the mobile environment adapted handling of notes, which is more than acceptable, if you are on the run and complements the working with the desktop version.<br><br>What I'm seeking is a magical balance between a simple, but powerful way of tackling non-project related tasks and your Final Version Time Management System. By the way, I am applying FV within EN for projects ;)<br><br>The ( system ) setup should reflect the beauty of paper and pen as well as the power of electronic data manipulation, if the need arises. Furthermore, to pick up the hat analogy, I do like to work focused in a "simple task" mode and in a "complex project" mode. Both ways are fun - and that is important, but do have different ways of being handled efficiently and effectively. At least that is my understanding:<br><br>-- simple task mode : most of the cases one doesn't have to keep in mind complex relationships between different tasks or conditions to be applied. The job is usually straight forward. - Here EN does not excel. *astrongandcontroversialstatementupfordiscussion*<br><br>-- complex project mode : the starting point is literally the opposite to the "simple task mode". Relationships between, dependencies of other and preconditions for tasks - just to name a few variables to take notice of - do mandate a different setup, to be in the position to fully grasp the big picture as well as to handle the tiniest detail. - Here EN excels!<br><br>I think that in my opinion I currently have found the best choice for myself for the "simple task" mode with TaskPaper. However, I don't want to argue that there are possibly very good alternatives to it. Of the top of my head Notational Velocity does spring into my mind … it really boils down to one's each personal preferences and the own working style.<br><br>Conclusion: Every approach is good as long as one does believe in it and feels comfortable with it. No doubts about that!<br><br>P.S.: It's nice to exchange views :)</div>

<div class="content">Thanks to both of you, Mark and Avrum, works like a dream on Evernote and I'm using the free version.<br><br>I appreciated avrum's candour where he mentioned "attempted productivity systems", a lot of us have been there, done that, got the t-shirt.<br><br>What I really like is that one can drop notes, snippets, links, text anything in relation to a task so that one can see what's been done so far.<br><br>Internet's been a bit iffy here in Kampala, Uganda (thanks partly to a ship dragging its anchor over the East Africa undersea cable in Mombasa last month), but today I managed to view avrum's clip.

<div class="content">Avrum:<br><br>I think Evernote might not work well if your preselected list is left unfinished. In that case, Mark recommends "starting from the last task on the pre-select list, reselect from there to the end of the list". But this can't be done in Evernote, since all pre-selected tasks will already have been moved to the end of the list.<br><br>[That's a good point, though one can still bring individual tasks forward if they are urgent. Oddly enough seeing the preselect list on its own seems to have considerably reduced my desire to add tasks to it - I haven't felt the need to do it once even when I got up this morning. - MF]</div>

<div class="content">When you sign up for Evernote, they give you an email address. Anything you email to that address goes to the default notebook (aka inbox). There are quick codes to designate folder or tag. I find that very useful.<br><br>(definition: Notebook = collection of notes)<br><br>Evernote apps are free for all devices. You pay for the premium account features. According to the forums, it's safe to pay some months and not others. You lose the premium features (automatic syncing of entire notebooks and ability to share with friends), but your notes are safe, and you can upgrade again easily.<br><br>With the iPod Touch, Evernote will store whichever version of a note you downloaded to the iPod. You can edit it offline. It will send any changes you make to the master version next time you're online. You can "star" individual notes, which will then stay in sync with the master (online) copy whenever you're online.<br><br>The PlayBook app might have been a good start, but currently you can't even type on it. When you type, it repeats words and letters. (The recent comments agree. The earlier version you could at least type and sync with). It doesn't support any of the premium features, yet. I side-loaded the Android app. It supports some of the premium features. It's not as nice as Docs2Go for typing, but it works. Offline use is the same as the iPod, but you can't set individual notes to stay synced.<br><br>With the paid subscription, you can apparently set entire notebooks to stay in sync. It only syncs the notebooks you tell it -- which is good if your database is larger than your device. You set the synced notebooks in each device.<br><br>I played around with syncing attachments. I don't remember the details, but docx files created or edited on the iPod can't be created or edited on the PlayBook, and vice-versa. Anything created on a mobile device can be edited on the laptop, but when I created a docx file on the playbook, attached it to Evernote on the playbook, synched it, edited it on the laptop, and synched again, the PlayBook said the file was corrupt. Very frustrating. I've also tried Box.net and DropBox, since I have several large docx files I want to carry with me and edit, and they had the same result, so the problem is probably the apps that edit the files, not Evernote (but it's still frustrating).</div>

<div class="content">My paper notebook was on the penultimate page, so I have been doing avrum's EN method today (Windows desktop version). <br>It does work. I am not yet convinced that it is better than paper. But there are obvious advantages: searchability, better penmanship, links to notes and files, hyperlinks to web sites, easy processing of recurring tasks, elimination of clutter from completed tasks, and lots of space (sometimes it was hard for me to fit a lot of info in my paper notebook).<br>I did DWM in Excel for over a year (and was very happy with it), so I have nothing against digital systems. But I know I would have stayed with paper FV for another few weeks had Mark not given EN his Forster Seal of Approval. <br>Thank you Mark and avrum!<br><br>[The biggest advantage I have found is the ability to focus on just the Preselect list - MF]</div>

<div class="content">Nope, PlayBook and Android apps don't claim to have shortcuts for date entry. (Add to bottom of FV list: Access Evernote through the web on both devices, see what I can do.)<br><br>Another option: <br><br>On Windows, you can edit the date a note was created. It's a bit tricky to find. Find the title of the note. Look to the right. There's a drop-down list of your notebooks, a circle that I don't understand, and a tiny down arrow. Click the down arrow to see date created, author, history, source URL, and other things. Click date created.<br><br>(Add to FV list: Does this work on devices via web interface?)<br><br>I'm with FSE. I don't like sorting by date updated. Tasks update themselves every time I blink. If I add a tag or add extra notes without actually doing the task, it updates and moves to the bottom of the list. If I want to avoid something, I just have to add "I don't want to do this today either," in the body of the notes.<br><br>[Doesn't adding tags or extra notes to a task count as doing some work on it? In that case it should move to the end of the list. - MF]<br><br>The note section looks useful. It can keep track of where I am in a large project, or when I did a task last, or the how-to page for something complicated.<br><br>You can also copy a task by right-clicking.<br><br>BTW, on Windows, ctrl-click selects (and unselects) individual items in a list.

<div class="content">Another way might be to sort by date created instead of updated. But this means that unfinished tasks will have to be duplicated, then deleted. A little kludgy, but it seems to work.<br><br>[I would think that the downside of losing the automatic re-entry of unfinished and recurrent tasks would be far greater than the minor inconvenience of not being able to identify the original position of the last unactioned task on the Preselect list.

You really missed the feature, when you're used to it. <br><br>One key usage tip, is to log your latest notes at the top of EN notes body. So you'll see it first, without needing to scroll the body. Newest on top is also inline with default EN list sort, further more, newest on top is the only sort direction on EN Android.<br><br>Even when I was doing DWM on Excel spreadsheet, I simulated long note by putting a hyperlink in a cell, pointing to a TXT file with the long note.</div>

<div class="content">I am trying to like Evernote, but I am having issues with it. It seems too much just for a simple list of tasks. What is annoying me the most, at the moment, is when adding a new task (CTRL+N) it defaults to an untitled task and the cursor goes to the note rather than the note title. So I then have to click in the box to write the task. This is too clunky for me. Is there a way to change this Evernote behaviour?</div>

<div class="content"><<So I then have to click in the box to write the task.>><br>Hi Wooba - the first line in the note is automatically captured in the note title, so you will find your task description on the note title when you are finished typing.</div>

<div class="content"><<One key usage tip, is to log your latest notes at the top of EN notes body>> <br><br>So sabre, do you then scan your list bottom up rather than top down? Yes, I've noticed that EN on Android has that default behaviour.</div>

<div class="content">Here's a heads-up for EN Windows users. Today, around noon, I kept getting "Synchronization Failed" messages. I read the Activity Log and rebooted. Still no go. Googled the problem and emptied the trash. Problem solved.</div>

<div class="content">Yes JD, as per FV standard rules I preselect scan from the oldest to the newest. That is from the bottom to the top in the default EN newest first list sort.<br><br>When preselecting, rather than multi-select by ctrl-clicking, I instead tend to single select, which shows the title&body of the task/note at bottom of screen. Then I tag "!Do" the selected task, and use the mouse scroll wheel to scan for more tasks to select. <br><br>Scrolling with mouse doesn't move the cursor focus and hence the selected task/note at bottom of screen doesn't change. So the benchmark for "What I want to before I" is visible at the screen bottom, even when it is not visible in the list.<br><br>Referring to EN Windows.<br><br>Moises, emptying the trash without rebooting didn't solve my synchronization failed problem. I'll try again tomorrow, perhaps with rebooting. It's 1hr past my bedtime now. :-/</div>

<div class="content">I've switched to EverNote last week for FV, with great success, but one thing kept bothering me, which is whether or not the time stamp of a note gets updated when adding or removing tags. This is important if you want to keep sort order intact when for some reason you need to scrap the preselection. Initially I thought it wasn't a problem, because on EN-Windows adding or removing a tag won't change Date Updated. BUT, at home I'm using a Mac and on EN-Mac adding or removing a tag *will* change Date Updated.<br><br>Today I found a solution: if you're adding or removing a tag by clicking in the tag-bar of the note, Date Updated will change (on EN-Mac). However, if you add a tag by dragging the note to a tag in the tag-list, Date Updated remains unchanged. And if you scrap your preselection by ctrl-clicking on the tag in the tag-list and then choosing "Remove tag from all notes" Date Updated remains unchanged.<br><br>Now I still need to figure if I can find a way to keep sort order intact when doing this on the iPhone...</div>

<div class="content"><< Initially I thought it wasn't a problem, because on EN-Windows adding or removing a tag won't change Date Updated >><br>Caution. On EN Windows, if the tag removed was the only tag on the task, date Updated is changed.<br><br>So to ensure I don't run foul of this "feature", I've just created a tag "!", preselect list aborted, to accompany "!Do", preselect list. Today was the first day I aborted my preselect list. I multi-select the aborted tasks, add "!" tag, remove "!Do" tag. <br><br>Psst ... Actually I forgot to do the above. I approximated it by adding the aborted tasks to "!" tag, and editing the Updated dates to be same as Created dates. Hopefully, next time I abort preselect list, I'll remember the "!" tag. :-)</div>

Right-Clicking on the "!Do" tag in the tag list only have the following options ...<br>* Create a tag in "!Do" ...<br>* Rename<br>* Delete ...<br>* Hide Unassigned Tags</div>

<div class="content">Hi sabre23t,<br><br>yes, I'm aware that removing the last tag in EN-Win does change Date Updated. But I'm using .w, .h and .a tags to have the possibility to separate my list into work and home lists and stuff that I can/want to do anywhere, so I'm never removing the last tag from a FV-note. So for my setup, it works well enough. Oh, and I have a saved search to check occassionaly if I have any FV-notes without a .h or .w tag.<br><br>I'm a bit disappointed though, that the EN user interface has all these subtle differences between the Mac and Win versions.</div>
