<div class="content">+JMJ+<br><br>With my self realization that I posted here,<br><br><a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/fv-forum/post/1758575#item1763837" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/fv-forum/post/1758575#item1763837</a><br><br>and confirmation from the thread on "The Paradox of Choice",<br><br><a href="../fvp_forum/Trusting Mark & The Paradox of Choice (Ted Talk).html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/fv-forum/post/1762725</a><br><br>I am going back to my system, SISIN.  <br><br><a href="../general_forum/Should I Start It Now --- A Time Management System to Exercise One's WIll.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/1740352</a><br><br>FV's philosophy just clashes too much with my own personality: How can I know what I want to do if I do not even know which tasks are the tasks I want to do? SISIN at least lets me "taste" tasks by urgency before committing myself fully.  FV however presents me with too much choice without letting me know whether I DO want to do things in the first place: I am most of the time just guessing what I want to do.<br><br>LOL, it seems, ironically, that FV does not let me want tasks, and SISIN, by removing "want" from the algorithm altogether, does.<br><br>SISIN also gives me less stress.  How? SISIN makes me momentarily forget the tasks I already preselected by combining preselection and doing the preselected in one go.  FV on the other hand has two distinct phases, the preselection and the doing of the chain.  The preselection is no problem, but the doing of the preselected almost gives me headaches because I KNOW what my doing of tasks is leading to is (usually) the most difficult task yet.<br><br>And lastly, SISIN gives me peace of mind.  SISIN has a definite end each day, i.e. it tells me when I have done what I could for today.  FV, however, does not.<br><br>SO goodbye to FV for now.  I don't know if I'm going to pick up FV again, probably when I'm having problems with SISIN (which I doubt), but for now it's back to SISIN for me.</div>

<div class="content">If SISIN works, pursue it with all you've got!  I have a hard time imagining your particular difficulty, but I know I have my own peculiar foibles so that much I understand.<br><br>Idle musing: What would happen if you (and only you) did FV but asked "What should I do before X" instead of "What do I want to do before X" ?</div>

<div class="content">Nuntym:<br><br>I too have a hard time imagining your particular difficulty, but at one stage during development I was using the question "What is more urgent than x?". It wasn't anything like as effective for me, but it might suit your particular personality better.</div>

<div class="content">Nuntym:<br><br>thank you for your observations, please DO keep us updated.<br><br>your thoughts remind me of the subtle points of NLP, where it is shown in detail that how someone thinks about something changes the outcome. one method is to try and think the way someone else does that has a method of thinking which works better. such as you might actually try to change how your mind works. also, all of this gives us incentive to figure out how our mind works, as you have done, and realize that some things are just not changeable, and figure out how best to work with who we are. which you are doing.</div>

<div class="content">I experimented with a list processing algorithm similar to "Should I Start It Now" recently only I asked "When do I want to start this?"  My answer generally came back as one of the following levels of Urgency:  Already, Today, Tomorrow, In a few days, Soon, Later, Doesn't matter, and Never.  Note that these designations were not meant as a hard timeline I intended to follow, but rather a scale to measure how urgent a task felt to me.  As such a "Tomorrow" task could likely stay at that level of urgency for me for weeks before I began to lose interest and it dropped to "Soon," or even "Never."<br><br>I would delete "Never's" and dismiss "Doesn't Matter's," and "Later's" (to be reviewed at a later time).  "Already's" I would work right away until its Urgency dropped to a different level, and the other levels of Urgency I would just select via Colley's Rule (ie: I'd look for the next one with a higher Urgency and do that one). <br><br>SISN seems similar to my "Already" and "Today," but doesn't give you the opportunity to pre-emptively attack something that you'd like to start in the near future.  Also, the question I asked had "Want" in there rather than "Should" but I considering that I generally want to do those things that I should do (because I should do them) I often ended up rating things that I should do as having higher Urgency.<br><br>It worked out rather well for me, though when FV came out I've converted.  ;-)</div>

<div class="content">I agree. Tomorrow usually became <br>"To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,<br>Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,<br>To the last syllable of recorded time;"<br><br>That's one reason I like to record a history. Singing practice is less likely to be put of if I realize I've put it off seven days in a row.</div>
