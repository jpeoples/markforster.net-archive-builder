<div class="content">How could I combine FV with Mark's "Short Bursts" technique?<br><br>I just read Mark's book "Get Everything Done" and I'm very impressed with his "Short Bursts" technique (chapter 7 "How to Deal with Free-Flowing Items") and I wonder how could I combine this with the new FV.</div>

<div class="content">Theo:<br><br>I don't personally think it's necessary with FV. However if you have a particularly difficult task you want to get started on you might try giving it a timed burst of 5 minutes or so. That can be done without any extra props.</div>

<div class="content">Alan:<br><br>It's actually called "Timed Bursts". You work on a task for a timed burst of so many minutes, take a break from it, and then do another timed burst on the task. The book suggests a sequence of timed bursts of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 minutes, which should get you moving on just about anything. You are not recommended to go above 40 minutes.</div>

<div class="content">Mark, thanks for your response.<br><br>My biggest problem is Procrastination and lost of focus. It's a really big and life-threatening issue for me. That's why I was thinking about combining them.<br><br>Thanks</div>

<div class="content">Theo,<br><br>I guess the answer would be to bear in mind that you want to get through your first chain after adding the problem task in about ten minutes, including burst 1, when you do the selection. Next pass 20 minutes, next pass 30 minutes, next pass 40 minutes and so on up to 80 minutes, including the next burst in each pass.<br><br>Or you can simply pick two problems and have a single task: "alternate timed burst on A and B"which you work like any other task.</div>
