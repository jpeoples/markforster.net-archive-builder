<div class="content">I've just been reading "The How of Happiness" by Sonja Lyubomirsky. The author claims (supported by research) that most of our assumptions about what will make us happy are mistaken. <br><br>One of her findings is that only 10% of the variation in happiness is down to circumstances and situations while 40% is down to thinking and intentional behaviour. In her view you might say happiness is constructed rather than pursued - it's about behaviours and actions. That fits well with FV and "Dreams" for me!<br><br>Positive Psychology's correlational findings show humans seem happiest when they have<br><br>    Pleasures<br>    Engagement<br>    Social ties <br>    Meaning (a quest or belonging to something bigger)<br>    Accomplishments (having realized tangible goals).<br><br>Pleasure is the "feel good" part of happiness. Engagement refers to living a "good life"  balancing work, family, friends, and hobbies. Meaning refers to using our abilities to contribute to a larger spiritual or philanthropic purpose. <br><br><br>Many people base happiness on achieving a certain goal, on having certain things. The happiness that comes from these things is only temporary, and soon fades....and you still sense something is lacking, something is missing. You are not experiencing joy.<br><br>Engagement and meaning seem to make the most difference to living a happy life. These findings seem to me to contradict most people's assumptions about what makes people happy. It also  makes happiness a decision to implement thought and behaviours, more than the satisfaction of wishes for "stuff". <br><br><br><br><br>Implications for FV and happiness<br><br>Productivity as acquiring "stuff" is unlikely to have much impact on "well-being". Inatngible actions which are inner-focused are likely to give better happiness.<br><br>That seems to me a very empowering message, and one I'm using FV to implement more deliberately by putting some of her strategies into FV:<br><br>1. time for active appreciation - similar to Mark's "What's working?" question in "Dreams". I'm also using "Where am I already successful?"<br><br>2. cultivating optimism - positive stories and uplifting interpretations about what's occurring and how I'd prefer things to unfold<br><br>3. forgiving myself for less evolved attitudes and behaviours<br><br>4. cultivating relationships<br><br>5. acts of friendliness and kindness<br><br>(she has others but they don't appeal to me as much, or are already happening for me)<br><br>My hope is that by having these regularly on my FV list creating happiness becomes easier and producing "stuff" or consuming "stuff" gets the right significance.</div>

<div class="content">I like Ron Paul's definition of the "pursuit of happiness" (elaborating on Jefferson's statement in the American Declaration of Independence):   the freedom the pursue excellence and virtue.   That's where real happiness comes from.   A particular kind of "thinking and intentional behaviour".<br><br>I also like this definition because it's something most people can agree on -- a point of common ground for discussions on the meaning of life, the purpose of politics and government, fun stuff like that.   <br><br>I also like this definition because it is a rephrasing of classical patristic Christian notions on the topic, as often seen in the writings of Saint John Chrysostom.<br><br>FV does have a role here, since it is constantly calling upon your inner dispositions and attitudes when you answer that question, "What do I want to do before X?"</div>

<div class="content">I'm a Ron Paul fan too -and I'm in the UK! <br><br>I like to imagine that there is an invisible box at the top of the pre-select list which gives the inner outcome of satisfaction, fullfilment, peace of mind etc.</div>
