<div class="content">Let's get started...<br><br><br>SET UP YOUR LIST:<br><br>1. Create a new list in Clear.<br><br>2. Create a task with something like the following in it. Completely fill the task box so it fills one line only. This is your divider:<br><br>⊷⊷⊷⊷⊷⊷⊷⊷⊷⊷⊷⊷⊷⊷⊷<br>__________________<br><br>.....................................<br><br>------------------------------<br><br>••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••<br><br>******************************<br><br>Swipe this divider to the right to dim it.<br><br>3. Create another task with any of these questions inspired by Lillian and Seraphim from this post <a href="../fvp_forum/WANT or EASIER.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/fv-forum/post/1803934</a> and tap the spacebar a few times to place it in the center of the task box:<br><br>DO WHAT BEFORE X?<br>BUT FIRST, I'LL DO...<br>BEFORE X I'LL?<br>BEFORE X?<br><br>I prefer BEFORE X?.<br><br>Any of these will serve as a reminder of the Final Version question "What do I want to do before I do x?" while maintaining the emphasis on "Before" and are easily repeatable while scanning down your list.<br><br><br>HOW TO USE THE CLEAR METHOD:<br><br>1. Add your tasks by tapping in the black area at the bottom of your list.<br><br>Your list will look similar to this:<br><br><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/345611/Photos/Final_Version/IMG_9229.PNG" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/345611/Photos/Final_Version/IMG_9229.PNG</a><br><br>2. Build a chain by swiping the first task at the top of your list to the right. Your list will now look similar to this:<br><br><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/345611/Photos/Final_Version/IMG_9230.PNG" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/345611/Photos/Final_Version/IMG_9230.PNG</a><br><br>3. Continue scanning down your list and when you come to a task you want to do before your previous selection, swipe it to the right. <br><br>In the example list below I've chosen the last task on my list as the one I want to do before my previous selection. I swipe it to the right and it looks like this:<br><br><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/345611/Photos/Final_Version/IMG_9231.PNG" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/345611/Photos/Final_Version/IMG_9231.PNG</a><br><br>4. When there are no further tasks you wish to do before your previously selected task, touch the bottom of the screen where the iPhone trim meets the touchscreen, just above the iPhone home button to shoot to the bottom of your list.<br><br>You will now see a dimmed list of your preselected tasks and below that the divider you created earlier.<br><br>5. Beginning at the bottom of your dimmed list, swipe your dimmed divider to the right. Do the same for each bottommost dimmed task until all tasks are illuminated.<br><br>Your list will now look similar to this:<br><br><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/345611/Photos/Final_Version/IMG_9232.PNG" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/345611/Photos/Final_Version/IMG_9232.PNG</a><br><br>6. Swipe a task left to delete it when complete, or swipe it right to send it to the end of your list if recurring or incomplete. <br><br>To add new future tasks with an active chain, simply tap the black area at the bottom of your list, create your new task, and swipe it right to send it to the end of your list.<br><br>To add urgent tasks to your current chain, tap in the black area at the bottom of your list and create your new task. It will now be the first task in your chain.<br><br>7. When you have completed your chain and all its tasks are either dimmed or deleted, swipe the divider to the right to dim it as well. <br><br>8. Now send all your dimmed tasks to the end of your list. Swipe the bottommost dimmed task to the right and do the same for each bottommost dimmed task until all tasks are illuminated, but leave the divider dimmed. <br><br>You are now ready to add new tasks or create another chain.<br><br><br>That's it!</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Michael.<br><br>To clarify, are we operating now from top to bottom in Clear as opposed to the previous method from bottom to top? Conversely, the chain is now worked from bottom to top rather than top to bottom. Correct?</div>

<div class="content">Zack:<br><br>"...are we operating now from top to bottom in Clear..."<br><br>... Yes. Work your list the same as on paper. Start at the top, select the first task, continue scanning down the list. Top to bottom. <br><br><br>"...the chain is now worked from bottom to top... Correct?"<br><br>... Yes. Work your chain in reverse order. Bottom to top. Same as with a paper list.</div>

<div class="content">Fantastic. Thanks again, Michael, for your ideas and work implementing them. I look forward to seeing what you come up with in future version of Clear and I hope to be able to contribute even a fraction of what you have.</div>

<div class="content">TIP: If a task anywhere in your list suddenly becomes urgent, including any task in your current chain, simply swipe that task to the right to dim it and send to the bottom and swipe it right a second time to illuminate it and send to the front of your chain. Then do the task.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the new, very concise and excellent instructions. I've been using this system from the first day you posted them in the previous thread, and it really works like a charm. I think there is not much you can improve here. The only "tweak" I found that I don't need would be the "what before" item in the list. But I can see how this might be helpful for some people.</div>

<div class="content">Here's a terser summary of the steps:<br><br>0. Check that all tasks are brightened above dimmed divider at bottom.<br>1. Swipe-right to dim root task at top of list (and send it to bottom).<br>2. Swipe-right to dim one or more tasks going down the list, according to Question.<br>3. Swipe-right to brighten divider line (and move it above selected chain).<br>4. Swipe-right from bottom of chain going up. Everything is bright again.<br>5. Do chain bottom-up; swipe-left if finished/nonrecurring; swipe-right otherwise.<br>6. Swipe-right to dim divider.<br>7. Swipe-right from bottom up to brighten any unfinished/recurring tasks.<br><br>It makes sense, but is a little tricky to keep tasks in the right order. Remember to start the chain by brightening the divider, and end the chain by dimming the divider. Everything else is top-down preselection and bottom up working/swiping, very consistent with the paper-based procedure.</div>

<div class="content">Tersest:<br><br>0. Check entire list:  bright tasks above dim divider.<br>1. Dim root.<br>2. Dim top-down to build chain according to Q.<br>3. Brighten divider.<br>4. Brighten chain bottom-up.<br>5. Work bottom up.  (Dim-R or Delete-L.)<br>6. Dim divider.<br>7. Brighten bottom-up as necessary.</div>

<div class="content">I caved. <br>Had to try out FV, the Clear way. During work today, I walked all the way to the closest Coffee Bean just to get wi-fi and download Clear onto my Touch. (C.B.'s wifi was dog slow - even when I had my soy mocha in hand, it was still 50% downloading, so took a seat at a stool so as not to interrupt the download)<br>Tomorrow I'm going to start trying out FV with it.</div>

<div class="content">I have been using focus pad up until now and it works well.  Not much to fault although it would be nice to just see selected items.  Anyway I also thought I'd give clear a go out of interest.  I have to say it works well once you have spent a few mins getting used to the way it needs to be worked<br>Is quick, looks great and has that nice 'play' factor that makes it fun to use!<br>With a little work by the developer to make it a little more 'tuned' to FV and with the addition of tickler function and ability to move/ copy. Items between lists it could be perfect<br><br>Give it a go. It does work if used in the way described<br><br>I'm shall  continue with it for a while <br><br>Thanks</div>

<div class="content">Terserer:<br><br>1. Right-swipe first task at top.<br>2. Scroll down preselecting with right-swipe.<br>3. Right-swipe each dim task at bottom until all are lit.<br>4. Work chain bottom up. Left-swipe to delete. Right-swipe to send to end of list.<br>5. When only the divider remains lit, right-swipe it.<br>6. Repeat step 3, but leave the divider dim.</div>

<div class="content">Looks like some company called Nuage touch (New Age Touch?) is copying the Clear interface.  They've just gotten their Task app on the app store –<br><br><a href="http://appshopper.com/productivity/task-5" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://appshopper.com/productivity/task-5</a><br><br>– and posted a demo video –<br><br><a href="http://www.discovertask.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.discovertask.com/</a><br><br>– which reveals the blatantly copying, including swipe-right to check-off a task, and swipe-left to delete.  Their app seems to be a combined calendar/task-manager.  $0.99 currently.<br><br>Has anyone tried Task yet?</div>

<div class="content">ubi:<br><br>Tried it. Save your money.<br><br>• One task list.<br>• Delayed swipes.<br>• Swiping to check leaves tasks in place.<br>• Only way to get a task to the bottom is to move it there.<br>• No touch to the top or touch to the bottom of the list.<br><br>You could use the priority markers on the right of each task to dot your pre-selections and then you can scroll... and scroll... to get through your chain. You'll also need a quick eye or a slow scroll to spot the pre-selections. Next, you send those completed recurring or unfinished tasks to the end of your list by simply tapping each one, holding... then dragging each task to the bottom until you lose your mind and stab your phone with an ice pick.</div>
