<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">Since several of us have now been using FV for a few weeks, it's time for another poll question: <br>1. How many chains do you get through each day?  <br><br>Related question: <br>2. Do you strive to complete a chain by the end of the day, so that you start the next day fresh?<br><br>Inquiring minds want to know.<br><br>My answers:<br>  <br>1.  One to four.  <br>2.  Yes.</div>

<div class="content">2, and yes.  I think 3 would be better.</div>

<div class="content">I average about 57 tasks on my list with about 40% repeating.  I usually, in a full day, complete 3 to 4 chains of about 5-10 tasks each. <br><br>I try to finish each day, but don't fret too much if I don't.</div>

<div class="content">Around 3 chains per day (ranging from 1 to 4 or 5).<br><br>I don't attempt to finish the current chain by the end of the working day. No problem stopping in mid-chain. However, I notice that if I finished a chain close to the end of the day, I'm reluctant to start a new selection. So on some days, the end of a chain can influence my "ending time".</div>

<div class="content">It's interesting that no one so far has said he does anything like 10 chains or more in a day. (Perhaps those that do many chains don't waste their time contributing to this forum!)</div>

<div class="content">I typically do 1-3, sometimes up to 5.   <br><br>I think Mark does a lot more than that, if I remember right.</div>

<div class="content">I rarely carry chains over.  I would have said I normally do 2-3 chains a day, but the post about high resistance urgent tasks made me notice that today I did ~12 after lunch.  So I'm at 13 or so chains at the end of the workday.<br><br>The work list is artificially short and the chains are 3-4 tasks with my one high resistance urgent task in every chain.  I think I need to find a way to scan the list more quickly and keep my chains short.</div>

<div class="content">@ ubi: even though I have responded in a generic way, it is difficult to "compare" the responses.<br><br>Reason being: everyone has different tasks and different set ups work-wise. Furthermore, as Koske has pointed out, some might have very short chains and others longer ones …<br><br>Hence, we maybe should bring more structure to your question?</div>

<div class="content">1. One to three<br>2. Ideally yes, but I don't worry too much about it.<br><br>I do find that certain tasks draw me in for hours at a time, and I end up neglecting others (especially "routine maintenance" type tasks) that would only actually take a few minutes to complete. I've experimented from time to time with pomodoro or time-slice methods that limit how much time I spend on a given task, but haven't really found the right balance yet.</div>

<div class="content">I've been stuck on one chain for several days now.  Every morning, and maybe once more during the day, I need to clear email and inboxes and add to the list and re-select starting with the final dotted item.   And then work as far back up to the top of the chain as possible.<br><br>The main reason is I am at a very peak busy time on many different levels.   I expect it to settle down in about two weeks.
