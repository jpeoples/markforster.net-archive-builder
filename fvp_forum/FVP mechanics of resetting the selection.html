<div class="content">Anyone have any ideas for the best practical way to reset the selection on your list, when using pen and paper?   Scratching out the dots gets messy quickly.   LOL<br><br>I'd like to keep using a pen, and not need to carry around a pencil and eraser just for this.  :-)</div>

<div class="content">I dont know how you could avoid an eraser<br>There is a pencil which ink can be erased by a rubber or the pencil's rubber the pilot Frixion.<br><a href="http://www.rentreepleinciel.fr/catalogue/produit/9431008-pilot-roller-frixion-point-pointe-hightec-fine-sefface-a-la-gomme-en-bout-de-stylocoloris-violet" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.rentreepleinciel.fr/catalogue/produit/9431008-pilot-roller-frixion-point-pointe-hightec-fine-sefface-a-la-gomme-en-bout-de-stylocoloris-violet</a><br><br><br>For my self I use two pencils on black BIC and a papermate (graphite pencil) to make the selection <br><br>So when I need to re select I just all erase all dots with a rubber. It is fast and easy. I found it faster because of the difference of colors from grey to black. <br><br>I use a classic bic (<a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bic_Cristal)" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bic_Cristal)</a> it is the best tool I ever found. Cheap, nice, pleasant.</div>

<div class="content">I'm actually coming to the conclusion that one should re-prioritize only as a last resort. I kept yesterday's prioritization going today and found it works better. If something becomes urgent or needs getting on with, then it's best to cross it out and re-enter it at the end of the list, rather than upset what is quite a delicate balancing act by the algorithm.</div>

<div class="content">If you aren't erasing, it becomes certain that more and more marks will come up. The easiest means I can imagine is to mark with a slash / and unmark by making an X, yet obviously the oldest task can only take so many X's before runing out of room. <br><br>If we follow Mark's new suggestion, it seems to me imperative to have a 'review' task so as to become acquainted with those oldest tasks that might never get a second look otherwise.</div>

<div class="content">I'm not testing FVP yet, but it seems clear to me that the best way to "reset" is to take the same approach as in the original FV when a first task was not possible or the preselected list was obsolete - simply rewrite the preselected tasks and cross them out. Scribbling things out is going to get messy and make it more difficult to preselect. Besides, unlike in FV, it is not the intent of the FVP algorithm to pressure you to do the oldest tasks, so there is no benefit to leaving them where they were.</div>
