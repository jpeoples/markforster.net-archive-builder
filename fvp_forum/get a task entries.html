<div class="content">This will be hard to explain... but I'm sure I saw a comment in this forum, within the last 2 weeks, where someone alluded to a better way of formulating tasks by starting them with "Get a..."..<br><br>At the time I didn't pay much attention so I don't have more details. Darn.<br><br>But since that idea -- hopefully I didn't misread its import -- has started to give me a feeling this might explain why my task entries become stale - I quickly forget really why I considered the darn tasks important in the first place.<br><br>Anybody know what I'm talking about :) - I know this is so vague!<br><br>I think the commenter even linked to a location where the idea was explained in greater detail... so I'd love to find that.<br><br>Mark</div>

<div class="content">It doesn't matter why you considered it important in the first place. The important thing is whether it's important now or in the future. If it isn't, then delete it<br><br>(Pot calling kettle black, sigh. That's one of the nice features of those "on the fly" systems from earlier this month. All those tasks that are only around because I once thought they were important or interesting enough to write down don't get in the way.)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark P,<br><br>I must of missed this post. After about a month of use I suppose, how has the task phrasing worked for you? Good? Bad?</div>

<div class="content">"Get" phrasing is terrific. When the grammer sounds awkward (or manipulative), either live with it, or work out what your ultimate intentions or the results you're aiming for actually are, and you'll find a phase that is more natural.<br>I've concluded that alternatively attempting to work with a constrained list of action verbs is misguided. Furthermore, it is much easier to trace your eye down a list that begins with the object in mind and jolt your memory than it would if you started with the verb.</div>
