<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">I’ve been using FV for three days and it works great. Its combination of simplicity and power is astonishing. <br><br>However, a couple of times I’ve already found myself in a peculiar situation.<br>For example, I begin work in the morning and I discover that I need urgently to do something and want to do it, say I want to “Correct yesterday’s translation”. Suppose, for placing it in the worst of all possible worlds, that I have only a couple of hours, therefore I can get only two or three things done in this particular morning.<br>Intuitively, when this case shows, I have done what follows: I write immediately the task (“Correct translation”) at the end of my list, then select with a dot the first unactioned task on the list, then I go directly to the end of the list and preselect with a dot “Correct translation”. Then I begin to work, I correct the translation and after that I do the first task. End.<br><br>The problem is, in the scanning process I don’t look the rest of the list, because I know what I want to do next and I have a limited time.<br>And I don’t want to do anything more than I want to do “Correct yesterday’s translation”<br>Maybe I could have time for doing something else, but it is better for me to be sure that I finish the preselected tasks of this particular round.<br>If at the end I’ll have anyway that extra time, I could do a new preselection from the beginning.<br><br>What do you think? Is this a fair interpretation of the rule “the system is to help you to get your work done, not get in the way of doing your work”? Or you see any negative side effects, that diminish the great robustness and synergy of FV? <br>There is any reason that counsels to do the whole scanning in this concrete and exceptional situation, knowing that making so the ladder of task will be surely interrupted before completion, and we will never arrive to the first unactioned task of the list? (I think it’s very important to arrive there)</div>

<div class="content">I think you're placing a value on completing a chain within a session, which isn't part of FV.<br><br>Let's call the first unactioned task "A": and 'correct yesterday's translation' "Z"<br><br>It's always okay to just put Z at the end, dot it and do it. You could do that *before* making your preselection.<br><br>However, I wouldn't make 'A' and 'Z' my preselection without dong the scan, because you haven't made sure that the answer to 'what do I want to do before A?" is "Nothing but Z". You also haven't indicated that A is urgent (if it were, you could put it at the end, dot at do it once you've done Z. Which is, I know, what you're doing in shorthand, but in your process you haven't consciously thought about how urgent A is)<br><br>Of course, if you really value that motivating kick of completing a chain, then that will affect your preselection - but surely that isn't the *only* value affecting what you 'want'.<br><br>So, write Z, dot it, do it, then preselect.<br><br>John</div>

<div class="content">Miguel:<br><br>The rules cover this situation. If you have to get the translation done and you don't have much time to do it, then it qualifies as urgent. According to the rules, you can write it at the end of the list, put a dot against it and do it immediately. (If you have several tasks you need to do urgently, you can enter all of them in the same way).<br><br>Once you've done the task or tasks, you have a choice. You can either do the first task on the list immediately, or do a complete preselect. Unless the first task is urgent, the complete preselect would be best.</div>
