<div class="content">Sure. I still do it :)<br><br>But.<br><br>I trust and like this system. The best part of FV is that I'm able to combine the rules with any other system (in my case a variant of 7 Habits). I love that!</div>

<div class="content">I am just trying this out for the first time today. I had dabbled with Autofocus previously but let it go because I couldn't get a decent electronic set up. I did try using paper but it all got a bit difficult to maintain and I didn't like the idea of two notebooks as I need one for work, <br><br>This implementation is really simple and so far the rules really seem to help push on those tasks which normally I would avoid for ages. I don't know if it's just New System Syndrome but it's working like a charm so far.<br><br>Incidentally Mark, thanks for making this available for free. I would not have bothered checking it out if it had been a book. I think you will probably gain a whole bunch of new fans as a result.</div>

<div class="content"><<I think you will probably gain a whole bunch of new fans as a result. >><br><br>I agree. I think FV anxwers a huge question, one that 7 Habits and GTD fans continue to ask, which is: "Ok, everything is setup, now what?".</div>

<div class="content">Avrum,<br><br>I think the key for me is that to follow the system you have to deal with awkward tasks systematically at some point or abandon the method altogether. It seems to have at this point just the right mix of push-pull to encourage you out of procrastinating on stuck tasks. And the real beauty of this version is it's so simple.</div>

<div class="content">The system prevents procrastinating beyond a week, because the task you avoided reaches the head and you must make a decision about it. Of course you could do something meaningless to push it away, but I find when confronted with exactly one "what do you want to do with THIS", it breaks me out of the impasse.</div>
