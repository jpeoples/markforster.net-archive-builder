That's a good thing because I hold a view that Britain has never really 'recovered' (however one might define that) from WW1.

<div class="content">I am an executive recruiter with 25 years experience.  Solo office.  I have ADD. ( with meds). What-to-do-next can become paralysis without a reasonable and comprehensive system.   Because of the nature of my tasks, every call I make can result in 3 or more new calls to add to my list, which can lead to overwhelm. <br>   Mark's systems have all pointed me down a road of improved productivity.  I used Superfocus in a notebook.  It was very helpful.  <br>    I am now using FV in Evernote and am quite excited with the successes thus far. <br>    I have added one 'rule':  If I note a task (a task for me is usually an idea of a call to make and questions to ask) has become less urgent or relevant  but might be valuable later, rather than forcing myself to do it as FV discipline would have me do when it moves into the root position, whenever I realize a task anywhere on my list MAY not be relevant, I move it to another notebook named "Dismissed", which I review weekly. This keeps the exponential growth of my list in check, while saving the inspiration of the idea/task for possible use later.  Of course the developments of the day may make tasks become totally irrelevant in which case they are deleted on my first pass through the list each day.<br>  Also,as other entries have noted, a sense of accomplishment is good, so in my ToDo notebook, the items I tag "Do" per FV will have their Tag changed to X upon completion.  At the end of the day, I move all the X tagged items to another notebook named "Done."  Evernote's sorting capabilities make that "Done" notebook a handy reference to go back and see when I completed the task and what notes are included with it.</div>
