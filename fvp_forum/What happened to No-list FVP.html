<div class="content">Is anyone still using No-list FVP? How have they found it over time? I found that there was some attention on this system for a short while, and then it just seems to have disappeared from consciousness a little bit. I haven't seen any write-up discussing a sort of "post-mortem" analysis of the system and what worked and didn't work with it.</div>

<div class="content">I'd forgotten about No-list FVP. In fact I had to look it up to remind myself what it was.<br><br>I've also forgotten why it has disappeared into obscurity. <br><br>Reading the rules, it's a no-list system using the FVP algorithm. I think it must be the only FVP system which isn't based on a long-list. <br><br>I must have a try at it again to see what the problems were. But I won't do that until the Lent Challenge is finished. Not long now!</div>

<div class="content">I'd love to know when you start this and how long you intend to give it a go! I got curious because I've been going through many of the old systems, and this one has the advantage of addressing the "ordering" problem I had with 5/2 where I would always feel that the items I wrote down on my 5/2 list were out of order. I also was intrigued by the "sense of satisfaction at what I did in the day" that you claim about the system, since that's something I'm not sure I'm fully happy with right now.</div>

<div class="content">Well, I tried it last night, just before I went to bed and it worked like a dream dealing with a few minor points which weren't on my main list. It actually surprised me how quick and effective it was. Looking at the list I see that I did nine tasks in what couldn't have been more than ten or fifteen minutes.</div>

<div class="content">There are a couple of things which stood out for me when reading through the instructions:<br><br>1. That it's a good idea at the beginning of the day to start your list with the three or four most important tasks or projects that you want to do that day, making sure that you write them down in the reverse order that you want to do them. That then gives you a framework for the day.<br><br>2. Following on from that, you can use a project title to generate tasks related to that project. <br><br>So the list is rather more useful than just a few tasks scribbled on a bit of paper. You can use it to plan the major work subjects of the day and systematically work through what needs to be done for each of these subjects. While at the same time you can be getting minor unrelated tasks out of the way as they arise.</div>

<div class="content">Hrm, I'm considering trying this out after the Lenten challenge, as I think that GIRKIR is just proving to be a little too slow for me, and I'm coming to think that fast is most important to me, followed by flexibility, and last of all, by a long shot, is completeness. I think I'm probably organized enough, but it's more important that my system help me to increase focus, speed, and flexibility, and it strikes me that the no-list is probably a better approach for this as I can optimize for speed and flexibility rather than get bogged down with completeness, which I'm already naturally probably better at. I think I need to be producing more of the right things rather than covering more bases of lesser value. <br><br>This seems like a very interesting way to approach no-list, whereas what I am starting to conclude that GIRKIR is too good at balancing action over a wide range of items rather than letting me keep control of distractions and little sources of annoyance while putting the majority of my output into a few key, critical elements. I still have a few days to see if I can work that out with GIRKIR, though.</div>

<div class="content">Hi,<br><br>Long-time lurker, first time poster here. I’ve been on a Mark-Forster journey these past several months. I started with Autofocus, then really enjoyed Final Version Perfected, and now I’m trying No-List FVP. <br><br>(Thanks Mark, by the way, for everything you’ve shared here and in your books — I’ve found them valuable and transformative.)<br><br>But I agree with you Aaron, there never was a post-mortem on No-List FVP; I’d greatly appreciate hearing other people’s perspectives and if there are any problems they encountered using it. After about 10 days, I’m finding it a useful system. But it's so unlike everything else I’ve tried (I’ve used long-list systems for as long as I can remember) that it’s hard to assess it properly.<br><br>The main things that stand out to me about NL-FVP so far are:<br><br>- A feeling of "noise reduction"; less important tasks recede into the background, and my mind naturally goes to the big-picture important priorities. For better or worse, I feel unhurried and focused<br><br>- I haven't quite worked out the reminder system yet<br><br>- I feel more grounded in the present moment, instead of thinking about the long-list of tasks I haven't done <br><br>- I bias slightly more to doing tasks right away, because I don't have a list to put them on to return to later</div>

<div class="content">NL-FVP is probably one of my favorites of the no-list systems. The problem I had with other no-list systems is that I never got the ordering of tasks the right way round, or I never felt that I had enough room to "think" when I was writing. NL-FVP let's me think on the page a little more effectively and get to my next task without need the extra scratch paper, and it tends to be a little better about helping me to get to certain big things that I might be avoiding. However, eventually, as someone else noted, you will catch yourself procrastinating and you'll feel that rather intensely with NL-FVP. You'll have to be prepared to handle that somehow. <br><br>All no-list systems tend to be focused and "noise reducing" IME, over long list systems. In this respect, coupled with competent use of your calendar to ensure that you don't forget anything, they can have a truly calming effect, while still maintaining a satisfying degree of intensity and direction/purpose. The requirement, though, is making sure that you have yourself organized sufficiently that you can afford this luxury. If you're living life by putting out fires all the time, no-list will respond to this, but it might not help reduce stress that much if you feel pulled to bigger items and can't get to them. <br><br>I think it's much easier to remain in flow with no-list systems.</div>

<div class="content">Another favorite of mine is "Predicting Your Day." I currently use a variety of this with Time Surfing, by coming up with a "wish list" in the day for myself. NL-FVP lets you do this, too, by putting one or two things at the top of your list to drive your focus. <br><br>Both the predictive no-list and NL-FVP I think didn't get much of a post-mortem simply because I think they worked well, but weren't "fascinating" enough to warrant to much further discussion. In that respect, they might have been too effective. :-) <br><br>Sometimes, it's hard to have a system that literally seems to disappear into the background, because that gamification and extra work is a part of what we use at times to motivate our minds or distract us just enough from the work at hand. I think NL-FVP and Predicting Your Day (especially the latter), tended to be so minimalist that you really did end up just doing the work, and I honestly think that sometimes wasn't what people were looking for (myself included). Systems that introduce some level of psychological barrier between yourself and your work might have some added value here, depending on where one is in life.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Aaron - all good points, and thank you for sharing them! Yes, I agree that NL-FVP seems to disappear into the background very easily. That also means it brings you (general you) to face your procrastination; I’ve had a few moments where I’ve been confronted with this as a result of the system. I’ve also had one moment where I really had to think hard what I wanted to do next, but it was good to have the system force me to consider that.<br><br>I also observe that it is easy to forget to keep proper form with it - something that Mark has written is important.<br><br>Evaluating systems is difficult! It feels like it relies on a subjective assessment. That's no bad thing, I just observe that there's little objective assessment possible.</div>

<div class="content">An update to my NL-FVP experiment: Although I managed to keep up with the system for several months, I eventually went back to long list systems. <br><br>My main issue with NL-FVP is that it felt like I couldn't access the wisdom of my past self. If I'd done thinking in the past about the best way to attack a problem, or the best set of actions to accomplish something, I had to either hold that in my head or write it down somewhere and trust my present self to remember to work on it. NL-FVP felt like it severed this connection.<br><br>Also, I work in senior management, so there are lots of requests, meetings, deadlines, and so on. If I was working by myself or under few deadlines, I think NL-FVP could work well. But long-list systems seem to deal better with my work situation. Also, NL-FVP often forced me to work instantly on any incoming request, no matter whether that was the right time to get to them; with long-list systems, I can transfer incoming requests to the long list and trust that I'll get to the request at the right time.<br><br>After switching off NL-VP, I tried FVP with a change to the formula. After pre-selecting my list, I would ask myself, "Is there anything I want to do before this last pre-selected task?" Essentially this is FVP but with the NL-FVP question tacked on. I had mixed results, but that might be because I wasn't completely disciplined with that approach. It was essentially an attempt to get the best of no-list and long-list. I will probably revisit that approach, because I do think there's something to be said for it. I do still employ a no-list approach on occasion when I feel like I need to cut through the noise.<br><br>I'm currently trying Re: Zero!</div>

<div class="content">I use No-List FVP, perhaps several times a week.  I use mainly a long list, but use a no-list for a change when I get tired of the long list, maybe for a 15 minutes, 30 minutes, hour, or a session. <br>Perhaps these uses could be called a dynamic list - but I use a no-list for preparing a meal, packing to go somewhere, preparing for a meeting.  The items on these lists are short-term, will be completed soon, and so don't belong on the long list. The FVP is useful when I need to do the items in a particular order; also if I need to do everything on the list.  Sometimes I write the no-list on a separate piece of paper, such as a 5 by 8 index card, or loose leaf paper; other times I put it at the end of the long list if I think the items will be done again.  <br><br>Another alternative of course is not to use a list at all.</div>
