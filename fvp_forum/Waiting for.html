<div class="content">Just out of interest - how do you guys handle 'waiting for' items - i.e. you are waiting for feedback/info from a customer/other person?  Some of my waiting for items aren't always time  based so it's easy to forget about them! Is there a way I could use FV to deal with these?</div>

<div class="content">Just put "W" in the marge on the left of the item. If it is something actionable soon<br>If it is not put it either on agenda nor on Omnifocus or whatever (Other software, tickler ....)</div>

<div class="content">I've always put my waiting fors on the same AF/SF list and find it works well on Day 1 of FV.<br><br>A waiting-for is one of two things, either you get what you are waiting for, in which case in the course of going through the preselection you can delete it, or you need to actively remind someone that you are still waiting for it, in which case it will end up being a preselected item, presuming it is something you want more than the preceding preselected task.<br><br>Make sense?</div>

<div class="content">For me it would depend on how many I had to track. If I had less than a double handful I'd just add them to the list and process them normally. If more I'd create a separate list to track them on and then put Check Follow-ups on my list.</div>

<div class="content">Email is a nice medium for coordinating with AF.  You process incoming messages when you get to the Waiting-For item.  And then you send your reply.</div>

<div class="content">I put them at the end of my list. It will take a while until they become the 1st unactioned item. Meanwhile, I remember them when reviewing. If it will be a very long time before I need to take action, I might put them in a tickler file, or on the next page in the book, just so I don't see them all the time.</div>

<div class="content">The advice that I got when I first came here still suits me quite well. Start the task with the number of times you've reminded someone and the date you last reminded them. So:<br>(2 - 3/13) Bob re: Project X<br>That tells me that I've spoken to Bob twice, the second time was today.<br><br>As you process the list, that date will start driving you to follow up again as appropriate. If the item becomes the "oldest unactioned item" (the "first unactioned item on the list") and it's too early to talk to Bob again, just rewrite it at the end of the list.</div>
