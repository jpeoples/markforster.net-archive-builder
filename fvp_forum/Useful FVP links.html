<div class="content">Thanks for that, Seraphim - much appreciated.<br><br>I've not yet had a chance to give FVP or FVP-Q a proper trial, but I'm going to start it this week.  I'd lost the notebook containing my Someday/Maybe list and have been hunting for it all week, because some of the tasks are things I want to do in the next couple of months but I couldn't remember all of them.  Now that I've found the notebook, I'll transfer those tasks to my current working notebook.  My current working notebook is actually a diary for 2015 which started life in January as DIT, but since then has been reincarnated as AF1, FV, 3-tasks, SMEMA, etc. etc., according to how I felt at the time (I love them all!).  <br><br>My working notebook was getting bunged up with someday/maybe tasks so I thought it would be better to transfer them to a separate notebook - now I'm not so sure - it's handy to have everything in one place, but the list becomes unwieldy, especially because I process the list using various systems of Mark's.  <br><br>I know I'd be much better off just choosing a system and using it consistently!  So your summary of all the various posts on FVP is very timely - I'll read them all to get my head round it.</div>

<div class="content">Lenore:<br><br>Thanks for asking. I've just realized I did it as a tag, not a category. <br><br>You'll see it at the bottom of any blog post about FVP in red. Click on it and it will bring up all the other blog posts about FVP. Unfortunately it only works with blog posts not with Forum posts.</div>
