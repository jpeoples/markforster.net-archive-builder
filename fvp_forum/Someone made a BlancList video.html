<div class="content">This video was a good overview, though he didn't explain how to add new tasks (go to the bottom of the screen). I'm trying BlancList again now that it has improved some since I last tried it. I like very much how it helps you focus on just one task at a time, by putting it in big letters on your screen; in conjunction with my favorite pomodoro webapp (mytomatoes.com), I am enjoying doing things with this online tool.</div>
