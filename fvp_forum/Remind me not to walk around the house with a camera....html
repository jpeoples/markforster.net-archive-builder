<div class="content">I just added 100 tasks to my list!   So many things to clean up, put away, fix, build, discuss...   <br><br>I am sure FV will handle it just fine.  :-)</div>

<div class="content">Re-reading this post, I realized it is rather opaque.   So here is an explanation.<br><br>Basically I was going around taking photos of all the things that need attention around the house and yard.   Then, back at the computer, I downloaded all the photos to the computer, and pulled them into OneNote, writing a few words for each one about what needed to be done.   Now all these tasks that have been niggling at me whenever I walk around the yard, are finally on my list.   Which means they will probably actually see some action sometime soon!<br><br>I really liked how this worked, because it was a LOT faster than going around and writing everything down, then copying those notes onto my FV list in OneNote.   And the photos themselves are also now in OneNote together with the tasks, giving me all the visual details I need to remember what the task was all about.   It will even help me buy the right color of paint for the porch railings!  :-)</div>

<div class="content">I handle this sort of thing by only putting the urgent or critical or complicated things on the list.<br><br>The rest is part of "round -- garden", or "rounds -- house". "Rounds" means walk around and do anything that will take under 5 minutes then and there. If no 5 minute tasks, look for longer tasks. It always amazes me how good the house or yard looks after 20 minutes of random work, with the emphasis on things you can finish in one session (including putting things away).<br><br>I found putting too many shortish things on the list overwhelmed it. I had too many things started (and left a the messiest stage). Yes, FV says that thinking, "This task will be one too many plates spinning, I want to finish a few before starting this one," is enough action to rewrite it, but when you hit 100 tasks in a row, it's a lot of rewriting.<br><br>The photo idea is good, though. It's a fast way of recording a lot of information.</div>

<div class="content">Yes, Cricket, generally I agree with you.   But forty 5-minute items take over three hours to complete, and the other 60 were more complex.   Lots of these items were just waiting for me to put them on a list so I could make sure they got done.   :-)</div>

<div class="content">Three hours, at an average of 15 minute a session, is 12 sessions.<br><br>I find it's faster to just do quickies, rather than write them down and evaluate them. You can also do Colley's Rule during rounds. The first thing you see is the benchmark. Usually, though, whatever stands out is a good enough place to start. Five minutes to do now, or one minute reminder / justification / frustration / self-chastisement every time I think about it -- which adds up.<br><br>The only time a quickie goes on my list is if I'm avoiding it -- which admittedly happens a lot.  If I need incentive to do rounds, I might write out what's on my mind. Sometimes I just do that task (or a few selected tasks), but other times I keep working at whichever quickie stands out as long as I want to rather than run back to the list every five minutes.</div>

<div class="content">When I have lots and lots of quick tasks like this, I put them on the list, otherwise they get forgotten - out of sight, out of mind.  <br><br>A key advantage of this:  I become far more aware of these things by seeing them on my list.  I might realize, for example, that I have 15 small things I need to do in the yard.   So, when I need to take a break from the computer, I naturally gravitate towards spending 15-20 minutes outside, with one or two particular tasks in mind, and I end up taking care of several other items while I'm there.<br><br>If I DON'T put those things on my list, when I take a break I'd most likely stare out the window for 10 minutes, or make some coffee or something.   <br><br>Sometimes I might put "lots of things to do in the yard" on my list, rather than each individual thing.   But I find the details help draw my attention and get my subconscious working on it.  The summary item doesn't grab me as much.<br><br>What's really nice is FV can accommodate all these different styles of working.</div>
