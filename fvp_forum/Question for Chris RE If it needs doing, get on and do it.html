<div class="content">Brent said he does PM and is an IT professional and asks for thoughts.  This is a wide area covering a huge range of skills and roles.

Your hypothetical doomsday scenario indicates some problems in how this company manages its customer commitments and a project manager who is either really poor (in which case their projects will fail repeatedly with this level of apalling planning) or terribly unlucky today (in which case the solution is communication, pulling in additional resource, delegating other jobs and utilising buffers which should have been worked into the timelines, and likely learning lessons in scoping for future projects).<br><br>By "get on and do it" I'm highlighting that in the IT profession, especially in a role where you touch a number of parts of the business you will find endless distractions to stop you doing anything.

<div class="content">Thanks for the reply Chris and Serahim to this and the other thread.  I appreciate the acknowledgement by you and Seraphim that the IT environment can have a lot of additional distractions due to the nature of customer support.  It is definitely something that many struggle with.<br><br>It is true that some days can feel like something is going to detonate in 15 minutes and it doesn't matter how well we planned the week.  I actually feel more clarity in those moments because I can see it should be my top focus.  The times I struggle the most however, is when I have a lot of requests coming in that are small and easy but due to volume get quite onerous.  My team and I do pretty good with the "big rocks" but sometimes *feel* that there is so much "sand" blowing around that we are soon to be buried in a dune.  <br><br>For these times, I find it very helpful to simply create a list.  It is very clarifying.  It is obviously why I'm drawn to this site and most recently the FVP algorithm of how to deal with the list you just made.  <br><br>Having said that,  in a day to day hour to hour process, I'm aware that just how big that list really is and if there isn't a detonation in the next 15 minutes, I sometimes wonder, if I should I buckle down on a big rock or should I clear out some of this sand.  Despite what Stephen Covey and others say about doing the big rocks first, I have found that if you don't "sweep" the sand away often, you will be buried quickly.  It is easily to get a little stuck in the day not knowing what to focus on based on time, energy and resources available. <br><br>The question that I ask myself in that situation was the topic at hand and I was debating between whether I should ask myself "What do I want to do next", What should I do next" or "What will I do next"<br><br>I'm leaning toward the final question of "What will I do or start next?" simply because it evokes the feeling of the determination "get on and do it" that Chris mentioned but also by asking the question while looking at my list proves that I'm in control of what I'm choosing rather than the more reactive latest and loudest approach that is so easy to fall into in our profession.<br><br>Brent</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim this is my take, uninformed by any particular expertise and feel free to ignore it. <br><br>The situation you describe seems to me to be unmanageable and unsustainable by any time management or other system. It looks to me as if it would lead to physical or mental illness at worst or severe burnout at best. It looks to me as if the organization is dysfunctional. <br><br>I forget the book where I read this analogy but it was somewhere among the reading I did for a course I teach on creative thinking. We spend part of the semester talking about stress and its effects and about time management and also about working in and with teams. This analogy is relevant to all those topics:<br><br>If you think of a work system as a colander or sieve, when the demands of the system increase you can either grind yourself finer and finer (do more and more, usually with less and less) to get through the holes or make the holes larger. The first response has the advantage that it's safe and anyone can do it. But only for "a while" as you approach ineffectiveness or burnout. The second response means that you work to change (humanize, improve) the system. It has risks of failure or firing and requires administrative buy in and takes a lot of energy.<br><br>I've changed some systems in my work career. I've also ground myself down into nothing, until I made the decision to walk away--a decision I almost always delayed too long.<br><br>"Work" does not have to be as unbalanced and unsustainable as what you describe. <br><br>(On a side note, I was puzzled that you increased the stress of your work day by running errands and checking in with family. When I had high stress jobs (or high stress periods) I didn't run errands during work. My children contacted me if there was an emergency. I checked in with my spouse at the end of the day. )</div>

<div class="content">I find it's important to not let new things coming in interrupt what I'm doing if I can help it because there's an additional cost of switching supporting material to deal with different things.  It's present in all things but if someone is moving from one task to another it's handled automatically and so not noticed, but enforced moving between unrelated things really highlights it.<br><br>In IT, and in a role with a number of touch points in the business with constant interruptions, the cost of moving different supporting material in and out of view, in order to deal with each one, can snowball and start eclipse the tasks themselves.  Hence queuing stuff on a list and staying on what you're on until some sensible checkpoint where you can easily pick it up again, if you're able to, is preferable.<br><br>Chris</div>

I also work in IT as a product manager.  I've been doing related work for 20+ years.   I'm saying this only to establish that we are talking about similar contexts.<br><br><br><< Your hypothetical doomsday scenario >><br>It wasn't hypothetical, and it wasn't doomsday.  This was basically my day, yesterday (which I had already described here:  <a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/fv-forum/post/2514204#post2535085" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/fv-forum/post/2514204#post2535085</a> ).  The numbers I used were from yesterday.  I grant that it *was* an extraordinary day, but I've had plenty of other days like that one.  It wasn't a "doomsday" scenario.  With FVP I felt quite on top of it.   It was still stressful and draining, but at the end of the day I felt quite satisfied with how it all worked out.  I don't think I've been able to say that for a very long time, for a day like that -- not with AF, or DIT, or iDoneThis, or my own ad-hoc whatever systems, or anything else I've tried.<br><br><br><< indicates some problems in how this company manages its customer commitments >> etc.<br>Of course it does.  I agree there are overall organizational and management issues at the root cause of many of these issues.  And at least 2 or 3 of those 20+ tasks I worked on yesterday were directly related to solving those root cause issues.   And as long as those root causes remain, it's just the reality I deal with.   I am certainly not alone.<br><br><br><< By "get on and do it" I'm highlighting that in the IT profession, especially in a role where you touch a number of parts of the business you will find endless distractions to stop you doing anything. >><br>I agree with you.  But I don't think there was anything I worked on yesterday that would fit into that "distraction" category, except perhaps posting here.  :-)    (But I come here for a mental break -- it helps me take a step back from the actual fray and come back with a fresher perspective.)<br><br><br><< So once you've determined that something does need doing, knuckle down and get it done. Get off email, Lync, mute phone, get busy. >><br>That doesn't work for me.  There is too much to do that all wants attention.  All of it is important (to somebody, at least).  I've got to find the right balance between what is really important for ME to do, what's best for the business, what's best for my team, is the management request really needed or does somebody just need to check a box on a form.  I need to be able to figure out what "good enough" is -- and that changes depending on the conflicting priorities.   "Just get it done" begs the question -- WHAT to get done, and to what degree?<br><br><br><< You're massively over-analysing, which will cripple you. >><br>Granted, that can be crippling.  But I've tried the "just get it done" approach.  There *is* great value there.  "Do It Tomorrow" and any "closed list" system has this at its core:  the Will Do list, for example.   I used that for a long time, and it was very simple and helpful.  It is very helpful for getting realistic about one's commitments.   But it isn't adequate for the kind of situation I am describing, which is unfortunately very common in the modern world.  <br><br><br><< In medical trauma response, … there are loads of algorithms to cover trauma situations >> etc.<br>Yes, triage / "simple rules" are great, I try to use them myself all the time:  email, user requests, etc.<br><br><br><< you snipped most of what I wrote in that first bullet and quoted it out of context >><br>I actually didn't think I had done that, but I apologize if you feel I've misrepresented you.</div>

Using a different question to nudge the "standing out" process in the right direction really gives me total control over what I'm doing.  It helps me find the right things to focus on:  quickly and effectively.   It's very simple and very low overhead.   It also eliminates the resistance to the hard stuff -- or greatly reduces it.</div>

For example, I've never before heard a VP-level manager in IT able to articulate how too much WIP paralyzes an organization and reduces its ability to get things done, and actively advocates (and practices himself) reducing WIP.  And it's not just talk -- our whole org has been restructuring reporting structures and workgroups so we can be effective with an Agile Scrum model.  Besides allowing our development teams to really focus, this also makes it plain and clear where we are overcommitted, and forces us to make the hard decisions to address it.   Days like yesterday show that we still have work to do (!) but these kinds of changes are really encouraging and help keep me motivated.<br><br><br><< (On a side note, I was puzzled that you increased the stress of your work day by running errands and checking in with family. >><br><br>The errands were pretty important - taking vehicle to get repaired; picking it up at end of day; picking up books and supplies for my kids who are starting college this week.   Deferring these would all have high negative impact.   And it's important to my family and me that I check in a few times per day.  :-)</div>

I keep a spreadsheet of things I'm working on so I can remember where they're up to and update it periodically, but that's just because I get them mixed up in my head and also want to track commercials (which also eliminates the need for a separate forecasting sheet, the "touch once" principle).<br><br>Anyway it's all food for thought isn't it.

The point I have been trying to make about FVP is that it does what it does with very low overhead, allowing me to focus on the work itself.   FVP itself just sort of fades into the background.   I've never used a work method that is so effective, so simple, and so unobtrusive.   It just lets me think and focus and get things done.<br><br>And if I have neglected to say it before:  Thanks for the discussion, Chris!   :-)</div>
