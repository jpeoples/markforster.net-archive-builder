<div class="content">I'm not sure if this has already been talked about. But, I have been flying through backlogs of email using a great web app called 'the email game'. <br>I'm not affiliated with them, but really wanted to share it with others that get annoyed going through tons of email. <br><br><br>The email game can be found here:<br><a href="http://emailga.me/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://emailga.me/</a><br><br>The video is pretty quick and describes the gist of it. It makes getting through emails very enjoyable and fast. <br><br>The site has lots of features similar to an autofocus for email  feel. That is, you can skim through a backlog of email, work on it little and often, boomerang (kind of like postpone or ignore the emails not ready to be done), archive and lots of other cool features. <br><br>I highly recommend giving it a try.  It is definitely a task I always look forward to adding to my ladders for FV.  I think it is just for gmail users though, not sure. Again, check it out. </div>
