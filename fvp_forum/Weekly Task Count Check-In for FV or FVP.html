<div class="content">Zane:<br><br>It's a benchmark of how many active tasks are on your list right now, and how many active pages there are if using paper. A week from the date of your latest benchmark post, check in again with a fresh update. I posted my first benchmark on Monday, so I will check in next Monday with new totals.</div>

<div class="content">Michael B<br>I can't imagine having 264 tasks open. Honestly I don't think I could come up with 250+ things to do, so we must be approaching our lists very differently. Would you say a little bit about your list, your methodology?</div>

<div class="content">Zane:<br><br>I don't pre-filter what I write down when using a "universal capture" system. I write down anything that occurs to me to do or think of doing. When Mark creates a universal capture system, I've noticed a tendency for many to continue pre-filtering what they write down. For one's universal capture list to be 20-30 tasks long during the course of a week, I can only imagine one must be:<br><br>• Pre-filtering what's written down<br>• Writing many tasks large instead of broken down smaller<br>• Managing a lot of tasks in their head<br>• Possibly using the list only for work related tasks, writing them large, and managing a lot in their head</div>

<div class="content">10 pages<br>80 tasks<br>"No question" FVP<br><br>A couple of remarks:<br><br>The most important task on my list is "Weed List".<br><br>Keep an eye on the oldest tasks on your list:<br><br>If they are low priority tasks which you are not particularly concerned about, then there is no problem. They are exactly where they should be if the algorithm is working correctly.<br><br>If they are important tasks which you are resisting, then you are not working the algorithm correctly. In which case the action you take can include: 1) reducing the number of tasks you chose on each pass; 2) aggressively weeding the list; 3) crossing out the earliest tasks and re-entering them at the end of the list - but only if you consider it still important to do them.<br><br>It's important to remember that FVP does not work like AF1. AF1 forces you to do, dismiss or delete every task which you enter on the list. FVP on the other hand produces an optimal order for doing the tasks. This means that if you have more work on the list than you are capable of doing, you will never get round to doing certain tasks.<br><br>The result of all this is that FVP, if done properly, will produce less trivial and/or unimportant action than AF1. The FVP user does what matters when it matters. The AF1 user does it all, regardless of what really matters at the time.</div>

<div class="content">"The AF1 user does it all, regardless of what really matters at the time."<br><br>I'm can't say that this is how AF1 works for me. I write down things in my list that I think I should do, that I want to do, that I want to think about, that I don't want to forget, that I have to do, etc.<br><br>As I cycle through the list, I do, dismiss, or delete them. When needed, I invoke the rule "If it needs doing now, do it now." It is easy to jump out of the list to take care of whatever has become pressing for whatever reason knowing that you won't forget everything else or break the system by doing so.<br><br>Items that I decide I'm never going to do, I delete immediately. Some items get dismissed so I can review them later. No worries.<br><br>The work gets done and has a flow to it. AF1 really works well for me at this point in my life.</div>

My task list has just about doubled and I'm much more drawn to using it than before, more reliant on it. Why? The position I had the last several years had clear-cut weekly, monthly, and quarterly "benchmarks" that, after years of experience, I didn't need many reminders for. Now I have many unique tasks and I'm relying on the list to both remind me of what to do and to help me prioritize properly. The list has a whole different feel to it and it plays a much more important role.</div>

<div class="content">"Also, my notebook is really quite worn -- FVP just chews it up."<br><br>I don't think that's a good thing because it implies you're investing a lot of time dealing with the notebook itself, time which could be invested in doing things. This admin cost was touched on in the algorithms discussion and your description seems to bear it out.  Do you know how long you're spending in there?  It would be interesting to monitor.  It would take me a couple of days non-stop to fill a notebook, let alone cause it to become worn.<br><br>Chris</div>

<div class="content"><< it implies you're investing a lot of time dealing with the notebook itself, time which could be invested in doing things >><br><br>That really hasn't been my experience.  The only thing I find a bit time-consuming, is sometimes when I am starting a new series of dots (after having completed all, or nearly all, of the previously dotted items).  It can take some time to read through and engage with the items on the page, letting them mentally register in my mind.  This doesn't have an administrative, mindless, overhead kind of feel to it.   There's more to it than that.  It's really worth the time.  It's *thinking time* -- time to assess priorities and get re-focused after having just finished up the last set of things.  <br><br>As such, it's one of the more valuable things I can spend my time on.   What makes it really easy, is that this is just built into the algorithm for processing the list (at least when using a flexible "standing out" method and the "dotting power" principles).<br><br>I think the list gets chewed up so much simply because things are getting completed so fast -- for example, right now my last active page has 3 active tasks, 15 completed tasks, and 12 empty lines waiting to be filled.  So you can see that even the newest page already has plenty of writing and cross-outs.   This makes the whole notebook feel "well-used".</div>

<div class="content">I agree that the rapid notebook consumption is NOT a bad thing. For me, it has a lot to do with the crossing-out/rewriting of tasks that are being actioned in small but frequent increments. And the tasks that are getting added and finished quickly.<br><br>I found out the hard way that the FVP algorithm doesn't work nearly as well if you don't cross out an in-progress item and rewrite it at the end of the list each time you've taken action on it. (Unless it's already pretty close to the end.) Keeping items on their original pages over time also tends to increase the number of active pages you have to flip through to get through your whole list; that's annoying. At that point, you'll want to consolidate them anyway.<br><br>Also, I'm not sure about Seraphim, but I maintain the list on the right-hand page only. The left pages are for supplemental notes. And some pages get written on and given to other people, etc. That speeds up notebook consumption too. <br><br>I mean, I REALLY am using just one notebook at a time.<br><br>I believe I'd do roughly the same amount of note-taking and list-making with any other system, even if I organized the material differently. And when I had no formal system at all, I took far more notes and made far more lists - redundantly and inconsistently. It wasn't obvious, because I didn't keep them all in one notebook. They were scattered in various locations, and were frequently misplaced. I still run across an old list from time to time; it's horrifying.<br><br>So, yes, it might be a bit alarming at first to see how fast a notebook can get used up. But it's only one notebook at a time. And all that scribbling represents freed-up processing power and memory inside my head.</div>

I made the change because I had observed I didn't need as many side notes with FVP -- ideas, notes, and actions could all go straight onto the list, and get handled really well.   I have less and less need for separate notes, unless I want to preserve the record of a conversation or something like that, and then I use a separate sheet in the back of the notebook.</div>

<div class="content">FVP<br>No Question (unless I happen to find it useful at the moment)<br><br>377 tasks (net increase of 84 tasks or 29%)<br>43 pages (net increase of 14 pages or 48%)<br><br>Average days to close each page = 17.7 days<br><br>These last seven days have been extraordinarily busy, returning from a business trip, LOTS of follow-up tasks, a lot of follow-up meetings which generated their own new tasks, and kickoff of a new project; and at home, the school year started back up this week, we needed to deal with several problems with vehicles, and a few other minor emergencies.  I've stayed very focused on the urgency and changing priorities, but cycled back to the beginning of the list only once, spent almost no time on the earlier pages, and did not close out any pages (although several have only 1-2 tasks left).   <br><br>My final assessment is that is was a very productive and focused week.  I feel pretty exhausted but actually don't feel overwhelmed, rather I feel almost exhilarated at how much I got done, and how much I felt on top of things.   I think a great deal of this is attributable to FVP - so thank you again, Mark!</div>

<div class="content">I junped to paper.  40 tasks over 3 pages. FVP, question varies with mood.  I wonder, how many things on your list will keep getting acted on but never deleted?  I suspect about half of mine are perpetual tasks.</div>

I'd do this by making the other tasks more generic. So the one-off tasks would be a separate Inbox for "One-Off Tasks", which would be dealt with on an inbox zero basis like email. Instead of "Glossika French Fluency 2" I'd put "Current Language Course", instead of "At Lady Molly's" I'd put "Current Novel".

<div class="content">Mark discussed the new question somewhere around here.  Stillness is meant in the Christian sense, as in "Be still and know that I am God", and is related to inner peace.  It doesn't mean inaction, but does mean that all your desires and activities become aligned with your beliefs and God's will.  And, therefore you can rest (be at ease, not idle) in God's promises rather than struggle to your own capabilities.  "in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose."</div>
