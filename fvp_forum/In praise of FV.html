<div class="content">I have been a long time lurker here and tried a few of Mark's systems (AF4 first, then SF then the AF1 variants) before FV -and I just LOVE it.<br><br> Someone referred to the other systems like flashing a light around a dark room and FV like knowing what is in the room (something like that - apologies to the person who wrote it so eloquently) - it is just fabulous feeling like I am doing exactly the right thing when I need to be doing it with the flexibility to add onto the end of the list when I need. <br><br>I am a SAHM (mostly) and I alternate between short periods of being able to work the list with longer periods of organized chaos (e.g.  when the kids come home from school and it is into the routine) but still with FV I can have the list in existence and add the most urgent of the routine tasks on the end - in the past I have gone off list and then gone waaaay off list and a few days later (or weeks) come back to my list. FV is a system that I can really trust!<br><br>Thank you Mark!!!!!</div>

<div class="content">Kerry:<br><br>Here is the full text of the quote you referenced:<br><br>"I also like breezing over the full list because it makes me fully aware of everything on my plate. AF/SF felt to me like my whole list was a dark room, and I would use a flashlight to methodically scan the floor, ceiling, and each wall over and over again. If I heard a noise in one corner, instead of just pointing my flashlight in that direction, I had to speed up my methodical scan so that I could reach the part of my scan where I illuminated that corner. It was frustrating. <br><br>Reading the full list during FV’s preselection feels like flipping on a light switch in the dark room. By preselcting my tasks, I can focus my attention on anything in the room I choose, at the time that I choose, rather than having to rush my methodical scan. At the same time, it feels as though I’m at least peripherally aware of everything else going on in the room, rather than being “in the dark” when I hear a sound in the corner. The “numbing/blinding” effect you describe feels like the light in the room is a single bulb dangling from the ceiling. It illuminates the things I’m close to (psychologically ready for), but casts deep shadows around the periphery further away from me (psychologically not ready for), highlighting with darkness those areas of my list which I must explore with the flashlight of review."<br><br>— Miracle, March 30, 2012 at 17:02</div>

<div class="content">I love FV too. I use it with GTD. It is my inbox (I do it on a small spiral notebook) and process with the FV rules. <br><br>Let's see an example. <br>1. I am overwhelmed by interruption and new information. Where do they go ? In my FV list. I will treat them asap and stay concentrate on what I do. <br><br>2. Then when it is finished I read FV list treating it with MF rules. I work little by little and very fast. I Highline what I want to do  before and everything goes on fast. <br><br>3. Then arriving at the end of the list imagine that there are some tasks I am reluctant to do. They are high lined most often or not. So I cross them and report them on my context list. <br><br>4. I take my context list and treat it how ? with MF rules of course !<br>If I cant do it now and I am reluctant to do it again it is planned in my diary. I will do it as an appointment.<br><br>5. If I need to work on a project I take the project and it work on it with GTD way. Brainstorming and so on. Tasks goes either on my FV list, nor context list, nor in my diary (ie deadlines)<br><br>So I Do a constant ping pong from my projects - context and FV list and it is easy for me. <br><br>FV does what I must quickly do, Context list what I am reluctant to do, and project manage the all system. FV is an essential part of the GTD's control part.It  free me for thinking on the perspective part. But the most important thing is that I feel really quiet in my mind. I am productive and efficient. <br><br>I am working like this since a couple of months. It takes me a long time to understand how FV and GTD could work together. But now I have found a killer system which realy works for me. <br><br>Thanks to Mark Forster and David Allen<br><br>Nb. I am implanting a little part of covey too but it is not ready to share with you.</div>

<div class="content"><< If I heard a noise in one corner, instead of just pointing my flashlight in that direction, I had to speed up my methodical scan so that I could reach the part of my scan where I illuminated that corner. It was frustrating. >><br><br>The rules for AF1 state: "DO use common sense. If something comes up which needs doing immediately, do it immediately."  It doesn't say to hurry up the methodical scan until you get there.  All the other Autofocus variants inherit this common-sense rule too.<br><br>Also, I might point out that (1) nothing in the Autofocus rules discourages you from reviewing the full list whenever you like to remain familiar with "what's in the room" and (2) if you have anything on your mind that needs doing, you don't need to wait to come across it in your scan, just add it to the end of the list and do it if you want.  You can eliminate the duplicate later.</div>

<div class="content">That's why I prioritize things. Priority, to me, means "don't forget", not "do before anything else". If I'm happy with the state of everything on my priority list (which includes not happy but thoroughly sick of everything on it), I can safely work on other things..</div>

<div class="content">I guess I view priority as "don't forget, and do sooner than later", but not necessarily "do before anything else"...</div>
