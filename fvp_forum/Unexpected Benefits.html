<div class="content">This is the third time the system has forced / encouraged / allowed me to do something I very much wanted to do, but kept putting off because they were guilty pleasures. Eventually, even guilty pleasures work their way to the top of the list. I need that encouragement.</div>

<div class="content">That is so true, especially with FV. Most AF variations had lots of benefits like this (SF was the one that did not, and really trimmed my lists down). I know important things in my life would have got done one way or the other (moving continents three times, etc), but not those guilty pleasures.<br><br>What do I have to show for it? My new handwriting! I took it up a couple of years ago using AF. With FV I am now revamping my personal and professional websites.</div>

<div class="content">@Cricket,<br><br>I totally agree.  My guilty pleasure has been reading - for pleasure.  Really, I almost forgot you can read a novel, just for the heck of it.  No report due on it or anything, just read it because you want to!  What a crazy concept!  <br><br>I had "Read Slant" (a SciFi novel by Greg Bear) on my FV list and it sunk to the bottom of my list (or the top - I guess it depends on your perspective) because I kept actioning tasks that I felt were more important/urgent, and therefore more psychologically ready.  When it reached the bottom of my list, I forced myself to take 10 min to read the first chapter.  Since then I've been preselcting it because I want to, and I've nearly finished it.<br><br>Just goes to show, that first dot on your preselct list isn't necessarily a task that you've been RESISTING.  It could be that you have just placed your focus on other things, and FV won't let you forget to take care of yourself as well.</div>

<div class="content">Greg Bear? I read Blood Music in Analog three decades ago, and it bothered me so much that I remembered his name. But, yeah, reading is one of those things I either do to much of at once, or put off. Little and often FTW!</div>

<div class="content">Hah!  What can I say, I'm into bothersome SciFi!  Yeah, Slant is the first I've read of his books, and so far I find it unsettling in a facinating kind of way.  ("It's so weird, but I can't *not* look.")<br><br>Blood Music is going on my "to read" list.  ;-)</div>

<div class="content">I've sometimes tried trimming my list down to what was only strictly necessary only to find that I built up so much resistance to doing it that nothing got done at all. <br><br>We do actually need those guilty pleasures because they are the rewards along the way for the hard work we are doing.</div>
