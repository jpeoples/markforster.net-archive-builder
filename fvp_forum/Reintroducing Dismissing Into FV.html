<div class="content">After I've come to terms with FV and started to like it, the one thing I still missed from AF was the dismissal of pages. In original FV, you always start from task 1 and there is no other choice than doing something about it or delete it.<br><br>But I've found it's easy to incorporate an AF-like dismissal process into FV, in an organic way:<br><br>1. I DON'T start with task 1. I start on PAGE 1, I scan the tasks until I come across one that "stands out". From there on, I build up my FV-chain. <br><br>If no task stands out, I dismiss the page. <br><br>Sounds familiar, hmm? And it feels absolutely natural.<br><br>2. FV-lists tend to grow longer. Whenever I have the feeling that it has become unmanageable, I dismiss all pages but the last three or so, go through the newly dismissed pages immediately and rewrite all tasks that I consider worthy of doing so at the end of the list. All others get highlighted for later reviews.<br><br>Sounds familiar, too, hmm? Works like a charm.<br><br>All other rules from AF apply as usual: Highlighting dismissed tasks, regular reviews, marking pages as dismissed etc.<br><br>I consider the dismissal process as a big help to avoid doing unnecessary tasks, and incorporating it into FV (which is as a process more powerful than all versions of AF) makes FV even more perfect ;-)</div>

<div class="content">I like it!    If I weren't already doing my own DIT+FV routine, I might try it!   :-)</div>

<div class="content">I had already started highlighting tasks that were older than 2 months, but I will try this.</div>

<div class="content">+JMJ+<br><br>You always make the most interesting systems, AndreasE.  If I weren't in AF2ND right now I'd try this.  Your Ping-PongAF is still my fave, though :D</div>

<div class="content">Interesting tweak AndreasE, I too missed the dismissal. As I mentioned elsewhere here, I based my dismissal / backlogging on DWM's. Ideally, no tasks remain untouched without dismissal more than 30days. Though, at the moment I dismiss tasks older than 60days, when I feel my FV list is getting too long.</div>

<div class="content">Interesting idea.  Probably a winner for those who love AF1's dismissal mechanism, and there seem to be many fans of dismissal here.  Personally, I prefer NOT to have a dismissal process, so AF2ND is more my style.<br><br>What is Ping-PongAF?</div>

<div class="content">For those that want to try time-based FV dismissal instead of page-based, giving you a full day to work on your soon to be dismissed items, the following is an earlier reply I made in another thread:<br><br>1. At the start of the day draw a line underneath the oldest block of un-actioned tasks ala Mark's instructions for Autofocus 2:<br><br>"At the beginning of each day...draw a line after the first block of unactioned tasks (i.e. the oldest tasks that are still awaiting action). These tasks are now “on notice” for dismissal. The block may include any number of tasks, from one upwards."<br><br>2. Dot your first task by scanning down from the oldest un-actioned, non-dismissed task, and dotting the first task that you want to do. Continue preselecting more tasks using the standard FV question and then work on your preselected list.<br><br>3. Again from Mark regarding Autofocus 2: <br><br>"At the beginning of the following day, all items before the line which have not been actioned are dismissed. The preferred way to dismiss items is to highlight them as this makes it easy to review them.<br><br>Then re-draw the line as before."<br><br>4. Add a task to your list to review your dismissed tasks, or, before doing your next preselecting, do as in Mark's instructions for Autofocus 4:<br><br>"The next time you come to the beginning of the list, you should finally cross off the highlighted tasks by deciding what to do with each one in turn. You may elect to abandon it, re-enter it on the Active List (with or without re-phrasing), or put it into a reminder system for review at a later date. In making the decision what to do with each task, you should look at the reasons why you haven’t done it yet."</div>

<div class="content">@nuntym<br>I used PingPong-AF for more than a year and it worked quite well – but I found that FV deals better with the "middle regions" of the AF list. On the other hand, the dismissal process is (once one gets used to the idea) very valuable. When I look at the dismissed tasks on my VERY old AF lists, I am usually glad I didn't waste effort and time on them. Hence my tweaking in order to get this feature back! ;-)</div>

<div class="content">+JMJ+<br><br>Is anyone else using this system? I just tried this FV tweak starting a week ago, just to see how it feels.  <br><br>Oh my goodness, this is probably the BEST task management system I have ever tried, bar-none.  I am NOT going back to AF2ND, I concede that the system I thought of is inferior to this one.<br><br>Congrats AndreasE! And to the others, consider that this glowing praise comes from someone who has not been able to use FV satisfactorily since its inception.  <br><br>Try it!</div>

<div class="content">@nuntym, thanks for giving this thread a bump - I missed it first time around.<br><br>Like AndreasE, I also don't start with Task 1. I choose the first task that "stands out" and if I don't get a "DO IT NOW!" feeling along with it, I then also choose the next task that stands out *more*.<br><br>By Colley's Rule, with just two "stand out" tasks I now have a high probability of having chosen the best task to do in that moment from the entire list.<br><br>So I keep my FV chains to just two items max. That way I am choosing freshly in conjunction with my subconscious inclinations. I feel that long FV chains were only valid at the time of selection and become stale very quickly as circumstances change.<br><br>When I have done the second item (if there was one), it is then *optional* whether I do the first item. I only do it if it still stands out at the moment I have to do it otherwise I just reselect 1 or 2 new tasks (as per the process above).<br><br>I have been using this idea in conjunction with AF2ND for rotating old tasks into view.<br><br>I've been using this 1-2 task selection approach for about a week and it has proved tremendous so far. I get a real feeling of being "in the zone" because I'm always dealing with the freshest "stand out" tasks from the list<br><br>"Standing out" to me is the in-the-moment signal we use to pass information from subconscious to conscious and therefore needs to be as up-to-date as possible.<br><br>The only thing that doesn't feel right is that the task list keeps growing too quickly but I think AndreasE may have hit upon a great solution with the page-based dismissal idea. I am going to give it a try in conjunction with my approach.</div>

<div class="content">This seems good for those of us with combined work/home lists, too. I've had a home item hanging out at the root of my chain for a couple of days and I always get back to that point while I'm at work (or at 11 at night when I'm not about to get out the mop & bucket). Choosing from the first PAGE could mitigate that somewhat...</div>
