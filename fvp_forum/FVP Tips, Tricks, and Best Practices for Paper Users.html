<div class="content">When using FVP, I use a:<br><br>• Lined Moleskine pocket softcover notebook<br>• Stainless steel Parker Jotter from France with .7 Parker black gel refills<br>• 3x5 cards in the notebook envelope with my morning, noon, and evening rituals, morning and evening questions, and a variety of recurring checklists and reference cards.</div>

<div class="content">Nice thread Michael B :)<br><br>• 8"x11" cheap ($0.50) notebook with 35 lines per page.<br>• Two cheap ballpoint pens, black and blue, which I interchange weekly per the hack/tip somewhere in these forums.<br>• I use the "no question sort" algorithm. Awesome hack, Mark<br>• All tasks, projects and info in the FVP.<br>    - Project tasks or info have format: /Project name/: task or info<br>    - Context tasks or info have format: Context: task or info<br>• I need my notebook to be messy, no preformed checklists nor rituals<br>• If some organization is needed, I do it on the fly using this: <a href="../fvp_forum/FVP with planning of contexts and projects.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/fv-forum/post/2507491</a></div>

<div class="content">- No question method<br>- Bic Cristal ball pen in Black, Blue, Red and Green changed daily (more colours currently on order).<br>- Standard size Moleskine lined notebook with green cover. (I use Moleskines for all sorts of things so I colour-code them).<br>- Everything goes on the list.<br>- I keep separate records of my progress in a large soft-cover Moleskine notebook (Black cover). This is for things like no. of press ups, distance walked, weight, etc.<br>- I use the list during all my waking hours</div>

<div class="content">My main reason for not working on paper is that I haven't figured out a good way to handle items that I only want to see in a few days or weeks time, without lots of rewriting. I don't like to have my list cluttered up with stuff that I can only work on later, because I'll tend to skip over them once I *can* work on them. Any suggestions how to handle this?</div>

<div class="content">Nicole:<br><br>Adding a Tickler to Your List<br><br>This is a light, flexible way to write future day-specific items straight into your list in a way that allows you to visually skip over them, not dot them, and scan (and potentially process) them only once a day. <br><br>Assuming you leave a little-finger-sized space between the left margin of your notebook and your tasks—so as to easily add and see your dots—simply write the date for that future task in that space, followed by the task, and then visually skip all such items during your normal scans.<br><br>For dates, I use the format: <br><br>5/30<br><br>For weekly recurring items, I use: <br><br>Fri <br><br>At the close of each day, scan down your list looking only at the dated items until you come to an item with tomorrow's date. When you come across such an item, cross it off and rewrite it at the end of your list with the word "Due:" in front of it and the date at the end. I currently use "Due:" as it stands out during scans with a bit more urgency behind it than the word "Today:"—my initial choice of word—which I found needed underlining to feel urgent. Re-adding the date at the end of the task is useful when you go to rewrite your recurring item and want to know the next date to add.<br><br><br>Example (assuming 5/30 is a Friday):<br><br>⁣⁣ ⁣•⁣ ⁣⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ Feed neighborhood rabid dog<br>5/30⁣⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣Pay electric bill<br>⁣⁣ ⁣•⁣ ⁣⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ Return red stapler<br>⁣⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣⁣ ⁣ ⁣⁣ ⁣Invent jump to conclusions game<br>Fri⁣ ⁣⁣⁣ ⁣ ⁣⁣   ⁣⁣ ⁣ ⁣  ⁣ ⁣  ⁣⁣⁣⁣  ⁣⁣⁣Weekly review<br>⁣⁣ ⁣• ⁣⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ Eat pie<br><br><br>The evening of Thursday 5/29 this becomes:<br><br>⁣⁣ ⁣•⁣ ⁣⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣Feed neighborhood rabid dog<br>⁣⁣ ⁣•⁣ ⁣⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣Return red stapler<br>⁣⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣⁣ ⁣ ⁣Invent jump to conclusions game<br>⁣⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣⁣ ⁣ Due: Pay electric bill 5/30<br>⁣⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ ⁣⁣ ⁣ Due: Weekly review Fri</div>

<div class="content">I still love paper and use as I said a moleskin on the right page for my FVP list. Left page is for notes and the end of it is for projects and permanent notes ie list of my buildings or clients. <br><br>But recently I am giving a try of FVP with Omnifocus I own on all my devices :  <a href="../fvp_forum/FVP in OmniFocus.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/fv-forum/post/2507206</a><br><br>The solution all paper is complicated and messy. The solution all computer is also complicated and I loose the feeling of doing things. But OF have some advantages :<br>1. Projects listing - collecting- planning and thinking<br>2. Context can be use like this<br><br>These are mine : <br>- Liste Prochaines actions (ie Next actions)<br>- Liste des actions déléguées (ie Waiting for others)<br>- SMB (- ie someday may be list including backlog)<br>- REF (Références) - For some check list like studying a building or my weekly review<br><br>This is where I am for the time beeing. But I am not sure to keep it like this. I may use in the future OF for non actionable task or future tasks and projects as I explained, keeping my paper list for what I really intend doing even If I have to write work on project X which will be on OF.<br><br>I like the feeling of paper. I like reformulating my tasks, I like to take some altitude with my computer. I dont want to depend on a machine to do things. I like freedom and intuition.</div>

<div class="content">Nicole:<br><br>I put meetings, travel and times I want to block off for uninerrupted work in my Outlook Calendar.<br><br>You could use the free version of Todoist to keep track of future tasks as well as routine tasks. TD will show those on the actual day, or Next 7 days if you wish.<br><br>It is also useful for keeping projects tasks and next step tasks,<br><br>Then when the tasks appear on TD, you can write them into a notebook, or, maintain a FVP list in TD.</div>

<div class="content">- Pukka Pad recycled A5, 110-page, 22 lines per page, ring-bound.<br><br>- Parker Jotter stainless steel mechanical pencil, with 0.5mm replacement leads and rubber heads.<br><br>- I use a little Post-It-sized square of white paper each day currently (while testing the system) to record what I've done in the order it was done, and sometimes some detail about the task.<br><br>- Currently Mark's original question - "What do I want to do more than x?" - is working best for me with the algorithm. It seems to keep me focused towards what I need done, and also offers a good work/leisure balance. I Haven't had the chance to test the No Question method seriously, though.<br><br>- I tend to put everything on my list.</div>

<div class="content">I love these sort of threads!<br><br>Currently using:<br><br>-- A4 / Letter sized cheapo notebook.<br>-- Any pen that I can lay my hands on (not easy in my house)<br>-- (Obviously) a scheduler for appointments and tickler items. <br>-- I prefer the no question algorithm, works great. <br><br>Working on few tweaks to suit my own needs including 'tabbing out' the top corner of a page when both sides of the page have only non actionable things left. <br><br>Trying out idea of dot with a vertical line for note / info items only that have been addressed and dot with horizontal line for auctioned individual tasks. <br>Trying out writing endeavours / projects that I want to complete at back of notebook and using the same dots lines and tab outs there too.</div>

<div class="content">Adding an AF4R Recurring Task "Page" to Your List<br><br><br>This is a a tip that will allow you to:<br><br>• See with a quick scan how many recurring tasks you have<br><br>• Remind yourself to rewrite recurring tasks at the end of the list when crossed out—useful for recurring tasks you are not yet in the habit of rewriting automatically<br><br>• Limit your focus to just recurring tasks during a scan for whatever reason—perhaps to handle a batch of recurring tasks first thing in the morning and then be free to visually skip all of the recurring tasks for a while during subsequent scans<br><br>• Limit your focus to just old, new, and unfinished tasks during a scan for whatever reason<br><br>• Use the tickler tip above for day and date-specific tasks and this tip for your daily and randomly recurring ones<br><br><br>To do this, simply add a light dot after your recurring tasks. Just before the edge of the page, so the dots line up. When you cross out the recurring task, you'll come to the dot, strike it through with your line, and be reminded to rewrite the task at the end of the list with a dot.<br> <br>The smaller the page the better this works visually. If using larger paper just bring the dots in a little from the edge of the page and do your best to keep them lined up.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for all the tickler-method tips. Michael B, I especially like your suggestion to have the marks for recurring items line up so I can focus on them or ignore them, depending on time of day. I had already figured out I need a way to mark recurring items, or I'll forget re-entering them, but this tip makes it easier to make a preselection based on routines first thing in the morning.</div>

Every bit of additional organization you add to the list increases the effort required to maintain it. Personally I don't enter anything except the task itself. All I do is change the colour of my pen each day - which of course doesn't add to the effort. <br><br>Except when you forget to change pens, which I've just done! Grrr!</div>

<div class="content">A lot of good stuff in this topic/thread.  I appreciate Mark's interventions as well.<br><br>Dated tasks: this is where my electronic Todoist is useful.  On each of my Work and Personal lists have the task, with emboldened text:<br><br>"Tasks below NOT FOR TODAY, but COULD be done if desired and possible"<br><br>Anything already dated for tomorrow onwards is dragged below that 'task'.<br><br>Any new task added is automatically added to the bottom of the list by the app, but I drag it up the pace just before the emboldened task.<br><br>That way my focus on is on everything from the top first task down to the emboldened "task".<br><br>As one can deduce, IF I feel like doing like a 'below-the-line' task, I might do so, and drag it up.<br><br>On showers: here in Africa where I'm living and working, few places have baths, just showers.  But I do miss the experience of luxuriating in a hot/warm bath and pondering things.<br><br>Like others, I often have a thought which I want to/should write down, but circumstances do not permit.  Lately I've been dictating thoughts relevant to the task list on my smartphone eg when trapped in traffic.  This does necessitate a task, "Check smartphone for task messages" which goes on my list.</div>

<div class="content">Jupiter – <br><br>I’d suggest you make a list on paper of the numbers 1-20 in random order and follow the rules asking the question “is there a smaller number than X?” Here’s what you’ll end up doing…<br><br>1)	Dot the first number.<br><br>2)	Compare the numbers below to that dotted number. Dot a number if it’s smaller.<br><br>3)	Compare the numbers below to this newly dotted number, dot a number if it’s smaller. Continue dotting smaller numbers until you reach the bottom of the list.<br><br>4)	The last dotted number at this point will be 1.

I will test the system tomorow and give you my return about it. It seems to be like a kind of ping pong reading. What is sure is that the last tasks automaticaly sorts because you read the all list. I like the stand out system. For what I understand my intuitive brain naturaly fetch what is worth to me (I don't know yet if it is important nor urgent !...)

<div class="content">Here are the two best tips for me to share with using the paper list:<br><br>1. Having to rewrite a task that you can't complete; due to context, energy, or whatever, is actually a good thing! First it really makes you evaluate whether this task is actually worth finishing, making you you commit to rewriting it. After working with my list for a while, I know that items at the end of the list have more power than those at the beginning due to the algortithm. I have to ask myself when rewriting a task, do I really want to assign this much "power" or priority to this task? I can simply choose to not rewrite it and let it fade. I can always write it again at the end of the list if it keeps bumping into my mind. But for now I can focus on the next task. <br><br>Secondly, when rewriting something I can refine the wording of the task, making it more or less specific according to real world variables. Having better wording on a task really helps knock down the resistance I have to getting off my ass and doing it. It can be more defined parameters which helps me know that there is an end or a context to the task, or it can be reasoning as to WHY I'd be doing it. "go through email" is more daunting than "go through email for 10 minutes" or "go through email because I want peace of mind". Also, if your task is "plan business seminar", and you've pretty much done everything for the event except for the pamplets, You don't need to rewrite the whole project. All you have to rewrite is anything left over, like "make sure pamphlets are on all the tables". That's your new, smaller project.<br><br>2. Forgetting! I get interrupted all the time at home and at work. Sometimes it's in the middle of me scanning the list and dotting items. I've got to do urgent things, I'm just plain tired and I want to goof off a bit, or I have a new thought that I've just got to write down on the end of my list. Now, when everything has calmed down, I forgot where I was, what I was doing, or even what's important. I've discovered that this is OK. As far as what's important, I trust the algorithm to sort it out (if not, don't use FVP, what's the point if you don't trust it, right?). As far as WHAT I should be working on, I simply go to the most recent "dotted" item and work on it as long as I can until I can't and need to rewrite, or have finished it. This is pretty much vanilla FVP, I believe, but I also don't worry about being interrupted in the middle of a scan. I'll get back to a scan eventually after finishing a "dotted" item. <br><br>(I've learned that Mark's totally correct, that "dotting" too many items is not good, my little 50-page pocket notebook is almost full on one side! It's a good visual reminder to not "dot" too many things. I'm eager for the algorithm to give me access to the items early in the list on the first couple of pages, so I'm "dotting" with that in mind.)</div>

I don't like having to turn three dead (filled with crossed-out tasks) pages in the middle of my active list when preselecting.  With the Arc notebook I can just pull such dead pages out from the middle of my list.  The pages are simply printer pages so they are abundant and cheap.<br><br>I have hacked my systems to the nth degree several times in the past and I always (ALWAYS) came to the same conclusion:  It's always better to just get on with it and do the tasks, and hacks just hamstring the "getting on with it" rule.  "Hacks" involve researching / inventing them, integrating them with other implemented hacks, testing them for a period of time, and ultimately even just using them.  Basically "Hack my system" always became a too-frequently-recurring task on my list.  A few days ago, I promised myself to follow two principles no matter what system I use: "Less is More" and "Just Do It."  <br><br>So I use FVP, with no question.  That's it.  No additional hack on top of it.  So far, I find that no other system I've tried works as well as this.  I capture everything, forget nothing, "little and often" away my resistance without trying, build up productive momentum as fast as SMEMA, but sustain it as long as I like, and easily return to where I left off if I get thrown off track.  What more can I ask of a Time Management System?<br><br>I'm considering my commitment to use those two principles to be like the sobriety of a recovering alcoholic.  I may watch others greatly enjoying their hacks (like a recovering alcoholic watching others enjoy their drinks at a party), but I'll indulge in none of them.  Heck, I may even look into having a "Hackless since 6/16/2015" sobriety coin made to carry around in my pocket.</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br>I think the elastic band stays relatively solid on the Moleskines, not losing much elasticity. In my case, the envelope in back came undone and had to be removed. There is a benefit and a drawback to this. On the one hand, the notebook is far more flexible and lightweight. I barely notice it in my pocket now as it flexes easily with my movement. On the other hand, the elastic band is designed to grip with the envelope present, and when you reach the last ¼ of the pages, it's expecting to grip those pages along with the envelope.</div>

<div class="content">I found for myself that one factor for using FVP more effectively is finding the right balance between portability and functionality with the tools you have.<br><br>A few months ago, I was using a 3"x5" 'tickler' notebook, thinking that the portability will mean that I will use it more often.  However, I quickly found that it was hard for me to use.  Not only was there barely enough space to write down tasks, the spring binding was interfering with my hand movements while writing.  I quickly ditched it.<br><br>I then used a huge 8.5"x11" notebook.  I loved writing in it but the sheer size of it made it awkward bringing it with me all the time.  Another unexpected side effect of the size was that rapidly flipping pages around as I am wont to do damages the pages; not only that but since there are a lot more tasks per page I was flipping around those pages longer.  Soon the written pages were looking grimy and wrinkled.  All of these meant that I was starting to not like using the notebook, from which I started using my smartphone.<br><br>The most portable for me is just using my smartphone.  It has my calendar and alarms so it is a complete time management system already.  The problem, as Mark Forster has already said time and again, is that it is slower to use than paper and pencil.  That slowness means that my FVP list in electronic format rarely, if ever, goes over 40 items, and there are many times that I skip consulting my FVP list before doing tasks.<br><br>I decided to go back to using pen and paper yesterday, and thinking of my past experiences I bought a 4"x6" spring-bound notebook.  While browsing around in the stationery shop I also found a thin, elegant pen that can easily fit inside the spring binding for storage.<br><br>Just a small increase in the size of the notebook from my previous 'tickler' was a big improvement for me.  I found it very comfortable to write in it.   Flipping around the pages also was a breeze.  And yet, the portability of the notebook was not compromised.  In fact, It seems to fit in my pocket better than the smaller notebook!<br><br>In my second day of using of the notebook I have been very impressed with it.  I find that I have been using it more often, bringing it with me and more importantly writing and marking it often.  And I know I am trusting it more as there are more 40 active items in it now.</div>

I used one for years, but I don't even know if you can still get them.<br><br>[Afternote: Yes, you can. <a href="http://www.filofax.co.uk/saffiano-organiser-1.html#year=2015&color=Raspberry&size=5980" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.filofax.co.uk/saffiano-organiser-1.html#year=2015&color=Raspberry&size=5980</a> and it does look as pretty as a Moleskine!]<br><br>My A4 binder is quite large (A4-sized in fact), but it's light and will fit in a briefcase or small backpack, and you can carry a lot of papers in it as well as your task list.</div>

<div class="content">@will << a sheet of blank A4 folded down to A7 (16 pages)......I appreciate that this doesn't help our valued colonial colleagues so much >> <br><br>Does it end up something like this - <a href="http://experimentwithnature.com/03-found/experiment-with-paper-how-to-make-a-one-page-zine/#.VcCwj_lViko" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://experimentwithnature.com/03-found/experiment-with-paper-how-to-make-a-one-page-zine/#.VcCwj_lViko</a> ? It starts with letter size (slightly shorter than A4) and ends as a small 8-page book which can be turned inside-out for another 8 pages.  <br><br>There was (still is?) a site(s) that let you print checklists, lines, grids, etc on letter size paper that when folded, each of the 8 pages had its own format.</div>

<div class="content">Lillian:<br><br><< OTOH, it does make it easy to take a list of errands, to-do's, etc for a day or 2 without bringing the entire notebook >><br><br>Usually when one's travelling most of the other pieces of paper you take with you will be A4 - from the print-out plane/rail ticket to the conference programme - so why not just take a sheet from your A4 refill pad and use that? With 46 lines to the page, using two columns and both sides of the sheet, you would have room for 184 tasks. No need for any fancy foldings.</div>

<div class="content">I use an 8" x 8" (21cm x 21cm) Rhodia reverse book, 160 pages (80 sheets), heavy grid-lined paper, durable plastic covers. It can be used with the binding on the side or the top. I generally have my todo list on the left third of the page and make notes on the right two thirds.</div>

<div class="content">Mark - that's true, but the folded list fits in the extra credit card slots in my travel bag which makes it quicker to find than in a folder or binder of other papers. It's not something I do on a day-to-day basis, I do find it handy as an occasional "keep track of while I'm out" list keeper. <br><br>(and not sure if something changed on the site or my browser, but I can *finally* use the capcha again to post! If it's the site that was changed, thank you!)</div>

<div class="content">Will said:<br><< If you want REALLY portable, a sheet of blank A4 folded down to A7 (16 pages) is hard to beat. >><br><br>Ah yes, that's what I use when I did AF/FV on my smartphone. I always have an A4 sheet folded to A7 in shirt pocket. I can use it to make notes in a jiffy, especially when I am already using my smartphone for something else, like a phone call say. I tend to reuse discarded one sided printed papers, because by the time I finish one side, the folded paper is well worn ready to be thrown away anyway.<br><br>Now that I am using an A7 small paper notebook for FVP, I don't really need that A4/A7 paper. :-)</div>

<div class="content">I use paperclips - one on the top of the last page (where I'm entering new tasks) and one on the side pointing the currently active task... when I pick a "partial" chain, I just leave the pointer clip on the last task I worked on for the visual reminder of where scanning from.</div>

<div class="content">I used to use those little square mini postits for the book I used in work. I had one for the page with monthly goals, another for any daily goals, another to mark my Waiting For pages, another for any topic specific notes and then loads for project-specific pages. In the end the book looked like it was growing a paper beard!  I had let it creep and become too convoluted.  Those little postits are still handy though.</div>

<div class="content">My notebook filled up, and I've decided to keep using it.  So I've attached a second notebook with a rubber band, like a cheap Midori Travelers Notebook.   It works surprisingly well so far - holds much better than I would have expected and doesn't cause the pages to bulge.</div>

<div class="content">I'm thinking about investing in Moleskine Cahiers when my current Moleskine fills up. Individually thin and flexible so they don't make quite such a dent in the suit. and when you fill one, you could attach another until the first is cleared.</div>

<div class="content">@Laby<br><br>Sorry for the late reply, I'm currently out of town which makes it harder to reply, although I have no problems reading posts.<br><br>A project notebook is where you collate anything and everything about a project, as the link I provided above states. Since "The main purpose of a project notebook is to record your work as it progresses," all entries are dated.  The entries done are very informal and regularly includes my feelings about a project, but that same informality ensures that the information recorded can be surprisingly complete as well as promote creativity.  This is aided by the fact that I used unlined paper, which seems to help my creativity even further, and a binder, which makes it trivial to add such things as receipts, calling cards, etc.  <br><br>Now for my own use, I consider a project as anything that is (1) composed of multiple tasks, and/or (2) important enough to warrant monitoring.  I currently have five projects but I have a feeling that could have been a lot more if I was back home.  <br><br>I cross reference my projects to my calendar and FVP by using a shortcut of the project name enclosed in slashes.   For example, let us use my project "Car Management and Repair".  If I want to remind myself that I want to check and update that project I add this to my FVP:<br><br>/Car/<br><br>If I want to add something to the project notebook, I use an arrow; therefore I write to my FVP<br><br>/Car/ --> Bobot Tel# xxx-xxxx-xxx<br><br>If I want to add a task from a project note to my FVP, I write<br><br>/Car/: call Bobot re. car maint sched<br><br>while I enclose written task in my project notebook in slashes.  Therefore the task above reads in my project notebook as<br><br>/Call Bobot re. car maint sched/<br><br>If the task was done, I delete the task in FVP per the rules, and I usually add a reminder to update the project notebook. On the other hand, in project notebook I add a check to the task:<br><br>✓ /call Bobot re. car maint sched/</div>

<div class="content">I began a project notebook a few monthes ago with evernote. The basic idea was to collect in one place all my relevant projects based on a GTD approach. Paper was complicated (even if I have hesitated a lot !) I had so many projects that it was difficult to follow. Anyway. It has a great effect on my activities. I dont know if i do it righly but I collect everything. Notes, numbers, historical stuff, inspiration all about one project even phone numbers. <br><br>I feel more focus on what I do. My mind feel quitest. For the tasks I report them on my list. I wont call it a FV list it is more a global list were I extract the tasks I really want to do today. I do them one by one. This list is on paper on a paper notebook. I also plan my projects for each day I do it the night before.</div>

<div class="content">@jupiter<br><br><<- Is there then 2 lists one is the project list and the other is you FV list ?>><br>My project notebook cannot be exactly called a list, but more of a diary or journal.   The notebook is divided into sections, one section per project.<br><br><<- Do you think I am right in the way to do it ?>><br>A project notebook can be of any format as you want it, as long as it helps!
