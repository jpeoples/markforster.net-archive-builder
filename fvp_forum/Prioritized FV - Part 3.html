I've never disputed that.  It's a VERY simple change to the mechanics of the system, but a substantial change to the dynamics of the system.  Small changes can have a large effect.<br><br><< If you like the new dynamics, great, go for it! >><br><br>Yes, I do like the new dynamics.  I find them to be a significant improvement over standard FV for me.  You might not like them, but it's hard to really know if you haven't actually tried it.<br><br><< But it is not accurate to state, as you often have, that this is only a very minor change to the rules that puts more emphasis on what's important. >><br><br>Yes, it IS a minor change to the rules (the mechanics) -- but the effect IS large (the dynamics).  If the effect of the change were as minor as the mechanics of it, it wouldn't be worth bothering.<br><br>The design of the change was intended to place more emphasis on high-priority tasks, and my experience using it has shown that's exactly what it does, at least for me.  YMMV.<br><br>Question: Has anyone given Prioritized FV a fair shot (using it for at least 5-10 chains over a week or more) and concluded that it made the system WORSE than standard FV?  It's not clear to me that it will help everyone, but who has found the change to be detrimental in actual practice, not just in theory?<br><br><< With a single star, your attention is drawn to the root item, the one with the star. >><br><br>Yes, and that's the goal.  If you have one task that is a priority over everything else, then drawing your attention to that item is a good thing.<br><br>In fact, if you use Prioritized FV and only star exactly ONE task, you get the variation that Elynn invented (<a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/fv-forum/post/1829960#post1829960):" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/fv-forum/post/1829960#post1829960):</a> "Another variation I've been using - for those real bug-a-bear items that actually make it to the top of the list spot, I leave them at the top of the list til they are well and truly DONE. I only have to take some small action to end the chain, but then the same general project stays at the top of the list. That way I keep chipping away at it on every chain. Everything else I work on gets bumped to the bottom of the list after I take some action on it."<br><br><< Your attention is thus drawn to the beginning of the list, where the most stale items tend to sit, rather than the end of the list, which is where the freshest and newest and highest urgency and high priority items would naturally flow. >><br><br>Your attention isn't supposed to be on part of the list -- the preselection process is supposed to involve scanning the ENTIRE list every time.  Therefore, this shouldn't matter -- when you're in the "neighborhood" of stale items, you can scan quickly through it until you get to the more interesting ones.  With Prioritized FV, you learn quickly that the most interesting tasks are at the top of the list as well as at the end of the list, and you skim across the middle.</div>

<div class="content">[I have a number of posts to respond to; I'm not following any particular order at the moment.]<br><br>Re: <a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/fv-forum/post/1827694?currentPage=2#post1831419" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/fv-forum/post/1827694?currentPage=2#post1831419</a><br><br>Seraphim:<br><br><< Personally I don't see it as a problem if it takes a long time to get through chains, as long as my work is getting done. Sometimes that's just the way it goes. >><br><br>To a certain degree, I am in agreement with you on this.  However, I've also found that tasks can stall if I allow a chain to span several days, causing "faux urgency" if you will.  That seems less likely to occur if I can complete several chains per day.<br><br><< If you find that it helps you, great! >><br><br>I haven't achieved that goal yet, so it's hard to compare.  But I'm mindful of Mark's recommendation to try to complete at least 3 chains/day, and I'm sure this recommendation has a good basis.<br><br><< OK, great! If it works for you, I am not opposing that. I am opposing what I see as misunderstandings of the dynamics of FV. :-) >><br><br>I don't believe I'm misunderstaning the dynamics of FV; I'm trying to change them, as you rightly point out.  The dynamics of Prioritized FV are substantially different than standard FV, but I believe they are better balanced.  Obviously, not everyone agrees, but I've yet to see anyone who has actually TRIED it and hated it.</div>

Prioritized FV never draws your attention away from high-priority tasks to work on a low-priority root task.  Obviously, if you minimize the amount of work you do on that low-priority task, the impact is mitigated, but it's still a distraction.</div>

<div class="content">Deven >>that root task is still getting SOME attention that could have gone elsewhere.<<<br><br>If I'm understanding the post correctly, the root task you're talking about is a low(-er) priority item. And if it's the next item to be worked on, then by defintion, when using FV rules, the high(-er) priority items have already been worked on during the chain that's almost done (I say almost done because you're about to work on the root task). <br><br>If the root task is such a low priority that 'getting SOME attention' is a distraction to the rest of the priority items, why is that item even on the list? Move it to a tickler for next week (or never) or delete it. <br><br>Maybe when using Priority-FV, that task never gets dotted because it's a low priority, but isn't it still a distraction just to keep finding it during the selection process and have to consider (even for a couple of seconds) the relative priority and if it should be dotted or not?</div>

Prioritized FV is intended to focus more on high-priority tasks WITHOUT eliminating the possibility of working on low-priority tasks.  There's nothing to stop you from selecting low-priority tasks for your chains -- Prioritized FV only guarantees that the root task in the chain will be high-priority if anything is prioritized.<br><br><< Maybe when using Priority-FV, that task never gets dotted because it's a low priority, but isn't it still a distraction just to keep finding it during the selection process and have to consider (even for a couple of seconds) the relative priority and if it should be dotted or not? >><br><br>Not really, because you're just scanning your list looking for the answer to The Question -- "What do I want to do before I do x?"  It's no more of a distraction than it already is during the preselection process in standard FV.<br><br>Having a low-priority task in the actual chain is more of a distraction because you're supposed to stop and actually focus on that task and at LEAST "get out the folder" if you can, or preferably do something more useful.  You're supposed to take action on the task, and if it's something you easily CAN take action on, you're more likely to do so.  You might even get wrapped up dealing with it because you're happy to be making some progress on an old task.  Nothing wrong with that, but it remains a distraction from the higher priorities.</div>

<div class="content">Deven:<br><br><br><br>Lillian to Deven: <br>"...if it's the next item to be worked on, then by defintion, when using FV rules, the high(-er) priority items have already been worked on during the chain that's almost done (I say almost done because you're about to work on the root task)."<br><br><br><br>Deven to Lillian: <br>"Yes, if you're about to work on the root task, it means you're almost finished with the chain. That doesn't tell you anything about how many of the tasks in the chain were high or low priority, of course..."<br><br><br><br>... Lillian is correct. The fact that you're almost finished with the chain and the root is yet to be actioned tells you that everything in the chain was high-priority/urgent when you built the chain. <br><br>As you're aware, when building a chain, with the exception of the root task, everything in the chain is prioritized by urgency and the urgency of the task is based on the importance of the task to you (how long you're willing to put up with it not being done or it has a deadline and must be started soon) translated into a time scale. To quote Mark, "Urgency is importance translated into a time scale that is appropriate for the task." And the urgency/high-priority level of a given task changes dynamically based on the time of day, preconditions being met, and the weather, among others.<br><br>The reason you do the root task "regardless of importance, urgency or any other factor" as Mark states, is because the system automatically puts tasks there that you may be resisting or putting off. The system is designed to get you to make a decision on that task after enough time passes and this is a balance in the system. <br><br>Your chain is always made of high-priority/urgent tasks. Your root task is a balance to that. <br><br>To quote Mark, "...the FV preselection process ensures that tasks towards the beginning of the list are given as much attention as tasks towards the end of the list." <br><br>When faced with a root task you deem to be low-priority you *need* to take action on it, as you say "at the expense of higher-priorities" to balance the system. Your chain is made of 100% highest-priority tasks when you build it. When Mark said, "No doubt saving the world is more important than eating breakfast, but it still makes sense to eat breakfast before we set out on our work for saving the world" he was saying that eating breakfast was the highest-priority task on the entire list when the chain was built.<br><br><br><br>Some quotes from Mark:<br>"...what "Prioritizing by Urgency” should mean is that we do things according to the degree of urgency they possess. The degree of urgency may fall anywhere between Must be Done This Second to Not at All Urgent. Where a task falls on this continuum is the deciding factor. This is a sensible method of prioritizing."<br><br>"It may seem odd to you that both the degree of importance and the degree of urgency should be expressed in terms of time for prioritizing purposes. But that is what prioritizing is all about: the order in which tasks are done."<br><br>"We can’t just say “Task X is more important than Task Y: therefore I’ll do Task X first”. That is where prioritizing by importance falls down. No doubt saving the world is more important than eating breakfast, but it still makes sense to eat breakfast before we set out on our work for saving the world."<br><br>"The root tasks have been done in strict list order, regardless of importance, urgency or any other factor. Some of them are relatively easy...and some are relatively difficult...or you are reluctant to do them....<br> <br>Each of the root tasks is preceded by a short ladder of tasks which are in the order in which you want to do them. The number and difficulty of the tasks in the ladder tend to reflect the difficulty of the root tasks.<br><br>...the FV preselection process ensures that tasks towards the beginning of the list are given as much attention as tasks towards the end of the list."<br><br><br><br><br>Deven said:<br>"Having a low-priority task in the actual chain is more of a distraction because you're supposed to stop and actually focus on that task... You're supposed to take action on the task, and if it's something you easily CAN take action on, you're more likely to do so. You might even get wrapped up dealing with it...happy to be making...progress on an old task. Nothing wrong with that, but it remains a distraction from the higher priorities."<br><br><br><br>... And your higher priorities can be immediately added to any chain, at any time, to do before the root, as they occur to you or by doing as Mike D. and having a look over your list to see if anything has become urgent. You can do all of this before working on this possibly low-priority root task but bear in mind the following:<br><br>Higher priorities = urgent tasks.<br><br>And those urgent tasks should be done in order of their urgency, as in "...before I do X?", and that urgency is determined by their importance to you as in "What do I want to do...". The portion of the FV question "What do I want to do..." gets you to determine the importance level a task holds for you and the "...before I do X" puts that task on a time scale. FV is designed to do a number of things, and one of them is to balance the need to focus on the higher priorities/urgent tasks with the need to handle important, but possibly low-urgency, resistant, procrastinated on, old, backlogged, distracting, or back-burner tasks.<br><br><br><br>Remember:<br><br>• If it's on your list, it's important.<br><br>• And if it's on your list you've committed to completing the task. <br><br>• And if you've committed to completing the task, it must be done. <br><br>• And if it must be done you must add it to a chain. <br><br>• And if you don't add it to a chain the system will find out, call you on it, and choose the task for you as the last task of your chain. Mark carefully thought out how this would work using structured procrastination.<br><br>• At this point you have a decision to make regarding your root task — consider whether it can be done now, do a little work on it, re-phrase it, move it off your list, or delete it.</div>

If you can throw anything you want on the end of the list at random as you think of it, why is it a problem to start with an existing list?

No doubt saving the world is more important than eating breakfast, but it still makes sense to eat breakfast before we set out on our work for saving the world." >><br><br>Prioritized FV doesn't attempt to do this.  It only ensures that the root task is a high-priority task, if there are any.  Your answers to The Question allow other things to be done first, such as eating breakfast.<br><br><< "The root tasks have been done in strict list order, regardless of importance, urgency or any other factor. Some of them are relatively easy...and some are relatively difficult...or you are reluctant to do them.... >><br><br>This is exactly what Prioritized FV is tuning -- the ordering of the root tasks.<br><br><< Each of the root tasks is preceded by a short ladder of tasks which are in the order in which you want to do them. The number and difficulty of the tasks in the ladder tend to reflect the difficulty of the root tasks. >><br><br>Prioritized FV retains this feature.<br><br><< ...the FV preselection process ensures that tasks towards the beginning of the list are given as much attention as tasks towards the end of the list." >><br><br>I responded to this above, but isn't it interesting how many people seem to focus all their attention on the END of the list and treat the start of the list as unimportant?<br><br><< ... And your higher priorities can be immediately added to any chain, at any time, to do before the root, as they occur to you or by doing as Mike D. and having a look over your list to see if anything has become urgent. >><br><br>You're allowed to add an urgent task to the chain, but you're not supposed to be routinely extending a chain as Mike D. is doing.<br><br><< You can do all of this before working on this possibly low-priority root task but bear in mind the following:<br><br>Higher priorities = urgent tasks. >><br><br>Not necessarily.  If you have a major project due in 6 months that will take 3 months of effort, then working on it today is NOT urgent, but it can still be a high priority.<br><br><< And those urgent tasks should be done in order of their urgency, as in "...before I do X?", and that urgency is determined by their importance to you as in "What do I want to do...". The portion of the FV question "What do I want to do..." gets you to determine the importance level a task holds for you and the "...before I do X" puts that task on a time scale. FV is designed to do a number of things, and one of them is to balance the need to focus on the higher priorities/urgent tasks with the need to handle important, but possibly low-urgency, resistant, procrastinated on, old, backlogged, distracting, or back-burner tasks. >><br><br>Prioritized FV is attempting to achieve a better balance, and particularly to drive high-resistance high-priority tasks to completion faster.  Standard FV makes it EASIER to procrastinate on high-resistance tasks by allowing you to ignore the task as long as possible, only dealing with it on the infrequent occasions it becomes the root task.  With Prioritized FV, procrastination on high-resistance high-priority tasks is reduced because they become the root task more frequently.<br><br><< Remember:<br><br>• If it's on your list, it's important.<br><br>• And if it's on your list you've committed to completing the task. <br><br>• And if you've committed to completing the task, it must be done. >><br><br>This is why I'm not inclined to follow Lillian's suggestions to get the low-priority tasks off my main list.<br><br><< • And if it must be done you must add it to a chain. >><br><br>Eventually.<br><br><< • And if you don't add it to a chain the system will find out, call you on it, and choose the task for you as the last task of your chain. Mark carefully thought out how this would work using structured procrastination. >><br><br>If you read the "structured procrastination" essay, it specifically talks about accomplishing things as a way of procrastinating on something MORE IMPORTANT.  Prioritized FV actually fits this model better than standard FV, since that root task is always one of the more important ones.<br><br><< • At this point you have a decision to make regarding your root task — consider whether it can be done now, do a little work on it, re-phrase it, move it off your list, or delete it. >><br><br>As I said, there is a legitimate concern about Prioritized FV's ability to prune the old tasks this way, because it ultimately depends on finishing (or de-prioritizing) all the high-priority tasks so low-priority tasks can cycle through the "magic slot" at the top of the list.  The jury's still out on this one.</div>

I tend to allow such interrupts without placing them on the list or putting them in a chain.  I basically go off-list temporarily to deal with the interrupts and then return to processing the list.

<div class="content">Working off-list isn't automatically bad (or is it?), but you do run the risk that you're missing something that the system might remind you of, or misdirecting your focus.  I go off-list for little things like new email.  I'm not sure if that's a problem or not.  (But ultimately, if you're getting done what you need to get done, when you need to get it done, that's the most important thing.)</div>

<div class="content">I stalled all morning, then made acceptable progress on the projects others depend on right now. Only those projects, nothing else, not even longer projects like continually setting a good example for the kids about unpacking after the holidays.<br><br>I updated the list as if I used it, so projects that got action today are in the newest page, and will try again Thursday.

So, if a chain stalled with just that task left, I scrapped the chain and started fresh. After a few rounds of that, I was happy to deal with the oldest line. FV normally whips through those old projects. This shifts the balance so the priority tasks get more attention, without totally neglecting the old ones.<br><br>Koske, I use "oldest line" for "first unactioned item". I prefer oldest line because often that project isn't unactioned -- it got action several weeks ago. "First line" is the first line when you're making a chain. Normally, they're the same, but with p-FV the high-priority projects are written above the low-priority projects, even if the low-p ones are older.<br><br>In my case, it didn't feel like I was resisting the high-priority tasks -- at least not too much -- but usually my chains were long and off-balance. I'd be in the mood to make great progress on stalled low-priority projects, and over-confident. My chains were off-balance, with too many low-priority tasks chosen on the early pages. It didn't help that when I imported a list, I kept the original date, so there were always pages of old, stalled, low-priority projects.<br><br>Once I set FV aside, I made good, fast progress on the priorities, with no resistance.<br><br>As an exercise, I might try changing The Question to "If I could only do one thing before X?" or "If I could only do one thing in addition to X before another chance to work on my priority projects?" In both cases, build a chain, just like the normal FV.<br><br>Deven, <br>Stars for resistance is redundant. The main list is already sorted that way! An awareness of resistance feeds into priority. If you have two otherwise-equal tasks, the one that is more likely to stall if you don't give it regular attention is higher priority.</div>

<div class="content">matthewS:<br><br>That was positively cathartic!  <br><br>I think one of reasons this thread seems to be going 'round and 'round is due to the various definitions we give to the following vague terms:<br><br>urgency<br>importance<br>resistance<br>priority<br><br>There even seems to be confusion around the word "want"!<br><br>If we don't agree on fairly precise definitions of these terms communication will go nowhere.  Mark has been very helpful in sorting some of this out.<br><br>The word "priority" is a special problem.  In some instances of use it seems to mean importance and in other uses it means precedence or sequence.<br><br>FV works very well for me.  I generally allow my unconscious to quickly answer the question what do I want to do before x?  For my purposes it doesn't really matter what urgency, importance or resistance means.  What matters is what I want to do BEFORE x for what ever reason (conscious or otherwise).  As Mark has pointed out just because I want to do something doesn't mean I have to like it.<br><br>Building a chain using the question sets up an ordered task list.  Each task is actioned PRIOR to the next.  Thus it is a list of ordered priorities but due to the problems with the word "priority" it may be better to say each task precedes the next.  I call it a list of precedence to avoid confusion.<br><br>I often complete each pre-selected chain in order of precedence without interruption.  When an urgent task comes to my attention that can't wait for me to complete a chain I deal with it as soon as I can stop what I'm doing.  There are times and situations where this can happen repeatedly.  The list gets extended with tasks that take precedence over all the existing selections.  The result is that I am always doing what I want to do before the next task in the list of precedence.  It is more important to me that I am doing that than it is to complete any given chain without interuption.  When things settle down I quickly complete the chain which has its own benefits.<br><br>Whether it is a tweak or not it seems simple and straight forward and works for me.</div>

<div class="content">Mike D and others:<br><br><< urgency<br>importance<br>resistance<br>priority >><br><br>Priority is simply the order in which you should do things. As Michael B. says it's whether you do one thing prior to another. A high priority task is one which, for whatever reason, should be done before lower priority tasks. You may choose to give something priority because a lot is hanging on it, or you may choose to give something else priority because you hate doing it and know the only way to get it done is to do it straight away. Or you might give something priority because if you don't do it today it will be too late to do it at all.<br><br>These three are examples of prioritizing by importance, by resistance and by urgency.<br><br>Prioritizing consistently by any one of these on its own presents a problem. If you prioritize by importance or resistance only, then urgent stuff is liable to get neglected. If you prioritize by urgency only then important but non-urgent stuff gets neglected (and usually acquires quite a degree of resistance too)<br><br>The ideal solution is one which takes all three of these into account, which is precisely what FV is designed to do.<br><br>Deven's states:<br><br>"... the FV algorithm draws attention to the first item, and standard FV indiscriminantly uses the oldest unactioned task, while Prioritized FV draws attention to the oldest unactioned task at the highest priority level."<br><br>This contradicts itself because if you are giving something a high priority then you want to do it before other lower priority tasks. This is the definition of "priority". Therefore the question "What to you want to do before x?" would already have resulted in the high priority task being selected. If it doesn't, it's because you are not actually giving the task priority.<br><br>Giving a task top priority is not a matter of putting stars in front of it and moving it around the list. It's a matter of doing it first.</div>

<div class="content">Thank you Mark for the clarity.  Tasks don't have importance, resistance, urgency, or priority intrinsically. We grant them all of those attributes at specific moments of time and only in relationship to the tasks we've committed to. I've not found any system that tries to encode and assign those attributes to a task to have any long term utility as the overhead of maintaining the "correct" coding for any length of time becomes unbearable.<br><br>FV works for me because of its simplicity. I don't need to think about all of the overhead and what priority a task should have, all I need to do is figure out what I want to do before X and then do it. <br><br>My experience is that it doesn't matter if it's the absolute best thing to do right now, it is always a good enough thing to do right now and I'll be doing something else good enough or a little better right after it. I get lots of good enough work done with FV and fret very little about not having done the best possible thing at any particular moment.<br><br>Do things get missed? Rarely, and its never as important as I thought it might have been.<br><br>Thanks again Mark!</div>

<div class="content">Lol @ matthewS and Stefano. <br><br>I feel as if I'm jumping on the bandwagon with this. But I'm glad to see this is finally clarifying. 4 threads with plus 50 comments each is hard to follow. Especially with long comments. I threw in the towel on this thread at least 4 times but I keep seeing it at the top that I can't help but read. <br><br>Not to add confusion but I always thought of priority to mean just that. Something done prior to the something else. It may have attributes of importance and urgency (like Eisenhowers matrix respective quadrants for priority 1,2,3 and 4) it may have attributes to criticality and emotion ( like  respective quadrants for priority 1,2,3,4) it could be based on impact and effort (like an action priority matrix) It could be some wild combination of many things. Regardless of ones choice for determining what is and what is not a priority, prioritization simply sorts things to do in a sequential order.  As in first, second, third ... <br><br>This is why prioritized FV in my opinion seems back to front. You have to do N (N being a number that could also be zero) number of other things before what you would consider a top priority. it's almost like always doing something in quadrant 2,3,or 4 before something in quadrant 1.  Quadrants being priorities or stars of how however one determined it. <br><br>From Crickets example of the list I asked for an example of, it seems as if quadrant 1 tasks are done in standard FV style, then quadrant 2 done in standard FV , then quadrant 3 done in standard FV , then quadrant 4 done in standard FV. As Cricket said,  the mid level priority tasks don't worry her.  Which makes sense. This seems logical to me as long as your priorities are in order all the time <br><br>To me, The only problem that I can see is that priorities change fast. So organizing the list by stars is a lot of work, whereas standard FV is much easier as I rely on my intuition whih depends only on what the moment says the priorities are. <br><br>As I understand it, prioritized FV ensures that a "priority" is placed in each chain.  But, from my experience with regular FV my priorities build the chain because I'm asking what do I want to do before x?</div>
