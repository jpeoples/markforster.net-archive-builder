<div class="content">The FV instructions say you can clear all your dots, or just scan from your last dot to the end of the list and make new dots, whenever you've been away from your list for a bit and your preselection feels "stale".<br><br>For me, this happens pretty frequently:<br>- I go to a meeting then come back to my desk<br>- I am interrupted by a telephone call<br>- I spend a long time working on one particular task, and meanwhile lots of new emails have come in<br>- I take a lunch break<br>- Etc.<br><br>I have found it's a natural thing for me to go through a "reset" procedure at these times.  I also follow the same procedure whenever I complete a chain and am ready to create a new one.<br><br>Here is my reset procedure:<br>1. Clear any Outlook reminders that have popped up, and add any relevant tasks to FV.<br>2. Empty my notebook of any new notes that I have collected while away at meetings -- transfer tasks to FV.<br>3. Clear my email.<br>4. Check my calendar, to see how much time I have till my next meeting, and to double check whether any of those meetings require preparation (if yes, add to FV)<br>5. Clear my voicemail.<br>6. Do a stretching exercise or two.<br>7. Rescan the FV list from the last dotted item, and make new dots if needed.<br><br>All this takes just a few minutes, usually.  I find it is more natural to do all these things all at once, before working through the chain again, rather than having each of these items as individual tasks on the FV list itself.<br><br>I didn't really do this consciously as a "tweak" -- it just sort of started happening this way.<br><br>Anybody else doing anything like this?</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br>Yes, I guess I'm doing much the same - though not with quite such a standard routine.<br><br>As long as I'm satisfied that I'm doing it in order to get work done and not to procrastinate, I'm happy about it. <br><br>But I need to qualify that last statement a bit. One of the purposes of the preselect ladder is to soften one's resistance up in order to get the early tasks on the list done. If I'm taken away from the list for a while, sometimes I find that the softening up has hardened again. So rather than force myself to get a difficult task done, I can just add a few new tasks to the list and soften the resistance up again.</div>
