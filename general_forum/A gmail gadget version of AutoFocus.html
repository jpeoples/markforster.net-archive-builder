<div class="content">I'm a big fan of gmail personally.<br><br>I'm wondering if there's some way of implementing AutoFocus as a gmail gadget.<br><br>For example Remember the Milk has a gmail gadget for viewing its tasks in gmail.<br><br>Could an autofocus gadget store its data in a mail message for easy viewing offline (perhaps a draft message) or even in a google document or spreadsheet using the google data API?<br><br>Is there anyone reading the forum who's a little more clued up on google gadgets and APIs than me?<br></div>

<div class="content">Gmail has a "task" add-on that would work ok.  I like how when you check something off it draws a line through it and then kind of greys it out so the stuff to still be done is easy to read.  You can move items up or down (instead of re-writing them) and indent if needed (for sub tasks).  One problem is the closed-list aspect of AF.  Since there's no "pages" you don't get that.  A work around would be using the "new list" feature.  Make a different task list when you reach a certain number of items, like 25-30 or so and that would close the lists for you.  It may work for some people, but I get too much satisfaction physically crossing stuff off with a pen.<br><br>If anyone tries it out I'd like to hear how it goes for them.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Jim. It's quite a neat little feature. I'll try it out.<br><br>I wonder if there's any way to access the task lists via the google api. hmmmm</div>

<div class="content">This isn't Gmail, but Google. I played with the idea of used Google docs. Gmail is accessible off-line, don't know about Google docs since I'm not interested in that aspect. I planned to set up 25-30 row tables to mirror pages then highlight, overstrike, copy/paste, whatever to match the paper version. I've decided, though, to stick with pen and paper - which would amaze a lot of my friends since I'm considered the computer guru in my circle (datbases, spreadsheets, betas, you-name-it). But, a pen and paper list just seems to work best at this point.</div>

<div class="content">Topper:<br><br>Google docs is an interesting possibility especially as it's accessible via an API. At the moment there doesn't seem to be any API for accessing gmail tasks.<br><br>For tables in google docs a google spreadsheet would be the way to go I suspect. <br><br>There could be a column for the task name, a column for a status character (empty=not started, . = started like a dot in AF not book, x=done, d=dismissed perhaps). All that would be need after that would be separator rows between the 'pages' which would be groups of rows. Finished pages could be purged by just deleting groups of rows. I think it's possible to do colouring and formatting but that would probably be too time consuming.<br><br>There are applications for accessing google documents and spreadsheets on mobile devices but I don't know how well they work.<br><br>Mike<br><br></div>

<div class="content">It's possible to use the simple mobile version of gmail tasks in a desktop web browser by making your browser pretend to be an iPhone with user agent swicher (see the link below) <br><br><a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/2008/06/28/how-to-emulate-iphone-change-user-agent-in-safari-and-firefox-web-browser/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mydigitallife.info/2008/06/28/how-to-emulate-iphone-change-user-agent-in-safari-and-firefox-web-browser/</a><br><br>It's very fast and effective and uncluttered and easier to use than the gmail tasks window I thought.</div>
