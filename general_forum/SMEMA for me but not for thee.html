<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2013-03-7 14:05</div>
<div class="content">Glad most of the site is back up. But it seems that today's rule from Mark is "SMEMA for me but not for thee." All the SMEMA & PCL blog postings and discussions of the last week or so have been scrubbed from this site.  If you are able to read this posting before it too gets scrubbed, and want to discuss SMEMA on an alternative site, visit <a href="http://timemanagement.freeforums.net" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://timemanagement.freeforums.net</a> (Thanks, Gerry!) and click on the "General Board" link.  There's a SMEMA thread there. . .</div>

<div class="content">And there is quite a robust discussion there (thanks, Gerry!) on SMEMA!</div>

<div class="content">To clarify for anyone that comes here before the blog comments, Mark says:<br><br>"There's nothing to stop you or anyone else using it of course. It's just that it's not recommended by me. I felt that the discussion that the original post caused was far from helpful, and that it would be better to repost it in a more simple and clear-cut way without any of the accompanying baggage.<br><br>I have no objection by the way to anyone starting up a discussion of it on the General Forum, but I don't intend to take part in it myself."<br><br>The new replacement blog post is much simpler, unencumbered by the longer explanation that may have overshadowed the essence.</div>
