<div class="content">When you switch back to AF2, do you recommend reading through your entire list again, like you do when you first start AF2 in the morning?</div>

<div class="content">Bill:<br><br>I haven't found it necessary to read through the whole list at all. I guess I would if I'd been away from the list for an extended period, but with AF1/2 I don't think it's necessary if I'm working on it every day.<br><br>Of course if you feel at any stage that you are loosing track of what's on the list, then by all means read through it.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>NOW I understand your earlier comment to me that  "The new AF1/AF2 Combo which I'm testing at the moment will solve your problem with looking back through 17 pages. "<br><br>Unless I missed it, when you gave us the new rules you didn't tell us that we didn't need to start by reviewing our whole list.  Either way, I have become comfortable (and more productive) with AF2 and I really think it is the review part that helps set the stage each day.  <br><br>If I become comfortable where the list will take me on a given day, I will likely skip the review.  Until then, I think I will keep doing it.<br><br>Thanks for the systems and all your advise.</div>

<div class="content">MartyH:<br><br>I didn't mention it specifically in the new rules because basically I think it's up to the individual to decide whether and how often they want to read the whole list through. It's nothing like as necessary with the new version as it was with AF2.</div>

<div class="content">It might be a good idea to mention it as an optional step.  For me, it seems to let me identify some things I want to accomplish that would otherwise remain lost in the middle of the list.  It sets the stage so to speak.</div>
