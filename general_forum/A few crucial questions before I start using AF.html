<div class="meta">2009-02-27 17:09</div>
<div class="content">Having read about AF I became intrigued to try it out. In order to prepare myself (I'm currently using GTD), I read the FAQ thread. By the way, if anyone's interested to know, that thread runs to more than 81 pages long!<br><br>Although many of my questions were already answered in the FAQ, I still have a few that I need to have answers for, before I make the leap from GTD.<br><br>1. Repeating tasks.<br>Since I travel a lot, I have a checklist of things to do in preparation for every trip. The checklist contains about 15 items, like book hotel, buy tickets, arrange for a taxi to go to the airport etc. I would find it very tedious to have to copy these tasks to my AF notebook for every trip. Is there an alternative solution?<br><br>2. Dependent tasks.<br>If I write out tasks as they come to my head, I may write things down not necessarily in a chronological order. This would probably make it difficult to do the tasks efficiently, if I were to go through the AF list according to the sequence of entry of all tasks. How does AF cope with this possibility?<br><br>3. Write all tasks or just the next task?<br>This is indirectly connected with the above questions. Say, I'm in a brainstorming mood and I determine for a project a number of tasks to be done. Should I write them all down in the AF list, or only the next task (in a chronological sense)?<br><br>4. Agendas/delegated actions<br>If my boss asks me what are the tasks/projects we could talk about, in GTD I would create an @Agenda_Boss context. Similarly I could have a context for discussing matters with my subordinates. How could I achieve a similar result with AF, but without having to scan my entire list of tasks in order to determine what I may have outstanding that would interest my boss or that I would like to discuss with my subordinates, as the case may be?<br><br>The following is a comment not a question:<br>a) I decided to use Mozilla Sunbird portable to record date critical tasks, that is tasks that have to be completed by a certain date. I'll build in a small security buffer, by entering these tasks to be done a few days before the actual deadline.<br><br>b) My biggest failing to date with any system that I tried was that although I was effective at recording next actions (GTD) or tasks, or things to do etc, I invariably used a digital format. This in most cases was a spreadsheet. Although there are advantages in using a digital format (neatly typed, easy to copy and paste etc.), I've come to see that I rarely looked at my list carefully. If I were to print it, I would then have to update the printed version as well as the digital version, which was very time consuming. I therefore applaud the idea of using a handwritten list as AF seems to promote. I'm confident that I'll be more effective using this mode of recording my tasks.</div>

<div class="content">OK: I'll have a shot at these. Comments are my opinion only and come with no guarantees.<br><br>0. Nice Moniker!<br>1. You could put in a task "Travel Checklist Samarkand" or whatever into AF and keep the checklist separately<br>2. You are going through the list so frequently this may not be an issue in practice. AF does not seek to cover project scheduling. I suspect that there is a genuine trade-off between efficiency and focus, though.<br>3.I'd put them all in AF<br>4. Good question. Separate list, like in GTD, is the obvious answer. AF could then have "review agenda for Bob", "Put X on agenda for Bob" or "Go through agenda with Bob"<br><br>a. Yes: put date critical stuff in a diary or project management system<br>b. If you do it properly, you will certainly fix this problem!<br><br>Good luck!!</div>

<div class="content">Most importantly, you can't learn it or evaluate it by reading about it.  It is so closely tied to the way your subconscious works, that you have to just try it.  There is so little overhead, it isn't a big burden to give it a shot for a couple of weeks.<br><br>Anything with a due date or is a scheduled event should be on your calendar so the date won't be missed.  See the post titled "Noting time sensitive AF entries" here for a good discussion of this aspect:<br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/673272#post673956" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/673272#post673956</a></div>

<div class="content">Hi Otto<br><br>As Marty says, the best way to experience how AF works is to try it and I think that, as you suspect, you will find the use of a notebook and pen to be so uncomplicated that it does increase effectiveness.  As a die-hard "electronic wherever possible" person I love my notebook, and have realised that I do actually use paper a lot more than I had realised.  An indication perhaps as to why the "paperless office" has never become a reality!<br><br>The questions you raise are good ones and as someone who has had similar situations I can understand your concerns.  I have posted (probably ad nauseum!) about the advantages of running AF alongside a designated scheduler and a separate project planner, with perhaps the addition of a few carefully selected additional lists and the way I would deal with the above is as follows:<br><br>1) For travel I maintain a separate section within my project system where all pertinant travel related information resides.  That would include checklists, maps, hotel information, city/location information etc.  Within AF I would have the task "Action checklist" which would be included into AF at what I felt to be the appropriate time in advance of the trip, readding it to the list if only partially completed when actioned.  The checklist would be outside AF, actioning it would be within AF.  <br><br>2) I add all tasks to the list as they come to mind regardless of dependency.  When I come to a task that has a dependancy, then that in itself acts as a reminder, and I believe sub-conscioulsy prepares next steps.  When I come to the item on which it was dependant then that item is more likely to stand out, having been more mentally prepared.  However, sometimes I will also keep a separate list of those items, normally as part of my project planning, but sometimes just as a sort of checklist.  The extent to which I do that would be very much dependent upon the task in question but, as it would be more likely to be a task I would consider as a project, then it is for me a natural part of my project system anyway.<br><br>3) For me this varies immensely and I think you will find as you start using AF that you will intuitively know when you need to write just the next action or all of the actions. Sometimes I work with adding just the "next action", sometimes several actions, and sometimes the entire project itself, where it would be more of a timeblock (but still actioned when standing out in AF) and working from my project list. It is perfectly common when using that approach to find that, as you work through your lists, certain tasks have already been actioned by the time you reach them (and it is also common to find that some items get listed more than once!).<br><br>4) I action this scenario in two ways, one of which is pure AF and the other by use of my digital approach (which is personal preference and not therefore part of my paper system).  For any task that needs to be collated, eg tasks for discussion with a colleague, shopping lists, project lists etc., I will have a task to add it to a separate list.  Adding a task to a list takes seconds and therefore usually gets actioned on the first pass of a page anyway (or you could just add it at the same time as adding to AF but that way it can get forgotten if you are not in the same place as those lists).  My digital solution is in OneNote where I just tag the relevent items so can extract and print a list of just those items at any time I require. My OneNote lists are very low overhead timewise, but that is my personal preference and is not in any way necessary to AF.  The pure AF method is perfectly workable.    <br><br>Hope some of those ideas help ........ <br></div>

<div class="content">Thank you very much Christine for such a detailed reply. Needless to say, your postings are among those that I invariably read with great interest.<br><br>I'm pleased to see that the use of checklists outside the AF, but with a link to them from the AF, is a suggested solution. What worries me is to ensure that a time critical action will not fall through the system and be discovered too late. However, as you said so many times, I'll have to try the system in order to see in practice how it works and then whatever reservations I have should disappear.<br><br>You wrote that "It is perfectly common when using that approach to find that, as you work through your lists, certain tasks have already been actioned by the time you reach them (and it is also common to find that some items get listed more than once!)." I'm willing to accept this as a minor issue, because it's better than the alternative of missing out actions that ought to have been taken, but were missed out instead!<br><br>The maintenance of tasks in OneNote is for my personal circumstances a weak point. I would ideally prefer to keep things listed in one place only. I'll think about it a little longer and I will come back with any ideas.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Otto, and thank you for the compliment.<br><br>What I've found from using AF is that the process seems to go through stages, and having been "in the forum" as it were from the beginning, those stages seem to be fairly consistent.  As you will no doubt have gathered from the posts, the "hidden" aspect of AF, namely the intuitive aspect and the way it which one is encouraged to look deeper than "overload" to one's personal feelings surrounding tasks, is something that is hard to define, and the speed at which it impacts individuals does appear to vary.  However there do seem to be points at which we all hit similar concerns, and the fear of missing time critical items is a very real issue. <br><br>There are a number of suggestions within the site; some people tag those items within their lists, some write the due date, and the use of specific items being extracted onto an index card is also a suggested solution.  For me, and again I am speaking from personal experience here, tags and written due dates seemed to inhibit the scan of items, in that they were effectively grading the items which AF does not encourage.  I tried the index card approach but that was also with limited success, although I do periodically extract items onto another piece of paper (or tag them in OneNote).  What I find however is that I rarely change my approach, even if I have extracted those items.  It seems that the very act of extraction itself influences the subconscious sufficiently to ensure completion.<br><br>Sometimes, if particular items are causing me concern I will just write them into my lists, even though I know they are already there somewhere or other.  I could just move through my lists more quickly but that has never felt "right" to me.  In actual fact I see the fact that tasks have sometimes been completed by the time I reach a page, or that a task has been duplicated, not as a failure of the system, but an aid to motivation in itself.  When I turn over to a completely new page of items, finding that I can immediately tick off three or four of them gets that page started quickly, and I will normally go on to complete maybe another 10-15 items on the page.<br><br>While you are getting used to AF, the best advice I can give you is to (a) remember the Common sense rule - if something is time critical and needs doing now, then do it now! - and (b) make sure you are constantly reviewing your lists.  That way you will always know what is in there and are unlikely to miss things. <br><br>There also seems to be a point around the 15 or so active pages mark, when panic about the speed of movement through the pages, number of pages etc., hits.  All of these things do settle down :-)<br><br>Regarding OneNote as I say that is my personal approach and just naturally ties in with my project management system and schedule, which I keep in OneNote anyway.  Do remember that AF is for discretionery time, and is a tool to get things done.  It is not in itself a scheduler, neither is it a project management system.  Both of those areas need to be handled outside of the system although managed by the system.  Mark refers to the difference between managing the project and managing yourself within the project.<br><br>Finally, be aware that AF may give unusual indications.  Just because a project is deadlined does not mean it will stand out - those are the times when it is immensely hard to trust the system because, well it doesn't seem to tie in with the Common Sense rule.  At the end of the day, only you can make the ultimate decisions and your decisions will inevitably be impacted by the level to which you have experienced the benefits of AF by the time those decisions need to be made.  All I can say is that, for me, in two very specific cases where "the system" was apparently contradictory to common sense, the system was right and the lessons learned as a result were invaluable.  <br><br>Well that's probably more than enough for you to be going on with, so, time to get started! ..... :-)  Best of luck ....</div>

<div class="content">Thank you again. Your writing goes beyond a simple commentary about the system: It's truly a coaching session, much needed by a person newly starting in AF, like myself. For that I'm very grateful. I'll add a few more tasks to my "Home" list for AF, and then I'll also start populating a "Work" AF list.<br><br>As I wrote earlier, I'm in transition from GTD and the change will take some getting used to. I'm ready and willing to be patient with AF, but even more so I'll be tolerant with it, and give it a chance to work.</div>

<div class="content">Otto,<br>I admire your first reading before asking. Really admire. I don't think AF is the best option for everyone but if you try as Seraphim said in another post is just as difficult as grabbing a pen and a notebook.<br><br>And, of course, such a good thread should  go to FAQ, too.</div>
