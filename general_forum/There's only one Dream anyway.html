<div class="content">Peace, love and happiness are the one dream of us all perhaps, so I wonder what would happen if I used the condensed "Dreams" process on that. I'm wondering if it would bring contented happiness in a Buddhist like state or an active expression of my talents and abilities. i feel a bit of a dilemma over peace as active or accepting. Perhaps I shall experiment on my own living.</div>

<div class="content">You have been working with the Dreams process for a week or so. Has your Future Reality developed in that direction? If not, where are you getting the idea that you really want peace, love and happiness?<br><br>There's no reason why you can't use peace, love and happiness as your initial starting point, but don't forget that the Future Reality is supposed to change and develop so that you discover what you really want.<br><br>Looking at the development of my Future Reality, I have just taken peace out of it as I discovered it didn't reflect what I wanted. I took love (in the form of friendship) out at an early stage. And I've never felt any inclination to put happiness in.<br><br>It may well be that at some stage they will all feature, but it's got to be because they have been through the process, not because I feel they are what I ought to want.</div>

<div class="content">Good points Mark.  My Future Reality moved away from what I thought I ought to want when I used the "Something I want from life now is..." It's now pointing in the right direction I feel. the valuable discovery in that was how my "ought to" side hiiacked things temporarily.</div>
