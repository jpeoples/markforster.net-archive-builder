<div class="content">Hi friends - I'm an indie dev building https://www.focumon.com<br><br>For the longest time I was on the quest to find the perfect gamified productivity app to finally decide to build one myself! The core concept is heavily Pokemon inspired - you take a little monster with you into a multi-player training center to focus with, and it gains EXP and can be evolved!<br><br>I launched Focumon a few months ago and have been rolling out new features and improvements non-stop. A friend in my community recently introduced me to FV/FVP and I realized that Focumon has all the necessary tools for y'all to apply this protocol! Super curious what you all think about it and looking forward to feedback on how I can make Focumon better for y'all.<br><br>Cheers,<br>milton</div>

<div class="content">Well, this might be blatant self promotion, but it sure is a cute idea. Very cute, and very on point as far as the art style goes.</div>

<div class="content">I might try it later to answer my own questions, but I wonder:<br><br>1. how much time do the game aspects take up compared to working with the lists (I guess that would include launching the app to get into it)<br><br>2. how does the task list work. How much can you see at a time and can you "dot" them in order to go through them FVP style<br><br>That brings up a related concern, does anyone else get totally distracted (or figured out a solution) by whatever else is on their phone if you pick it up to do something productive, and see an urgent text or whatever?</div>

<div class="content">Don R<br><br><< does anyone else get totally distracted (or figured out a solution) by whatever else is on their phone if you pick it up to do something productive, and see an urgent text or whatever>><br><br>Nope, no clue what you're talking about /s<br><br>I have Freedom installed on all of my devices. I have recurring sessions through the day where I block YouTube (I only allow myself one hour in the afternoon). I have Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, etc blocked all day/night. <br><br>Even still, paper/pen is what I use to capture notes, Scatter Maps (yes Mark, I'm still making good use out of that tool), etc. <br><br>For me - it's the ol' "If you don't want to eat a whole package of Oreo cookies at night, don't keep them in your house".</div>

<div class="content">Hi, since I am the user who brought up FVP in the Focumon community and thankfully Milton made some changes in order to use it easier in the app, i will try to answer:<br><br><< 1. how much time do the game aspects take up compared to working with the lists (I guess that would include launching the app to get into it)<br><br>1) not much extra time - you choose your focus companion (monster/pokemon) and the focus area at the beginning of a session, and thats it. A session can last up to 8 hours. If one likes the gamification one can of course evolve & level-up the monsters, or participate in group quests etc. - but thats all quickly done and not in any way needed during work sessions.<br><br><< 2. how does the task list work. How much can you see at a time and can you "dot" them in order to go through them FVP style<br><br>2) The list of all tasks is showing (i guess) around 50 tasks per page. Its ordered by time changed, therefor can be used for FVP. It can consist various sublists ("quests") which feed into the main list. <br>You can dot them in two ways: either pin them onto the top of the list in a separate area, or push them into the "stack", which is then the list you constantly see while being in a focus session. There one can as well allocate time-estimates to the tasks, in order to get some sort of overview how long it all might take. <br><br>For my FVP procedure i usually push the tasks into the stack, and use the pinning feature for tasks which are urgent / time-sensitive or important. But one could do it otherwise as well i guess.<br><br>Cheers, Andreas</div>
