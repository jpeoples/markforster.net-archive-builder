<div class="content">1. Use a page-a-day diary or journal book. <br><br>2. Draw a vertical line down the middle of the page.<br><br>3. The left side of the page is your "maybe" list.  <br><br>4. The right side of the page is your "hot list".<br><br>5. When you start the day, you would normally have many items on today's "maybe" list, and nothing on the "hot list".<br><br>6. Process by cycling through all the items on today's page -- both the "maybe" list and the (growing) "hotlist".  Work on anything that stands out.  <br>     ○ If you take action, and complete the item -- just cross it off.  <br>     ○ If the item needs more attention (either recurring or unfinished), then re-enter the item on today's "hot list" list.   <br>     ○ However, if the item needs to be re-entered but is "done for today", you can enter it on the *next* day's "maybe" list.   <br>     ○ In cases where you really can't take any more action for several days (for example, you sent off an email and expect 2-3 days to get a reply; or it's a recurring item and you don't need to see the task again for a week), then re-enter the item as many days ahead as needed -- on that day's "maybe" list.<br><br>7. When nothing else stands out on today's page, then you can scan forward through future pages, taking action on anything that stands out.  Follow the same re-entry rules for unfinished items as above.<br><br>8. After going through the future pages, go back to the oldest page in your book that still has active tasks.  Treat these pages just like AF1 pages -- i.e., if you take no action on a visit to a page, all remaining items are dismissed.<br><br>9. After completing an old page (either by taking action on something, or by dismissing that page), you have the option of moving forward to the next old AF1 page, OR jumping directly forward to today's page.  Use the same re-entry rules for these old AF1 pages as you do for the today page.<br><br>10. Today's page cannot be dismissed -- it's like the last page in an AF1 notebook.<br><br>11. The normal, default place to put new things is on TOMORROW's "maybe" list.<br>     ○ However, if a new item is urgent and needs attention today, put it on today's hot list.<br>     ○ If a new item cannot be started till the future, then put it on the future date's maybe list.  Don't abuse this -- if you defer items to the future merely because tomorrow is already looking full, I have a feeling the system will break.<br><br>12. At the end of the day, move whatever you want from today's hotlist to tomorrow's maybe list.   Leave everything else on the page alone.  Then you are done for the day.  (Ahhh, what a nice feeling!)<br><br>13. If you like, at the beginning of the day, you can take a quick scan or two through today's maybe list, and put a dot or a circle or other mark next to the items you think are probably "hot" for today.   Or, you can just rely entirely on the standing out process.  Whichever you prefer.<br>	<br><br>This seems pretty similar to what I posted earlier.  Here are some additional observations:<br><br>1. The explanation of the rules is vastly simplified.<br><br>2. There are a lot fewer choices to make.  Unactioned items typically remain where they are; thus, there isn't the reliance on "negative standing out" to decide when to "move a task somewhere else".  <br><br>3. It does not include project pages -- though these could be included pretty easily by using blank pages at the beginning or end of the notebook.<br><br>4. The focus of one's work tends to be on today's hotlist.<br><br>5. Splitting the list into "Maybe" and "Hotlist" seems to make a key difference vs DIT or DIT+(AF1 on old pages).  The "Maybe" stuff is merely a list of tasks for your consideration - there is no implied commitment, until you take some action on it and move it to the hotlist.  This would seem to create a lot more freedom and sense of flow.<br>	<br>Alternate approach to dismissal:  You could use DWM-style dismissal -- anything over 30 days old is dismissed automatically.   <br>	<br>Caveat:  I haven't tried any of this yet -- I just wanted to capture this brainstorm before I go to bed.  I will try it tomorrow, if I can wrangle these ideas into a OneNote structure.  :-)</div>

<div class="content">I have been following DWM2 for a while as I like the timed dismissal to spur me to get on with few tasks that are in danger of being dismissed! But, I do keep coming back to the idea of Today's list. There have been times when I would cull some key tasks from DWM2 and place them on a separate "today" list to work on them. I also like the idea of legitimately moving certain tasks to a future date (within the system rather than outside the system) to heed to the time-based context explicitly. <br><br>I tried TODAY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY setup but I couldn't sustain it after sometime and I went back to DWM2. Now, I have been trying your method for the last 2 days and I really like it. <br><br>However, I have added a few wrinkles. I have added the timed dismissal aspect of DWM2 - both for the unactioned items (30 day dismissal as you mention) as well as the actioned items (7 day dismissal). Obviously my testing timeframe is not sufficient to see how this works out. But, I feel comfortable that the DWM2 timed dismissal (which i have found to work for me well) will translate well here. I mark all actioned items so any items in the DATED lists with a mark that is 7 days old gets dismissed. While there is an element of compulsion with this dismissal, I have adopted it because it has worked for me before. Also, it might eliminate the stragglers that bounce around and linger on (as Mark mentioned in the earlier thread). This type of dismissal I feel can coexist with AF1 type dismissal. I will experiment with this for the next few weeks.<br><br>I also have decided to move any tasks left behind in TODAY at the end of the day to DATED close list, instead of moving them to NEW. Once an item moves to TODAY, it means that it has been committed. If the commitment continues to be there, then the task will move to FUTURE pages. If the commitment has dwindled, then it makes sense to move it to a DATED page. I am not sure how the dynamic plays out compared to your method of moving them to NEW page.<br><br>BTW, I also use Onenote for this system and I do have iPhone version for mobility. I use the mobile version primarily as read only list and add any new item into it when I am not near the pc. Right now the pages unfortunately cannot move in the mobile version which would make it more versatile.<br><br>So far I have really liked the flow of this system and I have been able to get a lot done. I have a clear picture of what I am doing "today" and it gives me a sense of accomplishment at the end of the day. <br><br>GC</div>

<div class="content">Mark Forster wrote:<br><br><< Gosh! Even I didn't get second versions out as quickly as that! >><br><br>Well, that's because you are a lot more thorough, and your systems are a lot more elegant and can serve a much broader userbase than mine, plus you do a lot more testing before publishing something.  :-)    I am more selfish and am publishing these so I can get faster feedback from this excellent community and incorporate the best ideas that make sense to me.<br><br>Also, the way this whole thing has evolved for me has been very organic, lots of "little and often" improvements on a basic theme.   This revision is not a whole lot different than what I've been doing for months now.<br><br>That basic theme has been:<br>	- Cycle through series of pages, taking action on whatever stands out<br>	- Pages follow the "free form" model:  AF1-like pages interspersed with project pages, "recurring weekly" pages, reference pages, or whatever happens to make sense at the time, like a TODAY page<br>	- Move things forward in some way, if you take action on them<br>	- Dismiss things if they’ve been sitting around too long or are cluttering up the rest of the system<br>	- Adapt the specific form to your current needs -- try new page types, try new dismissal methods, don't be stuck with any particular rules, just KEEP CYCLING THROUGH <br>	<br>The constant cycling has been such an important key -- frequent repeated exposure to all my outstanding work, allowing tasks to percolate till they are ready, or till it becomes clear they are no longer relevant.<br><br>Eventually some page types and other structures became "permanent fixtures" -- such as the TODAY page.<br><br>Reflecting on the way things were going, and why it was working so well, and what some of the downsides were, led me to write the "AutoDIT" post.   My hope was to share something that worked well for me --maybe someone else would benefit from it -- but also to get feedback that might help me improve the weak spots.   And I got that feedback very quickly, especially from you and Alan.<br><br>That resulted in the Revision 2 rewrite, which is mostly just a clarification of Revision 1, with a few ambiguities clarified, but not really a whole new system.</div>

<div class="content">seraphim:<br>to be clear, when there is no more room on todays maybe list, do you simple spill over to tomorrows maybe list?  or are items on todays maybe list, tomorrows, or January 8ths list items you really hope to touch that day?  in other words, does the maybe side of the list function like column 1 of superfocus only broken up by dates?  <br><br>thanks<br>Brett</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim's posts have helped clarify my fumbling. For my part here's my planned OneNote adaptation:<br>Each maybe page will be titled by its date. <br>Today's hotlist will be named ACT(ive) .<br>At the end of the day, tasks remaining on today's hotlist will be shunted to tomorrow's maybe list, and ACT will be moved to after Today's maybe list.<br><br>Brett:<br>I think if a page gets full, I would continue on the next page, ahead of schedule, but usually this won't happen. I think pages are like SF1 column 1.  Although they are dated, there is no expectation to do all those things on those dates.  There is however a sense that these items will become more prominent as the date arrives, and less prominent after that date, and so today's maybes stand out more strongly to do today.</div>

<div class="content">brettypooh wrote:<br><br><< to be clear, when there is no more room on todays maybe list, do you simple spill over to tomorrows maybe list? >><br><br>To be honest, since I implement this in OneNote, I don't really have a limit.  <br><br>With paper, I suppose you could overflow the Maybe items to the next day.   This would become a chronic issue and clog up the system, if you are frequently overflowing to the next day like this.   And I don't see a way to limit it via the mechanics of the system.  You could "audit your commitments" to try to reduce the incoming tasks, but that's not automatic enough for my tastes.<br><br>Thus, I think it'd be preferable to get a notebook with bigger pages, or something along those lines, so you ensure you can cram all your tasks onto the one page for that day.<br><br><br> << or are items on todays maybe list, tomorrows, or January 8ths list items you really hope to touch that day? >><br><br>No, I don't necessarily expect to touch all the items that day.  The point is that I want the items I don't touch to become "AF1" pages that get cycled for awhile and then dismissed if no action is taken.   Overflowing to future pages both clogs up the future pages (making them less responsive to current needs), and it also defers the cycling/dismissal process.</div>

My own hard thinking doesn't appear to be up to the task, however, which is why I've started these threads.  :-)<br><br>Regarding the "unspecified something", the first thing that comes to mind is the number of items per page.  I suppose you might mean that you can define this as "close the last page at the end of the day".  But simply doing that would not give you the ability to differentiate between items you want to see again today, items you want to defer to the future, and items you don't really care when you see next.  <br><br>Perhaps you referred to the tickler system for items that must wait till some future date to be started, which AF1 leaves unspecified.   You could consider the future pages as just another tickler system.   But even so, this still does not create the equivalence of AutoDIT's focus on TODAY, the ability to know when a day's work is complete, etc.<br><br>Maybe you mean something else -- anyone else have any ideas?<br><br>I see the key difference between AF1 and AutoDIT as being AutoDIT's multiple entry points:<br><br>- With AutoDIT, new urgent items are entered directly onto today's hotlist.  AF1 does not handle urgent items in any special way, and this is the main weakness of AF1.<br><br>- AutoDIT provides future pages for entry of items that cannot start until some future date.  AF1 offloads these items to an unspecified tickler system.  <br><br>- AutoDIT provides at least two entry points for re-entry of unfinished items after you take some action on them.  You can enter them on today's hotlist (if you want to see it again today); on a future maybe list (if you don't want to see it again till some future date, for some particular reason); or on tomorrow's maybe list (if you don't have any place else to put it).    AF1 doesn't differentiate these at all -- everything goes at the end.</div>

<div class="content">I give up on what's missing. My best guess is Mark's being literal about the wording of a rule, discounting what is generally assumed implied. I also think there's a great deal to be said for format. Even given a set of rules, it matters a great deal how easily they can be followed, physically etc.</div>

<div class="content">I was thinking about this some more while driving around this afternoon.<br><br>It seems that if you make these two changes to AF1, then you arrive at AutoDIT:<br><br>	- Close the last page at the end of the day -- not when it actually fills up.  This would be an actual rule change.<br><br>	- Incorporate the TOMORROW page and all the other future pages as your tickler system -- which isn't specified in the AF1 rules.<br>	<br>You can also count the "maybe" list and the "hot" list as really just one list.   When you start the day, everything will be on the maybe list.  As you process things, the items that see some action can move to the hotlist.   This can be simplified.  When you start the day, just draw a line under the items that are on the list so far.   Add any new items below the line.  Also, re-enter items you want to see today, below the line.   The line itself isn't even necessary - it's just a useful visual clue to show you activity that occurred after the start of the day, and it has a parallel in DIT.<br><br>Looking at it this way, AutoDIT really is just a variant of AF1 with a variable page length and a built-in tickler system.   AF1 already allows you to move an item, after you've taken some action, either to the last page (which would be the TODAY page), or to the Tickler system.   The TOMORROW page is really just part of the Tickler system.<br><br><br>But now, looking at Mark's latest comments, this isn't what he had in mind - there's something else that he has in mind that makes this exactly AF1 if you specify something that wasn't specified.  I will go scour the AF1 rules again and see if I can find it...</div>

I still take excursions through the older tasks, but they don't have nearly as much appeal -- the current tasks have a much stronger draw.

If I was processing page 10, and entering new items on page 15 (which was a typical situation for me), the current tasks just weren't fresh in my mind -- I was always deferring them to "later".   I was always finding lots of things to do on page 10.  After a few days, I might actually arrive at page 15 (while entering new items on page 21), and still find plenty of things to do, especially because now whatever items were still current, were pressing and urgent because I had taken so long to get to them.    <br><br>This always being behind, was a self-perpetuating problem.   If I was processing page 10, and new items were going onto page 15, it was abundantly clear that I might not get back to page 10 again for a very long time.    So, I'd better do whatever needs doing on page 10 NOW.   So I'd spend more time there than I might if I had confidence I could actually come back to that page pretty soon again.<br><br>Sometimes I would just jump ahead to the last page so I could stay current, but after a few days, I'd fall behind again.

AF1 doesn't specify those, but that fact wouldn't be a surprise -- many times in the past, you've discussed the fact that AF1 doesn't tell you this, and in fact you recommend in the rules themselves to set a strict STOP time for yourself because AF1 will just keep drawing you in.<br><br>The system does NOT specify what to do with dismissed items.   The rules talk about how not to re-enter them without due consideration, but it doesn't really give a process for handling them, for what TO do with them.

But in any case, I don't see how this applies here, and I don’t think this is the "unspecified something" that Mark meant.</div>

<div class="content">Could it be that the rules don't specify where to start each day?<br><br>Considering the recommendation to "DO put the date next to the first item you add each day", by starting each day on the last page you'd be working on the fresh and current stuff you've added the previous day. <br><br>I first thought it was the cycling direction that wasn't specified in the rules and the working the pages backwards would keep the AF1 flow focused on the most recent stuff, but the forward direction is implied by the rule: "Once you’ve finished with the final page, re-start at the first page that is still active."<br><br>Close? :)</div>

<div class="content">Alan:<br><br>"I insist on a separate cycle of only Unfinished-continuing-now and Urgent."<br><br>Why? What advantage does it give? New tasks are often quite urgent, more so than many unfinished tasks, and they may be follow-ons to previously finished tasks too. And what about daily recurring tasks? Do they need their own cycle too? Aren't you just adding additional layers of complexity?<br><br>The criteria for the "hot list" is that the items are fresh and current, which means the list doesn't get so bogged down in stuff which hasn't moved for ages. Like DIT, AF1 makes this list for you automatically - an absolute minimum of system overhead.</div>

<div class="content">New tasks are quite often urgent.  But also many are non-urgent distractions.  By keeping them separate, I gain a clear vision of what I'm trying to accomplish today.  If a new urgency appears, it will be added to the clear vision, but if a new non-urgent appears, it won't detract from that vision.  Daily recurring tasks are also separated for exactly the same reason.  <br><br>As for complexity, it really isn't much because even with these features the process is just:<br>Write here, reenter there, cycle around doing things.  I guess this puts it just below AF4R on the complexity scale.</div>

<div class="content">I have been starting AF each day at the beginning of the previous day's entries for about 2 years now. I referred to it obliquely in the following thread from May 2010: <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1089439" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1089439</a> .<br><br>It works very well, and I can recommend it. The only danger is that you can sometimes get stuck at the business end of the list, and some of the older tasks can get very old due to not cycling through the list. I get round this problem by adding a task "Cycle entire list" when I get the feeling that older pages may be getting neglected. When this task stands out, I aim to get round the list very quickly, doing a little bit on each page or dismissing entire pages as necessary.<br><br>I did wonder if this was what Mark was getting at earlier in the thread, but decided it was a tweak and therefore an addition to the rules. I am still not sure it is covered by the existing rules. <br><br>I remember asking a couple of years ago if this technique would alter the dynamics of the system, but I can't find the post -- I may have posted under a different name back when we didn't need to log in...<br><br>[I've corrected the link which did not work because you didn't leave a gap between the end of the link and the following punctuation point.

<div class="content">Wooba, if each day you start at yesterday's entries, then progress through today, then the oldest page or two, then quit: it seems to me the old pages will quickly be eliminated and you will progressively get to less-old pages. Are there pages you don't ever get to?  Or does it just take too long to reach them?  If that's the case, I think you had too many tasks and you need to be more aggressive dismissing them.</div>

Thus everything new goes into the tickler for tomorrow.  I think a case could be made that this is still pure AF1, just an unusual approach to using the tickler.  I'll try that for a couple days at least, and see if it improves.<br><br>(3) If I am still missing the TODAY effect even after that, then I may introduce something like the TODAY Maybe List and the TODAY Hotlist, to separate the active hot tasks from the rest of the stuff on the today list.   This would now be breaking away from AF1 and getting closer to the AutoDIT rules.</div>

I think the AutoDIT rules, as I originally posted them, and also as posted at the top of this thread, are pretty close to what you had started doing independently.   But this thread has taken several turns and twists, and I've mentioned a few other variations, and Mark has mentioned some as well, and now I am actively testing something very different (though Mark claims it is nearly identical in the end).

<div class="content">Alan,<br><br>The danger that I mentioned is quite rare. I think it happens when I have a few big tasks and work on them little-and-often for a few days. The result is I get stuck at the more recent end of the list, and need to remind myself to cycle the list properly. Productivity doesn't suffer, it is just some old things on the list that get older than I would like. A quick whiz round the entire list soon sorts things out. I think this was an issue with AF4, too. Or was it AF2? I can't remember.</div>
