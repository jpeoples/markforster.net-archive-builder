<div class="content">I've just started to try this system and I'm getting bogged down at the first page.  How do you move on to later pages if you only have a little bit of time a day to do things on the list?<br><br>Every time I open the notebook I end up at the first page scanning for an item to do and usually there's something.  I haven't looked at the following 5 pages yet and it's been about a week.<br><br>Any suggestions?</div>

<div class="content">@Sqril<br><br>Exactly why is this a problem? You say you keep finding stuff to do on the first page. So, that's good, right? Why do you care what page a "stand out" task is on?<br><br>Is it because you know there are urgent/time-sensitive tasks on the subsequent pages?<br><br>Tommy<br></div>

<div class="content">One thing to keep in mind about AF is that you only have to do one thing on a page before moving on to the next one. And you only have to do that one thing for as long as you feel like, which can be a few minutes.<br><br>So, if you feel you've been stuck on page one for too long, this is what you can do the next time you pull out your AF notebook:<br><br>1. Choose an item on page one.<br><br>2. Work on that item for as long as you want. (Could be 5 or 10 minutes.)<br><br>3. Cross it out (and add it to the end of your notebook if it isn't finished). <br><br>4. Move on to page two. <br><br>And, to keep from getting stuck on another page, you can set a limit on how many items you'll work on on each page before moving on. <br><br>You should also examine why you got stuck on page one. Was it really because items on that page kept standing out to you? Or was it because you felt you *should* do them?</div>

<div class="content">@Deej,<br><br>> One thing to keep in mind about AF is that you only have to do <br>> one thing on a page before moving on to the next one. <br><br>I don't think that's quite correct. If you want to follow the system as defined, you should not move onto the next page until you're unable to find a "stand out" item on the current page. Mark's wording is:<br><br>"Continue going round the same page in the same way. Don’t move onto the next page until you complete a pass of the page without any item standing out"<br><br>Tommy<br></div>

<div class="content">When you come back to work on your list, don't start on page 1.  Start back up where you left off.  If you get to page 3 and need to stop, the next time you work on your list, you are starting on page 3, not on page 1.</div>

But another aspect of AF I like is that it's okay to "cheat" every once in a while in order to make the system work better for you and your individual situation. And, better still, the whole thing won't fall apart just because you didn't follow the rules exactly.<br><br>And I actually think I've seen Mark suggest limiting the number of items you work on per page in order to move through your notebook faster. But I could be wrong about that one.</div>

<div class="content">I'm with Deej. If I suspect there's something important going Priority Red on a subsequent page, I do just one thing on Page One and then go hunting.<br><br>Justification is straight from Mark, though. If something is red-hot urgent, you are allowed to use your common sense and do it right away.<br><br>Remember what the cab driver said in the old story, "Sometimes you have to forget your principles and do the right thing."<br><br>But I also agree with the poster who said maybe you have too many lines per page. I've cut back from 25 to 20 and like the results. That doesn't mean 20 is good for everyone, but maybe it's worth a try for you.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the suggestions.<br><br>I think the one item per page thing might work for me to get past the initial hump.  There aren't too many items on the page - it's just when I listed items initially - I listed a lot of time consuming projects on the first page.  But farther on are things like "mail package to x".  If I followed the system to a T that package would take weeks to get mailed.  (I already mail it btw)<br><br>What might work as I go back to the list is the "little and often" concept.  If I can just do *something* on each item that is bogging me down and move it to the end then I can move forward.<br><br>The deal is - I only have an hour maybe two a day where I doing any of this stuff and I feel like I have to do pieces just to move forward but then I run out of time and fail to get to the next page of the list. Perhaps it's just getting used to the AF mode.</div>

<div class="content">I think it's mostly because of the little time I spend doing tasks and perhaps the wording I'm choosing to use that bogs me down (or I choose to let bog me down).<br><br>For instance "read something you own" is on page one.  So I'm now reading a book that I own but the task isn't done. <br><br>As I undertand it, using AF, I read some, mark it off and add it to the end.  <br><br>But once I start reading it's something that I do all the time (ok off and on - on subway, walking, after work, etc.) and I don't even look at the list to read it (nor should I I don't think).  The task was an impetus to get me to just read something I own rather then read library books  (I like books). <br><br>Maybe I should just rename the task "Start reading something you own" and be done with it.  That fits better with the system and I won't feel as if I need to look a the list to read my book.<br><br>Thanks for the FAQ link - I've been lurking here for a bit trying to get the hang of things.</div>

<div class="content">Sqril<br><br>I think that a task such as you mention is one that can be put back on the list or not as you feel appropriate.  In the case of reading a book it is normally the getting started - once you have done that then you will probably continue naturally without the list - if not then you can readd it.<br><br>If you add a number of small items to your list to get momentum going that may also help - I would suggest using a combination of the one item and the little and often approach as a means of moving through the pages so you don't stagnate and you will probably find it starting to flow more easily.  If you only have small amounts of discretionery time, then at least make sure you are regularly reviewing your lists as you will probably find that you have quite naturally actioned a number of items anyway when you next get back to your lists.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-02-21 1:19</div>
<div class="content">I'm going to take the contrary position here... I don't think that deciding WHAT tasks to add to the list based on how you are finding the list problematic is the way to go.  The spirit of AF is that you throw everything at it and let the system sort it out.  If you start artificially altering the complexity of tasks to make the system work, they there is something else going wrong that should be addressed.<br><br>I think that altering page length or implementing a rule (temporarily) to do only ONE item per page is a better way to solve the problem.  One reason is that once you have the system tweaked THAT way, the system will run well for you without adding a layer of complexity to it.<br><br>Just a thought.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-02-21 2:05</div>
<div class="content">Hi Mike<br><br>I certainly don't disagree with you in so far as grading tasks, but what I do think, is that it is important to have small and routine tasks within the lists and I believe they can be a natural aid to momentum. I think when we first start AF, that our initial understanding of AF will be that we are working with a "to do list", and not only that, but I think we will all have a preconception as to what a "to do" list is.  It takes using the system to realise that AF is in fact very different, (and most of us probably had very different items on our first page to those that go onto our lists by page 10).<br><br>My natural (pre-AF) use of "to do" lists would vary immensely according to what type of list it was - a project to do list would include large time-consuming items, a pre-holiday checklist would have small items such as "set video" which would not form part of a normal daily list.  DIT items would inevitably be work related, home type items would rarely get to a list.<br><br>Sqril says "it's just when I listed items initially - I listed a lot of time consuming projects on the first page. But farther on are things like "mail package to x"."   I would venture to suggest that most of us had items of the "project" type on our first page and it can take some time to identify the ability of the system to deal with resistance, whether by using rephrasing or by an intuitive realisation of other factors at play.  It is a lot easier for that process to become apparent with the smaller items which I really believe helps to get the whole elusive intuitive action of AF flowing.  I think that, not only can it take a little time to get used to throwing everything at AF, but also that that is initially more true of the routine items than the work type items.<br><br>Hope that makes some sense....... :-)<br><br></div>

<div class="meta">2009-02-21 2:41</div>
<div class="content">Yes, I understand what you are saying, I just disagree.  The whole point of AF is to let IT do the sorting, not preselect and presort items to make the list work.  If the list does not seem to work, then one has to find out why that is.<br><br>Just my opinion.</div>
<h2>Reply by Christine B</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-02-21 3:18</div>
<div class="content">Hi Mike<br><br>No problem with you disagreeing with me :-) but I'm not suggesting preselecting or presorting, just ensuring that there is a mix of items. A lot of people have found difficulty where there are only large time consuming items and my suggestion was aimed at that aspect which had been mentioned.<br><br>When you say "If the list does not seem to work, then one has to find out why that is" I absolutely agree with you.  However, and this is only in my personal experience, the process of identifying resistance is a lot less threatening when it relates to a small "unimportant" item.  The identification of the reason for my resistance to "unstacking the dishwasher" was not just a revelation to me but started the whole process of looking at reasons for resistance.  I did not feel threatened by examining that resistance with regard to the dishwasher but had it been an item of more importance I may have felt too threatened by the implications to examine it, and may just have forced myself to do the item "because it was important".<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine,<br><br>A couple of things here, first a nit ... <br><br>"I'm not suggesting preselecting or presorting, just ensuring that there is a mix of items."<br><br>But that is exactly what "ensuring that there is a mix" is doing ... preselecting.  ;-)<br><br>But to the more important point... if you put in a task that is overwhelming, doing part of it is allowed, and encouraged and well within the rules.  IOW, you start on it, "finding the phone book" for example, and then write it down again to resume work on it.<br><br>It is all in how you break it down and phrase it.  You could write "Call Joe" or "Find phone book".  It all depends.  Or, you could just write "Get Info on X" and leave it to your understanding of the project to tell you that you have to get it from Joe, you have to Call him, and if you are overwhelmed by the task, Find the Phonebook.  <br><br>One thing that some of the GtD people are big on is clear outcomes.  And I'm all for that but not if it is more trouble than it is worth.  I could write pages of stuff on getting the information on X, or just write down "Get info on X" and know the rest.<br><br>The biggest complaint about GtD is the overhead and I think that some of that is not so much brought on by GtD as in the various suggestions about how some people find they need to clutter it up because ... well, just because that is who they are.<br><br>In fact, at the beginning I was afraid that was where Mark was going with his rule to cross it off and write it down again at the end of the list.  How dumb is that?  Here we go again with the OCD nonsnese.  But, unless the item is already ON the last page (and there I really DO draw the line ;-) crossing it off and moving it does serve a real purpose.<br><br>However, I've resigned my membership in the "break it down into infinitesimally small bits" club and now just put down whatever seems to tell me what I need to do but does not overwhelm.<br><br>So basically all tasks are whatever size you want them to be ... large, small, complex, easy.  It is just a question of how much of which part of them you decide to work on ;-}</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike<br><br>You have said "So basically all tasks are whatever size you want them to be ... large, small, complex, easy. It is just a question of how much of which part of them you decide to work on ;-}"  and also "if you put in a task that is overwhelming, doing part of it is allowed, and encouraged and well within the rules".  I absolutely and completely agree!<br><br>I do think it is essential though to keep in mind the fact that you and I have both been doing AF for some weeks now.  In that time we have learned a lot about rephrasing, the way to word our tasks, whether (or when) to include large timeblock needing tasks or small individual tasks, how we include projects, and how to handle routine and recurring tasks - basically how AF works for us, within the rules, and with our own specific mix of tasks.<br><br>In the same way that you took time to work through the crossing off and readding of items, I took time to work through some of the other points.  I still (albeit after only 6 or so weeks) think it is beneficial to include routine and recurring tasks - i.e. those smaller items - into those lists. The mix of tasks compared to other type of tasks may vary from time to time but at the end of the day I can only say that, for me, having that mix of items seems to be beneficial.  It is for that reason that I offer that as advice in that it may help someone else who is perhaps struggling as I was.<br><br>I know Mark put it far more concisely amd elegantly than me when he said that he would not recommend adding whole lists of backlog items to start with but rather to grow the list organically, and also in his advices on including minor tasks, but hey you know me Mike, why say in one word what you can say in 743 - or was it 744? :-)</div>

<div class="content">For me, I try (with varying degrees of success) to put all tasks on the the list if they aren't scheduled events.  That serves many purposes.  <br><br>It makes me realize how much I have going on and how much of my time minor tasks are taking up.  Those minor ones are the ones that help me procrastinate.  Putting them on the list helps me cut back on them automatically.<br><br>Larger tasks or projects get worked on a little at a time and are added back to the list.  They are often reworded and sometimes details are added that help feed the next step.  Such as adding the phone number to the rewritten task to Call Joe once I have looked it up the first (or second) time I attacked it.  <br><br>In other words some tasks with multiple steps don't have all the steps added as separate tasks while others do.  I think both Mike and Christine are saying pretty much the same thing.  <br><br>We all have slightly different styles and that results in slightly different approaches while using the same basic guidelines.  Sometimes I even need to use some of the tweeks to help me through something knowing that I will drop them when they no longer are helpful.  Making those choices knowing that they are temporary sometimes reduces stress that has become a temporary hindrance to performance.  Personally, I see nothing wrong with that.  It is just part of my own common sense rule.<br><br>By the way, thanks for all the advice and discussion!</div>

I have loads of backlog stuff and that inevitably has an impact on AF and deadlines etc. I suspect all of us will use tweaks for that very reason and like you I feel that is all part of the common sense approach.  If someone drops in for coffee I "make coffee" - if the tax man demands a response by a deadline I usually take notice!  I am sure that next year the tax man will hardly even appear on the radar - I've already collated all of the info that is currently available so next year will be a breeze!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine,<br><br>743?  ROTF ;-)  If that is all you can muster you are not even in my league ;-)<br><br>As to adding all tasks at once, I agree with that.  In my own case, I scanned my "old" list and did some pruning and consolodating.  Some things I left off because they were in the way for now (someday/maybe).  In the end, I guess I had about 100 items or so to start with and then added as things came up.  As I said before it seems as if things will come up again on their own if they get lost ... and that is what has happened.<br><br>I really see that the temptation to add everything you can think of out of the gate is almost insurmountable ;-)  It does make sense to hold off and just put them in in small batches.  As you go, you'll probably find that things you did not copy over magically appeared on their own, and that's all to the good.<br><br>I have one problem page in my list right now.  It came about because when I set up the list I was thinking about the house renovations i want to do so it is dense with HUGE PROJECTS as items.  Really, I have no idea what possessed me.  I will either dismiss them (because they already live on my projects list) or just take one or two of them forward, maybe rewording and reorganizing.  But that page is a problem because it is like hitting a wall when I come to it.  OTOH, I doubt that the problem would be much changed if they were "sprinkled" around the list.  I'd then just have to dismiss them one at a time.  The psychological effect is because they are all in a bunch, but the real root problem is that they should not be there in the first place.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike<br><br>You're definitely right about how large items are "sprinkled" having different effects.  When I am adding backlog items I take them exactly as written in my previous system in batches of about 10 at a time.  The first action on them is frequestly to rewrite them but having them in clumps does have it's own resistance factor.  Once you address one the rest seem to move a bit - it's as if they remain stuck together and have their own corporate identity.<br><br>With my projects, I am actually actioning many of them by taking them out of AF into my Project Management system, redefining them there, and then putting them back into the list in whatever format seems appropriate.  For example, I employ carers for my mother.  There were a number of tasks involved, including Contracts of Employment, Payroll issues, administration, liaising with Social Services etc etc.  All were tasks in my list. I then extracted those tasks (not artificially but as they stood out) to a Project within my Project management system, which is where I am defining any necessary procedures, and keep all relevent information, paperwork, etc so that the overall group of actions is as streamlined, co-ordinated and organised as possible.  The individual tasks get added to my list as necessary and actioned as appropriate.  I am finding that the reorganising of such projects (in time allocated by AF) enables me to feel in control of those projects from an organisational perspective, and the management of the tasks arising within AF enables me to feel in control of the "doing". <br></div>

<div class="content">Christine,<br><br>The situation with your mother is what I would consider a "largish" project ... not something like buying a car which we have all done before and know the steps and for which there is usually little downside if things get a little messed up.  In your situation, it is complex, complicated, involves timing and communication ... all hallmarks of a large project.<br><br>Those hit my TODO list (none has hit AF yet, I'm too new with it) and then go right into project planning where I lay it all out, with dependencies and resources, etc.  Then the individual items would go back on my AF list, early ones first (because later ones may change anyway).<br><br>I'm NOT a big fan of the GtD approach of not planning beyond the first action ... that is insane for this kind of thing.  OTOH, I don't want to put everything on the list at first because AF does not respect dependencies.  So I'd just put the independent items on the list then trust that I'll know when to go back and update the project and add the next items to my list.<br><br>As to backlog items, they are also in my "project" planning system ... just as a list.  Most of them are in fact projects, or they probably would have gotten done.  But I do remember that I'm about a year behind in returning a phone call to a friend and that will get moved to the AF list in its time.  My feeling about what goes on the list is everything unless I determine that it will not realistically get done soon then I move it off onto my "someday" list to await its time.<br><br>One example of the kind of clutter I don't allow on my list is "Buy Xmas Present for X".  I don't need the gift in my hands for another nine months or so .. why should I read it every day, and periodically move it to the end of the list?  Senseless.  I have a list of people I buy presents for with some ideas (if I have those ideas now) and when I start hearing "Jingle Bells" on the radio, I'll go tweak that list and put the items into AF to get done.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike<br><br>I have to confess to being a little surprised when you mention that you still have a separate To Do list of project type items that have not yet found their way into AF.  I set up a system years ago to manage projects which enables everything to be defined as to whether it is a routine task, a one off item or part of a larger project and then has a structure to enable management.  When I started with AF I did just "throw everything" at it, regardless of which "category" it would have fallen in and the system has proved itself time and time again in the way that IT identifies the splits and deals with each item appropriately.  I didn't add all of my backlog items, as I felt that would overload the system at too early a stage (but have a task to drip feed those items in periodically).  I have about 100 items still to add and I am looking forward to having them all in one place! (Even if I am not looking forward to doing them!)<br><br>My projects I added in their entirety, but generally just as a one word overview.  That has led to them naturally moving into my Project management system for organisation and action.  By having items of the type that it sounds like you have retained on your To Do list, the system in many cases enabled me to identify better ways of doing things, and certainly better times of doing many of them.<br><br>For example, household tasks:- initially they stood out first and I learned that they had more of an impact on my work time than I realised.  They then dropped out of focus and created a mess.  I tried to action them outside of the system but it "felt wrong".  Eventually, what became apparent was they were standing out at "the right time" which was evenings and weekends.  Ironically I had always envied my friends who just did the household chores quite naturally at those times.  For me I had always resented doing them at those times although I had wanted to.  Doing them during "working hours" was definite procrastination but was probably also something of an act of rebellion! <br><br>Christmas is actually something I already had set up as a project.  With OneNote I can keep all of my Christmas Files in one place.  I have a spreadsheet for food items, a database with a range of Christmas tags to enable extraction for card and present lists, mail merge instructions for that database (as I only use that method once a year), Christmas ClipArt for labels, a video list for having friends over for a video and mulled wine evening, and so on and so on.  All I need in AF is a task to "review projects" on a periodic basis and I can just add "Start Christmas project" into my schedule for some suitable date in November.</div>

<div class="content">Christine,<br><br>There seems to be some kind of misunderstanding.  I had my home improvement projects in my project planning software.  What happened is that when I set up the AF list, I somehow got to thinking about those things and put them in the AF list then noticed that they really should not have been put there as they are already in my project planning area.  So I "moved them back" as in "deleted them from AF because they don't belong there and are already in my planning area."  (Or will, I've not yet deleted them.)  An example, perhaps:<br><br>I need to add insulation to the attic.  So long as I'm up there I'll want to replace the recessed ceiling lights in the hall way as well as put in a ceiling fan in the Master Bedroom.  I have that (and a few other connected items) in a "project" called "attic".<br><br>When making the AF list I was thinking that it is getting close to time to work in the attic (after the real cold and before the really really hot!  So I put "Do attic work" on the AF list.  Now it was already in the project list ... it is just that it came to mind as I was making the first AF list.  As to what will go on the AF list WHEN the time comes (in about a month to six weeks) it may be something as large as "Work on attic", or something like "Insulate attic" or maybe even smaller like "Buy attic insulation" or even smaller "Research attic insulation".  It all depends.<br><br>My point is that it won't go on to the AF list because it SHOULD NOT be there now.  I have it covered because it is in my projects files.  I don't need to see it until I'm ready to work on it.  I won't be ready until late March or early April.  So reviewing it several times a day until then is just wasting time.<br><br>Worse, it would become dismissed well before the time came to do it.  Then I'd have to go through the exercise of adding it back when I was ready ... which is where I am now ... I waiting until I'm ready to add it.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike<br><br>Yes I had misunderstood you, when you said "none has hit AF yet, I'm too new with it" I took that to mean that you were not yet comfortable with putting them into the system.  It sounds like you and I are approaching projects in the same way.  I suspect that we both spend a fair bit of time on our project planning and those projects will naturally gravitate into the lists at the right time (even if a nudge is needed with a "review projects" task occasionally).  As I am still refining a lot of my projects I haven't yet needed to create a nudge system, but I think that will happen if and when necessary without too much fuss or fanfare.<br><br>Of course you could always have a task "am I ready?" :-)</div>

<div class="content">Christine,<br><br>Yes, I spend a lot of time reviewing and planning.  But the good thing about AF is that it is bottom up as well as top down from the project's list.  So the planning brings the higher level things to action and the AF list, as well as executing, brings the low level things back up to be reviewed and added to the planning.  Very nice.<br><br>As to a nudge to review, I don't need it, myself.  As with so many other things, I've habituated it.  It happens every Sunday morning ... usually while drinking coffee over at my neighbor's house.<br><br>Habit is everything ;-)</div>

<div class="content">I think you've mentioned before about your weekly planning session - sounds a great idea.  I always feel more motivated when I am planning with someone else, regardless of whether we are working on the same things or not.  One of the features of being a Myers Briggs E I guess :-)</div>

<div class="content">Mike - <br><br>What is this separate Project Planning software/list that you speak of?  So you have a list of specific steps/ideas about projects in a different place?<br><br>I'm interested in this.</div>

<div class="content">Sqril: "For instance "read something you own" is on page one. So I'm now reading a book that I own but the task isn't done. "<br><br>ok, it is not done...but you can cross it out and write it down again on the last page...after reading for a little while or whatever time you fell like  :)<br><br>From the instructions: "4.Cross the item off the list, and re-enter it at the end of the list if you haven’t finished it"<br><br>I guess that's your problem - you don't have to finish task to cross it out from a page :)</div>

<div class="content">This has been a problem for me too - I've only been using AF for a few weeks.  When I started filling up my notebook, I was basically doing a "brain dump" - many similar things rolled out at the same time - for example, as I was remembering one outdoor task, I would remember 10 other similar things and write them down immediately.<br><br>Now, a  few weeks into this, I'm writing down one thing at a time as I think of it, and the tasks are coming in a way that will be easier to deal with.<br><br>In the meantime, I'm scanning each page at least once a day.</div>

<div class="content">@Krewetka<br><br>I've decided (per posts above) that it's all in the wording for things like reading books.  I'm not going to go running to the list to see if I can continue reading my book or not - especially since I can't seem to get through my pages.  <br><br>For me - the problem is starting to read a book I own so if I put it on the list it would be "Start reading a book you own" and then that's that (when I start reading).  When I'm done with that book I can then go back to the list and add that item again.<br><br>Also - books was a specific problem - it's the big projects (that don't get finished in a few hours) that I was/am having problems with.  But I think I'm on my way now pending info about this separate Project software from Mike/Christine</div>

<div class="content">Hi Sqril<br><br>You are right regarding wording of tasks and that wording will inevitably vary from person to person.  Sometimes with a task like reading, just putting it on the list once will be enough to give it the kickstart it needs - sometimes it will need to be added again but the correct balance will become clear as you get used to the system.<br><br>As far as projects are concerned, they are a discussion area in themselves.  As Mark said in another post, a book on time management will be very different to a book on project management, and he differentiated between managing the project and managing yourself in the project.  AF handles the latter; for the former you need some form of project management system which, at least for larger projects, would be outside of AF.<br><br>As a general rule, I define a project as anything out of the normal routine that consists of more than a few odd tasks.  As a result it will normally come accompanied by "baggage" in the form of files (digital or paper), other paperwork, research, contacts, physical items etc etc.  Consequently those "things" need some sort of system to control them, whether that be a computer folder, a filing cabinet, a box or any combination of the above.  I personally manage my projects within Microsoft OneNote as that looks like a notebook (or more like a Filofax style organizer) but can include all manner of digital files as well as text, and I also use it to reference and keep track of any physical elements of a project.  The structure of any of my projects is actually quite simple - a summary of the project, an index, the relevant files and/or links as appropriate and finally a list of tasks.  It is that task list that then impacts upon AF.<br><br>Some projects may require blocks of time, for example a research project (Family Tree) or a writing project (Book/Thesis etc).   Others may be better suited to ad hoc tasks or groups of tasks, for example planning a business trip, or producing a set of accounts.  With either type, I will have a task list within my project management system but will action that list within AF, either by means of a time block (actioned when it stands out) or by adding individual tasks into the system.<br><br>I hope that explains things more clearly.  As I said it is a subject in itself and one I could expand on at great length :-) , but hopefully that gives an indication as to how project management can be integrated quite easily into AF.</div>

<div class="content">Sqril,<br><br>Projects (to me) are either PROJECTS or projects ;-)  For PROJECTS, I use project management software (of the PERT/CPM variety).  For "projects", I just noodle out a list of plans any way possible.<br><br>So, for my project "Build a Deck", it is big but not of PROJECT size, therefore I noodle it out on paper and then put it into ... well, almost anything.  It could be MS Word, a text file, until they went belly up, I was using NoteStudio which is a type of Wiki.  I've used Mind Manager, various outliners, etc.<br><br>The point is not so much the software or technique as it is thinking through the steps and laying out a rough time line and dependency, if there is one.  So I might have a list (almost anywhere) like:<br><br>- Research deck plans<br>- Lay out size on lawn<br>- Measure size and figure supplies<br>- Price supplies<br>- Line up some help<br>- Rent truck<br>- Buy supplies <br>- Level ground<br>- Dig post holes<br>- Pour footings<br>- Lay out boards<br>-- Measure<br>-- Cut<br>-- Screw down<br>-- Lather, Rinse, Repeat ;-)<br>- Sand finished deck<br>- Seal Deck<br>- Set up Grill<br>- Buy Beer and Steaks<br>- Have helpers over for BBQ ;-)<br><br>One product I like is OneNote for Microsoft Windows.  It is an easy way to collect info, links and cuts from web sites, etc.<br><br>If you need more info, just ask ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike:<br>You said above:<br>"I have one problem page in my list right now. It came about because when I set up the list I was thinking about the house renovations i want to do so it is dense with HUGE PROJECTS as items. Really, I have no idea what possessed me. I will either dismiss them (because they already live on my projects list) or just take one or two of them forward, maybe rewording and reorganizing. But that page is a problem because it is like hitting a wall when I come to it. OTOH, I doubt that the problem would be much changed if they were "sprinkled" around the list. I'd then just have to dismiss them one at a time. The psychological effect is because they are all in a bunch, but the real root problem is that they should not be there in the first place. "<br><br>I have the same issue.  My first two pages had the following items:<br>- re-do kitchen counters<br>- stipple off my bathroom ceiling<br>- organize storage room<br>- stipple off library ceiling<br>- stipple off kitchen ceiling<br>- stipple off halls<br>- stipple off LR/DR <br>- baseboards off in spare room<br><br>Can you tell I hate popcorn ceilings?  :-)  They've all been dismissed now, apart from the library ceiling which has been done and those 2 pages are complete.  AF helped me realize about 3 weeks ago that I wanted to focus on one area and one project to the finish.  I had some other of these big projects sprinkled around my list in various areas of the house and I went through and dismissed them ahead of time.  The common sense thing to do would be to do all of the ceilings first and get the co. in to retexture them all at once.  But there's no reason it can't be done room by room or in a couple of months when the popcorn is all removed.  That's what furniture covers and sheet plastic are for.  I've given my oldest son the job of removing the popcorn because I was totally resisting it.  He actually likes doing it .  :-)<br><br>I think a lot of us have a tendency to really like planning more than doing, or at least I do.  Before, I'd probably spend more time planning these big projects than I would actually doing something on them.  Now there's nothing to plan but the current room, and I planned that out when I put the next action type of items on my AF list, so I'm forced (in the nicest way possible) to do things.<br><br>I don't keep project lists separately, not because I don't think they're valuable because I do - for some people.  I would be too tempted to spend tons of time planning and re-planning the projects though, especially if it was outside of the AF system.   Before starting an area/room, I sometimes do develop a step-oriented list/plan on the left side of the page of my AF notebook which I keep blank.  I don't seem to refer to them though, I just pick the next action of what needs to be done in that room.<br><br>I wish I could keep plans though, it's a tremendous amount of fun.<br></div>

<div class="content">Personally, as someone who has always had trouble finishing books, I do put "Read such-and-such-a-book" on the list. I have about five on the go. This has helped me to keep progressing through them - some faster than others - but all still moving.</div>

<div class="content">With books, I put "read chapter 2 of xxx" for example on my list, or "read sections 1.1 through 1.3." That way I get to make progress and cross things out! It's very satisfying.</div>
