<div class="content">We were talking about this a while back and since David thinks the forum is too quiet, and I'm eating lunch, here goes...<br><br>I've been noting how often I draw The Line and how many items get put up for review when I do.  As it turns out, I've been drawing the line just about once a week - my minimum (since I started keeping track on 9/28) has been 5 days and my maximum 11, though the max is misleading (I was on a business trip and so was working from a separate "on a trip" list - first time I'd done that and it was FANTASTIC, by the way).  <br><br>I have been dismissing somewhere between 3 and 5 items; only once in the last ~6 weeks have I finished a closed list without review.  A couple of times I have noted when I went back and did the review, and it points to how crazy life has been - there have been lags of 4-5 days.  I really have been chasing the end of the open list a lot lately.<br><br>Currently I've got a pretty small list - only 4 pages, with 11 open items above the line and 13 below.  I've been doing better at getting through both the open and closed lists since I caught up on all the grading that piled up while I was away last month.<br><br>Has anybody else been noting this stuff?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Sarah,<br><br>I got on a kick a few months back and tried to keep numbers (before AF4).  I realized that what I wanted to know reaquired some calculation so I got into Excel and macros.  Then I realized that I was in the weeds and stopped the nonsense and went back to work.  LOL ;-)<br><br>Just out of habit, I draw a small line each day so I can get a general idea of number of tasks added per day.  I also put the date on each task I close (one way or another).  But I have not felt moved to do anything about that information.</div>

<div class="content">I completely understand.  It might be possible that I have a touch of the Fun Brand of OCD.  :^)  I used to keep much more detailed info - dates that pages were opened, closed, put up for review, reviewed, etc.  Also dates I did things.  But, like you, I never DID anything with any of them.  These ones are very quick notations and I still don't do anything with them until the topic comes up here!</div>
