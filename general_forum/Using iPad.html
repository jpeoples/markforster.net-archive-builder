<div class="content">I got an iPad on the day they came out. I also bought an app called IYH (In Your Handwriting). It was 99 cents.<br><br>www.geewhizstuff.com <br>It looks better in actuality than the screenshots they show. There is a free version of the app as well so you can try it out. <br><br>I have it set up with my SF3 Alternative (except I don't have a blank line underneath since IYH can have pages attached to any line).<br><br>There are 18 lines to a page. Each line can unlimited pages to the right of it.<br><br>Even though I don't use SF3, I'm certain it could easily be set up to run it. <br><br>My projects sit as a line item and in subpages to the "right" are all the tasks and subtasks. It makes it easy to work on projects without all the items cluttering up your list.<br><br>It's working incredibly with my SF3 Alternative. I'm blown away. <br><br>Check it out.<br><br>Matt</div>

<div class="content">I've been reviewing both "task management" tools and "handwriting" tools for iOS devices. UYH (the product you just recommended) does, indeed, look absolutely gorgeous in use. For handwriting apps, though, it seems the community favorite is Penultimate (<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/penultimate/id354098826?mt=8)." target="new" rel="nofollow">http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/penultimate/id354098826?mt=8).</a> Other notable ones are Inkiness (<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/inkiness/id318578222?mt=8)," target="new" rel="nofollow">http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/inkiness/id318578222?mt=8),</a> Note Taker HD (<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/note-taker-hd/id366572045?mt=8)," target="new" rel="nofollow">http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/note-taker-hd/id366572045?mt=8),</a> and Noteshelf (<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/noteshelf/id392188745?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4)." target="new" rel="nofollow">http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/noteshelf/id392188745?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4).</a> I have been looking at these in the context of taking notes and their integration with Evernote's OCR.<br><br>For task management, this forum is my main source of recommendations for apps to review. You've seen the same suggestions that I have and you have probably, like me, found that some can be made to work but none really "fit" for SF3.</div>

<div class="content">UYH could easily be made to fit SF3. The first line of any page would be "Column 2" and when you double-click it, it takes you to a page of 18 lines. The rest of the lines for the page would be for Column 1 tasks, and this double-clicked line would be Column 2.<br><br>I think it would work great.<br><br>Matt</div>

<div class="content">Just downloaded the app. It is great and it can work as an SAF notebook like you say.</div>
