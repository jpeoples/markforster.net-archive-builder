To do that he advises: “Be a good listener; encourage others to talk about themselves; talk in terms of the other person's interests; make them feel important - and do it sincerely.”<br><br>     He then adds, “When dealing with people, let us remember we are not dealing with creatures of logic. We are dealing with creatures of emotion, creatures bustling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity."</div>
