<div class="content">Dear Christine B - I've enjoyed reading your posts and found them extremely interesting and helpful.  I'm particularly interested in your use of OneNote and the way you have set it up.  But I'm curious about why you (appear to) duplicate your hardcopy AF list in OneNote.  I'm using The Journal (because our corporate IT people won't allow us to install OneNote and The Journal runs on a USB stick) and have tried something similar to what I think you are doing with OneNote, but I'm finding that I often do not have the two lists synced.  My apologies if you've covered this elsewhere.<br><br>Regards ... Colin</div>

<div class="content">Hi Colin<br><br>I'm glad my posts have been of help to you :-)  You are right in that I do duplicate my lists in OneNote.  This happened really by accident to start with.  Like many people on the forum my initial thought was that I wanted to use AF in a digital format and my initial approach with OneNote was an attempt to do so.  However I soon found that Mark is absolutely correct in recommending the paper approach and I most definitely consider my paper notebook "my system".  However the digital approach does have advantages over paper and that is why I have kept it going.  Once set up, it takes me minutes to maintain, so the duplication is not onerous.  It literally takes 2 to 3 minutes to enter a page - generally I do not enter a page until it is complete.<br><br>Firstly, unlike my paper notebook where I tick off items, I tag items as completed in OneNote.  Visually that tag merely highlights the item in yellow.  One of the reasons I like to keep statistics, is that, a long time ago, I identified that one of my primary motivators was "seeing" progress. When I move onto the next page in my notebook, I really enjoy going to OneNote and marking off the completed tasks.  It looks great to see all of those highlighted items!  Also, it is very easy to review my outstanding tasks - as they are the ones not highlighted.  I can very quickly page through and keep an overview of what is still outstanding - and be motivated to move on to those pages where I can see they are likely to be closed on the next cycle!<br><br>Also, I don't use tags within my paper notebook as it distracts when scanning.  OneNote gives me the ability to tag items and extract those as a specific list.  That is particularly useful if I need to identify items for a specific project, for email follow up, for discussion with another party, etc etc.  I also have a tag for Dismissed tasks, which highlights the task in green.  It takes seconds to extract a list of Dismissed Items for my "review Dismissed Items" task.<br><br>Finally, my OneNote notebook does not contain just my pages.  It is also the base for my project management and the store for notes and reference material, much of which has been generated through the forum.  If someone posts regarding an article of interest, I try not to let myself get diverted but just open the link in a new tab.  Periodically (I have a task to check open IE pages!) I review those articles, recommendations, or whatever, and if I want to retain a copy just print it straight into OneNote.  So for example, if I want to look back at the sites with recommendations for improving handwriting, I can go to them instantly in my AutoFocus notebook, complete with links to the relevant website in case I want to research further.<br><br>Because I am a very visual person there is something immensely satisfying about the neatness and visible progress I can see within OneNote.  Because it so closely mirrors my paper notebook it is simple - page by page by page.  Also, although I have not yet set this up, there is the potential to make the notebook available online so that I could access it from anywhere.<br><br>To answer your last point about keeping the lists synced, I don't find this to be a problem.  I aim to enter each page from my notebook when I reach the end of a page, and I update completed tasks each time I move on from a page. By having that almost as a habit, maintenance is no bother.  Very occasionally, if for example I am entering a lot of tasks, I have gotten a few pages behind in entering tasks but that doesn't happen very often and generally doesn't take long to enter.  It's just boring entering more than one page at a time - but little and often deals with that :-)<br><br>Hope that helps .....    <br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine - thanks for your comprehensive answer.  I like the sound of your system and would like to implement something similar.  I'll read your other OneNote posts which I think will also be very helpful.  All the best ... Colin</div>
