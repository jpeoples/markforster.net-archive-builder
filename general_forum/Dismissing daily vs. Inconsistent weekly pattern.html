<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-07-1 23:58</div>
<div class="content">First up: As with so many others, I'm hugely grateful for AF2. Thank you.<br><br>AF2 is already proving significantly more effective for me than AF1, and this is predominately due to its improved ability to manage urgent tasks.<br><br>One of my early niggles is with dismissing uncompleted tasks which are 'on notice' from the previous day. <br><br>The nature of my work (psychiatric assessment and treatment) is hard to predict and doesn't conform to five similar "shaped" days. In practice, this means I can have 4-5 hours of admin time on Monday (and put several unactioned items on notice at the end of that day), but on Tuesday I might only have 30 minutes of admin time at best. If it turned out that I had another 4-5 hours on the Tuesday, then I would more than likely have completed the items on notice, but seeing as I only had 30 minutes, I've had to dismiss them.<br><br>Although each day is hard to predict, most weeks end up with a more predictable allocation of admin and clinical time.<br><br>My temptation is to keep drawing a line for each day, but only dismiss items on notice on a weekly basis (ie. anything unactioned items under the last five lines), rather than on a daily basis.<br><br>Any thoughts? Is this a slippery slope which will only end in tears? Anyone else have similar concerns?<br><br>And my apologies if this has been discussed in a previous post - I don't have the time to read every single post. If necessary, I'm happy to be pointed to another post by way of an answer.</div>

<div class="content">I agree that increasing the dismissal time could be helpful.  In DIT Mark drew a line and actionned the tasks the next day,  but that is maybe not for everyone.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for this topic, Neumatist. It certainly has been discussed elsewhere, but on this forum it is fine to ask a question afresh.<br><br>Once your lists mature, your "at risk" items may well be at least a week old, so on a weekly average cycle, you might be OK with the standard rules. If you find you are beginning to dismiss tasks that need to be done, you can always review your dismissed items and reinstate them.  But you would need to be careful that the dismissal doesnt become meaningless. <br><br>At the moment, I am having a similar issue with weekend jobs. I just shared my list with She, who is unimpressed that strimming the allotment is getting dismissed today. Perhaps weekend jobs (or any jobs on a different timescale?) really do need a separate list?<br><br>Mark, any advice?</div>

<div class="content">Another thinkable variation of increasing the dismissal time could be that you draw your line weekly instead of daily. What I mean is, that at the beginning of each week you go to your oldest active page, and draw a line to mark the tasks that are  “on notice” for dismissal. At the beginning of the following week, all "on notice" items that have not been actioned are dismissed. Then re-draw the line as before.<br><br>Okay, admitted, it's just another one of my crazy ideas, and probably goes against the purpose of Autofocus, but maybe someone is willing to test it.<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi,<br><br>I'm going through the same situation. I started using AF2 since Sunday, and the results are surprising. I found myself opening the list late at night, something that didn't happen... in months? Wow. I also want to say thanks to Mark.<br><br>I'm finding that I can't keep the pace. Things are dismissed extremely quickly. I started a new list, so my oldest tasks are actually new. A lot of them (most of them) are dismissed already. Does it make sense to dismiss them only to reenter them on the next, or even on the same day?<br><br>Maybe the fact that the dismissing action is so much faster means that the reentering of the tasks should be faster as well?<br><br>Walter<br></div>

<div class="content">Rainer,<br><br>A "weekly review" type of idea sounds good but I can see the stumbling block being that you would have no system-enforced incentive to visit the earliest tasks on your list - assuming you knew they were not urgent - until dismissal time is coming up.</div>

<div class="content">My take on this is that if I'm about to enter a task whick I KNOW I won't have a chance to get to in the next few days, I ad it instead to my calendar as a reminder. (I'm using Google calendar and have started using Google tasks as these forward reminders). They are displayed differently from appointments and also can be ticked off when done.<br><br>Then at the start of each day, when I check my calendar for appointments, I add any tasks to the end of my AF list. Seems to work for me (as long as I remember to check my calendar :-)</div>

<div class="content">Maybe worth drawing the line after a _fixed_ number of 'working' days, where 'working' means working normally from the list.<br><br>Each day I write a day divider eg <br><br>Thursday 2/7 ------------------------. <br><br>If it's an 'AF2 non working' day I just bracket the date for reference eg<br><br>(Thursday 2/7) ------------------------. <br><br>This makes it easy to count back the number of 'working days'. <br><br>Doing it this way makes it easy to handle weekend specific items, days off, holidays etc.</div>

<div class="content">Hi all,<br><br>I've had the similar issues where I've had a couple of 'non-discretionary' days and didn't feel happy with automatic dismissal each day.<br><br>I'm experimenting with adding the task "Dismiss tasks and draw a new line" to my list to see if it stands out often enough to dictate when I dismiss tasks.<br><br>Matt</div>

<div class="meta">2009-07-2 20:20</div>
<div class="content">Useful discussion - this is also an issue for me and I'd already decided to set my own 'on notice for dismissal' interval depending on how much discretionary time I knew I was going to have.  For my work list this week I've had several hours a day on the list, and a new shorter list, so I have stuck with the 'dismissal after a day' rule and it has worked well (ie I did the items - nothing dismissed).  For the home list, I've given myself a week for the 'on notice' task as I have little free time till after this weekend and the urgent stuff will really have to take priority.  I guess there's a danger that I'll make up an approach which invalidates the whole benefit of the dismissal rule, but I can't seem to believe in a rule which would have such an arbitrary effect, nor in workarounds such as moving the item to a calendar or 'dismissed items' list just to legitimise putting it back onto the main list in a few days!<br><br>Overall though, I'm finding AF2 so much more comfortable to work with, confident to put items on the list as I know I'll see them again soon, and scanning the whole list for items to work on, with an incentive to  clear the older items, is such an intuitive approach.  Brilliant!</div>

<div class="content">I'm also really enjoying AF2 (and only came in at AF1).  AF2 certainly works far better - I'm really enjoying it and getting things done which have been on my To Do list - whether actually or mentally - for months or even years.  Like others, I have been faced with dismissing 'live' items - today I will have to dismiss a work item which didn't get done over the weekend because I don't usually work at the weekend. (In AF1 I had home and work lists but I've combined them for AF2 and generally this works much better.) However, I've found that AF2 has usefully changed my attitude to dismissal, which I had real problems with in AF1.  Dismissed items are not lost - on the contrary they are highlighted.  When you read through your whole list every morning, if something dismissed stands out as still important to do, you can just add it at the end.  And/or you can add the item 'Review dismissed items' to your list. That gives you the chance, as Mark has said, to rethink it, break it down or whatever, if necessary.  So I'm sticking with the letter of the rules and it's working well.</div>

<div class="content">@Neumatist - regarding your original question, I think the issue of irregular discretionery time is something a little different from recurring (e.g. weekly) tasks getting dismissed before having the chance to act on them - and I've been thinking about using the following approach if/when I encounter it:<br><br>On any day, the first time you open the list in order to take action (i.e. not simply to jot down something new) you should do the standard "start of day" routine:<br>1. dismiss unactioned "on notice" items<br>2. mark next "on notice" block<br>3. read through the list<br><br>...but with the following slight modification...<br><br>In 1: If on the previous day that you worked on the list (i.e. excluding any where you didn't work on the list *at all*) you had too little discretionary time, don't dismiss any tasks.<br>In 2: *Always* mark as "on notice" the oldest contiguous block of items that are unactioned, non-dismissed and not-on-notice, regardless of the prior day's discretionary time - i.e. in the case in (1) where you've not dismissed tasks you'll still be *adding* another on notice block to the existing on notice tasks.<br><br>In an earlier thread Mark F suggested (if I understood correctly) that a day in which you don't do anything at all with an AF2 list should (or at least could) be simply ignored when it came to applying the dismissal rules - so a week's vacation on a tropical paradise wouldn't mean dismissing the next seven unactioned blocks on your return! This is an extension to that idea to "partially ignore" days where, for example, you only had a few 5-10 minute gaps between meetings.<br><br>The set of on-notice tasks progresses to reach exactly the same tasks as under the standard rules, but a temporary stay of execution can be granted on actual dismissal. It works restrospectively so you never have to decide/guess at the start of the day whether or not this is a day with "sufficient" or "too little" time to be counted.<br><br>Obviously the definition of "too little" as the threshold for time available to work on the list the previous day is key - and will almost certainly differ per individual. The intention is that the potential to "game the system" with this method would be counteracted by the fact that even when you opt to not dismiss, you are still increasing the number of tasks "on notice" that'll be dismissed (unless done in the meantime) the day after the next day with "sufficient" time.<br><br>If you invoke the "get out clause" a number of days in a row you will end up with a lot more tasks on notice, which should act as a warning sign. If after several "too little time" days you get a decent day's work then all tasks in the multiple on-notice blocks must be actioned or else get dismissed the following day, and the list "resets" to normal. This is a little bit like the DIT idea of incoming and completed workloads having to be balanced over a short-to-medium-term timeframe.<br><br>If every day for a longer period has too little time then that's a clear sign that:<br>1. you're over-committed - either non-discretionary time must be reduced or many things on the AF2 list will never be actioned (in which case your "too little time" threshold ought to be adjusted to properly reflect your environment, meaning that much more will be dismissed), or<br>2. you're lying to yourself about having "too little" time as a means of procrastinating on doing/dismissing one or more on-notice tasks - this is a rule breakage just like simply not dismissing something, but if you're still adding new on-notice blocks there should be an enhanced level of self-correction unles you fall completely off the AF2 wagon!<br><br>If anyone who has the kind of irregular time pattern of concern (I don't at the moment) tries this out I'd be interested in how it goes - does it weaken/change the normal psychological impact of totally standard AF2 dismissal?<br><br>It'd also be interesting to hear how those who use absoutely pure AF2 get on with any "too little time" days as their list matures, perhaps it's just an artefact created by a fairly freshly-started AF2 list?<br><br>Bit of a long post, but hope it's at least a little helpful or thought-provoking...<br>SteveB<br></div>

<div class="content">Some days I have little or no discretionery time and as I am using AF2 with my old AF lists do find it difficult to work back through all of my many pages.  On a day where I have almost complete discretionery time I stick to the rules and work back but on days where I will only have maybe a few half hour blocks then I have actioned any on notice tasks that I am not willing to dismiss.  I don't want to get to a "comfort zone" of dismissing and readding which I could think could be a danger otherwise.  I find then that I can allow items to stand out for any further time I may get during the day without pressure and without forcing myself back to the beginning of the list artificially.</div>

<div class="content">My advice is to stick to the rules as written. The problem of items being put on notice after only a couple of days on the list soon goes away as your list gets longer. The problem of not having enough discretionary time to get back to the beginning of the list on some days is an encouragement to go back to the beginning of the list on those days when you *do* have time.</div>
<h2>Reply by SteveB</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-07-8 14:21</div>
<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>I generally agree with your first point - at least for most people I'd expect a "mature" AF2 list to cover a reasonable, and probably relatively stable, period between the oldest (i.e. on notice) and newest tasks. I'm not there yet but early signs suggest mine's heading towards about a week and half's "spread".<br><br>I see the reasoning of your second point - it should be a good motivator (in fact my idea aimed to increase this motivation by extending the on-notice block, which also avoids slowing down the overall dismissal progress despite delaying "odd-ball" dismissals) - but I'm not sure it necessarily resolves the issue, or at least the perception of an issue. Let's take an (hypothetical) example...<br><br>One Wednesday I have an extremely low amount of discretionery time, say 5-15 mins (but not zero, so I can't say it was totally a "non-list" day). This doesn't give enough time to act on all the on-notice items, so one or more are dismissed on Thursday morning.<br><br>Now suppose that - knowing I had such a day coming up (best case secnario) - I was extra-motivated as you suggest to tackle items near the beginning of the list on Mon/Tue. In doing so I took action on the item(s) that would have been dismissed on Thu - great! Except that I would still have marked a (different) block of unactioned items as being on-notice on Wed, and one or more of those items would still be dismissed on Thu due to the lack of time - the net effect is simply that different & slightly newer item(s) have been dismissed in place of slightly older ones. The perceived issue of such abberant days causing dismissal of items that (people feel) "shouldn't" be dismissed doesn't go away.<br><br>Now it's perfactly fair enough to say "that's the way it supposed to work", after all those slightly newer items still hadn't been actioned for a period, and could be brought back from the backburner of dismissal later if necessary... so perhaps it's only a preceived, and not real, issue? In which case those of us who encounter (or fear encountering) this scenario need to find a 'mental model' that resolves what currently feels like an abberation in the behaviour of the key on-notice psychological factor within AF2 - ideas welcome!<br><br>It sounds like you normally have a reasonable amount of daily discretionery time - do you have the occasional abberation of a day with very little, and if so how do you find its effect in terms of dismissal?<br><br>As ever, thanks for not just giving us these excellent systems (for free!), but for the deeper explanations you continue to provide about the reasoning behind the different mechanisms.<br></div>

<div class="content">I have a list for work and one for home. Because i have long work days, i can work on my home list only on weekends. My solution is simple (and i think is identical to SteveB's):<br><br>On a day i have time working on a particular list (home for example) i draw the line. The next day i have time working on the list, I dismiss the marked entries. So, on sunday i draw a line, but the dismissal takes place on next saturday, not on monday. And working 10 minutes on my home list on tuesday does not count ;-)<br><br>Same rule applies for my list for my job.<br><br>With this simple change i can handle the irregularities of my job (Monday i have discretionery time so i dismiss marked entries and draw a new line. The next three days i have no discretionery time, so nothing hapens to the list. On Friday there is time for dismissal, line drawing and working on items on my list).<br><br>Steffen<br></div>

<div class="content">Steffen - indeed the same in terms of simply "ignoring" days in which you don't get to the/a list at all. I'm pretty sure I sure a post from Mark along those lines before as well (I remember thinking "yeah, that's fairly obvious"!) - although I can't say whether he had in mind that it'd be a regular feature more than an occasional circumstance.<br><br>The slight difference in what I was thinking about was that in your example of having just a little time (10 mins) on the Tuesday I was suggesting that you'd still do the on-notice line drawing and dismissing from the previous day (in your example that'd be tasks that were put on notice first thing on Sun but weren't actioned) as the standard "first time I open the list on a day" routine.<br><br>However, on the next day you opened the list (Sat in the example) you wouldn't dismiss the on-notice tasks because you only had 10 mins on the "previous" day - but you would still mark the next unactioned block of tasks as on-notice. You then have 2 blocks of on-notice tasks that'll be dismissed the following day if not actioned.<br><br>The idea is that it should increase the motivation to get back to start of the list now that you do have the time - similar to Mark's point above, although retrospectively, not beforehand. It also maintains the speed at which the on-notice/dismissal threshold "marches forward" through the list at the same rate as if following the rules fully - it just gives a day's grace for on-notice tasks that'd otherwise be "caught out" but the irregularity in discretionery time. This should also help to counteract a potential urge to stretch the period of time you allow yourself to work on the list while still "not counting" the day, since you'd still be expanding the set of on-notice tasks regardless.<br><br>For a pure weekend/weekday split I'm not sure there's much difference, but if you do fairly regularly get the "odd 10-30 mins, only" in between it'd be interesting to hear how you get on (with or without my variation). Good luck, in any case...<br></div>

<div class="content">Hello SteveB,<br><br><br>thank you for the clarification. Now i understand the difference.<br><br>I haven't had time to try your "mark but not dismiss" strategie for those "10min days", but i will give it a try next week (it is on my list ;-))<br><br>My main concern with your strategie is, that a lot more items on my list will get marked for dismissal than i am able to work on on those "10min days".  But maybe that is no problem at all. I will see and report back, when i had enough time to test it.<br><br>Steffen<br></div>

<div class="meta">2009-07-10 12:19</div>
<div class="content">SteveB:<br><br>I think if I had a day in which I literally had only 5-15 minutes discretionary time I would regard that as a non-list day because when "discretionary time" is that short it's not really discretionary time at all. What I mean by that is that generally speaking there are certain things which you *have* to do if that's all the time you have.<br><br>As far as "non-list" days go, I think it's important to identify them in advance, e.g. "Tomorrow I'm going to the Conference, so it's a non-list day", rather than during the day "I'm far too busy to look at the list today, so let's call it a non-list day", or after the event "I didn't have time to look at the list today, so let's call it a non-list day". There's a certain degree of self-deception in the last two!</div>

<div class="content">That's a very good point Mark.  My days tend to be somewhat predictable in that Monday and Thursday are pretty much discretionery, Tuesdays and Wednesdays are about 40% and then there's Frantic Friday.  It's the Tuesdays and Wednesdays that generally throw me - I count them as AF days (so dismiss) but cannot always guarantee that there will be more than say an hour.  However, so far my doing or dismissing has been remarkably stress free :-)</div>

<div class="meta">2009-07-11 18:12</div>
<div class="content">Mark - excellent points, especially about such extremely short "discretionary" time in reality being pretty much mandatory. That 5-15 mins was in part reductio ad absurdum, though, to highlight the thinking; the potential concern is "what's the cut-off?". What if you have 20-30 mins, or 40-50, or...? That ability for self-deception or rationalisation you mentioned comes into play again.<br><br>I think (for at least some people, including me) it could be helpful to artificially turn that slippery slope back into a fixed cliff-edge. It may not stop me "cheating", but at least it forces me to acknowledge it and change the rationalisation from "I'm not cheating because..." to "I *am* cheating, but that's because...".<br><br>Except with very specific time/work patterns there may not be much real difference, but in thinking about such circumstances it seemed to be a possible way to decrease the "slippery slope" risk (which I know I'm prone to), while retaining/enhancing the motivational factor of "on notice for dismissal".<br><br>Regarding identifying non-list days in advance - I totally agree in principle, but in practice it can't always be done. You may think you've got 2-3 hours time around various meetings/etc, but then a problem identified in the first meeting requires a follow-up scheduled later in the day, that person in another department you've been chasing for weeks turns up at your desk to respond to your request (and despite it not being the best time for an hour's discussion, since you otherwise may have to wait a couple more weeks ... ), and then your last meeting over-runs by 45 mins... result: you get maybe 20-30 mins discretionary time.<br><br>The converse is also possible - e.g. the last sesion of a course gets cancelled - but it's trivial to then simply change your forecast "non-list" decision.<br><br>Interesting to think about, anyway - and great to get your thoughts since there may be non-obvious psychological factors designed in that could get destroyed, or potential side-effects you encountered in your extensive testing.<br></div>

<div class="content">I am wondering how much of the tension or pull of the items depends on the type of items on notice.  I suspect that may make quite a difference as for me, with my mature AF1 list, the items are pretty consistent in that they (a) have been there far too long! (b) are totally non-urgent in that the world clearly won't stop if they are not actioned but (c) have a relative importance, in that the doing of them will have a positive result.  The great thing about AF is that it forces you to look at the reasons for procrastination - with AF1, by allowing my lists to get so long (and therefore only needing to do one item on a page) those items could legitimnately languish and I didn't need to face them.  With AF2 that option is just not there.<br><br>I think that, once my on notice items become more current, then the process may well change it's feel.</div>

<div class="content">Hello Walter,<br><br><br>I can only second your statement, that dismissing is liberating. I just love the way AF (new terminology ;-)) helps you with this.<br><br>I have never tried one combined list. I am afraid, that my tasks for home will get burried between my tasks for the job (easily factor 1 to 20). And i do not want to see my tasks for my job on weekends. Too easy to start working on them and not concentrating on my family. But i am sure, that with a combined list, the daily dismissal would work.<br><br>With two lists, things are a bit different. With daily dismissal i would have dismissed all open tasks on my home list when the weekend begins. Either i would have to revive them all, or i would have nothing to do (nice, but nothing would get done either).<br></div>
