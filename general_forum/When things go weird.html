<div class="content">I was going to put this in another thread about using SFv3 in the IT world but I think it may deserve it's own thread.<br><br>I believe that there is a good SFv3 habit we can all benefit from. It's the condition of when things go weird.... How do you react to it.<br><br>What I mean by this is:<br><br>You have a Task you start to work on it because it calls to you.  When you get started on it you believe that to get it done you will:<br><br>"Do X, Y and then Z and then you are done."  <br><br>However, when you start to work on it you discover that "Y" isn't working.  When that happen it's in our nature for some of us to dig in and work heads down to try and fix "Y" or figure out how to work around the impasse to "Y"<br><br>Instead it may be better to realize that the task has just gone WEIRD. Stop working on it; cross it off and re-enter in in Column 2 of the next page as "figure out why Y isn't working" and them go back to the current page.<br><br>Basically the task has changed and it's duration has just changed. When you picked it up you had an internal commitment and expectation of what you are about to do; but that's just changed; you have done what you could and now it bares reconsideration it may not be the right thing to do just then based on time available and brain power available.</div>

<div class="content">The task was "wash dishes".  Then you turn on the faucet and the handle breaks.  You rush to turn off the valve.  The new task is fix sink.  You might also have "wash dishes in bathtub", but yeah your previous plan is out the window.  :-(  You should definitely abort your previous commitment.</div>

<div class="content">In computer problem solving, the tendency is to think "maybe if I just...". You never know what is going to fix the problem until it's fixed, or how long until that will happen. Sometimes it is better to stop and let your mind think it through for a while first.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Bob. As another IT worker, catching "when things go weird" in SF, makes a lot of sense to me too. My common experience when programming is another version of "super focussed", where everything else is out of focus other the the program, including time, except maybe for stomach or bladder. ;-)</div>
