<div class="content">Mark, <br><br>My favorite timer, Time Timer, which gives you a visual representation of the passage of time,  has a software version. I have it and use it all the time. (<a href="http://www.timetimer.com/products/software.php" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.timetimer.com/products/software.php</a> ) They also now have an iPhone app.<br><br>Hope that's helpful!</div>

<div class="content">If you have Outlook, you can easily set up the Task reminders to do just what you want. For the first occurrence just set a task for 15 mins from the current time (although the drop down menu doesn't give a 15 min option, you can type the time in manually). Then when the alarm goes off, put it on 15 mins snooze. You can continue doing that all day.<br><br>P.S, It's only fair to say that I use a Time Timer myself (the physical version) myself and love it. I haven't tried the software version though.</div>

<div class="content">For Windows, Google "instant boss", which was my timer of choice. Very easy to use.</div>

<div class="content">Mark T,<br><br>You can download a freeware timer from <a href="http://www.online-stopwatch.com/." target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.online-stopwatch.com/.</a>  Despite the site name, it downloads as a self-contained HTML file that can sit on your desktop or anywhere convenient. Very simple - I haven't investigated the alarm sound options.<br><br>Chris</div>

<div class="content">There is also Workrave ( <a href="http://www.workrave.org/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.workrave.org/</a> ) which has timers you can set and even has some exercises built in to it. Very customizable and it is free.<br><br>clay</div>

<div class="content">If you have a Mac, you might try Minuteur –<br><br><a href="http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/23013" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/23013</a><br><a href="http://phg-home.com/index_mac.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://phg-home.com/index_mac.html</a><br><br>– which I really liked, but haven't used for a while. I believe the program used to be freeware, but it's now USD 5.90 shareware.</div>

<div class="content">I second WorkRave.  It's very good, and very annoying when it needs to be.</div>
