<div class="content">Hi, <br><br>if there are some Mac people here who consider buying the MacHeist 3 bundle - <a href="http://www.macheist.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.macheist.com</a> - of MacApps at the very last minute (there are only a few hours left atm), it would be nice if they (two are enough) used my referral link to do so and then I could get the Koingo Utility package - <a href="http://www.koingosw.com/products/bundle_utilitypackage.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.koingosw.com/products/bundle_utilitypackage.php</a> - (which includes Librarian Pro and several other useful apps) and Ambrosia's pop-pop game - <a href="http://www.ambrosiasw.com/games/pop-pop/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ambrosiasw.com/games/pop-pop/</a> . <br><br>How is this time managment related? One of the apps in the bundle is the nice new time management/organizing app The Hit List - <a href="http://www.potionfactory.com/thehitlist/" rel="nofollow">http://www.potionfactory.com/thehitlist/</a>  - which has gotten some great reviews in comparison to Things and OmniFocus. Another one is PhoneView - <a href="http://ecamm.com/mac/phoneview/" rel="nofollow">http://ecamm.com/mac/phoneview/</a> - which lets you access notes, call history and disk storage on your iPhone/iPod touch. And you can also get Delicious Library 2 - <a href="http://delicious-monster.com/" rel="nofollow">http://delicious-monster.com/</a> - for free (which manages your DVDs, books, CDs etc.). For Delicious Library, see the directions on the MacHeist web page.<br><br>The first one to use the referral link can get my license for the pop-pop game for free (I get the license for the game for the first referral, and I give it away immediately), the second can get two of the Koingo Utilities (but not Librarian Pro, Data Guardian, E-Mail Commander or Alarm Clock Pro, all of which I'd like to keep myself); the remaining candidates are the wireless network scanner AirRadar, the program uninstaller Amnesia, the monitoring tool Digital Sentry, the display management tool Display Maestro, the batch image processing tool Image Smith, the system utilities MacCleanse and MacPilot which make managing your Mac easier and the file sharing tool (for local networks) Swift Share. <br>Please note that I can only serve the first two.<br><br>Oh, and 25% of the sales of MacHeist are given to charities (you can choose from a list).</div>

<div class="content">Oops, sorry, forgot the most important paragraph: <br><br>The MacHeist bundle consists of 14 (!) Mac apps that have a list price of 900 $ and it costs only 39 $ (!!). 16 apps, if you count Delicious Library and another game in.</div>

<div class="content">Okay, forgot one more thing: the link! <br><br><a href="http://www.macheist.com/bundle/u/54316/" rel="nofollow">http://www.macheist.com/bundle/u/54316/</a></div>

<div class="content">Already bought mine :) I'm currently checking out The Hit List as a project manager. It is officially a GTD app but you wouldn't know it just by looking at it. So far, none of that GTD stuff has gotten in my way. I think this might mesh nicely with my AF list.</div>

<div class="content">Yeah, should have had this idea earlier. I discovered the MacHeist pretty late, and didn't have time to play with The Hit List before I bought the bundle. It looks pretty slick, and there are some things I disliked from Things which look better here. Can't tell about any bugs, though.<br><br>BTW: Please note that the link in the first post of mine is  *not* a referral link (the one in the third post is) and won't work to get the additional apps (unfortunately, posts can't be edited here, and I made those posts rather hastily, as you can tell).</div>
