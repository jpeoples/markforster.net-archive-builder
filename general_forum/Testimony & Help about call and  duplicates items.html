<div class="content">Hello, Since 3days i have been working with autofocus. i am right with the forum. I feel more concentrate since i use AF and more imaginative too. There is something i can't solve may be i missed something.<br><br>1. I have a lot of items and during the day i see that i write a lot of new one. Some are new information, some are ideas and item about past events. <br>Even if i do everything conscienciously there are a lot of duplicate items.<br><br>How do you treat them ? When you have a new item do you read all your pages to see if it is not already writen ?<br><br>2. I have a lot of call per day and a lot of message waiting for people to call me back. Sometime they call me back right away but sometime they call me bak 2 / 6 days after !!!. Usualy i mark them like M$ Mars/2/Monday<br>How do you solve this problem ? <br><br>3. In the day i have some task that i must absolutly do. Old or new. How do you treat this. Do you have a red marker or do you cross them in the past and report it on your last page ? <br><br>Thanks for the answer<br><br></div>

<div class="content">1. I don't bother with avoiding duplicate items. That's just unnecessary overhead in my opinion. If I have a task twice on my list and I finished it and I get to the second place where I wrote it down, in general I still remember doing it and just mark it as done then.<br><br>2. I don't have that many "waiting for"s on my list, so I just write things like "Mr X called yet?" or "Customer x paid bill yet?". Everytime I get to that task, I just check if the condition is fulfilled, then either mark it as done or rewrite it. Adding a date sounds sensible.<br><br>3. If something has to be done on a specific day, it doesn't belong on the autofocus list, but on a calendar or similar reminder tool.<br></div>

<div class="content">(1) That's really no problem with AF. It doesn't matter how many times a task exists in the list. I concur with Andreas. In addition: If you already moved on with the task (but didn't complete it) and already added it to the end of the list, you may or may not take some more action on it when you stumble across it on another page. If you do so repeatedly, the 'duplicates' will finally meet somewhere at the end of the list. You might like to delete one of them then.<br> <br>(2) That's one of the situations where you can really reap the benefits of a digital solution. When someone you created a 'Waiting for' item for calls you, you can use the search function to look up the item, and delete it, or look at additional notes you created for the item (another advantage of going digital). With a paper implementation, you have to remember that this item is obsolete once you come across it while working through your list. I have lots of 'Waiting for' items, and this bothers me with my current (paper) solution. A similar problem is caused by 'Agenda' items (multiple issues to discuss with someone) distributed across the list. I haven't found a good way to deal with those yet. <br>However, if all you want is to get those items 'out of the way', you could put them into your calendar on a future date, or into a tickler file or any other reminder system.<br><br>(3) For tasks that have to be completed today, it comes down to Mark's advice that you should do one complete pass of the whole list every day. If you keep up with that, you will come across every item due today at some time today. Another solution that has been proposed here is an additional index card (or post-it note) for same-day urgent items. However, the consensus here seems to be that this doesn't go well with AF. I have similar issues with deadlines that are even shorter than 'today'. No good solution for those yet. For tasks that you must do on a later date than today, I agree with Andreas.</div>

<div class="content">3. I write the due date left of the check-off box and highlight it using a yellow highlighter (naturally only tasks with a fixed deadline). Every morning I scan my complete list for tasks due today.</div>

<div class="content">Alex:<br><br>I use a small piece of paper for items which need to be actioned before I am reasonably likely to reach them on the list. I treat them as part of the page I am currently on.<br><br>The essential thing though is not to let this develop into a huge list. I normally have a maximum of one or two items on it - and most of the time nothing.</div>
