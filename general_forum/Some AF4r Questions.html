<div class="content">Hello All,<br>I am currently working through AF, not sure which version exactly, but essentially a succession of closed lists. <br><br>I am interested in toying with AF4R, but I had some clarification questions:<br><br>-For tasks on the Recurring Task Page, CHECK EMAIL for example, do those items get crossed off and then added again at the bottom of the page? Or is the recurring list simply a trigger list for recurring tasks? I can see the value in both approaches.<br><br>-Question about working the Unfinished List: Do items get crossed out and re-entered on the Unfinished list as a project develops? or does the following task get moved to the NEW list? According to proper AF4R instructions, would one not keep an OUTCOME on Unfinished, like Plan Huge Vacation, and then place smaller actions on NEW as they come up?  <br><br>Thanks!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Erik!  Your questions are reasonable, and your purported answers are reasonable too.  Things might work very well doing as you propose.  However, the intention for the system was like this:<br><br>If you work on a recurring item, rewrite it on the bottom of the recurring page.<br>If you work on but don't finish a an item, whether from the open, closed, or unfinished list, re-enter it in the unfinished list at the bottom.<br>Whatever you had in your list is what you rewrite.<br><br>For Unfinished, Mark's intention was NOT to have a list of projects that generate New tasks.  The intent was to have modest projects that you work on directly.<br><br>E.g. "Plan huge vacation": Normally you wouldn't leave that on the list.  It's too big.  "Plan normal vacation" would be a better size because there's less planning.  But if you are aiming for a big vacation, "Choose a destination (planning vacation)" is better sized.    <br><br>Regardless of which you write, work on exactly what you wrote.  As you work on that item, re-enter it in Unfinished until you are finished whatever you called for.  (If later you decide it's too big, downsize it so you can get it done.)  Then when you finish, you might enter a next step as a new item.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the clarifications, Alan. I have started a fresh AF4R system on a legal pad on my office desk. I figure that working the system will teach me more about it than writing about it. I am eager to see how it goes. My only concern now would be whether to combine work and home in this system...   When I was working AF1,2 etc I was using 2 notebooks.<br><br>Best,<br>Erik</div>
