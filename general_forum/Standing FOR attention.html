<div class="content">Just a post to follow up on my thread last year on standing instead of sitting at one's desk or workstation.<br><br>I've been standing at my home office desk when working during the last three months and have found:<br>- decline in back pain and discomfort<br>- incline in ability to concentrate<br>- declining waist statistics, not enough, but better than no improvement.<br>- better posture<br>- ability to move around during phone calls<br><br>In truth I only sit down for any length of time in the evenings in the lounge.  I have a kitchen barstool in the space in the centre underneath the desktop, but only use this occasionally to put one of my feet on the horizontal cross pieces near the bottom of the stool legs. <br><br>I really urge anyone with back/posture problems (other than major ones) to try working standing at one's desk.  My conversion only cost me two Really Useful Storage boxes (front-end opening flap so I can use the space inside), each placed on one of the two two-drawer filing cabinets and then the worktop placed on top of the boxes. <br><br>Now my next problem will be to get a wooden folding "platform" to place on top of my desk at my next assignment office in Damascus next month; the work surface will be smaller than a standard desk top, but big enough for my notebook, external keyboard, external monitor and any files I need next to my computer.<br><br>There are lots of web references such as this one  <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/1001-standing-versus-sitting," rel="nofollow">http://37signals.com/svn/posts/1001-standing-versus-sitting,</a> go to this site and RIL it if you're too busy right now.<br><br>RIL?  <a href="http://readitlaterlist.com/" rel="nofollow">http://readitlaterlist.com/</a> (with thanks to Alan B).</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for this great idea roger! I'm having loads of problems with my posture due to hours sat at the office or driving around. What a simple but profoundly useful idea!</div>

<div class="content"><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/711912" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/711912</a><br><br>I am at the 1-year mark for standing at the desk. On April 1, I removed the wobbly bricks I had placed under my desk for more stable cinder blocks. I still have those cinder blocks. <br><br>My neck problem ended long ago. I've since been reading a lot suggesting that neck and back problems are often of psychosomatic origin. My current view is that standing at the desk is a good idea, regardless of its effects on neck or back pain. Roger suggests, and I agree, that there is an increase in ability to concentrate. And I would add that there is an overall increase in effectiveness.<br><br>A side benefit is that visitors to my office will now often stand beside me at the desk. It seems somewhat awkward to have me standing and them sitting below me. When they are standing, they tend to be more likely to get to the heart of whatever it is they want to say.</div>

<div class="content">I don't often have back trouble though I sit at a desk most of my day.  It does take an appropriate chair design though.  I don't have feet or leg problems either and I am a long-time runner with no complaints there.  Yet there is one thing I can't handle well and that is standing.  I can do it for 20 minutes okay, but my feet get tired after that and ask to be relieved of the pressure.  So I sit down and everything is better again.</div>

<div class="content">You're lucky, Alan, probably in the minority, depending on your age!<br><br>I reckon your running has helped, not much body or back contact in that pastime although a friend of mine was told in this early 50s to give up running/jogging for the sake of his spine, so he took up walking in quite a big way.  I suspect Tony, like me,  also played a lot of rugby in his younger years, the advancing years peel away the protective cover and the old injuries manifest themselves.<br><br>A good chair is indeed a big factor, many's the time I've arrived on an assignment to find very basic or broken chairs!</div>

<div class="content">I've also seen recommended those giant exercise balls.  They seem silly, but I understand that they keep you alert, active, and upright even as you sit at your desk on the ball.</div>

<div class="content">Yes, I've read about them as well, but nnot for my home office, my desk adjustment is very manual, heavy!<br><br>Maybe I'll try one of those balls in the lounge where I find the sofas too soft.  If the exercise balls work, I may take a couple with me on my next assignment, deflated at first.</div>

<div class="content">Leon,<br><br>In case you want see my set-up, I've put the link below.<br><br>As I've just started using DropBox (see another thread), let me know if you have any problems.  <br><br>Two of the photos were taken when I was on assignment in Dar es Salaam in Tanzania in October and decided to do something about my back pain.  That's why I'm using a HP printer box as a desktop.  I was in shorts and T-shirt because we were working on a public holiday revising a project plan using Excel, hence the projector, image on the wall.<br><br><a href="http://www.dropbox.com/gallery/5284941/2/Standing%20at%20desk" rel="nofollow">http://www.dropbox.com/gallery/5284941/2/Standing%20at%20desk</a><br><br>Roger J</div>

<div class="content">The other photos in the gallery are from very good South African friends at a wedding of their Indian friend in India in January.<br><br>Kevin is my testbed for trying out IT stuff, he got the photos and added his two.<br><br>R</div>

<div class="content">RogerJ, <br><br>Thanks so much for sharing your pictures! <br><br>I have a very tight left hip flexor (I hit the soccer ball HARD during my weekly match) & my Physiotherapist is convinced the issue is prolonged sitting rather than the soccer. And I think he's right. <br><br>I'm certainly going to look into a standing scenario, thanks again!</div>
