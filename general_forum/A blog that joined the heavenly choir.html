<div class="content">I stumbled across a blog entry made by Mark on October 14th, 2013 - <a href="../blog/Nothing Much To Go On.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2013/10/14/nothing-much-to-go-on.html</a> - in which he announces a new and more personal blog, called "Nothing Much To Go On". The link given there no longer works, and there are no later mentions of the blog.<br><br>Mark, or anyone - do any traces of that blog survive?<br><br>Perhaps it's flourishing under another name?</div>
