<div class="content">There has been many mentions of support mechanisms to DWM. A tantalizing glimpse into others systems. Can you describe how you support your DWM list.  For example 'ticklers', checklists, and so on?  I'm not the best organised, but I know if I go too over the top it could be a mistake. Similarly if I don't cover all the bases then something will slip through the net.</div>

<div class="content">Alison<br><br>I start each morning by tidying my office if its a tip and then clearing my in-boxes (e-mail and post).  By clear I mean deal with it if its easy and quick or just list it in DWM if not.  Then I run thru the DWM list for anything where my world will collapse if I don't do it that day - these get highlighted.  Then I work on my current initiative if I can be bothered.  Then I make a coffee.  Then I potter round my DWM list as I fancy.<br><br>Anything where I need a specific date reminder I put in my outlook diary that synchs to my iphone by magic.  Jobs the recur or where I need a few reminders before the deadline I put in my tickler system - memotome.com which sends me e-mail reminders.  When the reminder arrives I either action or just pop the task in DWM.<br><br>My DWM list is in excel.  I use other tabs on the same spreadsheet for my annual goals and have 3/4 others for projects where I need space to job notes to breakdown the tasks or keep track of things.<br><br>For everyone in the UK: simples.</div>

<div class="content">Great tip for memotome.com  - never heard of that site before and great for those regular tasks that you don't want in your diary.</div>

<div class="content">I use Google calendar for reminders of important due dates, but also for ticklers.  <br><br>If I think of something that I'd like to do, but I know it's not important or urgent enough to work on in the next month, I enter it into Google Calendar a month or two ahead and set an email reminder.  When the reminder comes, I can decide whether to add it the task to my DWM +30 page so that I'll start work on it sometime soon, or whether to leave it as a tickler, ie re-add it to Google Calendar another month or so ahead.</div>

<div class="content">I use GTD.  That means I have the full filing cabinet, calendar, tickler file, and so on that goes along with GTD.  But I have taken all my GTD next actions out of their context lists and put them into DWM.  Whee!</div>

<div class="content">I'm also a calendar user.  My DWM list is a point of entry for everything that occurs to me that I might want to do, but many things get pushed off into the calendar for times when it would be more reasonable to do them, with reminders set appropriately.  Ditto for things like monthly recurring tasks.<br><br>Project lists and planning get managed separately - either in Journler or in Together (both are "notebook" type applications in the same general family as OneNote and Evernote).</div>
