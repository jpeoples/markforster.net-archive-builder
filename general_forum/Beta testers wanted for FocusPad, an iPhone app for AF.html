<div class="content">Hi all.<br><br>I know that many of you are hungry for an iPhone app to use with AF. There are some out there that work okay for this, but they all have their shortcomings.<br><br>The good news is that I have created an iPhone app called FocusPad that is ideally suited for using with AF. It is page-oriented and allows tasks to be easily removed, highlighted, or moved to the end. You can see some screenshots at:<br><br>    <a href="http://blog.7actionsdev.com/2009/08/focuspad.html" rel="nofollow">http://blog.7actionsdev.com/2009/08/focuspad.html</a><br><br>I am looking for beta testers. If you are interested in being a tester, email me at tony@7actions.com.<br><br>I hope to release the app soon, as long as the beta test goes smoothly.<br><br>..tony..</div>

<div class="content">Avrum,<br><br>I do plan on eventually making a FocusPad desktop client, although I am not yet sure when. And of course it would allow easy syncing with the iPhone app.<br><br>I am also a TaskPaper user. My TaskPaper docs are very long, with many items placed into projects and subtasks, and with reference and actionable items intermingled. I would not want to place all of these items into FocusPad, but rather just a small subset of the actionable items. If FocusPad had a desktop client, I would just copy and paste from TaskPaper into FocusPad. For now, I have been hand-copying items into the FocusPad iPhone app. Believe it or not, this is not as bad as it sounds, since the number of real actionable items is small, and I only enter enough text to remind me of the action item. This is clearly not ideal, but is quite workable.<br><br>..tony..</div>

<div class="content">Tony I am interested. Melphd (at) aol.com. <br>Does the program mark a task completed when you move it to the end? Very important for current AF. Any way to just review highlighted tasks? How do you move from page to page?</div>

<div class="content">"For now, I have been hand-copying items into the FocusPad iPhone app. Believe it or not, this is not as bad as it sound"<br><br>Ha ha, er yes it does. At this point, I'll wish you luck with your app and evaluate the official release. I'm going yo hold out for Jesse's iPhone app.</div>

<div class="content">Mel,<br><br>To mark a task completed, you "delete" it, which grays it out and leaves the task disabled from further operations. Moving a task to the end deletes the task at its current position and creates a copy of it at the end of the last page (unless the task is already on the last page, in which case it just moves it). This is in line with the AF philosophy.<br><br>To move pages, you swipe left or right, or use the slider for larger moves. It feels very good.<br><br>There is currently no way to move between highlighted tasks. However, at some point I would like to add a page thumbnail browser, which would let you spot highlighted tasks quickly.<br><br>..tony..</div>

<div class="content">Avrum,<br><br>If your goal is to sync your TaskPaper doc with the iPhone, of course Jesse's app would be perfectly suited for this. I am the one who did the initial work on it, so I would be happy to see that app have users, too :-)<br><br>As has been stated on this site, AF is not really a substitute for a project manager,  which for me is what I use TaskPaper for. AF is for taking action on truly actionable tasks, and that is what FocusPad is aimed at.<br><br>..tony..</div>

<div class="content">"AF is for taking action on truly actionable tasks, and that is what FocusPad is aimed at."<br><br>True. However taskpaper allows me to:<br><br>* tag my tasks i.e. @waiting <br>* enters a date for @done items (crucial if you keep tabs on what/when you're doing things)<br>* search for items<br>* provide multiple views (tab views) i.e. waiting view, review view<br>* enter items onto desktop client via a keyboard (I avoid entering items with the iPhone keyboard)<br><br>Still, I love your implementation of AF, and will keep an eye on how it develops.</div>

<div class="content">I am most excited about swiping between pages. I haven't found a good app that permits this.</div>
