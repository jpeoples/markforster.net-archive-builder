<div class="content">Please help me with my DIT system.  How would you organize the following items with a plan-vanilla DIT system?  Implementing the system the way it is described in the book:<br><br>1. Every other Tuesday getting a new hair-cut is due.  Not at a specific time, but first thing after work.  I never know when exactly I can leave work.<br><br>2. I want to check, read and process to personal emails and newsfeeds several days a week.  I do NOT want to do it every day.  The frequency as how often I want to do it will vary from week to week.<br><br>3. Professionally I do a lot at the computer: writing code and prose, research, some visual work, that sort of stuff.  For hobbyistic reasons I started a writing project.  The same type of work, different purpose.  I thought to make it a continuous project for the difference in goals behind the work.  However, that didn't work out so well, since the type of actions is so similar it was better meshed in together with the "professional" stuff.  <br><br>I am still questioning that decision though.  How can I better determine when something truly is a continuous project?<br><br><br>I am grateful for any helpful answers.  I do appreciate more action-oriented "commands" as well as stated observations that are more "out there".</div>

<div class="content">I used DIT for a long time, and I had more success with it than with most other systems.  So I will take a stab at answering your questions.<br><br>1.  Write "haircut after work" on your Tuesday Will Do list.   Then, as work through your Will Do list through the day on Tuesday, you will be continually reminded about it.   When it's done, re-enter the item in your task journal the next Tuesday it is due.   <br><br>2.  Write "check email/feeds" on your Will Do list for the next day that you want to do it.   When done, re-enter it into your task journal for tomorrow, or the day after, or whenever you decide you want to do it next.   If you aren't really sure, you can just re-enter it on tomorrow's list, but in the form of a question:  "check email/feeds?"<br><br>3.  I didn't understand your third question.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for your reply, Seraphim!<br><br>I think both of your suggestions are valid solutions and I will try them out.  I'll like the question mark thing a lot.  You helped me.<br><br>With re 1) I am a little OCDish about that I will either have to wait for the next day to close the list or mark the list as done before I've finished it totally, but oh well.<br><br><br>To clarify my third problem, the question is basically how strong the factors deciding wether to make something a continuous project are intrinsically to the type of work or if it is more a point of the top-level perspective on things.  <br><br>If it is a continuous project I would work on specific days at specific times on it, otherwise I would work each day on it as part of the Will Do list or Task Diary.<br><br>The thing is, by strict DIT I would do the writing project as continuous, but it turned out to work better as part of the Task Diary and I am asking myself why this is the case?  Maybe because the type of activity is so similar to my regular work?</div>
