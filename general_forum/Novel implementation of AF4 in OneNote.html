<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-10-2 2:46</div>
<div class="content">Microsoft OneNote is essentially a virtual notebook, with sections, pages, and freeform text and graphics on each page.  <br><br>So today I hit on the incredible idea of making each task a PAGE!  OneNote lists all the page titles as tabs on the right side of the screen, so it's an instant list.  (Hint, drag the right side border of the page leftwards so you have really long tab names.) <br><br>When I have a new task, I click the New Page button (or Ctrl-N), type a task name, and I'm done.  Also, Print to OneNote and Send to OneNote create pages for me, so anything I find on the web or email or whatever becomes an instant task.<br><br> I created sections (groups of pages) for Backlog, Active, Done, Dismissed, and Review.<br><br>For processing, I scan all the tabs, and if I see a task to do, I click on it, and I see the blank page for that task.  I can write notes, draw pictures, outline, whatever, and they stay with the task (Or I can hyperlink to some other working page).  Next time I scan past that task, if I forgot what it's about, I click on it and see the details I wrote last time I worked on it.<br><br>When I've had enough, I decide how to refile the task.  If it's done, I drag it to the Done section.  Otherwise I move it to the end of the Active list.  I may rename it if the task has changed.<br><br>When all Backlog tasks are done (the section is empty), I move all Active tasks to Backlog.  If I skipped all the tasks, I move them all to the Review section, and create a Review task in my backlog.  When reviewing tasks, I can create new tasks in the Active section, or move them to Dismissed.<br><br>Alan<br>P.S.<br>I am SO glad Mark came out with this new system last month.  I was trying to figure out how to get GTD happening in OneNote, and how to manage projects, when some blogger pointed me to Mark's site.  Anyway, having just read all 4 systems, I must say that AF4 really strikes a cord with me, while the previous 3 totally don't.  If Mark had announced AF4 next month, I *never* would have found out.</div>

<div class="content">Alan,<br><br>Interesting approach, yet simple!  I have tried electronic solutions and have been using OneNote for some years, but currently using a Moleskine notebook.<br><br>I'd be more keen if I could use OneNote on my Windows Mobile device (HTC Touch Pro 2), but I haven't been satisfied with the compatibility so far, and yes, I am using OneNote 2007).<br><br>I still tend to use a keyboard most of the time (I have a Toshiba M700 Portege Tablet, but the pen is giving trouble), but I like your illustration of a page per task/project, then the notes and history can be retained, good to repetitive tasks.  As you also point out, you can just move an active task to the Backlog section.<br><br>I work abroad out of the UK on short-term assignments (currently in Tanzania, next month Egypt), so I also use Context Pages to note tasks that I cannot physically do at my current location.  It would be so easy to drag them from a Context (eg Home Office when I return) to the Active List.<br><br>But I'll still keep a small paper notebook!<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Roger J</div>

<div class="content">Ingenious.<br><br>Or you could use a flagged task list and record any supporting details on a separate page, hyperlinked to the task description.<br><br>If you haven't explored this feature (took me a couple of years to get to it), hyperlinking around OneNote is very easy and intuitive. Right clicking on almost anything usually gives you an option to create a hyperlink.  A couple of clicks and a ctrl V should do it.<br><br>This gives you a bit more control over the list itself, including a mark for the current task. Just a thought.<br><br>Personally, I use the task list, sorted by date modified. This lets me keep the backup I need. The only problem is that I cannot mark the current task easily between sessions.</div>

<div class="content">I love the idea.  Really love it.<br>One question though...is it simple to print out a list of JUST the page titles for carrying with you when away from the desk?<br><br>It'd be good to print out Backlog and Active lists as lists.<br><br>If this is simple to do, I think you may have won me!</div>

<div class="content">Ben's question is relevant for those of us who want to travel light sometimes, not that I do so enough.<br><br>I've started using Alan's approach and like the way that I can "work" on a page, as Alan outlined, and see where I got to the next time I open that task.  This makes it suitable for those "little and often" tasks, small projects etc.<br><br>I'm just having to get used to NOT using paper all the time, but will always carry a notebook, albeit a smaller one, pocket size vs the current/previous Moleskine which is approximately A5 size.<br><br>Once I get the Tablet pen working again, it should speed up task entering, but Im reasonably happy so far.  OneNote is indeed flexible and this approach lacks the overhead of GTD and other solutions.<br><br>Roger J</div>

<div class="content">Ben: tough question, and the answer is OneNote can do almost anything if you can just find the right trick.  In this case, typing "Window-S" could get you a screen capture of the title area, but that only is effective if your task list is like under 30.  The best plan I found is to use the "tags summary" side bar.  <br><br><br>Printing:<br>Go to Tags Summary.  Search This section.  Refresh Results.  Create Summary Page.  Print.  Delete summary page<br><br>but first you must Setup (one time):<br>1. Use the "Customize my Tags" page to choose which tag you want for your task pages.<br>2. Create a blank page, with the Title (also blank), tagged as a task.<br>3. Using the Templates sidebar, click "Save current page as a template. <br>4. Choose Default template to be your new template in the active section.  Do this for every section you will actively create Tasks in.  (Otherwise, use New Page from Template each <br>time, or Manually set the tag each time.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the idea Otto.  Looked at it, and it just doesn't have the same feel for me.  Meanwhile I've refined my system a bit.<br><br>I renamed my sections to make them clearer:<br>* Done  ...............          (for completed tasks I want to remember)<br>* NOW   .................        (formerly backlog)<br>* Soon      .................      (formerly Active)<br>* Maybe Later .... (formerly Review, but also has Dismissed stuff)<br>* Calendar<br><br>I added an instructions page at the front of each section.<br><br>The calendar section contains dated tasks, sorted by date, where the date is when I want to look at it.  Good for appointments, and things like Change the oil.  When the date comes up, I move the task into Soon.<br><br>I use one such notebook for each of my contexts: Work, Home, and 2 major work projects.  All my small projects just go in as tasks within one of the above contexts.<br><br>Meanwhile, working is SO easy.  Ctrl-Tab, Ctrl-Shift-Tab to switch sections.  Ctrl-PageUp, Ctrl-PageDown to scan through tasks, Ctrl-N to create a task, Ctrl-1 to flag a task, and just type to edit a task.  It's a dream.<br><br>I'm reminded of the old Palm computer Notes application.  It was just titled notes organized into cateogories.  I always thought it was too basic to manage anything, but now I know: If I'd had AF I would have been smoking.</div>

<div class="content">Alan,<br><br>You've encouraged me to use my OneNote far more than I have so far.<br><br>I too have similar sections set up, plus another for Contexts where I can note tasks etc that can only be done in another place/time, eg I am currently on assignment in Africa, so stuff I want to do when I get back home in the UK in two weeks are listed on various pages, eg<br><br>Home Office<br>Home Personal<br>Home/UK Errands<br>Mum's Stuff<br>Assignment Office<br>Assignment Lodging<br>Travel (tasks I can do at airports waiting for the next flight, eg submit my next VAT return)<br>etc<br><br>So I have an item in Active: set up reminder to sift Contexts on 17 October ie transfer them to Active.  I usually set up reminders in Outlook.<br><br>Does your Calendar section just show the date for each item, eg<br><br>18/10/2009: clear garage?<br><br>Or do you also link these to Outlook?<br><br>If you send me a clip of your calendar page to rhj1947ATgmail.com, I'd appreciate it.  Outlook is good, but I AF4 task management rather than the Outlook structured, even with Michael Linenberger's tweaks.</div>

<div class="content">I dated all my Sundays.  Tasks following any Sunday are activated that week.  Scheduled tasks include a date.  The rest don't.  Clear garage doesn't belong on a calendar usually because I can activate it anytime so it goes to Maybe Later.  (But if I want to Clear garage after the "hurricane" and before family comes to visit, okay then.)<br><br>I don't use Outlook anymore for calendar or task items.  Sample calendar section:<br><br>--------------------<br>About Calendar <br>Sun Oct 4 <br>Friday bring backup drive to work <br>Oct 10 Orienteering weekend with Jess <br>Sun Oct 11 <br>Oct 147:30pm Praise & Prayer meeting <br>Oct 18 Operate church sound <br>Dads 65th birthday <br>Sun Oct 25<br>Sun Nov 1<br>Sun Nov 8<br>Sun Nov 15<br>Dec <br>Dec 13 Church sound <br>2010 <br>Jan<br>Feb</div>

<div class="content">Good news to Ben and everyone who wants to print their list for the road.  This is MUCH easier than what I said above.<br><br>* Select all the pages at once (Click and Shift-Click)<br>* Right click, Copy hyperlink to this page<br>* Paste hyperlink on page<br>* Repeat for each section you want.<br>* Print!</div>

<div class="content">Thank you from me too Alan. This electronic AF implementation is probably one that will stick for me. I love the way I can embed emails, instead of having to flag and look for them in Outlook. <br><br>Great for projects too - I am doing an intensive semester long university course, and my study plans are all on my AF task, with links to lecture notes in other sections. I will break up the study plans into the different subjects, each as a separate AF task,  as I go along and the material accumulates. Fantastic!<br><br>I'm was still updating my written list up to yesterday, as a mirror, and as a hand-holding gesture to ease my way into OneNote, but today I've taken to printing a list the way you have so helpfully outlined. Works like a charm.</div>

I have tried this in OneNote and Evernote and in both cases it made the most sense to make one OneNote page per "page" of the physical notebook.  Both OneNote and Evernote allow one to easily print a page and both offer tools to make check boxes and such.  (OneNote is superior in this way.  It offers better highlighting, flags, etc.  Evernote is superior in that it allows you to access the notes from different computers.  My suggestion, if it is of any interest to you is:<br><br>- If you use only one computer, go with OneNote for it's more powerful features ... <br>- Use one page for multiple notes ... maybe 20 or so, so you can see a page at a glance<br>- Use the check boxes, cross outs, highlights, and other tools ...<br>- Print pages as you need them<br>- Use the excellent search and summary tools OneNote has (Evernote is good here as well, but not quite as strong as OneNote<br><br>If you have any questions, there have been some excellent descriptions by ...

<div class="content">Hi,<br>I'm fairly new to AF.  As I was checking the Discussion Forum today, I came across this post.  It sounds real interesting to me.  I was wondering if OneNote would be useful for me.  I have a home office for our small business, and I'm the one that keeps our home organized.<br><br>I have been working AF4 for several days now and I'm loving it, but I have several lists that I would love to have on the computer, and I would love to have my AF4 list on the computer.

My reservations would be: #1) I have such a backlog that I probably shouldn't start something else right now.  #2) I am still working on getting the hang of AF.  #3) OneNote has a fee if I understand it correctly.  (I'm not sure if the fee would be worth it for my situation.)<br><br>Any advice you can offer would be great.  Thanks!</div>

<div class="content">#3)  OneNote is free with certain version of MS Office2007.  There is no fee.  If you don't have it, you need to buy a version of Office which does, or else drop the idea and try another system (there are several digital methods in this forum).<br><br>#0) Do you work a lot at your computer or at least in the same room?  If so, you may find this a good plan.  Otherwise I wouldn't.<br><br>#1) If you do work at a computer often, the transition can be very easy: Keep your notebook at your computer.  When you would enter a task, enter it in the computer.  Same when would you scratch one out and reenter it.  <br><br>Go through your notepad backlog (closed) same as always.  <br>Then your notepad active (open) list.  Then your computer (active/open) list.  <br>Then back to the beginning.<br><br>The computer list is then an extension of your open list.  Eventually you finish the closed list, and your active list becomes closed.  At this point you no longer have an active list on paper: it's on the computer.  When you finish the new closed list, you will be entirely computer-based.<br><br>#2) This means you can transition whenever you're ready, and you can get there by "little and often"<br><br><br>( Hmm, this solves my copy-back problem when I print out tasks.

It is possible you do NOT have it in your configuration and I would NOT suggest buying it ... it is probably WAY too expensive -- all MS products are overpriced.  In that case, I'd use Evernote or even just a Word document.  With a Word document, I'd have a "section" or "chapter" for each project and then I'd build (automatically) a Table Of Contents and that would be what you would print.

He called it that partially so he could take a vacation and just give his RRR file to someone and they could handle his job when he was gone because everything he routinely did was documented there -- with samples.  I actually find it helpful to think of my cue cards or notes that way ... as if I'm writing them for someone else who has to be able to figure out what I mean ;-)<br><br>Anyway, if you have a particular goal you want to accomplish, and are using a Windows based machine, just tell me what software you DO have and maybe I'll have an idea.  I find that I can fall back on Word and Excel to do just about anything that REALLY needs to be done.  Other products can be neat but, as you say, the learning curve can be steep.<br><br>As to your Evernote question, I'll look again (much later today) but my first pass did not turn up a way to print a list of notes ... which is what you want.  It is just a mouse click to print a note (or any number of notes using the normal CTL-Click or SHFT-Click methods).<br><br>If you are familiar with Word, I'd suggest going that route as I'm sure you have it and you would not have to learn a new product.

<div class="content">Melinda,<br><br>In addition to what Alan proposed, here are some other thoughts:<br><br>- As "learning" mentioned, she is an Evernote user and that might be a good implementation as well.  Of course, using Alan's method of having one task per page is not as easy in Evernote.  Personally, I like Christine's method of using one page in OneNote to mirror one page in a paper notebook.  I tried that for a while and it worked ... someone here even posted a template for it with a macro to delete task with a strike through.  It was pretty nice, but not my cup of tea.<br><br>- The AF system is so damn simple that almost ANY software solution works well.  I suggested to "learning" that using Word would work about as well as any other software solution.  In such an implementation you would have a page of tasks with bullet boxes, perhaps, so you could check them off.  Or just select and alter the font to "strike through".  You could have your page size to what will comfortably fit on the screen so you could see one "page" at a time.  You could do all kinds of things with a Table of Contents ... the possibilities are endless ;-)<br><br>Someone here has a system based on Excel (and he has also provided templates for it.) <br><br>Andreas has written both a desktop and web based version of it.<br><br>Just pick what you are most used to or would like to work in and you should be able to find a way to make it work.<br><br>- I mentioned DropBox as it was suggested to me.  I tried it and in a few minutes had multiple computers and my iPhone all synced up.  And it is automatic ... you don''t have to do anything but save files to a designated folder to have them instantly available on the web and any other computers you designate.  Also, you can share selected files with others.  It is free with 2GB of storage and if you signup using this link:<br><br>https://www.getdropbox.com/referrals/NTI1MTk0MDU5<br><br>we will each get an additional 250MB of free storage on top of that.  A very nice solution to the file sharing problem.  Just about makes USB sticks obsolete ;-)<br><br>- Personally, I am running paper and electronic in parallel.  I do this for several reasons.  Firstly it gives me some backup.  (I need that today as I seem to have misplaced my paper book. Drat!  I knew I should not have started this experiment with a larger book.  I never misplace my pockets ;-)  Secondly, my electronic implementation can be sorted and filtered and such.  I can set due dates and organize my work in other ways ... and then go right back to the normal AF4 processing.  So, if I want to sit at the computer and put in an order to Amazon, I can filter by that and see all of my tasks regarding "Amazon".  That is not strict AF4, but my goal is to get things accomplished not follow rules ;-)<br><br>The downside is keeping them synced but that does not bother me much.  It is easy to add tasks from one to the other as I prepend my electronic task title with the page and line number of the task in the paper book.  It is not rocket surgery but it does seem to work.  ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Mike: Thanks! I used your link to sign up. It looks really cool. I'm using skydrive currently to upload stuff I want to access online. And I use a desktop sync software to backup my stuff to an external harddrive.<br><br>I think this will replace skydrive instantly, but I will probably still use my sync software to back up data.</div>

<div class="content">JD,<br><br>Thanks, I can use the extra storage ;-)<br><br>I agree with you, backing up files is a whole different ball of wax and calls for a different application.  I think it is necessary to have a setup which can handle all of your files and has a automatic backup that is instantaneous when you close the file.  I see this as a way of keeping things in sync across multiple computers and sharing with others.  Works well for that limited application.<br><br>I'm fooling with the various ways to use DropBox now.  I've been trying to share a photo and I think the mistake I've been making is trying to do it directly from the website.  I've followed the instructions and if you click the following link:<br><br><a href="http://www.getdropbox.com/gallery/2519405/1/Shared%20Photos?h=6a1470" rel="nofollow">http://www.getdropbox.com/gallery/2519405/1/Shared%20Photos?h=6a1470</a><br><br>You ought to be very, very afraid ;-)  Let me know if it works.  It was pretty easy once I realized I had to do it from my own computer and had to do it at the folder level and not the single picture.</div>

<div class="content">Mike: The link worked fine, and no, I wasn't afraid of the cat :)  I do get your point though.<br><br>I uploaded a bunch of photos by dropping the folder into the dropbox photos folder (I created a sub-folder) , and there they were in all their gory glory when I went to my dropbox account online. Works like a charm.<br><br>I'm keeping the dropbox folder on my desktop for easy dropping.</div>

<div class="content">Another exciting thing about dropbox is the sharing feature. Using Office Live (the current application I use), the document can be edited online but there is no way to sync it with a local copy on your computer. You have to download it manually and overwrite the existing file on the local PC.<br><br>Dropbox will keep the online and local copies perfectly in sync. Sweet!</div>

<div class="content">JD,<br><br>Yeah, that is Louise.  She is a sweetheart ... I just caught her in the middle of a yawn ... but she does look ready to fight ;-)<br><br>I also opted to keep the synced folder on my desktop.  It just seemed the most logical thing to do.  I can, however, see why the default is My Documents.  That also makes sense as most applications default to saving things there.  Just a question of how you do things.<br><br>Yeah, SWEET describes it.  It is just such an easy thing to use and does something so very necessary.  Between this and evernote I have a powerful set of tools.  I have been putting people off when they've asked for scans of a form or something or other.  Now with my iPhone I can snap a picture right out of the DropBox iPhone app and shazam, it is there for all to see ;-)<br><br>Sweeeeeet ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Wow, you all have offered a lot of information for me to try & think about.  I am working on a huge project right now, so when I'm done, I'll refer back to this thread so I can start working on figuring out which system will work best for me.  Thanks again for all of the input!</div>

<div class="content">Mike,<br><br>I see what you mean about Louise and Rosie.  And you never see them in the same room at the same time: hmmm...<br><br>Melanie, JD,<br><br>Just to add a plug for my approach, I use the task list from outlook, sorted by last modified date. If you use Outlook anyway and get a lot of mail, this is a bit of a no-brainer for me (though I did go manual for a while, which was OK too). The big + of having something integrated with your workflow is the ease with which you can drop a piece of work into your list for later when you are about to get sucked in. <br><br>And, whilst sorting and selecting is nice, the main functional benefit for me of an electronic system is not having to trawl through completed tasks to find the 10% still open.<br><br>BTW I am toying with the idea of only flagging completed tasks as complete when they are complete, as any change is enough to drop them to the bottom of my list.</div>
