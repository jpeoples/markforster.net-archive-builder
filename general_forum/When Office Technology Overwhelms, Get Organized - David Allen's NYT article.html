<div class="content">I like to take DA's insights and apply them to Mark's systems.  In this article, I read "What’s needed is a system that creates space to think, to reflect, to review, to integrate and to connect dots."  This is easily done in an Autofocus system, by simply adding tasks like Think about, Reflect on, Review ..., etc.  But one idea that comes to mind now is to pick a task you feel has been stuck and not Doing it, but instead Thinking about it.<br><br>So you pick this task and consider: why is it here?  how does this fit the bigger picture?  when can and should it be done?  Is this even the right task to be tackling?  <br><br>Having thought about this task and its relation to the whole, you are a little closer to understanding your overall situation.  It should help, not only in deciding what to do about this task, but also in selecting among all your tasks.  Do this regularly, and you will have good insight on which things you should be focused on, and working more efficiently to your goals.<br><br>And, your stuck task will be gone.</div>

<div class="content"><<So you pick this task and consider: why is it here? how does this fit the bigger picture? when can and should it be done?

In prior systems, these tasks built up until a knot of them choked the flow, and then all I got done were the urgencies and busywork.</div>
