<div class="content">Hi,<br><br>Although I have been on this website since the day after I read Lifehacker's  article on autofocus (published on 02/09/10), I have only realized last week, that I have never really done any of Mark's long list systems correctly. That is, I always imbued some sort of GTD overlay onto it, even though I have long since abandoned GTD.<br><br>Examples: I always kept a project list, I always did some sort of "weekly" review, I always did some variant of the "collect, process, organize and review," before the "do" step, which to me was work my list.<br><br>Most of all, I always thought that working the list, acting of items via intuition, was not enough, and more structure was needed. <br><br>Thanks to following the Bounce through Lent, and regressing afterwards with rebuilding my neo-GTD structures, I have realized that no structure for me is needed other than my notebook, pencil, a calendar and email, and most of all my intuition.<br><br>Following the Bounce, high priority, deadline driven work gets done, low priority important work gets done. Regular maintenance tasks get done. Waiting for tasks get tracked and some day/ maybe tasks do not get done until they are no longer someday/maybe. <br><br>Letting go and embracing intuition is allowing me to get more things done, all the right things done, with less overhead and less stress. Thanks Mark, keep on Bouncing!</div>

<div class="content">It occurs to me the ideas I've been following lately, tiny habits and Kaizen, share with Mark's ideas the notion of Little and Often. The reason seems to be that we are most adept at small decisions and small adjustments. Our intuition engages, our fear, resistance is minimal. So the strategy of doing odd jobs and the strategy of improving how we do those jobs, and the strategy of improving our routines and automatic behavior  are all aligned.</div>

<div class="content">I did a search for "bounce" on this site, but couldn't find the original description of this method/system.  I've been away for a long time. Can someone please point me to the original description?<br><br>Thanks in advance.</div>

<div class="content">It's very simple. Simple Scanning but... After every time you do something, you reverse the direction of scanning.</div>

<div class="content">Mark first describes The Bounce here:<br><br><a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2006818#post2070863" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2006818#post2070863</a><br><br>and references it later (and first calls it "The Bounce") here:<br><br><a href="../blog/This One!.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2017/2/15/this-one.html</a></div>
