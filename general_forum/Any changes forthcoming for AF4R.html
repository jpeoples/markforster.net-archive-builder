<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>I see that you are working on Superfocus.  Do you have any changes to AF4R in the pipeline as well?  As I have recently posted, I am finding AF4R to be the best system I have used to date.<br><br>Best wishes,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Hi, David<br><br>Glad that AF4R is working well for you. I did try to see if I could improve it, but the ideas I had while doing so seemed more applicable to SuperFocus. I only started my latest version of that today, but so far it is working very well. My main aim is to tighten up on unfinished work.</div>

<div class="content">Sounds good, Mark.  That is one of the major strengths of AF4R -- the separate sections for new, recurring, and unfinished tasks.  It certainly has provided me with the best sense of how much work I have to do yet (not yet started AND unfinished) versus new work coming in.<br><br>-David</div>
