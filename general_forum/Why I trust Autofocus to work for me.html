<div class="content">I have been using Autofocus for a week now, completely mesmerized and a little baffled by the way it melts away my resistance to doing work. How is it that this simple system has instantly made me more productive when everything else I have tried (for the last ten years, mind!) has failed?<br><br>I finally figured it out today, and I am kicking myself for not realizing this earlier.<br><br>I have tried so many productivity "systems", over and over again. A to-do list for the day, inevitably too long and never completed. Time blocking/scheduling, which I never could discipline myself to follow. Listing my three "big rocks" for the day, also never completed. Planning out each day in advance, only to completely ignore said plan within 5 minutes of waking up. Each of these quickly degraded into simply doing what was most urgent. What do these systems have in common? They all tell me WHEN to do my tasks: on a particular day, at a particular time, or in a particular order.<br><br><br>I HATE people telling me when to do things. Always have. (It was a major sticking point with my parents when I was growing up - them saying "Do this right NOW" pretty much guaranteed I'd walk off in a huff :-) ) So why on Earth have I been imposing a schedule on MYSELF for so long?<br><br><br>There you have it. All these years, I have been searching for a better plan, when really the problem was the plan itself. With AF, I have no plan; I just have a choice. And I TRUST that when I make that choice, it will be the best choice I can make at the time based on my goals, my energy levels, the urgency of the task, etc. Since all of the tasks are in the system, I don't have to worry about forgetting them. Less worrying means I have more energy to DO the tasks.<br><br>I really think "Trust the system" ought to be bolded and coloured red on the front page! It is probably the most important rule in the instructions, and in some ways the essence of the system. <br><br><br>This week, for the first time since a major burn-out a few years ago, I was not only productive, but I enjoyed doing my work. How I missed that feeling! I am sure it will be a while before I am fully immersed in the system, but for the first time in a LONG time I am confident that I will be productive again. I can't thank Mark enough for this brilliant idea! And don't let anyone ever tell you this is "just a to-do list'. I am living proof it's not :-)</div>

I could be two minutes away from getting up to do something. But let someone come in and tell me to do it, and I immediately feel loads of resistance to the task. <br><br>For me, the problem with other TM systems I've tried is it felt like they were controlling me instead of the other way around. Instead of those systems adjusting to fit my needs, I felt I was being forced to fit the rules of the system. <br><br>AF doesn't feel like it's trying to be the boss of me. Instead it's a tool that's working *with* me to find the best way for *me* to get things done. And even without all the tags, and lists, and contexts, and software programs, I've never felt more organized and less overwhelmed. <br><br>What's amazing to me is that I haven't mastered AF yet. I still procrastinate more than I'd like to. And, yet, I'm still getting so much done. And I feel like AF is helping me to overcome my procrastination problems. <br><br>Basically, it's working for me, and that's all that matters.</div>

<div class="content">Almond & Deej,<br>You might have hit on to the primary driver that makes the system work so beautifully. With so many external demands already overloading our lives to a greater or lesser degree, it's an absolute pleasure to be able to sit in front of my task list and make a choice for a change.<br>There are days when I don't get through a complete pass, getting stuck on a task that has taken longer than anticipated. But knowing that it is a choice I made beforehand gives me a sense of control over it, especially if a task is unpleasant. (Most tasks that have an under-estimated time to completion are unpleasant. :)  )<br>I don't think I have overloaded my AF list yet, but I am amazed at the number of things on it that are getting done through a little and often approach.<br>When a task is a cause of stress or has a tight deadline, one or two passes through it will tell me that I need to stop everything for the time being, and dedicate uninterrupted time for it. Or if a task doesn't belong on the AF list in the 1st place, I make the common sense choice of scheduling it on my calendar.<br>All these are choice-driven decisions I make, and that gives me great satisfaction.</div>

<div class="content">I think you're all bang on.  Scheduling things that don't have to be scheduled has always led to rebellion for me, even if I'm the one that has set the schedule.  <br><br>Almond, I've been through one of those burned out periods as well, and I'm so happy for you that you've got your mojo back.  Losing faith/trust in yourself as a productive person can be so devestating as it can affect your whole self-concept. Personally, it's led to long periods of depression and beating myself up over not getting things done.  Not exactly motivating self-talk.:-)  I haven't felt that sense of depression since starting this system.  It's great to feel hopeful for the future again!<br></div>

<div class="content">Reminds me... <br><br>I was never able to work from a list on a computer screen. Not really; it was better once I had it printed out, but even then... Well, let's say, it always felt as if that machine was telling me what to do. Even when it was me who'd put all these tasks in and the computer only spit it back. <br><br>Therefore I need to organize me with pencil on paper. That's the only thing that works.</div>

<div class="content">I don't often add to posts here, but this one struck such a chord with me.  I hate it when people tell me what to do and when to get it done.  That's why I'm really enjoying Autofocus.  It gives me a choice when to get the massive lists done.  I'm like AndreasE  I know I've entered the data into outlook or that spreadsheet, but it still looks like I'm being told what to do, and I hate being pushed.  <br><br>The interesting thing I've discovered, through looking at my old systems, through multiple software solutions, and every other system out there, is that, when the time crunch really hits, I always head back to paper and pen/pencil, often with crazy lists that never quite get completed, but enough gets done to get me over the hump, or through the event.<br><br>This year, using AF, I've managed to accomplish more than I remember doing previously, and I've been working in my present field for over 20 years.  It is my busiest time of the year at work - full of deadlines and massive workload and now that it's just about over, a few hours left in the office today, I feel like I've got it under control.  On Monday, when I sit down to figure out what's left & where I'm at, I'm pretty sure, I'm going to feel like I'm able to manage again.  That hasn't happened in a long time.<br><br>Each year seems to bring new challenges, but the AF system is working amazingly well for me at work.  I'm shocked at the simplicity, and I'm pleased with the low overhead, I know I haven't been working it perfectly, but I'm learning the value of good enough.  The way it is keeping me on task with the things that really need to happen is working admirably.<br><br>Who would have thought that all those organizing solutions were just making things too complicated.  I just figured my life was too complicated, but I'm learning that the sorting out was what was causing the complication, not the living and the life.  Interesting, when you've basically got 3 lists (home, office and shopping) how simple the process can get.  <br><br>I do have a problem making myself open up the notebook at home, but, the more interesting thing that's happening, is that although I didn't open the book and run the list, I can mark complete on many of the tasks as I'm doing my quick scan.  It almost seems like once I've written them down, I'm able to remember them better.  This premise works for my 'out of' grocery list on the fridge.  If I write it down on the fridge myself, somehow, even when I leave the list at home, I remember to get what was on the list.  I do believe that there's some kind of connection between memory and writing things down that typing them out, just doesn't create.  This is an interesting aspect of AF that could possibly explored.  Hmmm.<br><br>Sorry this got so long, I had no idea I had this much to say about it.</div>

<div class="content">I agree with several things you said!<br><br>I too have trouble getting the list out at home, but more things still seem to get done than before.<br><br>I think the part about the computer telling you what to do has some truth to it.  Also, writing is different than typing.  I know they are different buttons pressed with different fingers, but you are still just pushing buttons when you type.  It is probably worse for me than some since I am a bad typist and there are too many backspaces to make each word stand out to my fingers as a particular word.  But writing seems different.  Each word comes out of the pen as a complete item and sentences are similarly connected better than just a bunch of button presses.</div>

<div class="content">Christine - "It almost seems like once I've written them down, I'm able to remember them better"<br><br>I learned this in Junior High when I not only took my own notes for Science class, I also took a second set (that is, wrote the same notes twice) for the boy sitting next to me. I aced the class; he passed with a C; but another girl got the guy. Ah well.</div>

<div class="content">Great Thread!<br><br>This is exactly what I have found.  Ironically it was the act of putting "unstack dishwasher" on my task on Day 1 of Beta Testing that highlighted for me the fact that I don't like being told "when" to do something.  I had decided at some point that stacking/unstacking the dishwasher would be a good task to do whilst making coffee - but always resented doing it.  Then I realised that the resistance was actually to being told "when" to do it - even though it was me doing the telling!!  Now I do it quite happily, and when? .... usually when making a cup of coffee :-)</div>

<div class="content">I just started using Autofocus, and I've immediately found the same melting away of resistance! Once of the things I remember is a thought from Merlin Mann (I think). The idea was that  todo lists become burdening lists of all your anxiety-ridden "ought-to's". Instead he suggested making a "To Have Done" list.<br><br>But I think todo lists have other psychological effects. It seems that creating a todo list makes it feel like it's something you need to eventually finish, but you never do, so it begins to bog down on you like chasing a carrot. Autofocus feels more like an on-going wave that you are riding. Ahead of you is the stuff you will do, and behind you is the stuff you have done. It's less like a burden or a chore, and more just a reflection of your life and your activities.<br><br>I think the difference is that with all my task managers and todo lists, I would always keep separate lists, but this is one long flow, without trying to archive or hide the completed tasks, or separate things by topic. (which is just another way of prioritizing which makes me feel like I "ought to" do it, and then resist!)<br><br>In the few days I've started, my Autofocus Wave has grown to 2 full pages, but it doesn't occur to me as overwhelming. I feel like I have the best view of my tasks in years, with a wonderful continuum of past-present-future.</div>

<div class="content">Unfortunately (or fortunately) my rebellion against anyone telling me what to do extends to the AF rules themselves - happily hopping around the pages and getting more done than ever!</div>

<div class="content">So glad to hear I'm not the only one experiencing this. I always felt like such a spoiled brat for rebelling against being told when to do things. (Even though I was perfectly happy to DO them, just on my own time!)<br><br>Excellent observations, everyone. Chris, I love the analogy of riding the wave. This is exactly how I feel. It's as if I finally figured out how to stay on the surfboard.</div>

<div class="content">YES. AF is really incredible. I work with it since 1 week and even i had for a while some difficulties to deal with it has a strange effect on my productivity. It make me like a booster and i do things easely, stressless, and happily. I don't understand why. It's only facts.I feel happy doing my job and everything in under control. The only thing i have done is changy just a little bit the metodology for non activable items and because i am very found of omnifocus and GTD and builded a bridge beetween those metodologies.</div>

<div class="content">This for me is the best thread so far on AF!<br><br>I'm so glad that apart from a tendency towards procrastination, many AFers are also mavericks.  <br><br>BTW, there is a difference between a maverick and a rebel, best described visually; it has salved my conscience, or allowed me to do some biased rationalisation on several occasions.<br><br>Christine B: if I send the graphic to you, could you post a link?  I don't have a web site, yet.<br><br>I suspect many of you subscribe to another of my management philosophies: "It is easier to ask for forgiveness than for permission."  A caveat is that you must be able to convince (with integrity) that you have erred and strayed like a lost sheep because you had the organisation's best interests at heart.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Roger<br><br>Love your quote about the difference between a maverick and a rebel - it also reminds me of yet another book which is a fascinating story of a business that went totally against "accepted" philosophy - Maverick by Ricardo Semler.<br><br>And yes I'll be glad to post the graphic for you.  I can post it onto the AF Flickr site for you with a link if that's ok.</div>

<div class="content">I agree that autofocus has some great features and has a magic effect on procrastination.  I like the idea that it lets you take control of your list and not let it tell you what to do.  However, there is that point where there are only three items left on a page and you really are told: Do something or discard.  Sometimes that is enough to get me to do something on a task I was avoiding, jiust because I know I can't discard it.</div>

<div class="content">The beauty of AF is that the "sorting" function, which seems stressful and frankly time-wasting when one is "forced" to prioritise into an URGENT/IMPORTANT, URGENT/LESS IMPORTANT etc. type system, is less stress here. The "sorting" is real-time, dynamic and internal. There must be a psychological reason for its efficacy, but in the engineer's credo, "if it works, it works." And I consider Mark Forster a Productivity Engineer; constantly thinking, testing, improving, tweaking, simplifying, as evidenced by GED, DIT, AF 1-4. I rest my case.</div>

<div class="content">I am happy to read that post. What else ? Nothing. Since i was a young boy i always been rebel to authority. Hating school. Hating whatever told me to what to do and when to do it . I never understood why i maintained for years such a pressure to make an organized system. For time I used GTD the best i was able too. But it didnt work. Since i used AF it works. AF1 or 4 doesnt really matter in fact. There is an addictive process and a kind of wave process that makes me doing things. I don't know really how or why. I just know that it works. I just know that the results are there. I don't bother me any more. Of course sometimes i fell under control. So I declare a backlog and report little by little all my active tasks until there will be one day a new backlog. I do it on a A4 note book. Most of he time i don't plan or think about things or tasks. Projects tasks comes by themselves little by little and are done on the flow. Since I used AF i feel quiet. I don't say cool for I am not. I am never satisfied about my work. I am never satisfied about my result even if my little company is indeed a success. AF made me simply operational. I can be interrupted. It may happen whatever i know that things are controlled. I know i will find a way to do things. Sometime it happens that I suddenly realize that i have nothing left to do. It let me time to think about my future projects and take altitude about my life. I also noticed that AF modified my relationship with others. It made me more human. More receptive about other's feelings and needs. Thanking Mark ? I did it many times. I use to have a guitar teacher. And I told him one day how i admired Hendrix. He said that people builds a Wall. Some bring a little rock some brings a part of the wall. With AF Mark brought a big part of the wall.  <br>So, I must admit now that not only AF made me productive but it made a big part of my company's success. Of course I made my own organization, add little things here and there as i spoke about it in my others post. But the basis is and still remains AF.</div>

<div class="content">Good post Jupiter.  This part threw me for a loop though:<br><br>"I use to have a guitar teacher. And I told him one day how i admired Hendrix. He said that people builds a Wall. Some bring a little rock some brings a part of the wall. With AF Mark brought a big part of the wall. "<br><br>My automatic reaction to "people build walls" is to think of Pink Floyd, and the Berlin Wall, negative images.  I don't think of Mark building that kind of wall.  I suppose there are also good walls and that must be what Hendrix was talking about.</div>

<div class="content">Yes Alan, there maybe good walls and bad walls. Marks of course added his part in a beautifull cathedral. For me there are also bad walls. I mean mind walls. Some methods builds bad wall arround our mind some others brings up light and freedom. That's what AF is for me.</div>
