<div class="content">Thank goodness for that. I had been checking both this site and Erik's frequently for any news.<br>(And no, I didn't put it on my SF3 lists).<br>Thanks very much  for this Seraphim and Alan.</div>

<div class="content">Hello everyone, reporting live from Japan.<br><br>All is well for me and my family. We have lost most contacts with my wife's family which was in the affected area and most importantly her little brother who was in the Tsunami path. He Only had obe phone number he had on hand since all his electronic stuff was out and it was MY number of all things O.O Everyone is safe for now!<br><br>We have regular aftershocks and some of my friends are going back to their respective countries. Electricity is rationed and the districts take turns for power out. We still don't have news from the most devastated areas so the disappeared toll might be much higher then announced ATM.<br><br>Thanks for your concern everyone, it makes us feel we are not alone!</div>

<div class="content">The news tends to report only the problems so the passive listener gets the impression that the whole country has fallen apart and half of it washed out by flooding. It's hard to really tell what the real picture is.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Erik I am happy you are. I saw you on your videos and Like very much what you write on MF website. When I heard about what happened I was worry for you. But happily yo are safe. I hope you are not too near from the nuclear central because I think the problem is not over (sadly) when people ask to Areva to help them it is not a good new. Best wishes to you and your family.</div>

<div class="content">Erik, glad you had a chance to post to this forum. I couldn't understand the part about your wife's brother, did you get a hold of him? Our thoughts are with you.</div>

<div class="content">Erin:<br><br>In all, we had 2 contacts with my wife's family near Sendai.<br>Both where cut after 5 minutes but they say they are safe, have food and water (they live on a farm).<br><br>Her little brother lived nearer to the sea.<br>We had no contact with him for a couple of days and he had no phone.<br>He had my phone number (god knows why or how) though and he contacted us through a special line created for the sheltered people. He is in a camp safe and waiting.<br><br><br>Jupiter:<br><br>Yes, the nuclear situation is quite dire I should say. I live far enough not to be a problem though.<br><br><br>Sorry for my first post, it was quite unintelligible!<br>The biggest concern for me right now is the trains that run at 20% usual ration in my parts and the electricity cut outs that we have to take to conserve energy. Residual earthquakes appear about 10 to 15 times a day but we got used to it. The real problems are going to start now with lack of food and looting and such.<br><br>Keeping my fingers crossed!<br>Thanks again everyone,</div>
