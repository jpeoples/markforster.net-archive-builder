<div class="content">In "How to Make Your Dreams Come True" there's some discussion about how the way you reach your goal is unknown and might change. This is similar a concept being developed and articulated by Nassim Taleb, called "Antifragility". Some things, when they are jostled by randomness, instead of decaying or staying the same, they get better.<br><br>By not planning in huge detail and revising your vision over time, you prepare your mind for the opportunities that will present itself. These are sometimes called "positive accidents". These are what make you "antifragile", unknown things occurring will drive you forward as long the bad things do not defeat you. This is why welcoming adversity as a friend is so important. Challenges spark creativity (as long as you don't give up!), they force you to look at things differently. The way you reach your goal will be unplanned, unexpected, but wonderful and creative.<br><br>This aspect is my favorite aspect of "How to Make Your Dreams Come True".</div>

<div class="content">There is another benefit to adopting a process rather than a plan. Aside from the psychology and even spirituality involved, there is a good lesson here from plain old engineering:<br><br>If I want to design a furnace to heat my house, the easy part is the heating element and convection system (to move the heat through the house). The hard part is how to know when to turn on and off the heating element so as to keep my house at a comfortable temperature.<br><br>The linear planning model would run something like this: calculate the volume of air in the house, and find its effective thermal mass taking into account how far each room is from the heating element, and the time constant characterizing how long it takes from when the heater turns on to when the furthest rooms have heated up (per degree F), and calculate lots of other such technical things. Then compile the last decade or so of weather patterns so as to make a statistical guess at the outside temperature and wind at any given time, and, knowing the thermal properties of all walls, windows, and building joints, calculate the effect this has on our interior air ... <br><br>You could gather up our brightest minds from *all* of history to put that plan together, and you will still end up sweating in your basement, while the heater responds to some imaginary, brilliantly-calculated snow flurry that failed to take place today. Plus, the planners didn't account for your decision to plant a tree last decade, whose sweeping boughs now keep the sun from beating down on a certain picture window.<br><br>Thankfully, our actual heating engineers have contented themselves with something much less intellectually impressive but far more useful: the thermostat. Too hot? shut it off. Too cold? turn it on.<br><br>What are the elements of a thermostat?<br>1. A clearly-defined goal, the desired temperature.<br>2. An accurate Present Reality, the current actual temperature.<br>3. An ongoing process to compare the Goal to the Present Reality and do something simple about it.<br><br>This is called "feedback," and it's a big deal in engineering. It nearly always beats linear programming.</div>

<div class="content">One clarification:<br><br>I do not mean to ignore the psychological/spiritual aspects of Anti-fragility.<br><br>My point is how spectacularly bad the linear model so often is, even on its own rational grounds, and even without human nature in the picture at all, as the furnace problem illustrates.<br><br>When you add human elements to it, the linear method becomes even sillier.<br><br>As for the "problems are our friends" concept, you might say that the current (wrong) temperature is our friend, because we've welcomed it into our design, at center stage, where it functions as our guiding light. Without measuring the home's current temperature, we'd have no idea what signal to send the heater. We don't even need or expect it to be "correct" but once in a blue moon.</div>

<div class="content">Bernie:<br><br>Yes, the concept of feedback was a very important part of the design of the "Dreams" system.<br><br>Another important concept was that when one thinks and engages with a problem one's mind  filters reality so that solutions and opportunities are presented to one's consciousness automatically. This is similar to what happens when you buy a new car. You automatically see every other car of the same make and model without having to look out for them specifically.</div>
