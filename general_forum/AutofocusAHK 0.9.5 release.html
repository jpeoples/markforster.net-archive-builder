<div class="content">Downloading 0.9.5.1. I just noticed bug #1 this morning. That #2 I don't really mind, it's nice to know when the morning routine is being done. I did use #3 once, but didn't notice the skipping.<br><br>I've just started printing caps-E pages, four to an A4 sheet for off computer use and reference on which task should be next. I then realize the "repeating tasks" feeling I get was me chasing the end of  +7 day list, as I re-add previous task. <br><br>Thanks for the work done, AndreasH. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Ralph:<br><br>Which browser do you use? Do you have Javascript enabled?

There should be a warning message somewhere in that case.</div>

<div class="content">Wait, if you didn't have Javascript, you wouldn't even have buttons to click on. Do done tasks show up when you click the done filter button and only the extra columns are missing, or does nothing happen at all? I just tested the HTML export in IE, Opera, Chrome and Firefox and both the done tasks and the additional columns show up perfectly.</div>

<div class="content">Andreas,<br><br>Your script has made me far more productive than I was with paper. It is simple, quick, brilliant, and complements Mark's methods superbly. Thank you.<br><br>I think there may be a bug, however:<br><br>I think the ExpirationNew and ExpirationReAdd settings in the .ini file are not being picked up. I have ExpirationNew set to 31 days, but new tasks are being added in 28 days. I have tried 20 days, too, and tasks are still added in 28 days.<br><br>The Re-Add Button adds tasks after 28 days -- is this by design? I was expecting Re-Added tasks to be added after 7 days. Or am I misunderstanding something (quite likely)?<br><br>And a suggestion:<br><br>Can you use the format hh:mm:ss in the Report for the Time column? This will make it easier to total up the times after exporting the Report to Excel.<br><br>Many thanks,<br>Wooba</div>

<div class="content">Rodney:<br><br>Sorry, I didn't test the older systems thoroughly while adding new features, I will do so for the next release. <br><br>Wooba:<br><br>You have to restart or reload (CapsLock + R) the app for changes in the ini file to apply. Maybe that's the problem. But you're right, there seems to be a problem with the date for re-added tasks. I just tested it and the first task did land on today+7, but the second one didn't. I need to look into that.</div>

<div class="content">Currently on v0.9.5.2. Just noticed my tasks.txt have a bunch of tasks expiring 2&3mar located at multiple wrong places in the list. I've manually resorted my tasks.txt, and will report back if I find the command sequence that causes the error. <br><br>I've been printing the caps-E html page daily for quite sometime. But I didn't immediately notice this task in wrong place issue. Perhaps caps-E can emit a warning (without stopping) when it encounters wrong sorted expiry date while it process the html page.</div>

<div class="content">Wooba wrote:<br><<I have just tried going back to v0.9.5.1 and it made no difference to the sort location.>><br><br>Wooba, you need to manually clean up (resort by expiry date, using a text editor etc) the tasks.txt that was "munged" by v0.9.5.2. Then v0.9.5.1 will work okay. Starting from a totally new/empty tasks.txt will also be okay.<br><br>I didn't want to throw away the 80+ tasks already on my list, so I did the manually resorting to revive my tasks.txt.</div>
<h2>Reply by Andreas Hofmann</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-02-26 11:35</div>
<div class="content">Yes, the sorting mechanism (which seems to be broken in 0.9.5.2 even though not a single line of its code was changed, must be a concurrency issue) only sorts the newly (re-)added task in, it doesn't fix existing unordered tasks. So if you have a task that expires March 5th but is in the March 10th slot, when a new task is added, the sorting mechanism will look backwards through the list, find that task, and say "ah, expires on March 5th, the new tasks goes after this one". And so the new task will be listed under March 10th, too.<br><br>Version 0.9.5.3 will perform a complete resort of the list to fix this, so you don't have to sort the list by hand now if you don't want to. I promise 0.9.5.3 will be released this weekend, before any of the affected tasks get in danger of expiring. The right order will then be restored automatically.</div>

<div class="content">I took the 0.9.5.2 download down and released a small fix release: <a href="http://github.com/downloads/andreashofmann/AutofocusAHK/AutofocusAHK-0.9.5.1.1.zip" rel="nofollow">http://github.com/downloads/andreashofmann/AutofocusAHK/AutofocusAHK-0.9.5.1.1.zip</a><br><br>It's simply 0.9.5.1, but resorts the list by expiration date on load (if you use DWM), so if 0.9.5.2 messed up your list, you don't have to fix it manually. Sorry to those who already did so. Feel free to move some tasks around on purpose and give me feedback on whether the sorting works. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Thanks AndreasH. Downloaded v0.9.5.3 and running it already on "Chk AFAHK 0.9.5 thread". ;-)<br><br>Some thoughts for when you have time to work on DWM portion ...<br>(1) I've been having caps-E export html page open in my second screen side window while working on main screen with caps-D doing part. Alternatively, I've been using printed caps-E page for the same purpose of being aware of where the task is in the list.<br>(2) Basically, I'm trying to get the same "feel" you have while DWM on paper list. Then you're always aware which page (expiry date) you are on, and whether the item was very fresh (added today). The former is already taken care by dates/notice in the caps-D title bar, but the second is not.<br>(3) Perhaps we can have caps-D window to show/notify when the current task is freshly added today? Another notice in the title bar? And/or different background colour for the window (I associate  light blue/green with fresh stuff)?<br><br>I post this feature request here for others to comment. I'll add it to AFAHK github issue page later, if you haven't done it earlier. <br><br>Thanks for your work on this AFAHK, Andreas.<br><br>PS: The timer says I spent 14:30 minutes on this post. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">AndreasH,<br><br>Have you had a look at Mortscript scripting language for WindowsMobile and Windows? See <a href="http://www.sto-helit.de/index.php?module=page&entry=ms_overview&action=view&menu=29" rel="nofollow">http://www.sto-helit.de/index.php?module=page&entry=ms_overview&action=view&menu=29</a> . I'm tempted to have a go at making at least basic features of caps-D on Mortscript on my Omnia2 for when I'm away from my notebook more than a day or two. I'm interested to know whether you think it is not feasible for some reason.<br><br>Currently, when away from notebook I'll mark off task done and write new task on A4 print out of caps-E page. Alternatively, I enter the new task into Outlook Mobile Tasks that I later cut&paste into AFAHK.</div>

<div class="content">I've done simple Mortscript on my Omnia2. Seems to me, I could implement the full AutofocusAHK using Mortscript, and might well do so later.<br><br>Currently AutofocusAHK 0.9.5.3 is doing well enough for me using the following process ...<br>(1) Have caps-E HTML Export page open for quick browsing of the full DWM list, so can easily have a feel of all the tasks ahead when needed.<br>(2) Use caps-F Find tasks to Do particular tasks that stands out while browsing caps-E list.<br>(3) Continue considering the prompted next tasks after that, or continue browsing the caps-E list for items standing out and go to #2.<br><br>See <a href="http://www.sabre23t.com/temp/TwoScreensAutofocusAHK-20100324.png" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.sabre23t.com/temp/TwoScreensAutofocusAHK-20100324.png</a> for a screenshot when I'm working the above.<br><br>Despite the above, I'm thinking of what can be added to caps-F to allow me to dispense with having to refer to caps-E html export page. I thought about adding an additional step to caps-F. After selecting a filtered task instead of immediately doing the task, display another screen with all the intermediate tasks between current task and selected task. Only go to selected task after going through all those tasks. If another task stands out while browsing that list allow me to jump to it instead of original selected task. <br><br>Mmm ...</div>

However, currenly I have the excuse of waiting for Marks next version first. ;-)<br><br>Wakoopa gets the version number from the AutofocusAHK.exe being executed by a PC with Wakoopa client running.

Maybe because visually out of my eye I can see in the list other tasks ahead, not just the one I'm considering. When a task standout I use caps-F to find/do the task. I cycle the list faster in this method.<br><br>(3) I'm starting to more often do #2 above early in the day, then swap to #1.<br><br>regards,<br>sabre23t =^.^=</div>
