<div class="content">Mark and Everyone:<br><br>I have very much enjoyed reading others' comments on this forum.  I just wanted to add a couple of words about my own experience with AF.  I cautiously started using it this week, with pretty remarkable results thus far. <br><br>Here were my concerns:<br><br>1) I'd get started with yet another new system and get all invested in it, only to have the system lose its effectiveness, leaving me "stranded".  <br><br>2) I'd have a thousand half-done projects around the house because of being encouraged to "just start" so many things.<br><br>3) I'd use my time to do the "easy" stuff mainly (i.e., busywork) and I'd STILL have a bunch of tedious yet urgent work to do...and no time left in which to do it (since I'd spent it all doing busywork)!<br><br>4) I'd feel MORE stressed out by working off a never-ending list.<br><br>Here is what I have found so far, in my first week of using AF.<br><br>1) It's so easy to use that I don't have to worry about being too invested.  I didn't have to buy software or change any major habits.<br><br>2) I'm feeling much more "laid back" about my work as I'm doing it.  Perhaps it's because I'm not forcing myself to do things, and I'm allowing myself to do things partially and then come back to them later.<br><br>3) I know what to put on the list and what I need to do when I look at it; it is making me trust myself more. And no, I don't have a million undone projects lying about.<br><br>4) When I do my other, scheduled, non-AF work, I am also more "laid back" because I am not worrying as much about all the stuff I have to do - somehow I know that, yes, I do have a crushing number of tasks waiting for me, but once I turn my attention to them, they will be dealt with in an efficient and intuitive manner.<br><br>5) I'm no longer watching the clock all the time.  I was in the habit of using my kitchen timer a lot and this week I haven't needed it.  I enjoyed using the timer but I must confess that I feel FREE now; work doesn't feel as much like "Work" and I'm in a flow state more of the time.<br><br>And oh, did I mention that I have gotten a huge amount done and unsnagged some very important projects these past few days?  Thanks very much, Mark!</div>

<div class="content">Yes I had very similar concerns. I was very close to not trying out yet another productivity system but I'm so glad I realised that it wasn't a big investment and that I could just dip my toes in it. <br><br>The feeling of flow is brilliant, I don't think I've ever worked so comfortably and consistently. It's amazing when you break down that procratinating feeling!</div>
