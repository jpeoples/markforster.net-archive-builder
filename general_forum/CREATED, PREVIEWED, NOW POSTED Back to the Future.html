<div class="content">Roger,<br><br>>>>  Like others, I have been moving between paper and digital as many times as some folk have threatened to leave this forum ;)))  <<<<br><br>ROTFLMAO ;-)<br><br>>>>  Encouraged by recent postings from the likes of Sarah, Diane, Ed C, Alison, Jupiter et al (if you feel miffed at your exclusion, tough, my memory is getting a bit too senior for my liking), I have returned once again to paper for DWM.  <<<<br><br>LOL ;-)  Yeah, I can't keep track of much these days either ;-)<br><br>>>>  Before describing my own paper set-up, I must confess to being a little unsure of one or two of the DWM principles, possibly because of my immersion in trying to find a digital solution. My return to paper is partly to instill the proper prnciples and work at DWM for longer than other options; this assumes Mark doesn't unveil DWMQY or something similar in the meantime!<br><br>My understanding:<br>(1) The current day (today) is Day number 1(or "D").  <<<<br><br>I would call it day #0, but that is just me.<br><br>>>>  (2) Day number 7 ("W") is the end of the closed lists, but it, number 7, can still be added to by tasks started, but not completed.  <<<<br><br>I think you might be mixing terminology there to your detriment.<br><br>Closed List:  There are only TWO open pages in your book ... W and M.  IOW, one month from today for entry of new tasks and one week from today for re-entered tasks.  All other pages are "closed".  Note that the M page is open, then closed, then open again once it reaches 7 days from today, then closed again.  <Whew><br><br>Numbering:  Mark says re-enter tasks a week hence.  So today is Saturday and a week hence is ... wait for it ... Saturday ;-)  That means that if today is day 1, then a week hence is day 8.  If that bothers you (there being 7 days in a week and all) call today 0 and W day 7.  It's all the same.<br><br>>>>  (3) Day 28 (= "M" in my incarnation) is the last active page into which brand new tasks are entered.  <<<<br><br>No, it is the ONLY page into which band new tasks can be entered.<br><br>>>>  Questions:<br>(a) Is today's Day 7 the right place to re-enter tasks, or should it be Day 8, tomorrow's Day 7?<<<<br><br>Careful about 7 and 8 there.  It should be one WEEK ahead.  So if today is Saturday you re-enter on NEXT SATURDAY.  (I'm pretty sure I have that right.  It would be too hard to think of the re-entry point for Saturday being next Friday.  That would confuse me beyond belief.  ;-)<br><br>>>>  (b) If a task between Day 8 and Day 28 is started but not completed, MUST it be re-entered on Day 7 ONLY  <<<<br><br>YES!  The ONLY place to enter tasks is on one week hence.<br><br>Think of DWM as meaning:<br><br>Your pages are by DAY<br>You re-enter tasks one WEEK hence<br>You enter new tasks one MONTH hence<br><br>>>>  If no, then Day 7 can only contain unstarted tasks (when it was Day 28 three weeks ago) and re-entered tasks from Days 1 - 6, not so?  <<<<br><br>Yes, that would be the consequence of doing it the wrong way.  The W page contains TWO types of tasks:<br><br>1) Unstarted tasks from when it was the M page<br>2) Started tasks from when it became the W page<br><br>But those started tasks can come from any page, of course.  If there is a task on day 2 or 6 or 12 or whatever which you work on and don't complete, it goes onto the W page.<br><br>>>>  I raise this because if I make a start on any task between Day 8 and 28 AND the task does not have an impending deadline looming, I don't see why it cannot be re-entered on any day higher than Day 7.  <<<<br><br>Just because of the rules of DWM.  Of course, you can tweak it any way you like.<br><br>>>>  One reason I've noted this is in starting virtually from scratch again in paper mode, I have been spreading various tasks from my ListPro digital over the days to get a sense of balance. As Mike, Alan or other person pointed out, it would be foolhardy to dump the entire inventory of backlog tasks into the Day 28 bucket; the advice given to a newbie was to drop in 5 - 10% of the backlog each day.  <<<<br><br>Yeah, or you could "dump" your tasks onto days 20 -> N so that they are distributed and naturally come up.  Or not "dump" at all but pick the first N tasks from your listpro and put them on day 28 and wait until tomorrow and put them on day 28 again.  But since this is a one time thing, do it the simplest way possible.<br><br>>>>  But as I have been creating my new paper incarnation, I have been spreading old ListPro tasks over various days between 1 and 27. I HAVE been scrupulous in only adding NEW tasks into the current Day 28!  <<<<br><br>You mean spreading your "re entered" tasks on days 1-7?<br><br>>>>  My New Approach<br><br>Notebook: A5, spiral binding, Pukka Project Pad/Book, 250 pages, three moveable dividers (for me these are placed behind Day 7, behind Day 28 and then another "Day28+" near the back, see below).<br><br>Pages: I write the day and date in the top right-hand corner of each right hand page.

<div class="content">>>> My understanding:<br>>>> (1) The current day (today) is Day number 1(or "D").<br>>>> (2) Day number 7 ("W") is the end of the closed lists, but it, <br>>>> number 7, can still be added to by tasks started, <br>>>> but not completed.<br>>>> (3) Day 28 (= "M" in my incarnation) is the last active page <br>>>> into which brand new tasks are entered.<br><br>I agree with (1). I don't understand what you mean by "the end of the closed lists" part of (2) though. The W and M pages are the only ones that are 'open' for adding to. I agree with the rest of (2). For (3) I'd change the word 'last' to 'only'.  All three require/assume an understanding that D W and M pages change daily. <br><br>>>> Questions:<br>>>> (a) Is today's Day 7 the right place to re-enter tasks, or <br>>>> should it be Day 8, tomorrow's Day 7?<br>>>> (b) If a task between Day 8 and Day 28 is started but <br>>>> not completed, MUST it be re-entered on Day 7 ONLY. <br>>>> If no, then Day 7 can only contain unstarted tasks <br>>>> (when it was Day 28 three weeks ago) and re-entered <br>>>> tasks from Days 1 - 6, not so?<br><br>(a) Don't overthink it. Decide which day is W - the (2)  - and that's where you re-enter tasks.<br><br>(b) Yes. Any task from any page gets re-entered on the W page.</div>

<div class="content">Roger,<br><br>The only misleading typo I saw was "dump your tasks into days 20 -> N".  My finger slipped and I meant day 29 ->N.  Or better, "distribute them across days from M -> M+N" or some such pile of words ;-)  The reason that would be the way I would prefer it is that it would allow all tasks to have AT LEAST one month to be started.  If you were concerned about not seeing tasks out past the M page, temporarily alter the rules to allow you to pick tasks from pages past M, but not add new ones there (after your dump).</div>

<div class="content">Thanks guys and doll (I mean that in the nicest way) for this feedback, I'm sorry my verbose post was so long. I congratulate all of you in making something of my addled mind.<br><br>Ok, my notebook doesn't have numbered days, just dates, so no problem in 0 vs 1, 7 vs 8, Day W is just a week from today ie next Saturday for today, I understand the W and M labels and that these days are the ONLY days for entering tasks, W for re-entries regardless of which date they were sitting in when started (or restarted!), M for NEW tasks ONLY.<br><br>But I still wonder if it' not worth spreading the load if there is an evident imbalance looming,  but I guess pure DWM makes sure you attack the load to head off the situation.  I wonder what the record is for recycling a task round and round Days 1 to 7?!!??<br><br>@Mike: how bad a connotation is "maverick" in the US?  I still reckon many mavericks are misunderstood, but then I'm coming from a South African/British/international perspective!<br><br>Now that I'm using Dropbox, one day I'll post a nice little diagram showing the differences between a soldier, a guardian, a rebel and a maverick in organisations.</div>

<div class="content">Maverick:  The term was fine until this last election.  In the last elections we had John McCain running for the Republican Party and for reasons surpassing understanding he selected Sara Palin as his running mate.  He started calling himself a "maverick" and that was bad enough (meaningless labels designed to make fools think an idiot is saying something).  But then Palin took it up and just babbled on and on and on.  It became an embarrassing national joke -- the candidate who knew nothing!  Then she started talking about "going rogue", whatever the hell THAT means.  She is beyond moronic.  You'd have to be here to get the full effect of it.  Let me see if I can get you a pointer or two:<br><br>Here is a fascinating one:<br><br><a href="http://www.videonewslive.com/view/260507/sara_palin_cbs_interview_her_worst_interview_yet" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.videonewslive.com/view/260507/sara_palin_cbs_interview_her_worst_interview_yet</a><br><br>It starts with a SNL (Saturday Night Live comedy show) spoof interview and just when you've decided that it is funny but too over the top, they show the REAL interview with the REAL Sara Palin that they were spoofing and all you can do is shake your head.<br><br>So the word was fine until this bozo crawled out of the woodwork.  OMG, what must the rest of the world think of us?<br><br>Sure, I'd love to see your upload!</div>
