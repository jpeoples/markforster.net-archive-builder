<div class="content">I had an idea of how to use Autofocus with electronic media. I have not tried this yet. I use a Palm pilot with a to-do list on it, I have the option to assign priority and due dates to each task as well as categories.<br><br>If all tasks are dated and in order of ealiest due date then you could look at one screen of tasks at a time instead of one page on paper. The due date option could be used to indicate the date the item was entered, an item finished could be checked off, and an item to be re-entered could have it's date changed to today's date (or tomorrow's date if all items are today's)<br><br>I think most electronic to-do lists have due date options, so this could work on other platforms.</div>

<div class="content">OK: here's my first pass, which seems to work.<br><br>Constraints:<br>At work, I live in MS Outlook. This drives me to use the task list.<br>Basic approach<br>- Keep the task list up on my #2 screen all the time (sometimes covered by something I'm working on, but still there when I get bored, file the document and need to think of something else to amuse me.)<br>- Sorted by time created.<br>- Filter to display any task called EOP (for "End of Page) in large green gothic letters<br>- Add a new task EOP whenever the top task on the screen is the previous EOP<br>- When I finish working on something, copy the text and paste into the "new task entry" row, then flag the original task complete<br>- When no tasks on a page grab my attention, drag the rest and drop in a "Rejected" folder<br>- one view filltered for incomplete tasks, one including both (so the current page is restricted to the number of tasks on my (17" portrait) screen. Otherwise the last page would be an open list. Not sure whether this really matters in practice.)<br>Is there somewhere I could put a picture?<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Will</div>
