<div class="content">I'm trying to develop my intuition and am finding my initial results are really helping my productivity wrt autofocus.<br>Has anyone really studied this:how to use your intuition to help get tasks done?<br>Most of my searches on the internet have thrown up rather general things which I am finding hard to translate into practice.<br>I relly have found that when I am trying to "perfect" things rather than "trust" it's my logical mind at work and that has been counterproductive,whereas trusting the system brings my intuition into play.<br>I have a separate "time specific list" for all my deadlines on the left page of my moleskine and refer to it "when the page stands out" aka common sense.<br>Thanks for your help<br>Jay</div>
