<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2012-01-6 2:05</div>
<div class="content">I did try one simple improvement a while ago that worked for me.  I used the superfocus model, but instead of using C2 for unfinished or urgent items, I used it for anything that involved direct contact with another human being:  returning a phone call; making a phone call; emailing someone about something; meeting with someone, following up with someone.  These kinds of actions seemed to be the ones that were most time sensitive.  C1 was the usual stuff -- filing, writing (mostly), planning, laundry, tidying up, taking out the garbage, errands, anything else that didn't require contact with another person.  I suppose if your work involved more "contact" type stuff than anythign else, you could reverse this and keep the non-contact stuff on C2.  <br><br>This idea came from a post I saw a while ago, I probably can't find it now, but about dividing work into "contact" type work and "non-contact" type work, and devoting a certain amount of time each day to "contact" type work.  <br><br>I think keeping up with the contact type work and giving it a higher priority is a very good practice in general.</div>

<div class="meta">2012-01-6 2:58</div>
<div class="content">Paul - I suppose this idea could be expanded to use C2 for whatever you want to emphasize in your particular environment.  <br><br>For example, if you are an independent contractor who tends to spend too much time on administrivia, you could use C2 for "billable work".</div>
<h2>Reply by Paul MacNeil</h2>
<div class="meta">2012-01-6 4:34</div>
<div class="content">Yes, that would be exactly true. As I think about it, not everybody would have the same balance of "contact" vs. "non-contact" work as I have.  At the same time, for me it seemed to have lifted the burden of having a pressing phonecall to return somewhere in C1.</div>

<div class="content">Mark wrote:<br><< What would the effect be of abolishing the dismissal rule in AF1?>><br><br>This is what I've been doing! For months now.<br><br>Though, I've been feeling bad about it and have occasionally "gotten a folder out" just to avoid dismissing a page. In other words, I have not actually removed the rule or cheated it but have rendered it inoperable either by staying at the end of the list (where all the hot items are) or by taking trivial actions to pass through the older pages. I don't think I've dismissed a single page since restarting AF around August!<br><br>This entire past year, I have tried to take to heart the notion that dismissal is a crucial part of balancing the system, but it has always remained for me a source of resistance and of forcing me to do things at the wrong time—and then I have too many things Unfinished.<br><br>Telling me to ignore the dismissal rule ... this is telling me to do what I'm going to do anyway, without playing games or feeling bad about it!<br><br>I find this comes back to my favorite "dashboard" concept I've mentioned before: show me what's true, rather than prescribing the steps to take. If I see a clear display showing me, e.g. what's in progress, what's same-day-urgent, what's a great idea but hasn't been started yet ... I will know what I need to do just by looking at it. The trouble is, how to construct such a display without unacceptable overhead? Eliminating dismissal is a big step in this direction for AF. Along with the start-on-yesterday's-page rule, AF is becoming a nice dashboard.</div>

<div class="content">I quite like the idea of "optional dismissal" i.e when a page is ready to be dismissed as per the normal AF1 rules, you now have three "options" instead:<br><br>1. Dismiss the page<br>2. Use your "get out of jail free" card to save the page from dismissal for now.<br>3. Rewrite any tasks you don't want to lose at the end of the list, freeing up the rest of the page for dismissal<br><br>Sometimes I find a task on a page that I would like to keep around, but would also not like to do there and then just to save it.<br><br>I'm a fan of doing tasks that you feel "inspired" to do rather than "forced" to do and the dismissal rule as it stands is too much "forcing" for me.<br><br>I'm of the view that anything you genuinely want to get done will feel "inspired" to you when the time is right for it to get done - and that momentum towards inspiration usually comes from successfully completing other "inspired" tasks. It's like building up speed before the long jump.<br><br>So, for me, being able to keep necessary tasks hanging around on ready-to-be-dismissed pages, until that inspiration comes, is a good idea.<br><br>I also think there comes a time when it is obvious that particular tasks are no longer relevant to your life and you just get tired of looking at them, so that is when a page can be safely dismissed with the full backing of your intuition.<br><br>If you are starting each day using the modified AF1 rule of beginning at yesterday's entry point then it becomes less of a handicap to have lots of old pages hanging around because they won't cause a drag on the currently-important stuff.</div>

<div class="content">I think eventually you would experience AF3's problem of neglecting the expanding middle. New idea: if the problem (as I discuss in the other thread) takes a couple weeks to manifest, maybe a good rule can be found that doesn't dominate the system. Why worry every page about what's only a problem after two weeks?<br><br>Proposed rule: mark for review every page more than 7 days old ( OR: when you add a page, mark for review a page seven days back.)<br>Scan all pages, but marked pages call for the following choices on tasks:<br>Delete, move off-list rewrite, ignore, but not Do. I think having a page where the thought is what-to-kill will be a healthy emphasis, to maintain list control.</div>
<h2>Reply by Alan Baljeu</h2>
<div class="meta">2012-01-7 15:42</div>
<div class="content">Combining ideas from previous thread, here's my plan:<br><br>a. Any time you think of a task, write it last page.<br>b. Any time you pick a task to work on, write it last page, do it, and cross-out the original. <br>(I'm keeping these visually distinct.)<br>c. When a task is finished, flag it, meaning Seraphim's "Finished - what's next?"<br>d. Each day, mark for review any page more than N days old. (7?)<br><br>1. Scan through the last two pages. Do any  tasks, according to rule b. Repeat until nothing stands out.<br>2. Scan marked pages: Do none.  Instead, pick some to delete, move off-list, or rewrite.<br>3. Scan remaining pages.  Do any, according to rule b.<br>4. Repeat.</div>

<div class="content">The daily process should start at the first page not the last, because the looping already emphasizes the last.<br><br>I feel this combination of rules will perfect the balance.</div>

You've always had the choice of entering projects as a whole or as individual tasks, or both. Having a separate project list is also an option (either composed ad hoc or maintained continually). For any really complicated project you would need to refer to the project documentation in any case.<br><br>So if you find that dealing with individual tasks is messy and without feeling then enter tasks at the project leval and use a separate project sheet. That is standard AF/SF practice.</div>

<div class="content">Frank:<br><br><<I also think there comes a time when it is obvious that particular tasks are no longer relevant to your life and you just get tired of looking at them, so that is when a page can be safely dismissed with the full backing of your intuition.>><br><br>This shows a completely diferent understanding of what dismissal is all about. This also explains why many people are so reluctant to dismiss.<br><br>I quite happily dismiss pages that contain tasks that I know I still have to do. To me, dismiss does not equal delete, but more something like "put on hold for now".  I'm quite confident that these tasks will resurface in due time. To ensure this, I have a recurrent task in my system called "Review dismissed items". When I feel it's time, I go through the dismissed (highlighted) items again and either:<br><br>- definitively delete them,<br>- re-enter them,<br>- move them to my tickler to re-activate them on a specific date.<br><br>In the meantime, I don't have to read through all these pending items over and over again. In fact, you could consider dismissal as simply a change of frequency for checking out the items: from at each pass of the list (i.e. every one or two days) to at review time only (every one or two weeks). Psychologically, this is a big relief!</div>

<div class="content">I think you're right, Marc, in that dismissal is one of the hardest things for people to get their heads around. I know it took me a long time to be willing to dismiss things. Now I do so quite gleefully! <br><br>I don't keep a "review dismissed" as a recurring task - rather, it gets entered every time I dismiss a page (which, even though I've gotten past my mental block against it, is still only about once a week, depending on the number of crises I'm dealing with at any given time - more crises = more dismissals).</div>

<div class="content">I believe it's the word "dismissed" that's at fault.  As used it means "set aside for future review", but the usual meaning in this context is " to reject serious consideration of <dismissed the thought> "  So we mistakenly feel we are expected to reject the task from all future consideration, which is wrong.</div>

<div class="content">Please, Mark, don't underestimate the significance of a proper choice of words. Any politician or public figure will tell you that "what you say" is far less important that "how you say it". You should know that, yourself, considering the multitude of interviews that you've been in. The choice of vocabulary sets the tone of a message, much like background music sets the tone in a movie scene.<br><br>With that said, I must admit that I hadn't thought about the impact the term "dismiss" was having on me. Now that it's been brought to focus, I think I agree. I fear dismissal because, despite the rules about review, dismissal seems so... enduring. No, it seems permanent. (See? Two words that mean the same thing but invoke completely different emotions.)</div>

<div class="meta">2012-01-10 18:03</div>
<div class="content">Interesting. I understand the rules of AF1 about dismissal but I have to also agree that the word "dismissed" brings up a sense of finality which makes you feel, perhaps only at a subliminal level, that there is something serious happening when you do it.<br><br>I note that with GTD's Someday/Maybe list (when I followed GTD), I could throw stuff into it all day long without a care in the world knowing that I would see it again at the next weekly review, but I feel much more (subliminally) reluctant with "dismissing" items in AF1.</div>

<div class="content">Hm, well, regarding semantics: the way someone's unintentional self-talk is worded has great influence on one's motivation and ability to work. You can be harsh and angry with yourself  and achieve nothing, or you can talk compassionately to yourself and make some progress.</div>

<div class="content">Well, I guess you guys have convinced me with the compelling nature of your arguments. Therefore I have decided we need a new name. Since it's my system, what better name than my own?<br><br>So from now on we will use "forstering" instead of "dismissal". To "forster" should replace all the non-permanent senses of "dismiss". So in the above examples:<br><br>"The soldiers were forstered after the parade was over"<br><br>"I forstered the thought from my mind for the time being"<br><br>"The staff can be forstered for the holiday as soon as their work is done"<br><br>"Class forstered!"<br><br>"I forstered the task from the active list for later review"<br><br>I feel a wave of productivity coming on.</div>

<div class="meta">2012-01-10 19:30</div>
<div class="content">I'm not sure that implying it's only semantics is the whole story - we are, after all, dealing with a time management system that's entire basis is something as subtle as picking a task to do that "stands out".<br><br>Change that phrase to "compelling" or "urgent" or "important" or "easy" or "hard" etc and the whole flavour of the system becomes different.<br><br>But, for me at least, I'm happy to just live with the word "dismissed". Now that I've realized I have this inner reluctance, I can just treat it mentally as a GTD "Someday/Maybe".</div>

<div class="content">Thinking of my list as a 'to-start' list rather than a 'to-do' list made a difference for me - I read that suggestion in this forum several weeks ago.  Similarly, using the word 'suspend' instead of 'dismiss' causes me to view that process differently. In fact some tasks I kill because I won't or can't get to them, and some I suspend because I want to revive or reconsider them later.</div>

It is fairly unique in that it acknowledges that both have their role to play. As an analogy, clearly explained and explicit rules are the rational aspect, whereas the associations people have when they hear a word could be considered in the area of the subconscious. And as such they influence people's behaviour.<br><br>In my professional career, I've often experienced how simply changing the name, the "label" of something will either increase resistance or acceptance, even when you don't change anything to the underlying concept or process... This has now ceased to surprise me. But many people don't realise this is happening.</div>

This is what gets at the possibly "temporary" nature of dismissal for me. Last week I had a Friday deadline on one thing. Things that got dismissed during that time included sending invoices for my freelance work, trimming the cat's claws, etc. They'll make it back in to the list when "review dismissed" stands out (which will likely be this morning now that I'm thinking about them!).</div>

<div class="content">I do think we unconsciously react to the choice of the word dismissal differently than we would if a different word were used, e.g., suspend.  But dismissal does apply some pressure that might be needed whereas if I was to suspend an item, I might not feel any pressure at all to consider it now.<br><br>Some of Mark's examples actually make the case for our feeling that dismissal might be somewhat final, especially "class dismissed".  Sure, it might be scheduled to reconvene the next day, but the completed class is done.  The next one will be different.  Same topics, same course, same teacher, same students, but different lesson.   The class is dismissed, but the course will continue tomorrow.<br><br>I like Marc's way of looking at it:  <In fact, you could consider dismissal as simply a change of frequency for checking out the items: from at each pass of the list (i.e. every one or two days) to at review time only (every one or two weeks).

The highlighting helps to quickly locate the items to reconsider when you're reviewing your dismissed items.

<div class="content">I guess I have a differing view on the idea of dismissal.  By not doing an item, I have decided I may do it later, highlighting it or not the result is the same to me.  My pages are a huge mix of longer term items including some things that may actually be deemed a project, along with things like call Ted.  So for me it is easier to make the decision at the individual task/item level.<br><br>The more I contemplate TM systems, the more I realize I want to be thinking about my business and less about following rules.  The change I have made so far seems to move things forward.  Since dismissal caused me hesitancy with it removed, there are only two options do it or don't do it.  Dismissal was just a form of don't do it that I find I don't need.<br><br>Good luck Gerry</div>

<div class="content">Gerry:<br><br><< If you are using a paper system dismissed items are still on the list and highlighted. So your attention is now drawn to the things you decided you are not going to do. I am not sure I see the logic of this. Why not just cross off stuff you have decided not to do >><br><br>First, dismissed tasks are not "tasks you have decided not to do". Tasks you have decided not to do are deleted, not dismissed.<br><br>Second, your attention is not drawn to dismissed tasks because you don't look at the pages they are on. These pages are only looked at when you are reviewing dismissed tasks, and the highlighting then enables you to see easily which these are.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>Thanks, I think I now finally understand the mechanics of dismissal and the benefit which seems to reduce active pages to speed processing up.  <br><br>But to implement it, I need to add one rule.  I would line through a completed page top to bottom so I know a page with highlights has dismissed items and will at some point be reviewed , a line through page is done and never needs to be reviewed again and a page with neither of these things is active.<br><br>But, since I committed to try my revision, I will stick with it and see how it goes.<br><br>Thanks</div>

That way you can easily find where the first active page is.<br><br>If you want to put a line through the page instead that is up to you, but I suggest that you make it a double line when there are no preceding active pages.</div>

<div class="content">Sarah:<br><br><< YES! This is what gets at the possibly "temporary" nature of dismissal for me. Last week I had a Friday deadline on one thing. Things that got dismissed during that time included sending invoices for my freelance work, trimming the cat's claws, etc. >><br><br>I'm not sure I quite understand this example. If you were only doing one thing on Friday, why were you circulating through the list? <br><br>Even so, dismissing invoices and the cat's claws suggests that you had already been avoiding doing them, since things generally speaking don't get dismissed unless they have been on the list for quite a while.</div>
