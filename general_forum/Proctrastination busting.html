<div class="content">Here is one of handful of examples of where AF has allowed me to complete tasks that I have previously procrastinated over. I am posting this as a testimonial and also to see if others have found the same effect.<br><br>For 18 months I have procrastinated over backing up my photos. As soon as I thought about how to do this my mind would fill up with questions of technology, hardware, software, time, cost etc and instead I have lived with the risk of losing some very important memories of my 3 young children.<br><br>One of the first items on my AF list was "Back-up photos". Well, tonight on day 6 I have now completed this task. I have used a back-up feature that was already part of my photo software and CD-RWs I already had in my possession. In total the task took me just 1 hour and cost me nothing- and I was able to do other things on my laptop whilst the CDs were burning in the background.<br><br>I will let the pychologists explain how we can allow our minds to play such tricks that such an important task that required such minimum effort can fester undone.<br><br>And I thank Mark for giving us a system that seemingly allows this effect to be overcome with pen, paper and a very small amount of brain power.<br><br>Time will tell whether this effect is lasting. If it is then I am fortunate to be involved so early in something that could be revolutionary to the way we approach our work and play.</div>

<div class="content">This is exactly what happened with my filing tray, my tax return and hopefully will happen with my expenses claim.  I wasn't sure if it was just the fun of a new system, but I think there is something deeper going on, which allows you to do something which isn't urgent because you know you will still get around to the urgent stuff in time.  And the 'do as much as you want, then stop' means you're not committed to being buried in a vile job for hours on end.  I've done less than a minute's work on some tasks and crossed them off, re-entering the next step at the end.</div>
