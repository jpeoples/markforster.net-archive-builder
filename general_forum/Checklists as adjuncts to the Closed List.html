<div class="content">I have been told that I'm doing the closed list incorrectly because...<br>1.  I have a checklist that I do 2 or 3 times a day.<br><br>check calendar<br>check inbox<br>check phone messages<br>check emails<br>check pending/follow up<br>check agendas<br>check projects<br>do current initiative<br>Monday: admin roundup<br>Tuesdays: financial roundup<br>Wednesday: projects roundup<br>Thursday: emails roundup<br>Friday: tie up all loose ends roundup<br><br>I have no list for normal putting things where they belong or micro one offs that don't interfere with my intentions.  i.e. don't allow papers or folders to stack up....simply put them where they belong.<br>or crunch easy inbox batches as a break from an onerous or head banging task rather than do nothing at all as a break......see?  Not interfering at all but keeping myself in work mode.....<br><br>These round up days in addition to my 2 or 3 times checklist, helps to keep things on the checklist current.  I FINISH my closed list but if I'm in bad pain or something more important and date specific comes up, I'll defer the less important checklist items to a better time.<br><br>I feel satified that my carefully chosen closed lists are completed and I allow myself flexibility to coddle my pain when I'm forced to and ALSO jump on an opportunity that requires same day attention.<br><br>I'm told that this is all wrong.....thoughts?  suggestions?<br><br>learning as I go<br><br>These contain the tasks and I do what I can of them.<br><br>My closed list contains my <br>Worst First/Most important as First Thing to Do after I've checked my appointments (memory needs rechecking these things!  LOL!)  If there's no early appointments then I get on this BEFORE anything else.<br><br>It also contains  date specific pending/follow up cues<br><br>It also contains date specific agendas<br><br>It also contains date specific projects cues. or entry for incremental project timeboxing for this specific day<br><br>The rest I batch into my checklist categories. The actual closed list contains these above mentioned tasks because they WILL BE DONE.<br><br>The checklist allows me freedom to batch the work and if it's not date specific, to sandwich it around the actual closed list.<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">I don't think there is any wrong way to organisation,  if your method works for you then I would say it is right.  I have never been able to take someone else's organisation system and transfer it 'as is' into my life, I've always had to tweak them.<br><br>If you haven't read Get everything done and still have time play I would recommend it, because Mark talks in there about using checklists in a similar manner to the way you are using them.</div>

<div class="content">For weekly, monthly and yearly checklists I use my own application, www.gtdagenda.com<br><br>Try it, and I hope you'll like it.</div>
