<div class="content">Mark Forster has created 3 systems (AF1, AF4, DWM) which are essentially the same.  They have weird quirks like rewriting tasks rather than leaving them, and mechanical rules rather than planning. Yet they all work very well because of these  essential mechanics:<br><br>record everything<br>scanning<br>little and often<br>dismiss<br>closed backlog<br>rewrite acted items<br><br>Effects:<br><br>Record everything - Nothing is forgotten.<br>Scanning<br>- you see everything<br>- choice is simplified to Now or Not Now<br>- "standing out" allows your intuition to take charge.<br>Little<br>- you can always make progress<br>- you can get to everything in a day<br>- urgent things are acted on today<br>- non-urgent things aren't neglected.<br>- once you've satisfied all the urgent things, you may slow down and do Much instead<br><br>Rewrite<br>- shows you are working<br>- helps ignored tasks stand out<br>Often<br>- progress accumulates<br>- your subconcious solves problems when you leave them<br>- you avoid "writer's block" or other stuckness<br><br>Closed Backlog with Dismissing<br>-  Proves progress.<br>- nothing can be neglected forever<br><br>Simplicity <br>- easy to get into the system <br>- doesn't fall apart either from neglect or overwhelm.<br><br><br>Did I miss anything?</div>

<div class="content">Nice one, Alan!<br><br>It's a good reminder for many of us who've been around the personal productivity block more than twice, yet it's enticing enough for newbies to want to find out more.<br><br>Yes, you have captured the 'Essence'.  It's almost like a text flowchart, there might be a flurry of debates about each of the elements.<br><br>How about you and Mark F, aided and abetted by the rest of us, expand your outline into practical components, eg 'Record everything' could be a thread on its own: everything? how?  with what? when? then?.<br><br>I reckon your post may result in renewed activity on the forum.<br><br>A luta continua.</div>

<div class="content">@Erik,<br><br>If you don't mind, and as I seemed to be the catalyst ;-)))))), I'd like to join you and Alan as I also have some thoughts about how this could be expanded as a resource for AF/DWM users.<br><br>I too could not find your email address, just a web site with your first name joined to another one which I'm not disclosing.<br><br>If you could email me at rhj147ATgmail.com and i will pick it up and respond via another less public email address.<br><br>R</div>

<div class="content">Your post is confusing me Jupiter. What do you mean by "REWRITE addictive systems"?  I have no idea. <br><br>Procrastination (please look for a spelling checker) - what about it?  Do you mean Autofocus solves procrastination?</div>

<div class="content">Oups sorry Alan ;) <br><br>Re write  = report task. I meant writing or re formulating a task at the end of your active list makes a special feeling of control about things. <br><br>It is also Adictive. I mean like a drug you need to do it it little by little and at anytime. <br><br>Proscratrination - I dont know if you write it like this in English. It means always report some task  or things to do tomorrow and never do it....  It also means that instead of doing thing you dream and you don't do anything. <br><br>This 3 words are for me indeed essentials. They make me trust the system. <br><br>I am in business. In my daily life I have many things to do. I have many many incomings tasks coming from every where. It is indeed difficult to stay focus on things. <br><br>However AF is the only system I ever tried which let me focus on things and makes me doing them and avoid me multitasking. <br><br>Putting everything on the list little by little is very peaceful and give a real sense of control.<br>"TRUST THE SYSTEM"<br><br>Report undone tasks or reformulates tasks gives an incredible booster of doing things. It is indeed for me an addiction. I took the habit of report everything on my list little by little.<br><br>I read it 20 times a day. And I am very happy with it because it never groth and watever happen everything is all right.  <br><br>Is it better ?</div>

<div class="content">Oui, c'est mieux!  Je te comprend bien!<br><br>At first I was thought "trust the system" isn't really an element OF the system, but I changed my mind.  The fact is this system works only as you let it work.  It's a machine that is designed to work one way.  If you don't follow the rules, the output of the machine may lose many of the values listed above.  Trust the system.</div>

<div class="content">Oh!<br>Even though you could throw dirt at it and it wouLd spit you the history of the earth, AF is THE most streamlined and well geared system. Touch anything and you touch the gears themselves, not the paint...</div>

<div class="content">My kids have trust issues with their agendas (planners). The school gives them out and some teachers expect parents to sign them every day. It's a great way of communicating quick notes. Without that adult-enforced structure, though, they aren't always used.<br><br>In order for a system to work, you have to trust it in two directions.<br><br>You need to trust that writing it there will be worth it. If you don't look at it regularly, there's no sense writing anything in it.<br><br>You need to trust that reading it will be worth it. If you don't write everything in it, there's no sense reading it regularly.<br><br>Eventually, if you work on both sides, it gets to the point where you write things in it and trust it. Your mind can relax and be creative and productive.</div>
