<div class="content">Hi Mark and friends on this forum,<br><br>I wish to apologize for my abrupt and rude behavior yesterday when I commented on Mark's development of a new system.  I had one of the worst days yesterday in memory -- both professionally and personally.  On the latter, I was notified that an Aunt...who was like a second mother to me...passed away.  And then a few hours late, a close friend called me to tell me that his son died mysteriously at college.  <br><br>Not a good day for me, but no excuse for lashing out at Mark and others.  My apologies to all.  And yes, I am staying here....and with Autofocus....or Mark's new adaptation....<br><br>Best wishes,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">David, So sorry to hear about your losses. (I think a lot of us know each other well enough by now to give the "benefit of the doubt" on some postings.) Sincerest condolences.</div>

<div class="content">David, <br><br>My condolesces as well. <br>May their names be as  blessings to you and yours. <br> Your posts are a great contribution to this community. <br>I am glad to hear that you will be staying around.   <br><br>--SIDE NOTE:  I've been in and out and around and through a number of discussion boards on time management and its various incarnations.  This is the most  supportive and community oriented board I think I've seen.  There is a comraderie and sense of community in this discussion board that I've not seen elsewhere.   thank you!</div>

<div class="content">David,<br><br>Sorry to hear of your losses.  You mentioned that it had been tough professionally as well.  Your lashing out sounded much like me.  Sometimes I look back as you did and find that you took out your frustrations (and sadness/grief) on others.<br><br>It is good to hear that you are sticking around.  As others have said, your insight is a valuable addition.  <br><br>I can't speak for all, but I accept your apology.</div>
