<div class="content">I have a question about the use of Dreams.<br><br>The vision is the big picture and covers my whole life. To zoom in on something, I use the goal achievement method, which also creates a vision of the completed goal and the current reality. For example, my larger vision has a few sentences on Scholarship, but if I am struggling with an article I'm working on, I might zoom in on it using the goal achievement method.<br><br>What I'd like to know from others (and Mark) is:<br><br>-How do you zoom in and out of your vision? What is your process?<br><br>-How many goals do you pursue using the goal achievement method at any point in time? It seems to me that one would not want to have more than one or two.<br><br>Thanks.</div>
