<div class="content">Hi everyone,<br><br>I've been reading this site for years, but never actually posted!<br><br>Psychologist Paul Bloom posted some of his "productivity tips" earlier this year. The whole post is pretty fun to read, and might be of interest to this group, but I particularly thought people here might enjoy this section<br><br>https://smallpotatoes.paulbloom.net/i/138928153/then-six-minute-bursts<br><br>He describes a method he sometimes uses, where he sets a timer for 6 minutes, and jumps between tasks each time the alarm goes off. I immediately thought of Mark's "little and often", albeit taken to an extreme!<br><br>Anyway, curious to here what people here think. Has anyone tried anything similar?<br><br>-Jake</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the link.<br><br>As well as, or even rather than, little and often, it brings to mind for me the advice about timed bursts in chapters 7 & 8 of Mark's first book; more than brings to mind, in fact - it actually IS one of the methods Mark describes.<br><br>Nothing new under the sun, eh?</div>

<div class="content">There are threads on this topic in the forum here, perhaps if you search for "timeboxing" one can find them. <br>I have found it to be useful to use timers. One can use it incrementally - start with 1 minute, and increase it by one minute, etc.  Or rotate tasks for let's say 5 minutes.  Mark Forster's book Get Everything Done has several variations of this.  I find it useful on cleaning chores, and spend one minute on spot cleaning throughout the home.  It is helpful if the tasks are related or in the same location.  <br>I bought cheap sandtimers for 1 minute, 2 minutes, 3 minutes, and 5 minutes, the type that children use to play games, and I like these because they don't beep!  I tend to go over the time limit, which can be good if one wants to increase the time spend on activities, rather than limit the time.   I have a 15-minute glass sand timer that I use for meditation/prayer.  <br><br>If I am fatigued, or recovering from sickness, or unmotivated, I might start with doing something for one minute, and repeat for one minute, until I want to work for longer, then set if for 2 minutes, but not go lower, and keep increasing the time.  What usually happens is I get absorbed in an activity and  I will forget to set the timer again.  Often what was needed is to get started doing something, and build momentum.  It functions as a warmup, or scaffolding which can dropped.  <br><br>However, there is a limit to how long I can do this.  The limit is about an hour.  I can go longer if I keep incrementing to 5, 10, 15, 20 minutes, etc.  But the small increments become tedious after a while, and the task switching can wear the brain out.</div>

<div class="content">I also do the incremental timers and usually get up to about 6 or 7 minute timers before I forget to set new timers. After the 7 minute timer you've actually done (nearly) half an hour of work, which is great.<br><br>Bloom mentions 6 minute timers on 5-10 tasks. I do remember once using 3 minute timers on an entire page of tasks (writing them as I go, so things I'm ready to do for 3 minutes right away).</div>
