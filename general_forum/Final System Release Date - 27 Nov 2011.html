<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>Are you still going to keep us in suspense until the end of November?  :-)<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1582809#post1583101" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1582809#post1583101</a><br><br><br>I originally thought your comment was a humorous response to Zeloc's comments at the top of that thread ( <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1582809" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1582809</a> ).<br><br>But so far, you haven't given any evidence of pulling in that date.   :-(<br><br>Ah, I suppose we will all suffer with suspense in the meantime.  :-)</div>

<div class="content">Perhaps donations would encourage an earlier release...</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br>Basically it will be ready when it's ready. I'm determined to make it as good as possible, and make sure it's been thoroughly tested. And as I've already said somewhere, it's going to be published as a book not released on this website. So the end of November should probably be taken as the earliest possible date, rather than the latest.</div>

<div class="content">How can I pre-order the book? Would hitting the Donate-button count as a pre-order?<br><br>I'm serious, if it's anything near as good as DIT or Dreams I want to read this book a.s.a.p. And work with it, of course.</div>

<div class="content">Nicole:<br><br><< How can I pre-order the book? >><br><br>I haven't decided anything yet about how the book will be produced and distributed - so no, it's not possible to pre-order.</div>

<div class="content">I really hope digital ebook version is part of the early publishing plan. I would love to read and refer to it on my Android mobile WVGA screen. I fear paper book (especially hard backs) would take ages and cost buckets to get over Mediterranean and Indian ocean to me.</div>

<div class="content">I was rather hoping that it's out in time for Christmas.<br><br>On reflection, though, I suppose it's not the ideal gift. The horse needs to know that it's thirsty when it gets to the water.<br><br>Very glad to see a serious bit of monetisation.</div>
