<div class="content">Thanks for your kind offering that motivated me to find a solution. Again, a perfeccionism prevented me to write a very simple list.I mean as simple as we elaborate for a child or a new employee first day in his first job.<br>Let me see if at the end of the day I will have accomplished these few things I am (so far, 4.00pm) avoiding to do.</div>
