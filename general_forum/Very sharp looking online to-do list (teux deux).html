<div class="content"><a href="http://teuxdeux.com/" rel="nofollow">http://teuxdeux.com/</a><br><br>It's Mel's fault. Her posts about going list-free forced me to grapple with how, and if, I'm using AF4. I'm not... though I love to talk about it. <br><br>As such, I'm trying something new... teux deux. Why? Because it's pretty. Also, it's the only piece of software I've seen that provides me with a clear indication of what I've done with my week. <br><br>Rules? I'll make 'em up as I go along. <br><br>I'll report back and let you know how I'm doing.</div>

<div class="content">Good luck, Avrum. My favorite part of the website is "Is it true that Teux Deux is the 16th greatest invention of all time?" Yes. LOL!!</div>

<div class="content">I do something quite similar on an A4 sized piece of paper folded into three (so each page is a third of a side of A4)<br><br>At the start of each day and during the day I list items as follows<br><br>- Items I need/want to do today go at the top of the page.<br>- Items that can optionally be done today go in the middle.<br>- Distractions/grass catcher items go at the bottom.<br><br>When I've completed enough of the need/want to do items I can go back and look at a previous day's items.<br><br>If I'm taking a break I can look back and pick a distraction activity :)<br><br>I was going to post about it on the 'Hybrid AF list...' thread but it isn't really AF.</div>

<div class="content">Great link! Interesting if it would calculate how many day's worth of items a person has on an entire todolist  (including somedays)</div>

<div class="content">Their info video is very entertaining and worth watching--assuming you've done everything else on your list first...</div>

<div class="content">I experimented with something similar a few years back - there may even be an article about it on this website somewhere [There is: <a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2007/3/7/dont-just-catch-up-get-ahead.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2007/3/7/dont-just-catch-up-get-ahead.html</a> ]. The great thing about a system like that is that you can get ahead of today, which gives a great feeling. The problem with it though is that it can build up resistance quite quickly.<br><br>I'll be interested to hear how anyone trying Teux Deux gets on (since when has "teux deux" in French been pronounced "to do"?)</div>

<div class="content">Ever since Andreas Hoffman created that fantastic pdf-based runthrough of AF4 I've been hankering after an application with the same look and feel.  Does anyone feel the same?  Andreas, are you listening  :-)</div>

<div class="content">Dave:<br><br><< I've been hankering after an application with the same look and feel. >><br><br>Sure it wasn't just the nice feeling of seeing all those tasks disappear without having to do any of them?</div>

<div class="content">OK I admit it.  I was looking for ann application with the same look & feel and ability to automatically do my work for me...  1-click execution...</div>

<div class="content">UPDATE:<br>Playing around with teux-deux... I miss a notes feature. I need to leave breadcrumb trails of where I left off on tasks and projects. <br><br>So I'm going to give The Hit List another try. From the get go, THL was my fave productivity application. The missing iPhone app was the killer. For now, I'm going to copy the 3-5 Most Important Tasks on the left side of my sketch book (the right side is for drawing). Danny Greggory - <a href="http://dannygreggory.com/" rel="nofollow">http://dannygreggory.com/</a> - recommended using your sketch book as a catch-all for notes, daily reminders, etc. I resisted the idea due to my iPhone i.e. with so many ways to capture things on an iPhone, why write? But using THL, this may be the best setup.</div>

<div class="content">'The great thing about a system like that is that you can get ahead of today, which gives a great feeling.

Also anything on previous days that is getting resistance I refine or rephrase into today.<br><br>Together this keeps resistance to a minimum. <br><br>'UPDATE:<br>Playing around with teux-deux... I miss a notes feature. I need to leave breadcrumb trails of where I left off on tasks and projects.'<br><br>LOL that didn't last long! I suspect the PC/iPhone may in fact be hindering overall productivity in some way :) Pen and paper?</div>

<div class="content">Yeah.  It is nice to be able to dictate notes, type them into a clean notepad or some simple application, schedule them, etc.  But the truth is, opening the notebook and just writing it down is so much simpler and faster.  I'm also thinking that they physical contact with the pen and paper encourages thinking in a somewhat different way than typing into a program.</div>
