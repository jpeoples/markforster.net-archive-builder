<div class="content">Inspired by the Olympics I noticed one of the performance coaches has a concept called "marginal gains" (<a href="http://www.teamsky.com/article/0,27290,17547_5792058,00.html)" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.teamsky.com/article/0,27290,17547_5792058,00.html)</a> : if you improve each activity by 1% and aggregate gains you will have a significant improvement. So, I have 2 "current initiatives" as Mark once called them<br><br>1. Improve my eating -  and the 1%s are to change and improve what and how I eat by small amounts each day<br><br>2. Acknowledge activities I value more and do more of them - a sort of "What's better?" list in Mark's "Dreams" book leading to what I call "High Value Days". I list items in an AF list under a HVD heading and when one stands out I enjoy it and get a fulfilment kick.</div>

<div class="content">Whenever you are worried or stressed or panicking about something, just remind to yourself that today is your last day on earth, and tomorrow morning you shall not wake up. Suddenly at this thought, i start taking things differently, and work more and worry about results less. It works for me, it releases me of all worries in a fraction of a second, and feels good. Try it, maybe it helps you guys as well. Or share your experiences otherwise. ~ Zen Daily</div>

<div class="content">If I worked each day as if it were my last day on Earth, I'd be very short-sighted. I'd spend hours with my family. The house would be disgusting. I wouldn't bother with any long-term projects.<br><br>Perhaps live each day as if it were part of your only life on Earth.</div>

<div class="content">Marginal improvement is the thesis of The Compound Effect I cited in the other thread.  Consistent improvement over time is the secret to tremendous results.  Mathematically you can take a 0.1% improvement each day and it will compound into a 1000x improvement in short order.  All that's needed is to be consistent with that improvement program.</div>
