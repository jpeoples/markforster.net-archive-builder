<div class="content">Hi,<br><br>I am trying out SAF for the first time today, thanks to ubi's excellent, clear instructions.<br><br>One question-- I go through an old page, add a urgent task to column 2, do that task, but not any task from column 1.<br><br>task complete, I  start again at the top of the page. If I run through the page this second time, no task stands out and no task gets added to column 2, does that mean the tasks on this page should be dismissed?</div>

<div class="content">You came to a page, and found nothing on that page worth doing.  It should be dismissed.  Writing a new task should not save that page from destruction.  Dismiss the page.  (Remember: you can still save dismissed tasks by rewriting them.)</div>

<div class="content">Thanks! <br>So let me make sure I have this correct:<br><br>1) I read over a page. In doing so I think of an urgent task<br>2) I write the urgent task in column 2. I complete and cross out the task. <br>3) I now go back to the beginning of the page (and not go on to the next page, is that right?)<br>4) Nothing stands out on the page<br>5) So I should dismiss the remaining items on the page.<br><br>Makes sense. Been awhile since AF1, so I forgot how different the dismissal process is to DWM and even AF4</div>

<div class="content">Vegheadjones,<br><br>I believe that, according to my consolidated instructions, and Mark's revised rules, you should just proceed to the next page without dismissing, since you did one task. If you come all the way around to the same page, and find nothing actionable, then it is time to dismiss all the remaining tasks on that page.<br><br>But I see what you are thinking about, and I believe this scenario is what Mark was trying to avoid when he had the somewhat-more-complicated rules earlier.  If you want to game the system to avoid never dismissing a page, you can always think of one "urgent" thing to add and do it, then jump to the next page, while never clearing the "backlog" items.</div>

<div class="content">Yes, ubi is correct. Under the initial rules you would have dismissed the page, but under the revised rules you do not.<br><br>The reason I changed it was because when Column 2 fills up completely no new tasks can be added to the page anyway - so it wouldn't be possible then to continue to game the system by adding new easy tasks.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Mark and ubi. The revised rules make sense. I am not trying to game the system so much (at least consciously!) than to get back into the AF rhythm.</div>
