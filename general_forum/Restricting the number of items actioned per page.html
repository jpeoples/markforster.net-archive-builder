<div class="content">Has anyone experimented with restricting the number of items they do on each visit to a page or with having a set number that they do?<br><br>I'm wondering what would happen if there was a rule that on each visit one did exactly half the items remaining on the page. This would work out very nicely if there were 32 items on the page to start with.To do this, there would probably also have to be a rule that you couldn't do any items on a page that was still open.<br><br>I'm a bit reluctant to experiment with this myself, in case I mess up my perfectly good list - hence my request whether anyone has tried something similar.</div>

<div class="content">I haven't even considered it. Personally, on a page with lots of yukky jobs, I am relieved to get one done each time I look at the page :-) I think trying to do a certain number might be too restrictive - not only that, but sometimes a task can take much longer than you anticipated, or you want to work on something for much longer. The freedom of AF is one of it's great benefits. That's just my opinion though (and I am still working on making it run as smoothly at home as it does at work so perhaps I'm just not as productive as everyone else just yet :-)</div>

<div class="content">I'm in complete agreement with what Faye says.  The thought of having to do half of the tasks on every page seems to go against the very spirit of Autofocus which is driven by the mind and the emotions of the individual user, not by some overarching external rule.</div>

<div class="content">I have to agree very strongly with faye and Steve too! I REALLY LIKE the idea of only having to do ONE thing on a page, and the thought of having to do half (or a certain #) of the tasks on every page would really make me want to run the other way!</div>

<div class="content">My answer Mark, for what it's worth is no!<br><br>But I also agree with the comments above :-)  the part of me that does not want to be told what to do does not want to be told to do half the list!</div>

<div class="content">The reason DIT was so good, and AF was, perhaps, even better is that Mark tried things that any sensible person would know wouldn't work. Of course, most of the things that he tried didn't work. But a few of them did, and we're all the better for it.</div>

<div class="content">I didn't try it, and wouldn't even dream of doing so, as it seems to be inviting massive resistance back in a big way...</div>

<div class="content">It's not far off the technique of doing a third of the items on a 3x3 grid that I've posted about.  It works for me.  I am still using it to process emails: take nine emails, put them in a folder, do the easiest third, leave the rest for tomorrow.  Though I am using AF for managing attention to tasks, I sometimes use the grid with it for high resistance items from pages that are now sparsely populated: write nine of them out on a single sheet of paper, and aim to do a third of them.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark<br><br>I have used a "clear 50%" rule on tasks for years and it is a method that works but with high resistance. Consequently I rarely stick to it for long.  The most successful system I used pre AF was a lot more structured and akin to David's 3x3 rule, and was the approach I used for paper and email and, but less successfully, for tasks. It had a lot of similarities to AF but was closer to the method you describe above.<br><br>I would list the outstanding items in batches of 25.  The rule was that I cleared 5 a day.  They were closed lists so worked on the strucured procrastination basis but as you can probably imagine Friday was not a good day!  In practice I usually cleared about 15 of the 25 items per list per week.  At the end of the week I rolled everything up and relisted in batches of 25 again.<br><br>I have to say that the system did work and worked pretty well for me.  I cleared a considerable amount of backlog items and it was the one of the most effective systems I used for (a) keeping track and (b) making structured progress.  The resistance was not as great as with other systems BUT there was still a significant amount of resistance which meant that eventually I had to just grit my teeth and do it.<br><br>The reason that I would not wish to incorporate that type of system into AF is that, having done AF I can see exactly what the problems of that system were for me.  The structure DID keep me going BUT it was not by any means fun!  AF keeps me going AND is fun.  Not only that, I have not had to "grit my teeth and just do it" with AF.  When using the system (and obviously there are times at this stage in the game when I have had to come out of the system) I have had no procrastination and no resistance to the tasks I have actioned.  When I have experienced resistance within the system it has caused me to question the reason - and so far, I think without exception, has identified the reason for that resistance.  Consequently, through AF I have been able to address those reasons and in many cases remove the factors that caused it, which is the very reason why the tasks that I have actioned HAVE been able to be done without resistance.<br><br>My old system worked in that it got things done.  AF does more than that.  It gets things done, yes, but so much more easily, and has also resulted in a myriad of other changes, to my systems, to my approach and to me!  Significantly, what it has identified is that I do not like being told what to do, how to do it or when to do it - I'm obviously just a rebel at heart :-) Structure is important, and there is no doubt from reading this forum that many, many people do want that structure and thrive on it.  I am just not one of them, unfortunately (I may have found things a lot easier if I were!)<br><br>Mark, it is for that reason that I am not willing to tamper with AF in that way. For me it would impose restriction and detract from the free flowing nature of AF, putting me back into "must do" mode and blocking the need to look at reasons for resistance. I am not dismissing the idea out of hand per se, but want to continue "trusting the system" to tell me when to move on from a page.<br><br>Hope that expands a little more on the reasoning behind my comment above :-)<br></div>

<div class="content">Christine B,<br><br>Thanks for formulating very well, based on your previous experience, exactly what I intuitively felt the effect of this approach would be for me.<br><br>Another important side point you mention is that AF doesn't really match well with being told what to do how and when. I feel it works best when I receive objectives (often with a time frame) to achieve, and am then left alone to do it my way. With AF I've become fairly confident that they will be met, much more so than before, and with less stress. My previous manager worked mostly following that model. My current manager sometimes exhibits a tendency to demand that I spend a specific amount of time on specific topics, to reasssure himself that they'll progress. This clashes with my AF approach, as it tends to block a lot of the other things that are ongoing while inviting resistance on the intended topic. So whenever I can, I let him believe I'll do it his way and still continue to drive things forward using AF. As long as the results are there on time, I more or less get away with it. In a next phase (after practice has proven me right), I might even be telling him the truth ;)<br>[Sorry for the sidestep to the main subject of this post, maybe I should put this in a separate thread...]</div>

<div class="content">Marc (from Brussels) - you may be pleasantly suprised if you do tell your manager the truth - since the beginning of beta-testing, and following my brief bit of enthusisatic explanation, my account manager, my line manager and my ex-manager have all signed up for AF and so far are reporting fairly positive results. The only areas where the system doesn't seem to be working for them is probably not the system but areas where the workload is too high. They've all commented on how its helping with things that they would normally resist working on too.<br><br>good luck when you tell your manager</div>

<div class="content">I agree to all the comments above. Under the heading of this thread I had expected a different idea which I experimented a bit: Not a rule which says how much you have to do but a rule which restricts the number of tasks to be done during one visit at a page. Reason for this is that I tended to stay too long on a page and hardly managed to visit more than two pages per day. And that rule (no more than 5 tasks per page in one visit) helped me to really start with the little and often approach. Another rule could also be not stay more than one hour on the page. Has anybody else experimented with such kind of rules?<br><br>Wolfgang</div>

<div class="content">Count me in the haven't tried it, don't like it camp.  Mark, looking forward to the results of any experimentation you may do!<br><br>I am enjoying these threads so much.  People are saying remarkable things about this process and generally about resistance and procrastination and I really love all the smart comments.  I see comments that perfectly capture something of my experience and it's really helpful.</div>

<div class="content">Christine and others:<br><br>Perhaps I need to emphasize that I am not proposing this as a new rule for AF, nor asking people to experiment with it. It is purely a request for information, i.e. "has anyone experimented with this?"<br><br>So I am grateful in particular for Moises, Christine and Wolfgang, who have described their experiences with some similar ideas.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark, for about the first week of AF I wasn't sure what "moving round the page" meant. I thought once you hit the bottom of the page you moved on to the next page, rather than waiting for a complete pass through a page without taking any actions. This actually sped up the process of moving through the pages, because on many pages I would do just one item. However, since the first week of AF I have stuck with the original instructions: only move to the next page after a complete pass of the page without anything standing out. It slows things down a bit but more thoroughly deals with each page. Also, reading the same page several times imprints a lot of things in your brain (eg "pick up lightbulbs" -- might not stand out right now but when I'm out on the town I seem to remember those little tasks a lot better after reading them in my lists multiple times). Still, I keep thinking of going back my original approach simply because it's faster -- one initial read, then a second slower read to action things that jump out, but once you hit the bottom of the page, move to the next (ie don't go back up to the top again). However, I did tend to do things at the bottom of each page even if they didn't stand out, just to keep the list active and to avoid dismissing. Also, on the second scan through the list, I often find when I'm near the bottom of the page that something at the top is beginning to stand out, so I like the comfort of being able to go back up to the top again for a third pass through the items.<br><br>To make a long story short, if there were to be a rule of X items per page, I'd tend to prefer fewer (eg one item) items per page rather than more. However, I think I prefer that there be no rule of "X" items.<br><br></div>
