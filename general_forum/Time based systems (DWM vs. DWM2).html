<div class="content">It seems that dwm2 simplifies things (4 days trial vs. 10 months experience):<br>	Easier to use (no need of going for/backward)<br>	Closer to AF (tasks are not logically distributed -new task or re-entry). This only fact seems to smooth and speed up your work (more room for nor logical mind?). <br>	Closer to DIT scheme (which I like)<br>	<br>I would advocate for these time based systems being part the AF family and so offered together with AF 1-4 in the website at www.markforster.net/autofocus-index/</div>

<div class="content">nuntym,<br><br>I'm posting this on a new tread for a better visibility.  I really liked your idea of notification and your example of DMW2 with highlighted lines between days.<br><br>I use it this way on DMW.xls, but it works on paper as well:<br><br>   New Item (nothing in front)<br>∙  Recurrent item with no particular deadline<br>o Recurrent item to do tomorrow - it stands out from the above<br>● Recurrent item to do today or ASAP - it really stands out<br><br>● Eventually all the tasks are marked this way before being crossed out on paper (when I need a paper version for a while), and I try to follow DMW rules but I'm not a slave to them.  Rather, I try to concentarte on what needs to be done and the rest lags behind and I drop it eventually or think about a way of pushing it forward if it's still important to me.</div>

<div class="content">Hi nuntym,<br><br>The notification really works for me, and I have tried many other so far.  That's why I wanted to give you  a proper credit for it.<br><br>It may seem complex, if you really, really want to follow the rules.  But I'm not a strict rules follower (my incurable problem).  I usually, on the run, use the notification to make the tasks more visible for scanning and "some"  prioritizing, but from time to time when I can focus on my list, I review the tasks, and the marks associated with them, and check if they serve the right purpose.  After some minor adjustments I'm  usually again working on what I know it's urgent (mentally seeing marks on the list} without actually consulting the list.<br><br>None of the lists ever could make me a slave of any rules.  The list is only to keep the balls from dropping.  I generally know what I should be doing, the list keeps me more focused and sometime accountable.  I make sure that all new tasks are added, if I can't do them right away, and I scan and update my list at least once in the morning and once in the evening, without reentering every single done  task on the spot.</div>

<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>I learned something surprising and maybe a bit disturbing.  I did say a couple of days back that I was going back to AF4 to use 3TS,<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2010/11/7/the-rules-by-which-i-ran-the-demo.html#comment10477250" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2010/11/7/the-rules-by-which-i-ran-the-demo.html#comment10477250</a><br><br>Well, it was a struggle to do so.  I was puzzled why this was so until I went back to my DWM2, and then I realized it: I was BORED.  AF4 had become boring for me, and I have a sneaking suspicion that it is the same case if I use the other AF's.  <br><br>Why? As I said a few days ago, two of the unique things about DWM2 are the time based dismissal and the long uninterrupted list.  Because of the uninterrupted character, unlike the original DWM, it is easy to process DWM2 in an AF-like way, but because of its time-based dismissal rather than process based like AF1 and AF4, DWM2 affords an unprecedented flexibility in processing.  In the course of a day I have processed my DWM2 list AF1 style, AF2 style, AF3 style, AF4 style, some weird styles like closing my eyes and pointing randomly at a page, and even DWM style! ^__^  I cannot do this in the other AFs except AF2 and AF3 because it would ruin the dismissal process of the system, and my mind was railing against it when I was using AF4.<br><br>Because of this, I thought I could trust DWM2's flexibility in finding a way to incorporate 3TS in it.  And what do you know, I think I found it. <br><br>God bless.</div>

<div class="content">nuntym,<br><br>I fully agree with you. The time based dismissal is the key and makes DWM for me the best system. And with DWM2 I can use it as I like it - without a calender and many empty or nearly empty pages. I'm just moving from my own version of DWM in a moleskine notebook to DWM2 - but that is something which can be done quite easily over a couple of days. <br><br>I personally see a big advantage in the 3TS method if these three tasks are written on a separate piece of paper. First, it helps to focus, second it moved me much faster throuh the list (I never made it twice per day through my list before), and third it helps me in doing the things I can do only at specific times or occasions. My problem was to deal with home tasks because they are spread across the pages and are not very visible in the mass of all the work tasks. But now, "I'm allowed" to extract at home three home tasks from the list and do them - a lot of resistance to working from the list at home has disappeared (it never felt well for me to have two separate lists, all these attempts failed as well).<br><br>Thus, I'm quite happy that I had a look at the forum a couple of days ago and learned about DWM2 and 3TS. Maybe that information could be spread by a new issue of your  newsletter - Mark, what do you think?<br><br>Wolfgang</div>

<div class="content">@Christian G I've kinda sorta done that. I follow AF4 by having a closed and open list, but I also track when the task has been entered and when it has been acted on. A task gets dismissed if 1) It was created >30 days ago and has not been acted on or 2) It was last acted on >7 days ago or 3) After one pass through the closed list nothing gets acted on.<br><br>And my definition of acted on is that I have defined the next step and moved it to one of my three tasks to work on a la 3TS.</div>

<div class="content">Christian,<br><br>I think anything is possible, but from what I see so far, the beauty of triple task lies in the three task list and how that is processed.  I do not think the adjunct list is as important as the triple task list for me is the focus and I intuitively know what needs to get onto this list to be actioned and by sticking to three things  the overwhelm factor is not there.  I have been using a simple capture list to make sure I have a complete capture of all I want, need or may do and I then use it to add to the triple task list when it has only one item left and this has been very effective.  That said, I am a firm believer in people having something that works for their individual needs.<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">@ Gerry, do you do any pruning to make sure your capture list has only items that you really do plan on actioning?</div>

<div class="content">Nuntym,<br><br>I'm still experimenting with this, but it's working well enough that I think it will be worth fine-tuning. It starts with AF1.<br><br>If I know a task will have to be re-entered, I enter several steps at once. If I want to work on it five times, I enter "1,2,3,4,5". I'm trying a week's worth at the moment, but that will change as I learn how fast I cycle through my AF list.<br><br>The page has less room for other tasks, so when I reach that page I don't have many choices. That keeps me moving on the project each time I hit that page.<br><br>I've only tried it for a week, but it seems to work. It's especially nice for magazines (which the family reorganizes on me) and blog archives (which I sometimes read out of order). The AF list keeps track of which ones I've read.<br><br>It won't work as well with time-based dismissal systems. The last few steps might be in danger of dismissal before I reach them.</div>

<div class="meta">2010-11-11 22:10</div>
<div class="content">Vegheadjones,<br><br>The formal pruning will be when there is no pages left and I start a new notebook.  Informally, if I see something I don't need or want to do I cross it off when I am looking for new TT items.  I like notebooks or legal pads because by tearing out the triple task page each day and other pages that get filed, you naturally reduce the notebook and use the end of the notebook as a review.  It is a technique I used in my other systems and with a legal pad or 100 sheet notebook the timing works out.  Note, I am using a simple spiral notebook now so it is all in one place, which keeps life simple, the way I like it.<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>Christian G., <br><br>The main  problem with both DWMs in applying 3TS is how the DWMs handle "re-entered" tasks.  In the 3TS system, you are expected to finish ALL items you enter in the system, so "re-entered" tasks can become either redundant or a bit confusing.<br><br>God bless.</div>

<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>Cricket, I'm sorry but I have having trouble understanding your tweak.  Let's taks your example of doing a task five times. So you enter the task in the list five times, like this:<br><br>> Long Task<br>> Long Task<br>> Long Task<br>> Long Task<br>> Long Task<br><br>or do you write "1,2,3,4,5" beside the task, like this:<br><br>> Long Task 1,2,3,4,5<br><br>Then what would happen if you run out of tasks/numbers to cross out after doing them?  And so sorry, but cn you run down how it works again?<br><br>God bless!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Nuntym,<br><br>I'm a storyteller. If I want to rehearse four times this week, I write:<br>> Rehearse 1<br>> Rehearse 2<br>> Rehearse 3<br>> Rehearse 4<br><br>(I'd probably replace many of the "Rehearse" with a squiggle to mean "same word as above.")<br><br>If it's Monday and I see those tasks, I might skip it. If it's Thursday and I still haven't done Rehearse 1, I know I have to catch up.<br><br>Or I'd write:<br>> Rehearse 1,2,3,4<br>And cross off each number rather as I do it. This way it doesn't stand out as much on the page and tends to get buried.<br><br>If I finish all 4 rehearsals, then I'm done for the week and copy it onto the next open page with a note that the group of tasks doesn't become active until Monday. I might do it again before Monday, but that would exceed my goal of 4 and I should use that time on my other goals.<br><br>If I don't finish them all, then I still enter the next batch on the next open page. I then choose what to do about the undone rehearsals.<br><br>If I really need to get in those rehearsals, I might enter 4 for this week and leave the old ones on the list, so I see it twice on my way around. Or I might enter 5 times this week rather than 4, to make up for last week, and mark the old undone ones as "will never do". Or I might admit I'll never catch up, enter 4 for this week and delete the ones I didn't do last week.<br><br>If it's a task with discrete steps but I know I'll leave it too late and try to do too many steps in one sitting I spell them out, one after the other. I also indent all but the project title. When I see the indented block, I know there's a chain that has to be done in order and I have to start work early.<br><br>> Story for November 15<br>>> check theme and length<br>>> pick some candidates and sleep on them<br>>> choose story<br>>> read favourite and check the length. (I like to fix it before learning it.)<br>>> make outline<br>>> learn first half<br>>> learn second half<br>>> rehearse 4 times (treat this line as above)<br><br>I might also add target dates to each step.<br><br>This reminds me that I need to do several sessions. If I manage more than one step per session, great!<br><br>I like to clean one room a day, but it's usually half that speed. I list all of them up front and cross them off as I do them to keep track.<br><br>bathroom, <br>kitchen, <br>front hall, <br>parents', <br>kid1, <br>kid2, <br>bathroom, <br>kitchen, <br>front hall, <br>dining, <br>living, <br>laundry<br><br>Bathroom, kitchen and front hall need more frequent work so they're entered twice. When I finish the cycle, I rewrite it on the next open page. I know if I'm on track from the date I started this cycle and how many rooms are done and if I'm keeping up.<br><br>This works better than writing the rooms on the calendar. It always slips, and I'm stuck erasing and rewriting or working on an old date and trying to catch up. Also, sometimes the rooms are done out of order, such as when a kid can't find something. It's done for that cycle so I mark it done.</div>

<div class="content">Nuntym,<br><br>I don't see your problem with re-entered tasks: I take three tasks from the DWM2 list, write them on a separate piece of paper and mark them as done in the DWM2. When I have finished one of the tasks, I have to think what might be the next action to go on with the project to which this task belongs. If there is any, it will go into the DWM2 list (marked as a follow-up task to be dissmissed in 7 days), if there is no one, then I do not re-enter anything. That does not seem different from the normal way of using DWM.<br><br>Wolfgang</div>

<div class="content">Cricket, what you do sounds fine. For what it's worth, sometimes I would write clean kitchen, bathroom, etc. on a separate page, and write only "clean kitchen --> P clean" on my AF system. When the kitchen is clean, I look up the Clean page and write another thing to clean.</div>

<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>The human mind is so weird sometimes...right after commenting on Mark's new "Super AF1" or (I guess) SAF1 on how similar it is to Alan's system, I remembered Alan's joke about "HDW" to make a system more focused on finishing than DWM.  I then remembered Ilse's post above about the different task markers one can use, and it clicked in my mind...DWM, when it comes to dismissing items, is actually just "WM": you dismiss items at the 7th day mark and the 30th day mark.   So what if we make a TRUE DWM, wherein the system dismisses all at the 1st, 7th, and 30th day marks?<br><br>And heck, it is easy: you can do it both in DWM1 and DWM2 (easier, I think, in DWM2 and electronic DWM1, as the today page in DWM1 is often full).  So you follow all rules of DWM1 or DWM2, except<br><br>1) When you are going to do a task that is not in the last day page/section, cross it out and rewrite at the today page (for DWM1) or at the end of the list with a heavy dot (●) at the beginning (for DWM2; if it is at the last section then just mark a heavy dot (●) at the beginning). (NOTE: I think you can also do this for urgent items you want to do today, like you are planning to do it today, a few moments from now or right after what you are doing now, but I am not sure how it will affect the system).<br>2) When are not finished with the item but have to do something else, do not cross it out but leave it there; you can go back to it anytime.<br>3) When you are finished with the item for today but is either recurring or have follow-up tasks that you can do some other day, then cross it out and write it the 7-days-left page (for DWM1) or put a mark before it (in my case, an open circle, o, for DWM2), to denote a "re-entered" item to be crossed out after 7 days<br>4) All items with the heavy dot (●) are crossed-out the next day.<br><br>So you now have 3 entry points: Today for "To be done, or D, tasks", 7 days from now for "Re-entered, or W tasks," and 30 days from now for "New, or M tasks."<br><br>Now what are the theoretical advantages for this?<br><br>1) It gives increased focus on finishing.<br>2) It gives you a visual representation of how many items are "in the fire" right now.<br>3) It forces you to have a realistic picture of what you are planning to do today.<br>4) It gives a visual representation of what you have accomplished today.<br><br>There are, of course, some disadvantages to this scheme, most importantly the overhead of re-writing and possible anxiety on seeing how many you have to do today.<br><br>Besides, I have not tested this, just thought of it and wanted to put it here.  However I am going to test this now, it looks very promising...at least theoretically ^___^<br><br>God bless.</div>

I originally did not mean "dismiss", I meant deleting unactioned "for action" items, which is what one usually does in DWM.  However, I think dismissing them ala AF1 would be a better idea.  What I mean is dismissing unactioned "for action" items with a highlighter after one day.  This theoretically gives me, as it does in AF1 (I am actually going to quote directly from the AF1 rules), the option to "consider carefully why they were rejected, whether they really need to be done at all, whether the time is ripe for them to be done, whether they distract from your main goals, and any other factors," and then, if needed, re-enter the dismissed items by "breaking them down or re-phrasing them in some way."  This theoretically also gives me the ability to gauge how I have overcommitted myself in choosing my goals for the last few days, as advocated in DIT, by examining the number of highlighted lines in each day and the types of tasks dismissed.<br><br>BUT, I have to check all of these by actual use.<br><br>God bless, and thanks for the ideas, Alan ^__^</div>

<div class="content">Alan:<br><br>I hadn't thought of that. The way I do it is to select a recognizable chunk of text, and copy and paste it into the site's search box. When I've found the post, the URL for the post is in the browser navigation box. It has the same effect as the link you've just exampled.<br><br>To produce a post without the surrounding thread, I do the same but delete everything in the link between post/ and the final number,e.g. <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1306160" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1306160</a></div>
