<div class="content">David Allen:<br><br>"I want to reinforce an important principle to remember: to be successful requires a lot more than just getting organized. It's also about paying attention to the part of ourself that has the wisdom to make the best choice. Sometimes that choice is not to take a physical action at all, but to simply wait and listen. That may be the most challenging practice for many of us to implement."<br><br>(from <a href="http://www.davidco.com/newsletters/archive/0510.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.davidco.com/newsletters/archive/0510.html</a> )<br><br>What I like about Mark's systems that are based on the "standing out" principle is they all take this principle and systematize it -- whereas for GTD it's more of an explanatory footnote.</div>

<div class="content">And on the (old) topic of making money with AF, you could label some cheap notebooks with "Ready for use with Mark Forster's Autofocus system!!"  or  label a diary with  "Perfect for DIT!!" and sell them for $29.95.<br><br>Cf. https://secure.davidco.com/store/catalog/GTD-FILE-FOLDER-BUNDLE-p-16569.php</div>

<div class="content">I agree, there is an action and investment bias in society.  We want to be doing something about "it".  Many times the wisest choice is to do nothing.<br><br>Additionally, to the point about choices and taking action when appropriate is why TM is limited in what it can do for us.  Arranging and re-arranging our tasks in a system does not get them done anymore than arranging our exercise cloths makes us exercise.  Which reminds me of one of Mark's techniques where he advocates putting on the exercise cloths, which usually gets us moving.<br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div>

<div class="content"><What I like about Mark's systems that are based on the "standing out" principle is they all take this principle and systematize it -- whereas for GTD it's more of an explanatory footnote.><br><br>True, but 'standing out' is only part of it, and if the list gets too long...<br><br>Maybe where Marks systems don't work so well is on the 'back end' ie dismissal. It seems much harder to dismiss 'on the fly', so how can dismissal be made as easy as standing out?<br><br>I'm interested to see what Mark comes up with in his latest system.</div>

<div class="content">What makes you guys think "standing out" is governed by "the wise part of ourself"?  smileypete, in a way DWM did make dismissal easy, provided you are willing to abide by it's decision.  I wasn't, but I find AF4's dismissal system is pretty good.  I do already dimiss things on impulse, but when it comes down to clearing that backlog, I see the items there enough times that I'm able to come to grips with dimissal over time.<br><br>To get to dismissing more probably takes searching and finding a truer source of wisdom than the "standing out" gives us.  We need to think harder about what is important and come to grips that most things are NOT important.  If I could get into such a mindset, I think I could switch to sometimes doing AF4 in a made-up dismissal mode:<br><br>- scan each item in the backlog, and if anything strikes me as being unimportant, dismiss it.  Repeat until nothing seems unimportant.<br>- scan the open list scratching unimportant stuff<br>- go back to the closed list and repeat again.<br>- stop when nothing seems unimportant.<br><br>Never tried this, but it would be an interesting exercise, to observe the results.</div>

<div class="content">Alan, I saw your suggestion for a 50 item limit on an AF list in another thread.  I thought something like that could actually be a much better dismissal method than the current ones.<br><br>Basically, remove the oldest task at the top of the list every time a new task is added.<br><br>But what if the task is important?  How about re-writing it at the bottom of the list.<br><br>But if you re-write it, then you have 51 items.  Maybe repeat and delete the next oldest item.  Re-write if necessary.  Go through until finding a task that can be removed.<br><br>Or..  Maybe allow the list to grow?<br><br>Maybe the list starts at only a few items and then grows naturally this way but also has a built in dismissal method for every time a task is added.  The oldest task may or may not be dismissed, but it always gets re-written at the bottom of the list perhaps?<br><br>That might be too much writing/repetition though?</div>

<div class="content">James, how about do like you said, but skip all that rewriting.  You're fooling yourself if you take the oldest task, do nothing on it, and make it your newest task.  Keep tasks where they are, or else do something on them or else drop them.</div>

<div class="content">I agree with Alan to skip re-writing of existing tasks on a list. I think if you have captured a task either do it or dismiss it, don't re-write it. <br><br>I think if we added up all the re-writing time and used it to actually do something we would be much better off in the long run. The more time we spend managing our time i.e. working in our systems, the less time we spend actually doing. As we have discussed, there is a point where the TM system itself actually becomes a source of procrastination as we make it more complex, cumbersome and time consuming. <br><br>I can't see an arbitrary limit on the list being productive, because you need to know the entirety of what you are dealing with. I loose productivity if I have to use memory to identify what needs to be done. Paper does this so efficiently.<br><br>One technique I use is not to dismiss items during the day. During the day I only add items so I don't forget them. I use my mind to identify what has to be done and then at the end of the day, I do a daily review and remove items no longer needing to be done. This keeps me in doing mode during the day and I find I am more productive.<br><br>Good luck <br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div>

<div class="content">I could never work with a limit of 50 items; I typically have 300-500 on my DWM list at any given time.  (which is less than I had with AFx:  almost never less than 1000).<br><br><br>Alan wrote:  <<<What makes you guys think "standing out" is governed by "the wise part of ourself"?>>><br><br>When DWM is working well for me (ie. I feel at the end of the day that it was a day well spent, I made progress on my most important work while escaping burial by the odds & ends), I do feel that the "standing out" process works quite well, it engages intellect & intuition and helps me to focus.  That combination of intellect & intuition, that feeling of being "in the zone", working the details effectively while still seeing the big picture of where it is all going and why, not being overwhelmed or pulled apart but rather feeling calm and energetic -- that seems to be the "wisest part of ourself" that David Allen refers to.  <br><br>And it usually DOES work well for me, unless I am sick.  (Which unfortunately is pretty often).  So I have these phases where I work DWM and feel on top of things, but then get sick, fall behind, get overwhelmed, lose focus, and slowly try to get back on top of things and keep stuff from going over the waterfall that really shouldn't.  And then gradually I start to get back into that "zone" where I am making good decisions and things are clicking along.  And all along the way, I keep trying to reduce my commitments so that the "recovery time" after a setback is shorter and less frustrating, and the time "in the zone" is maximized.   The proportion of time spent "in the DWM zone" vs "overwhelmed and scattered" is still not high enough to make me happy, but it's higher than it was with AF and systematic improvement is more integrally part of the system, since DWM does such a great job of measuring your total workload and warning you when you've taken on too much.</div>

<div class="content">Having just read Mark's "How to Make Your Dreams Come True" I better appreciate the point of letting the wise part choose. In fact, surrendering decisions away from our conscious awareness to whatever it is that lies beyond it is a kind of overcoming the ego's inclinations and is a very spiritual point I believe. This is not something GTD raises but may well be the crucial difference. Other favourites of mine from Abraham-Hicks or Orin/Sanaya Roman stress the same point - if we are the pencil tip writing on the paper then the unconscious is the pencil being moved by an unknown hand. Sorry, went off on one there, but you get the idea.</div>

<div class="content">A neat quote to emphasise my point above which I came across at <a href="http://www.pov-int.com/en_uk/3card_reading" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.pov-int.com/en_uk/3card_reading</a> - "When you ski you don't control the mountain".</div>
