<div class="content">Here's an idea for dealing with tasks that you CAN'T do right now (I mean, you physically can't do it, you are at work and you need to do the task at home; you need to be with a certain person who isn't available; etc.).<br><br>If literally everything on a page is impossible to do when you first come to the page -- not because you are resisting it, but because you really can't do it at the moment -- then choose one item, and move it forward, rewording it or restructuring it to emphasize why you moved it forward.<br><br>For example, let's say the only thing left on your page is "put away laundry", but you're currently at the office.  You don't want to "dismiss" the item, because it really does need to be done, you just CAN'T do it right now.  So, you can move it forward, rephrasing it as "Go home to put away the laundry".   You did take (a very tiny) action, since you thought about it, decided how to rephrase it, and processed the fact that you have a home task that's pressing on you.<br><br>What's nice about this approach is that, if you start finding that you are copying many items forward like this, maybe you'll realize that you need to take a day off to catch up on home tasks.  In this way, Autofocus will automatically prompt you to emphasize one context over another.<br><br>I think I like this more than just drawing a line across the page, and using the top for work, the bottom for personal, as Mark suggested at <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/624652" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/624652</a> .  So, I'll try it and let you know how it goes.</div>

<div class="content">That's a nice idea, Seraphim.<br><br>I would be handy when you have a page that can't be dismissed just because that particular item.  You can just move it forward and dismiss all the remaining items on that page.<br><br></div>
