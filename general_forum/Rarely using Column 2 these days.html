<div class="content">I recently started my second bound notebook to maintain my SuperFocus (v. 3) list, and have found that I seldom use Column 2.  Right now there are six active pages, and only two pages have had any C2 entries so far.  On one of those two pages, there are only two entries.  On the other, only one entry.  In my last notebook, I never filled C2 more than about half way (my notebook has 28 lines to each page). I'm wondering if this rare use of C2 is a good thing, or perhaps an indicator that I'm not using SF optimally.<br><br>What does everyone think?</div>

<div class="content">Ubi:<br><br>You tell us! Is SuperFocus as you are currently using it producing the results you want? <br><br>If it is, then don't invent a problem where there isn't one.<br><br>If it isn't, then where is it falling down, and could C2 help correct this?</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>I think it's working great!  So no worries (as they say in Australia) …</div>

<div class="content">No worries is also used in Canada.  My self-observation shows sometimes I have no column 2, and sometimes 8 active items.  It varies with situation.</div>

<div class="content">I still use Column 2 quite a bit.    Of my pages that have been dismissed, about 80% were dismissed because Column 2 got filled up.   So, ubi, I suppose I am at the other end of the spectrum from you regarding Column 2 usage, but exactly in the same place with SF "producing the results I want".  :-)</div>

<div class="content">I'm a bit like Alan. C2 varies from 1 or 2 (never less than one) to about 8. At this exact moment I have 4 urgent tasks on my current page's C2 and 2 unfinished tasks on the next page's C2.</div>

<div class="content">I'm a small C2-er, too. I'm at a super-low point in my list right now (only 3 open pages) and each of them currently has 2 C2 tasks, only one of which is open.<br><br>I wonder how much of an individual's use of C2 will depend on how fast they cycle through the list? Mark and I are both fast cyclers, which I know makes me less likely to call stuff "urgent" - because chances are that I'll see the last page of my list (even at  its normal length of about 5 open pages) within the next couple of hours. Seraphim, on the other hand, is a slow cycler, and is using C2 more heavily.<br><br>Just a thought. Either way, it seems that SF is working relatively well in both circumstances!</div>

<div class="content">Sarah -- I have 12 items in C2 on my current page, and 4 items in C2 on the next page.    And yes, I am a slow cycler.   So I think your reasoning makes sense!<br><br>Also, Sarah - How do you manage to get items in C2 on every page?   Are you using Mark's previous variation, where you can just leave things in C2 and move on to the next page?</div>

<div class="content">That included done items... just to give an idea of how many things had been entered.  At the time only one task was open.</div>

<div class="content">Ah!    I included only active items in my count.   My completed / deleted tasks in C2 are ...  a lot more.   :-)</div>

<div class="content">I ALWAYS make sure there are at least one, and usually two items in C2. <br><br>My C1 list is very long and I'm currently struggling to cycle more quickly through it. <br>I have a separate 'Today List' which covers some 'urgent' tasks but can be used flexibly.<br><br>My C2 list sometimes reaches 6 or 7 items, which I hate, as it feels oppressive. When my C2 list is cleared, I enjoy the feeling of release, the freedom to choose whatever task I like, and the chance to fly through C1. <br><br>But then out of my large bag of ongoing projects, I'll always pick out one or at maximum two, to go on C2. This slows me down on C1, but very effectively  provides the 'FOCUS' part of SF for me.</div>
