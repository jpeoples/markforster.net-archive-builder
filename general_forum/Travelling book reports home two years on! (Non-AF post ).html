<div class="content">I thought you folks might like to see a BookCrossing*  journal for one of Mark's Books, "How to Make Your Dreams Come True". This book didn't 'do it' for me, but the new keeper loves it!  <a href="http://www.bookcrossing.com/journal/3942264" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookcrossing.com/journal/3942264</a><br><br>By the way, if you're new to Mark's methods of overcoming procrastination, I can highly recommend his other books, "Get Everything Done..." (esp I'll Just Get the File Out/ Working in Bursts/ Rotating Tasks) and of course "Do It Tomorrow" (esp dealing with Backlogs). To me, many of the methods are still relevant even in the context of AF.<br><br>* BookCrossing is the act of leaving a book in a public place for a stranger to find, who then does likewise.</div>

<div class="content">I've been trying to get hold of a copy of this for a while...    Mark,  how can we get this book back in print?  Anything we can do to help?<br><br>Dave</div>

<div class="content">If you live in the UK, you can ask your local public library to obtain ANY book for you if it is still in print or circulation. They charge a minimal fee to cover their admin costs and it takes about 3 weeks in my experience.<br><br>If you live outside the UK, I believe your university library will be able to do the same.<br><br></div>
