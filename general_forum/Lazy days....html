<div class="content">These days, I am simply lazy. My AF list grows, a lot of things are to do, are getting urgent, but I simply can't get myself to act on them. I know all I had to do was to open my AF book and start following the procedure, but... I don't do it. And in the evening, I have the feeling I have wasted the day.<br><br>Does anybody know periods like that? How do you get over them?</div>

<div class="content">I just made a deal with a friend. I have to work at least two hours a day on autofocus.cc, he has to work at least two hours on his thesis. If one of us fails this minimum requirement, he has to pay 10 Euro to the other one. It's an idea we swiped from "Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness" by Richard H. Thaler and Cass R. Sunstein.<br><br>So, if you have someone you can make a similar deal with, that may be enough motivation to get you started. And once you're there, you'll probably keep working. Could be worth a try, at least.</div>

<div class="content">AndreasE - <br><br>I have more of those days than not. Particularly when my tasks involve things I need to do i.e. admin work for my therapy practice, moving, grocery shopping, etc. When I resist doing my hobbies/passions, I have found fear and working alone (I prefer to compose music with a partner) are the major culprits.<br><br>How do I get over them? Any of the following work, sometimes, maybe...<br><br>* personal therapy<br>* accountability hacks <br>* building small habits, over time and with patience see: <a href="http://www.everydaysystems.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.everydaysystems.com/</a><br>* set external dates with REAL consequences <br>* try to do more of what I love, and less of what I think I need to do<br>* exercise<br>* meditate<br>* mix up my working space/environment <br>* read motivational lit<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Andreas, if I'm experiencing tough times like you are having, I first of all set the bar *really* low.  Two hours in one shot is too much for me if I'm in that kind of mood / funk.  Why not put the AF book to the side and give yourself a complete break from it?  I think many people need that from time to time.  That's one of the good things about AF, that you can pick it up again at any time.   <br><br>The trick I used for years and still use is a "task/fun sandwich" - I would pick one larger project or 3 quick urgent projects (best to have the quicker ones) to work on.  Then I would break these down to quite small tasks of about 5 minutes or so and intersperse working on that with fun things (limit of < 5 minutes) you enjoy.  Then gradually increase the work time, you might get absorbed and want to keep working (or having fun), but stop yourself from doing it at first, later you can skip the fun parts.  For example:<br><br>- Work - copy over prior month spreadsheet to August<br>- Fun - check out "Nudge" on Amazon & read product description<br>- Work - update data for new month<br>- Fun - read first 5 customer reviews on Nudge<br>- Work....<br><br>When I used to do this a lot (pre-AF it was the only way I could get myself to clean my house), I would go for about 6 hours operating this way and get about 4 hours of work done and 2 hours of pure lazy, enjoyable things done.  I would sometimes put times beside each of the work + fun pieces to try to get in under a certain time to have the *BIG FUN REWARD* at the end.   One of the other things I would find is that because I was rushing through the work part to be able to get to the fun stuff, is that if I only put in 4 hours of work, it was probably the equivalent to 8 hours of "normal" work time.<br><br>Do you have any real "want to" projects on your list (or not on your list) that you could get excited about and just do the bare minimum on the stuff you have to get done right now?<br></div>

<div class="content">>> The trick I used for years and still use is a "task/fun sandwich"<br><br>I envy people who can work, then play, in that order. How many of us have been able to consciously change our work habits since adolescence? I know, i know, all of you on this board (sarcasm ended). Seriously though, everyone of my friends and family members work in a similar style as they did since adolescence. <br><br>Me? Over the years I've applied a tweak here and there, but mostly operate the way I always have. And if I was a betting man, I'd say Covey. Allen, Sher, etc have done the same. <br><br>However there's one scenario, as stated by Covey, that I agree with. Huge paradigm shifts have the greatest chance to influence change. My experience is that the pain of doing the same ol, same ol' has to far outweigh the pain of doing something different. Which is why proscriptive systems of how people deal with procrastination rarely work for me.</div>

<div class="content">AndreasE,<br><br>I also have days like this, though not as many as I used to, before AF.  If I couldn't decide what to do 'first' I would often end up doing nothing, feel like a failure and then get depressed.  At times like this, doing anything at all is better than doing nothing.<br><br>Like Jacqueline, I believe in 'setting the bar low'. Sometimes I say to myself, if I do three things today, I will have done well.  They can be very simple things - pay some bills, return a phone call, do some reading - nothing earth shattering, but if I get them done, I feel I have kept chaos at bay another day.  <br><br>Using AF, I can give myself permission to do 'just one thing' - whatever stands out on the page.  Sometimes it's an easy item, sometimes a difficult one, but if I get it done - in AF terms - then I let myself feel a sense of achievement.  Okay, I don't actually high-five myself for doing the recycling, but nor do I give myself a hard time about being lazy.<br><br>Or, as Jacqueline says, put the book aside and give yourself a break.  Going off list is a bit like freewheeling on a bike.  The point is, you don't always have to pedal, to keep the wheels keep going round.<br><br>Good luck!<br></div>

<div class="content">Andreas, I've done as acedia does as well, and followed a "just do three things, then call it quits" style of work - it's worked for me too.  I was just assuming that you had some things to do at work that really *had* to get done asap or you'd be in trouble (hence, no "just dismiss them" advice).<br><br>Avrum, isn't AF itself a prescriptive system?  <br><br>I have to disagree - in my own experience - with your post re. how people don't change - maybe this is true for the 99% of the population who don't ever try anything different than what they've always done.  But for anyone that actively works on changing themselves, I think significant change is possible.<br></div>

<div class="content">AndreasE,<br><br>I find when I can't get to anything I "should" that if I do a good cleaning/organizing of my work space it does wonders. This could take 1 hour or a whole day (or two!) depending upon the disarray it had fallen into.  But virtually every time I regroup at this level, I am re-inspired to get to the tasks I had been avoiding. While I do have other tactics that work, this is the most reliable.<br><br>For me a clean desk/worksapce = a clear mind.<br>Simple, but effective.<br><br>Beth</div>

<div class="content">Andreas I think you are experiencing the natural fallow phase after a big harvest (your thesis). Your mind and body need rest and will insist upon it no matter how hard you try to do otherwise. In fact the more you fight it, the longer this phase will last. Give in to it and see if you aren't rearing to go sooner rather than later.</div>

So, I'll rest for now, drink a lot and wait until I'm recovered.<br><br>Actually, I know that relation between an upcoming small illness and "laziness".

<div class="content">Beth,<br><br>I too find that cleaning the desk works wonders.  I have another theory about why it might work, however.  Sometimes it is just a question of getting into the flow of doing something.  I can predict the productivity of my days by the first few minutes.  If I get sucked into something it is possible that I might not recover and get on track until much later ... if at all.  However, if I don't feel up to working, just starting something simple to "get moving" often works wonders.<br><br>This is why the advice has always been to have structure to your day.  People who get up and go to work every day have fewer problems with motivation.  By the time they get to the office, they have been working in the routine for a while and inertia carries them forward, rather than keeps them from starting.  This makes it a bit harder for those of us who must be self-motivating (a bit of a redundancy there ;-)<br><br>I think that this is also, in part, why habits are so powerful.  They get us moving before we have to start thinking about what to do next and, once moving, inertia helps rather than hinders progress.<br><br>I have mentioned before that I like the (now defunct) TV series "The West Wing".  I kind of hate the politics, but the writing was superb.  Since it is fiction, there are some deep contradictions in the character of the President, but one thing I do believe they got right was how an executive remains productive.  The prototypical scene in one episode was in the oval office, after a particularly hard decision the President says: "My wife says I have to be in the residence in five minutes to get ready for dinner ... what's next?"  That is so in keeping with my personal observations of executives ... they just keep moving ... no matter how hard the previous task was ... no matter how short the time available to do the next thing ... there is no inclination to sit back and regroup ... they just keep on moving forward for as long as they are in "go mode" and then they stop.<br><br>I remember the CEO of one company having to deliver a number of personal messages (I forgot why, but it was important that he do it himself for some reason) and while he was walking down the hall from one 3 minute meeting to the next, he had his secretary in tow and was doing other business has he walked.  He never wasted 30 seconds, that I saw.  His job was making decisions and he did so quickly then moved on.  I think that if he stopped to contemplate how well he was doing or think about what was next, he would have lost much of his momentum.<br><br>So, my point is that it is momentum that is important ... getting started then having a framework of habits and practices that keep you moving forward and give you no chance to stop and rest ... and then have to overcome the inertia of starting up again.<br><br>Some here have talked about "Flylady".  (Oh how I really really hate that site, that awful drawing, and the whole tone of it all.)  But as stupid and as OCD as it sounds, her idea of cleaning the sink has merit.  If you don't know ... she makes a religious practice out of cleaning the kitchen sink.  It is really just awful how she goes into it ... almost pornographic ;-)  But the value to it is that it removes one BIG impediment to action.  When you get up and go to the kitchen there is nothing to DO before you can DO something.  That is crucial.  Nothing is in the way of your doing what you really want to do.<br><br>The second really sound practice is that she insists that you get fully dressed in the morning (this is a site basically for housewives) even if you work at home.  She focuses on the importance of presenting an image to yourself of being fully ready to face the day, and that is true, but the real value, IMO, is that it gets you moving in a routine before you start the day.<br><br>The third practice she preaches (and she really DOES preach) is to develop and follow written routines.  In her world, you don't just clean house when you need to -- you do it on schedule and the schedules are short and structured.<br><br>Finally, she advises doing a quick "swipe" of any room you enter and leave.  Basically, if anything is out of order ... put it right ... it takes only seconds but keeps things the way they should be.<br><br>Far be it from me to "sell" that awful website, but the practices are sound and apply to life across the board, IMO.  It is all about inertia ... it either keeps you from moving or keeps you moving ... your choice.<br><br>Your original question (which I started to address, oh, so long ago ;-) was about how to open the book and get started.  I guess the old Nike slogan is what I'd fall back on ... "Just do it."  But with the twist of: "Just do it first thing in the morning before your eyes are even fully open.  Set out a "track" to follow from your feet hitting the floor to your desk (or wherever you work).  If you have coffee in the morning, open your book and start working it AS you are making coffee and then keep moving ... don't sit down to drink it unless it is at your desk as you are working.  I'd make a "micro workstation" right at the coffee maker.  Just twelve inches square to set down your notebook and start working on it, planning your day, standing there as the coffee maker snorts and spits out your coffee ... then pick up the cup, grab the book, and start DOING the first thing.  Allow not a second to elapse where you can even thinking about sitting down to "gather your thoughts".  That way lies madness ;-) <br><br>Another thing I use to great advantage is the short timed task session.  I use 20 minutes, but 15, 10, or almost anything will work so long as you view it is "quick".  Set your timer and start moving on something that is quick.  Then reset the timer at the end and do it again.  When the timer starts to annoy you because you are "busy", it has accomplished the goal ;-)<br><br>I hope some of those ideas point you in the direction you want to go.</div>

But for anyone that actively works on changing themselves, I think significant change is possible.  <<<<br><br>I have to agree with Avrum on this one (horrors ;-)  Change is certainly possible, but paradigm shift is mostly what makes it stick.  From personal observation, the two most accurate indicators of the success of a person who says they want to change are:<br><br>- "Projected intelligence", and<br>- Deeply felt urgency.<br><br>I don't have any really spiffy labels for it but those capture the sense if it.  If a person walks in and is mentally very active, understands his problem, had theories about why he is the way he is, and is excited about changing ... most likely the change will NOT be effective, in the long run.  That is counter intuitive, I know, but it reflects my experience.  Change is not about intellectualizing and rationally understanding things ... it comes from a deeply felt NEED to change ... which basically reflects a personal paradigm shift (usually from a life changing experience of some kind).<br><br>The person who I would bet on, every time, is the little old lady who had never read a book, who has just lost her husband of 35 years to lung cancer and is shaken and wants to stop smoking because she is terrified of dying that horrible way.  She will succeed.  She does not know or care about the inner workings of the human mind, she is just motivated by primal fear and will follow instructions without thought or question.  (In many cases, you never see these people, they just change spontaneously with no help or advice at all.)<br><br>What about the rest of us?  It is more of a struggle, IMO.  We need to understand and debate and test and tweak and discuss.  We can change ... slowly ... with effort.  But nothing beats being nearly struck by lighting to get one reordering priorities in a deep, lasting, and meaningful way.<br><br>I remember talking with a person once who had made significant changes in her life.  One day she hit the same problem she had some time ago, and had worked her way out of.  I asked her why she was not doing what she already knew she had to do and had proven to herself worked.  She looked blankly and shrugged.  She might have said something like "I forgot".  Who knows?  But it is entirely in keeping with my experience.<br><br>There is also a third factor to this that I don't yet understand fully yet.  I mean, I get it on a gut level, but I don't understand the parameters.  It is that those who are successful in changing somehow "move on".  IOW, they put the problem into their past and move on to other things.  If a person was really successful in beating obesity, for example, a year or two later they would be living a different LIFE.  They would not, in any personal sense, "remember" that they had a problem in the past.  Those who fail to change, even if they seem to have changed, carry their "old" selves with them into the future and that problem state seems to remain, just waiting for times of "stress" as Avrum put it.<br><br>As a practical matter, for us here, the implication is that so long as a person remains in the community of AutoFocus users, he will struggle with time management issues.  If those are solved in a permanent way, he will disappear from this list because he will have moved on to other things.  Yeah, depressing, I know.  This is a fun community!</div>

<div class="content">>> Avrum, isn't AF itself a prescriptive system?<br><br>Yes. Perhaps that's why 2 min later people are hacking the system to pieces.<<<br><br>People are hacking the system because it's flexible.  Because it can be customized to fit almost any person's situation, workload, if you're a "dumper" or have your priorities figured out, the amount of available time - even if you're not feeling well.  That's a positive, not a negative.  At the core, if the basic principles of dismissal and standing out are followed, you're doing some variation of AF.  Do you follow the spirit or the letter of the law?  I think it doesn't matter, as long as you're getting done what's important to you to be done.  I'm happy for anyone who's getting done what they want to get done, and I don't really care how they're doing it.<br><br>Six months ago, I asked Mark if it would be okay if I "hopped around the list following impulses to do things."  His answer at the time was that he would advise against it, but to see how it worked for me.  At the time, it was the right advice - given how my list was structured as a dumping ground of too many projects (but it sure made me productive!)  Then, a few months later AF2 comes out where you hop around the list following impulses to do things - hmmm.  But given my streamlined list today, AF2 is a great tool to use.<br><br>So I don't know, but it seems to me that at the core, AF operates best as a set of principles (general idea) more than a set of rules (specific application of those ideas).  To fundamentalists and people that have low tolerance for ambiguity, that's probably anathema.  <br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacq<br>BRAVO!  Although I'm not an AF'er, I concur with the principles of independent thinking you alluded to in your post.  The onus on each of us is to discover and develop our own prescriptive means of living and directing our own life trajectory and to thrive while doing so.<br>If ambiguity in this vein implies the freedom to decide for ourselves, then I'll choose ambiguity!  <br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Mike, why people change happens to be my area of expertise. I doubt I can claim any other areas, but since my doctoral research was on this very subject, I thought I would chime in. ;-) I think what you are really discussing is the stages of change. If one is in the precontemplation stage, change is very unlikely to occur. If you really have no reason to change but perhaps you are on this board because you like the social nature of it, you'll be in as much trouble productivity wise as always. <br><br>If, however, something happens or you learn something (paradigm shift), you can move to the next stage of change: contemplation. At this point you are motivated to change and begin exploring means for change. Let me use a non-productivity example. My pastor shared this Sunday that he was always one to speed through yellow (or even pink) traffic lights. A patrolman pulled him over one day for doing just that. He asked him for his license and registration then angrily demanded that he get out of the car. Once he did, the patrolman said, "You have a beautiful family." My pastor was confused. Then the patrolman said, "I often see families like yours hurt or killed because their parents do something stupid like speed through a light like you just did." He shoved the cards into my pastor's chest and told him to change his ways. You won't be surprised to learn that my pastor experienced a major paradigm shift and never repeated his speeding habit.<br><br>Those who contemplate may then continue into the Action phase of change. One thing more recent research has shown is that many people do not make this shift from contemplation to action because they get so many rewards simply from contemplating. In other words, we feel better about our weight problem simply by considering going to the gym or checking out weight loss programs. It's as if the appetizer of contemplation satiates our appetite. Those who want more will actually do the work of change. They'll work out, eat differently, join a support group, etc. <br><br>Successful change will not continue unless the person is able to move to the final stage of Maintenance. I think many of us struggle with this stage. We know we need to change, we think about how to change, we make the change, but then find that the dailiness of it wears on us. Truth be told I feel depressed thinking about having no more time management approaches to explore. I enjoy playing with software, reading about productivity, talking about it on this forum, etc. Because I do, in many ways, I cycle through these stages of change. There are times when I am not being productive and I really don't care! I'm in Precontemplation. Then I start thinking that I really need to do something. I start reading a new book or website. Then I take action and put what I've learned into practice. Once I hit Maintenance, I often develop a problem again.<br><br>Understand that Prochaska and colleagues who developed the Stages of Change model have CHANGED it. Imagine that. LOL! See they get bored with Maintenance, too. ;-) IMO, they have made it more complex. I'm sure that complexity is more descriptive, but I do not think it as useful as the 4-stage model is. Given what I know about myself from the Stages of Change, I feel I need to find another way to add excitement to my life. It's like asking someone who's only real pleasure in life is smoking to give up cigarettes. I need to learn to get my kicks out of something other than the new shiny productivity stuff (Thanks, Jacqueline). <br><br>Mike, I really had to laugh at your description of the FLYLady website considering that I wrote an article on her for Woman's Day and have traveled around speaking about her approach. At one point I considered her a friend. (Nothing bad happened; just lost touch) I have a blurb on the back of her book. That being said, I can see where the whole thing would rub your personality completely the wrong way. LOL I no longer use her exact approach or keep up with her site, but things I learned from it will always benefit me (routines/habits, caring for your appearance daily, etc.).<br><br>Avrum and Jacqueline, I agree with you both.</div>

I was more thinking about the personality types who seem to be mostly ready for change.  The "analyst" has to climb a steeper hill to get there, it seems.  What is a benefit in most other contexts seems to get in the way when it comes to change.  The analysist seems to focus more on "why", than "how".

Or at least the kind of "shift" I mean.<br><br>>>> you can move to the next stage of change: contemplation.

They have not undergone the "shift" yet.  Perhaps I need to study your terminology to better communicate but in my experience, just being "wanting to change" is not nearly close enough.  Lots of people are in real pain and want to change but are not yet sufficiently motivated because they have not changed their viewpoint about themsleves.  The motivation must be based on a fundamental shift in world view, in my experience.<br><br>>>> Let me use a non-productivity example. My pastor shared this Sunday that he was always one to speed through yellow (or even pink) traffic lights. A patrolman pulled him over one day for doing just that.

He shoved the cards into my pastor's chest and told him to change his ways. You won't be surprised to learn that my pastor experienced a major paradigm shift and never repeated his speeding habit.  <<<<br><br>See,now that is what I call a "shift".  It was like a smack across the face.  He had never thought about his "simple" rushing through a changing light as important in any significant way.  He was then hit, with the awful potential consequences and he was not prepared AT ALL to hear that ... so it shook him to his toes.  It was probably due to a combination of his personality, his underlying sense of responsibility, and the art of the police officer in delivering the "blow" in such a way as to make it stick.  I can well see another person being unphased by it and just feeling relieved to have not gotten the ticket.  Also, if you think about it, "change your ways" is code for a member of the clergy ... more than for others of us.  It was a perfect moment for a powerful lesson to cause lasting change.  And, I suspect that the change was wider than that.  I'll be willing to be that he is now more sensitive to lapses of judgement and responsibility in other areas of his life as well.<br><br>And, notice that he did not go through all of these "phases" of change.  He did not want to change.  He had not even thought about it.  And the change was instantaneous ... it took no further education or preparation or thought or action after that.  He just ... CHANGED!  One moment he was rushing ... from then on, he was moving more responsibly.  I know that if I catch myself speeding, especially on long trips when we easily habituate to the higher speeds on the highways, the only way I can slow down is to change my inner focus.  I have to "relax" and shift from the destination to the journey, as it were.<br><br>>>>  Those who contemplate may then continue into the Action phase of change. One thing more recent research has shown is that many people do not make this shift from contemplation to action because they get so many rewards simply from contemplating. In other words, we feel better about our weight problem simply by considering going to the gym or checking out weight loss programs. It's as if the appetizer of contemplation satiates our appetite. Those who want more will actually do the work of change. They'll work out, eat differently, join a support group, etc.  <<<<br><br>That makes a whole lot of sense to me.  This is what makes some of us "time managment junkies", for example.  It is just fun!<br><br>>>>  Successful change will not continue unless the person is able to move to the final stage of Maintenance. I think many of us struggle with this stage. We know we need to change, we think about how to change, we make the change, but then find that the dailiness of it wears on us.  <<<<br><br>I suppose that is where the 21 day period for a habit to take comes from.  One has to stick with it long enough for a change to habituate (into the subconscious) and get past the point where we have to keep making the conscious decision to keep on going.  So long as we have to choose to act differently we risk not doing it.<br><br>I also hypothesize that this is as much a "feature" as a "problem".  IOW, it is GOOD that change is hard ... stability is an important feature of human nature.  If we could easily change, then we could just as easily change back.  Inertia is an important feature ... neither good nor bad.  We just need to recognize how it operates and use it to our advantage.<br><br>>>> Truth be told I feel depressed thinking about having no more time management approaches to explore. I enjoy playing with software, reading about productivity, talking about it on this forum, etc. Because I do, in many ways, I cycle through these stages of change. There are times when I am not being productive and I really don't care! I'm in Precontemplation. Then I start thinking that I really need to do something. I start reading a new book or website. Then I take action and put what I've learned into practice. Once I hit Maintenance, I often develop a problem again.   <<<<br><br>I wonder if you might find a way to reframe your interest.  You don't actually have to BE unproductive in order to study that state, do you?  Would it be effective to make the study of time management part of your interests in a way that did not involve you experimenting with your actual personal system?  Just a thought.<br><br>>>> Understand that Prochaska and colleagues who developed the Stages of Change model have CHANGED it. Imagine that. LOL! See they get bored with Maintenance, too. ;-) <<<<br><br>LOL ;-)<br><br>>>>  IMO, they have made it more complex. I'm sure that complexity is more descriptive, but I do not think it as useful as the 4-stage model is. Given what I know about myself from the Stages of Change, I feel I need to find another way to add excitement to my life. It's like asking someone who's only real pleasure in life is smoking to give up cigarettes. I need to learn to get my kicks out of something other than the new shiny productivity stuff (Thanks, Jacqueline). <<<<br><br>Well, that is how I came up with that previous question.  I think you could have a lot of fun cataloging, studying, and writing about productivity without being unproductive.  One reason I was initially attracted to AF was that it was brain dead simple.  No hardware or software needed.  I was worn to a frazzle with the endless search for the perfect Plam program that would interface with Outlook and email and a calendar and ...  I still am drawn to an electronic implementation, from time to time ... but since nothing works well, why not just stay with paper?  At least that is what I feel right now.  But I'm kind of a computer geek and lately I've been sucked into Visual Basic programming so as to write a spiffy macro to do stats in Excel.  ROTF ;-)  But I'm getting better at realizing what is a side track.  I simply put "Develop Visual Basic Macro" on my project list and then prioritize it in my weekly review session.  It is hard to justify taking the time to fool with programming when I've got this big garage project to get done and even bigger projects depending on that getting done.<br><br>>>>  Mike, I really had to laugh at your description of the FLYLady website considering that I wrote an article on her for Woman's Day and have traveled around speaking about her approach. At one point I considered her a friend. (Nothing bad happened; just lost touch) I have a blurb on the back of her book. That being said, I can see where the whole thing would rub your personality completely the wrong way. LOL  <<<<br><br>You can visualize my reaction to that fat cartoon fly lady in purple with wings.  GAK!  It is so patronizing.  But I do consider the audience.  I'm just not a woo-woo kind of guy ;-)  I'm not doing a "blessing", I'm cleaning the friken house!!!!  LOL ;-)    And, as I said, her advice is impecable.<br><br>>>> I no longer use her exact approach or keep up with her site, but things I learned from it will always benefit me (routines/habits, caring for your appearance daily, etc.).<br><br>Yes, one cannot argue with any of that ... across the board.  I'm still using the 3x5 colored card system from those Sidetracked Ladies.  That had a lot of woo-woo associated with it but I got past it ;-) ;-)<br><br>If you have any links or references to share on the topic of change, I'd be very much interested.  I'm always on the lookout for that kind of thing.</div>

<div class="content">While I have not had formal education or study regarding how we change, I have had a ton of personal experience with this. Over the last several decades I have changed some very ingrained habits, such as quitting smoking, alcohol, “recreational” speed (way back before the current trends—long story) and coffee (I Loved coffee). And now I am changing my eating habits in some very fundamental ways—something I have been working on for years. None of these were easy, not by a long shot. And all of them have to do with habits, routines, priorities and time, and my relationship to them.<br><br>Perhaps one of the most important aspects of these, for me at least, is that none of these “habits” kept me from being responsible and taking care of business. This is a grey area of addiction, imo, as everything appears “a-ok”. They did, however, keep me from moving forward into that place that Mike refers to in the above post (Factor #3). <br><br>This is a huge subject, personally and otherwise, but I do want to share a couple things that I have realized, and experienced, about true, lasting change. <br><br>When I quite smoking, the first time was in 1979. After five years of not smoking, I figured I could now handle having “just one”. After six months of this approach, I was smoking full time again (about 2 packs a day!). A few years later I quite again, this time with success—I just had my 20 year anniversary. Here is what I got, which I have discussed with many other smokers and ex-smokers alike:<br><br>There are four identities I held wrt smoking (which I feel can apply to any addiction, or any habit one is trying to change).<br>	Stage one:	I was a smoker who smoked—wasn’t even on my radar to quit—just wasn’t ready at any level. I thought it was cool, that I needed it, etc. <br>	Stage two: I was a smoker who didn’t smoke—this is where I was while I didn’t smoke (for those 5 years), I craved it and thought about it all the time. I was still smoking in my mind.<br>	Stage three: I was not a smoker who still smoked—I hung out here for a year or so before I finally did quit. At this point, I now hated smoking, wanted to be rid of it yet still had the physical habit. This was perhaps the most excruciating and conflicting stage of all.<br>	Stage four: I was (am) a non-smoker who doesn’t smoke. I have ended the struggle with smoking and don’t consider myself a smoker at any level and the battle with this has ceased.<br><br>As for the other addictions I have dealt with (coffee, wine and speed—a story in itself) basically the above stages or identities apply. As to how I actually stopped is a lot about changing how, or who, I identified within. Yet, I wonder if that shift of who I identify with actually takes place until Stage Three, when I no longer see myself within as that person who smokes (or who is overweight, or uses drugs, etc.) And this is where, in my experience, I had to utilize several techniques to get to the next stage, such as:<br>-I had to believe I would be there someday<br>-Awareness, education, etc.<br>-Desire to change, evolve, grow at any cost<br>-Timing<br>-Creating habits (also as Mike addresses above) that support the new behavior<br>-Resolve, getting the value of persistence, and just doing it<br>-The spiritual lessons associated with all this (a key element for me)<br><br>But just recently, like this week, I got another important insight into this whole thing of change. As I mentioned above, I am now in the process of changing what has been perhaps the greatest challenge for me~my eating patterns and habits. While smoking or drinking is a “I either do or don’t” thing, one still has to eat. Yet I knew there had to be a link to the other things I had stopped doing in my life. <br><br>And this is what I got: I have ceased negotiating with food, which I also did with drugs, cigarettes, wine, etc. “I will only have a half pack today.” “I will not have any wine all week, then it will be ok if I do on the weekend.” “I will quit using speed when I run out this time.” And with food “Friday is a pot luck, I will stop after that.” (I have developed MANY clever ways of negotiating with food ;~)<br><br> And now that I see that, I am clear(er) about how this relationship to food has to cease. No more of it talking me into this or that. I have a plan, I am on that plan, I am not deviating unless I have the total consent of all parts of me. Resolve prevails. No more negotiating. <br><br>Ok, what does all this have to do with AF, or any time management system for that matter? Well, in my case, tons. For a very simple, even obvious, reason. What an incredible waste of time I have spent on traversing those things. I mean really, hours and days and weeks of my life I have spent learning about, struggling against, trying some new way to change, and most definitely, negotiating with. What a waste of my precious time on this Earth. And no time management system around is going to work if I am still seeing myself in a way that supports/allows behaviors that waste my precious time. It is like using a band-aide for a deep wound.<br><br>Am I done yet? Well, no. But I am far removed from this kind of time wasting as in years and decades past. And now that I feel I am on the right path and in right relationship with food, the last hold out, I am seeing my productivity levels sore. My mind is clear, my goals feel viable, my path is straight(er). But man, what a struggle. I must say I have always envied those who don’t have these issues of addiction…but I also know we all have our challenges, don’t we.<br><br>Why I chose to share all this here, I have no idea. But I hope you all don’t mind. It just felt ok to do so.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">>>> I was more thinking about the personality types who seem to be mostly ready for change. The "analyst" has to climb a steeper hill to get there, it seems. The analysist seems to focus more on "why", than "how". I can tell you how hard it is for me, personally, to change ... I'm always fighting my analytic personality. Grrrrr ;-(>>><br><br>Mike, that's another way to slice up this pie and it's just as legitimate. I'm not much of a "how" person unless there is a risk of social disapproval for not following the rules.<br><br>>>> That is why I am here at this point. It is a friendly community and I pick up good ideas because of the generally high level of intelectualality here ;-) Just two days ago I learned about Daniel Kahneman, thanks to Jacqueline.<<<<br><br>That's why I'm here, too. I am actually learning a lot about many subjects and I think for me it's the immediate feedback that's rewarding. I can write a blog post or an article and wait for positive feedback for quite a while. Here I can get a response very quickly.<br><br>>>>I'm not sure I would call "learning something" a "paradeigm shift.>>> <br><br>No, I agree with you. What I was trying to say is that sometimes learning something (e.g., that a high-carb diet can lead to digestive disorders) can move you to the Contemplation stage. This will not necessarily be a "paradigm shift" that has the capacity to move you immediately to Action. <br><br>>>> see people all the time who are looking for ways to change but are not really ready to change. They have not undergone the "shift" yet. Perhaps I need to study your terminology to better communicate but in my experience, just being "wanting to change" is not nearly close enough.>>> <br><br>Mike, you've grasped the whole concept of Stages of Change. This conceptualization of some people being "ready" to change while others are not has been used to accurately predict smoking cessation and diet success. I applied it to anxiety patients about to participate in a drug trial and found that a patient's stage of change was a better predictor of therapeutic outcome than whether or not the patient was on drug or placebo. It's a powerful construct. Here's a link to the pop psych book based on the original research: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Changing-Good-Revolutionary-Overcoming-Positively/dp/038072572X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1250714391&sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Changing-Good-Revolutionary-Overcoming-Positively/dp/038072572X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1250714391&sr=8-1</a><br><br><<<See,now that is what I call a "shift". And, notice that he did not go through all of these "phases" of change.>>><br><br>I knew you would say that, Mike. ;-) Yes, we human beings can never be pigeon holed completely, can we? Yet sometimes we are moving through these stages silently. Perhaps my pastor had previously considered his yellow light behavior and felt it wasn't good. The patrolmen's words were the match that lit the fire under him. However, I do not deny that there are circumstances powerful enough to effect change in and of themselves.<br><br>>>>That makes a whole lot of sense to me. This is what makes some of us "time managment junkies", for example. It is just fun!>>><br><br>Yes, but allowing Contemplation to demotivate your Action phase is something we all need to be aware of. I think this is why it's important to quite before you sick of something like writing. I have seen this in myself with regard to homeschooling. What I REALLY love is researching curriculum and contemplating the teaching of new subjects. The actual teaching can get old. If I were smart, I wouldn't spend all summer making grand plans and would instead start new things throughout the school year to keep my interest high.<br><br>>>>I suppose that is where the 21 day period for a habit to take comes from. One has to stick with it long enough for a change to habituate (into the subconscious) and get past the point where we have to keep making the conscious decision to keep on going. So long as we have to choose to act differently we risk not doing it.>>><br><br>True, but I think the 21 day thing is completely arbitrary. As Beth said above (I will respond to her shortly), it's entirely possible to have changed even for years and then find oneself reverting to old bad habits. Perhaps for some personalities, habit plus variety/excitement are required to maintain change.<br><br>>>>I also hypothesize that this is as much a "feature" as a "problem". IOW, it is GOOD that change is hard ... stability is an important feature of human nature. If we could easily change, then we could just as easily change back. Inertia is an important feature ... neither good nor bad. We just need to recognize how it operates and use it to our advantage.<<<<br><br>That is a very astute observation. I have never thought of it that way! I am certainly thankful that my husband doesn't jump on every bandwagon I run by him. LOL<br><br>>>>I wonder if you might find a way to reframe your interest. You don't actually have to BE unproductive in order to study that state, do you? Would it be effective to make the study of time management part of your interests in a way that did not involve you experimenting with your actual personal system?>>><br><br>This is also very helpful for me. I think I have been embarrassed by my passion for the subject. People often tease me about it and I recognize that it is kind of silly to invest so much time into the study of time management rather than just doing. On the other hand, everyone I know who is really good at something invests time in the minutiae of their interest. Tennis players read reviews of racquets and discuss court qualities. Homeschoolers talk endlessly of curriculum. It might be okay if I do that with respect to time management, especially if I think of myself of a time management writer. Of course, there's also this issue of feeling like a hypocrite writing about TM when I don't feel entirely successful at it myself. ;-)<br><br>>>>But I'm getting better at realizing what is a side track. I simply put "Develop Visual Basic Macro" on my project list and then prioritize it in my weekly review session. It is hard to justify taking the time to fool with programming when I've got this big garage project to get done and even bigger projects depending on that getting done.>>><br><br>I'm sure you are getting better at it. AF is a big help in this area. I think I don't give myself enough credit for the progress I've made on not chasing rabbits.<br><br>>>>You can visualize my reaction to that fat cartoon fly lady in purple with wings. GAK! >>><br><br>Yes, I can. That's why I found it so humorous!!<br><br>>>>Yes, one cannot argue with any of that ... across the board.

That had a lot of woo-woo associated with it but I got past it ;-) ;-)>>><br><br>It's so funny how you react to the woo-woo and I react to what I perceive as anal-retentive stuff.

They did, however, keep me from moving forward into that place that Mike refers to in the above post (Factor #3).  <<<<br><br>If I could share a point of view with you ... You started by calling these things "habits" and ended by calling them "addictions".  I prefer the first term over the second.  If one is truly addicted, the body will shut down if one withdraws.  This is not true of smoking and  eating, for example.  The psychological reason to avoid thinking of these things as addictions is that it tends to remove responsibility from the equation.  "I can't help myself, I'm addicted."  These are truly difficult habits to change, to be sure, but habits they are and they respond in ways similar to other habits.<br><br>>>>  When I quite smoking, the first time was in 1979. After five years of not smoking, I figured I could now handle having “just one”. After six months of this approach, I was smoking full time again (about 2 packs a day!).  <<<<br><br>I usually look at it this way ... you quit smoking and then "decided" to become a smoker again.  This puts the proper spin on it, I think.  It is not as if this powerful force took you over in the middle of the night while you were sleeping ;-)  You thought about  it, bought the smokes, opened the pack, put the damn thing in your face and set it on fire!  This was a deliberate choice.  You were not out of control, you were in perfect control and simply chose to smoke, for reasons of your own.  THEREFORE, you can choose to stop doing that if you decide to.  That is a much more enabling way of framing the situation and this is all about frames of mind.<br><br>>>>  A few years later I quite again, this time with success—I just had my 20 year anniversary. Here is what I got, which I have discussed with many other smokers and ex-smokers alike:<br><br>There are four identities I held wrt smoking (which I feel can apply to any addiction, or any habit one is trying to change).<br>Stage one:	I was a smoker who smoked—wasn’t even on my radar to quit—just wasn’t ready at any level.

The last stage is complete habituation of the new skill.<br><br>>>>  As for the other addictions I have dealt with (coffee, wine and speed—a story in itself) basically the above stages or identities apply.  <<<<br><br>Yes, I think it is a fairly broad view of learning.  I am somewhat fortunate in that my personality values control above all ... I am scared silly of being out of controls so I will never do anything that would take me there.  If I find I am stopping to get a donut with my coffee in the morning I STOP.  I can't let things take me over.  But it does have some downsides ;-)<br><br>>>>  As to how I actually stopped is a lot about changing how, or who, I identified within. Yet, I wonder if that shift of who I identify with actually takes place until Stage Three, when I no longer see myself within as that person who smokes (or who is overweight, or uses drugs, etc.) And this is where, in my experience, I had to utilize several techniques to get to the next stage, such as:<br><br>-I had to believe I would be there someday<br>-Awareness, education, etc.<br>-Desire to change, evolve, grow at any cost<br>-Timing<br>-Creating habits (also as Mike addresses above) that support the new behavior<br>-Resolve, getting the value of persistence, and just doing it<br>-The spiritual lessons associated with all this (a key element for me)  <<<<br><br>Another take on this is ... in order to generate real motivation one must feel responsible to take action and in order to do that these three (at least) feelings must be in place:<br><br>- It needs to be done (or why bother?)<br>- It is mine to do (or why not let someone else step up?), and<br>- I Can do it (or what is the point?)<br><br>>>>  But just recently, like this week, I got another important insight into this whole thing of change. As I mentioned above, I am now in the process of changing what has been perhaps the greatest challenge for me~my eating patterns and habits. While smoking or drinking is a “I either do or don’t” thing, one still has to eat. Yet I knew there had to be a link to the other things I had stopped doing in my life.  <<<<br><br>Yes.  People don't often make that identification.  Eating is its own special thing.  It is a question of changning your reference when you evaluate the circumstances before you take action.  IOW, people who have trouble with eating are not referencing food, so much as other things when they are making eating decisions.  Things such as:<br><br>- Feeling good<br>- Releiving stress<br>- etc.<br><br>There is a whole lot more to it, but one thing that a person must do is learn to see food as food, and not all of those other things. <br><br>>>>  And this is what I got: I have ceased negotiating with food, which I also did with drugs, cigarettes, wine, etc. “I will only have a half pack today.” “I will not have any wine all week, then it will be ok if I do on the weekend.” “I will quit using speed when I run out this time.” And with food “Friday is a pot luck, I will stop after that.” (I have developed MANY clever ways of negotiating with food ;~)  <<<<br><br>LOL ;-)<br><br>>>>  And now that I see that, I am clear(er) about how this relationship to food has to cease. No more of it talking me into this or that. I have a plan, I am on that plan, I am not deviating unless I have the total consent of all parts of me. Resolve prevails. No more negotiating. <<<<br><br>There has been some interesting modeling done regarding how naturally thin people make food choices.  Of course, some people are thin because of metabolism, my ex- was that way.  She would order two complete Italian meals yet weighed only 90 some pounds.  (Her doctor was furious with her low weight. ;-)  But other than that, people who are naturally thin make food choices differently than those who have some problems with food.  A lot of this has to do with time, oddly enough.  One thing that came out of studies of addictive behavior was that addicts (true addicts) have a very badly distorted sense of time.  They can't see into the future in order to be able to forsee the consequences of thier actions.  They live too much in the moment, actually.  I can tell you from perssonal experience that this is also true of eating behaviors.  When I'm eating at my worst, I have NO sense of how I'll feel in 30 minutes, or tomorrow, let alone how much is a reasonable portion size.  Too much in the moment to judge things correctly.  (Incidentally the platitude "A moment on the lips, a lifetime on the hips." recognizes this very fact.)<br><br>>>>   Ok, what does all this have to do with AF, or any time management system for that matter? Well, in my case, tons. For a very simple, even obvious, reason. What an incredible waste of time I have spent on traversing those things.

And now that I feel I am on the right path and in right relationship with food, the last hold out, I am seeing my productivity levels sore. My mind is clear, my goals feel viable, my path is straight(er). But man, what a struggle. I must say I have always envied those who don’t have these issues of addiction…but I also know we all have our challenges, don’t we.  <<<<br><br>Yeppers!<br><br>>>>  Why I chose to share all this here, I have no idea. But I hope you all don’t mind. It just felt ok to do so.  <<<<br><br>I'm so happy you did.

<div class="content">Beth, personal experience is huge in my book. So glad you shared what you did. I've spent all summer researching diet and health and feel I've earned my honorary dietician's degree. Who knows better about how you change than you?<br><br>You've achieved many things and I share your belief that the spiritual aspect of change is vital. I don't believe I would have broken free from my overeating problem without faith. <br><br>As for your characterization of smokers in process of change, I think it is spot on. I love "The Biggest Loser" because I love the topic of life change and you really get to see the contestants struggle to change their identity. <br><br>Beth, I think you can constantly review your history of major life change to aid you in changing your identity with respect to diet. I'm not one who is gaga for affirmations, but certainly you can believe that you are a person capable of change and that you WILL change your diet successfully. <br><br>I have changed my diet several times. The first time was more of a 12-Steps process. I admitted I was powerless to change and that's when the change occurred. The second time required a different dietary change. I felt like I had no other good options. I knew I was facing steroids, hospitalization, or cancer if I didn't do it. I could not leave my children without a mother. Every time I contemplated eating something that was health damaging, that's what I would think. It wasn't an option for me. So many people I know are honestly just not sick enough to change. I guess I was blessed in that I was.<br><br>If you're familiar with the 12-Steps, then you know about the concept of "raising the bottom." I have seen people die when their drug or alcohol abuse brought them to the literal bottom. But I've also seen people find ways to make their current situation the bottom. My faith has directed me to pray that I would hit bottom sooner rather than later so change could happen and I have seen that prayer answered. <br><br>Keep us posted about how you are doing. I expect you'll succeed and will be able to encourage others.</div>

<div class="content">Mel, you've got the hardest job of anyone on this forum.  I couldn't do it, that's for sure.  Well, I could, but probably kicking and screaming all the way.  And likely literally screaming, just figuratively kicking.  :-)<br><br>Re. paradigm shifts, when I was the age that my oldest son is now, my mother passed away quite suddenly, then one of my sisters was killed by a drunk driver 8 years ago.  I do know that these events really brought home to me that life can be gone in an instant, so we have to make the best of it - and ourselves - while we're here.  <br><br>Every once in awhile, I watch Randy Pausch's last lectures (even though he was a 4 quadrant guy!) to remind myself of what's important and how to live life well - here's one of my favourite passages from one of those lectures:<br><br>"... remember, the brick walls are there for a reason.  The brick walls are not there to keep us out.  The brick walls are there to give us a chance to show how badly we want something.  Because the brick walls are there to stop the people who don't want it badly enough.  They're there to stop the other people."<br><br>And here's the last lecture on "Achieving Your Childhood Dreams":<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo</a><br></div>

<div class="content">Good Morning Mel,<br><br>>>> I was more thinking about the personality types who seem to be mostly ready for change. The "analyst" has to climb a steeper hill to get there, it seems. <br><br>The analyst seems to focus more on "why", than "how". I can tell you how hard it is for me, personally, to change ... I'm always fighting my analytic personality. Grrrrr ;-(>>><br><br>+++  Mike, that's another way to slice up this pie and it's just as legitimate. I'm not much of a "how" person unless there is a risk of social disapproval for not following the rules.  +++<br><br>I meant by "how" that the analyst personality will often ignore the work to be done in favor of intellectual understanding of the problem ... at ever deeper levels, and so never gets around to the actual change work.<br><br>Social Disapproval ... ah, the upside of being a contrarian.  "Son, if they are shooting at you, you must be doing something right!"  LOL ;-)<br><br>>>> That is why I am here at this point. It is a friendly community and I pick up good ideas because of the generally high level of intelectualality here ;-) <br><br>Just two days ago I learned about Daniel Kahneman, thanks to Jacqueline.<<<<br><br>+++  That's why I'm here, too. I am actually learning a lot about many subjects and I think for me it's the immediate feedback that's rewarding. I can write a blog post or an article and wait for positive feedback for quite a while. Here I can get a response very quickly.  +++<br><br>Yes, for me as well.  BTW, is "intelectualality" a word?"  ROTF ;-)<br><br>>>>I'm not sure I would call "learning something" a "paradeigm shift.>>> <br><br>+++  No, I agree with you. What I was trying to say is that sometimes learning something (e.g., that a high-carb diet can lead to digestive disorders) can move you to the Contemplation stage. This will not necessarily be a "paradigm shift" that has the capacity to move you immediately to Action. +++<br><br>Ah, I see.  Yes, that is true.  Once something "makes sense" to me, at a deep level, I will act.  Not necessarily in a life changing way, of course ... I still need to spend forever analyzing it, but beautifully simple ideas really have the power to move me.  Talking about carbs ... when I first heard about Atkins, it was from the critics (who to a man misrepresented his ideas, came to find out).  Being the contrarian I am I thought that since so many people were shooting at him, he just might be on to something.  So I read his actual book ... and found out what HE was saying and it made SOOOO much sense that I immedately went on that diet.  Now I did not stick with it ... I got great results but since I did not have that big slap in the face, I drifted back to my pasta ;-)<br><br>My last physical showed some alarming things about blood pressure and cholesterol and that was my slap in the face.  Even there, I went in the "wrong" direction to correct the problem ... I'm not concentrating on low fat (because of the chloesterol) as the doctor advises, but rather going for low carbs (with the negative of higher fat) so as to get the weight down dramatically.  The trick now is to keep on this path long enough to get to my goal weight while building up the aerobic exercise.  That ought to solve the blood pressure problem and then I can focus on diet from a fat point of view to deal with the chlosterol.  At least that is what it says here in fine print.<br><br>But the point of that tangent was that I've struggled with weight issues anytime I was not very physically active.  When I was running 5 miles a day, I was a stick.  But when I started working in the real world of coffee and donuts ... gak.  But lots of exercise won't do it for me.  All those years of running messed up my knees ... that is just not a viable solution.  It is come to Jesus time with respect to diet and so that has to be my focus of change.  But just getting some bad chlorestorol numbers is not going to be enough.  That is a wake up call, but I all too easily hit the snooze button!<br><br>See, I KNOW about change.  I can TELL and TEACH about change.  Doing it is a horse of another color.  (See comments below about hypocrisy ;-)<br><br>>>> see people all the time who are looking for ways to change but are not really ready to change. They have not undergone the "shift" yet. Perhaps I need to study your terminology to better communicate but in my experience, just being "wanting to change" is not nearly close enough.>>> <br><br>+++  Mike, you've grasped the whole concept of Stages of Change. This conceptualization of some people being "ready" to change while others are not has been used to accurately predict smoking cessation and diet success. I applied it to anxiety patients about to participate in a drug trial and found that a patient's stage of change was a better predictor of therapeutic outcome than whether or not the patient was on drug or placebo. It's a powerful construct. Here's a link to the pop psych book based on the original research: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Changing-Good-Revolutionary-Overcoming-Positively/dp/038072572X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1250714391&sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Changing-Good-Revolutionary-Overcoming-Positively/dp/038072572X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1250714391&sr=8-1</a>  +++<br><br>I'll probably get that book.  I'm for any plan based on research.  And that research not only makes sense, it comports with my experience as well.  My only concern about this kind of thing is the particular experiment performed.  IOW, anxiety is one kind of problem and smoking is another.  A person can simply WILL himself to stop smoking ... many people have.  It is far less easy to WILL oneself out of fears, phobias, anxieties, and that sort of psychological (non behavioral) problem.  They are mostly not amenable to will power.  That does not mean that the idea of "readiness" is not applicable ... just that I'm wary.<br><br><<<See,now that is what I call a "shift". And, notice that he did not go through all of these "phases" of change.>>><br><br>+++  I knew you would say that, Mike. ;-)  +++<br><br>Never one to dissapoint ;-)<br><br>+++  Yes, we human beings can never be pigeon holed completely, can we? Yet sometimes we are moving through these stages silently. Perhaps my pastor had previously considered his yellow light behavior and felt it wasn't good. The patrolmen's words were the match that lit the fire under him. However, I do not deny that there are circumstances powerful enough to effect change in and of themselves.  +++<br><br>It might be interesting to "interview" him to see what the exact parameters were.  But yes, I agree that going only by your brief description leaves questions open.  As to the circumstances being powerful ... I think that is really an individual thing.  Sometimes the smallest thing (to an outside observer) can be life altering to the subject.  One just never knows the personal context a person carries with him.<br><br>>>>That makes a whole lot of sense to me. This is what makes some of us "time managment junkies", for example. It is just fun!>>><br><br>+++  Yes, but allowing Contemplation to demotivate your Action phase is something we all need to be aware of.  +++<br><br>Absolutely.<br><br>+++  I think this is why it's important to quite before you sick of something like writing. I have seen this in myself with regard to homeschooling. What I REALLY love is researching curriculum and contemplating the teaching of new subjects. The actual teaching can get old. If I were smart, I wouldn't spend all summer making grand plans and would instead start new things throughout the school year to keep my interest high.  +++<br><br>I only know you through your posts here, and then as the information rolls out slowly over time.  But that said, it seems that your natural inclination is to research, then present, then move on to the next subject.  In so far as I share some of those inclinations, I find that "teaching" is part of my "learning" process.  IOW, I write these longish expositions primarily as a way of clarifying my own thought process and understanding of things.  I've always known that if I can't clearly present an idea in a forceful way so as to convince someone of its rectitude ... then I simply don't understand it well enough yet.  So for me, the teaching part is just as exciting as the researching part.<br><br>>>>I suppose that is where the 21 day period for a habit to take comes from. One has to stick with it long enough for a change to habituate (into the subconscious) and get past the point where we have to keep making the conscious decision to keep on going. So long as we have to choose to act differently we risk not doing it.>>><br><br>+++  True, but I think the 21 day thing is completely arbitrary.  +++<br><br>For habituation to occur?  Yeah, the number is.  It has to be ... we are all different.  But I think that that FRAME of time is about right.  3-4-6 weeks, whatever.  The essential is that the process be repeated and monitored consciously until it happens automagically and then one can forget about it.<br><br>+++  As Beth said above (I will respond to her shortly), it's entirely possible to have changed even for years and then find oneself reverting to old bad habits. Perhaps for some personalities, habit plus variety/excitement are required to maintain change.  +++<br><br>I'm not prepared to make any sweeping genralities on that subject ;-)  But I would argue that if one "reverts", then the change has not actually occurred.  One thing I commonly see is that the changed state becomes too much in focus.  IOW, to take Beth's smoking example, once you stopped smoking, you are not through.  Simply stopping smoking leaves many people just short of the goal.  If you ask them about it they will say: "I don't smoke any longer."  Bzzzzt, wrong response.  The absolutely ideal response is something like a confused, blank stare.  "Smoke?  Huh?  Oh ... yeah ... I did used to smoke.  How dumb was that? Funny, I forgot.  "<br><br>Once change is complete, the personality is changed so completely that one's sense of identity is compltely seperated from the thing one has changed.  So long as one keeps one's identity as a "smoker" there is danger of reversion.  And there is no fundamental difference between a person being a "smoker" or a "non-smoker".  Both identies include the issue of smoking ... that it is pro or con is less important then that it is there at all.  I, personally, have no concept of "smoking" in my sense of identity.  Why should Beth?  I mean, most people don't define themsleves as "non skydivers" or "not surfers" or "non" lots of things that are not in focus in their own lives.<br><br>And, BTW, you may have noticed that I advised Beth to reframe her reversion as: "I quit smoking and then I decided I wanted to smoke again."  That is a much more useful frame than, "I failed to quit smoking ... again."  Change requires a sense of control and competence ... I advise protecting that at all costs.<br><br>>>>I also hypothesize that this is as much a "feature" as a "problem". IOW, it is GOOD that change is hard ... stability is an important feature of human nature. If we could easily change, then we could just as easily change back. Inertia is an important feature ... neither good nor bad. We just need to recognize how it operates and use it to our advantage.<<<<br><br>+++  That is a very astute observation. I have never thought of it that way! I am certainly thankful that my husband doesn't jump on every bandwagon I run by him. LOL  +++<br><br>And that is another take on it that I'm liking.  Marriage adds stability to our lives in just that way.  Our spouse is different and will not simply jump on every bandwagon ;-)  It is frustrating at the time (read, I could chew nails ;-) but if it is truly important, the spouse will move, if not, perhaps that is a good thing.  Just don't refer to your husband as "ballast"!  ;-)<br><br>>>>I wonder if you might find a way to reframe your interest. You don't actually have to BE unproductive in order to study that state, do you? Would it be effective to make the study of time management part of your interests in a way that did not involve you experimenting with your actual personal system?>>><br><br>+++  This is also very helpful for me. I think I have been embarrassed by my passion for the subject. People often tease me about it and I recognize that it is kind of silly to invest so much time into the study of time management rather than just doing. On the other hand, everyone I know who is really good at something invests time in the minutiae of their interest. Tennis players read reviews of racquets and discuss court qualities. Homeschoolers talk endlessly of curriculum. It might be okay if I do that with respect to time management, especially if I think of myself of a time management writer. Of course, there's also this issue of feeling like a hypocrite writing about TM when I don't feel entirely successful at it myself. ;-)  +++<br><br>See, that is a frame I just don't share.  (And it is not as though I've not been ridiculed my entire life because I felt free to have opinions about everything under the sun ;-)  The whole concept of "you have to be good at doing something to be an expert in understanding it" is nuts.  Oncologists don't have to have cancer in order to treat it.  Astronomers don't have to be astronouts.  Learning and doing are different things entirely.  You need to have reasons for your positions, and facts to support them, but you don't have to actually DO everything yourself.  And even you don't apply this to yourself across the board.  Did you feel as if you were not competent to study anxiety patients because you did not have an anxiety disorder yourself?<br><br>And another thing (another??? ;-) this whole politically correct attitude of "being a certified expert".  What a load of rubbish.  In today's culture one is not allowed to have an opinion about things unless one has a post graduate degree in it.  I think the contrary is true, it is our duty as functional human beings to have opinions about things.  To the extent that we relegate the world of ideas to "experts" we lose control of our world and our lives.  One of the most repugnant bits of terminology is "lay person".  Hell, some of the most distinguished scientists of all time were "lay people".  Ben Franklin was a "lay person".   If we don't take the responsibility to understand our world, we might as well just sit around and pick lice out of each others fur. Grumble, grumble.  ;-)<br><br>And I'd also challenge the statement that you are "not successful at time management".  What does that even mean?  Time management is the skill of managing time ... based on what one has decided to do.  It is not some finite "state" that one can point to ... it is more a life style or way of approaching things.  Some days you do 50 things, other days you do 5 ... sometimes the 5 are more work than the 50.  Sometimes they are more important than 50.  Sometimes the most productive thing to do is sit at the end of the peir and dangle your feet in the water all day.  I think we can get too focused on throughput and not see the value of what it is we are doing.<br><br>I knew a professional performance musician who looked down at my wife because she is a music teacher.  Well, that is all a question of values, no?  Every year, around Christmas vacation, last years seniors return from their first year as music majors to thank her for setting them on that path.  What could be more important than that?  So maybe she does not pick up her bassoon for months on end, because she is "wasting time" writing marching drills or teaching guitar class.  But over a lifetime, how many musicians will she have "launched"?  What is more important, playing a solo in the NOS, or building a generation of new musicains?  What does time management have to say about values?  Not a damn thing!    <br><br>>>>But I'm getting better at realizing what is a side track. I simply put "Develop Visual Basic Macro" on my project list and then prioritize it in my weekly review session. It is hard to justify taking the time to fool with programming when I've got this big garage project to get done and even bigger projects depending on that getting done.>>><br><br>+++  I'm sure you are getting better at it. AF is a big help in this area. I think I don't give myself enough credit for the progress I've made on not chasing rabbits.  +++<br><br>Exactly.  For some of us those rabbits can be viscious creatures.  (Visualize Monty Python here ;-) ;-)<br><br>>>>Yes, one cannot argue with any of that ... across the board. I'm still using the 3x5 colored card system from those Sidetracked Ladies. That had a lot of <br><br>woo-woo associated with it but I got past it ;-) ;-)>>><br><br>+++  It's so funny how you react to the woo-woo and I react to what I perceive as anal-retentive stuff. LOL Some of the Lifehacker stuff has me rolling my eyes.  +++<br><br>My wife calls it BER ... Big Eye Roll ;-)<br><br>Oh trust me, that cracks me up as well.  I mean really, memorializing one's grocery list in a beautifully bound book (only from the politically correct company, of course) of acid free paper written in the gorgeous shade of emerald green ink which flows perfectly from the polished 18k gold nib of a $200 pen and slowly dries on the creamy white paper in a way that .... EEEEEEK, soft porn!!!  To say nothing about OCD!   ;-) <br><br></div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Kathy.<br><br>It turns out that a wide variety of approaches will work for some people under some conditions.  In fact, there is a maximum in the psychotherapy biz: "Any methods will work for some people ... NO method will work for all people."<br><br>I remember a BBC program on curing phobia.  There is a German (who'dutunk?) methodology called "flooding" in which some poor slob with an intense phobia of heights is pushed out on the ledge of a tall building that hangs over space ... and has a glass floor.  He went nuts.  Then when I came down he reported that he thought the therapy was a success.  All the while shaking like a leaf and signaling with his eyes: "Help, get me outta here and away from these mad men!" <br><br>That a methodology works has to be determined by considering for how many people it works, under what conditions, and how long the change lasts, and is it permanent ... IOW, does it stick with no further maintenance?  There is no one single method that works for an overwhelming number of people by those standards.  Some are better ... some are more humane ... but change is not well understood ... at all.</div>

Here is one: <br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2008/7/14/the-procrastination-buster-improved.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2008/7/14/the-procrastination-buster-improved.html</a><br><br>Basically if you have only one task on your list you might find yourself resisting.  If you have many, then there are ones on that list which are relatively easy.  In the long run, as you work that list, the task you originailly felt was too diffficult, will seem relatively easier to do than the alternatives.<br><br>What you observed is one reason why it might not be advisable to keep a seperate "A-Notebook".  However, if you think about it, even among "A" tasks, some will always be relatively easy.  So that is the argument FOR an "A-Notebook".  Don't let yourself even see the "C" tasks ... make all your choices among "A" tasks.<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Kathy,<br><br>One of the key characteristics of most "A" projects (mine anyway), is that the path is usually pretty easy and mundane, but the road is very long.  And there's not much instant gratification along that road.<br><br>It's like following a diet and maintaining your weight loss - you just eat a certain way, every day - for the rest of your life.<br><br>One of the things I've found about tasks that create anxiety is that I've almost always created some story around them of dire things that could happen, a story that isn't true.  I've only had one item on my list back in January that caused me anxiety.  I dismissed it and the world didn't come to an end.  :-)  I may not have any of those tasks because I followed a time management system for a few years (when I was a very fearful person) where I would "eat the frog" first thing every day.  Eventually nothing is a frog.  The only benefit in doing this in a regimented way vs. AF is that maybe you become a little more conscious faster that there's nothing behind that resistance bogeyman to be afraid of.<br><br>Re. clarity and ambiguity, I've realized I have to give myself that time to do research, but it has to be focused research, not just spinning my wheels.  For example, I was spinning my wheels, going from store to store, unable to pick materials when renovating one of my bathrooms until I found a picture that was exactly what I wanted to re-create.  If I had spent some time up-front "wasting time" looking for pictures, I would have been much further ahead.  When I have a complex project at work, I always envision the end state, "the in a perfect world" solution and then break down what has to be done to create that end state.  I don't know why I don't tend to do that outside of work, but I'm working on it. :-)<br><br>As Mike said, "A's" aren't necessarily A's because they're difficult to DO, it's the relative importance compared to the "C-s".  Lots of the things in my C-book are far more difficult to do than those in my A-book.<br></div>

<div class="content">Fascinating conversation. My own circular habit-trail, from the deep forest to the light and inexorably back again, has frustrated and disappointed me for years. A couple of small glimmers of enlightenment have appeared along the way. <br>One has been the teachings of Robert Fritz, well expounded by Bruce Elkin <a href="http://www.bruceelkin.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bruceelkin.com/</a> about focusing on acts of creation rather than problems. <br>The other was an allergy doctor telling me that for the treatment to be successful , I needed to give time for my molecular structure to change. Very roughly speaking, he said the immunological system cycles molecules on an annual pattern, so after three months a quarter of the system is refreshed in response to a new regime, after six months 50 per cent, and after 12 months the body will be fully at ease with the changes.<br>(This may be medically incorrect, but mentally it forms an image I can - and did - work to.)<br>On matters of the body I'm pretty good. I had the fortune to be a sickly child who grew out of it, so I know what it means to be ill and am prepared to go the yards to stay in shape.<br>Mentally, I'm hopeless. I do what needs to be done, and do it well enough to get recognition through peers and awards, but I continually cycle through lazy days of ennui to days of mad activity. I end the lazy days in despair, and the mad days in the quiet calm of someone who has given their all -  but then reward that glow of virtue with a lazy day. I have spent a decade resolving to break the cycle, but I'm still cycling. <br>One important thing has changed, though: between RAF and OmniFocus I have finally found a task management system that resists all attempts to uproot it. Amen for that. I hope the next step in breaking the cycle won't be far away. <br>However, getting off the internet is a major part of the battle. In this respect, this forum doesn't help...<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hey, Mike.<br>Thanks for a very engaging thread.  <br>>>> "Son, if they are shooting at you, you must be doing something right!" LOL ;-)<<<<br>I should have this tattooed on my forehead because I know it’s true!<br><br>>>>Yes, for me as well. BTW, is "intelectualality" a word?" ROTF ;-)>>><br>Despite its multiple awkward syllables, we’ll say yes. LOL<br><br>>>> when I first heard about Atkins, it was from the critics (who to a man misrepresented his ideas, came to find out… My last physical showed some alarming things about blood pressure and cholesterol and that was my slap in the face.>>><br>Mike, your contrarian heart will be happy to hear what I’ve learned this summer. The whole low-fat/low-cholesterol thing is rubbish. A nurse friend of mine recently mentioned to me that the cholesterol recommendations have been adjusted downwards, not because they’re related to longevity, but because it forces people to take the drugs. This really hit a nerve with me because despite my mother’s cholesterol being in the previously normal range, they told her it must be still lower and that it will require a cholesterol-lowering drug that has no generic version. This information fit with what I read in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Unhealthy-Truth-Food-Making-About/dp/0767930711/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1250912027&sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Unhealthy-Truth-Food-Making-About/dp/0767930711/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1250912027&sr=8-1</a> that chilled me to the bone. Although I am not an overly trusting person in many areas (being a psychologist tends to do away with pie-in-the-sky ideas about what people are like), I still clung to the idea that medical research could be trusted—probably because I was an ethical researcher and just assumed most of us were. <br>I was particularly stunned by what I read about cholesterol in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nourishing-Traditions-Challenges-Politically-Dictocrats/dp/0967089735/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1250912185&sr=1-1." rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Nourishing-Traditions-Challenges-Politically-Dictocrats/dp/0967089735/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1250912185&sr=1-1.</a> Sally Fallon argues that cholesterol is not a disease risk factor, but rather a symptom of poor nutrition. Her diet promotes the eating of butter, coconut oil, meats with *gasp* fat and whole, raw dairy. The diet is also lower carb than the SAD diet. My family drinks raw milk and the farmer who delivers it to our house (yes, that’s awesome) told me this week that his 39yo friend had a heart attack. That spooked him into getting a physical. Sure enough, his cholesterol and triglycerides were scary high. His wife put him on a Nourishing Traditions diet. Nine months later after consuming the foods that the “experts” have maligned, his numbers were all well within the low normal range. <br><br>>>>But the point of that tangent was that I've struggled with weight issues anytime I was not very physically active. When I was running 5 miles a day, I was a stick. But when I started working in the real world of coffee and donuts ... gak. But lots of exercise won't do it for me. All those years of running messed up my knees ... >>><br>I have a friend who began running due to his cholesterol level. Running is certainly a way of managing weight and increasing cardiovascular fitness, but my personal opinion is that the trade-off of musculoskeletal damage isn’t a good one. When I ran in high school, I constantly had knee, hip, and neck pain. I don’t believe the human body is designed to withstand that constant impact. I have become a big proponent of lifestyle exercise instead. That being said, I know many who are very much psychologically addicted to running and I don’t feel compelled to try and talk them out of their habit.<br><br>>>>I'll probably get that book. I'm for any plan based on research. And that research not only makes sense, it comports with my experience as well. My only concern about this kind of thing is the particular experiment performed. IOW, anxiety is one kind of problem and smoking is another. >>><br>Mike that book is based on research on people trying to quit smoking and lose weight primarily. They didn’t base their book on my research on anxiety patients. Losing weight is one of the most difficult changes to make so they probably know a lot about making change in general as a result.<br>>>>I only know you through your posts here, and then as the information rolls out slowly over time. But that said, it seems that your natural inclination is to research, then present, then move on to the next subject. In so far as I share some of those inclinations, I find that "teaching" is part of my "learning" process. >>><br>I love to teach as well. I think my biggest problem is believing that once I “discover” something I am obligated to stick with it forever or I was wrong about it in the first place. Does that make sense? I still have people ask me if I clean my kitchen sink constantly a la FLYLady. No, shining my sink in a house with 8 people would be a full-time job. LOL I am just thinking aloud and am wondering if I made a disclaimer in my speaking and writing about the fact that I constantly look for new approaches if that problem would be solved.<br><br>>>>I'm not prepared to make any sweeping genralities on that subject ;-) But I would argue that if one "reverts", then the change has not actually occurred. >>><br>I can’t argue with that.<br>>>>And, BTW, you may have noticed that I advised Beth to reframe her reversion as: "I quit smoking and then I decided I wanted to smoke again." That is a much more useful frame than, "I failed to quit smoking ... again." Change requires a sense of control and competence ... I advise protecting that at all costs.>>><br>I totally agree but often forget to reframe my own statements in this way.<br><br>>>> Did you feel as if you were not competent to study anxiety patients because you did not have an anxiety disorder yourself?And another thing (another??? ;-) this whole politically correct attitude of "being a certified expert". >>><br>No, in fact I often told clients that had I experienced what they had (e.g., rape), I might let my personal issues get all mixed up with theirs. I totally and completely agree with you about the expert worship in our culture. It really makes me mad. We are prohibited from doing more and more things ourselves for our “safety.” Please. Even though I have a Ph.D., people still ask me how I will be able to teach my kids through high school. I have to ask them, “Do high school teachers breeze into class with a wealth of knowledge that they just begin imparting to their students or do they use a textbook and curriculum?” If they use curriculum to teach, why can’t I??<br> <br>>>>And I'd also challenge the statement that you are "not successful at time management". What does that even mean?>>><br>Yes. You’re right. That’s the perfectionist in me coming out (yes, I have that side, too). When I tell people about this book or website I’ve read, I invariably hear, “How do you have time for that?” I feel I have to justify my use of time which is just plain silly. We all have different priorities. The people who ask me this in an accusatory way may spend lots of time watching TV and text messaging. I don’t.  The other issue is I get irritated with myself for not getting everything done that I planned or for spending more time writing massive posts like this one instead of other things. LOL It doesn’t mean that I don’t earn at least a B in managing time, however.<br>>>>I knew a professional performance musician who looked down at my wife because she is a music teacher.>>><br>Oh my gosh, I know this issue well. In grad school, the faculty looked down their noses at me because I wanted to be a clinician and not a researcher. Then when I chose to stay home and teach my children, my friends and family had to comment on what a waste of my education it is. Honestly, if I had helped hundreds of clients in counseling and had screwed up kids who were neglected by their mother, that would be a waste in my opinion (I am NOT saying that this happens when mothers work; only talking about my personal priorities). I didn’t try to choose for anyone else just like your wife didn’t. So why do others try to choose for me? <br>>>>Oh trust me, that cracks me up as well. I mean really, memorializing one's grocery list in a beautifully bound book (only from the politically correct company, of course) of acid free paper written in the gorgeous shade of emerald green ink which flows perfectly from the polished 18k gold nib of a $200 pen and slowly dries on the creamy white paper in a way that .... EEEEEEK, soft porn!!! To say nothing about OCD! ;-)<<<<br>Mike, I think you’re on to something important here. We have to stop taking ourselves so seriously.<br></div>

<div class="content">Matt, thanks for the fabulous link. I loved his article on the 7 problems with goals. I agree that I haven't really committed to good TM. But how does one do that exactly? It was so much easier for me to commit to working out 6 days a week with Body for Life. I think the problem is that my "goal" for it tends to be so unrealistic. Subconsciously the goal is never to "waste time" and I can't ever achieve that. I just don't know what a reasonable goal is. I can be 100% committed and then I have to take a kid to the ER or get drop-in company. What does that mean about my time management? Nothing? Or what does it mean when I have had a very, very difficult day and I feel I "need" to spend time online writing like I am now. <br><br>In accordance with the article, my TM goal needs to be a positive vision, not "Don't waste any time online." I know that I'll never achieve that goal and honestly don't even want to. Just thinking aloud, but I wonder if a time goal like Body for Life would work? Six days a week you stay fairly disciplined. In other words, if I adopted this approach, I would perhaps only check Facebook and this forum once a day during six days but then would take a free day once a week to do whatever I wanted. Hm. I really loved that aspect of BFL, so I'm going to give it some thought.<br><br>Anyone have any ideas of compelling TM goals that are also realistic?</div>

<div class="content">From "The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem" - the conclusion - I worked with the sentence completion methods daily from his books for a few years off and on, and they work like a charm:<br><br>"The first enemy of self-esteem we may need to overcome is *laziness* (...the name we give to the forces of intertia and entropy as they manifest psychologically).  Sometimes, of course, laziness is abetted by fatigue; but not necessarily.  Sometimes we are just lazy; meaning we do not challenge inertia, we do not choose to awaken.<br>The other dragon we may need to slay is the impulse to *avoid discomfort*.  Self-responsibility...demands that we relenquish fantasies of a rescuer. ... Living purposefully pulls us out of passivity into the demanding life of high focus; it requires that we be self-generators.  Living with integrity demands that we choose our values and stand by them, whether this is pleasant and whether others share our convictions...<br>Here is the basic pattern:  First, we avoid what we need to look at because we do not want to feel pain.  Then our avoidance produces further problems for us, which we also do not want to look at because they evoke pain.  Then the new avoidance produces additional problems we do not care to examine - and so on.<br>Here is the reversal of the basic pattern:  First we decide that our self-esteem and our happiness matter more than short-term discomfort or pain.  We take baby steps at being more conscious, self-accepting, responsible, and so on.  We notice that when we do this we like ourselves more.  This inspires us to push on and attempt to go farther.  We become more truthful with ourselves and others.  Self-esteem rises.  We take on harder assignments.  We feel a little tougher, a little more resourceful.  It becomes easier to confront discomfiting emotions and threatening situations; we feel we have more assets with which to cope.  We become more self-assertive.  We feel stronger.  We are building the spiritual equivalent of a muscle.  Experiencing ourselves as more powerful, we see difficulties in more realistic perspective.  We may never be entirely free of fear or pain, but they have lessened immeasurably, and we are not intimidated by them.<br>... doing what is difficult but necessary need not be "a big thing."  We do not have to catastrophize fear or discomfort.  We can accept them as part of life, face them and deal with them as best as we can, and keep moving in the direction of our best possibilities.<br>But always, will is needed.  Perserverance is needed.  Courage is needed.<br>The energy for this commitment can only come from the love we have for our own life."<br></div>

<div class="content">I would imagine if one actually read Judgment Day or The Six Pillars, you would know that he is remarkable in his honesty - warts and all.  Unlike some of the gurus we look up to, he didn't keep his skeletons in the closet or deny or explain away his mistakes (think Clinton or Ted Haggard) and I don't look down on him for that, rather I find it admirable.  That's one of the Six Pillars - integrity, and he admits in those books that he regrets those years and not being conscious of what he was doing and the effect on everyone involved.  Let him who is without sin cast the first stone.<br><br>Of course, I could have gone through years of therapy instead of revolutionizing my whole life and outlook using his methods in a gentle kind of way.

At the same time, I have the commitment to act, whether it's enjoyable in the moment or not.<br><br>Was it Christine B or Mel who has written about what she's learned from looking at the tasks that she was resisting?  This seems to be happening for me right now, and it's been a little embarrassing to realize what minor feelings of potential discomfort can lead me into inertia!  The other day I was avoiding moving forward on dinner, and when I stopped & asked "What is that?", I was shocked to realize it was just the sense that uncooked chicken feels icky to touch.  I asked myself how that related to my values & goals, and made the choice to cook the chicken.  The total contact time w/ the uncooked chicken was less than a minute!  And without RAF, I wouldn't have even had the conscious awareness that that was the barrier.  Would have just been "Don't feel like it" & have not done it!<br><br>Branden's articulate expression on this topic is helpful to me.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Kathy, thanks for your post and I'm glad mine was helpful in any way.<br><br>It seems we all have our little sticking points that AF helps to uncover.  Mine is overwhelm and I'm so grateful to Mark for developing this system that made me aware of that.<br><br>With the chicken thing, there's always rubber gloves or a fork, I guess.  Turn it into a game of learning to use chopsticks?  :-)<br><br>learning, no offense taken - we're just discussing ideas, you're not attacking my children!  :-)   I'm not selling anything and I've got no vested interest in whether someone thinks a program I really valued is any help to them.  I grew up in an abusive household, so I probably needed to work on my self-esteem directly more than the average person and I credit "him who shall not be named" :-) with a lot of my personal growth.<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Mel and learning, <br><br>Sometimes those not picture perfect childhoods can be good - I can't imagine getting my 8 year old out in a field to pick stumps or rocks for a month of 14 hour days like we did.  But it does teach you to push past your limits and buckle down and do what needs to be done.  By experiencing a military style of "motivation" first hand, you can learn to do the opposite and get people engaged and *wanting* to work out of joy vs. fear.   <br><br>I've called in sick on 2 occasions in 28 years of working - which is kind of stupid in hindsight since I was probably infecting other people with my germs - but sometimes when I see people at work taking "stress leave", a mental health day, or going on disability (yet can travel and play sports, etc.) - because they just don't want to be at work, I think of my mother saying "quit playing with your head."  When did we stop feeling that we had to do what we're paid to do?  <br><br>That's one of the things I like about AF, when you're faced with dismissal of a page or task, it triggers that "quit playing with your head" thought in me.  :-)<br><br>At least things were not as bad as this in some ways, it's a good post and shows that insight into someone's world can lead to understanding where they're coming from:<br><br><a href="http://blog.penelopetrunk.com/2009/07/21/how-to-decide-how-much-to-tell-about-yourself-on-your-blog/" rel="nofollow">http://blog.penelopetrunk.com/2009/07/21/how-to-decide-how-much-to-tell-about-yourself-on-your-blog/</a><br></div>

<div class="content">Okay, Jacqueline, that post had me sobbing and I'm a psychologist for heaven's sake. <br><br>I had some childhood experiences that weren't great. I cannot elaborate here, but would be glad to discuss it with you via email. Depending on how I look at things, I can see my response to them in a positive light or a not so positive light. I think a little like you, Jacqueline, I learned to be tough and take care of myself. I would not be where I am today had I NOT had those not so great experiences. Any success I've achieved in life has required the mental toughness and fortitude I developed as a child. However, there's a big downside. I handle things to a fault. I can't let anyone take care of me. This creates problems for me spiritually. As a Christian, I want to trust God, but I don't. I handle things myself and ask God to deal with whatever I screw up. I don't know what your experience is like, Jacqueline, but it's very, very exhausting for me. It creates an unhealthy balance in my marriage. My dh wants to help me, but I just keep doing everything. I don't ask for help. I remember in graduate school I didn't understand anything my advanced statistics prof was saying. He had a heavy accent which didn't help. Everyone else in the class camped out in his office so they could get help with their work. Not me. Everyone thought I knew exactly what I was doing and that's why I didn't ask for help. Nope. I was slowly losing it. But for the grace of God, I would have gotten expelled. I finally told my prof that I had been struggling and asked for more time, but even then I NEVER WENT TO HIM FOR HELP. I am quite sure those months aged me beyond my years. We don't know what the cost of this kind of living is for us emotionally, physically, or spiritually. This summer I have really been trying to ask for help. The chronic illness I've been experiencing is a godsend in that way. <br><br>That said, I don't know you or your experiences. You're an incredible lady and I've so enjoyed getting to know you here. But like anything else we discuss here, I offer these thoughts for you to consider and see if they resonate with you. Feel free to email me.</div>

<div class="content">I have been out of touch for a few days. It looks like this discussion has taken some most interesting turns. Gee—there are so many things I could respond to! (Mike~your response to mine, of last week about quitting smoking, had some wonderful insights—thanks. And Jacqueline--that quote really stroke me. I will give that one some thought for sure. Thanks for sharing it.)<br><br>And Mel, I just had to respond to your recent post. (I sure wish these posts were numbered as they would be ever so much easier to identify. Mark-if you’re even reading this far into this thread :~)—any way to do that???).<br><br>On Receiving: I have reflected on this a lot and recently had a great conversation with a dear friend of mine who is facing some very tough challenges with cancer, which she has been battling for 17 years in various forms (she has an amazingly strong spirit). But this last event really forced her to ask for help. And while there were lots of friends around her offering to help, she revealed to me that it was really hard for her to do so.  So I relayed to her a story from my own life that taught me a lot about receiving. <br><br>The Book Story:<br>This happened about 12 years ago. I was on a very tight budget at the time and was going with a friend for a day to a wonderful adjacent town just to enjoy ourselves and get away. I had taken a precious $25 to buy myself something, a rare treat indeed. We went into a little used book store and I came across a set of books I had been looking for for years. It cost $25. W0w-I was thrilled. I went up to the counter and as I was purchasing those books another customer saw what I was buying and said, hoping against hope, “Oh my, I have been looking for that set of books forever—do you happen to have another?” (Keep in mind, this is a used book store). The clerk said no, that was the only one and that she had just put them out that morning. The other customer was disappointed, but said to me, ever so genuinely “I hope you really do enjoy your books. I’ll find my set someday I’m sure!”.<br><br>We walked out and some part of me just had to turn around an go back. I did and went back into the store, found the woman and gave her the books. She of course offered to pay for them, but I told her No, they were a gift. <br><br>It is what happened next that has stayed with me to this day.<br><br>She was so incredibly gracious in her receiving that it rather caught me off guard and made my heart leap (open). The way she responded to my offering was so heart-felt it was amazing. No pretense of appreciation, just real, authentic gratefulness. I felt great, but in a different way than usual (when giving). She was so real in her receiving. It was a moment of grace in a most innocent and simple way. <br><br>It was the purest experience of giving and receiving I can remember having in my life. <br><br>And I am so grateful to her for allowing me to learn the value of being an open, receptive recipient of another’s gift, or any offering. I saw in a few short minutes how a gift (and later upon reflection any offering of help or comfort) if not received is one-sided. And how, as a result, the giver can be left unfulfilled or their generosity left unacknowledged. <br><br>I really did get to  experience how wonderful it felt to be the giver when one truly receives what it is you are offering to them. What a blessing! My heart to this day opens a bit when I recall this experience. It encourages me to give again, and again. Not that I expect that kind of response, as one never knows how a gift will be received. <br><br>But most importantly it was a lesson in how to receive and taught me to allow receiving as a part of my life (which btw, it is an on-going process!). And Mel, I feel there is a strong spiritual component to this, but this really isn’t the place to go into that. (If you want, we can email on this. Just let me know. Certainly something I have given a lot of thought to. But I do believe we can learn these things later in life, and that Grace can have something to do with it! But this does go into another topic….)<br><br>As to my friend dealing with cancer, she said she saw receiving, and also asking for help, in a different light and would work on getting better at it. <br><br>Another interesting aside to this story is how that one act of gracious receiving by a stranger in a book store could potentially affect so many people. We really are connected, aren’t we.<br><br>Does this have anything to do with AF? No. Not really. Sorry about that ;~)<br>~Beth</div>

<div class="content">Hi Avrum,<br><br>>>>  Nathaniel Branden, while a prolific writer, has a certain yuch factor about him. And that he's written/counseled about relationships is even more disturbing.  <<<<br><br>I feel that one has to judge ideas separate from the person who promulgates them.  IOW, the alternative is basically the ad hominem fallacy.  I'm sure that Adolf Hitler thought that dark beer was tasty, and I surely won't abstain because of his other "personal quirks".<br><br>Branden is no more "yuck" than many others.  He surely has his issues, but don't we all?  I think that he is a person of decent character, so far as I am able to ascertain, even though he has not always made the best choices in his personal life.<br><br>As to relationship advice ... I have to agree that as someone who has not sustained a single long term relationship he is not qualified to speak from experience.  Yet if the advice he offers is sound, judged by objective standards, then it remains sound, nonetheless.<br><br>I have to confess to not having read all of his written works.  I do know his "basic" ideas and I "basically" agree with them, despite any personal failings he might have shown in his own personal life.  Self-esteem is important ... his failed marriages does not negate that fact, I'm sure you'll agree.<br><br>Another big communicator in the field is Tony Robbins.  His personal life is a mess, so far as I can tell.  Yet that does not discourage me from recommending his works to people who are looking for ways to improve their situation.  Even his relationship advice is sound, from what I've read ... it is just that he has not followed it himself.  So does that mean the advice is bad, or that he lacks integrity, is weak, or whatever?  I think it is the latter.<br><br>I'll bet that if we dig into the background of almost anyone, we can find things to criticize.</div>

<div class="content">Avrum,<br><br>>>>  Jacqueline - there's a point where repetitive actions should serve as a red flag. It is not uncommon for guru-like pesonalitiles to have very shadowy lives. We should pick and choose them carefully.<<<<br><br>I can hardly argue with that advice.  Except that I would counsel that it would be best to not pick a "guru" at all.  And in taking some of Branden's advice, I did not do so ... nor I suspect did Jacqueline.  I pick and choose advice without picking the person to be a guru.<br><br>In the time management field, I have been (and continue to be") critical of David Allen.  His background is shady, but that is not my reason.  My reason is that his advice is lame.  It reflects solutions to problems that HE has but I don't.  I feel that this is a reasonable basis for criticism ... the advice he gives.  That I relate it back to WHO he is, is beside the point.  It is more of a way to explain the "why" of it, rather than the actual reason for criticizing.  If you get the distinction.<br><br>>>>  However, if you're able to separate " the wheat from the chaff", and grow, heal, learn... that's great.  <<<<br><br>I suspect that the general level of intelligence of people here is high enough that they are less likely to fall into the hero worship trap than most in the general population.<br><br>In another post you decry people in the field not "walking the talk".  Agreed.  But then is that entirely necessary?  Are you as critical of engineers who beat their wives?  Do you deny the validity of cell phone technology because some of them are just "yucky" people?  Surely we continue on with the space program despite our feelings about Werner Von Braun.<br><br>I wish that everyone had perfect integrity ... but it is just not the case.</div>

"Mind like water" is an idea that comes from a person who feels his mind is in some kind of chaos.  I would never have thought of that concept in the context of a To Do list!!!  An empty in-box is nice ... but desks in museums have empty in-boxes too.  It does not necessarily speak to productivity ... it mostly speaks to obsession.  Context lists and next actions speak to deep insecurity about something gaining on you ;-)  <br><br>What I think makes AF different is that it does not promise psychotherapy.  It promises that if you work the rules you'll knock off things in a reasonable manner.  Your state of mental and spiritual health has more to do with what you put on the list than how well you tick them off.<br></div>

Because I know both therapists, I have a better understanding of how they derived their ideas re: divorce.   <<<<br><br>But you have shifted the argument!  The original question was about the soundness of the advice, not if you could "understand how they could reach the conclusion".  Moreover, unless you are a mind reader of unparalleled talent, you can't possibly know what those two people really think about the world.  It is hard enough to know what we think and feel let alone get inside of the head of another person and understand them.<br><br>>>>  The therapist who is divorced, approaches marital difficulty with a cynical, almost sarcastic, undertone. <<<<br><br>Then his therapy fails because of his cynicism ... NOT because of his divorce.  You may CONCLUDE that his divorce has something to do with it (and it may) but I don't care a bit about his divorce ... I care about his advice.

Not because he is divorced, but because his world view does not match mine.<br><br>>>>  The therapist who is married, to my ears anyway, has a much more optimistic outlook on marital difficulty. A couple in crisis will experience a radically different therapy depending on which therapist they see. <<<<br><br>I'm quite sure that is true.  I'm also quite sure that the value of the advice has to do with the advice itself.  Take the second man, if he insists that "it is time to get to work" when the couple in question obviously have nothing in common, then he is just causing pointless pain and I would say that his advice is dead wrong.  The first man would be giving better advice telling them to get a divorce, even IF his advice were based on his own experience.  In that case, his experience would probably better match the situation of the couple in front of him.<br><br>>>>  Again, both therapists operate from the same theoretical framework. So knowledge about a therapists background is critical before investing time/money in therapy. <<<<br><br>Yeah, but then how many people actually do that?  And how many would even know how?  And how would they even begin to find out a therapist's religion or political views or whatever?<br><br>>>> Moreover, we encourage clients to ask therapists personal questions during the first session of therapy. For example, a therapist who is an atheist will have a difficult time dealing with religious issues.  <<<<br><br>Yeah, but then that gets into the real issue.  What if the genesis of the problem is that the patient IS religious?  Better advice would then be given by the atheist.  The religious therapist would be largely blind to religion causing the problem.<br><br>>>> In the book "Sanity and Sanctity", the authors (a psychiatrist - atheist - and a psychologist "observant Jew") conclude that religious couples seek out therapists who hold beliefs similar as their own.  <<<<br><br>They would likely not have much rapport with someone who is very different.  However, the downside is that they are going to hear what they have heard and be advised to do what they were taught to do and probably got them into the pickle in the first place.<br><br>>>>  Let's return to Mike's quote:  <<<<br><br>O.K.  Let's do that ;-)<br><br>>>>  "I have the experience of being married to someone who was wrong, and now one who is right.

And while therapist 1 and 2 would agree with that statement, their experience with marriage/divorce had a profound impact on how where they proceed with therapy.  <<<<br><br>Yeah, but that is just one theory.  Theories are like ... well, you know the rest of that analogy ;-)  No matter what you say about other things, I married the WRONG person.  Wrong ... for me.  Right for someone else.  In Enneagram terms, she was a 1 and I a 5.  Not a match made in heaven by that theory.  However, use any theory you like.  When we looked at life, we had a different view.  I saw life as fun, relaxed, and unfolding according to its own plan.  She was driven by a desire to gather wealth.  Neither view is wrong ... but they don't result in peace and tranquility when mixed in a marriage.  Or at least when one person sees the other as "wrong" because the same belief is not held.  Don't get me wrong, I loved her up until the day she died (and still, if you want to know the truth) ... though until that day she drove me crazy and continued to educate me about my inadequacy.  Love and compatibility sometimes have little to do with each other.<br><br>>>>  Therapist 1 would be much more supportive of divorce and Mike's decision.<br><br>Therapist 2 would be much more cautious about divorce, warning that - given the right dose of anxiety/stress - you might find yourself seeking out another partner ad infinitum.  <<<<br><br>Yes, and BOTH of those positions are sound.  It comes down to the details of the couple in the office.<br><br>>>>  Without knowing the background of each therapist, one might assume that their approach to family therapy is rooted in theory. It is not. Therapist 1 has chided therapist 2 for wearing "rose colored glasses". Therapist 2 feels that Therapist 1 has abandoned his theoretical roots.  <<<<br><br>And perhaps neither has acknowledged that the advice has to be tailored not to some theoretical patient, but to the one sitting in the chair in front of them.<br><br>And what is so bad about abandoning theoretical roots.  I doubt much progress is made by those who old to their original ideas.<br><br>>>>  I'm sorry Mike but when we're vulnerable, we do not have the emotional capacity to judge ideas objectively. Worse, it is during these times when we're much more prone to be influenced by therapists, healers, etc. It is crucial that you do your homework BEFORE you you wade into these waters.  <<<<br><br>Two things about that ...<br><br>1) Yes, but if the homework has to do with the lifestyle of the therapist, it CAN be simply bigotry.  What about not wanting to see a black therapist ... because he can't know what it is like to be white?  Is that logical?  Could be.  Probably is by your theory here.  What constitutes a REASONABLE or VALID basis for deciding on a therapist.  Who knows?  I think it usually comes down to rapport.  Would I see a therapist who was NOT an atheist?  Yes.  I don't think having a religious belief matters, per se.  But if he started justifying his advice with biblical quotes, I'd be outta there like a cheetah leaving a salad bar.<br><br>2) I'm getting from our conversations that our world views are very very different.  I don't see people as inept.  I think people are resilient and capable and can usually deal with their situations given good advice or not so good advice.  In a relationship conflict, the problem has been usually going on for some time.  It is not as if lightning struck and the couple is in a daze of confusion and "vulnerability".  They have had time to adgust to the nature of the problem (subconsciously at least) and so are probably able to make informed decisions ... at least as informed as they ever make ;-)<br><br>Some time ago I had some dental work done.  I'll not go into it all, but not only was it painful, but I was not prepared for the kinds of news the dentist was giving me.  Well, I'm on a Dental plan so I don't pay to see in-network dentists.  Yet when I was leaving the office the person at the desk gave me a bill and asked for payment.  I was in a daze and gave her my credit card.  It took me all of 15 minutes to regain my sanity and be on the phone to the DMO and back to that office to demand they reverse the charge.  I was in a daze and that was taken advantage of by a crook.  But even so, I recovered almost instantly and handled it.  Were I to go back there (yeah, like that is going to happen) I'd not be in a daze.  I'd be on high alert to their practices.  My point to this is that people are "confused" and "vulnerable" mostly because if an instant and confusing change in their situation ... not one which evolves gradually.<br><br>So, my world view seems to be very different.  I see people as competent to decide the value of advice and have no trouble telling anyone to evaluate the advice itself, and not the personal context or character of the advice giver.<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi all<br>This is fact blended with my analysis of it.....IOW, just my under-educated opinion.....<br><br>me: regarding good advice not followed.... It could be  because of conflicting priorities like Jefferson wanting to abolish slavery yet owned 150+ because he led a lavish lifestyle  that cycled between prosperity and poverty. He was a guilt-ridden hypocrite and periodically freed some slaves to both honor his highest principles and also to both assuage his guilt yet keep the labor force to sustain his lavish lifestyle.   Also, slaves were better workers in the fields and were a  permanent labor force vs indentured servants. The indentured servants became the overseers.  <br>He wrote clauses against slavery but they were deleted in deference to the 3 southern states co-authors...not entirely unlike bills going through congress and the senate today.  That's why pork-barreling practices are able to thrive. The bills is passed for the important stuff even though they don't agree with some of the "riders" attached to it.<br>Also, less than 1/3 of the authors were slave holders and many were active abolishionists.  They had to modify it to get it done and distributed to the people.  With those famous lines preserved, they could build on that....changing the prevailing cultural attitudes of what's acceptable takes time. This dovetailed well with their abolishionist efforts and incremental change processes.  Abraham Lincoln later stated that he detected the intent and the desired final result.  He wanted to be the active agent of change he saw "coded" into the document.<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Good Morning Mark,<br><br>>>>  Just how valid is a declaration by a bunch of slave owners who wanted to avoid the British Government's attempts to regulate and eventually abolish slavery? They dressed it up in noble language, but basically the "freedom" they wanted was the freedom to oppress other people without interference.<br><br>(I am of course English so tend to be biased on the subject!)   <<<<br><br>YIPES!  I guess ;-) ;-)<br><br>Just a few bullet points:<br><br>- The document is as valid as we make it.  It formed the basis of our government and was ratified so it is valid on that basis.<br><br>- The ideas are as valid as they stand analysis.<br><br>- The ideas came from directly from John Locke and Algernon Sidney (according to Jefferson) -- Englishmen both.  So if you don't like the ideas, look to Locke ;-)<br><br>- The spit from England had to do with taxes ... not much else.  Slavery was no issue at the time (nor for many years afterward).<br><br>- England's interest in America had to do with taxes ... not much else.  George had to pay for some pretty costly wars and money had to come from someplace.  It surely was not going to come from English citizens who would not stand form more taxes.  Far better to tax those who were far away and could not "vote".<br><br>- They did not "dress it up in noble language".  Jefferson genuinely believed in those concepts he wrote, in so far as he understood them in the context of the times.  However, slavery was an economic reality and he was as caught up as the rest of the property owners.  (It does not make a lot of sense to judge or interpret how people thought and acted with reference to a time, context, and intellectual environment in which they did not live.)<br><br>- They did not want the freedom to oppress, they wanted to avoid paying onerous taxes.  England was not at all intent on freeing slaves in America.  As I remember it, England was big into the slave trade at the time.<br><br>- Slavery only became an issue in America when the North industrialized and it cost more to house and feed a slave than to oil a machine.  However, picking cotton was best done by slaves so the split was along North/South climatological lines.   Even then, it was less about slavery than other economic issues ... slavery was just the rallying cry to get the Northern states behind the war effort.  Much like our "war" with Iraq was about oil and the rest was all propaganda for local consumption.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>Your post about "coded" seems to have vanished.  I was going to comment that yes, the civil war was a nasty business ... but it really did have almost nothing to do with abolishing slavery.  It was about subjugating the South who had a mind to succeed and that could not be tolerated.  Slavery was just the propaganda of the times to get the poor dumb slobs to sign up to get their limbs blown off.  As it ever was with governments and war.<br><br>I don't know about America being England's only failure.  I think India was a pretty big one as well.  I don't know enough about it but England certainly did a good job with Canada, so far as I'm able to understand.  Similar geographic situation but very different outcome.</div>

<div class="content">Learning,<br><br>Good analysis and far from uninformed or reflecting "under education".  A couple of things to note:<br><br>- The split from England was far from a universally supported position.  Many here were loyal to England in the war.<br><br>- Jefferson was a slave owner out of necessity.  I can't conceive how one could be a large farmer and not be a slave owner in those times.<br><br>- Jefferson's lifestyle ... I'm not sure I'd call it "lavish".  He had to maintain some level as he was the President, after all.  However, he was mostly in debt and died bankrupt.  At one point he had to sell off his library to the Library of Congress which gave him chump change for it.<br><br>- It would be interesting to read the history of today's times 300 years from now.  Will they talk about how citizens were "enslaved" to the banks?  There is an argument to be made ;-)<br></div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>Their game is to pretend that they've forgotten that I'm disabled and ask the impossible of me and chortle between themselves when I'm shocked that they could possibly forget.  I always knew that it's impossible to forget, but I thought they were being cruel because I was too stupid to be considerate to any longer......now I know it has something to do with that triangle aliance thing. When I had my wits and agile body, they couldn't get away with much.  Now, I simply don't care as much what they are thinking, so long as their cheap cruelty doesn't physically harm me....<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Learning,<br><br>>>>  re: that Ramsey cook....just one episode (partial) and I had to turn it off....he came off as a cruel, terrorizing buffoon!....I'm sensative to cruelty.....so, alas.....I can't glean much when my disgust and fear are tripped off! LOL!  <<<<br><br>Yes, I hear people say that, but I've known chefs and that is how they are.  That show is pretty authentic with respect to the personalities.  They all smoke, drink, swear, and have egos the size of houses.  Very authentic.  If you look at it from the right angle, it is pretty funny.  Knowing the personalities involved, that is the only way to communicate with them.  The reaction you had is much like reacting to the harshness of boot camp.  It is necessary for the outcome desired.<br><br>West Wing:  Yeah, great writing.  You may not be able to find it unless you have cable.  Often these things are on the net.  If you are good at downloading from binary newsgroups, they have the episodes there.  I just checked.  (Let me know if you don't know how to get to the stuff.)<br><br>German Shepard:  <arf arf .... Timmy's in the well ... arf arf>  LOL ;-)  Maybe if/when I move to the mid-west I'll get a dog.  For now, it would be too confining for it.  And my cats would have a fit!  ;-)<br><br></div>

<div class="content">"I do owe you a world of thanks for posting that click that introduced Bowen theory"<br><br>Oh, I'm so glad you enjoyed the material. I started out as an individual therapist but slowly adopted the System mindset. I still see individuals, but encourage family work whenever a client is motivated. Awesome stuff indeed.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Avrum<br>I'll bet that your name is mentioned quite a lot in many people's gratitude prayers....In fact, your helpfulness was the theme driving the week's anonymous gift of kindness.  I wasn't taught to do it this way, but I found that when I think of my own gratitudes, it adds even more bang for the buck while I'm both formulating and carrying out my anonymous gift....as a child, it was framed to us as taking some of the load off of God;s back!  LOL!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike<br>to be sure, it's a small point....but....Lassie was a collie, not a GSD!  You might be thinking of RinTinTin.

<div class="content">Learning,<br><br>LOL ;-)  Yeah, I was not thinking of the breed so much as the general idea ;-)<br><br>Binary newsgroups ... shoot me a private message and I'll tell you what is up with that.  I don't want to go into it on Mark's list.  Use this address <br><br>mike.newsgroups@mailinator.com<br><br>and I'll respond from a real email address.  You can't be too careful with your email address in these times ;-)</div>

<div class="content">hi mike<br>I must be more computer illiterate than I thought....what's a private message?  Is it one of those instant message deals?  of is that an email address that you can throw away to abort spamming?  Ignorant minds want to know...*blush*<br>learning as Igo</div>

<div class="content">Hi learning,<br><br>Well, I went to bed and when I got up either your mail went awry or mailinator trashed it quickly.  Malinator is a disposable email service.  I thought mail would hang around for at least a day or so ... but maybe not... I just read the FAQ and they are a bit vague.  Yes, an email was what I had in mind and could you send another?  I'll check frequently today so it does not go "poof" before I see it.  If that does not work, I will do something else.   I probably ought to get a new email address for this kind of thing.<br><br>Awful how the spamers have tied us up in knots.</div>

<div class="content">Ah, this is good.  I got moving and created a new email I can use and not care if the spamers get it.<br><br>Erik.Satie@Softhome.net<br><br>is who I am today ... and for the foreseeable future ;-) ;-)<br><br>You can email me there and it will not be deleted.  The only thing is that I probably won't check that address unless I'm expecting mail so if anyone uses it, tell me to go pick it up ;-)</div>
