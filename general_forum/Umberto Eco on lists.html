<div class="content">Hi,<br><br>Thought people might enjoy an interview with Eco on the value of lists throughout history.  He has some great comments about the psychology of list making, such as <br><br>"The list is the origin of culture. It's part of the history of art and literature. What does culture want? To make infinity comprehensible. It also wants to create order -- not always, but often. And how, as a human being, does one face infinity?

<div class="content">For a skeptical view of Eco's opinion of lists, here's a link to a fascinating (to me) blog, "Taking Note," by an academic in the history of philosophy: <a href="http://takingnotenow.blogspot.com/2009/11/umberto-eco-on-lists.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://takingnotenow.blogspot.com/2009/11/umberto-eco-on-lists.html</a><br><br>The blog writer, Manfred, prefers Susan Sontag's depiction of list-making: <a href="http://takingnotenow.blogspot.com/2009/11/sontag-on-lists-and-collections.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://takingnotenow.blogspot.com/2009/11/sontag-on-lists-and-collections.html</a><br><br>And he adds a nice coda with a quotation on collecting: <a href="http://takingnotenow.blogspot.com/2008/10/collecting.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://takingnotenow.blogspot.com/2008/10/collecting.html</a><br><br>BTW, Manfred Kuehn (Boston University) is a devotee of a Windows-based wiki-outliner called ConnectedText. He wrote an interesting testimonial to the program here: "Some Idiosyncratic Reflections on Note-Taking in General and ConnectedText in Particular", <a href="http://www.connectedtext.com/manfred.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.connectedtext.com/manfred.html</a><br><br>His blog is, to me, absolutely fascinating as he draws in references from historians and philosophers on making and taking notes, he loves outliners, and he seems to try out every note-taking or wiki or outlining app ever released for Windows. I browsed his blog archives for two whole afternoons and wanted more.<br><br>Apologies for the firehose of information! One thing just leads to another...Now if I could only devise an SAF for making, taking, keeping, referring, and retrieving notes, my life would be complete! But then what would I have left to obsess about? :)</div>

<div class="content"><<an SAF for making, taking, keeping, referring, and retrieving notes>><br>Perhaps you mean like this:<br><a href="http://pileofindexcards.org/blog/2006/08/21/introduction/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://pileofindexcards.org/blog/2006/08/21/introduction/</a><br><a href="http://pileofindexcards.org/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://pileofindexcards.org/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page</a></div>

<div class="content">Mike:<br><br>I seem to remember trying ConnectedText out and not being very impressed with it - but perhaps I just didn't give it time. You have inspired me to give it another go!</div>

<div class="content">Alan - Thanks, I've seen those pages before but it just seems way too...something. I think maybe, for me, the AF rules for dismissal should be repurposed in the note-taking sphere to generate rules for forgetting things rather than to keep things "just in case." Also, I like notebooks rather than index cards. I really admire the thoroughness of the pileofindexcards system, but it looks like a giant beast that requires a good deal of care and feeding.<br><br>Mark - I'm on a Macbook so I've not tried ConnectedText myself. I have Devonthink Pro which is fine for my needs. I do wonder, given the way my life is not *that* complicated, whether these programs are really overkill for my minimal needs.</div>

<div class="content">I have never heard of ConnectedText before. It looks intersting. Any other suggestions for a note taking for research projects. I had thought about just switching to note cards but would like access on the web. Thanks!</div>

<div class="content">I'm one of the "keep everything just in case" types.  Hundreds of megabytes of email.  Lots of notes in Evernote.  Sometimes I even go back to get stuff.  Evernote lets me easily capture and search stuff.  Not as good as old versions at organizing, but the simple clipping and good, fast search pretty much makes up for it.<br><br>Story about keeping old stuff:  At work I'd been hanging onto a document dated 1964.  People didn't believe me that it still contained current official guidance until last year when it was specifically superseded by something new!  Even weirder was that the stuff everyone said was wrong was still there and is now being implemented.  Those guys from the early 60s were way ahead of their time.  And some related processes and requirements from those old times are resurfacing again.  Glad I kept some outdated stuff as well since I wouldn't want to reinvent some of these complex concepts and processes from scratch!</div>

<div class="content">MartyH:<br><br>Those of us old enough to have been at work in 1964 know perfectly well that nothing much has improved in terms of processes and requirements since then, in spite of all the management fads which have come and gone.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>Don't be absurd! <br><br>In those days, processes had to work. You couldn't cover over the cracks with an Excel Frankensheet which nobody has understood since the pimply youth who threw it together went off to try his luck on his own startup.</div>
