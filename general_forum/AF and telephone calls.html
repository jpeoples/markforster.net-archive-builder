<div class="content">Thanks so much Mark for the new version of AF, and thanks too to Andreas for the pdf. Used  it with friends to explain the concepts, which is brilliant.<br><br>I have a specific question re telephone calls.<br><br>I work as business development director for a healthcare company. Part of each day is spent on the phone. When I call someone, I get a variety of response, or outcomes.<br><br>Either <br>1. I get to speak to the person I want (great!!)<br>2. I leave a voice-mail<br>3. I speak to his/her PA who promises me s/he will call back.<br><br>Where the task "call X"  is in the backlog, how would you deal with it in AF terms.<br><br>My thoughts are<br>1. In this scenario, cross it out as complete, and enter any folllow up action in the active list<br>2 & 3 Not sure here, do I cross it out as "call made" and then put a reminder to chase in the active list, or leave it in the backlog so it's closer to the front of my mind.<br><br>I'd be interested in anyone's thoughts who deals with a volume of calls. It's a simialr issue when you send email and expect a response, in how you deal with it.<br><br>Many Thanks<br>Andy<br></div>

<div class="content">I put all my call in af4 list. If i let a message i looks like <br>9 (date i did it ) Call M. John 0174 756 759 / Rueil (project) / for this/that/that  M$ (i let the message). When i want to make all my calls i just skip all task for keeping nothing but calls. <br>If the call has to be made in the future ( more than a week) it goes on omnifocus or on my calendar depends on the importancy of it) hope it helps <br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Andy,<br><br>Until Mark sees this ...<br><br>I'd cross out the completed call.  No matter the exact outcome of a call that is not "finished" I'd treat it as any other "worked on but not finished task" ... cross it out and add it to the end of the open list, reworded to specify the next action.  For example:<br><br>- Joe returned call?<br>- Joe returned voice mail left on xx/xx?<br>- Follow up call to Joe. Third try.<br><br>Or something that make sense to you.<br><br>What you don't want to do is leave tasks open on the "closed list" once they have been acted upon in SOME way.  To do that leaves you in an indeterminate state on the closed list.  You count on completing and dismissing that closed list so you can draw that line and them move on to make the remaining open list the new closed list.  If you leave items open that you have worked on, it will undermine that process.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Andy,<br><br>In this situation I cross out the AF entry because I have worked on it.  Then I put an entry on my Waiting For list that tells me when I left the message and when I want to follow up if that person hasn't got back to me, something like:<br><br>10/9 Joe to return call - follow up on 11/9<br><br>I have a recurring AF task to 'check waiting for list'.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Andy,<br><br>Similar to those above, here's what I use for these cases, taken from your text.<br><br>Firstly, write Call X about Y on AF list, separate lines for each call to be done<br><br>1. I get to speak to the person I want (great!!)<br>> Cross out task<br>> no further action unless anything comes out of the call<br><br>2. I leave a voice-mail<br>> Cross out task<br>If it is not time critical when I get a reply by then<br>> Add "W - call from X" (where W is wait for)<br>> otherwise add "W - call from X" to calendar at appropriate day/time<br><br>3. I speak to his/her PA who promises me s/he will call back.<br>As 2 above, just adding a note on the original task to say talked to Z<br><br>Regards<br>Jonathan</div>

<div class="content">Even if I just reached out to the phone but then got interrupted and pulled into something else -- that reaching out to the phone counts as taking action, so I'd cross off the task and add to the end of the Open List.<br><br>Maybe that's a bit extreme, but it works great for me.  :-)</div>

<div class="content">Sorry, I should clarify.<br><br>I come across a phone-call task.  I decide to make the phone call.  I put a dot next to that task in my AF list.  I reach out to pick up the phone.  But then my son calls me and says it's time for dinner.  I go have dinner.  When I get back to my desk, it's too late to make that phone call.  So I cross it off, and add it to the end of the list.<br><br>But let's say it happens like this.  I come across a phone-call task.  I decide to make the phone call.  I put a dot next to that task in my AF list.  I reach out to pick up the phone.  But then my cat jumps up on the desk and knocks a cup of tea onto the floor.  I scold the cat and clean up the mess.  It takes 10 minutes.  I come back to my desk.  I see that the dot is still on the phone-call task that I didn't finish.  So, I pick up the phone and make the call.<br><br>In my previous post a few minutes ago, I was thinking more of the former scenario.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks all for your responses, that's very helpful.<br><br>Mike, the scenario you discussed happened exactly as you said yesterday.<br>I'd been working my closed list, and got it down to 4 items......great!!<br><br>One of the items was "call Kelvyn"<br>I did, he answered was busy, but said he'd call me back later. As inevitably happened he didn't! I left the task open on the closed list, and all day it stared at me. Couldn't do anything as it wouldn't have been good to chase him, but couldn't finish off my closed list, and certainly didn't want to dismiss as I wanted to speak to him. <br><br>I'm going now to cross it off and add it to my open list.....where almost immediately it'lll be back into closed list as it will then be time to rule the line and create a new closed list.<br><br>Thanks again<br>Andy</div>
