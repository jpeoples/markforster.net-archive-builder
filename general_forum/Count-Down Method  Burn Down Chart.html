<div class="content">Yet another method I'm experimenting with.<br><br>I start the day by listing what I hope to accomplish, with time estimates. Round up to easy numbers. High-resistance tasks get more time listed than they'll actually take. As you'll see later, that builds in a reward.<br><br>Include breaks that you expect to take and time taken for appointments (including prep and driving). Otherwise you'll fall behind and get discouraged.<br><br>Add it up, and calculate what time you expect to finish it all.<br><br>Use whatever method you like to choose the next task. When done the task, recalculate the expected end time. If you do a high-resistance task that takes less time than planned, you get rewarded by seeing the end time move closer.<br><br>Yes, sometimes you'll add to the list, moving the end time farther out.<br><br>Agile Programming calls this a burn-down chart.<br><br>I'm still playing with the best way to keep records.</div>

<div class="content">Put all your tasks in LeanKit, and it will do a burndown chart for you.   I think it requires the "premium" version.   <a href="http://support.leankit.com/hc/en-us/articles/216255058-Burndown-chart" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://support.leankit.com/hc/en-us/articles/216255058-Burndown-chart</a><br><br>I know that some Personal Kanban practitioners do this kind of thing.<br><br>Personally it sounds like too much overhead to me, especially if you are doing it daily.   It does work great for 3-week sprints and larger-scale releases in an actual Agile software development environment -- you can see at a glance if you are on track to meet your delivery requirements, and can also see "scope creep" immediately when it happens.</div>

<div class="content">Overhead? Calculations and watching the number go down is a reward.<br><br>Which might explain why, although I got the right things done, overall things went a bit slower.<br><br>Well, the right things got done until son gave me a complex appointment schedule, so I turned on the computer, and checked email and the boards ahead of schedule, without a clear goal (such as just urgent email). Then added groceries for kid (who just had minorgum surgery and ran out of her favourite mushy foods), and backing into a parked car while dropping kid's friend off (he called back, is reasonable, and glad I left a note rather than ignoring it; repairs will be relatively minor).<br><br>Overall, the car accident (and cup of tea at friend's house to relax) and groceries took longer than an hour, but I finished the day with only an hour left undone. Unfortunately, the same two things I've been not doing for a week. Things that I need to be alert for so can't do after supper (affects accuracy, time to do, and quality of sleep later), but not part of the morning routine that's finally beginning to pay off.<br><br>Thanks for the reference to Lean Kit. I'll look into it.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim,<br><br>Lean Kit looks very good. Flexible, but easy enough to set up. (The difficulty is in choosing lanes and groups, not implementing them.)<br><br>Unfortunately, the free version doesn't have burn-down charts, and the lowest paid is $12/month. Not worth it for an experiment.</div>
