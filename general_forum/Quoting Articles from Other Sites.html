<div class="content">There have been several occasions recently when entire articles have been quoted on this Forum from other websites. <br><br>Please note that this infringes the author's copyright, and I will have to remove any such articles as soon as I see them. <br><br>It is only acceptable to reproduce an entire article or significant portion of it if:<br><br>1) The author states on his or her website that articles may be reproduced in their entirety without permission.<br><br>2) If you have specific permission from the author to reproduce it.<br><br>If either of these apply, you need to say so when reproducing the article. <br><br>It is generally considered "fair use" to directly quote short passages of a few sentences, and a good way to draw attention to an article is to quote an arresting sentence or two and then give a link to the full article.</div>
