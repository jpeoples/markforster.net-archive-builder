<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2011-10-28 19:31</div>
<div class="content">Recently the amount of activity in my business has gone dramatically up.  We're liaising with all manner of companies, and the effect is much additional work: projects, meetings, deadlines, and interruptions.  So far I'm keeping up, but I'm not certain if I will continue to keep up if the volume is maintained.<br><br>Clearly, I need to get more proactive.  If I can get ahead of the game for each avenue we're pursuing, ready for what's coming, I will be able to work each more efficiently, make communications briefer, and delegate more work outwards.<br><br>I intend to keep my systems, but I will need to be efficient about what is done and how, and to cover all sides without fail.  Possibly additional strategies will be needed for time allocation, organizing communications, planning, information declutterification.<br><br>Suggestions?</div>

<div class="content">Alan -- I'm interested in your 'information declutterification.'<br><br>I've taken up the idea that information is either for action or reference. If it's for reference, then I need/want to store it somewhere. I've always had a "just in case" mentality in regards to squirreling away info, which of course leads to heaps of physical and digital detritus. When I've upgraded my PC systems and gone from, say, Info Select to some other system (usually  Word or text files), I've found that I rarely needed any of the info I'd saved. <br><br>I bought Devon Think Pro when I entered grad school a few years ago, and while it's slick, I find myself just info-dumping into it. And I think I now have another info-pile that will be of little use to me.<br><br>I can adopt the "just in time" mentality when it's a focused project (ie, finding a new hot water heater), but it's harder when I find a specific Mark Forster blog post that I want to keep for my personal library on the off-chance I'll need it one day because it speaks to some technique or mode of thought or value that captured my attention. (And web sites do go away....though not for a long time, I hope!)<br><br>I've wondered about how to create a system of dismissal similar to DWM or Autofocus for old or no longer useful info. If I haven't opened or accessed the info in a year or so, then delete it?<br><br>It just struck me that the Noguchi system could work well for this -- frequently used info finds its way to the front of the file, unused info is sorted to the back and could probably safely be disposed of.<br><br>Sorry for the info-blather! But I do feel I've burdened myself unnecessarily with the care and feeding of too much information.</div>

<div class="meta">2011-11-1 15:19</div>
<div class="content">Mike, yes, the Noguchi system makes a great "waterfall" decluttering scheme. I hoard a lot of info too, and my approach is to let it sit and go stale, until it becomes easy for me to dump it. Forcing myself to purge items after 6 months or so has proved futile, and my decisions are not very good. Boxing it up and waiting longer (a quite embarrassingly long time) makes it a snap. And it doesn't really take up that much space, in boxes. As long as one has a garage or basement or attic with a couple of spare corners—a couple of tall piles—I say the space can be reasonably sacrificed for the ease of purging.</div>

<div class="content">@Mike Brown re: "And web sites do go away"<br><br>You might try the bookmarking service, <a href="http://pinboard.in/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://pinboard.in/</a> where you'll never lose a webpage.  "Pinboard offers a bookmark archiving service for an annual fee of $25. The site will crawl and store a copy of every bookmark in your account... If the page you bookmarked goes offline, you'll still be able to see the archived copy indefinitely."</div>

<div class="content">Those pinboard folks are onto something...  There are plenty of people like me who would start using it, bookmarking all kinds of thing with the intention of using it someday (but not really ever getting around to it), and never cancelling the $25 annual payment for fear that something "important" would be lost.</div>

<div class="content">In my opinion there is no point at all in weeding electronic storage since to all intents and purposes the capacity nowadays is infinite. <br><br>The essential thing is be able to find it again if and when you want it. Indexing and tagging make this very easy.</div>

<div class="content">When old stuff is surpassed by new stuff, I tend to delete the old. There's little point in keeping the old as searches will fruitlessly find this stuff, as will browsing. It's clutter even as a room filled with piles of books is clutter.</div>

I say, if you happen upon something old that you don't need, delete it in that moment. But don't make a project to review all the Gigabytes on your hard drive!<br><br>I use a folder called "Bulletin" that facilitates this with no extra effort. In my email program, I move all timely "FYI" messages (the vast majority of emails I get) to the Bulletin folder. Periodically, I select the oldest 6 months or so of emails (which sit a couple of years back) and delete them all. The space savings is insignificant, but the search clutter savings is nice, and the only extra work is a few mouse clicks every six months.<br><br>The same technique applies to regular files on the hard drive, using a "Bulletin" folder in the OS.<br><br>I actually name these folders "_Bulletin" so that they will alphabetize to the top for easy filing.</div>

<div class="content">I don't have GDS. Strict date-order is incorrect. It's a question of what is relevant still, not what is old.  I don't spend hours clearing, nor seconds searching. I spend minutes searching, finding dumb stuff before finding the real, and seconds to minutes clearing away the rubbish.  Email is different. I find it's better to keep those around.</div>

<div class="content">Alan:<br><br>To start off with you said all old information should be destroyed unless there was a answer to the question "How will it be used?". This was in response to a couple of posts about "waterfall" decluttering. <br><br>My response to that was that modern searching and tagging made it a waste of time.<br><br>Now all you seem to be saying is that you should destroy old outdated versions should you happen to come across them in a search.

<div class="content">I also hold to that angle. I don't actively hunt dead documents, but if I finish working something, I am inclined to delete it if there's no probable future use. I could dump it into a Google-indexed bottomless pit as you suggest, and to my eyes there's little difference either way.</div>

<div class="content">Alan:<br><br><< I could dump it into a Google-indexed bottomless pit as you suggest >><br><br>You don't need to dump it. You leave it where it is. If you can find something virtually instantly, then it's not what is meant by the metaphoric expression "bottomless pit", is it?<br><br>"No probable future use" - I don't go much for that word "probable". If you delete 100 documents and then find you need one of them, would that have been a probable future use?<br><br>However what you originally said was:<br><br><br>"I've taken the hypothesis that all information exists to be used. If there's no reason to use the information, it should be destroyed. If it needs to be kept, there must be an answer to the question "how will it be used?" Answer that, and you know how to organize that information."<br><br><br>That sounds a bit more proactive than just deleting drafts once you've finished with them. Have you in fact changed your mind about this, or was I just being misled by the strength of your rhetoric?</div>

<div class="content">Possibly I don't have a well-developed archive retrieval sense that you have. <br><br>"If you delete 100 documents and then find you need one of them, would that have been a probable future use?"<br><br>If I delete something, it's because I can't imagine needing it again, with emphasis on imagination. In killing 100, it would be extremely unlikely even one would be "needed".  Most things aren't irreplaceable, and the most common reason to delete something is that I already have a replacement. <br><br>Perhaps you were mislead by the strength of my claim.  In this matter I am emphatically reactive: I only clean up what I'm otherwise working on.</div>

<div class="content">I'm with Mark on this for personal (anything I have received or created) filing.<br><br>Everything goes in the "My Documents" folder, with a default sort by "last modified date" This sort order is primarily for the convenience of having the latest saved copy at the top of the browse window when, for example, I send a mail and want to include it. In Outlook 2007 that's <alt>+N A F <return> (or one extra click after the F).<br><br>Or it goes in an Outlook file for the year. (More than a year's data in a single file tends to make Outlook unstable).<br><br>If you're on Windows, you don't need Google Desktop any more. Windows Explorer (Vista inwards) has a powerful indexed search built in. Just hit the windows key and start typing search terms (such as "From:<part of name> to:<part of name> subject:<key phrase in subject> <key word in file>"). This  brings up files (documents, data and program), Outlook items and more.<br><br>Storage expands with each (3 year) laptop replacement faster than I use it up.<br><br>This works fine for personal storage. For teams, I can see that you do need to pay a little more attention to standards of tagging and some way of knowing what's likely to be available.<br><br>And of course, you also need to think about what you might be making available to others.<br><br>However, as soon as you get into weeding a backlog, you are into a huge amount of work. So throwing it away as soon as you are finished might well be the most efficient strategy for some.</div>
