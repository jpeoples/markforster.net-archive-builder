<div class="content">Have you tried List Pro? It's what I used when I was on Windows Mobile, and there also is a Palm version. I have seen some people talking about doing DWM in List Pro.</div>

<div class="content">I used to have a palm. I recommend the datebook enhancement product, Datebk6.  It's a calendar / todo list with so many options I'm *sure* it could easily do DWM.</div>

<div class="content">Are you asking about regular palm pilots (like a palm tx or treo) or a new palm pre?  I don't have a pre, but I've used a tx for years now.<br><br>I would think that just the regular tasks and calendar would actually work very well for DWM.  It's pretty easy to assign due dates 1w or 1m out from the tasks window, and the calendar view has one which shows appts and the first several tasks due that day or in the next few days if their aren't any due that day.  Also, it flags when tasks are overdue, so it would be easy to see which tasks should be reviewed and dismissed.<br><br>I haven't tested this out, since I prefer paper for this task, and because my palm just bricked and I have no urgent need to transfer everything to my backup palm (yes, I had a second device sitting around just in case the one I was using broke.).  But that's what I recall from trying to use my palm for AF4, and what worked against the palm in that scenario is in DWMs favor.</div>

<div class="content">I have been trying DWM on my Palm TX very successfully. I use the built-in todo application and have assigned a single category to it, but that's because I need to clear out a lot of old dated todos in my other categories. I have enjoyed using very much an excellent shareware application called CanDo, ( www.elkasoft.com ) which adds features to the built-in todo lists. One useful feature for DWM is the option to change a due date to "One week from today." It also has great filtering capablity.  I can easily enter items from Palm Desktop, synch my palm, and take my list with me. When I was using AF4, it worked well by having one category be the Closed List and another be the Open List.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks guys - sorry, was offline there for a bit - this is very helpful.  I am still  finding the paper version easier to work with overall, but this is ONLY psychological I think - can't understand why I feel so much more in "flow" when I  dont use electronic - will try these thjough, seems like it should be a better way to do it<br><br>Cheers!</div>

<div class="content">DWM works like a dream on my new Palm Pre, but it is using the new WebOS and is not related to old Palms.</div>
