<div class="content">I came across this reader's letter in the UK's Daily Telegraph this morning.<br><br>Punctual procrastinator<br>SIR – How can David d’Equainville, the “positive procrastinator” (report, March 26), consider himself qualified on the topic if he got around to founding international procrastination day?<br>John R. Hall <br>Seascale, Cumbria<br><br>Here's the link referred to in the letter:<br><br><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/8407382/Procrastination-day-put-off-till-tomorrow.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/8407382/Procrastination-day-put-off-till-tomorrow.html</a><br><br>Apologies if this link has been mentioned before, I must have been busy putting off other things.</div>
