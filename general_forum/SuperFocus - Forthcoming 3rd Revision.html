<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2011-01-22 10:57</div>
<div class="content">I've now rewritten the rules for SuperFocus to make it the perfect time management system. Yes, it really seems that way!<br><br>However before I release the new rules I'm going to set myself four benchmark tests:<br><br>1. To read Tolstoy's "War and Peace" in its entirety (in English).<br>2. To blog my promised review of all the AF etc systems.<br>3. During the time it takes to do 1. and 2., to go for a walk of at least three miles for an average of at least three times a week.<br>4. To have no backlogs of any description at the end of this time.<br><br>These are the sort of tests which most time management systems find very difficult. They require consistent application over a period of time, together with successful handling of both major and minor tasks.<br><br>On successful completion of these four tests, I will release the rules. If I don't successfully complete them, then it's back to the drawing-board!</div>

<div class="content">Sounds good, but what happens if half way through war'n'peace you decide you really don't care to read any more of it - ever?  Will you push through, call the new revision a failure, or call the enterprise a success anyway?</div>
<h2>Reply by Mark Forster</h2>
<div class="meta">2011-01-22 14:58</div>
<div class="content">Definitely a failure if I don't complete it. It's only 560,000 words - a little shorter than the Hebrew Bible.</div>

<div class="content">Eel, 560000 words? Reading the Hebrew bible in English is typically considered an 8 month project. I hope you plan to finish by summer!  (The 80% way to read a book is to skip boring paragraphs or pages. :-). On the other hand, don't rush as we have plenty of good ideas here to last us.</div>

<div class="content">Good luck with all that, Mark!  You've set yourself a high target.  I'll be especially interested in how your new system handles your backlogs.  I'm sure there will be many willing testers on this forum.</div>

<div class="meta">2011-01-22 21:53</div>
<div class="content">I read War and Peace about 50 years ago - it took me well over a year - and like most people I skipped the long and boring Epilogue. This time I intend to read it much faster, skip nothing, and include the Epilogue.<br><br>At the moment I'm reading two other much shorter books as well, but don't intend to replace them once they are finished until the test is over.</div>

<div class="content">At Mark's current rate of 5% every 2 days, he should be done with War & Peace in 40 days, if my math is correct.<br><br>That's about as long as we've had to wait when he sends out teasers about a new or revised system. (It's always worth the wait, I might add.)<br><br>Of course, ceteris paribus.</div>

<div class="content">I know you stress test your systems Mark, but I didn't know to what extent.  A minor revision entails you throwing an epic and a bit more at it on a make-or-break quest... now, that is dedication to your craft,  to say the least!</div>

<div class="content">I think it's good to challenge oneself even when not proving new TM revisions to the world.   Having the goal keeps you motivated and cetera. <br><br>War and Peace is not on my goal list, but these are:<br>- working out 4 days a week<br>- getting my business to fiscal balance (several subgoals to that)<br>"no backlog" isn't a goal of mine, but I suppose a really good TM system combined with some commitment level will get one there automatically. I commit to that level and we shall see what transpires.</div>

<div class="meta">2011-01-24 13:30</div>
<div class="content">Reminds me of the Woody Allen gag about using speed reading to get through "War & Peace" in 20 minutes. Then a friend asked him what it's about. <Hesitant Pause> "..Russia?"<br><br>To read an extended text at speed like that, I've found it very useful to speed read, then mindmap the core aspects, then if necessary re-read at speed again. This isn't the best way to savour the literature, but does leads to very fast assimilation of the narrative, style, themes et al.<br><br>In terms of testing SF3 though, is this the right task to use? Reading War & Peace requires "consistent application over a period of time" and sustained focus, I agree. A monolithic task being broken down into sessions (of reading).<br><br>But does it test how SF3 will handle less literary/more diverse tasks & workload, where the skills being used are varied, the time windows vary in size, the degree of flow attained isn't consistent etc.?<br><br>}';-}></div>

<div class="content">I don't fully understand the difference. How did it become urgent?  How do you notice?  In published SF rules, it doesn't matter I think: If something becomes urgent, write in column 2 and do it. There's no rule against duplicating the existing item.</div>

<div class="content">Mark, May I ask how you're enjoying War and Peace?  I've heard several people say they started it but didn't finish it because they couldn't remember who all the characters were.  I'm quite tempted to add it to my own Autofucus list!</div>

<div class="content">Margaret:<br><br>It's a fantastic book - one of the world's greatest novels.<br><br>The characters are a difficulty because, apart from a cast of thousands, each individual character can be referred to in many different ways. Most of the aristocratic characters (and all the main characters are aristocrats) have a title, a Russian first name, a French first name, a patronymic, a surname, a diminutive and sometimes a nickname as well<br><br>So for example the main female character Countess Natalya Ilyinichna Rostova may be referred to as:<br><br>Countess Natalie (not Countess Rostova - that would be her mother)<br>Natalie Rostova<br>Natalya Ilyinichna<br>Natasha<br><br>The best way to keep track is simply to write down everyone's name as you come to it on a sheet of paper and keep referring to it.<br><br>Must go... the Battle of Austerlitz is just about to start.</div>

The only other thing that made it there was the dishes (they were way behind and needed several 'runs' to get them finished for lack of bench space) - and that was there from yesterday and had been actioned/crossed off then.</div>

<div class="content">After just about a week, here are my early thoughts (as a very dedicated DWM user) and stats.<br><br>I'm doing an electronic implementation in Toodledo, with a folder for each 25-item "page" and using task priorities to mimic two columns.<br><br>Here's a snapshot of my list as of about 10 this morning...<br><br>Pages Closed or Dismissed: 6<br>Pages Open: 5<br><br>Individual 25-item Page Stats: (open in column 1 / total in column 2 / open in column 2)<br>Page 7: 3/5/0<br>Page 8: 10/1/0<br>Page 9: 15/3/0<br>Page 10 (current page): 19/3/2<br>Page 11(last page, nothing actioned on it yet): 1/0/0<br><br>Unlike a lot of other folks, I cycle through my list MULTIPLE times daily - I'm the very embodiment of little and often.<br><br>Things are getting moved forward and knocked off at an *astonishing* pace.  I haven't yet dismissed a page for non-action; I HAVE dismissed/deleted/calendared items that I wasn't ready to work on at the moment.  There are a number of tasks that under DWM would have gotten worked on, then pushed onto page W and sat there for a week before I worked on them again, and progressed very slowly (the perfect example is transcribing a number of interviews, which is work that I am *extremely* resistant to but that has to get done if I ever want to get my PhD.  I plowed through one in just 2 days at the end of last week due to its presence in column 2).<br><br>To a certain extent, this system changes what ends up staying on the list.  Nearly every "I should/could/want to" still gets PUT on the list but then when I come to them later, if it's not something that I can/need to/want to work on at the time it gets dumped into my "AFReminder" calendar at a more opportune time.<br><br>Overall, though, I'm struck with the power to keep me moving on things.  I've always said that the dated dismissal of DWM was a strong motivating factor for me because I'm a really good starter but not such a great finisher but... it seems to be turning out that column two is even more powerful that dates!  The mechanics of WORKING the list don't quite sing to me in the way that the DWM mechanics did but I think it'll come.  A week in, I don't feel like I have to consciously think about where to put things, etc. like I did at the beginning.</div>

<div class="content">There seems to be a self-reinforcement going on.  If you move slowly, more things will be deemed urgent. (I can't wait until I get around to it because I'm moving slowly and that will take a long time).  These extra urgent items make things go slower.  You have more active tasks at a time, and you go slower.<br><br>On the other hand, if you move quickly, fewer things will be deemed urgent.  So there's less urgent items, and you move quicker.

I feel like to get in that mental groove takes 10-15 minutes as is, so stopping soon would be a waste, no?"<br><br>I think this is VERY idiosyncratic. If you read back through these forums you'll find lots of discussion back and forth between people who struggle to get through their lists once a day (like you) and people who cycle through very rapidly (me and - apparently - Mark). I'm not kidding when I say I am the embodiment of little and often... I routinely work on things in 10 or 15 minute chunks.  I don't set out to do this, it's just the rhythm that works for me.  I ramp up to things pretty quickly and honestly, I think my subconscious does a lot of the "how should I word this argument" processing when I'm not paying attention (or I have a flash of inspiration when I'm in the middle of something else, which then gets put on my list as a task to be filed away appropriately later).  I don't actually *time* my work - but when I start feeling like I'd rather check facebook than work on writing the abstract that's due on the first of March, it's time to advance it to column 2 of the next page and move on to the next thing because my efficiency is about to TANK.  There are definitely times when I will sit down and work on something for hours at one sitting... But one of the greatest gifts that Mark's systems have given me is the acceptance that there's nothing WRONG with NOT working that way.</div>

<div class="content">Mark: thank you for the clarification. I do think I have the rules right (except for your first comment about getting back to dismissed tasks). After about 18 days, I have 12 pages of tasks, only one of which is no longer active (the one with the two dismissed tasks). But like I said, I have the feeling that a few pages will be dismissed (along with their open tasks) pretty soon since I'm running out of tasks that I'm willing to do on a few of them... :)</div>

Thus, if I come across a task on an active page I dismiss it if appropriate (decide to think about this later). Skipping these tasks, when cycling through the pages. As a result I have also dismissed tasks on active pages.<br>But, my expierence shows, that this tempts to cheat the system. If no task stands out at the moment, you could dismiss one task. Thus, you had worked on one task (decided to dismiss it) and could turn to the next page without dismissing the whole page...<br><br>I'm not sure if this is good or bad :-/   <br><br>- Jens</div>
