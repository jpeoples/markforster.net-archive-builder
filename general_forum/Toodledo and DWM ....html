<div class="content">I have searched the site for description of using Toodledo with DWM. The best I found is Mike's description in <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1002402?currentPage=2#post1013557" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1002402?currentPage=2#post1013557</a> "Going electronic for AF5 or DIT2" on 12feb2010.<br><br>Basically, using due dates for expiry dates, folders for projects and tags for classification. And DWM processing using main view sorted by due-dates.<br><br>I've just been using Toodledo for less than a week, after importing the tasks via CSV from DWM.xls.<br><br>Any further tips from Toodledo gurus? ;-)</div>

<div class="content">I was doing it slightly differently.  Also using due dates as expiry dates, but  I "tag" things via contexts (Teaching, Household, Personal, Home, etc.) and had two folders: Active and Dismissed (because I like to keep track of dismissed items).  My default view was by folder, looking at "Active".</div>

<div class="content">Toodledo on the iPhone and DWM2 are my dream combination.  Here's how I'm using it:<br><br>I have two folders, named "Active Tasks" and "Dismissed Tasks".  Like Sarah, I like to keep track of dismissed tasks.<br><br>I don't use due dates, or tags.  Instead, I keep my lists sorted by "date added descending" (so that the most recent items go to the bottom).  I then set up 28 dummy tasks to represent each day.  Each of these tasks look like the following:<br><br>    ----------------------------------- F27<br><br>The hyphens visually separate each day's tasks, and of course the "F27" is the DWM2-style code for weekly and monthly dismissal (I stick to a 28-day month for simplicity).<br><br>It took me a few minutes to set up all these 28 dividing lines, but copy-and-paste made that quite easy.<br><br>The key to using Toodledo for DWM2 (at least the way I do it) is to use the "clone" command.  At the start of each day I take the top-most dividing line, clone it and then dismiss the original copy.  This has the effect of moving the dividing line to the bottom of the list.  Then as I add new items, they also go to the bottom, into the current day's list.  If I work on something but don't finish it, I "star" that item and then clone it to the bottom of the list.<br><br>The result is a nimble and easy-to-use DWM2 implementation that I can carry with me everywhere.  I can easily see the repeated tasks (the starred items) that are coming up for seven-day dismissal, as well as the 28-day unstarred tasks that are coming close to monthly dismissal.  And everything is nicely grouped into days.  Here, for example, is a portion of my current DWM2 list in Toodledo (I've marked the starred items with an asterisk -- these are much easier to see at a glance in Toodledo):<br><br>    ----------------------------------- D18<br>    Can I wire up switches on bed?<br>    Pay for daughter's swimming lessons<br>    ----------------------------------- E19<br>    ----------------------------------- F20<br>    Build garden wall (*)<br>    Tighten dining table legs<br>    Setup database for shapefiles (*)<br>    ----------------------------------- G21<br>    Update iPhone accounts<br>    Edit Tai Chi workshop notes (*)<br>    ----------------------------------- A22<br>    Do Tai Chi practice (1) (*)<br>    Fix VIM Objective-C indenting (*)<br>    ----------------------------------- B23<br>    ...etc<br><br>Since today is day E26, I can see that two items will be dismissed tomorrow (day "F") if I don't do them (these are the starred items on day F20).  I can also see at a glance which items are grouped into each day's closed list, and that I've finished everything for day E19.  With cloning, the only overhead with this approach is setting up the 28 dividing lines in the first place -- starting a new day only takes about two seconds to clone the top-most dividing line.<br><br>That's how I'm doing it, anyhow.  As I say, it works brilliantly for me.  I'm seriously in love with DWM2...I did try out Mark's new AF4 revision after reading all the hoopla, but for me it was a total disaster: I ended up spread far too thin, working on all sorts of things but not doing the work I really should have been doing.  I found that the Autofocus dismissal rules forced me to start projects at the wrong time, simply to avoid dismissing them, when I really should have been working on something else.  With DWM2, I have the freedom to choose what I want to work on at any one moment, while still ensuring that I keep projects moving forward in a little-and-often way.  <br><br>One thing I'm experimenting with is adding items more than once if I want to work on them more frequently than every seven days.  The "Do Tai Chi Practice (1)" item in the above list is an example of this: I want to practice Tai Chi regularly, but don't get the chance every day, so I set up two starred tasks in my list spread approximately 3-4 days apart.  I'll probably add a third or even a fourth task for this as I get more regular in my practice, but it seems to me that this is a good way of dealing with repeating tasks that you want to do regularly.<br><br>Hope this helps in some way...<br><br> - Erik</div>

<div class="content">I forgot to mention...<br><br>A big advantage of not using due dates in Toodledo is that it makes DWM2 completely date-independent.  I often have days when I can't do anything on my list at all...when I had my DWM2 list dependant on dates, I would "lose" days and end up dismissing things even though I hadn't had a chance to work on my list at all.  With the version I'm using, I only start a new day when I'm actually able to work on my list (thanks to Mark for this suggestion -- see <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1324685" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1324685</a> )...so items only come up for dismissal on those days when I can actually do something about them.<br><br> - Erik.</div>

<div class="content">TQ, Sarah and Kiwi Erik.<br><br>Sarah, I use Tags for classifying Home, Office or Errands tasks, as well as marking eXpired tasks. I dismiss expired tasks by marking done and adding eXpired tag to them. I like that a task can have multiple tags.<br><br><br>Erik, I note ...<br>DWM have two entry points and one dismissal point,<br>DWM2 have one entry point and two dismissal point.<br><br>I think the former is simpler for me, it's easy to just click one week or one month option when changing due date from main view. I also don't have much problem letting tasks expire when I don't do work on the list, it'll force me to work on the list at least as little as keeping some tasks from dismissal.<br><br>You used star for "unfinished" items. I"ve been using star to both keep place of current task being worked on instead, as well as to highlight tasks for next pass.</div>

<div class="content">Sarah, Kiwi Erik et al.<br>Are you all already using SFv3 on toodledo? I'm thinking of it ...<br><br>Since I'm posting this, I'll share one tip I'm doing with DWM on toodledo.<br><br>I have a daily recurring task I call <br>"(d) ***CYCLE***DWM***RESORT-VIEW***PRINTPDF***" <br>that ...<br>(1) I touch it first thing everyday with 1 week due date then resort view, so overdue tasks gets marked so.<br>(2) When reaching it again, I'll resort view, so re-entered and added tasks get sorted into correct place.<br>(3) When reaching it near start of the week, I'll print pdf booklet of the tasks, so I have a paper A7 booklet handy.</div>
