<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-05-10 20:45</div>
<div class="content">I noticed that in Mark's blog posts about his upcoming TM method, David Drake and Brian apparently went back to AF1 and was having a good time using it.  I actually had never tried using AF1 on paper but only electronically (which sucked).  So, being curious, after realizing that my own TM method was a failure:<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1090159" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1090159</a><br><br>I tried AF1 using paper and pen, but with the provision that it has to be compact, i.e. I can put my notebook in my pant's back pocket.  And that means one thing: I had to use a memo-sized notebook (or as others would call it a tickler notebook).<br><br>Now I realized that when you open a spiral-bound-at-the-top memo notebook, you can treat two facing pages of it like they are just one page because of how the notebook is constructed.  Therefore, using the 5"x3" memo notebook I got from Staples as an example, its 15-line-a-page capacity becomes virtually 30 lines a page. Using this idea, I started doing AF1.  Here is a sample of a "virtual" page (and my atrocious handwriting):<br><br><a href="http://i994.photobucket.com/albums/af63/nuntym/IMG00023-20100510-1220.jpg" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://i994.photobucket.com/albums/af63/nuntym/IMG00023-20100510-1220.jpg</a><br><br>And what do you know: it works! For the past four or five days I have used my notebook almost continually, especially since it is so compact.  And it is much more motivating for me than DWM or AF4, since I am focusing on one constantly sized virtual page at a time.<br><br>Thank you, David Drake and Brian, for reintroducing AF1 to me! And thank you very much, Mark, for making all these TM methods for us!</div>

<div class="content">This post and the survey of systems used, has caused me to realise that I have not been exactly honest with myself.  <br>Looking back I probably had my most productive time in ages when I started on AF1 and I stuck with it.  However as was commonly found, it was not the 'answer', so I moved through AF2 and AF3, without questionning about going back.  AF4 looked to be ideal and so I started this with enthusiasm but again this did not last.  I wanted to try DWM, started twice but could not get going.  So now I just have a to do list I do not always use, I am spinning like a top and getting more frustrated.  Although I probably did not give AF2, 3, 4 and DWM a proper try, i know that AF1 was much better than my current state, so I should just accept the obvious and give it a go.</div>

<div class="content">Glad to hear it's working out.  Maybe a year from now, AF2-4 and DWM will go the way of "New Coke" and we'll all be enjoying the classic, original AutoFocus. :-)</div>

<div class="meta">2010-05-12 16:03</div>
<div class="content">Yes!  I have been more productive since returning to Autofocus 1 than ever!  I see no reason to change to a different system.  Autofocus 1 is simply brilliant.  It works as the best system in that it is simple to maintain and one can focus on their work!<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">@David W: You know, I think that's also my story with the AF's and DWM.  Let us know how you're doing with AF1, alright?<br><br>@Brian: LOL, let us see.  Which kinda makes me wonder how good will Mark's next TM method will be.<br><br>@David: I'm beginning to learn that too!<br><br>@everyone: When using AF1, what's your way of tracking deadlines and time-sensitive tasks?  Is it a notebook, on a planner, or what?  How about projects?</div>

<div class="content">Hi nuntym,<br><br>I keep my calendar in Outlook 2007 as that is what is used across my university.  I keep hard due dates in Outlook tasks so I can track them eaily.  I keep a list of projects and their outcomes in a simple Word document.<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Wow, knowing how busy David (Drake) is maybe it's worth me revisiting AF1!!<br><br>David, having a project list (with outcomes) sounds like you are listing mainly your projects in AF1. Is this the case? <br><br>Thanks, <br><br>PS Great to have you back.</div>

<div class="meta">2010-05-12 20:41</div>
<div class="content">By the way, I definitely find the rules in AF1 the easiest to follow. I found with AF4 that I constantly broke / cheated with the rules.</div>

<div class="meta">2010-05-12 21:18</div>
<div class="content">Hi Leon,<br><br>Yes, I have a list of projects and their outcomes in a Word document.  I do two things: (1) I list individual tasks of a project in my AF1 notebook and (2) I make entries like "Work on Project X".  If it is a complex project, I am more likely to do the latter and keep a separate project file with all of the tasks, notes, ideas, etc.  I find this works very well and I keep many complex projects going this way!<br><br>Yes, I have found the orginal Autofocus 1 to be the best -- I love the separate, closed pages!<br><br>Thanks for the kind words, Leon.  I am glad to be back...smiles...<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for your thoughts David, <br><br>I was just wondering if you (and others) use your AF Notebook for notes also? I remember Zytex aka Paul describing that he uses 1 side for AF and the other side for notes. How do you and others deal with notes?<br><br>Thanks again</div>

<div class="content">Hi Leon,<br><br>I follow the general advice from Gerry on "The Ultra-Simple Guide to Time Management" on this.  I do not use a table of paper, but a separate spiral-bound notebook from my AF1 notbook.  In this one, I keep all of my meeting notes, phone call notes, ideas, doodles...essentially everything I write down apart from entries in my AF list goes in this one notebook.  I am finding this works very well to track things.  This combined with my AF1 notebook had made me quite productive!<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">I really, really liked AF1.  The algorithm was just so elegant, and I found I got lots done, and felt energized.  And it was simple enough to teach my kids.  (Though overkill for them at this point.)<br><br>But it broke down for me because my list was just continually growing, and I could spend weeks chasing the end of my list, without ever revisiting the earlier pages.  <br><br>DWM works better in that situation -- DWM really helps fix that problem, too.  If I could keep my list from constantly growing, I'd go back to AF1 too.</div>

<div class="content">I never tried AF1 because I looked at the rules and the discussion, and thought it was too easy to get stuck cycling through the wrong pages and never getting to important or urgent stuff. Why isn't this a problem for you advocates?</div>

<div class="content">Alan,<br><br>It used to be a problem for me but over time I learned to force myself to cycle through the whole list at least once a day. This means either doing or dismissing something on every page, and is a great way of tackling the difficult tasks.<br><br>Give it a try, and force yourself round the list. I have tried all the AFs and DWM and have gone back to AF1 because it is the only one that helps me work on the important but not urgent stuff.</div>

<div class="content">Feedback on my first week back with AF1.   Same as last time, easy to restart, in the same book I have been working for months.  Energy levels are up with the feeling of getting things done.   However my list only covers 4 pages so is easy to cycle through and the requirement to dismiss is not raising its head yet.  It is also easy to remember what is on the 4 pages.   The challenge will come when the list covers a lot more pages, with cycle times naturally slowing and the tendancy to work outside the list due to 'higher' priorities (or put another way, tasks I would rather do than tackle or dismiss the last couple on the sheet).  Let's see what the next week brings. <br>regards</div>

<div class="content">David Drake,<br><br>Thank you very much for giving us a glimpse of how you manage your time.  It has actually helped me: I now keep a separate small notebook for catching all doodles/ideas/notes/etc., and I am pleasantly surprised at how reliable it is in both catching ideas and information AND making them accessible wherever and whenever I need them.<br><br>Thanks, David, and also, and especially, to Gerry for devising it.<br><br>I have also tried your simple way of handling projects: sorry to Gerry of "<a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com"," target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com",</a> but preliminary use of David's simple listing of project titles and goals in a simple electronic form (mine is in my smartphone) while listing their tasks in AF1 is in my experience much simpler, while not sacrificing effectiveness, than Gerry's AF4'ing of each individual project.<br><br><br>---------------<br><br><br>Alan,<br><br>My solution to that is very simple: my mindset is that AF1 is more of a guide, not a dictator.  Many times when using my AF1 list I do not follow the rules when there is an urgent or important matter to be done and it is a few pages away from where I am.  As Mark Forster said in the instructions for AF1:<br><br>"DO use common sense. If something comes up which needs doing immediately, do it immediately."<br><br>It is good practice, in my opinion, to once in a while look through all pages to see if there is something urgent or important you have to do.<br><br>I hope that helps.<br><br><br>------------------<br><br><br>Seraphim,<br><br>Your comments made me think.  Maybe AF1 is effective for people with relatively few tasks (less than 10 pages?), while DWM is more effective for those with many more tasks because of the latter's more rigorous dismissal processing?<br><br>Maybe that's why I was having problems with DWM, as my current list of tasks is only 5 1/2 "virtual" pages long (including crossed out and dismissed items).<br><br><br>------------------<br><br><br>Like David W, I'd now like to add my own one-week feedback on my use of AF1:<br><br>In the middle of the week I ripped off my AF1 list because I realized mixing my errands into it  was undermining its effectiveness.  So now, I put my AF1 in the front of my memo notebook (that day was a pain, as I had to rewrite everything) and the errands at the back.  Working good so far.  I have just dismissed my first page just now, and I am off to celebrate. <br><br>*goes off whistling to Yogurtland*</div>

<div class="content">nuntym,<br><br>I put everything into the AF1 list, even errands, because it is usually with me and it is so easy to jot it down. It is then dealt with, filtered, transfered to another list (like my shopping list, which is on my iphone because I always have that with me when I am out) using the normal AF1 rules.<br><br>You really can throw anything at AF1, using it as your main collection bucket. And having all these little tasks helps to speed up the cycling through the list.<br><br>Regarding length of list, I have found it works much better if the list is relatively short -- no more than 10 active pages. If it gets much longer than that and I start to find things slowing down, I will ruthlessly dismiss items that have been around for a while. I can always add them again later when I review the dismissed items.</div>

<div class="content">As from yesterday, I officially went back from AF4 to AF1, with one small transition measure: I treated my AF4 backlog (4 open pages with 8 actions total) as a single AF1 page.<br><br>It was as if I put a new engine in the car: I experienced a boost in productivity. All actions in the backlog, some of which had been sitting there for months, were crossed off in 40 minutes... And I also managed to close 2 more active pages.<br><br>I really found back the procrastination-busting effect I experienced in the first months of 2009 when I started using AF. While with AF4, I still felt the urge to take breaks as a means to run away from the outstanding work, here with AF1 I experienced the reverse: while I told myself I should really take a break, here I just wanted to keep on going.<br><br>I suppose this renewed "novelty effect" will wear off again after some time, but still this confirms my feeling that (for me at least) AF1 is really the best personal productivity system I ever used.<br><br>So a big thanks (once more!) to Mark for inventing and sharing it.</div>

<div class="content">+AJPM+<br><br>Wooba,<br><br>Sorry fo the late reply, but I have followed your example of using AF1 as a capture-all tool and transferring my errands to my celphone according to the rules of AF1.  It was brilliant, and my AF notebook's back is now free for my capture-all-notes.<br><br>----------<br><br>Mark,<br><br>The link you posted for Wooba is a GOLDMINE, because from there I found Christine B's FAQs post:<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/645945" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/645945</a><br><br>And I got a lot from it.  For example, I found a post that discussed the relationship between resistance in using AF1 and the number of lines in a notebook.  It convinced me to look for a notebook (still memo-sized) with more lines per "virtual page," and I found one in CVS Pharmacy with 34 lines per" virtual page." After transferring my items I was surprised with how much difference it made.  I can't explain why, but there is less resistance in using it than the first one I used.<br><br>I also found a modification from you for AF1 which solves both the need for a bookmark AND for handling truly urgent items: transfer the truly urgent on-that-day items to an index card and use that as a bookmark.  Pure genius, Mark!<br><br> I also found your "Clarification: Speed Of Movement" post on your blog,<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2009/1/6/clarification-speed-of-movement.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2009/1/6/clarification-speed-of-movement.html</a><br><br>and I have to say it is a much more consistent way of going to a more urgent item on the AF list than my way of directly skipping pages to the urgent item.  Another lessening of resistance.<br><br>And last, and definitely not the least, the post itself you linked for Wooba has also helped me a lot.  It made me realize that a big source of my resistance to AF1 was actually my poor following of the spirit of AF1: I was not doing "little and often" that, uhm, often.<br><br>And oh, there is a "Weed list" item now in my AF1.  I'm not going to let my AF list grow too big before doing that ;-)<br><br>Thank you very much Mark for sharing your passion and skills in TM.  It has helped me a lot.<br><br>----------<br><br>Alan Baljeu,<br><br>Thanks for that suggestion to Gerry about a separate "Maybe Later" list.  I have made one in my celphone: what I do is I transfer all unactionable dismissed items from AF1 to the "Maybe Later" list for reconsideration in the future, and added a "Check Maybe Later List" item to my calendar (not my AF1 list). <br><br>----------<br><br>Anyways, I have made my own modification of AF1, and it is I think effective for me.  Whenever I reenter/redefine a dismissed/unactioned item into my AF1 list, I place the number of times I reentered it beside it.  I will only reenter an unactioned/dismissed up to 2x.  If after 2x being redefined/dismissed I have not yet taken action on it, it is automatically deleted from my AF1 and goes automatically to my "Maybe Later List."<br><br>God bless everyone.</div>

<div class="content">I too like the maybe later list.  What I do is simply write these items on the last page of the notebook I am using, so I review it when I am done with a notebook and transfer the good ideas to the next notebook if I still want to pursue them.  This way it is all in one place, which is a rule I always follow - to write in one place only.<br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div>
