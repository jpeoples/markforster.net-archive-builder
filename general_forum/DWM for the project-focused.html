<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">I can see the appeal of DWM for general tasks. But what about those of us who are tightly project focused?<br><br>I'm a journalist. I work on a rolling list of deadlined projects, most of which arise and are finished within a week or two. (Although I am right there with Douglas Adams when he said something to the effect of, "I love deadlines. I love the whooshing noise they make when they go past.")<br><br>I might work on an article on and off for a couple of weeks, in bursts. When it's time to work on that project, it seems counter-intuitive to be riffling through a month's worth of pages to find the contacts I'd listed during my last burst. I just want a straightforward list of to-dos related to that project so I can crunch through them. I also tend to have lots of outstanding calls and emails waiting to be returned.<br><br>I use Omnifocus, so I can see the possibility of flicking back-and-forth between project and list views. But when work is so highly project- and deadline-orientated, do the advantages of DWM fade? On face value, I should gel with GTD - only I don't. I'm looking for a sort of mash-up between the structured approach of GTD and the fluidity of the AF/DWM concepts, plus the "day's work" container of DIT.<br><br>Actually, I'm really looking for a couple of weeks at the beach.<br><br>Matt</div>

<div class="content">Write your project titles in DWM. Write the detailed plans and tasks in a separate place.  Possibly a list system could do the job for you. <br><br>You either put only one task in DwM, or else put as many as you care to. But when you work on any of those tasks always go to your project page or folder to track the details and think about what needs doing. It works quite well like this.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Matt,<br><br>I'm a researcher at a nonprofit with similar project lifestyles as you it seems. I still dump everything in DWM, regardless if it is a task, a project or a contact. If I start noticing the same project material coming up on my list over and over again (in different forms) I copy them and paste them on a project sheet (I use Excel). I then keep the "work on project x" in the DWM list.<br><br>I do have a calendar with (real) dates of project milestones and deliverables.<br><br>Hope this helps.</div>

<div class="content">Alan & veghead - so we're talking half GTD, in which we capture all Stuff related to a project in one place, and half Foster, in which the Project and/or Next Action is put into the DWM list? (Or this all Foster? Lost track).<br><br>Because I'm deadline driven, I KNOW what projects are breathing down my neck as soon as I sit down at my desk. So those are on the Today page. I might get an email alerting me to a news item I have to write for a deadline in two days time. Presumably, that gets entered for tomorrow or the day after. I have to return a call to a scientist at a certain time on a certain day: enter in the calendar.<br><br>Thinking aloud here: I see that a lot of what I do has to go into a calendar. A separate calendar from my task calendar? <br><br>I'm just going to have to work with this ...</div>

<div class="content">For me, I wouldn't call my DWM list a GTD Next Action list. If we are going to use GTD terminology, it is also my inbox, I put everything in there, add the expiry dates and get to work. If I notice a trend, many items belong to one project, I'll copy and paste them elsewhere and that becomes my "project ist". But unlike GTD, nothing from my project list goes on my DWM list.<br><br>Does that make sense?</div>

<div class="content">The DWM system doesn't work by the calendar.  The way this system works, you often end up clearing tasks out well before the system says they are due, so a task *written on* February 25 must be *worked* on *before* Feb25, which can easily be today if you choose.<br><br>So *always* enter tasks on day +7 or +30 regardless of when they are due.  If there is a special due date, write that date beside the task.  Work on tasks regardless of what day they are written on.  Select whatever you feel is important, urgent, or doable.  So instead of putting your task on a certain date, write the due date beside the task as a reminder.<br><br>A separate calendar is perfectly acceptable, but use the list to drive your work habits.<br><br>GTD? Not really.  The GTD system is Collect everything, Process everything, Organize everything.  Mark Forster's method is Little and Often: do a little.  do a little more.  If you are stuck doing, process a little.  If in doing you need to organize, organize a little.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Matt - read my discussion posting here:<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1017793" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1017793</a><br><br>This is how I use DWM with Omnifocus - it should be possible to do exactly what you want by keeping project folders / categorization, and focusing.  And then going back to your DWM view to see only the tasks that are relevant to what you are focusing on.</div>

<div class="content">vegheadjones,<br>this is the advice the most useful I've read for some time.<br>My DWM list was cluttered byt a lot of items that should have been pasted on a list elsewhere.<br>I am doing this cleaning right now and it feels great!</div>

I think it's AF "little and often" that gets me over the GTD weekly "Review/Organize everything" that I never did do properly.<br><br>MattC, I'm with vegheadjones, only bringing out tasks from DWM list into separate project list when too many items for a single project are overwhelming my DWM list. I always use a project keyword when writing my tasks. Currently caps-F Find for "AFAHK" in AFAHK shows me 3 related tasks, for example. Not too many yet.<br><br>Looks like Curt does similar in Omnifocus. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">One of the more interesting threads of late and with good advice from DWM/AF4 aficionados, that's why I drop in on the this forum quite often; note to self: put it on DWM!<br><br>Until I started on my current incarnation using ListPro, I was concerned about tracking the next task for projects or big task, essential for the 'little and often' treatment.<br><br>I suspect the OmniFocus and Excel users have something similar, but I now set up a project in ListPro, then put the various tasks required as sub-tasks.  The parent project appears in my Closed List or just left where it currently resides (<7days or <28 days), then I can expand it and see right away what has already been done (checked + strikethrough) and what I fancy doing or must do next.<br><br>And what is really nice is that each sub-task can have its own date in accordance with the DWM rules, but still be nested under the parent task project.<br><br>I also use nesting for Daily, Weekly and Monthly Routines.</div>

<div class="content">I do something similar to what vegheadjones does, only with a paper notebook for the main DWM list and postit notes for collecting projects as needed.<br><br>I could see doing something similar in an excel or google docs spreadsheet too.</div>

<div class="content">vegheadj - what you say about putting the projects on the list, rather than all project tasks, makes sense. I'll give it a go.<br><br>I have to confess, though, that I have some resistance to DWM. <br><br>The connection between projects and tasks isn't as clear as, say GTD, which has the beautifully simple concept of the "next action". <br><br>DWM's cycles (week, month) feel overly-long for someone who often works in cycles of days or even hours. <br><br>I can see the prospect of a forward wave effect, where the first month goes beautifully but then you hit a mass of old undone tasks that slow or stop momentum (I realise that this shouldn't be the case, but I'm talking about me).<br><br>And as a whole, it doesn't seem to have the minimalist simplicity that was so attractive about the original AF. <br><br>Before you throw rotten fruit, these are observations, not criticisms. I haven't properly engaged with DWM, so I may find these points redundant. But my intuitive feeling is that DWM isn't quite baked yet. It doesn't have the "aha" of something that is just right. I think Mark's got the ingredients of that "aha" system, but they aren't all in the right mix yet. <br><br>I may also be wrong ...</div>

<div class="content">I tried DWM three times and I came to this same conclusion.  Of course, this is only my own feelings for the system and I certainly realize that many have found DWM to be wonderful.<br><br>For me, I am staying with AF4 -- a fantastic system!<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Hi Matt,<br><br>Here's what I've noticed so far using DWM: The tasks related to timely projects that need to get done will always get done first. I have a press release due on Tuesday next week. The expiry date for that task is +26 days (as of today), but when I go through the list on Monday, you can bet it will be one of the  first things I do. SO I don't really need DWM for this task (and it doesn't hinder my doing it either).<br><br>But there are the other tasks, the "read this article," "find this data point" "search for RFPs.." etc. that benefit from a countdown expiry date. These are the tasks that hung out on the closed list in AF4 for a while. Seeing the days left countdown has really made a difference to me in getting them done.</div>

<div class="content">"I can see the prospect of a forward wave effect, where the first month goes beautifully but then you hit a mass of old undone tasks that slow or stop momentum (I realise that this shouldn't be the case, but I'm talking about me)."<br><br>This kind of comment comes up a lot. I am just now hitting my first batch of tasks that have rolled forward and I've had a very interesting experience dealing with them.<br><br>First I said, "wow, I haven't done anything AT ALL on this task, despite having 30 days to do so? That's pitiful"<br><br>Then I looked at the two tasks. One made me say, "Well, that was stupid to put on the list in the first place--no wonder I didn't do it!"<br><br>The other made me say, "Aw, I can't let that little fellah slip away, after sticking with me all this time. I'll just do that one little thing..."<br><br>And, in that time, I did (or began) EVERY OTHER THING on the list. Wow, for me, that's fantastic.<br><br>So, that 30 days mark, doesn't signify the crashing waterfall of undone tasks. It's a reminder to you to decide what's important and what's worth working on.</div>
