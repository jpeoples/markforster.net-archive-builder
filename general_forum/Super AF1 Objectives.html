<div class="content">Although I'm not yet ready to run an on-line demo for my new Super AF1 system, I thought it might be interesting (to me at least!) to write out my objectives for today. I've chosen today to do this because I have a full day with nothing in my schedule.<br><br>So here, in no particular order of priority, is what I'd like to get done today:<br><br>A walk of 3 or 4 miles<br><br>Watch Bergman's "Winter Light"<br><br>Wash my car<br><br>Write 2nd draft of my presentation next week in Belgium<br><br>Tidy the entire house<br><br>Write up further ideas I have for fund raising campaign<br><br>Sort out the main drawers in the bureau in my office<br><br>At least one German Grammar exercise (more if possible)<br><br>Keep completely up-to-date with routine things like email, paper, washing up, comments on my website, etc.<br><br>Write up my objectives for the day and how I got on with them<br><br>Progress on learning to use PowerDirector<br><br>Progress on learning my new camera controls<br><br>Find my car park booking details for Heathrow next week<br><br>Read some of Goethe's Faust (in English)<br><br>Write up rules for Super AF1<br><br>Make progress on Income Tax Return<br><br>Weed at least one file<br><br>Finish "A Century of Warfare" episode<br><br>Mow Lawn (weather permitting)</div>

<div class="content">Gosh - that is a lot to get through!   If your new system gets you through this lot, I will be very impressed!</div>

<div class="content">I've recently switched from DIT to AF1 and, with this Forum's helpful advice, I'm finding I'm getting more of the big stuff done.<br><br>However I'm ready to change to any system that could achieve in one day anything near to what Mark is planning to accomplish ............</div>

<div class="content">Danke, Rainer. Spass werde ich vielleicht brauchen, weil Deutsch sehr schwer ist!</div>

<div class="content">I meant that I'd need some fun because German is so difficult (as is proved by my above attempt to write it).</div>

<div class="content">Rain is preventing me from doing two of the tasks on the list: Walk and Mow Lawn. But otherwise I'm not getting on too badly. <br><br>By mid-afternoon I had done the following things on the above list:<br><br>Watch Bergman's "Winter Light"<br><br>Wash my car<br><br>Write 2nd draft of my presentation next week in Belgium<br><br>Kept completely up-to-date with routine things like email, paper, washing up, comments on my website, etc.<br><br>Write up my objectives for the day and how I got on with them<br><br>Progress on learning my new camera controls<br><br>Read some of Goethe's Faust (in English)<br><br>Finish "A Century of Warfare" episode</div>

<div class="content">Washing the car while it's raining is great, although during a break in the rain is dryer.<br><br>The dirt is pre-soaked and comes right off. The rain rinses the roof for you.</div>

<div class="content">Final report<br><br>I succeeded in doing every item on the list, except the two which rain prevented. I would have liked to have done more on my tax return - but I did do something. Otherwise everything was up to expectation. And I did quite a few things which weren't on the list as well.<br><br>I'll publish the rules on a new thread.</div>
