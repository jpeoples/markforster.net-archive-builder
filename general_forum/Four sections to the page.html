<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">Mark F suggests making tomorrow's list of tasks today, then drawing a line under it to close it.  Things that arrive tomorrow and can't wait get written below the line.  Anything else gets caught on the list for the following day.  In this way, each page is divided into two sections, not necessarily equal in size.<br><br>I've been experimenting with dividing my pages into four sections rather than two.<br><br>As Mark F suggests, if you can't get all your work done, you may have too many commitments.  I have sought to pare back my commitments by dividing my work life into four broad themes, and the same for my personal life.  If a commitment doesn't fit into one of those eight areas, it gets politely declined.  To give each theme a sense of direction, I've produced a grid for the weeks of the next six months, showing what I would like to do in each of the eight areas to move them forward.  The ambitions are balanced so that if I've got too much on in one area for a week or two, I'll defer attention on other areas until I can catch up.  <br><br>The tasks that this weekly plan mandates go in the top quarter of the task diary.<br><br>The bottom quarter of the task diary is for things that arrive on and must be done on the day, just as Mark F suggests.<br><br>The two middle parts of the page are used for tomorrow's task list, much as Mark F proposes.  The reason that there are two spaces is that I have recognised that one of the reasons I'm busy is that I do things myself rather than delegate them.  To try to stop that happening, I put things to do with delegation (managing juniors, following up delegated things) in the second quarter of the page, and things I must do myself in the third quarter.  This has the practical effect of limiting the space available to do things on my own, and makes me think carefully about how to capture the benefits of delegation.  On days where I do fall behind, it's the second-quarter tasks I prioritise, so that I maximise the output of the team rather than keeping its members waiting while I get engrossed in something solo.<br><br>Results during the first couple of months are promising, with only a handful of the top of the page tasks behind schedule, and the delegation improviing, but it's early days.</div>
