<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2011-04-9 5:58</div>
<div class="content">With all of Mark Forster's systems, I have always struggled to cycle through the list fast enough.   If I don't cycle fast enough, I can end up "chasing the end of the list" and never revisiting the beginning of the list.   Even if I do cycle through from time to time, infrequent cycling means infrequent exposure to the items in my list.  My list will work better if I am constantly exposed to its contents; the subconscious mind will always be processing them in the background.   Also, infrequent cycling means I won't trigger the "dismissal" rules, which means I will be lacking one of the key ingredients of Mark Forster's systems.<br><br>Here are some rule modifications that have helped me cycle through the list faster, in order of most effective to least effective (in my experience at least).   These modifications assume one is using the standard SF3 rules ( <a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2011/2/10/rules-for-superfocus.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2011/2/10/rules-for-superfocus.html</a> ).<br><br>1.  OVERCOME YOUR FEAR OF DISMISSAL.  Seriously.  Fear of dismissal can cause you to "game" the system and play tricks to prevent a page from getting dismissed.  Reflecting on dismissed items is one of the most powerful, even life-changing, elements of Mark Forster's systems.  Don't deprive yourself of its power.   Let "standing out" and "dismissal" do their work.   <br><br>2.  Set a time limit to get through each page so that you will cycle through your notebook at least once per day.  E.g., if you have 12 active pages, and 8 hours of discretionary time per day, then set a time limit of 8/12 = 40 minutes per page.  Set a timer, and move on when the timer rings.  If you haven't actioned anything in Column 1 yet, then dismiss everything left on the page.   I don't LIKE using this rule, since using a timer just feels "kludgey" and awkward.    But since it *IS* so effective, I do use it if I seem to be moving too slowly and need a kick-start.<br><br>3.  Enter urgent items into Column 2 on the NEXT page instead of the current page.  (If it makes you anxious to put it on the next page, because you think you won't get to it quickly enough, then go ahead and put it on the current page -- but your default should be to enter it on the NEXT page.)<br><br>4.  When you come to a new page, take action on all items in Column 2 before looking at the items in Column 1.<br><br>5.  Use a notebook with more lines per page.  (This did seem to make a slight difference when I moved from a 22-line pocket notebook to a 5"x8" 32-line notebook.  But only a SLIGHT difference.  If you like the convenience and portability of a pocket notebook, I would not recommend switching to a larger notebook simply in order to get more speed.  I am planning to switch back to a pocket notebook after I finish up my current 5x8 notebook.)<br><br><br>Here are other ideas I tried to increase cycling speed -- they didn't seem to help.   (They DID help reduce "overloading" Column 2, but did not seem to make any difference in cycling speed):<br><br>+ Make daily Column 2 tasks into daily habits so you do them as part of your daily routine instead of in SF (e.g., checklist at beginning of day)<br><br>+ Use notebook with FEWER lines per page.  In my experience this made the cycling time slower, not faster.  But the difference was only slight.<br><br>+ Block off a few lines of Column 1 on every page (so that Column 2 will have more lines than Column 1).  This didn't make any difference to cycling time.<br><br>+ De-commission Column 2 tasks back to Column 1, especially if priorities have changed.  This helped keep Column 2 "leaner", which did increase cycling time, but it's a bad habit to get into, if you are following the standard SF3 rules.  It takes away the whole reason behind Column 2 and eventually Column 2 loses its "kick".   (If you *like* that idea, then you can try Mark Forster's latest variation -- <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1453964" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1453964</a> ).<br><br><br>I also tried this idea but it seriously disturbed the "flow" of the list -- it just wasn't "SuperFocus" any more:<br><br>+ Act on no more than 1 item in C1 during each visit to the page.   This might work in an "emergency" but I would not recommend it as a general habit.   It is just far too constricting.  <br><br><br>Has anyone tried any other minor rule modifications that preserve the "flow" and overall effectiveness of SuperFocus, but help improve the cycling speed?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Seraphim,<br><br>As ever, your posts are thought provoking and this one really resonates for me.<br><br>I really struggle to dismiss, and I "game" the system to avoid dismissing. As a result I tend to only put actions on the list that have to be done rather than throwing everything at the system. I know that as a consequence I am massively diluting the power of the system.<br><br>That said, the system still works really well for me in terms of being productive - its just that I'm conscious that it could be a whole lot more powerful.<br><br>Your tips are all interesting - but for me tip number 1 is the real issue. Looking forward to putting it into action.......</div>

<div class="content">I always have a problem envisaging what it is that causes crawlers to crawl because it is so alien to my own way of working the list. And I often wish that I could stand over someone's shoulder so I could tell them what they are doing wrong.<br><br>I think it's important to pay particular attention to two of the rules. One is dismissal, which as Seraphim says above is a key element of the system. I can't stress enough how important this is. <br><br>The second is "standing out" or "feeling ready to be done". The whole idea is that your mind should act intuitively within the framework of the rules, not consciously. If you find yourself making calculations like "if I do three tasks on this page, I'll reach x in time to meet the deadline", you are not working SF properly.<br><br>However just because you are working "intuitively" doesn't mean that you have no control over what you are doing. You can instruct your intuition so that it achieves what you want it to. <br><br>In particular you need to instruct your intuition about what speed it should be going at. There is a continuum between CRAWL and RACE, and you should be considerably nearer the RACE end than the CRAWL end. It's actually no more difficult to decide to speed up while doing SF than it is to decide to quicken your pace when you are walking down the street.</div>

<div class="content">I think that the discussion of cycle rates/processing speed so far has neglected the fact that the items put on the SF list by different people will vary in terms of the time they take to complete.<br><br>My own list has no shortage of tasks that won't take long.  "Call Emma"; "Pay for printer".<br><br>It also has tasks that will take a few hours.  "John lunch" will be about 3 hours, by the time I've agreed with him a convenient date, arranged the booking, travelled to the venue, had lunch with him, travelled back to the office, and written a file note on what was discussed.<br><br>Yet other items will take days.  Some are recreational: "K wants to go to Venice".  [K is the girlfriend.]  Others are work projects: "Market entry strategy for Canada", that make best progress with focussed attention for anywhere between an afternoon and a whole day, and will probably take a week of effort to write.<br><br>Taking these things together, I'm finding that I'm moving forward or compleiting 8-10 items in what remains of a day after scheduled meetings.  There are 388 items on the list at the moment.  That means it would take at least 39 days to complete the list, and that assumes everything gets deleted as a result of being completed first time it is visited, and nothing new comes in.<br><br>You simply aren't going to get round a list that has that much on it in a day or two, unless your interpretation of dismissal is that you should dismiss anything that you have no reasonable prospect of getting to within, say, a week.  But if you dismiss like that, you'll wind up completing reactive items at the expense of long run, carefully thought-through goals.  I actively want long run projects on the list, as subjecting them to little and often processing will get them done eventually.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Dave.  I'm wrestling with these ideas myself. I think the idea is that you don't want 389 things on your list. You want maybe half that.  To get to there, move faster through the list, and if that means something important is dismissed, that's okay.<br><br>The dismissing of pages doesn't mean the rejecting of tasks. It means setting aside tasks that aren't presently worth your worrying about. After all, 180 are plenty to keep you occupied and you'll be more effective. And then through regular review you can bring some of the others back in again later when you've set finshed some of the current load.</div>

<div class="content">Dave:<br>SF is a Task" Management system.<br>What you need is a "Projects" Management system that will feed SF at the appropriate time with sizable chunks tasks.<br><br>-My 2 cents<br><br><br>@everybody<br>As Mark and Seraphim says: Embrace Dismissal!</div>

<div class="content">The "problem" I'm having that slows me a lot has to do with tasks like coding/programming where the "little" part of "little and often" can easily be 45min to an hour (minimum), and the "work as long you feel like" can to for 4 or 5 hours without even noticing (fully focused; in the "zone").<br><br>This can be specially relevant when chasing bugs in code your didn't wrote. Just the preparation part (replicate the scenario; get the flow in your head), to get to a point where you can start working the problem, takes a long time and is not much reusable: stoping work would imply having to repeat a lot of the preparation again when you came back to it (if time away was not long), or even doing it all over again (if time the away was longer, e.g. the next day/days).</div>

If so, then ignore what I am about to say and just carry on doing what you're doing..<br><br>If it's not,  then you will need to accept that some things will have to change. In which case my advice is: <br><br>a) split your longer tasks/projects up into shorter steps;<br><br>b) increase your speed so you get through your list at least once a day; <br><br>c) allow dismissal to reduce the number of tasks/projects you are actively working on.</div>

<div class="content">I think Hugo is describing my situation, if I understand properly.<br><br>When I am on this sort of project, the "problem" is that I struggle to work little & often, and I move very slowly through the list.<br><br>For me, this type of project describes a part of what I do. Some days, or stretches of days, it dominates. That's when I become one of the "crawlers." On days when I don't work one of these projects, I am a racer.<br><br>On these bigger projects, yes I am doing my job by getting the big things done. But meanwhile I am dropping the little things on the floor; and if there are no urgent little things floating around, then I am in constant anxiety that there might be.<br><br>SF promised to help (and does!) with its "little and often," but this type of project is the one that I am still struggling to learn to manage. One thing I've learned so far: when I get *stuck*, turn to SF instead of bashing against the wall. It is very helpful! But when I don't get stuck, I can easily blink to find it is 10:00pm, and then if I haven't seen the following pages of my list in a while, I get this vague feeling that I may have missed something.<br><br>I suppose time-boxing is in order for us then. I've been brainstorming on some approaches for next week.</div>

And I often wish that I could stand over someone's shoulder so I could tell them what they are doing wrong. >><br><br>It's a combination of many things that tends to make me crawl:<br><br>1. Lots of tasks.  SF seems to be topping out around 400-450 for me, with 25-30 active pages - currently it's in a down-trend since lots pages are getting dismissed the last couple days (C2 overload).  My speed feels pretty good generally -- but even with a good speed it can take some time to work through that many active pages.  <br><br>2. Heavy meetings 2-3 days per week -- limited discretionary time on those days.  Column 2 tends to get overloaded on those days, since I am not moving forward very quickly.  In a morning filled with meetings, I can't make any progress actioning a page, and just stay on that page.  Meanwhile the inflow of urgent items continues -- some of them generated by the meetings themselves, some of them just the usual occasional email that requires urgent action, and some of them triggered by recurring reminders.  These tend to pile up in Column 2 on the Next Page.  So even if I have an hour or two of discretionary time at lunchtime, it's maybe enough to clear through Column 2 of the Current Page and the Next Page, and maybe knock out a handful of Column 1 items in the process.  But then the rest of the day is filled with meetings again.  So, on these meeting-heavy days, there's just no time to move more than 2-3 pages (at most).<br><br>3. I have maybe 2 days per week with at least 4-6 hours of discretionary time, so I can make good progress on those days.  But I do usually have 1 or 2 largish projects in progress, and "little and often" typically means 20-60 minutes per iteration -- which means 20-60 minutes per page turn, just on those projects.  The most optimistic case would be 6 hours of discretionary time, and 20 minutes per iteration.  If I worked on absolutely nothing else, I'd get through 18 pages like this.   (Ie., working for 20 minutes at a time on this Column 2 task, then pushing the task forward to the next page.)   My current list has 21 active pages, so that's not even 1 cycle through the whole list.  And of course, other items DO stand out and require attention -- so on a good productive day I can typically get through 4-8 pages of my list, thus cycling through the whole thing once or twice a week.<br><br>4. On weekends I have a variable amount of time, usually devoted to home and family projects (all in the same SF list as my work tasks).  I usually have a lot of discretionary time but sometimes we are out all day and I don't have any time to work my list.  So the pattern is pretty similar to what I described above.<br><br><br>Anyway, Mark, does this answer your question on why this happens?<br><br>I have found it to be a big problem if I NEVER cycle through the list, always chasing the end, etc.  But for me, cycling through the list once or twice a week seems to be just fine.   It works great, gives me a good balance between "urgent" and "important", as well as between the easy one-offs and the harder, larger projects.</div>

But the dismissal mechanism is worthy of a Nobel prize.  Once you start getting the hang of dismissal, it increases the power of the system by an order of magnitude.</div>

And it does seem to help, almost magically in fact.  But after a bit I began to notice a growing tendency to neglect the weightier projects that need more sustained attention and thought.   I just couldn't "settle down" to spend 20-40 minutes on these larger tasks, since it would reduce my forward progress through the list.   I'd feel itchy and restless and couldn't really concentrate on the large task.   I'd try to convince myself that I was just trying to "clear the deck" of all the easy one-off tasks, and then I'd be able to concentrate on the larger tasks.

There are always trade-offs and we need to find the right balance between them that works best for our own situation.</div>

But on projects like Hugo's above, I find myself mentally figuring them, even talking them through to myself as I get the drink, and when I sit down again, I cannot stomach a page flip and having to work on some piddly thing that will stop all the gears in my mind. Those gears can take quite a while to restart!<br><br>I do have room for improvement in dismissal. Perhaps the answer is simply that I need to let more of those pages be dismissed when I am working a big project? I.e., when I come back from that drink, unless I see something truly trivial that I can do without stopping the gears (it would have to be as trivial as getting that drink--perhaps tossing out a piece of junk mail), then the page gets dismissed; so be it. By the end of my five hours, I am easily five pages lighter. I guess that would truly reflect the reality of that situation and allow the list to respond by pruning itself.<br><br>Besides getting a drink, there is also time-boxing to help us take predictable breaks in these projects. Breaks every 45 min. or so tend to help me; when I return I usually have better ideas even though I wasn't aware of being stuck or off track. But still any Col.1 tasks picked up in between would have to be *extremely* lightweight, and so I'd be dismissing quite a few pages. As I write this, I feel more and more definite that it solves my puzzle! <br><br>Am I getting warmer or colder? Thanks everyone for your help. I am finding this thread critical right now!</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>I meant "problem" in the sense of this thread, i.e. "cycling the list faster". <br><br>SF has been immensely helpful for all the other "stuff" both at my company (clients, paperwork, etc) and at home, but the bulk of those tasks are the kind where "little & often" fits like a glove: tasks where in the past I "didn't have time right now" end up being worked on and advancing because I can "just take the folder out". It's a great feeling. <br><br>But when I reach those "Big Rocks" on the list, progress stops to a halt and it can take days to advance a couple of pages. They are part of my job (and something I greatly enjoy) but running my (very small) company is also and during those times I worry that I might be droping the ball somewhere else on the list.</div>

<div class="content">Bernie,<br><br>Yes, I think you understood the situation perfectly :-)<br><br>Recently I segregated "errands", "calls" and "waiting" out of SF and into post-it notes in my notebook inside cover, and I like the way it streamlined the SF list. <br><br>Just thought that maybe moving this "Big Rocks" out and replacing with a "have time to focus?" on the list might help by knowing that when you return to the list it'll be streamlined and without tasks that standout to take half your day away. <br><br>This kind of segregation my also go well together with allocating time blocks for this long focused tasks (although time blocking hasn't worked well for me in the past). <br><br>I'm now trying the "Snooze SF3" tweak Mark mentioned in another thread, so I'll just see how this next week pans out with it in place.</div>

<div class="content">This is a general reply as too many people have made the same points to answer them individually:<br><br>1) If what you are doing produces the results you want, then it doesn't matter what speed you are moving at.<br><br>2) SF is a system for controlling discretionary time. If you don't have any discretionary time, then the system isn't going to work. The solution is to increase your discretionary time. There are many ways of doing this, but the place to start is the number of meetings you have.<br><br>3) I've never been a programmer so I don't know whether it's actually the case that taking a break means that you have to start again from scratch. It would be contrary to my experience in every other field of mental activity, where taking a break improves one's thinking. However if it is the case then I suggest that the best way forward is to take programming out of discretionary time and make it a scheduled activity.<br><br>4) If you don't follow the dismissal rules, you can forget about making SF work.</div>

<div class="content">On programming -- I used to think "little and often" didn't work for this.   But over the last couple of years I found that's just not quite true.  Both AF and SF have given me plenty of practice finding ways to mentally bookmark my programming work, so it's not so hard to stop and start up again.   And like Mark said, "taking a break improves one's thinking".<br><br>Programming can be like an addiction -- you develop some code, you try it out, it works but not quite, you tweak it, it works better but still not exactly what you want, you keep developing, keep tweaking, finally you are happy with the results.  This process gives you immediate feedback, but like a gambling addiction, the results are not 100% consistent.  So you keep developing, tweaking, testing till you get the results you want, but even when you're "done" it NEVER feels really perfect, you KNOW there are better ways to abstract the code into reusable modules, genericize it better so you can reuse the modules in other projects, etc.  And that keeps drawing you back.   <br><br>This process is perfectly descriptive of addictive behavior.<br><br>The best way to train a dog (so I've read) is to give it a reward for the desired behavior about 60% of the time.   This is actually far more effective than giving it a reward 100% of the time.  Programming is like that.  If you wrote some code and it always worked the first time, it would be mechanical and boring, rather than addictive.   <br><br>I only do some programming occasionally, in Perl or XML development or VB macros -- I'm not a full-time software developer, so maybe it's different for you full-time pros out there.   But AF / SF taught me that a really big part of the "programmer's high" when you feel like you are "in the zone" is really a kind of addiction, like I tried to describe above, and not a real working necessity.   AF/SF can help you get over that habit and work effectively doing "little and often".   I've found my code is actually done much faster and with better quality this way.   But then again, I'm not a full-timer so maybe it doesn't really apply...</div>

Having written code myself "in the trenches" for two decades, I still lapse into the feeling that, "I just can't take a break, it doesn't work like that." Yet, though the feeling is very real and consuming (and precisely as Seraphim describes), I find time and again that it pays to take a step back using some kind of time-boxing or other means of interruption. Not every 5 minutes, of course. But every 45 to 90 is very helpful. At my last programming job, our manager slyly coaxed regular breaks out of us by bringing in a ping-pong table.

<div class="content">Seraphim, you just described a good portion of my plan for next week.<br><br>I think the "time boxing" that doesn't work for you is what I'd call "scheduling." That is, designating a certain arbitrary time of day to do Project X. That is as unappealing to me as it seems to be to you. Its arbitrariness and pre-calculatedness is the exact opposite of SF's "standing out."<br><br>What I call "time boxing" is simply that I will set a timer when I start working one of these projects. This lets me survey the landscape *before* all the gears are turning, to estimate how long I can afford to get lost in the Project X time warp. Then I set the timer and allow myself to get lost in it. The hard part is taking the timer seriously when it rings. Naturally, if I get stuck before it rings, I can stop at any point and turn to SF.<br><br>I have time-boxed in the past, and it always runs great until I start disrespecting the timer. That's when it falls apart. The other problem is that feeling of "what now?" in between time boxes. Before SF, it wasn't always clear how to fit something gainful into those in-between times.<br><br>Btw, for any "Pomodoro" fans out there, my only objections to The Pomodoro Method are that the 25-minute box is just not long enough, and I don't want the entire day to be time-boxed. So you can think of this whole idea as modified Pomodoro, injected with performance-enhancing SuperFocus, if you want. Though to me, SF feels like the heart of the system.</div>

<div class="content">I've only dabbled in programming and novel writing, but I've definitely felt the heady, addictive rush that Seraphim describes, and how hard it is to get back into the flow after a break.<br><br>A good exercise is to push yourself as far out of "giant teetering house of cards" mode as possible.<br><br>Try to keep the house as small and stable as possible. Take a few moments to look at each card before you add it. Does it have to be added to that house right now, or can it sit in a stack on the side (written in a notebook)? Can you turn the house into a tidy, stable stack before going home?<br><br>Doing one card (or at least one room) at a time helps me focus. Rather than chasing threads all over the place, leaving half-debugged sections everywhere, I can do one smaller section at a time and actually finish them. Program flow and calculations are easier to read without all the error and exception checking, and can be done with a horrid user interface. I write a bare-bones routine that works, and make a note of what format the data needs to be in.<br><br>It's also easier to come back to a project if each room is small and stable. I can write a pretty data-input section and I don't have to remember a thing about the calculations to do it. Then I find the user can't give me the data I assumed, so at least I didn't waste time doing all that error and exception checking.<br><br>When binge programming, everything else falls down.

<div class="content">jFenter:<br><br>I've run plenty of things which require a similar degree of organising to a jazz club, and basically everything you mention would be documented so that you can pick it up as required. You don't wing the acts getting on stage at the right time - you have a timed schedule which you refer to. You don't "remember" who you advertised as the main show - it's written in your event folder. And the same goes for the seating capacity, the inventory of whiskey, and the meal ordering. So if interruptions happen (and they are inevitable) you can deal with them and get back to what you need to be doing with the minimum disruption.<br><br>So that leads to the question whether the problem that (some?/all?) programmers have picking up where they left off is due to their not documenting what they are doing.</div>

<div class="content">Speaking to the "programmer's house of cards":<br><br>This is an excellent image of what we go through, immersed in our software cubicles. I have built many a teetering monstrosity myself (including those delightful tours through Other People's Code), and I know all too well the grip that these structures naturally have on a programmer's mind. It feels as if I had better KEEP WORKING until it is 100% DONE, or I will never ever get all that detail back into my head without wasting precious hours. "Just write it down," they say? Bah! I will exhaust the company's supply of paper, and I wouldn't know where to start anyway, as I never took "Nineteen-dimensional diagramming 101" in college.<br><br>Despite all that, here is what I actually found when I began taking (forced!) breaks:<br><br>Taking notes on all my intricate ideas, it only took 5-10 minutes to capture enough information that I suddenly felt fine walking away from it. In fact, seeing just its major parts on paper turned out to be a relief, making the structure seem much less teetering and much less nineteen-dimensional—much less as if keeping track of it had anything to do with how soon I returned. Upon returning to my desk later, I found that various parts of my notes where (a) very effective reminders, (b) indecipherable, and (c) utterly silly. I would then proceed to recreate the entire house of cards in my head in a few more minutes, with fewer cards, placed much more effectively. My co-workers who gave it a try reported similar experiences. And we got really good at ping-pong.<br><br>If you haven't tried this, give it a week and see what happens. If it makes you three thousand percent less productive, tell your boss it's all my fault!  ;)  The ping-pong table is optional.</div>

<div class="content">I've been a programmer for almost 25 years now, so I thought I'd weigh in here.<br><br>Interestingly enough, I've found that programming is the one activity that I NEVER feel resistance to, and I that never have a hard time getting back in the "flow" with.  It doesn't matter if it's been hours, days, or weeks since I left whatever I was working on--all I have to do is stare at the code for a few minutes and everything comes flooding back (together with all of the new ideas that my brain has been processing in the meantime).<br><br>Perhaps it's due to good practices like test-driven development (the fun way to write unit tests) and "obsessive-compulsive refactoring."  I rather suspect, however, that my brain has some sort of reserved compartment for this kind of thing.  I can recall details of nearly every piece of code I've written or touched in the last two years (and I've noticed that this is not generally true among my colleagues).  When I have an active programming task, my mind is continually churning on it regardless of whatever else I might physically be doing or thinking about.<br><br>In contrast, an activity like writing is VERY hard for me to do "little and often" with.  If it's been more than an hour since I last touched a piece of prose, it can take forever for me to get back into context (20-30 minutes of hard work).  Working for 5-10 minutes only on a writing effort often produces zero forward progress.  Thus, an interruption when writing often means a day or more delay in finishing.  Hmmm . . .</div>

<div class="content">I've been buried with meetings lately - necessary meetings, but at a significant sacrifice of discretionary time.<br><br>So I invoked Trick #2 (see #2 in my first post at the top of this thread) -- "give yourself a time limit to get through each page".   I allowed 20 minutes per page.   I thought this would work pretty well since most of the pages were "mature" and didn't have many tasks left on them.<br><br>An interesting thing happened.   I was really behind in clearing my email, and that task got carried forward in Column 2 from page to page.   And I use the rule, "Clear Column 2 before starting on Column 1."<br><br>So, on every page, I would work on clearing my email.  And I would always get absorbed in it, not wanting to stop.   Pretty soon my timer would beep, and I had to move on to the next page.<br><br>But since I hadn't done any Column 1 tasks, I had to dismiss everything in Column 1.  I ended up dismissing about 300 tasks.   I only have about 120 tasks remaining.   My list feels so light and free!<br><br>I know there are a few tasks buried in those dismissed tasks that really do need to get done -- but I'll find them in the next day or two, and get them done.   It should be pretty easy to do, with only 120 tasks on my list.<br><br>In the process of doing this, I also realized that my "stalagmite/stalactite" method of processing work and personal tasks wasn't really working right.    I had been slowly realizing that the two different domains function at different speeds, at a different cadence.   Generally I have more discretionary time at work than at home, so as I cycled through my pages, my work tasks would get processed pretty fast, but my personal tasks would lag behind, mostly untouched.   Finally the pages would get dismissed, but the personal tasks really hadn't been processed enough to warrant dismissal.   It just felt wrong.   <br><br>My mass dismissals today really highlighted this issue and showed me what the problem was.   So, as I moved through the pages, I copied several personal tasks to a new "home" SF book, dismissed the rest, and from now on, I'll be using two different books.   I've been doing stalagmite/stalactite for so long that it may take some adjustment before I figure out how to work this way, but I'm looking forward to it.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:  The way I have handled the home/work context split is to use one notebook but turn it upside-down and back-to-front, so that the work tasks are at the front of the book and the home tasks are at the back but each are still written in a top-to-bottom, left-to-right manner.  The whole notebook is a stalactite-stalagmite pair, in other words.  This seems to work OK for me.  Switching context is just a question of flipping the book over.</div>
