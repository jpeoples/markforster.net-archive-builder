<div class="content">Because I needed it myself, and also for fun and maybe so that others could benefit from it too, I wrote yet another timer application. It's called MuuTimer and  can be downloaded here:<br><br><a href="http://klibb.com/pub/MuuTimer.zip" rel="nofollow">http://klibb.com/pub/MuuTimer.zip</a><br><br>Download. Unzip someplace and run the muutimer.exe file. By default you will get a five minute timer started.<br><br>It has various options. You can control the time, in seconds, minutes, or hours, by sending in parameters to it. You can set the action name and have that displayed in the title. You can turn ticking sound on or off and you can make the timer silent when it finish. You can change the finish sound by sending in a parameter. This allows for different sounds for different purposes (you can also change the sound files, of course, but the names needs to be like they are now, otherwise the application won't find anything to play). The idea is to make different shortcuts to the application with different options for different purposes. Check the readme.txt file for all available options.<br><br>The file is quite large, over 3 MB, but that is because it also includes the Python runtime, which the program needs to run. If you have Python installed already (typically if you are a GNU/Linux user), you can extract the actual script found in the src folder (it's only around 6 KB) and use that instead. Do not forget to copy the two wav files as well. It works quite well for me, but if there are any requests about simple functions to add I might to it.<br><br>I am very proud to say that the sounds are stolen :) The uh_oh2.wav sounds like it must be the old ICQ sound (don't know where I got if from), but I converted it to 16 bit. The tick sound was ripped from Andreas H's timer application.<br><br>Enjoy!<br></div>

<div class="content">So, it could count as a "performance" then and the "work" would be covered by copyright laws :)</div>
