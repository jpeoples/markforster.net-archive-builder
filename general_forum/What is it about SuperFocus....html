People were happily working with Autofocus well up to a year or more after it was first introduced.<br><br>But with SuperFocus, it seemed so powerful, such a great combination of simplicity and power, but after 6 months so many people have left it behind.<br><br>Is it like Mark wrote somewhere -- we're just too fed up with lists?<br><br>Or perhaps I am just presuming here, based on the most prolific posters here (and my own experience, too)?

<div class="content">very good question Seraphim for me the answer is clear <br>1. i am effectivly fed up with this kind of mixted list preferring having the control of project (gtd), the list versus af and the list versus context (gtd)<br>2. the system sf was good but exhausting , at the end of the day i noticed i had activities and lot of things done but i did not advance on my projects. Not enough<br>sf was in fact perfect if i had no too many items, but it drove me crazy when i had so many tasks. <br><br>this is the reason why even if i prefer paper and find mf system indeed great i kept what i thought the best of it and adapted it digitly with omnifocus. <br>Sure this wont please many but it was the only way i found to stay on the flow...</div>

<div class="content">+JMJ+<br><br>Seraphim, <br><br>I have mentioned quite a few times my views on the weaknesses of SuperFocus.  And the thing is, I think that is the problem: ALL systems have weaknesses.<br><br>I think what has happened is that, as you've said, we have all been jaded by our experiences with the different autofoci.  Each and every time an AF version appeared we all get hyped and excited that THIS is the perfect system, and yet after a few months reality had caught up with the hype and we abandon the system.  This happened to us for a few times more until SFv.3 came up and, well, we were not so hyped up anymore, we had become more cautious in the light of the experiences we had in the previous systems: we had a more cynical view on SFv.3 than with the previous systems.  Thus, we had become less blind, probably subconsciously, with its defects and we were able to point out to ourselves and others the deficiencies of SF faster and thus we abandoned the system faster than before.<br><br>This is now the reason why I had said in another thread that there is no perfect system for everyone but there could be a perfect system for each and everyone of us, provided we can incorporate what we need in the time management system and accept the weaknesses of the system that we can actually handle.<br><br>God bless.</div>

<div class="content">C2.<br><br>For me the complexity of implementing C2 in a digital realm killed it for me. No matter what I tried it was awkward. A secondary factor was that I disliked that "must clear c2 rule". It was higher pressure than I liked. These motivated me to find something like SuperFocus where these objections weren't there.</div>

<div class="content">+JMJ+<br><br>Alan: <<C2>><br><br>Yep! C2 is also my specific "beef" with SF. It is SF's answer to AF1's weakness in handling urgent tasks, but for me it also neutralized AF1's strength of having a series of closed lists.  In AF1, each page essentially becomes a closed list which has a definite limit in size that constantly lessens in size per pass.  In SF, C2 essentially made each page its own open list that can increase in size per pass.   Not conducive for work, IMHO.<br><br>God bless.</div>

<div class="content">The only reason I stopped using SF is that I began following the "Dreams" process, in which a prime mandate is "I will do it when I feel like it and not before." (Of course, this must go hand-in-hand with the vision work to avoid Drifting.)<br><br>I had come to SFv3 fresh, with no prior AF experience, and I thought it was really excellent. Mark remarked in another thread that he had hoped SF would result in a vision effectively emerging, through the "sifting" process if I understood him correctly. And I felt he very nearly succeeded with that. I always felt like it was just missing some subtle ingredient to make it really perfect, and of course each variation promised to be It.<br><br>As for the C2 troubles, of course that was the central challenge. There was so much more potential, though, even in canonical SFv3 than many of us were using. Think of how every task was "finished" according to how you phrased it, or even according to any convention you might decide to adopt when reading it. I came to take "do a little bit of X" as my convention for anything written in C2, and this went a long way toward relieving the pressure. This can be a double-edged sword, true, but one could sharply change the dynamics just by changing these conventions, and there you have a whole host of variations inside the standard canonical version without any actual rule changes. In another thread, someone reported on writing "review recent pages for urgencies" when he got overwhelmed. The rules don't tell you to review recent pages, but they do tell you to do *whatever* you've written in C2. Potential, people! Untapped!!<br><br>But there is another edge to that sword: since SF is all based on how you word things, it is also thus based on your own concepts and limitations about tasks and management.<br><br>For instance, in the middle of my SF experience, I read Mark's DIT book, and I learned for the first time that there is such a thing as "one day's work." This was phenomenal! E-mail ceased to be a black hole. I found a simple folder structure that kept today's incoming mail separate from my active/pending items, separate from my backlog, and then this affected the meaning of "email" on my SF list. "Email" came to mean "do one day's worth of email today." What a concept!! It would start in C1, then live in C2 for a while, and then back to C1 until tomorrow. This had nothing to do with SF, yet it was an SF turbocharge. Had I never learned the DIT concept, I might still be saying "SF gets really bogged down by email ..."<br><br>SF is truly a brilliant invention, and perhaps v3 is like Edison's proverbial 9,999th light bulb filament, the penultimate variation. Even if I never return to that canonical system, the lessons I learned from using it will power anything else I come up with. Its principles (such as little & often, and closed lists, "chuck anything at it," the whole lot taught in DIT) are eternal. Any system that manifests these principles will be good, and the one that manifests them just right for you will be wonderful if not perfect.<br><br>In the "Dreams" world, I am gradually settling on something SF-like, very different in outward form but much the same underneath. Of course, I can move items all over at will ("when I feel like it"), but it keeps my place in the big things while offering up a stream of little things.<br><br>It is beginning to *feel* like SuperFocus, and that is a very good feeling. If only I can figure out how to merge it with my "dashboard," I'll have it made!</div>

<div class="content">I'm still on SF, digitally using my ViewPad7 Android device.<br><br>I agree with Alan that "C2" is a pain to implement digitally. For much of last month I don't have much more than 1 C2 a day in the list. Many other urgent stuff just get done outside of SF time, and not go into C2 at all.<br><br>Like Bernie my default convention is "Do a little bit of X" or sometimes "Do enough of X", and that does take some of the overpowering C2 pressure off me.<br><br>I've just added task  "Try ABCS" aka Alan Baljeu's Current System, at the end of my open list. Lets see when that stands out. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">After two years of (mostly) AF1, I switched to SF early this year and am still using it. But I also had problems with the compulsory nature of C2. So I slightly changed the way I use C2, to bring back the feel and flow of AF1 (my all time favourite system until the advent of SF), while retaining the SF advantage of having a standard way to handle urgent items.<br><br>This is achieved mostly through the way I re-enter unfinished tasks: not automatically in C2, but in C1 (AF1-like) unless it's what I call a "fast track" item, meaning it's urgent that I continue progressing on it. This relieves most of the pressure and resistance of C2 and keeps its advantages.<br><br>I described my use of SF here:<br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1474036" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1474036</a><br><br>As a result, my C2 column is not as heavily used as in the past, it can contain as few as 2 items and rarely exceeds one third of the page (my pages have 33 lines).</div>

<div class="content">I'm still using SF, but I'm using one of Mark's variations... I can't remember which number it was... the one where urgent tasks go to C2 on the next page once you've started on C1, and C2 tasks can be demoted back to C1 of the last page if they don't stand out.<br><br>I'm digital using ToDo and before that I was digital using Toodledo.

We have at least two parts. In the _Dreams_ book the parts are called conscious and unconscious. So, there is no coherent “I” to do things when “it” (they?) feels like it. What is called “I” is actually a complex of selves. When all the selves agree, it is easy to do things. The difficulty arises when some selves are for and others against the same thing. Does the “I” “feel” like it or not? When we drill down to the level of the component selves, some of them will feel pushed, and others pulled.<br><br>So, what I have been doing is writing my Future Reality, writing what Went Better, writing Self-Coaching dialogues, while all the time using my version of SF. So, you could say that I push myself with SF and pull myself with _Dreams_.<br><br>As to my version of SF, I use C2 as my urgent safety valve. I don’t worry about “finished” or “unfinished” status. The item “email” always means for me, “do something with my email.” I am a firm believer in “little and often.” If I tell myself I “must” finish, I cannot tell my same self the little lies that make little and often so effective (“I won’t do all my email, just the first one or two.”)<br><br>Also, I have a few things that I almost always do at the very beginning of my workday. So, no matter where I left off SF the night before, I always start the new day in SF at the location where this morning tasks are located.<br><br>Also, I did DWM for so long, that I developed the habit of not letting things become more than a week old. I have tried to continue this in SF. Occasionally I fall a day or two behind. But when I see a page or two that are older than a week, I make an extra effort to clear them.</div>

Will the energy to do this come "for free," or will I have to claw my way through it?<br><br>Using SuperFocus, my Pull often came from C1, when something new and shiny stood out. whereas the Push was apt to come from C2, where some stale thing had got stuck there unfinished, or an urgent thing had to be done no matter what I thought of it. Of course, in-progress C2 items enjoyed Pull for a while too, and with any luck they got finished before going stale.<br><br>What kept me coming back to SuperFocus was the experience of getting a whole day's energy for free. Managing C2 wisely, this experience was quite accessible. All I had to do was stop a task when I felt Push coming on, copy it forward to the appropriate page/column, and switch to anything that stood out. There was usually *something* standing out! Later on, the same task that had fallen into Push would create a feeling of Pull again, and I would continue.<br><br>The only drawback was that without a Vision guiding this process, I did tend to fill my list with the daily little things while looking past the various unattended elephants in the room.

<div class="content">You know, I really don't think there is a fundamental flaw with SuperFocus.  What I'm using now is really little more than an altered form-factor to the same premise: write stuff in a series of closed pages; alternate between urgent/unfinished stuff and other stuff; scan through the list for inspiration.  <br><br><<Do I have energy for this or not? Will the energy to do this come "for free," or will I have to claw my way through it?>><br>One awesome experience with AF is such as today, where I felt not much energy to do anything, but I tiredly scanned the list and found a task which really needed to be done, and I found a pocket of energy to make it happen.  <br><br>Unfortunately for SF, its "must do" mentality would have defeated me today, and I would have dropped the list.  The no-pressure system let me get drawn into a task rather than feel pushed into it.<br><br><<The only drawback was that without a Vision guiding this process, I did tend to fill my list with the daily little things while looking past the various unattended elephants in the room. That has changed dramatically since I took up "Dreams.">> <br><br>This recalls to mind the problem of how to eat a herd of elephants.  As I recall, it's quite daunting, and you'd be well advised to dismiss some of that herd.  Getting a clear vision does exactly that.</div>

<div class="content">There seems to be a consensus that those who dropped SF, did so because of the compulsory nature of C2.<br><br>And those who keep using SF, are successful because they have modified the compulsory nature of C2, using it as a "fast track" as Marc from Brussels describes.<br><br>That's pretty much what I've been doing, too, but with a different form factor.  At home, I'm using a series of accordion folders that sit on a shelf.  Each folder is equivalent to a "page" in SF.  I have a red "hot folder" that works like C2, and also serves as a "bookmark" for where I am on the shelf.  <br><br>First I take down my Hot folder, and work on whatever needs attention (but not ALL of it, as SF would normally have me do).  <br><br>Then I put the Hot folder back on the shelf, and take down the next folder.   I work on whatever I want in that folder.   <br><br>If I am not done with the item, then I have a couple choices.  If the item is "hot", then I put it into my "Hot" folder so it gets "fast track attention".   If the item is "normal", then I put it in the last accordion folder on my shelf.  <br><br>Items that don't get worked on, stay in the folder. <br><br>When I'm done working on things in that folder, it goes back on the shelf in the same place where it was.  If I worked on NOTHING in that folder, then I dismiss that folder by putting it in a box under my desk.  I periodically purge that box.<br><br>Then I move on to the "Hot folder" again.  And then the next folder on the shelf.  Then the hot folder again.  And so on, through all the folders on the shelf.  Then I start again from the beginning.<br><br>When I have a new task, I write it on a scrap of paper and have two choices.  If it's "hot", then it goes in my hot folder.   Otherwise, it goes in the last accordion file on the shelf.   (Just like SF.)<br><br>One thing I really like:  I can put whatever I want in my folders -- not just written lists of tasks.  For example, rather than writing "Journal" on a list, I just put my actual journal on the shelf.<br><br>Likewise, it's really easy to handle mail and other incoming paper.  I scan through it.  I put the hot items in my hot folder.   The rest goes into the last folder on the shelf.  It gets processed just like everything else.<br><br>Books can also just go on the shelf with everything else -- as long as I don't put too many on the shelf at once.<br><br>Also, it's easy to group things into "projects".  I just add another folder on the shelf for any new projects that come up.  The project folder gets processed just like any other folder.  So, it gets frequent attention, and I also am prompted to look through all the project papers and details -- rather than just seeing "Project X" on a  list, which would never stand out for me.<br><br>When I go to work, I take my hot folder with me in my backpack, and maybe one or two project folders.  At lunchtime I can go through them and deal with anything like phone calls or whatever that need attention.   When I get back home, the folders go back in their place on the shelf.<br><br>I carry around some notecards in my pocket, and jot down new items as they come up.  When I get home, I put them in the folder.  <br><br>One nice thing is that I can visually SEE how much work I have.  If the shelf starts getting full, it's time to get serious about dismissal and/or pruning.  <br><br>It's nice having my journal on the shelf.  This is where I like to think over things and write out my ideas and goals, as well as retrospective and self-corrective kinds of pondering.  <br><br>I've been doing this about two weeks now and am really enjoying it.   The one gap is really feeling happy with the way my personal email is worked into this. <br><br>At work, almost everything is electronic, so I set up something very similar in OneNote - borrowing many ideas from Alan.  <br> <br><br>Anyway, back to the main point -- this is very much like SF but without the compulsory nature of C2.  It's even more tactile than a written list.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim: That is a doubly excellent post!  <br>A very incisive summary of everyone's take on SF. I'm strongly inclined to review all these posts as it seems there is a core agreement of both problem and the nature of a solution. I think a fundamental solution lurks here. <br><br> And that is an extremely interesting folder system there. I'm very tempted to try it. Both the use of fOlders on its own is neat, and the prOcessing rules seem like this may be generally valuable.</div>

<div class="content">Still using Sf3. Works so good I haven't been compelled to frequent here nearly as much. Like the others I relax C2 giving an item 3 minutes thought is sometimes sufficient to move it to the next page. Sometimes the next action on an item is to decide to demote it to C1 and move on.  I also use pencil not pen. That way when I put it into the wrong column because I am not thinking clearly then I can move it later and fix the mistake. <br><br>Still in search for an e-solution.

<div class="content">I'm thinking of producing a new version of the SuperFocus rules. Basically it would be :<br><br>1) Urgent and unfinished tasks both entered on next page's C2.<br><br>2) C1 and C2 worked together as part of the same page.<br><br>3) Any C2 tasks left undone transferred to C1 of last page.<br><br>4) Dismissal or C1 as in AutoFocus (i.e. only if no tasks worked on during a visit to a page)<br><br>For me this goes very nicely with the Dreams technology. I think this is the point that I have only just picked up - that AF/SF essentially work on "Pull" and can therefore be used to give the necessary organisation to Dreams.</div>

This keeps a strong focus on completing the C2 items.<br>- I always retain the right to demote any C2 item back to C1 - re-enter in C1 of last page - when it just doesn't make sense to keep an item in C2 any more. Maybe it will get re-promoted sometime.<br>- I also always retain the right to copy any C2 item forward to the next page if I want to keep giving it high attention but just can't take action on it right now for some reason.<br>- I try to apply the same rigor to the last two items that I would to re-instating a dismissed item -- i.e., there must be a very good reason why I am exercising my right to demote or to copy forward."</div>

If SF were a bicycle, I was still riding with training wheels, and some of your techniques were a bit like "leaning into the turn"—beyond me for the time being.

<div class="content">Mark, it's good to hear that you have more ideas bubbling up on AF and SF.  I like the idea of making C2 unrelated to a particular page.  I've recently had a series of family crises which are still ongoing, and although I haven't been able to spend a lot of time on SF, opening up my SF notebook to check that I haven't forgotten anything vital has been a very soothing experience in the midst of the storm.  I've also started to re-read my original copy of 'Dreams' and am excited by that, but I was a bit worried about how, or whether, to combine it with SF.  It sounds like you may have an answer to that.  Thanks again for all your brilliant work.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><<The other is making C2 unrelated to a particular page.>><br><br>I hope this idea leads you somewhere good! Part of the tyranny of C2 is dictating a strict rotation through the active items. A much nicer C2 would allow, say, alternating between two top tasks for a while, then picking up a little thing from C1, then hitting a third C2 task, then a little more attention to the first C2 task, and then maybe some work on the fourth C2, etc.<br><br>By then, maybe one of the C2's is finished, and one would feel like turning the page for a new C1, while continuing to whittle away the remaining three C2 entries. One could stay in Pull Mode for a loooong time like this!<br><br>When I've had more than two or three C2 items, I've tended to do this informally by not turning the page until I've had a satisfactory free-for-all around the whole thing. I've ended up with those "heavy dots" on half a dozen tasks at a time. The only bad thing about it was that it slowed down my progress through the list.<br><br>Lately (following "Dreams"), I've played with a "detached C2" on a few busy days, where I've simply written the urgent/unfinished on a separate page where I work any task at any time, while working through the notebook (C1) in parallel. Those experiments felt good, but I didn't devise a framework for continuing day to day. Instead, I threw away the spare page when everything was done, and often the following day would not be busy enough to require another page or even to use the notebook at all.<br><br>The simplest detached C2 would be a second AF notebook, kept alongside the first, with pages turned independently, though I've never tried it.<br><br>Well, good luck with a "C2 unrelated to a particular page." I am excited to see where your keen sense of design takes that concept!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Alan <br><br>"What is AF5 ? is it superfocus with the new rul MF is testing ie<br><br>1) Urgent and unfinished tasks both entered on next page's C2.<br>2) C1 and C2 worked together as part of the same page.<br>3) Any C2 tasks left undone transferred to C1 of last page.<br>4) Dismissal or C1 as in AutoFocus (i.e. only if no tasks worked on during a visit to a page)<br><br>For me this goes very nicely with the Dreams technology. I think this is the point that I have only just picked up - that AF/SF essentially work on "Pull" and can therefore be used to give the necessary organisation to Dreams."<br><br>Thanks</div>

<div class="content">A simple approach to a detached C2 in a paper based system that keeps C2 'in your face' is to do one or both of the following:<br><br>1) Cut several pages  (say 5-10) in half (or for more main working space, cut 40 off) vertically. This is your c1, and then keep 2 or 3 pages after as full pages of which only the right column c2 will be visible at all times.  Now you have a detached c2. Can repeat this sequence for rest of notebook.<br><br>2) Fold instead of cutting as above.  (This works, but in testing, cutting works better)<br><br>and for maintenance, whenever need to dismiss or move past a c2, then just fold it over.<br><br>Can vary the number of pages set for c1 and c2 every batch of pages to have enough to move through.<br><br>Just another thought of how to use standard paper based notebook form with another dimension.</div>

<div class="content">With loose pages several good ways exist to manage bookmarks:<br>- use a divider and move pages to before / after the divider<br>- use the front and back pages as the active page.<br>- as Seraphim suggests, move the desired page after the current page.<br>With fixed pages (or loose)<br>- Use two tabs <br><br>But I gave up on loose pages some months ago and returned to a conventional spiral-bound notebook.  t was only because there wasn't a pleasant way of physically interacting with the floating pages.  It's quite the opposite in OneNote where moving stuff is completely natural.<br><br>I tried a binder before with this idea, and it was too clunky moving pages.  I tried a portfolio folder, with loose pages, and it worked smoothly enough, but just had that unsatisfactory feeling with pages floating, shifting, never perfectly aligned.I never tried folders, but I don't have a lot of objects and pages of stuff to put into them, so I fear it would dissolve into one folder one page.  Although I do have a bunch of lists that might fit well... and I do have a nice wire folder holder....</div>

<div class="content">Alan - I agree with you, personally the loose-leaf notebook form factor never worked for me, either.   It's too clunky to move things around.   And it's too bulky to carry around conveniently.<br><br>The accordion files work great for me for personal stuff, and OneNote works great at work, both following essentially the same process.<br><br>With OneNote, I thought I'd lose some key dynamic unless I counted an exact number of items to go into each OneNote section -- just like in SF, you have a specific, set number of lines per page.    But this time around, I have abandoned that.   Instead, I gather all new items into my "Unfiled Notes", which links to a section in my "SF" notebook.  Every time I cycle through the sections in the SF notebook, I process the Unfiled stuff.   Some of it gets actioned immediately, some of it gets moved to my Hot folder, some of it is deleted.   If anything is left, I create a new section, put today's date on it, and put all the leftover new stuff into that section.   Sometimes it's 3 items, sometimes its 50 items.  It doesn't seem to really matter.  What *does* matter is that it's now a "closed list" and it gets repeated attention every time I cycle through the list.</div>
