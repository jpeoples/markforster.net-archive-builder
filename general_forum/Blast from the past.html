<div class="content">I'm still using a filofax - have had one of each size over the years but have now settled on an A5 version in pink leather - what else!).  Have to say the paper is jolly good quality if you like to use a fountain pen like me.</div>

<div class="content">I use a really slim filofax which easily fits in my suit pocket. Works well for me.</div>

<div class="content">Yes, I have to admit that a pen on good paper is wonderful.<br><br>I'm retaining my moleskine medium notebook for NON DWM stuff, eg meetings, thinking about things, until Asus, Lenovo, preferably Toshiba, comes out with 9" or 10." tablet netbook on which I can write with a stylus/pen, not just a touch screen for moving photos etc around.<br><br>In the meantime I'm staying with ListPro printed on one A4 sheet which I use during the day with a proper pen.</div>

<div class="content">For a long while I abandoned paper for a total Palm setup.  About three years back I realised that I spent more time tweaking my setup than doing stuff and went completely analogue.  Good decision for me.<br><br>Re paper: As I like writing with a fountain pen I've switched from Moleskine to Clairefontaine or Rhodia which have much higher quality paper and no bleed.<br><br>Re tablet: have you considered the interactive eReaders that are around now?</div>

<div class="content">Regarding paper quality - I find the filofax quality excellent with my fountain pens.  That is one thing they seem to have retained.</div>

<div class="content">Simon:<br><br>I want a tablet/slate/e-reader whatever that I can write on.  I think the functionality required is being lost among the labels for these devices.<br><br>For me, writing on the is the main thing, reading books/newspapers etc is secondary, for others the latter is more important.  I see the tablet as a productive tool, not an infotainment (dreadful word!) device.</div>
