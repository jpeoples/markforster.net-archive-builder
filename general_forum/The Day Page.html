<div class="content">David Coyer asked about my Day Page, so here is a sample: https://postimg.cc/MvLWcbFS.<br><br>(I have the strangest feeling that I posted one of these a few years ago, but I’m not sure, and it’s probably evolved anyway.)<br><br>I start these pages on the last page of a notebook, so that each day’s page ends up on top of the previous day’s, and I can easily peek under for reference and copy-overs. In the front of the notebook (not shown), going in the conventional forward direction, I keep a running shopping/errand list. This one notebook, then, is all I need when driving anywhere, telling me when I need to be where and what my options are for ad-hoc shopping or walk-in tasks. If I anticipate having a work session (waiting for car service?), I also bring the Long List notebook.<br><br>On this hypothetical day, I want to first remember to take out the trash, so I wrote that in the night before. I probably also wrote my car service appointment the night before, and the reminder that my phone call to the insurance company would fit in nicely while I am waiting for the car—only because that idea came to me while writing the list, otherwise I would have left the space blank.<br><br>The rest of the left-hand column I might have written also the night before or in the morning right after taking out the trash. I am going to my daughter’s high school for a basketball game that starts at 6p, so I had better leave work by 5:30p, and on the way, I need to pick up the dry cleaning. In the evening, I want to remind “S” to confirm the travel dates of her high school trip next month, because we got conflicting emails about it.<br><br>Some of these items may be on my electronic calendar(s), some may be on sticky notes people have stuck to my desk, and maybe I caught a glimpse of the dry cleaning stub by my phone and said, “Oh, yeah…” but now they are all together on a surface that will be exposed to me continuously all day.<br><br>On the right side, I jotted down the first three things on my mind in the morning: complete that application for a work seminar, review the budget, and check on the exterior painting that was supposedly done yesterday—it’s getting dark early, so when I got home yesterday, I couldn’t see well enough to check.<br><br>Once I got to working, I wanted to dig in to the application, but I had a nagging feeling about things on my Long List, so first I wrote “LL session” and dotted it, and after spending enough time on the LL to be no longer worried about it, I crossed it out and dotted the application (top item on the right) to work on.<br><br>I got a few pages of the application done, so I crossed it out and rewrote it at the bottom, and I switched to the budget review: second item on the right, dotted it, then crossed it out and rewrote it at bottom. At this point, I decided on another Long List session, and towards the end of that, my dad called and left voice mail. Since I felt like I was about done with the Long List at that point and unlikely to work my way back to the open page, I wrote his call on my Day Page instead. This could have gone on either list, whatever would have felt smoothest at the time.<br><br>The application and budget review also could have gone on the Long List instead of the Day Page. It just depends whether they are on my mind when I’m going over the Day Page in the morning. Again, it doesn’t really matter, and I’m not trying to make up a rule about it. All I need is a frictionless way to get it off my mind in a way that feels secure. Maybe I know it’s on my Long List, but I’m not sure how far back, and I can already feel myself worrying about whether I’ll hit it before something else distracts me… write it on the Day Page, done, get going.<br><br>It looks like I forgot to check the paint job as I was leaving the house! Oh well, I’ll copy it to tomorrow’s left column, as I did for this morning’s trash, and try again.</div>

<div class="content">Looks like you finally found your long-elusive dashboard?</div>

<div class="content">Yes, thanks! It's a great short-term dashboard.<br><br>For a long-term dashboard, I am still evolving the Analog Kanban, which has become much simpler. It's still a bit clunky, and I actually resist looking at it, but it is way past the better-than-nothing stage and is definitely providing some value.</div>

<div class="content">That sounds a lot like my Week Page. One Page to Rule Them All really does make a difference. I find that with Day Pages I get too optimistic, writing all the LAO things I hope to do but rarely end up doing. Also, I copy things from the LL to the Week Page, rather than going back to the LL during the week. The LL is distracting, and if the week goes badly, it's nice to know I can safely ignore it.<br><br>My Week Pages automatically join the Long List when the week ends. That saves copying.<br><br>Absolutely agree with not agonizing whether it goes on the Long List or Day Page. It's ok to write things on the Day Page, even if they're still in the Long List, and even if it won't be done today. It's better for something to be on several lists than no lists. More-current list is safer. If you see it, you can demote it.<br><br>I've played with Month Pages, but haven't found a way that works for me.</div>

<div class="content">Cricket,<br><br>I like the idea of a Week Page onto which I copy things from a longer list and then don't have to look at the list, but for the usual multitude of small tasks, a week has always been way too abstract of a time interval for me. It's like guessing how many paper clips can fit into a bath tub. I can estimate how many milk jugs will fit in a bath tub, but not paper clips!</div>

<div class="content">When I have an actual job, yeah, a week is too large. It's a nice intermediate step, though. It's a nice size for seeing upcoming problems. (Three big projects due Friday, need to work on one, any one, today.) When setting up for today you only have to go to it and the day pages between then and now.</div>

<div class="content">Just saw that Getting S@#$t Done, GSD, is rebranding to Ziiplist.com . That uses a Day Page.</div>
