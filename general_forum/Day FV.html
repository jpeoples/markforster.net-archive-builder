<div class="content">I had a good run with 5T, but I already new that that system is perfect for me.<br><br>So I checked out the other No List systems, re-read the chapter on 5T in Mark's book "Secrets…", which is amazing, you should read it; and found "Day FVP" interesting.<br><br>Then Mark posted his newest blog. Intriguing.<br><br>I thought about all this and said to myselves: If day FVP is a valid no list system, then day FV is it as well.<br><br>So I started it.</div>

<div class="content">It's a mixed bag. The working itself flows quite well. I seem to get more different stuff done than with 5T and work a bit "faster." (Not at the cost of doing the "important", btw.)<br><br>(Reminds me of what Mark said about his experience with Fast Autofocus.)<br><br>I stutter, however, in terms of adding tasks to the list. Since it's a daily list, I can't "find" tasks "laying around", but OTOH there is no prompt for entering new tasks as with other No List approaches.<br><br>There is a tendency towards having a daily template. The whole thing feels DITish to me.</div>

<div class="content">Christopher:<br><br>With day lists the secret is to start off relatively small and add stuff to your list as you go through the day, aiming never to put on more than you are confident you can finish by the end of the day.</div>

<div class="content">Great tips there Mark! Something I have found helpful with a day list is using Outlook Tasks for a lot of incoming tasks (especially emails). I can then just have 'outlook tasks work' on my list for that day. <br><br>This stops the need for literally have 30 plus tasks written on my list on work days. <br><br>I also use a checklist in the back of my notebook ('more or less daily' and 'periodic' with a vertical dividing line between the two categories). <br><br>I also use the same notebook for notes. Works well so far!</div>
