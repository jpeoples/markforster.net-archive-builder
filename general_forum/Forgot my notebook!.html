<div class="content">This is the only place where my distressed wail will not fall on deaf ears.<br><br>I left my DWM list at home today!!!!!!!<br><br>I easily recreated a list with the things that were to expire today (3 things) and the things that I know have to happen today.  But I feel like I'm missing a limb.<br><br>Clearly I need a smartphone so I can do this electronically.  (Electronic isn't practical for me otherwise because I combine work and home lists and don't have a computer up & running all the time at home, or when I'm out.)</div>

<div class="content">Today I'm doing a mini-review.  I've need to update my list and I have it "mostly" reflected in Toodledo.  I was fretting about printing the list so I could reconcile my master list in my book.... then I realized that all I had to do was switch on my iPhone.  Damn, that's nice ;-)<br><br>In your case, you could just point your browser at Toodledo and you'd have it.</div>

<div class="content">Yeah, more and more I'm wishing I could go electronic  - DWM is the first of Mark's systems that screamed "electronic!" to me.  But I'm not at a computer ALL the time, so that becomes less practical for the home side of things (and without the list I would NEVER remember to move the laundry to the dryer before it gets stinky from sitting in the washer too long).</div>

<div class="content">Sarah:<br> <br>I spend quite a bit of time at my computer, BUT my electronic list is printed at the beginning of the day after the first email session in case anything worthwhile has arrived overnight.<br><br>I then work from the printed list,adding new tasks via pen, then in the evening I update the electronic version.  So at least I have a fairly current copy with me.<br><br>If I do lose the paper list, I only lose any manual entries, strikethroughs etc, because my Windows Mobile has ListPro as well and synchs with my main computer's ListPro.  Like your current list, mine contains work and home/personal tasks.</div>
