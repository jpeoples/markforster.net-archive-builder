<div class="content">I seem to remember Mark recommending checking your mood at regular intervals and scoring it, so to speak, as a way of actually improving your mood. In that connection, I thought some here might be interested to know about this site:<br><br><a href="http://www.moodscope.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.moodscope.com/</a><br><br>It's a nice way of tracking on your mood on a daily basis, based on the widely-used PANAS scale, and it adds the option of automatically sharing your daily scores with friends via email.</div>

<div class="content">I mention this in "Do It Tomorrow", but I also wrote an article about it at:<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2006/9/17/feeling-good.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2006/9/17/feeling-good.html</a><br><br>I scored 76% today on the Moodscope evaluation, which is quite a bit more complicated than the very simple method I recommended, and is only done once a day. I'll be interested to see whether I feel it is more or less effective than my way.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the references, Mark.<br><br>One significant difference is that Moodscope makes it easy to share your scores with friends and the like (if you choose to, and they agree to receive them). And there's evidence that that can make a difference. <br><br>Anyway, hope you, and others, get something out of it.</div>

<div class="content">Scored 84% today, so it's obviously working!<br><br>The first thing I notice is that it's making finer distinctions than my method. Using my method, I would have graded myself "10" both yesterday and today. Whether this is actually valuable or not we wait to see.</div>

<div class="content">For those who really want to get into "personal informatics" (<a href="http://personalinformatics.org/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://personalinformatics.org/</a> ), there's an app called Optimism: <a href="http://www.findingoptimism.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.findingoptimism.com/</a>  , runnable on most platforms.<br><br>It's focus is on helping the user isolate triggers that affect mental health.</div>

<div class="content">So you're feeling perkier today?</div>

<div class="content">Funnily enough perkiness seems to be missing from the PANAS scale:<br><br><a href="http://www.midus.wisc.edu/midus2/project5/M2_P5_Positive%20and%20Negative%20Affect%20Scale_general.pdf" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.midus.wisc.edu/midus2/project5/M2_P5_Positive%20and%20Negative%20Affect%20Scale_general.pdf</a></div>

<div class="content">Down to 96% today, because I was only "quite a bit excited" instead of "extremely excited".<br><br>Why do they consider being "extremely excited" all the time to be desirable?</div>

<div class="content">I'm finding this aggregate scoring not very helpful. It's mostly the same, but the site is going "oh no you're down 8%!  Better stage an intervention!". And really I'm not much different day to day. I was hoping for more specific analysis based on linked variables or something.</div>

<div class="content">Alan:<br><br>I agree.  I don't think this actually tells me much. The only variation I get is with things I don't agree are part of a good mood anyway, such as being "extremely excited". <br><br>It might be useful for people who are depressed or have very variable moods, but I actually think my simple method is more useful for most people to use.</div>

<div class="content">I skipped yesterday as it would have been just more of the same, but after an extremely frustrating day today struggling to get a new broadband system installed I thought I'd take it again.<br><br>Result: 49% (and that's _after_ I successfully resolved the problem!)<br><br>I just checked with my own simpler method and got a 4 (out of 10)</div>

<div class="content">Back to 84%. Ten in my method.<br><br>I think that's as far as I'm going with this.</div>

<div class="content">An interesting follow-up question to "How good do I feel?" is "What stops it being lower?" (shifting your attention to what's working).</div>

<div class="content">I've done these kinds of surveys manually in the past and I found them useful.<br><br>But this one annoyed me. After the third day the system was generating truly inane comments. I know that I could just choose to ignore the comments. But I was unable to resist seeing what it was "saying" about me.<br><br>I think I would be better off using the manual survey again, if I felt the need. I am perfectly capable of tracking my scores for the manual survey.</div>

<div class="content">moises:<br><br>I also found the interface annoying and time-wasting - all those revolving cards - which could in itself affect one's scores!<br><br>I could have filled in a simple tick box chart about five times faster.</div>

<div class="content">Just a couple of quick words in defence of the apparently unpopular Moodscope: <br><br>First, there's apparently some empirical evidence that the playing cards approach generates more accurate results than something more like a checkbox approach precisely because it slows you down. <br><br>Second, I agree that the list of mood aspects has some odd features (like pairs which seems awfully close to redundant), but again, it's worth noting that the list is a very widely-used scale for measuring mood which has been subjected to significant empirical testing by research psychologists. I'm not suggesting that this means it must be unproblematic, but I do think it means that it's too hasty to write it off on the basis of one's own intuitionsâ€”our intuitions can be very unreliable in this sort of area.<br><br>Third, one of the main features of Moodscope is the way it automates the process of sharing your daily scores with a friend; and again, there's apparently empirical evidence that that in itself can be beneficial. So this should be taken into account when comparing it to other methods.<br><br>Finally, note that they've just announced that in a couple of months they'll be making a more sophisticated version available which will enable you to track things more closely. I'm guessing that this means you'll be able to keep track of more fine-grained data than simply your overall daily score. (The catch, of course, is that that'll be something you'll have to pay for.)<br><br>Martin<br><br><br>P.S. I agree that the daily comments are a bit annoying. I just ignore them.</div>

<div class="content">Mark:  LOL.   I am glad you introduced Akinator to St Seraphim of Vyritsa.  :-)<br><br>Akinator did get Ilya Murometz on the first guess.  :-)<br><br>And Akinator ALWAYS gets Curious George on the first guess, which gets lots of giggles from my 6-YO daughter.    (She ALWAYS asks Akinator to guess Curious George; or sometimes, the Man With The Yellow Hat.)<br><br>Maybe for a real mood booster you just need to get a 6-YO daughter.  :-)  :-)   :-)</div>
