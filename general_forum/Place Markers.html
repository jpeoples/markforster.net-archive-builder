<div class="content">I had been dog-earing the first and last pages so I could find them quickly, and using the dot (and later the circled dot) to indicate the task I was working on.<br><br>But I have these plastic Post-it flags, and I got the idea of using them for these purposes.<br><br>The first active page is still dog-eared, because I only have to find that page about once a day, and I cut off the corners of completed pages, so it's no problem.<br><br>I got out my electric label-maker, and put "You are here" on one of the Post-it flags, to show the page that I am on. I put a label on both sides of the flag.<br><br>Another flag has "Write new tasks here," for the last page.<br><br>I also have some narrower, colorful flags that are like an "arrow" ~ I put the words "Task in progress" on some of those, and I can use them when I'm working on a task. This works better for me than a dot or a circled dot, because the dots look too much like symbols I already use, and they don't help the page in terms of visual clarity.<br><br>I've only used these for a day, but they seem to help keep me focused on the page & task I am on. It is helping more than I expected it would!<br><br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Sarah, very neat ideas!  You can also buy little post it flags that have an arrow on them.</div>

<div class="content">I find my notebook opens naturally at the last active page.  So I use a post it flag for my active page in my two contexts ("home" and "everything else").  I found some ones that are a bit thicker and meant to be used as page dividers, so they are very durable.</div>
