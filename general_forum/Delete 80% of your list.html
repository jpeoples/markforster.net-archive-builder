<div class="content">Random thought: Pareto's principle says 80% of value comes from 20% of effort and 20% of value comes from 80% of effort. Do you suppose this is true of your activities?  Can you successfully nuke 80% of my work, still get 80% value and then reuse that free 80% for stuff of more value?  (use value in the best and broadest sense of the word)</div>

<div class="content">Your post assumes that 'Pareto's principal' is:<br>1 - universally applicable<br>2 - true<br><br>Neither assumption is correct in my view.<br><br>That said, there is probably a lot on people's lists that could without much detriment be dropped, and a lot not on lists which should (and probably will) get done.</div>

<div class="content">PP is statistically proven for it's original subject (Italian real estate?) and demonstrated in many other fields. The effect is a natural consequence of variability. While the numbers change, it's a fact that some work brings greater reward than others. Cumulatively it often resembles pareto's curve. <br><br>The question is whether we can harness that fact to our advantage.</div>

<div class="content">I also tend to believe that the PP is a statistical reality. But the way it shows up is sometimes harder to define and can be done most effectively in retrospective then in forecasting.<br><br>For example, your activities that bring you money can all be dropped in the same category of Efforts -> Results. Eliminating those things that just provide you with the last 20% will leave you with the ones that provides you with the 80% and you will have eliminated about 80% of your work.<br><br>But the 20% of remaining work is not work that you can duplicate in most instances so what happens is a drop in income of 20% but a boost in available time of 80% which is not negligible. So don't bet on using the PP to define the 20% that give you 80% and try to do THAT THING for 40% and expect 160% Result.... I have no idea if i'm making myself clear!?!<br><br>On a tangential idea, I think that AF (and my system also by the way) provide a natural and automatic way to reach those vital 20% since even if you move on everything by doing just a little before it gets eliminated, you usually don't do much. So you naturally do those things that profit you the most.<br><br>Just using AF without thinking too much of the PP will make you use it anyways but thinking about it and really starting to eliminate stuff will clear not only your mind but your vision, goals,... your Life!<br><br>I personally eliminated about 40% of the "maintenance" (I think projects are more difficult to PP because they are in the forecasting realm) that I had and am enjoying the real boost in time it provides (and putting it in projects :) instead). I've noticed no big difference in my life quality and if nothing else, it's gotten better! I'm still far away from the 80% but slowly going there...</div>

<div class="content">I think Erik has pointed out an important issue with the Pareto Principle, which is whether or not there is sufficient high profit work to fill the 80% of low profit time.<br><br>For example, the PP is often used in surveying customers/clients: "20% of our existing customers bring in 80% of our income." The implication is that the other 80% should be jettisoned. But this is only a sensible thing to do if the high-profit section is expandable. Bear in mind too that you may be already spending 80% of your time on the 20% of high-profit customers.<br><br>This also raises some other issues, such as:<br><br>1) It is not usually a good thing to be dependent on a few highly profitable customers. If you lose their custom you will lose a very large chunk of your income and may find it difficult to replace.<br><br>2) The 80% "tail" of low-profit customers may be the very people who are telling the world at large how wonderful you are. Some of them may also be your future high-profit customers.<br><br>All I'm really saying is that the PP can be a useful tool, but mustn't be applied blindly.</div>

<div class="content">I'm not sure why, but what got me thinking was principle 6 "Devote Time" from <a href="http://litemind.com/productivity-principles/." target="new" rel="nofollow">http://litemind.com/productivity-principles/.</a><br>"The value of our achievements is primarily determined by what we consistently invest our time in."</div>

<div class="content">I love the PP. It applies often enough that it's always worth considering. It's a warning that we shouldn't spend hours doing things with little return. I use "return" in the larger sense, not immediate money.<br><br>If an assembly line is closed for an hour every day due to a clogged spout, it makes more sense to design a better spout or do routine cleaning rather than fix the electrical system which blows a fuse every three years.<br><br>However, too much focus on the PP is detrimental, because we don't always know where the biggest payoff will be. If we prioritize our task list the day after setting our budget, we'll probably emphasize income and savings. If we prioritize it after realizing we haven't taken the kids swimming in two months, we'll emphasize family. Long-term prioritizing only works if we're capable of balancing on that day.<br><br>The AF system lets us re-prioritize frequently. One day we'll work on money, another day family time.</div>
