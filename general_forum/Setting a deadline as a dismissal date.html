<div class="content">Sorry if this idea has been discussed in another thread, but if so I haven't seen it. <br><br>There seems an obvious way to handle urgent and/or deadlined tasks in DWM - I'm thinking of a deadline that's closer than 1 month (for a new task) or closer than 1 week (for a re-entered task) - and that's simply, on first entry, to set the dismissal date to equal the deadline date.<br><br>That means the task would be coming along the conveyor belt of doom at just the right position. <br><br>In fact, failing to do so would mean you'd entered a dismissal date that was essentially meaningless and non-functional.<br><br>I think I'll try this. Any thoughts?<br><br>Chris</div>

<div class="content">So you'd be entering things on any page between today & today+30? (or however many days you're using for 'today+next month') <br><br>If that's what you mean, I'd say no - using Mark's task-entry rules, the freshest tasks are *always* on today & today+30. If you add tasks to any page, you don't know any more which pages to focus on to see the freshest tasks. <br><br>I've used DWM with tasks due before & after the entry-date and as long as I put the due date as part of the task description, it hasn't been a problem getting things done on time. <br><br>And remember to follow Mark's rule # 5 - "All active pages are treated as if they were one long list and you continue to circulate round them doing the tasks that stand out" - and go through the entire list (which you'd need to do anyway if you're entering things on different dates)</div>

<div class="content">I tried it at the very beginning.  It didn't work very well for me.</div>
