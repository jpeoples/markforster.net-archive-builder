<div class="content">I've been away from the forum for a bit, now trying to get back on track with tasks, stuff, life etc.<br><br>A week ago I got my first 'proper' smartphone here in the UK.  It's a Samsung Galaxy SII sim-free (yes, expensive, but I need to change sim-cards according to which country I'm working in).<br><br>I've been very impressed with Android and the screen size 4.27" is ideal for moi's eyes and even chunky fingers.  So far I've been able to resist downloading lots of apps, and these are the ones that I have downloaded in case anyone else is interested:<br><br>Skype Mobile - great, no longer have to be tied to my notebook computer, at least until Microsnot mess it up.<br>My Tracks - records walks, cycling whatever<br>Barcode scanner<br>Google Goggles - may replace above app after testing<br>Evernote - nuff said, bye-bye OneNote<br>WhatsApp - clever (scary?) app which enables free texting, no more SMS, group chats to keep all members updated and in sync (eg for going away for a weekend, times, who brings what etc), a bit like having SMS always on.<br><br>To-Do List - this is a trial version for another few days, not perfect, HOWEVER it syncs both ways with Toodledo Pro on my notebook computer (Toshiba w/Windows 7), no need to wait forever for Toodledo to bring out an Android version.<br><br>Back to my tasks, with or without paper or smartphone.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Roger, I was eyeing that SGS2 to upgrade from my old WM6.5 Omnia2. But I couldn't wait for SGS2 to come over to my shores so I've gone for a cheap Android phone first (one of the many in Foxconn F911 family). Will wait for a few more dual core gingerbread phones to come before upgrading my cheap Android. ;-)<br><br>Will checkout that "To-Do List", but for now I'm content in accessing my Toodledo list via <a href="http://www.toodledo.com/slim/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.toodledo.com/slim/</a>  from my Android.<br><br>I see <a href="http://www.toodledo.com/tools/directory.php" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.toodledo.com/tools/directory.php</a> list out 7 third party apps for Android.<br>1. Got To Do<br>2. Due Today<br>3. Toodle Droid<br>4. TodoToday for Toodledo<br>5. Ultimate To-Do List (same as what you're testing?)<br>6. Pocket informant for Android<br>7. DGT-GTD<br><br>Any comments on the above apps?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Sabre, yes, it is the #5 Ultimate To-Do List I am testing.  I need to spend a bit more time with it, I'n very new to the smartphone way of working.  The other application worth looking at may be #4.  I quite like Toodledo in Windows 7, so want to get as much compatibility as I can.<br><br>I've got your email address, will enter a task to update you later, however it will not be a C2 task at first! ;-)))</div>

<div class="content">Congrats Roger on your excellent choice.<br><br>Like you (probably) I was waiting for ListPro to come out on Android, and even planning to get an iPhone because that wait seems indefinite.<br><br>But as soon as I found out that MLO was now available for Android I converted my DWM from ListPro to MLO and got a Samsung Galaxy S, the predecessor to your model.<br><br>Works fine for me, the PC and Android files synchronise to the cloud (a little complex to set up at first). Not sure how well it would work for SF.<br><br>It would be ideal if sync was automatic, but you have to press a button each time.</div>

<div class="content">Hello Laurence, good to 'hear' from you!  <br><br>Yes, Ilium seems to be struggling to keep up to date with Android although it has given good support for Windows and Windows Mobile to me, I cannot complain.  There is a 'solutio' for eWallet, but not as integrated as it should be.  I will stay with eWallet for now, other apps and conversion work beckon.<br><br>Toodledo is the most suitable electronic version in Windows for me  - thanks, Sarah, for your demo and contributions - but as I don't have an iPhone I was hesitant.  Toodledo may develop an Android version some time in the future, but the Ultimate To-Do app is good enough.<br><br>Yes, one has to remember to sync, but it working well enough for me now, especially with Folders  summary which shows me how many tasks are still in each page/column.  I have a folder for each page/column combination with 'C2' marked with an '*' egSF04*, SF04.1, SF05*, SF05.1 etc, and one for Review/LTBW.</div>
