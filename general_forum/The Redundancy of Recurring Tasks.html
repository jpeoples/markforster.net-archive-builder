<div class="content">I've hesitated to jump in to AF because of recurring tasks; figured I'd ask for some guidance instead of just bailing on the idea. <br><br>I have a large number of fairly routine tasks to do on a daily or weekly or monthly schedule, and I've got them tidily set up in an online task tracker. Mark has said to just add these tasks to the list and process along with everything else, but I find myself really balking at the idea of rewriting 15 or 20 or more tasks every day. It seems like a hugely redundant effort, and means I'd have to maintain two systems (online tasks plus the AF list) instead of just one. <br><br>Is there an effective way to manage this without rewriting a ton of tasks, and without maintaining two systems? I understand that AF could be a great way to work through all the routine tasks as well as emergent interesting ones; I'm just balking at having to constantly rewrite them. <br><br>Thanks,<br>Beth</div>

<div class="content">Actually just put an idea on form. ""Batching items""..should have read your post first :))<br><br>I'd suggest keeping your list or recurring tasks as it is and then putting on your AF list ""Do reccurring list""<br><br>That way you are not writing 20+ items a day, just the 1 as a reminder to do the 20.<br></div>

<div class="content">Good suggestion Margherita, there are often routine tasks that we would not want to add ad infinitum, such as "walk the dog" "eat lunch" etc.  However, Mark suggests initially adding these recurrings tasks into the system to allow the intuitive nature of AF to work with those items as it may identify the fact that some of them are unnecessary (not "walk the dog" or "eat lunch" of course :-) ), but what I found was it enabled to see that some of my routine tasks could be managed in a better way.  I initially put a few items like "do recurring tasks" on my list but found that they depressed me and became "ought to's" in my mind.  By listing them individually and allowing the system to select when I did them, I found that rather than resent them, I actually enjoyed doing most of them and also that my mind was not whingeing because it didn't want to do them but was excitedly looking at other possibilities and coming up with new ideas ..... <br><br>I think you may well find that those routines will just slip away, either by being done naturally as "part of life" or as being found to be unnecessary.  If there are routine items that you need to keep track of in another list then I would suggest "review recurring list" - for me the slight rephrasing from "do" to "review" seems to reduce resistance.  hope that helps ....</div>

<div class="content">Beth:<br><br>Basically I agree with Christine. The effort of re-writing the tasks is easily offset by the great advantage of having them properly assessed by the system. Having a big item like "Do Batched Tasks" is asking for resistance to get in the way.<br><br>But I would also ask, just how much effort is involved in re-writing these tasks? I've got a large number of recurrent tasks on my list. To write them out all at once would indeed be a major unpleasant task. But I don't have to do that. Take the task I'm working on at the moment "Comments". This task is going to take me at least 30 minutes, probably more. When I've finished it, I will cross out the task and re-write the single word "Comments" - just how big a burden is that? Heavens, I've already typed it twice in this reply!</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the replies. I've thought it over some more and realized a few things: <br><br>-I was very attached to my old system, and seeing AF as flawed because it didn't work that way, rather than trying it out. It's a more radical shift in perspective than I was expecting, I think. <br><br>-If I just rewrite each recurring task again as I complete it, that takes about 3 seconds and isn't the oppressive burden I had in mind; I was envisioning starting every day rewriting everything on my online task list. But I don't actually have to do that. <br><br>-And if I rewrite recurring tasks as I complete them, the system maintains itself; I don't need to maintain all my daily routine tasks in the online system--so I can just maintain one system instead of two. I'll just need to check the online system every so often for less-frequent tasks (weekly or monthly or annual) and it should be pretty slick. <br><br>So now I'm getting my autofocus list together to give it an honest try.</div>

<div class="content">Hi all<br>I actually agree with you all about putting them on the list to AF them.<br><br>I'm not sure if I should be in the forum (joking) as I seem to be learning as I'm writing, but I suppose that's what forum is all about, learning as we go and sharing the journey.<br><br>So far as I just flop every thought of what I have to, should do, could do, want to, need to on the list, it's like I gain clarity and going thru the list the next day I'm crossing a few off as being not neccessary or not what I really want to do anyway.<br><br>Would that be a bit like the 50+ books Mark was going to read one day, but by AFing them he whittled it down to 5 he truely did want to read?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Margherita<br><br>I for one am definately glad you're "in the forum" as your posts have made me realise that there was a whole load of items I had not put on my list, namely my "play" items.  I've always felt a degree of guilt when I take time for what i want to do as I always have something I feel I "should" do.  I can now add my hobbies to the list as well !!!!!!!</div>

<div class="content">I'm confused by recurring tasks - <br>I added tasks that have to be done daily to the list - I crossed them off the first day but now I'm on day three and still on the first page so I dont get any reminders of the daily recurring tasks. (* see below I think my understanding must be flawed)<br>This may be complicated by the fact (that I mentioned elsewhere) that a major part of my day is taken up doing one major recurring task (that I must do whether it's on the list or not - or no pay :p) and I have very little time for other tasks so I am getting through the list very slowly.<br>Otherwise I have to say the list is working well for me so far in the sense of getting me going/working<br><br>* if I understand correctly I stay with first page till it's done?<br>the instructions are confusing I find - from the Quick Start:- <br>5. ... Don't move onto the next page until you complete a pass of the page without any item standing out <br>6. Move onto the next page and repeat the process <br>7. If you go to a page and no item stands out for you on your first pass through it, then all the outstanding items on that page are dismissed ...<br>8. Once you've finished with the final page, re-start at the first page that is still active.<br>-<br>Surely line 7 should come before line 6 there?<br>So if I have to stay with a page till it's done or dismissed - how come there is still active pages back there when I'm on the final page (#8)<br><br>Help!<br>thanks, Tom</div>

<div class="content">okay<br>I've read the "Clarification: Speed of movement" blog post where Mark says<br>"You only HAVE to do one item on each page, and you only HAVE to work for a short time on that item. So you could in theory move from the first page to the last page in a matter of minutes."<br><br>so I have completely misunderstood but Mark, I have to say this is not at all clear from the email you sent - I think you should clarify this for future recipients.<br>What's missing is the instruction to move on from a page -without dismissing everything- if you have just done an item from it but nothing else stands out for you<br><br>On rereading in the light of your blog post I can see you are saying that but indirectly ...<br><br>thanks, Tom</div>

<div class="content">Tom:<br><br><<What's missing is the instruction to move on from a page -without dismissing everything- if you have just done an item from it but nothing else stands out for you>><br><br>"Continue going round the same page in the same way. Don't move onto the next page until you complete a pass of the page without any item standing out" is what I said in the instructions. I would have thought that means exactly what you say is missing.</div>

<div class="content">Apologies Mark, yes - it IS all there in the email you sent !<br><br>I got a bit flustered on discovering my mistake -<br>I had printed out the mail and read it 3 or 4 times - I think I misread it on first reading & after that I read what I thought I already knew as opposed to what was there ...<br>I *was* confused about it, had it on my list to ask here but I wasnt getting beyond the first page lol<br><br>BTW, I notice from the comments on that blog post that I wasnt the only one thought who had this misunderstanding.<br>I still think it could be helpful to add that clarification (for emphasis) -<br>"You only HAVE to do one item on each page, and you only HAVE to work for a short time on that item. So you could in theory move from the first page to the last page in a matter of minutes." to future emails.<br><br>I still have a problem with recurring items but will try the new *AF* for a while & see how I get on before posting again, <br>thanks, Tom</div>

<div class="content">Tom, that is so true how once you have misread something you automatically reread it the same way!</div>
