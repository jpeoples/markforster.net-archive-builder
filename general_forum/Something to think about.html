<div class="content">+JMJ+<br><br>__Love restores work. You do not have to like your work to love it, just as you do not have to like a person to love him. If you believe in your work, you can love it, for faith and love are twins. But if you do not believe in what you do, you cannot love it, for you really think it is just unnecessary busyness or the unnecessary making or advertising or marketing or distributing of silly luxuries. And then half your waking life becomes subtle economic slavery. ---- Peter Kreeft___</div>
