<div class="content">Mike Brown left a comment on the blog about the benefits of handwriting (vs typing) re: no-list systems. For many years, I switched back and forth between typing (Evernote, Things, Omnifocus) and writing (Levenger Circa). However the Apple Pencil 2 and iPad mini provide me with a near perfect analog/digital experience. For those interested, I've documented my process (with photos) here: <br><br><a href="http://nadigel.com/journal" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://nadigel.com/journal</a></div>

<div class="content">Beautiful, I’ll have to play with this idea. What do use for the journal?</div>

<div class="content">Originally, DayOne. But for the past two years, Pages (Mac). <br><br>Every year - on January 2 - I export a PDF of my journal and send it off to LuLu for printing. It's a wonderful way to end/begin the year.</div>

<div class="content">I love the idea of digital paper type devices, but my obsessions with calligraphic writing, the feel of paper, the use of fountain pens with specialist nibs, and so forth has meant that I've never been able to find a tool that works well and that doesn't remove some of the romance that I crave through pen and paper. <br><br>On the other hand, for people who don't have my particular proclivities, it's pretty amazing just how good some of the systems have become now. And some of them are even good enough to be compatible with fine penmanship! <br><br>But I still type too fast and (hand)write too meticulously to be able to use them.</div>

<div class="content">Aaron: <br><br><<I love the idea of digital paper type devices, but my obsessions with calligraphic writing, the feel of paper [...] that doesn't remove some of the romance that I crave>><br><br>You've touched on an important point... emotional touchstones. What is the MOST important thing when you're doing any thing. <br><br>I love a good pen and quality paper. I can not walk into a quality stationary store and leave empty handed. However, most of the tools end up in a drawer. I've learned my lesson. The most important thing for me is to gather my sketches (all done on iPad), important photos (all done w/ iPhone) and daily narrative and capture for nostalgic (and keepsake) purposes. And for all of that to happen - effortlessly - I need to forgo the luxuriant feel of pen to paper.</div>

<div class="content">I like this!<br><br>What's the advantage of using the Apple Pencil and later uploading it vs using paper, taking a photo, and using OCR to render it to text. OneNote is one of many notes software that has this capability.</div>

<div class="content">vegheadjones: <br><br><< What's the advantage of using the Apple Pencil and later uploading it vs using paper, taking a photo, and using OCR to render it to text.>><br><br>Mostly, one tool for everything. With an iPad Mini and Apple Pencil I have a notebook, sketching tool (with pens, water-colours, etc), a calendar, etc. <br><br>Plus, I have tried numerous OCR tools - Rocket Book, a few iPhone Apps - and the conversion is inferior to Apple's OCR. <br><br>Finally, when I write with an Apple Pencil, I can move things around the list, erase, etc.</div>

<div class="content">Sorry to disappoint everyone, but I use a black BIC Cristal Original ballpoint (cheap and reliable) with a lined A4 Cambridge Jotter notepad. When I finish a page I tear it out (they're perforated) and shred it.<br><br>When I'm away from home, I don't use a time management list anyway, so the list can stay on my desk always.<br><br>Advantages:<br><br>1. I don't have to worry about looking good, calligraphy or layout.<br>2. I can fit in three columns to the page (I have managed as many as six, but that's pushing it more than a bit).<br>3. If I wanted to (I don't) I could scan the page into Evernote.<br>4. It's fast and legible to me but to no one else - because no one else can read my handwriting.<br>5. If I want to make changes or corrections I just scribble them out and write in the new stuff.<br><br>Disadvantages:<br><br>1. I can't actually think of any at the moment, but I'm sure there must be some.</div>

<div class="content">Mark: <br><br><< Sorry to disappoint everyone, but I use a black BIC Cristal Original ballpoint (cheap and reliable) with a lined A4 Cambridge Jotter notepad.>><br><br>As demonstrated in the YouTube video where you're explaining Autofocus 1. I love that video. <br><br>For the purposes of creating a list, your tools and approach work very well. However the list portion of my workflow goes in a different direction.</div>

<div class="content">A few years ago I bought a Remarkable (version one), which is an e-ink device similar an oversized kindle. It has a stylus and allows you to take notes. The screen is lightly textured so it feels closer to writing on paper than using a tablet. It has genuinely replaced paper notes for me entirely.<br><br>I originally bought it to take notes in 1-2-1 meetings with staff. Using a laptop felt as though it created a barrier and could give the impression that I was checking email rather than being present. Paper notes felt a bit scruffy and meant maintaining separate notebooks for each staff member.<br><br>I've held off mentioning it previously because I didn't want to sound like an advert for it. It's maddeningly expensive - I bought mine factory reconditioned on black Friday and still struggled to justify the cost. The battery could also be better, but that's likely due to the age of my device. And whilst you can read ebooks on it, you can't import them from the Kindle (Amazon have a proprietary file format), and there's no back light.<br><br>I agree that taking photos of notebooks and using OneNote is a workable substitute, but I can't switch back! Being able to erase and undo handwriting, shift text around, and keep all my notebooks together seem like minor things, but I lean on them quite a bit.</div>

<div class="content">JohnD:<br><br>I'm on the Remarkable advertising email list, so I keep up pretty well with what it's got to offer, but In spite of its looking like it deserves the "remarkable" name, I've never quite felt that the cost justifies the difference from what I can do already with my current set-up (Desktop and Smartphone). If I was a better artist it might be a different story, as would be the ability to read Kindle books.</div>

<div class="content">Mark, re: Disadvantages<br><br>It seems to me that Avrum's system goes beyond time management and is more a reflective practise based around creating narratives. I liked his idea of adding cartoons or doodles which is more of a left brain process I suppose. In general of course both processes embrace the “think in ink” tactic which has always helped me gain clarity.</div>

<div class="content">"When I'm away from home, I don't use a time management list anyway, so the list can stay on my desk always."<br><br>How do you make this work? Much of my work happens out and about but I see the value of a big notepad as does my mentor who keeps a yellow legal pad with him everywhere he goes.<br><br>Just not bringing it isn't an option for me, and having a moleskins is so nice I don't want to write in it half the time.</div>
