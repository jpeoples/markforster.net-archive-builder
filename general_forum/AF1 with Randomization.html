<div class="content">hi all,<br><br>I've been trying a new method to great success thus far.<br><br>1.  AF1 style list.<br>2.  I read through all the items on the page once.<br>3.  I go through again and do the first thing that stands out.<br>4.  I go through this process until nothing more stands out.<br>5.  BEFORE I go on, I make myself randomly select two tasks and work on them.<br>6.  I move on to the next page and repeat.<br><br>What I found with AF1 is that I tended to pick the easy tasks as I cycled through and then ended up having to force myself to do a task I didn't want to do or else face dismissal.<br><br>With this process, I seem to be tackling the easy tasks and then invariably end up randomly selecting a task I had originally avoided.<br><br>Anyway, thought I'd share.<br><br>Brett</div>

<div class="content">Hi Brett,<br><br>one question: what if nothing stands out on a page on the first pass - do you dismiss the items on that page (like the af1 rules say) or do you then try to knock them (all) off with the randomizer? so that in the end nothing gets dismissed?<br><br>stefan</div>

<div class="content">hi Stefan,<br><br>Funny, I didn't actually think about dismissal.  <br><br>I will say that I've been forcing myself to not pass a list without actioning at least one task, so hence actioning 3 tasks at a minimum.<br><br>I also added another rule: if there are only two tasks left on that page I have to action both before moving on.<br><br>I've found this to be an incredibly powerful method so far.  I've completed/worked on a lot of projects I didn't want to work on.<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>brett</div>

<div class="content">Brett:<br><br>Sounds like it's working well for you. One question: in the course of your experimentation did you try it the opposite way round? In other words, did you try selecting the two random tasks first and then doing any other tasks that stood out on the page?</div>

<div class="content">Brett, I'm trying that with a very small list -- my email backlog. I'm finally climbing out of what was probably another bout of depression, so the low-priority backlog is pretty large. There's nothing urgent, but tons of small things that need a few minutes of thinking, and ideas for several projects that I need to review.<br><br>I'm using months for pages. I'm rolling a 10-sided die and counting from the top. Once if the month has fewer than 30 entries, otherwise twice. If the chosen email is part of a discussion, I deal with the entire discussion.<br><br>So far, so good.</div>

<div class="content">Oh, randomisations on email inboxes! That's a good idea (my inbox is a very long way from inbox zero.)</div>

<div class="content">Inbox zero doesn't work for me. It's too much chasing small things and reacting too quickly. I'm way behind at the moment, but I prefer 10 to 30.<br><br>That's long enough to hold the last few messages in any open conversation, with a few reminders (so I don't have to copy them to my todo list). It's short enough that it's easy to scan quickly.<br><br>When it does become this long, I am very careful to deal with any urgent messages on time. The rest, though, can wait their turn.<br><br>When it does grow, it drops pretty quickly, since often the randomizer lands in the middle of a conversation. One action from me, and half a dozen messages can be filed.<br><br>The roller coaster nature of my inbox works surprisingly well. When I'm on top of things, I'm happy letting the annoying things wait. It doesn't bother me at the time, since overall I'm happy with how things are going. When it gets too large, I just want to get it smaller, and that means dealing with all the annoying things in it.</div>

<div class="content">Here's my latest experiment with combining AF and Random:<br>1. Start with a long list of everything, or use the list you have. <br>2. SMEMA stage. At the end of the list, write three tasks you feel like doing. Cross it off the list if it comes from the list, but it doesn't have to. Continue smema style until you reach the end of the page (do 2 tasks, add 2 more). If any new tasks come up, just add them to the next page, since you'll be doing smema all the way to the end of the page. (I use a small 22 line moleskin notebook)<br>3. Random stage: Once you reach the bottom of the page, start doing the random list, with sliding, from the beginning. Roll all the way to the end. <br>4. AF stage. Use any of the other AF systems to circulate around the list until you get to the end. I use FV. <br>5. Start again with SMEMA and continue 2-4. Don't forget to write new, repeated or unfinished tasks either at the end of the list (random and AF stages) or starting on a new page (SMEMA). <br>This sounds more complicated than it is. Just circulate: Smema, random, AF. For me, tthese three methods provide lots of variety, lots of opportunity to get urgent and important tasks done and lots of amunition for procrastination and resistance.</div>
