<div class="content">Hi everybody,<br><br>After having used my own version of AF which I called DUAL FOCUS for a few months<br>( <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/712308" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/712308</a> )<br>sometimes combined with daily lists (condensed AF) and 'The Pomodoro Technique' and being quite happy with it I feel like I would like some more focus on the older tasks and also an automatic dismissal (review) system.<br><br>RAF seems to do just that, so I decided I am going to give it a shot!<br><br>I use a simple Excel sheet for my list and love it, it's neat, flexible, searchable and very easy to add, hightlight items etc. Every now and then (aprox. once a week) I like to clean up all the items that have been dismissed or done.<br><br>I believe this cleaning up completed tasks is one of the major advantages of working with an electronic list compared to paper. It speeds up the selection process of the next task.<br><br>Unfortunately RAF *needs* the completed and dismissed tasks on the list to be there to work propely.<br><br>Since a lot of people use digital systems that not always support crossing off and leaving in the list wouldn't it be an idea to come up with a version that doesn't *need* these items to be in place? If you work with a digital list you don't want this extra clutter anyway.<br><br>I personally simply:<br>- only put the first item on notice for review (not the first block)<br>- am not too worried about forward mode not being 'closed list' anymore but use a similar approach as with reverse mode, only starting from the other side<br><br>What do you guys think?<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Cruisader!<br><br>Your approach is certainly doable, but I have two concerns:<br><br>1. Some people complained about the blockwise dismissal process being too slow, so going down from blocks to single tasks will slow it down further. Of course not everyone has this problem.<br><br>2. If forward mode works like reverse mode, what is the mechanism to go back to reverse mode?<br><br>I am a completionist myself, so I actually prefer to keep all tasks as they were. One of the advantages of digital systems is that just because you can't see something, that doesn't mean it's not there. Meaning you can hide dismissed and done tasks if you don't need to see them, and make them visible again if you do.<br><br>My preference is:<br>- Archive completed pages to trim the list, but leave dismissed and done tasks on incomplete pages<br>- Let the software only show me actionable tasks<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Cruisader,<br><br>Have you tried it yet? How do you feel it works?<br><br>I don't exactly see the functionality in the system you describe. It seems like a standard to-do list, except you work sequentially through each item and you do so from top to bottom and bottom to top? The review system you have in place prunes the oldest task everyday unless you action it, correct?<br><br>I suppose it loses some of the "horsepower" of AF because only 1 item is in danger of being put on review and because you can zoom past that item quickly to work on the rest of your list, since your first page isn't a "closed" one. <br><br>In AF its possible to have whole swaths of items on notice for review. But, more importantly, those old tasks would be confined to the first page (according to my reading of the rules) and you wouldn't progress beyond that page until you did something on it. You would keep seeing that same page, those same unactioned items, multiple times a day (in FM). They would either be picked off one by one (so that you can move forward) or they would all be put on review (presumably because they aren't important to you or there is resistance to them).<br><br>In your system I could foresee item #36 on your list languishing for over a month, unactioned and *EXEMPT*. In other words there is no pressure to look at that item. You can go on through your list and it won't be put on notice for 35 days if you keep ignoring it.<br><br>Autofocus does the opposite: it Auto(matically) puts your Focus on two things simultaneously (1) tasks that are ripe to be done and, hopefully, THE best tasks to do at the moment; and (2) tasks that need to be audited -- either done or forgotten about for the time being.<br><br>Those are my impressions without actually testing out your system. Let us know how it goes?<br><br>--Joseph</div>

<div class="content">@Andreas Hofmann:<br><br>1. I guess the number of tasks put on notice could also be a parameter of the system. I like to just put one item on notice. It improves the chance of me actually doing it but maybe some people would prefer to put the first 3 or 5 tasks on notice...<br><br>2. I haven't entered FORWARD MODE yet, so to me this is kind of hypothetical, but I guess the trigger would be when REVERSE MODE stands out in my head...<br><br>@Joseph:<br><br>If I put a whole load of tasks on review I will not end up doing something to all of them and many will simply disappear to the review list. This doesn't solve anything. It is always possible for items to not get actioned for ages. In any system. Simply don't do them even though you know you should lol ;-)<br><br>--- <br><br>I would be interested to hear what percentage of the time the people in this community spend in FORWARD MODE aproximately?<br><br>I have switched to my version of RAF (which wasn't a huge change for me from DUAL FOCUS actually) one week ago but wonder how often FORWARD MODE is actually going to 'stand out'. I guess it wil one of these days....<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Cruisader,<br><br>Yes, but the point is that in your system you can ignore BOTH the one item in danger for review AND the rest of the items on your list without any consequences. After all, only one item might be put on review (that's not so bad. . .) and you can progress to all the items on your list in forward mode since you don't implement RAF's closed list rule. See?<br><br>In RAF if you ignore the items on notice for review you will (usually) be risking multiple items AND you can't leave the page they are on without actioning at least one of them. Do you see how this works as an engine to drive action of items that are on the early part of the list?<br><br>--Joseph</div>

<div class="content">P.S. I should add, though, if your system *works* for you, then great! I'm just just giving my assessment based on its theoretical application.<br><br>--Joseph</div>

<div class="content">@Joseph:<br><br>First of all I have not entered FORWARD MODE yet (only one week into my version of RAF, just returned from holiday so a lot current stuff) and imagine in general FORWARD MODE is something I won't be spending a lot of time in, maybe 10-20% max. So this discussion is a bit hypothetical to me but still interesting though :-)<br><br>You raise the point of having more items on notice as being more motivating to getting at least some of them worked on. Maybe this works for some people but for many people *lowering* goals and making them easier and more realistic and thus not becoming overwelmed tends to be more motivating. Every day I know there is one item that is on notice. So I don't even have to go back and check which one.<br><br>Maybe I'll raise it to 2 or 3 in a few weeks when doing 'old' stuff becomes more natural to me.<br><br>The main reason I have a different approach (no closed list) in FORWARD MODE is because I clean up my list once a week and get rid of completed and dismissed tasks.<br><br>However thinking about it a bit more I think this approach might also actually be better! The reason for this is that this way I will at least get to see the items on page 2 and 3. With the closed list approach I would not see them for weeks...<br><br>I guess it very much depends how much time you spend in FORWARD MODE and how motivated you are by the 'on notice threat'. What's that like for you?<br><br>I'd be very interested to learn how long people in this community spend in FORWARD MODE. What percentage of the time aproximately?</div>

<div class="content">Cruisader,<br><br>Just to be clear, I'm not on a crusade to eliminate your system. . .  I'm just hashing it out with you, because I assume that is what you are looking for on this thread.<br><br>You said: <<However thinking about it a bit more I think this approach might also actually be better! The reason for this is that this way I will at least get to see the items on page 2 and 3. With the closed list approach I would not see them for weeks...>><br><br>Here's the thing. As I understand it in FM of RAF the greatest length of time it would take for a page to be entirely put on review would be equal to or less than half the total number of lines on a page. So for a 30 line page, if every other item had been done, and you placed the line after the first continuous block every day ---> it would take 15 days for all these items to be put on review.<br><br>But, that is the worst case scenario. For that to happen you would have had to action every other item on the page and then never action another one. Unlikely, no? For two reasons:<br><br>1) at least a few contiguous blocks likely have MORE than one item, and for each 2 additional item in a block that is one less day it would take for all the items to be put on review. So if your first block has 6 items in it, it would take only (15-6/2)=12 days for the whole page to be put on review.  You can see how quickly this would mount up, given a few multi-item contiguous blocks. And;<br><br>2) more importantly with a *closed list* there is an engine which propels you to action (even a little! not even to completion!) at least *one* item on this closed page. If you don't you leave the page and go back into RM. So, either you chip away at  this page, or you never get past it in FM, *or* you realize that the items (or some of them) on this page are *never* going to get done for some reason and then you just outright delete them.<br><br>So, again, worst case scenario with a 30 line page is that item #30 of page 1 would be reached in 15 days or less, and you would be forced to deal with it. In contrast, in your system, the worst case scenario is that item #30 of page 1 might not be on the radar for 30 days. <br><br>The other problem is losing the "autofocus" element. I take the autofocusing aspect of AF to be that *items* are put in focus, and not just ends of list are put in focus (a'la the dualfocus system in your other thread). If the first page is closed I *have* to deal with it somehow. Either I chip away at it "little and often", or I realize they will never get done and delete them. The tension is that FM wants me to go forward, but won't let me until I do something. *That* is the engine.<br><br>In your system you can ignore all the items on page one for 30 days, and work on page 2 items, or even page 3 or 4 items! You could ignore 3 pages of items for 90 days and blissfully work on page 4. Not so in RAF. Those first 3 pages will be dealt with either by a)your desire to get to the next page, or b) the inexorable line of doom which eats up multiple items quickly, or c) common sense which tells you to just delete items to get to the next page.<br><br>Or perhaps my maths are off, and I'm misunderstanding everything. In that case, please tell me to go jump in the lake!  : )<br><br>--Joseph<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Cruisader:<br><br>It's always difficult to judge the effectiveness of a system just from reading it, but with that proviso the impression I got from reading through your description was that you were badly weakening "forward mode".<br><br>What you have in the two main modes is two powerful tools for dealing with tasks. Reverse mode is best for urgent and less weighty items and forward mode is best for less urgent and more weighty items - though they are not mutually exclusive.<br><br>One of the great advantages of the Revised AF system is that both tools are available to be used when appropriate. If one is weakened then the other has to take up the slack by doing the job it isn't best at.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Cruisader<br><br>Two things struck me from your post/s ......<br><br>You said <<It is always possible for items to not get actioned for ages. In any system. Simply don't do them even though you know you should lol ;-)>><br><br>That is very true but is the very thing that the AF2/RAF dismissal mode eliminates - the ability to procrastinate almost endlessly by "just doing one item".<br><br>Also you stated << The main reason I have a different approach (no closed list) in FORWARD MODE is because I clean up my list once a week and get rid of completed and dismissed tasks.>><br><br>That may be why you have those large unactioned blocks.  If you are operating RAF according to the rules, and working primarily in reverse mode, then very few pages are likely to have more than a few items outstanding - and those will probably only be single or small blocks.  I had large blocks under AF1 but it is unusual for me to have more than single items outstanding on any post AF1 pages.<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Joseph, Marc and Christine B,<br><br>To me cleaning up the system is very important, it makes my picking of tasks a lot more efficient. I really notice the difference decluttering my list makes. This was the main reason for my tweaks.<br><br>I think however I have just come up with a way to implement the 'official' RAF rules' while still cleaning up my system once a week!!!<br><br>I use a list on one sheet in Excel. I add (new) dates of when I add a task in a seperate column and from now on I will also add a task *number* for each task in a separate column.<br><br>This way I can still identify 'pages' for forward mode and continuous blocks of tasks to put on notice.<br><br>Thanks for your comments and 'stimulating' me to come up with this!<br><br>Hopefully following the 'official rules' will make forward mode more appealing to me. I'll let you know how I go....<br></div>

<div class="content">Cruisader,<br><br>You're welcome. I don't entirely understand how you are doing what you are doing in Excel, but I do understand the principle of what you are doing. It seems to make sense.<br><br> I suppose some sort of program or webapp that let you FILTER views between ALL TASKS (including ones that have been done already) and ACTIVE TASKS (excluding ones that have been done) and REVIEW TASKS (only tasks on review) would be the ideal for you!<br><br>The key would be that the list is still processed in ALL TASKS mode. . . it uses the line of doom, and contiguous blocks of unactioned items (and therefore needs to know where the ones that have already been done are). <br><br>I can't see a way of doing this easily on paper -- and that is its only drawback for me. I feel that AF should be able to be implemented even in the jungles of Borneo without batteries or solar panels!<br><br>--Joseph<br></div>
