<div class="content">Looking forward to someone doing a flow chart for the newest version for the visual folks.<br><br>Thanks<br>Karen</div>

<div class="content">Okay, wow, that was truly evil. ;-)<br><br>Here is my first try, but I'll definitely have to rethink the whole layout. I just added stuff to my AF2 flowchart (which gave some people headaches by itself), and it's quite a mess now. I used color coding to distinguish the different modes. Hope that makes it easier to read.<br><br>Here it is: <a href="http://autofocus.cc/public/data/revised-flowchart.png" rel="nofollow">http://autofocus.cc/public/data/revised-flowchart.png</a></div>

<div class="content">Loving the flowchart.  Helped me confirm my understanding of the rules.</div>

<div class="content">Andreas,<br><br>Great job on that. I'm sure it will prove helpful to those of us (like myself) who appreciate visual confirmation that were working through things the right way.<br><br>I know there is a limit to the level of detail and complexity one may want from a flowchart, but here are couple of things to consider:<br><br>1) Your purple box "Go to the next unactioned task before the current one" might benefit from this addition ", if there is one, otherwise return to the end of list and continue to work in Reverse Mode". I'd leave it to you how the flow arrows would map out of that.<br><br>2) Your blue diamond "Was it your first pass through the current page" leads directly to "Re-add change to FM" (and then to Reverse Mode). However, you might benefit from an additional diamond fork between the two -- a diamond with the question "Is this the LAST page?" A "yes" would take you to the first page and continuing on in FM, and a "no" would take you to reverse mode. Does that make sense?<br><br>Folks! Can anyone verify for me my point in #2 above that if you are in forward mode, and get to your last page, and you don't take any action on that page that you should go to first page and continue in forward mode?<br><br>Thank you!<br>--Joseph</div>

<div class="content">Joseph:<br><br>You are correct, the instructions state "The signal to move back to Reverse Mode is when you come to a page and don’t do any<br>of the tasks on it. This rule does not apply to the last page of the list - the one on which<br>you are currently entering tasks.".</div>

<div class="content">That was SO helpful. Would you mind creating a black-and-white version for people who don't have color printers?<br><br>Also, at the risk of being greedy, perhaps you could create a multi-page version (with some boxes reading 'go to page two' or whatever) so that it could be printed with larger font and would be easier to read on paper.<br><br>Again, THANK YOU. This makes the rules so much easier to understand at the beginning.</div>

<div class="content">Joseph:<br><br>I changed the flowchart to incorporate your suggestions. I replaced the original file, so the link in the first post is still current.

<div class="content">The multi-page version is amazingly helpful. Seeing each mode clearly broken out makes the whole process more digestible. Thanks for putting this together.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Andreas<br>WELL DONE!  I think you performed a miracle......your RAF flowchard is the first flow chart I didn't hate!.....and I was actually able to follow it without building up anxiety!<br>Thank you for the fine work!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="meta">2009-08-1 22:21</div>
<div class="content">Thanks everyone.<br><br>For a more permanent home I created a Flowcharts page in the AutofocusWiki: <a href="http://wiki.autofocus.cc/Flowcharts" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.autofocus.cc/Flowcharts</a><br><br>I also listed all other flowcharts I found in the forum. Are there more flowcharts out there, or did I get them all?</div>
<h2>Reply by Andreas Hofmann</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-08-1 22:26</div>
<div class="content">By the way, I first listed the systems as "Revised Autofocus", "Autofocus 2" and "Autofocus 1", then I changed it to "Autofocus", "Legacy Autofocus 2" and "Legacy Autofocus 1". What do you think?</div>
<h2>Reply by Stan</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-08-3 23:37</div>
<div class="content">This detailed flow chart has been very helpful to me. But now that I am getting familiar with the system, I find that I need less detail and more of a cheat sheet flow chart. I've created one, but don't know how to upload it. If someone can tell me how to post it here, I would be happy to.</div>
<h2>Reply by Andreas Hofmann</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-08-4 7:25</div>
<div class="content">Hi Stan,<br><br>you can email it to me (andreas at autofocus.cc) and I'll upload it to autofocus.cc, publish it in the wiki and post the link here.</div>

<div class="content">Andreas,<br><br>I noticed a few minor errors in the multipage version of the flowchart:<br><br>- At the bottom of the Reverse Mode page, you should add the text "to Review Mode" to be consistent with all of the other jump points<br>- At the top of the Forward Mode page, the "from Reverse Mode" link should actually be #2, not #3.<br>- At the top of the Forward Mode page, the "from Review Mode" link should be #7, not #6<br><br>Extremely minor nitpicks, but I figured I'd file the "bugs" anyway :)</div>
