<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-12-4 16:34</div>
<div class="content">Just started at the first of the month with AF1.  Absolutely blown away.  As a creative person (writer, photographer) who is working an office job as well as being a Dad in a family of five, it's been very difficult to find a system that is flexible enough to withstand my daily life.  Till now!  Not sure if I'll wander over into the deeper waters of AF4 but I imagine its only a matter of time.<br><br>One quick question I'm curious about  (that may or may not also mark me as thick-headed) - I know you treat each page as a unit.  When you start to review the list do you start at the first active page?  For instance, I have about 5 pages right now.  Every time I start the process of going over the list do I start on "page one" or do I just begin on anywhere I'd like?<br><br>Thanks all and looking forward to the discussions!<br>~Bryan~</div>

<div class="content">"Review" in the rules usually means going over the dismissed pages. But to your question, restart where you left off. <br><br>As for Af1, keep doing it as long as it works. There are second generation systems now that aim to replace, go beyond AF1 and AF4.</div>

<div class="content">I agree with Alan. Unless you feel a need to change, stick to AF1. Only when you notice a need for a specific effect of another variation should you consider using it :)</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the clarification on Reviewing.<br><br>It's a minor point but just want to make sure... <br><br>When I get up in the morning and look at my list, I should start at the first active page with, let's say, it's 5 items? Or do I start a few pages in?  <br><br>On dismissing - <br>If I don't work on one of the five tasks on the first time through then all 5 get dismissed?  OR.. do I wait to dismiss them AFTER I've gone through my 6 active pages, come back to page #1 and decide not to do them?<br><br>I feel like I'm maybe splitting hairs here...  Thanks, everyone, for your patience!</div>

<div class="content">As far as I'm aware, you start in the morning where you left off the day before. So, if that is a few pages in, then start there.<br><br>As for dismissing... Again, as far as I'm aware, when you are on a page and there is no task that feels ready to be done, you *mark* them as 'to be dismissed'. Then when you get to that page *again* later in the day (for example), you decide which to add to your list again (preferably you rephrase them or split them up so that they will be easier to tackle), and which to cross off permanently.</div>

<div class="content">BryanR:<br><br>In AF1, after a break you start again where you left off. If the break has been long enough for you to feel you can't remember what is on the list, then it's recommended that you read through the entire list quickly before starting again. This isn't usually necessary if the break is only overnight.<br><br>Dismissal takes place every time you don't do any tasks on a page during a visit to it. So in the example you give you would dismiss the five tasks immediately, not on the next visit.  However please note that tasks are never dismissed from the last page (that is the one that is still open).<br><br>Dismissed tasks should be highlighted and reviewed regularly.</div>

<div class="content">Mark and All,<br><br>These answers have helped me immensely!  Also, I've bumped up against my first "dismissal fears" and I need to remember that dismissal does not mean "Gone."   Though I will have to reconsider why certain dismissed items weren't done the first time!</div>

<div class="content">Dismissal is very powerful!</div>

<div class="content">In regards to dismissal, I figured out a great key to this system that I missed in simply reading the rules.  "Work on that item for as long as you feel like doing so."<br><br>Dismissal forced me to look at an item and then decide if there was one simple thing I could do to keep it from being dismissed even if it meant I only worked on the task for less than a minute.  It caused me to see how tasks could be broken down into smaller and smaller chunks.  <br><br>For example, I have a very large, personal photo project that involved reviewing several hundred photos but with no deadline to it.  It was about to be dismissed because I had overlooked it several times and procrastinated on it.  Instead, I realized that I could spend a few moments, build the folder structure for the project, and then be done.  Moving it forward and saving it from dismissal.  I just had to remember, "little and often."  When I rewrote it, I broke my next step down as "Review 20 photos."<br><br>Finally, if it wasn't something I could break down  into a small task, then it had gone through its chances and was highlighted as dismissed.  <br><br>Steaming right along!!!</div>
