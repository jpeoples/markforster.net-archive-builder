<div class="meta">2010-09-14 15:22</div>
<div class="content">I've just cleared all the spam off the forum. It's a bit rough and ready and inevitably I will have missed some, and equally inevitably I will have deleted some which wasn't spam at all - apologies to the writers if that is the case.<br><br>And now I must go and try out my new Ugg boots and Vibram 5-Fingers, before taking my new Russian wife out to dinner.</div>

<div class="content">Nice to see you back, Mark.<br>Two threads, I found interesting enough to note...<br>* <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1219407" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1219407</a> Re-Entry of Recurring Tasks in DWM. Some administrivia tasks need to be treated as completed for the month, and added as new task at Today+30.<br>* <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1221756" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1221756</a> Discipline vs Motivation. I agree motivation is key and what I need working on. And DWM little often helps. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Welcome back, Mark, and congratulations on your marriage!  I hope you will both be very happy together.<br><br>Now, I was going to ask you which TM system you are currently using, but I suppose TM is not uppermost in your thoughts at the moment!  Hopefully you will let us know your thoughts when you are ready.<br><br>best wishes,<br><br>acedia xx</div>

<div class="content">I think he was referring to a wife (a good thing) growing out of spam (generally considered a bad thing). Russian was only mentioned because several of the spam posts were from sites advertising available Russian brides.</div>

<div class="content">For the record, I didn't know that the spam was about Russian Wives.<br>I just thought it was general/porn spam...<br>Now compared with the latter spam, I highly prefer things of a real nature and substance.<br><br>That said, if someone can find happiness through an arranged marriage, I'm all for it.<br>It's been done for centuries!</div>

<div class="content">Avrum:<br><br><< During those 35, has she tried any of your systems? >><br><br>No, as I say in one of my books (I think Get Everything Done), she is a natural time manager and the only system she needs is to write the occasional list on the back of an envelope.</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br>You may be interested to know that science may be catching up with your "How to make your dreams come true" book: "Strangers to Ourselves: Discovering the Adaptive Unconscious" by an academic called Timothy Wilson has been published.<br><br>"Man, many scientists now believe, may not really be a rational animal but a post-rationalising animal; the conscious brain merely passing commentary on the actions of the unconscious in the way that football commentators contrive a narrative to explain the largely random events taking place on the field." - according to <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/advertising/rory-sutherland-on-advertising-brands-are-like-the-antlers-on-a-stag-1779557.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/advertising/rory-sutherland-on-advertising-brands-are-like-the-antlers-on-a-stag-1779557.html</a><br><br>It's like the idea that purchasing decisions are rational. perhaps we are being seduced by the feeling that we'll get?</div>

<div class="content">MC:<br><br>Thanks for the reference, but these theories have been around in the scientific world for quite a while. It woudn't be true to say that science is catching up with "Dreams", butrather that I based it on the best scientific ideas I could find at the time.</div>
