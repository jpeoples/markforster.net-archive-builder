<div class="content">Only a few more hours left for Monday, London time. Are there "glitches" affecting the rollout? (Haven't checked US or UK Amazon site yet. . .)</div>

<div class="content">Congratulations on book publication. Just checked, it IS up on Amazon.<br>How should forum members find the discount code? ( OK, I'm being cheap, is already a great low price )</div>

<div class="content">matthewS:<br>The discount price is only from Hyperink, not Amazon. The code Is AWESOME.</div>

<div class="content">@Mark: I'd like to see a new forum for The Path to Awesomenes topics. It would encourage dialogue about the issues, promote the book, and separate the issues from all the time management discussions.</div>

<div class="content">t's easy enough to start a new forum, but I don't want to do so if it's not going to be used. What do other people think? (The number of answers to this question will give me an indication of the probable usage)</div>

<div class="content">I vote for no new forums. The FV forum is already rather moribund. Perhaps preface the topic subject with PATH: or somesuch? I rather like the messiness of the current forum. <br><br>To my mind, creating a new forum is similar to giving priority codes to tasks, which Mark argues against.</div>

<div class="content">There doesn't seem to be an overwhelming desire for a new forum, so I'm going to leave it as it is for the time being. The General Forum is of course available for Pathway to Awesomeness topics.<br><br>Also I would point out that all the articles in the book are to be found on the blog, so you could always comment on the article itself. New blog comments are reflected in the side bar.</div>
