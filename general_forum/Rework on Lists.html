<div class="content">My elder son started a company late last year, I've been giving him a hand on various issues.  <br><br>It's early days, but it's been a fascinating journey so far.  In the UK, Gareth and me, in South Africa his colleague in Durban and HIS colleague in Cape Town.  The two latter guys run a web development company, so they've helped set up the web site and other related stuff.<br><br>They encouraged us to use a couple of applications that facilitate co-operation and progress via the Web.  One of these applications is Basecamp, a project management and communications facility, developed by 37signals; no, I have no idea from where the software people got that name..<br><br>It's been quite a learning experience for an old dog like me, but it IS amazing to work firsthand with tools one only reads about usually.<br><br>The folk of 37signals have just brought out a second book, Rework, on lessons learned and how others could go about things.  Yes, it's another business success story book, but this one is quite good.<br><br>Here is an extract from their 1.5 pages on Lists which illustrates a couple of aspects which we know about on this forum, thanks to Mark's original ideas:<br><br>"Long Lists don't Get Done" is the section title on page 126, with a tasks checklist in the background.<br><br>"Long lists are guilt trips.  The longer the list of unfinished items, the worse you feel about it. . . . . There's a better way. Break down that long list into a bunch of smaller lists."<br><br>Sounds like DWM to me. more so than AF!<br><br>More: "Yes, you still have the same amount of stuff left to do.  But now you can look at the small picture and find satisfaction, motivation, and progress.  That's a lot better than staring at the huge picture and being terrified and demoralized. . . . . Don't prioritize with numbers or labels. . . . . Instead prioritize VISUALLY (my capitals)." <br><br>Have a look for this book at the airport, better than Dan Brown and other textual chewing gum.  These guys are successful mavericks. <br><br>www.37signals.com/rework</div>

<div class="content">Something that's occurred to me is that DWM is like a cross between AF and a tickler file.<br><br>The smart way to use a tickler is to work forward where possible and get pending things done in advance, as is done in DWM.<br><br>I prefer to sort into categories; to do today, and to do in general.<br><br>Even so the 'general' list is getting a bit messy, perhaps I need to break out and create project areas and leave the rest for  miscellaneous stuff</div>

<div class="content">That's an interesting observation which I recognise because I have been doing DWM manually for the last 10 or so days and obeying the rules, most of the time.  I have to be honest and state that my ListPro version was not done as well, so for me for the foreseeable future, manual/paper is the best so far of any task management system I have ever used.<br><br>When I started the current way, I did so in accordance with the rules, but I have to say it's worrying to see so many pages from the original 28 days (which is my timespan) with so little on them.<br><br>As others have sensibly advised, dumping all the tasks on Day 28 from the start is not advisable.  Instead of spreading them over the "new" 28th day, I have indeed spread them over the original 8 - 28 days where possible.<br><br>I am also entering  a few tasks in today or a bit later as they do need to be done soon.  It's a practical tweak which I try to minimise as the beauty of DWM is the closed list effect on pages 1 - 6, 8 - 27.<br><br>It's working well so far and I'm now tracking the stats to make sure I do improve my performance, eg yesterday saw 17 tasks on the page, 15 were dealt with, 2 re-entered on day 7.<br><br>In setting up a convenient way to measure my DWM progress, I have noticed the tickler effect AND in advance, as you point out, SP!<br><br>I want to share my manual/paper methodology later on once it has been running for ab out two months.<br><br>However, I will still use my computer for hard dates, reminders and for breaking projects down into manageable chunk and tracking these, unless manual/paper proves better in projects as well.<br><br>I will cease the cheating practice when I get to the original day 29, around 28 April</div>
