<div class="content">A strange thing is happening to me.<br><br>A week ago I decided to go back to AF1, along with my REVERSE tweaks. Every page a closed list, dismiss when no item stands out, et cetera et cetera. <br><br>But... It simply did not happen. Before I realized it, I had drawn the AF2 dismissal line every morning. Later I "just had to look for the last page again". And so on. The lists in my notebook didn't want to be closed again.<br><br>Final score: I didn't manage to go back, not for 1 single day!<br><br>It seems my subconscious likes AF2 more than I was aware of. So, next week I'll try to move deliberately forward and follow the AF2 rules by the book. Maybe it's just that I have to overcome my "last page weakness" (or "glueness"). I'll TRAIN myself to go back through the pages more decisively, by REALLY pointing and looking at every item on the list one after the other, waiting for the "standing out".<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Interesting! I loved AF1 but when Jacqueline suggested I revert to it to clear some old pages I had a real aversion to the thought.  And here it is, nearly 2:00 am, and what am I doing but AF2 and "check forum"!  How sad am I?</div>

<div class="content">Even more strange...<br><br>I seriously intended to go AF2 – and suddenly the block was away, I could easily move backwards through my pages (as described in REVERSE AF) and got a whole lot of things done today that have been waiting for weeks. I even dismissed a page!<br><br>Felt good.</div>
