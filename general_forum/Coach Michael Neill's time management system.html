<div class="content">His system works like this:<br><br>1. Take 2 pieces of paper<br>2. On the first page write “The only thing I have to do today is . . .”<br>3. On the second page make a list of everything you want to get done in the next week or so. Include, all you regular “to dos”, everything you’ve got to do for work and at home,  as well as the things you think you’d like to do if you had more time.<br>4. When it’s time to do the things on your list just choose ONE item. Choose the one that appeals to you most and write it on the first page. Do it as though it’s the only thing you have to do today.<br>5. When you complete it cross it off both lists.<br>6. Choose the next thing that appeals from the second list and transfer it to the first page.<br><br>And keep repeating.<br><br>I was struck by how similar it is to Mark's "standing out" process.</div>

<div class="content">I really like this. Im thinking it would keep things fresh. Also, I like the one week interval. <br><br>T'is the time to drool over 2012 notebooks etc. This might be the perfect excuse to get me one of those.</div>

<div class="content"><<that would have been about 1999>><br><br>There's no doubt in my mind that a few of your concepts have been pillaged/borrowed and integrated into other systems. I'm thinking about: <br><br>* dismissal<br>* little and often<br>* standing out</div>

<div class="content">There is a lot of brian Tracy in this. Just for memory BT lets you make 3 lists. One for today, one for the week and one over a week (can be one year) then in each list (and first in the daily list you have to make a priority A,B, C, D then in each 1,2, 3... so you begin by A1 do all of it then do A2, do all of it and so on.... All of this is piloted by the definition of yours goals. I am testing the method but I added active projects and notes folders. All works with paper folders for the moment. <br><br>Anyway I noticed working with this method that it is quiet efficient. Each night I make the list for tomorrow, each wednesday the list for newt week and I follow my goals. <br><br>I also noticed that when a new project happens i.e. for me a new building or a new client taking a new sheet of paper and writing all on this single sheet save me a lot off time. I only have to drop in my paper active project and it is ok. I can then come back later on the project and works on it.  <br><br>In  MICHAEL NEILL'S TIME MANAGEMENT SYSTEM, I like the idea of having one task to do on a sheet of paper so you can focus on it and use you weekly list as a weekly guide line eventually read when you with the AF way. So If you don't know where to put an item (i.e. it is not necessary to do in IN THE WEEK) you can put it in your OVER ONE WEEK LIST which can be like a ware house of tasks. <br><br>Finally all these methods TRACY, NEILS, FOSTER, ALLEN has common principle :<br>1. List of tasks (Collecting and planning)<br>2. Liste of project and sheet of project (one by one) <br>3. TIKLER or agenda reporting of important events for the FUTURE,<br>4. GOAL'S MAKING and PLANNING<br>5. TIME RESERVED for working on your Goals, yours projects, yours tasks, your or own organization, <br>6. ACTION on these tasks and projects relevant to your GOALS, <br>7. CONTROL on this tasks, GOALS and so on (GTD/ Weekly review, TRACY review, FORSTER review) <br><br>the way to do it is not complicated. It obeys to rules. May be I forgot some you may complete.<br><br>Finally it begins clear for me. This forum helps me a lot to understand this.</div>

<div class="content">On reflection I think I'd want to add something about what KIND of day or week, or QUALITY I'd want it to have as well - such as "calm", or "flow" or "adventuresome" or "excitement and enthusiasm". I think we need a parallel blog to "Get Everything Done" such as "Be How you Want (while you're doing and getting things done)". A project for you Mark?</div>

<div class="content">michael - more than anyone else, I find your ideas/thinking similar to my own. I have flirted with the idea of creating themes for weeks, but haven't put it into practice yet. I can envision one week being "centered", another "facing fear". I've also though about combining themes with some form of a metric i.e. measuring mood, sleep, etc., to gauge which theme has the greatest impact. Lots to think about. <br><br>Because of this thread, I'm reintroducing the Action Journal - <a href="http://www.theurbanshogun.com/2011/03/behance-action-journal-review.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.theurbanshogun.com/2011/03/behance-action-journal-review.html</a>  <br><br>Purchased for it's beauty, but I now have a system (Neill's) that fits the layout. I'll use the right side check-lists to capture my "“The only thing I have to do today is . . .” tasks.</div>

<div class="content">Maybe I'm missing something but isn't Michael Neill's system (as reported by michael anyway) just a list of tasks? <br><br>Writing down each task before you do it on another sheet of paper is something you could do with any system.</div>

<div class="content"><<isn't Michael Neill's system (as reported by michael anyway) just a list of tasks>><br><br>I'll share my thinking on this idea: <br><br>1. The weekly mind dump (2nd Page) keeps things fresh and current (I'll redo my list once a week). This touches on your idea of dismissal & Brian Tracy's concept of rewriting to clarify what's important. <br><br>2. Asking yourself: "“The only thing I have to do today is . . .” is agnostic vis-a-vis the "why" of what must get done. On Monday, it might be guilt and fear that drives my "one thing". On Tuesday, an awareness of avoidance and fear that propels me to choose a scary task. <br><br>3. Staring at ONE item helps me focus and avoid overwhelm. <br><br>4. Metrics: At the end of the week, you should have a clear idea of what meaningful things were accomplished. <br><br>I've used Eternity (excellent time tracking app) before, and using it again to monitor my daily activity.</div>

<div class="content">Mark/avrum: <<just a list of tasks? >><br><br>well yes, and no. I think the benefits of various time management systems are more in how they frame the task list for you. The beauty of your systems Mark is that (for me at least) I often get and unburdening feeling and an ease in selecting tasks by what stands out. I think this is where avrum makes explicit the benefits of Steve Chandler's system. Time management is then more like advertising : the "list of tasks" needs to be available in a value-added (perceived-value) way. All the variations with different notebooks, pencils, gizmo's seem to me to be the seduction of the user into a happier frame of mind for approaching their activities.</div>

<div class="content">Regarding the Quality or Kind of week I want to have:<br><br>Back in 2008 I chose a virtue each week. On Wednesdays I would reflect back over how well I held to that virtue, and then think ahead to how I could best hold the next one, including times I knew it would be challenged.<br><br>I used Benjamin Franklin's 13 values, <br><a href="http://cricketb.wordpress.com/2008/09/14/daily-virtue/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://cricketb.wordpress.com/2008/09/14/daily-virtue/</a><br>and then the 7 Christian Virtues, then got out of the habit.<br><br>Another list could be life areas, what some call wheel of life spokes, what Covey calls Roles. Pick one each week and ensure it gets attention. This is important even for roles that I seem to be doing well with; often it seems I'm doing well, but what I'm actually doing is sliding.<br><br>Cricket</div>

The trouble is that the effect wears off very quickly.<br><br>It's the same with saying things like “The only thing I have to do today is . . .” It give you a real boost initially, but after you've said it fifty times a day for a week it's definitely not having quite the same effect.<br><br>The good time management system is one that you can keep using day-in day-out, week-in-week out, year-in year-out.

I think DIT and to some extent the first version of AF both would have represented the simple alternative to GTD which so many found overly complicated.   Additionally, GTD tends to appeal to a more detail and technically oriented group whereas AF and DIT a different personality type.  I also don't think you can ignore the fact David Allen has continually marketed GTD through TV show appearances, seminars, consulting gigs and several follow up books and products to keep it in the limelight.<br><br>I actually think much has been lost looking to create a perfect system.  I have been happy to accept the limits of systems and have enjoyed the time not spent looking for perfection or maintaining a more complex system that does it all.<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content"><<I also don't think you can ignore the fact David Allen>><br><br>To my mind, the stability of GTD is a huge draw. When you're feeling out of sorts, you're looking for grounding in a solid idea, product and/or person. For me, the never ending changes that have taken place here create dis-ease for whatever system I was trying. I'd think: "Hm, a better one has come along". Or, "I want to keep up with the comments so I'm going to adopt the new system". <br><br>And yet, markforster.net is my sole incubator... my think-tank for dreaming and task management. That's partly due to Mark's work, and partly due to what I pick up from the folks here.</div>

<div class="content">For Gtd is a good basis system. The idea of project s, the reviews the tickler are some great ideas I use everyday. But context never worked with me. Mf systems are indeed intuitive and interesting . This forum too because By our work and sharing experiences we find our own way of doing things little by little. Even if i often change of system i kepts the pinciple i spoke about in this thread what i call on november 6 the common principle i could call the golden principle. You know what after my work on paper i again return to my ipad adopting the principle i have tested on paper. And anyway it works ! It is faster and i avoid any loose of information. I finally adopted evernote for projects and omnifocus for actionable tasks but of is much lighter now. Instead of context i choose today, tommorrow, this week, next week, this month and over this month. It is much better and i like it. Hope this can help</div>

<div class="content">I've done the same too in the past.  It's fun fiddling with systems.  The problem is when the fiddling becomes more prominent than getting stuff done, and when extra stuff is added to the systems to provide fuel for more fiddling.<br><br>At some point even David Allen has to put his heavily marketed planning notebooks down, get up from his carefully arranged office, and do things that need doing like taking out the rubbish and mowing the grass.  If they're not getting done then the system doesn't mean jack.<br><br>That's why I've eventually realised that to get things done, you don't need a fancy system, you don't need DA's merchandise and you don't need an elaborate set of rules.  You just need to knuckle down and put in the work to get them done.  If there's resistance then there are probably a million more interesting things you could be doing.  But if you care enough about *this* thing to have it in a system, then you need to grit your teeth and get stuck in, because it will not get done any other way.<br><br>Either resolve to really get it done, or remove it from the system that you use, and from your mind and your life because it won't get done.  Completion is king.  Life is too short to have tasks hanging around for weeks not getting done but constantly nudging you for attention.<br><br>The project focus system I use now is good for this.  It lets you take three things that you care enough about to want to get done, define what getting them done actually means, and then do them at whatever pace works for those projects.<br><br>By the way this is not a rant and not aimed at you or anyone else.  Just some observations which I think are sometimes treated as the elephant in the room.  I like to fiddle with systems as much as anyone else here but the only way to get some things done is to accept you're going to get dirty and it won't be fun at the time, but will feel good when it's over.  Then get your mental overalls on and get going.</div>

<div class="content">Chris L,<br><br>Great post.  I think what some people loose is the idea that systems don't do work, people do. A few years back I analyzed why I needed a TM system and what my goals were with it.  After thinking about it, all I really could come up with was that I could not remember all I had to do or wanted to someday do.  So for me the 80/20 was just simply to write stuff down.  I then realized that I was sort of disorganized, so I decided I should stick to one place to write stuff.  After years of trying, so other addition or modification to anything I have done has yielded as much benefit as these two simple rules.  The next trick is to simply review the "system" and plug away at the items on the list like you suggest.<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">Chris L / Gerry<br><br>I don't really understand remarks like "systems don't do work, people do". I mean just what do you think all the hard-working people on this Forum are doing - ticking tasks off their lists without taking any action?<br><br>As for why you might want a time management system, here's my prospectus for the Final Version:<br><br>    - It is a “universal capture” system into which you can put all your ideas for action without prior editing.<br>    - Tasks are sifted and filtered by working the system itself.<br>    - It produces the most productive degree of tension between the intuitive unconscious mind and the rational mind.<br>    - It removes procrastination by ensuring that you are psychologically ready to do each task.<br>    - It automatically removes tasks which are going nowhere.<br>    - It allows one to judge exactly whether one has the right workload and provides automatic adjustment of the workload to fit the time available.<br>    - It enables you to deal efficiently with both urgent tasks and “must do” tasks without less pressing tasks being ignored.<br>    - It deals highly effectively with tasks which recur daily or at greater or lesser intervals.<br>    - It ensures that once you have started a task, however large or small, you work through to completion.<br>    - It is simple to operate and has minimal overhead.<br>    - It makes one’s work feel effortless, while being extremely productive.<br>    - It makes use of available periods of time, however short.<br>    - It ensures that the important tasks get done so that you are not just processing loads of trivia.<br>    - Tasks and projects can be put into the system at any level.<br>    - There is no need for time-consuming reviews or pre-selection of tasks.<br>    - Although it is designed as a paper-and-pen system it can easily be implemented electronically.</div>

I mean just what do you think all the hard-working people on this Forum are doing - ticking tasks off their lists without taking any action?"<br><br>That's backwards post-hoc logic; I've suggested no such thing.  I'm responding to avrum writing "In a different way... the culture of GTD is crazy making (again, for me). I start looking for next actions and projects were none exist. I start sublimating creative energy into my system. Truth be told, I've done the same thing with some of your systems."<br><br>I'm saying that fiddling with systems, looking for the perfect system, running systems which start to come apart after a couple of weeks... these are all things which can be used in lieu of doing the tasks in those systems.  It's another form of procrastination and resistance, the quest for the perfect system.<br><br>That doesn't mean that to get things done people don't need systems or lists, only that the systems must supplement the person's own honest desire to complete things.  I see too many people - and I'd previously count myself amongst them - who feel that putting something in a system is enough to trigger it to get done, then it sits there for months moving around and going nowhere.  The elephant in the room as I put it.  Everyone knows it happens but few change their behaviour to fix it.<br><br>I was pointing out that getting your hands dirty is the only way something ultimately gets done.  That doesn't mean that a system cannot assist in pulling out what needs to be done, nor that the people here don't benefit from your systems.</div>

<div class="content">Chris L:<br>I absolutelly agree and I think everybody enjoying this forum knows what you are speaking about. Still, I do not see it as "either A, or B" problem: continuously searching for "perfect" time management/life management system is just one more activity in our never ending, only half-realistic but I believe necessary endeavor to  try to control one`s life little bit more, to be effective little bit more, to increase our life satisfaction little bit more etc. I am also still searching for new methods and upgrading my systems and at the same time using my current and still evolving system for doing tasks. <br><br>And I know this "upgrading and searching" is often not very effective, sometimes it might be loss of time, sometimes definitely avoidance.. I know that in case I would focus my energy to other tasks, I might have more done. But - I like it. It is fun. It is my hobby. And it motivates me not only to continuously think about myself, my efficacy, my balance and about upgrading my system, but ALSO (I hope) in the end to do more tasks or to do them better. So I think middle position, as usually, is the best - not procrastinating by only polishing your system endlessly, but also to allow yourself to do what you like - which in our case is (I suspect) theorizing, testing and experimenting on time management.</div>

<div class="content">Or, to put it in other words: I view our time management systems as part of ourselves, not as something detached from ourselves. It is all one "working system": me, my values, my projects, my roles, and my system how to handle it. The more these systems conforms to my personality and my approaches how to handle tasks, the better. That is why I believe GTD has really keen fans, and TWC has really keen fans, and Mark also. And that is why I also think that as our approach, life roles, projects or personality change, our system should reflect this and should be also modified to conform to this new conditions. That is why I am fan of searching for new effective TM systems and evaluating them because I believe that by elaborating on them, you also elaborate on your situation, your attitudes, your effectiveness = your personality. And it is always good job (if it is not exaggerated) to work on yourself, isn`t it?</div>

If something takes an hour it takes an hour whether you use, nothing, GTD or DIT.  I was also referring to the point that sometimes people want their system to do too much like prioritizing, which I don't leave up a system.

This is at least as good a method as using your left-brain logical non-intuitive thinking to work out priorities.<br><br><< Every moment we spend searching for systems or using a system is time spent not doing a task.>><br><br>Every moment spent improving your systems will repay you hundreds of times over in time saved. and that doesn't just apply to time management systems.<br><br><< I agree that no system is a system.

<div class="content">MF: "What I was getting at is that we are all aware that people do the work. We also know that systems don't do the work.  But what we do need reminding of is that people always do the work by using some form of system. ... The more effective our systems are the more effective our work is going to be."<br><br>I agree with everything you say in this reply.  I already wrote: "That doesn't mean that to get things done people don't need systems or lists, only that the systems must supplement the person's own honest desire to complete things."<br><br>The "dis-ease" comes from expecting the systems to act as a magical push to finally get that stubborn thing done.  If you don't have the resolve to really do it you're kidding yourself.  A system might help clarify the context of that resolve and make it possible, which is fine, but otherwise it's just another form of procrastination; even worse it's "legitimised" because after all it must be a problem the system.  People then go on a hunt for a better system to address it instead of modifying their behaviour and working with their system to improve both.  This can go on for years - and I speak from experience!<br><br>I like playing with different systems and agree with Daneb's comments.  It's like tinkering in a garage but you still need an appropriate vehicle to get you around the way you need to.  I am looking forward to getting your book and having a play with your Final Version.</div>

<div class="content">I love new systems. And most any of them make things easier and more fun, and over and over again I think I have found THE WAY. The very fact that they make things genuinely easier and make life and work rip along, makes it even harder when the shiny gloss wears off of them and I am left with myself and a shit load of work. Sort of a crash and burn. I can tell because suddenly I have a giant desire to avoid my lists and my system. Stale. Onerous. Boring. So then I switch systems. <br><br>Mark's focus systems are really great because they do get past the procrastination and at first there is such an excitement and pleasure in doing work/things/stuff. Exhilarating. Then, for me, there is that thing that sets in and I can't face my lists. NOTHING stands out, or there is a mountain of work crushing down on me that I have to get done.<br><br>Like Chris L. says, There is nothing to do but roll up my sleeves and wade in. Sometimes I think I would be way better off without the illusion of a new system doing half of the heavy lifting for me, or actually having made it FUN for me--for a day or two. <br><br>And this pattern repeats itself. And, I love nothing better than reading this forum. I love nothing better than rolling into a new or tweaked system or doing a brain dump. But I always end up back at the same place.</div>

<div class="content">"I don't see how a system makes the act of calling for a doctors appointment take less time."<br><br>For example: your system gives you a full overview of what times you have available, so there's no bantering over maybe being free.  Or if it's a specialist and you have to take whatever they give, the system quickly enables you to identify and reschedule conflicts.<br><br>Many many tasks are influenced by a system's aptitude.  And that's not even counting the mental support, and the difference feeling READY makes in how quickly you work.</div>

<div class="content">Gerry:<br><br><< I was referring to tasks. >><br><br>So was I.<br><br><<I don't see how a system makes the act of calling for a doctors appointment take less time. >><br><br>Actually that's a very good example of the sort of task that can be really messed up if you don't have good systems. If you don't file telephone numbers where you can find them, if you haven't kept your doctor's registration up to date, both things which you will or won't have done according to how good your systems are, then you will spend twice as much time in the actual process of doing it. <br><br>Added to that is the procrastination time if you are resisting going to the doctor. This can go on for years as many people on this list can probably testify. A good system will enable you to overcome this resistance.<br><br>And then if you are going to call for an emergency appointment you probably need to call first thing, so you need a good reminder system. Otherwise you will miss your chance.<br><br><< I am not sure what side of the brain is helping me pick the next task, I am just sure my brain is doing it and not a system. >><br><br>Well, I'm sure it's your brain too, but as I've already said your brain works best if you have good systems. Humans are tool-using animals, and systems are tools.<br><br><< Yes, but many spend time "trying" to improve systems and not actually improving them or working on systems and then abandoning them. >><br><br>I'd be interested to know what your evidence is for this. <br><br><< This seems to me lost time better spent doing a task. >><br><br>Most significant advances in systems of any kind don't just fall out of the sky. Learning from things that don't work is an essential part of living.</div>

Just going on scanning the list according to whichever system you are using and applying the rules. If you end up dismissing the entire list so be it, but in fact it never comes to that.</div>
