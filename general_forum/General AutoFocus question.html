<div class="content">I practice an instrument (casually--so no scheduled practice times), and I've got back and forth on the best way to enter practice tasks in AF.<br><br>I've tried just listing "Practice music"--which leaves me open to anything in the stack to practice.<br><br>Also, specifically, "Practice Song A", with a dozen or songs I want to get to.<br><br>Any thoughts on the best way to approach this? Thanks!</div>

<div class="content">Sort your stack according to what you want to practice.  Just list "Practice music". If that's not enough, enter the specific song or songs you want to practice soon.</div>

<div class="content">I believe Mark's guidelines for something like music lessons (or learning a language) is to set an appointment on your calendar for when you want to practice, and then use the calendar to drive your practicing, not AF.<br><br>As for what to practice -- why not put the songs in a stack, sort through them one at a time, and practice the one that stands out as something you'd like to practice right now?</div>

<div class="content">Yes, I think I was just overthinking it--trying to get specific songs into the AF rotation... Thanks for the replies!</div>

<div class="content">I guess it all depends just how casual you want your music practice to be.<br><br>If you are practising just in order to enjoy playing with no particular aim in mind then I'd put "Practise Music" in AF, and then have a list of tunes and just pick out whichever stands out to practise (as Mike suggests).<br><br>If you are doing this for a specific purpose, then you need to be more systematic. Set aside specific practice times, and set specific goals for your practising. Taking a bit of time to sit down and work out exactly what types of practice will best serve your purposes is a useful exercise in itself.<br><br>For any significant advance your practice needs to be purposeful.<br><br>(In case any of you are wondering about the inconsistencies in my spelling, in British spelling it's "practice" when it's a noun and "practise" when it's a verb).</div>
