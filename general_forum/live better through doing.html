<div class="content">I asked chatgpt: "act as mark forster of autofocus. your view of combining with what kind of day i want" <br><br>[edited] reply:<br><br>Before you even open your notebook or task list, ask:<br><br>What kind of day do I want?<br><br>What would make today satisfying or meaningful?<br><br>What do I feel drawn to right now?<br><br>With your day feeling in mind, scan the list. Your mind will naturally highlight tasks that align with the kind of day you want.<br><br>Don’t overthink it. A few intuitive words or images are enough: calm, productive, creative, light, clearing space, etc.<br><br>And if your vision of the day changes — if you suddenly want a more focused, deep-work kind of day — that’s allowed. You’re not locked in.<br><br>The best use of AutoFocus is not just to get things done — it’s to live better through doing.<br><br>Me: I now take a moment to consider the direction or feeling I want the day to have, not just the list of tasks. That feeling or direction gets written at the top of the current AF1 list to make it concrete. I've found it lets me bounce between tasks and mood. I like it.</div>
