<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-07-20 21:21</div>
<div class="content">First, a little background on my situation: I work as an independent consultant, often in some strange places and sometimes with questionable people, to paraphrase the BBC's John Simpson.  I work abroad away from my UK home base in mainly developing/transition or recovering countries from A (Afghanistan) to Z (Zambia).   I currently in the final week of another assignment in Nicaragua.<br>My assignments last from one week (rare) to three months or more, preferably the latter as the frequent long distance flying in cattle class is wearing my ageing frame.<br>No, thank goodness, I'm not in the private security business, I work with water utilities in non-engineering issues, such as management, business planning, accounting, commercial, information systems, performance management etc, usually under the umbrella of "institutional strengthening".<br><br>I've been using AF since the very first beta day and I reckon I will stay with AF, it's been by far the most effective system I've used in a long working life.  Like so many others on this active forum, I find it necessary to modify/tweak things to suit what I think works for me, but I probably experiment a bit too much, perhaps the perfectionist inside me which contributes to my ongoing combat against procrastination.  I've tried the electronic approach, but returned to paper, now using a Moleskine hard cover medium size notebook with a Bic metal black gel pen (Parker refills) and highlighters.  I also carry a small pocket notebook for errands, jotting down stuff when my AF notebook isn’t with me, which is rare; the AF notebook fits nicely into a side pocket in my new Redoxx Airborne C-Ruc backpack (I haul my notebook computer, camera, document folders, medication and some spares, supplies etc in this cabin bag, in case my check-in luggage gets lost).<br><br>I like AF2 and the concept of one long list, not page units.  I resisted, as Mark recommended, the temptation to copy outstanding items from AF1, but applied the underline approach on such items ie AF1 became a sort of a backlog list.<br><br>Although I started off AF2 as a new list, I found myself drifting into jotting down and adding to the list everything that comes into my head.  I don't have a problem with reminders for hard date items, I stick those into Outlook 2007).  So my list has become longer and longer, more akin to a rambling to-do list.<br><br>I continued my AF1 practice of highlighting in yellow items which cannot be physically or practically done in my present location, wherever that might be.  Completed or partly processed items are struck through with the pen and highlighted in green.  Dismissed items are highlighted in pink.  I have found that during scanning I can pick out the untouched items quickly (each item starts with a dash, converted into a vertical cross when processed). <br><br>BUT my list was still growing and started to get cluttered with yellow items which I called "Defer To Do Later", not because I will procrastinate with them, but because I cannot do them in my current physical context.  As I write this draft, I have no Internet access in the office, so no email, no Skype etc.<br><br>So I've set up "context-specific" lists at the back of my AF notebook.  The front part is the "main" active AF list, right-hand pages only, left-hand for meeting notes, messages, or creative doodling.  I am ,listing on these context or back list pages items which I have to do there or which can only be done at the context (yes, I've also tried GTD, AF beats it hands down, but GTD does have some useful concepts).<br><br>Every day I tend to work only on my main AF list, but if I think of something that needs to be done elsewhere, it is entered on the relevant context list.  These various context lists thus feed the main list as I move into the next context, yet I have already noted many of the items  and they do not clog up my main AF list.  I can cross them off in the context list when I transfer them to the main AF list.<br><br>I believe this gives me more focus, maybe make my list more amenable to DIT practice, as I don't have to worry about even seeing those items in another context.<br><br>As an indication of my contexts, here are some of the context lists with a couple of examples:<br><br>- Home Office eg draft accounts for review, new passport application<br>- Home Stuff eg go through writing bureau, tidy garage, new exercise routine<br>- Home Errands eg rain cover for backpack, get new sunglasses<br>- Next Assignment eg check local accommodation, packing check list etc<br>- Wish/Maybe List Work/Office: enhance Word skills for report drafts, NAS options<br>- Wish/Maybe List Personal: YouTube account, redo wall pictures<br><br>I even have a context "Travel" eg when returning home from Zambia where the Internet access had been very slow and flaky, I earmarked some tasks to be done at Johannesburg international Airport during a six hour layover when I knew I would have a good connection in the KLM Lounge - one of these tasks was to submit my online VAT return in the nick of time!<br><br>For those of you still awake and in similar situations - extended periods away from home or usual work base - maybe you could tell how you tackle your circumstances, if they warrant special treatment.<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Roger J<br><br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Roger, I do this electronically and have quite a few more contexts. I have called AF2 the missing GTD link. You keep your context lists, but you work them little-and-often, using both reason and intuition, and you use dismissal rules. It's the perfect approach for me.</div>

You stated:<br><br>"For those of you still awake and in similar situations ...."<br><br>RogerJ, what you do is extraordinary!  I don't think you're going to find very many people with your level of mettle and dedication......Your situation isn't ever going to be "similar"....you're one of that blessed 1% of the population what the rest of us reveres and marvels at!

<div class="content">Roger,<br><br>>>>  Although I started off AF2 as a new list, I found myself drifting into jotting down and adding to the list everything that comes into my head. I don't have a problem with reminders for hard date items, I stick those into Outlook 2007). So my list has become longer and longer, more akin to a rambling to-do list.  <<<<br><br>This is what I identified as the root of my problems with AF2.  (It existed as a potential problem with AF1, but did not really gum up the works as it did with AF2 because AF2 does not operate on the page level and that allows for virtually unlimited growth.)<br><br>There is a concept in time management called a "grass catcher list".  I've used one for years.  Basically I keep a notebook open at all times to catch those fleeting bits of "grass" that the lawn mower of my productivity engine throws off ;-)  It helps keep my mind clear.  Without it and with my ADD, I'd be off chasing bright shiny objects all day (as if I already don't ;-)<br><br>Periodically, I go through the grass catcher, cross off those items which magically got done, and move the others to more appropriate (read organized) homes ... such as someday/maybe, projects lists, etc.<br><br>Now the problem occurs because the way AF works it is not only a TO DO list, but functions as a grass catcher as well.  This is NOT a good thing, as you have noted.  It does not seem bad in the beginning, but as the list grows progressively longer, populated with all kinds of flotsam and jetsam, it just bogs down.  Yes, AF itself acts as a filter with the dismissal rules purging the list eventually ... but the problem is EVENTUALLY.  Before that happens, I'm mired in the muck of all of this random stuff.<br><br>My solution to this (in ways I've not completely firmed up yet) is to apply a first level filter BEFORE the AF list.  IOW, take a moment to identify if this is a genuine TO DO (in the foreseeable future) or really needs to go straight onto the "someday/maybe" list or a particular project list.  I've got some ideas of how I want to manage this, but I'm not firm on any of it yet.  One solution might be to add some coding to the AF list so I'll know stuff that needs to be dismissed quickly when I'm in a position to fuss with list overhead.  IOW, not keep all of my lists and such open all the time, but mark them for later.  I hate to add more stuff to AF, but I also hate to be walking about with multiple books ... or to be distracted with copying stuff whenever I'm hit by a random thought ... which happens in the millisecond time frame most days ;-)  So maybe tags like "SM", "P", etc. to tell me these items are to be ignored and moved ASAP.  Or maybe a highlight to accomplish the same thing, i.e. a pink highlight means that this needs to be dismissed soon and moved to some other list.  It should only take a second while writing the item down to determine this and mark it leaving me free to stick to a single AF list which functions more smoothly.<br><br>Just my thinking at this moment.  I expect to have my system in place and fully operational this weekend.  But that was the big show stopper for me.  That satori will lead me to the nirvana of unlimited productivity in the near future ... I'm quite sure of it.  Yes I am.  Really, I am ;-).</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>>>>  Don't forget that deleting an item because you've decided not to do it at all counts as taking action on it. <<<<br><br>I'm not sure how that helps.  My focus is getting things OFF of the AF list (as is everyone's I guess ;-)  IOW what is causing my list to grow without bound is that many of the items on it should not be there at all ... but they are, and they act to keep me from cycling through the list quickly.<br><br>I was not in much trouble when I had my trusty old (pre AF) TO DO list along side of my grass catcher list.  Who cares if my grass catcher grows without bound?  It is not in the way of my TO DO list!  The game is to keep the TO DO list small enough to be operationally effective.<br><br>I got into trouble because crap got onto the AF list ... "crap" being defined is things which are not things I intended to do, in any reasonable time frame ;-)  As you said to me elsewhere "don't put everything on the AF list".  Well, you are right ... I need to keep stuff from cluttering up my AF list.<br><br>I have no problem deleting things from the list that "I've decided not to do", as you put it.  My problem is in letting them live on the list and clutter it up for too long.  Ideally, I'd want them to never get on the list in the first place.  Baring that (because of not wanting to carry YADL (yet another damn list ;-) I would want to isolate them as soon as possible pending my deleting them and moving them to a more appropriate place.<br><br>I have not taken the time to count them, but I'm guessing that a significant number of things that are on my AF list really should  not be there at all.  The longer they live there, the longer they get in my way, keeping me from seeing what I really DO want to do, and keeping me from getting back to those things at the beginning of the list (AF2) or the end of the list (AF1).<br><br>All of that said, I'm hoping that simply marking the "grass" in some way will have the effect of operationally removing them from the list UNTIL that time when they can be ACTUALLY removed ... by moving them to another place and crossing them off of the AF list.<br><br>Time will tell, I guess.<br><br>I wonder if there is some kind of upper limit for AF2.  I suspect it is an individual matter, but an interesting question, nonetheless.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>In the same vein, can I also 'prematurely' dismiss an item?  There are items that, on review, I really don't want to do now but may do at some future point.  My highlighted (ie dismissed) items also act as a Someday/Maybe list so I'd prefer not to delete them and add them to another SM list. I think it may be useful to be able to highlight these type of items before the line reaches them.<br><br>Thanks<br><br>Andy</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike<br><br>Interesting comments about redifining your "system".  I found that AF1 itself enabled me to redefine my system of working - in some ways similar to yours but in others diametrically opposed.  AF2 has made me rethink some of those peripheral systems (more akin to project management really) and I am at the point where the "perfect system" is hovering just outside my peripheral vision.  I know what I want to achieve - I know it is achievable, I know roughly what it will look like - just need to see the last piece and fill in the gaps ........ :-)</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Mark<br><br>I just liked that aspect of AF1 where I would end up dismissing a number of items at once but which would still be kept on my radar screen for future review (ie highlighted).  <br><br>My only concern with AF2 was that it wasn't dismissing items quickly enough so that my list kept on growing.  Knowing that I can dismiss items anywhere and anytime on the list probably gets around that problem.  My only slight concern with doing that was that I may not have been allowing those items to enough review time.<br><br>Andy<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark and AndyC<br><br>I already wondered about dismissing items before they are dismissed by the system. Most of these items were thrown at the system as "wow, what a nice idea" (or bright shiny objects as Mike calls them, I tend to chase them, too). But quite soon I realise that yes, it's a nice idea, but I don't want to act on it right now. Instead of looking at the item again and again until it's dismissed and let it tempt me to start right now, I'd like to mark it as "don't bother right now, but there may be a day when you want to start thinking about it again".</div>

<div class="content">Mike, why are you opposed to using a grass cratcher list with AF2? I am realizing that I list individual fluff and fun tasks on my list which has the result of me doing more of these than the meatier tasks. I am considering making a separate recreational list and then just noting recreation on my main AF2 list. I think that may have the effect of keeping the amount of time I spend rewarding myself in check. FWIW, this forum will be on the list. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike<br>I keep my rolling list (throw anything at it list) quarantined from my action list as well.  I used to use a roll of computer mailing labels and transfer them to their appropriate place.  Eventually I was able to train my eyes to glace past the crossouts.  It's generally called a Master List, but mine got dubbed the rolling list because it used to be a roll of computer labels!  LOL!  I found that most of this is stuff that gets nixed.....sounded important or genius at the time, but upon review, didn't pass muster.

<div class="content">Thanks. EVERYONE above, I admire your tenacity in getting through my verbose posting!<br><br>Some interesting feedback, typical of this Forum.  I take comfort that I am not alone in some of my self-management processes.<br><br>I agree with Mark, deciding not to do an item makes it a candidate for crossing it off.  I draw a wavy line through it, but still highlight it in green.  This preserves the pink highlighted items which I also cross through, but which will stand out on each page amidst a forest of green (hopefully). so I don't have to transfer the pink items, they will always stand out on completed, crossed-out pages.<br><br>Mike: i think you and i have much in common, I hope that's not a terribly bad thing!

<div class="content">Good Morning Mel,<br><br>>>>  Mike, what would your reaction be if Mark came up with the rule of keeping a Grass Catcher list in tandem with AF2?<br><br>I don't know.  I suppose it would make little difference to me as I'm making my own changes based on my personal experience.  I doubt I'd react to any new rules proposed by anyone unless they were rules I had not tried yet.<br><br>>>> It's so interesting to me how some people spend a lot of time trying to make the original rules work and others spend a lot of time creating new rules.

I'd give up if I thought that AF itself were the problem ... it is not!<br><br>I started out trying to make the rules work.  Then I added tweaks which mostly did not help at all.  Then I found myself with mostly native AF1 when I got back from vacation and found Mark had announced the rules for AF2.  So I switched over and was amazed at the change in productivity ... until things quickly bogged down.  Next I tried the tweaks offered by others and when it became obvious that most were missing what my real problem was ... I decided that the problem was probably systemic, and had to do with my thinking style.  So my final (for the moment ;-) solution was to review my entire system of time and goals management to be sure that everything integrated well.  It did not!  And that was the problem.  I had a disconnect in my systems.  I did not have a single integrated system, as I thought I had, but rather I had multiple systems that did not play well together.<br><br>Once I fix that, I'll be in hog heaven.  (Or so it says here in fine print.)<br><br>BTW, while my review was comprehensive, my changes will probably be very few, and mostly simple operational changes.  I don't need to redo goals and values and such ... that is all fine.  But I do have to look at how they are recorded, how well and often I review, how much time and overhead the system takes, and how much redundancy I am dealing with.  So in some ways my overhaul is simpler than it seems, but still comprehensive.</div>

<div class="content">Hey Christine,<br><br>>>>  I do wish you and I worked the same way, then I could just sit back and wait for you to find "my" answer!! :-)  <<<<br><br>ROTF ;-)  Yeah, that would be the easiest way to find the answer.<br><br>If it helps you at all ... I first defined what I wanted a time management system do to, what were its essential components.<br><br>I came up with things like:<br><br>- Hierarchy of values<br>- Long term goals<br>- Short term goals<br>- Projects<br>- Tasks<br>- Appointments / Tickers<br>- Prioritization<br>- Scheduling<br>- Execution<br>- Monitoring and Review<br>- Grass Catching<br>- Etc.<br><br>Next I reviewed how I did each of those things.  For example:<br><br>- Yearly I reviewed long term goals and developed a new list of short term goals<br>- Weekly I reviewed short term goals<br>- Then I evaluated what I wanted to accomplish in the next week<br>- I evaluated the projects coming from those goals and decided what actions I was willing to take<br>- Then I prioritized the actions<br>- Then I blocked time for the biggest and most important ones<br>- I cleared my grass catcher list (and here is where the disconnect made itself known -- I was no longer USING my grass catcher list .... WHY?)<br>- I populated my To Do list with one-of tasks that I knew were important<br>- I worked the schedule, primarily<br>- I filled in with AF when I was not in a block of work on a project.<br><br>Next I reviewed the tools I use to accomplish each of those.  For example:<br><br>- Grass Catcher list (notebook)  -- and again, I was hit with the disconnect<br>- AF (notebook)<br>- Values Hierarchy (Word)<br>- Long term goals (Word / Mind Manager)<br>- Short term goals (Word / Mind Manager)<br>- Projects (One Note / Mind Manager)<br>- Tasks (a real mish-mash of ways that has to be cleaned up)<br>- Schedule (3x5 card in my AF book)<br>- Appointments (another mish-mash of chaos ;-)<br><br>Well, you get the idea.  By going through first the PURPOSE and then my current IMPLEMENTATION, I saw where things had gone terribly wrong ;-)  Now I'm almost in a position to simplify.  If I use more than one system (like backing up my AF book to Excel to monitor statistics) it will be clear which is the system component and which is just a nice to have add on.<br><br>I don't know if that helps at all, but it is what worked for me.<br></div>

My understanding is that it CLAIMS to be a TO DO list but then the grass catcher aspect kind of stowed away somehow in the statement "it will take anything you throw at it".  That also managed to bootleg in the idea of projects on the list, and as you note, the dismissal rule made it also the repository of the someday/maybe list.<br><br>Now that is WAY to much for any single tool to handle and me still maintain my sanity ;-)<br><br>>>>  The someday list, on the other hand sits alongside it quite naturally, It hadn't occurred to me before that someday and maybe are different.  <<<<br><br>Yes, they are.  I think that David Allen merged the notions because when we are not focused on a time frame for execution then we might as well leave it open to not being done at all.  Makes sense to me.  But I can see why you say that dismissal really only identifies "maybe".<br><br>>>>  And other reference lists would also sit alongside it, such as contacts, shared issue logs and shared project task lists.  <<<<br><br>Yes, that is right.  Those are different parts of the whole system of which AF is also only a part.<br><br>>>> And the schedule/ calendar/ diary. <<<<br><br>Yep, more parts.</div>

<div class="content">Mike<br><br>I'd never argue against the results of your real experiences as to what does/doesn't work for you, but part of an earlier post of yours sparked a thought. You said:<br><br>>>> "The idea behind a grass catcher is that it is temporary. IOW, things just live there until you move them somewhere else: ... ... ... So you would not so much restrict it as to continually purge it." <<<<br><br>If you're using a grass catcher list alongside an AF (or alternate) to-do list, doesn't that mean you have two lists to regularly review, and two lists to which a new thought might be added? That seems to have some potential redundancy.<br><br>Have you tried using the AF2 list with a slightly different mindset/approach to items that're "someday/maybe" or similar? What I mean is, that as you move through the list if an item makes you think something a bit like "huh, that's not gonna happen anytime soon!" then treat that as 'standing out', and action it by moving it to the relevant side list - e.g. to a S/M list if maintained separately, or perhaps dismissed "early", or onto a "ideas for things I might want to buy" list, etc - or just cancel it completely if it's no longer relevant at all (I use a slightly different cross-out style to indicate I did nothing with it).<br><br>The item is then "completed", so apart from the physical line (if using paper) it's no longer cluttering up the AF list - and with no more time taken on it than if it was entered and reviewed in a separate grass-catcher list - but the regular review and entry of items is focused in one place rather than two.<br><br>I don't have the same kinds of issues as you with my AF2 list (at least so far), but it's an approach I already use satisfactorily for dealing with other types of items that a pre-filter (if used) would put somewhere other than the main AF list.<br><br>As I say, just a thought...<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike<br><br>thank you for that - that is really helpful.  Whilst we put different things into our "lists/repositories/whatever" the overall premise is the same.  With AF1 I had no problem with throwing everything at it to start with.  I then found it encouraged me to streamline my project management system (OneNote) which I did BUT never completed.  That is where my first disconnect comes in.<br><br>With AF2 I find I am naturally more selective about what is achievable but realise that that is perhaps running the risk of becoming too work vs play oriented.  What I did do though with AF was to analyse my dismissed items under AF1.  Of course in OneNote it is very easy to tag them so that i can see at a glance what I need to.  I didn't want to continually wade through loads of items for my "review dismissed items" task when I knew some were gone for good or had been subsequently actioned, but neither did I want to "corrupt" my paper notebook with the addition of additional markers or highlight. I now have 4 dismissed categories in ON (actioned subsequently, gone for good, to review and someday/maybe). I now have a relatively small list to review each time. <br><br>What I now need to do is get back to the "throw everything at the list" mentality on the basis that my OneNote dismissal tags will give sufficient structure to review, and get my project management working well.<br><br>My biggest issue long term is "how" to file stuff.  I want a compact system but one that I can archive regularly.  I am forever trying to find the perfect system - you know the type of "do I file Car Insurance under ABC Insurance Co, Motor Insurance, Vehicle XYZ, or 2009" questions.  The trouble is there is no right or wrong answer but there is a massive difference, in that annual filing is a lot easier to archive but what about the files that you want to span multiple years?  Oh well - more thinking time to add to my list ..... :-)<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine,<br><br>Yeah, different strokes ;-)<br><br>I'm committed to paper at the moment.  I wish that electronic made sense, but it only does as an add-on to paper.  In my world, anyway.  That said, electronic does work well for reference material.  For example, I can have thousands of files (OY!) on an 8 or 16 GB card in a phone or Palm.  But for a recording device I prefer paper.<br><br>As to throwing everything at it, I think I now know how to do that ... at least my work today seems to indicate so.  I cleaned up my list and am ready to run it on my new "system".  Let's see how it goes.<br><br>As to corrupting the notebook... I confess that I had to do that with this new approach.  I REALLY hate it but it beats the alternarive ... keeping multiple books.  (Just imagine flipping open different books and trying to decide where to write which thing based on what criterion.  Insanity.)  I was able to find a way to simplify a complex system just a bit.  I ended up adding only three new tags (as I remember ... I'm a bit punchy now ;-)  And those tags are just to help with the processing which I have changed.<br><br>I've added a new dismissal rule and modified the others just slightly.  The result is (hopefully) to get and keep all items that are not actionable off of the list and somewhere that they will live happily until their time has come.  In my first pass ... a clean up pass ... I was able to close only three pages ... but most other pages have only a few open left on them.  IIRC, I got rid of about 150 items and now have a list that should dramatically reduce from 30 open pages to maybe 10 or so.  I expect that most of whatever reduction I get I will get in about a week or so.  As I say, time will tell.<br><br>I wish I did not have to add those tags, but they are short lived.</div>

<div class="content">Christine, I LOVE my current filing system. And this is from a woman who has tried it all. ;-) I use large colored Pendaflex plastic hanging file folders with sides. The color represents a major category. For example, green is for all my records (warranties, receipts for major items that fall under warranty, even professional records). I have these file folders in a portable file box. They stay open in the box so when I am sorting mail, all I have to do is pop them into the major category file. No more deciding what file, no more file labeling. As they get full, they are put into file drawers dedicated to that category. They are filed in order from most recent to oldest making this very much like the lever file system only with NO punching papers. If I need a receipt for something I bought recently, I just go to the records file that is currently being filled. If older, then to the next older file. Is there some digging involved? Yup, but I'm willing to bet $ that I spend less time digging than I would spend filing in detail. The truth is I WASN'T filing in a precise manner anyway because I hated it!! How much better to have things sorted by category and generally by date than not to have them sorted at all. :-) The other great thing about this approach is you can file in front of the TV even! Just take your papers and your file box and you'll be done in minutes. ;-)<br><br></div>

Other time on the journey will be spent reading a book (light, non-work), having a glass or two of red wine (not too much!), and then trying to get some sleep.

<div class="content">Mel - I'd be interested in knowing what your other major categories for filing are.<br><br>This year, I've taken a similar approach to my financial files.  I used to have about 12-15 separate folders for different bank accounts, different bills, and so on.  But this year, I have only 2-3 specific folders, and then one catch-all folder for everything else.  It does make it FAR simpler, but so far it doesn't seem any less effective.  I may drop down to two folders next year -- one for tax-related, one for everything else.</div>

Also, many people choose to ignore any explicit examination of their values ... that is fine, but values still operate to help us govern choices and if we don't know what they are explicitly, then we are simply operating in the dark.<br></div>

<div class="content">Seraphim, unfortunately, I don't think my folder system will be very applicable to you or others. I don't file tax stuff; my dh does. Those papers are put immediately into his inbox. If I DID file them, however, I would have a separate folder for them. The advantage is I think it's possible that everything from a given tax year would fit in one folder. Unless you own a huge company. ;-)<br><br>I have a home office that is separate from my house. I keep everything pertaining to projects I work on there (writing, scrapbooking church) in that file, only because I can then take it to the office in one trip. One of my AF tasks is then to sort those further, but very generally. There is no urgency in doing so, however, because as I will explain there is nothing there that requires action in the near future.<br><br>I have a folder for social/recreation/information. Examples of items that go here are trip ideas and greeting cards I've purchased for later use. I have this folder based on my old filing system. Because of keeping so many more digital files (and ordering greeting cards online), I expect to eliminate this category soon.<br><br>I have a folder for everything homeschool related. The only files that I break down further eventually are those I keep for each child by year for record-keeping purposes. Otherwise,  I am strictly using the basic approach of most recently filed in front. This folder is what you could apply to any major project, endeavor, or work you do specifically.<br><br>Finally, I have a folder (besides the records one I discussed in a previous post) that is for actionable items. I list these on my AF2 list or if they're not important enough to list separately, I may just put "Work Action Folder" on my AF2 list. If I come to, "Return car iPod connector" on my AF2 list, I know that the receipt I need to contact customer service is in my yellow folder. <br><br>As I'm sorting, I do have some small folders that do not fit in my portable file box for things like coupons, recipes, and things I'm waiting on. If I'm working on a major project, I sometimes keep a separate file for it, too. These files are kept in a very large file box along with the 1-31 and Monthly File Folders that I rarely use. I plan to add a file to my portable file box for FUTURE. For example, if I have a doctor's appt. in a month and have to bring a completed form, that form would go in the Future file. I would then add a reminder on appt. day to retrieve the form from the Future file and I'm good to go.  No need to file in a specific dated file. I believe this will be ideal for my purposes. I will still have a coupon bin/file, waiting on bin/file, and a project file as the occasion arises. I plan to convert to digital recipes so that I am not overloaded with paper ones I rarely use.<br><br>I hope this helps you think about how to condense your system for your purposes. I think as complex as absolutely necessary and no more is best!</div>

<div class="content">It probably pays to take the contrarian approach for a moment ... and I'm just the one to do it.<br><br>I used the "pile" system at work for years.  In that context it worked beautifully.  I think that was so because 99.9% of things that hit my inbox were complete crap that I would NEVER do anything about or want to find again.  IOW, the real  cost of filing was very high compared to the potential cost of retrieval.<br><br>In my personal life, somewhat the opposite is true.  I have the luxury of trashing all junk without a thought of who I might offend.  (In fact, my paper recycle bin is on the way back from my mail box to the house door and most things never make it into the house at all ;-)  So in this case, almost everything I get is potentially something I'll want to retrieve, IOW, the cost of filing is small compared to the probable cost of retrieval.  IOW, if I need something I need it now, and not a week from now after hours upon hours of digging.<br><br>With respect to taxes, one reason people have so much trouble is that they don't "file as they go".  IOW, it is costly to put everything you think might be important to tax filing into a big file and wait until April to dig thorough it all and start sorting.  At the moment an item is received it is most clear what the tax effect will most likely be and so it can be filed precisely where it will be needed.  (Example: you buy Ibuprofen at the grocery.  THAT is the time to circle the Ibuprofen and break out the cost and mark it "medical" and put it in the "TAX:Medical" file ... not when tax time arrives and you have no idea why you kept that receipt and have to read and decode every item on it ... and hundreds of others like it.)  Quicken is brilliant for this in that one can code an item with the exact IRS form line it will go.  A religious user of quicken can press a button or two and have his taxes printed off the day the last W-2 arrives.<br><br>I have, over the past few years, begun to move toward paperless.  This makes a big dent in filing because it does not have to be done at all ... except to organize computer files a bit.  Many banks and other organizations no longer want to handle paper and so are making it easy to get things electronically: eBills, Statements, etc.  Every time I order something on line I print the invoice to a PDF file rather than paper.  Then I save it into folders like: Invoices, Statements, etc.  When the box arrives I need only walk the invoice to my computer, pull up the file and compare.  (Well, I still have to physically check the items in the box.  ;-)<br><br>For things where I still get paper, I got myself one of those slick little ScanSnap machines -- it is so small it sits on my desk top and new paper gets gobbled up as it comes out of the envelope.  The only change I wish they'd make is to have the paper exit the back so it could fall straight into the trash can ;-)<br><br>For receipts I have a Neat Receipts portable scanner that handles store receipts quite nicely.  Its software has tax categories and I can easily search and total on those.  It is quite handy for reimbursement from the FHS plan.  Just a click and I have a years worth of medical costs printed out to submit.  If I need the hard copy of a particular item to answer a question, I can print the image and either email it, FAX it, or snail mail it to the plan administrator.<br><br>To join in on the fun go here: <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/paperlesszone/" rel="nofollow">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/paperlesszone/</a><br><br>That is the home for those of us who are making a religion out of banishing ALL paper ;-)  Well, I guess I'll never get rid of SOME of my better books ;-) ;-)</div>

I used to use a colour coded suspension file system and that worked well but I now only have cupboard filing rather than filing drawers.  I have been using a numeric filing system which has worked well but still feel I have too many files.  Accounts filing is not such a problem.  Like Mike I scan as much as possible and accounts filing by year is pretty straightforward.  It's the odd stuff that gets me ...........<br><br>Reminds me of my first PA who filed everything I threw at her and was instantly able to retrieve wharever I needed.  Fantastic!  Until the day the fax machine died and she was not in.  We had been reviewing new fax machines for a while (this was in the days when they cost megabucks!) so I though "no problem" ....... I looked in a file labelled office equipment - no joy - I looked under Xerox - nothing - I looked under everything that seemed logical to me until finally I called her......... "Oh, it's filed under "P" " she said gaily.  "P?" I asked ..... "Yes, P - for plain paper fax!"</div>

<div class="content">The trouble with alphabetic systems is that they are totally reliant on everyone using the system having the same understanding of how something is filed, and even if you are the only person using it you have to remember your thought processes at the time of filing (A for Auto etc).  I love colour coded systems like TABS as used in hospitals etc but probably overkill for a home filing system.  Now if you could get the software to print your own TABS style labels without needing to win the lottery ..........</div>

<div class="content">Christine,<br><br>You can gin up a numeric system fairly easily.  Something Like:<br><br>1.

The advantage is that the most used files are together.  If you are doing taxes, you are going to be interested in your Work Files (W2s), Bank and Investments and Credit Cards ... all of that is going to be in the "2" section.<br><br>Moreover, it is trivially simple to make a computer index (Excel is good enough) and print a copy to tape on the file cabinet.  Sort it two ways:<br>- By numeric<br>- By Name<br><br>The by name list will give you.<br><br>Company A - 2.1.4<br>Company B - 3.2.5<br>Company C - 2.1.3<br>etc.<br><br>So you can quickly see what folder an item is filed in or what is in a folder ... without touching the folder.  It is so much faster to scan a list looking for something than digging through folders!  Once running, it is pretty low maintenance and the chance of misfiling is small.  After all, you have to think about WHAT a document is about and then make the decision, file it, and then document where it is.  Putting it back is also easy ... you have the  number on the document, on the manila folder, on the hanging file, and on the list!  You'd have to try hard to screw that up ;-)  There is no guessing about what you called it because the numbers don't have much meaning beyond the first digit and you already know that the Auto Insurance is going to be in "3", for example, with all of the other insurance stuff, whereas the other Car stuff will be in "6", for example, because that is where you keep your maintenance records, titles, etc.<br><br>The big advantage is that another person can walk in the door and find your Auto Insurance policy in a jiffy.  If he does not know the name of the company, he can look at the sections and see there is one which had all kinds of insurance documents and it has to be one of those companies ... all he has to do is pull those three or four folders to see which is home and which is auto and which is goldfish insurance ;-)<br><br>Another advantage -- if you had an emergency you'd know which files to grab and run.  Your crucial personal data is all in the first file or two.  If there was an accident you would not have to search for medical records ... grab folders in that section and run out the door to the hospital.  Just a few pluses to structure things logically.  (Oh, and if you do scanning, you can keep the same structure for your directories of digital copies of things.)<br><br>I don't know about TABS, but your printer can print labels and they sell colored tag holders for those labels.  But then why bother ... coding all Financial in Green is redundant if you know that all Financial folders are in the "2" series.  But what the hey, color is always nice ;-)  To make life easy for myself, I indent the label on the hanging file for each level.  I also use those Fifth-Cut manila folders to match.  Once in a while, I can find colored ones that are fun.<br><br>But then you could go really hog wild and get one of those electro-mechanical rotating file cabinets to hold THOUSANDS of folders ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>I think I mentioned elsewhere, in another context (IBM) I used the "pile" system of filing ... probably much like yours, and it worked like a dream as well.  However, I almost never needed to fish out old stuff.  Now that I throw out things I used to feel I had to file to cover my ass but knew I would never need, the likelihood of needing to fish things out is high enough that the cost to retrieve is too high with that system, as compared to the cost to file in a more traditional way.  Thus the elaborate system.  I REALLY don't want to spend more than a minute to lay my hands on a document.  But then, that is just how my values shake out ;-)<br><br>In the right environment, the "pile" system is the cat's meow ;-)  When I retired there were loads of boxes that just went into the trash, unopened ... I no longer needed to cover my ass.  ;-)  I can't imagine how many hours I spent NOT filing anything ... except the absolute essentials.<br><br>As I was dumping the boxes, I just imagined how many lunch announcements, charity drive notices, memos to everyone in the company ... etc. that were in those boxes.  What incredible waste.  But then so are the over six credit card solicitations from Capital One I get every week ... which I will never respond to.  (I'd love to see the cost/benefit analysis on those!)<br><br>So yeah, different strokes for different folks and situations.  ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Mike:<br><br>Retrieval is much faster with my system than the "traditional way". I would be extremely frustrated if I took as long as a minute to find *any* file.<br><br>All I have to do is read along the file titles on the shelf from left to right. Since the most frequently used will tend to be on the left, I will come to them very quickly. So in 90% of cases retrieval is almost instant. To read along the whole shelf takes a little bit longer (perhaps 30 seconds) but only very rarely do I have to read right to the end.<br><br>The only problem with this filing system (as I mention in the book) is that it can't really be shared with anyone else.</div>

<div class="content">One key criterion is whether anyone else will be using your filing system much. If it's just you, then a few touches of whimsy may well help. And if you need to check two or three folders once in a blue moon that is a small price to pay for having everything in the system.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike<br><br>Thanks for your amazingly detailed post.  One of the best TM systems I used back in the 1980's was A Time (now TMI International I believe) and they used a project referencing system in a similar way (i, i.i, i.iv.iii, etc) which made things very easy to follow.  My numeric system is based on the Pile Cabinet method and works well but I always hanker after alphabetic systems for some reason.<br><br>I have added a task to comprehensively review my system so your post will form part of my review!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark<br><br>Your post sent me scurrying off to my copy of DIT!  I will also be adding your advice to my "review" :-)  Suspect "my" final system will fall somewhere in between!</div>

<div class="content">I've been using Mark's system for files on any current / active projects.  I have a shelf where all those folders go, and it's REALLY easy to find them (2 seconds in most cases).<br><br>If things start piling up, and there's no more space on the shelf, I start from the oldest files, and move the inactive ones into a filing cabinet, where they are in one A-to-Z alphabetized system.  There's usually only 2-3 possibilities, so even with these older things, it takes only about 30 seconds to find something (max).  <br><br>This whole thing works pretty well, but I think it would work even better if I didn't break down projects and reference folders as much as I have.  The granularity is pretty small, and doesn't need to be.  <br><br>For example, I have a folder for my mobile phone company that has statements going back 5 years.  What's the point?  It'd probably be better to just have one folder for all bills, and throw everything in there for the year, then file it away at the end of the year.  <br><br>If I was having problems with the mobile phone company, and needed all my statements in one place, it'd take about 10 minutes to go through all those annual folders and find all the old statements.  I could then throw them into a project folder, put it on the shelf, and that way it'd be easy to find while I'm working out the problems.<br><br>That's why I was interested in Mel's filing methods -- sounded like she had this kind of thing all worked out.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim, we seem to have similar takes on TM. Remind me, do you use paper or digital? Also, are you using and liking the new combo approach?</div>

<div class="content">Mel -- I've been using paper exclusively.  Recently I tried to supplement that with a separate AF2 list in Google Tasks, to deal with my Gmail emails that need action.  I had a "Google Tasks" entry in my main AF list.  It saved the (very minor) hassle of writing down the task in my AF book, but besides that it didn't really work that well.  Probably because the actually tasks weren't present in the AF list, and didn't get the benefit of constant exposure, little and often, and all that.   <br><br>I am online all the time at work, and often at home, but also do quite a bit off-line.  I've never been able to justify the expense of an iPhone or PDA of any kind -- I used to carry around a tiny pocket-sized notebook and joked with my friends that it was my "poor man's PDA".  (Though I must admit, Google Tasks made me take a long, hard look at getting an iPod Touch...)   :-)<br><br>Anyway, the paper approach just works great for me.  And with paper it's so simple to add a doodle or a note on the side -- much harder to do in an electronic format.   I use the right-side pages for AF, and the left-side pages for notes of all kinds.  Meeting notes, explanatory details on AF tasks, business cards and medical prescriptions can be taped or stapled there, etc.  <br><br>Plus it's much easier to go over it with my wife, rather than poking through a PDA or bringing my laptop to the kitchen table so we can talk and make plans.  She has no patience for the overhead of electronic gizmos.  :-)   "Oops, sorry about, I can't get the laptop to wake up, I'll have to restart, can you come back in 10 minutes?"   Grrrr<br><br>The new combo approach looks great!  It's very similar to the dual-mode approach I was trying, but I was struggling with some aspects of that.  It just seemed to bog down sometimes, especially in AF2 mode.  When in AF2 mode, I ended up doing an "informal" AF2 approach -- scanning over the last few pages to see if there's anything urgent, acting on them, and then switching back to AF1 (with AF1 dismissal) once the feeling of urgency had passed.  Interesting, just like Mark recommends with the new method, I would always start the day with AF2, and once I was comfortable that everything was in order, the AF1 task would "stand out", and I'd switch back to that for most of the day, unless something urgent came up.<br><br>That actually was working pretty well.  But I think Mark has taken it to another level, worked out all the kinks, and made it into one whole consistent system again.  He is truly amazing.  I am looking forward to giving it a try -- planning to do that today!</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim, thank you so much for your thorough response. It helps me to think through the best approach for me. I just completed day 2 with paper and am surprised that I don't totally hate it. I created a Google Tasks list called ADD TO AF NOTEBOOK. That helps me when I can't find my notebook. One curious thing that I am finding with paper is that I somehow feel I am accomplishing more, though I doubt I am. I was constantly deleting tasks from my Google Tasks list to keep the list manageable. Now I see all the completed tasks lined out, giving me the impression that I'm really busy. LOL<br><br>I was really LOLing about you using tech to talk with your wife. My dh's eyes start rolling back in his head when I do that. :-) I, too, have been using Google Tasks to separate email tasks and then have a EMAIL TASKS entry in my notebook. Your point is well taken about not seeing important tasks on your list this way. I think the tasks that really need attention I will add to my notebook rather than Google tasks. <br><br>One final issue I will need to deal with is my return to adding everything to the list with no associated lists. On the one hand I am thinking I will get more done this way. On the other, I think there's a serious threat of overwhelm. If I find the latter, I may continue to test paper but keeping my associated lists.</div>
