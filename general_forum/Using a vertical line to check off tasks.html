<div class="content">I've been using this technique for years now, and I don't know if I thought it up or if I got it from someone (probably Mark!), but others have tried it and remarked how well it worked for them too. <br><br>The idea is that instead of just crossing off items with a horizontal line, or using a checkmark, you draw a vertical line to the left of the item where you would normally put a checkmark. After you have a number of things checked off, the vertical lines connect, and the gaps make it really easy to see which items are not done. <br><br>It looks like this (the dashed lines indicate a strike through):<br><br>|   ---Task 1---<br>|   ---Task 2---<br>    Task 3<br>|   ---Task 4---<br>|   ---Task 5---<br>    Task 6<br>|   ---Task 7---<br><br>Hope you find this helpful!</div>

<div class="content">Rats. The leading spaces were removed. Here's another attempt at a visual. Ignore the dots. <br><br>.     |   ---Task 1---<br>.     |   ---Task 2---<br>.             Task 3<br>.     |   ---Task 4---<br>.     |   ---Task 5---<br>.             Task 6<br>.     |   ---Task 7---</div>

<div class="content">I found this old thread about it (2009): <a href="../general_forum/Vertical line prompts action!.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/657001</a><br><br>Sarah W brought it up as a suggestion to draw the vertical line through tick marks, and Jane P mentioned that she crossed items out horizontally and then connects the horizontal lines with vertical lines.<br><br>Mark Forster wrote (Feb 8, 2009): "Thanks for the tip. The vertical line makes the number of tasks remaining much clearer - and makes a very pretty pattern if one crosses out like I and Jane do!"<br><br>(Sarah W also mentioned at the end that she also crosses them out horizontally.)<br><br>I don't think that's the thread I got it from though. I think it must have been from Mark demonstrating it at some point.  Here's a blog article for AF2 which shows the technique being used: <a href="../blog/Autofocus 2 Sample Page.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2009/7/23/autofocus-2-sample-page.html</a><br><br>"Contiguous deleted items are joined with a vertical line. This makes it very quick to identify where unactioned tasks are located on the page"<br><br>I do it compulsively now; it's just so useful for the reasons already stated.</div>

<div class="content">Ha! I now recall seeing that image of Mark's notebook page, but not the 2009 thread. Thanks for digging it up! Figures I got the idea because of Mark. So many "productivity experts" out there, but in my opinion no one else develops or assembles a more consistently useful body of techniques that actually work.  :)</div>

<div class="content">In particular, with No List FVP, I draw a vertical line when I start something, cross it when done, and don't cross it when just setting it aside.  Then the things that remain to be finished are clearly visible and if I want pick it up again, I cross and rewrite.</div>
