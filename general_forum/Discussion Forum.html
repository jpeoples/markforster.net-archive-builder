<div class="content">I've studiously avoided making metaposts these last few weeks. But, I can restrain myself no longer. Is this forum great, or what?</div>

<div class="content">Oh the vicissitudes of online BBSs, newgroups, forums, etc. When the hysterical members threaten to leave, lurkers who pipe to criticize, you just have to wait.<br><br>Been at this game since 1987. Nothing changes. <br><br>Forum, newsgroups, and boards that stay on-topic (unless it is about quantum-cryptology for example) all the time die out and become populated by the spam bots and the occasional post by a nostalgic once member.<br><br>Heraclitus contra Homer as related by Aristotle:<br><br>'would that strife might perish from among gods and men’ (Iliad) for there would not be harmony without high and low notes, nor living things without female and male, which are opposites.</div>

<div class="content">Moises asked "Is this forum great, or what?"<br><br>As for me, discussions about time management provide very pleasant distractions from working, and from managing my perceptions, thoughts, feelings, actions, etc.<br><br>So, yes, this forum is great.</div>

<div class="content">Norman,<br><br>what do you prefer, the Iliad or the Odyssey?<br><br>My favourite is the Odyssey, because of Ulysses' cunning intelligence, while I found the Iliad somewhat boring with all that heroism, manslaughters, and massacres.</div>

<div class="content">I agree and Homer is a good reference, how much you invested and lost and killed in a war, in the end we remember the song of some blind noob, not the strife. And why not, I prefer a good song over a war.</div>

<div class="content">Ranier,<br><br>If you are being serious. I love the ridiculously extended metaphors and similes that "Homer" just gets lost in at times in the _Iliad_. But since it is thoroughly from an oral tradition there is much tedious repetition to the eyes of a contemporary reader. (This is remedied easily with some intelligent editing of the text.)<br><br>Also, the text stands as an incredible rebuke of war and a song of sympathy for the "barbarian". Hector, probably the only sympathetic character (maybe Priam as well), has quite a touching moment with his wife before his death, the celebration of which (complete with homerian epithet) ends most contemporary translations.   <br><br>"And so they buried Hector, tamer of horses."<br><br>A beautifully and surprisingly stark and silent ending to such an overwrought tale. Within the context of this line must the entire work be read, or (un)fortunately re-read.<br><br>_The Odyssey_ is more accessible to us. And who doesn't love Odysseus? <br><br>As a "story" _The Odyssey_ is more successful for contemporary times, but my copies of the _Iliad_ are much more worn. Its lyric is wonderfully beautiful, baffling, flawed, and dense. It also resists interpretation to a greater degree than the _Odyssey_. <br><br>Also if you care for other things Greek, the _Iliad_ is simply the shadow in which all else written. <br><br>If I could only own a copy of one, it would be the _Iliad_.<br><br>Been a long time since I studied either diligently, so take this with a mine of salt.</div>
