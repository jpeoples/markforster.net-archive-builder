<div class="content">As a twist on AF I am writing a list of things I'm avoiding, with a reason next to them - then I proceed in AF mode. This makes explicit my comfort zone and my procrastination zone.</div>

<div class="content">Interesting. Could you clarify whether you are using AF mode on the avoidance list only - or are you combining the avoidance list with the "comfort zone list"?<br><br>Coincidentally I'm working with a new method myself of getting the tasks I am avoiding done - and I'll be writing a blog post about it - just as soon as I stop avoiding doing it!</div>

<div class="content">Mark: I separate the lists. I also sometimes add an FV-list or a SF-list - it depends on the "mode" in which I wish to approach certain activities. I'm experimenting with a page of all 4 modes on 1 page (AF, SF, FV and the avoidance list), putting items where I feel they need to be.<br><br>The meta-model you have is really different mentailities or modes of approaching what could be done. My aim is to support myself in becoming more aware or conscious of what type of thing in me is pulling me down to habits, fears or limitations of various sorts. Just pausing to recognise where my free-will is hijacked by me ego's wish to avoid risk or anything that could be seen as threatening or a loss of some kind.</div>

<div class="content">Hi all<br><br>I may be a bit unique (but I don't think so) but I know that much of my resistance is genetically based. Boredom is actually painful. It's like the mental equivalent of sticking my hand in fire.  What affects it most is my prediction based on experience.  If I remember something to be boring, my initial response is to recoil.  My powers of prediction are flawed because of this.  If I feel resistance to what I think is boredom, then I'll just start.  I plan the size of the start (first task of job or first step of the first task of the job) according to the anxiety level I experience when I think about it.  Then I'll alternate with a lower anxiety task.  This acts as a respite.  The beauty part is that my initial evaluation isn't always accurate about the entire job. I just keep starting until one or two things happen: Either I get engaged in the work or the starts add up to completion for the day.  For jobs that I'm afraid to start because I don't know what I'm going to do (creativity) or what the job entails (a learning curve or problem solving), I feel the same resistance.  For this type of challenge, I resolve in my mind that I can't predict how long it will take and just see where it takes me.<br><br><br>Reading this may seem like it's not very difficult. It's been like this since grade school.  The best that I can do is make sure that I've chosen my MITs and worthy alternate tasks well.<br><br><br><br><br>If the job requires physical or cognitive stamina that I don't have, I'll only start it early despite the pain if I really need the extra time (just in case the pain gets worse later.  I can't count on it abating.  I just have to do the best I can with generous breaks with easier work.  This requires even better judgement choosing my work.  I just can't count on my body or brain getting better in enough time to meet deadline or routine rotations.  If the routine rotations can wait without much fallout, I'll stop after my MITs are done.<br><br><br>I envy people who can manipulate their resistance.  The best that I can do is cope with it as effectively as possible.  That's why I always choose MITs.  In case I peter out for whatever reason, the most important work is current no matter what. (excepting things truly outside my control.  I had surgery on Friday so I did as much as possible beforehand so I don't get too far behind.)  We can't control everything but with effort we can do better than we give ourselves credit for.  <br><br><br>Bottom line: My resistance is genetic and based on actual damage. I've gotten good at getting my work done despite, but it's never gotten any easier.  The bright side is the gratitude I feel when I have a job that has little or no resistance.  It feels like an oasis in the desert.<br><br><br>I hope for your sake that your resistance isn't permanent. Chris's wasn't permanent.  I wish the same for all of you. I hope you are the lucky people who fine a magic bullet or a process that ease the burden.  OTOH, if you can't help it, don't be so hard on yourself.  I've been pushing through resistance for many, many decades. It doesn't have to interfere with your success.<br><br>My advice: If you have to labor through resistance, make sure you're doing the right work.</div>

<div class="content">p.s. When in need, use gamification to get get your MITs done, not to avoid them.  Mark Forster stated it well.  Don't turn normal work into black clouds.<br><br>Hint: I tend to low ball my predictions when I feel resistance.  If I keep the challenge doable, that gives me more confidence in my abilities.  Don't overwhelm yourself if possible.</div>

<div class="content">learning:<br><br>"If you have to labor through resistance, make sure you're doing the right work."<br><br>And how to make sure you're doing the right work? I'll give the answer in the style of Johnnie Cochran: <br><br>If you resist, you must insist.<br><br>Alternatives:<br>If the brain resist, you must insist.<br>If you resist it, you must insist it.<br>Resist? Insist.<br><br>Or: <br>If you have to labor through resistance, you're making sure you're doing the right work.</div>

<div class="content">I like the idea of explicitly stating why we're resisting something. I haven't tried it formally, but my most productive days often include realizing that I don't have a good reason for avoiding many tasks. Likewise, it's easier to stop fretting about a task if I realize there's a good reason I haven't done it.<br><br>One common reason for me avoiding things is not knowing which to do do first. If only they'd stop saying, "No, don't do that one. Do me!" I'd pick one and do it. Instead, though, I drown them out by doing something unimportant. If I can recognize it when it happens, often I can pick one -- any one -- and actually do it.<br><br>Learning, I hope the surgery and recovery goes well!</div>

<div class="content">The longer the list the more probable it’s that there are hanging some high resistance tasks that should have been done a long time ago. In my case the long list is the reason for  using a specific list to highlight those tasks.<br><br>When I plan the next week I make a sublist ”Don’t want to see next week” and pick those items from the long list which I don’t want for various reasons to see in the list next week. Usually they are tasks I resist. I write the list to the top left corner of a my weekly plan. <br><br>When I take the plan on Monday morning something curious happens. My mind seems to think that if I dont’ want to see those tasks next week so I don’t want to see them tomorrow either. So I begin to do those tasks with some kind of acceptance that  it’s time to do them now.  And there is a pattern how they get done.<br><br>There are no bigger problems with the easiest ones. The dentist is called.<br><br>The more difficult ones may require working with somebody else or bribing myself with a reward ’Do first Unpleasant and then Pleasant’<br><br>The tasks requiring more time to do benefit from SMEMA approach ’Unpleasant ’ / ’Else 1’ / ’Unpleasant (2)’ // ’Else 2’ / Unpleasant (3)’ //  ’Else 3’ / ’Unpleasant (4’) // etc.   In SMEMA approach I especially like that after the first 2 tasks are done, it’s time to choose what ’Else’ to do between the next Unpleasants. What I choose to do depends on my mood and energy level.<br><br>Else 1,2,3,… may be another task, a cup of tea, a meeting, walking around 5 minutes, speaking with a colleague, playing a computer game or whatever keeps me going so that Unpleasant task gets done.<br><br>(By the way, the mystery number in the parenthesis in the task chain is the number how many times I have touched the task. I use it in all tasks which I’m going to continue so that they don’t get lost in a long list.)<br><br>When I tested this approach the most difficult thing was to find a right name for the list. "Dont't want to see next week" is pretty stupid but it triggers an automatic reaction in my head: Just get rid of those. So if you test this approach try it with different list names.</div>

<div class="content">In my experience the most effective way of dealing with high-resistance items is "start small and keep at it".<br><br>So ideally you should keep re-visiting a high-resistance task several times a day until it is completed. It doesn't really matter how long you work on it at each visit, just so long as you keep coming back to it.<br><br>In the gaps you can do a range of easier tasks so that you get a good rest from the difficult stuff.<br><br>Having written the above, I must see if I can write a system which will achieve it in the best possible way. I need a method which will isolate the high-resistance tasks, hit them hard but also allow easier tasks to get done.<br><br>I think a simple modification to AF4 might achieve this.</div>

<div class="content">Coincidentally I've been doing something similar this morning but using smema and timed bursts (GED). My first 3 tasks this morning were:-<br><br>Project xyz 5 min<br>Kettle on & tea<br>Project xyz 6 min<br><br>Everytime I needed to add 2 tasks one was automatically Project xyz. Settled on 10 minutes as the max time on each task.<br><br>Got loads done as well as real progress on the project I'd been resisting. In fact I'm quite eager to get back to it!</div>

<div class="content">I've progressed on my idea in my previous post, and am wondering if I haven't actually succeeded in producing the ultimate system. I won't claim that yet though - not until I've tried it out for a bit.<br><br>It brings together all the things which I've been trying to achieve over the years:<br><br>Universal capture<br>Really hits the high resistance tasks<br>Can cope with even the most urgent tasks<br>Doesn't involve compulsion at any stage<br>Is psychologically satisfying<br><br>I'm very excited about it.</div>

<div class="content">Mark: "Having written the above, I must see if I can write a system which will achieve it in the best possible way. I need a method which will isolate the high-resistance tasks, hit them hard but also allow easier tasks to get done."<br><br>How about something like this?  A new modification called Intervention.<br><br>1.  Capture all your tasks in the usual way and work them as per your favourite system (AF, FV, AF4R, etc)<br><br>2.  Notice when certain tasks are hanging around longer than might feel comfortable.  These would be tasks that are likely to be untouched and hence dismissed if left for much longer.  Once such tasks are identified, mark them with an "H" for High resistance.<br><br>3.  Intervention!  This takes over from the system's normal workflow temporarily.  Take one of the H tasks and a number of tasks which stand out and are straightforward and circle them all.<br><br>4.  You now start working on the H task and are allowed to break it up with the smaller tasks.  But you cannot continue with the list until you have done the H task.  Use as many of the smaller tasks as needed but treat the H tasks and the smaller tasks as a temporary closed list.<br><br>5.  Once the H task is done, the remaining small tasks return to the system and normal rules processing resumes for the system.<br><br>This means you get to use your favourite system in normal use, but high-resistance tasks are periodically isolated and hammered away at, with other tasks being used to break them up so they get done also.</div>

<div class="content">Chris:<br><br>Interesting idea. In fact the AF4 modification which I'm working on at the moment does most of this automatically as part of the system (at least that's what I think it will do!). It first isolates the high resistance tasks and then hammers away at them, while allowing a certain amount of work on the rest of one's tasks.<br><br>If you're familiar with AF4 you can probably guess what the modification is that I've made to it. If not, I'll be describing it in a blog post before long - assuming it works of course.</div>

When I get a migraine, my coworkers will say things like, "You are working too hard"  or  "Your job is too stressful and that's why you get migraines".     I am always puzzled by this, because for me it's always the other way around - the migraines *create* the stress because they prevent me from getting anything done!</div>

<div class="content"><< re my eralier post on 4 modes to a page>><br><br>This didn't work. I had 4 lists being worked in different ways - too much confusion and overhead.<br><br>What worked better was to have the AF list (with no closed list or backlog) and then sometimes add some SF-list items or SF with 3 Tasks.<br><br>What also worked well was to mark the items I'm most resisting with an R (someone else suggested this on a post - I don't remember who) - another way of making explicit what I'm avoiding; it's seems to make it more conscious and aware where I'm resisting. I like that. The decision to stop pretending that I'm addressing these items by marking them as "Resisting" is like a mini-confessional. I accept I'm resisting them, and stop hiding from the fact - letting life show me what is true about me, taking me closer to what Buddhists might call right-action, the choiceless choice.<br><br>I also realised that it's not the fear of the first step of the resisting list that holds me back, it's my fear of what the 10th step MIGHT be. So my next consciousness-rasing amendment to the "avoidance list" is to gain clarity by re-writing an avoided activity as 3 easier activities.</div>

<div class="content">michael:<br><br>"...it's not the fear of the first step of the resisting list that holds me back, it's my fear of what the 10th step MIGHT be."<br><br><br>Very important distinction. <br><br>For a lot of people, many of these thoughts lie at the root of their resistance:<br><br>1. If I start this, it's going to take forever to finish.<br><br>2. Once I start this and get rolling, I may feel a compulsion to finish it. This will ensure everything else falls through the cracks.<br><br>3. If I start this, new things will continue rolling in.<br><br>4. I'll be constantly interrupted and I don't want to appear rude or lose potential opportunities by walling myself off. Also, I'm easily distracted.<br><br>5. If I do this I'll have even more tasks coming in because I've moved the project forward. I want a closed project, not a continually expanding one! I don't want more tasks and responsibilities!<br><br>6. If I do this, I know I'll have to feel super uncomfortable and may be rejected in a really unpleasant way which I'll obsess about for days, weeks, or years! I'll replay the conversation over and over again on my internal record player until it melts down into a pool of black magma.<br><br>7. This task is UTTERLY BORING and holds ZERO interest for me. I REFUSE to let me feel anything but mild anxiety about it. FEAR this task! Or ignore it! Barely touch it! It will make me feel uncomfortable anyhow. Do something less important. Something easy. That you're passionate about! Spin your wheels! (Not your conscious mind doing the talking, by the way).<br><br>8. What if, in the end, this task or project was a complete waste of time? How will I know NOW? BEFORE I begin? I won't start it until I know FOR SURE that the upside is huge and—GUARANTEED—and the downside is mild to non-existent and doing the task produces no feelings of being really uncomfortable.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Michael B.<br>That was an excellent list.  You can add my signature to all of them except #4 (I've always been accused of being antisocial when I was jamming with my work. Eh, whatever.)  and #6.  As an artist I needed to fail to learn and get better.  Most of my failures have been the path to success in many areas of living.  When I practiced gymnastics we had spotters and safety belts held by two people on each end because they expected us to fail, fail and fail again until we learned it and over-rehearsed until it was second nature.  Practicing music does the same thing!  LOL!  Those "failures" only feel like challenges because you know that you can learn.  Nowadays my  failures leads to just doing the damn thing again...no success. *blush*<br><br>#9  How long is it going to take me to learn it or figure out the solution?  How much of my time and money spent on supplies am I going to waste until I'm satisfied with the result?  LOL!<br>(In my case, will I even remember what I learned? LOL!)</div>

In fact doing the first step is the way to get moving on the project because the first step is easy if taken in isolation.

One could sum up the way to get any project done as "Keep beginning".

<div class="content">Hi Michael<br>LOL!  I used to be especially guilty of #2 before the wreck. Oddly, it never bothered me.  LOL!  As long as the house was straight, the animals cared for and the bills paid, I just didn't care!  I know it sounds kind of silly, but I lived for those rapturous flow times!  When I was lucky enough to experience that, I didn't care about much else.  When I was done, they'd make jokes like "Vickie has emerged from the Deep" or Vickie is out of her cave"  LOL!  ...and it wasn't just my art or other creative endeavors.Sometimes practicing anything or learning something took a lot of my attention. Even though others didn't like when it happened to me, I loved it. *blush*<br><br>I can relate to so many of the things you listed.  It almost looks like my personal profile.  I'm glad you understand how hard it is to get over the resistance hump.  People see me do certain work and they think I like it.  I hate it but I hate the anxiety of getting behind worse.....so that when an opportunity for #2 happens again, I can let go with full abandon.  LOL!</div>

<div class="content">Very useful list. I re-organized a live website for my needlecraft guild yesterday, after putting it off for ages.<br><br>Number 2 (eveything else will fall through the cracks) happens a lot for me. On first glance, it's a sign that the project should go into hibernation (my phrase for dismissed or someday/maybe), but I have a whole other group of things that others expect me to do in the next few weeks or months, so can't be hibernated.<br><br>Maybe "Why am I resisting?" is one of those spiraling questions. Once you clear up one answer (If I don't do it now when I'm on schedule with most things, I'll have to do it at the last minute, which will likely be when I'm behind on many things, and things will fall through the cracks.) another answer jumps up to be dealt with.<br><br>Like Learning, I love those flow times when I'm in them. I definitely go too deep for too long with reading and some creative projects. Less often with actual work.<br><br>This one surprised me because I thought I was good at dividing deep-focus projects into chunks with defined break points, but the fear still exists.<br><br>This one also works in reverse. If I'm afraid of something slipping through the cracks, I might work on it.<br><br>Number 4 (fear of locking self off). Oh, yes, but it's silly. I'm alone in the house most of the day! The same chunking that helps with number 2 helps here -- at least in theory.<br><br>Number 5 (moving the project forward creates more tasks) is also familiar. When I get into a project, the list of tasks gets longer -- not because the project is any bigger, but because I've identified individual tasks at increased resolution. That expansion makes it feel like an open list, but it's still a single project. I rarely feel Number 1, probably because I internalized the concept of closed and open-ended goals very early. (Closed = Done. Yay! E.g., wrote exam. Open = Always a work in progres, often maintenance, often with a hard bit when you get going, e.g., exercise program.)<br><br>Number 7 (boring) relates to an insight I saw an hour ago. More on that in another thread. So does Number 8 (what if I find it was a waste of time), and Number ?? (it's the 10th step that I fear).<br><br>Number 9 (not knowing the investment required) is also a big one. I fool myself into thinking I know, or will know before making the next decision, but when looking at my own things I'm as susceptible to the "sunk cost" fallacy as anyone.<br><br>Number 10 (unknown investment required) should stop me sooner than it does sometimes, and really holds me back for others. (That 10,000 hours to mastery theory. Eeps!)<br><br>This list is a lot longer and more insightful than I would have come up with. I generally stop with "Surely there's something more important / rewarding" and "all those reasons are silly or easy enough to counter".<br><br>Now relize my subconscious is applying any and all, especially Number 10, to that 10th step, and I can see why I'm stalling!<br><br>True reason for finally doing that website? I updated my weekly milestone / project chart. Now or September! Looking at the list: No, won't take forever to finish because I can redefine "finish" for this stage. "Good enough for the next six months." Fear of other things falling through the cracks? Possibly. This week and last I made a big push to catch up on routine things, so there's nothing to fall. I expected to spend a few hours, and could have paused safely several times (copy, paste, confirm, delete rather than cut and paste., but flow hit and it took about 8 with one break for supper. Also, that chart showed that this was likely to fall through the cracks if I didn't do it now! New things continue rolling in and expanding the project? I've got a good feel for the directions the site might expand in, and designed to allow that expansion. (The re-design was because I experimented with a blog-style site rather than a static site. Many people found it hard to find things, even with the search box. A successful experiment is one where you learn something.) Fear of constant interruptions or missing opportunities? Again, alone in the house most of the day. This fear worked in reverse, since I had several important updates to put on the site (sales and big exhibits), and I wanted to redesign it first. More tasks coming in at the next stage? Just the review and approval process. Nothing new, but last year a committee was involved and this year just the incoming President. New information (next year's course selection and important dates) arrives whether the site is redesigned or not. Fear of not doing it well enough. They're convinced I'm brilliant. Needlecrafters tend not to be techies, and I already had a very complete and up-to date list all the places to advertise in the town because I do the same job for another guild. Boring, yes. I do three guild sites on the same platform, and they all need pretty-much the same thing. About, Contact, Friends-of, Events, Archives. It doesn't make sense to learn a new platform when this one works, and none of the groups is willing to pay for an upgrade to allow me to get really creative. Fear of wasting time? The current site didn't meet the needs as well as we liked; the new one will. Fear of not knowing the investment required? Experience shows an hour of planning and consultation (done last month), a day of deep multi-tasking focus, and an hour spread over the next week of small updates.<br><br>So, even though each objection was dealt with easily enough, that chart was what made me sit up and start dealing with them. And, as Mark predicted, once I got past the first step of setting up the new page names, the work of copying content, testing, and deleting the old location, went smoothly enough.<br><br>It's definitely a spiral thing. It reminds me of physio and psycho-analysis. Once you shift one thing, another surfaces. Sometimes we resist shifting that first thing because the next one might be scary.</div>
