<div class="content">Right-handed people are never fully aware of how much left-handed people must struggle to survive in this world.  Often lefties aren't aware of the subtle obstacles either.  It took me years to realize that my lousy cutting skills were actually caused by right-handed scissors, not poor coordination.  Coffee mugs get printed on the back side, monogrammed pens are upside down.  I even had to mouse right-handed because in college the short-corded mouse was affixed to the right side of the keyboard.  <br><br>And then there's penmanship.  The rightward motion, right-slanted style is optimized for the right hand.  It is actually much harder to push the pen than to pull.  Essay questions in high school nearly killed me.  Shorthand I found impossible.  To avoid smudging, turn your book clockwise.  Your letters will be sloped wrong, and the schoolmaster would cringe, but it works better.  And even notebooks.  You might not even notice, but writing left->right on the right page of a book, with the spine on the left is a nuisance.  <br><br>The posted SuperFocus rules inadvertently (?) perpetuate this handicap.  With SuperFocus to reenter a task, you have to turn the right page, reach the left hand over the right edge of the page, avoid the right hand, and scribble a task on the next page or last page as appropriate.  Probably most people don't realize how much this minor hassle plays into working.<br><br>SOLUTION: Rebel!  Start noting at the Back of the book.  On the Left page.  Column 1 is the right column, and Column 2 (to rewrite on the previous page) is the Left column.  Now you can simply curl up the page and duck your left hand under to quickly scribble.  You can grab the whole ream of pages in the right hand to reach the Open page, scribble a new item, and just drop them to return to your current page.  MUCH better.  (The ultimate solution is to go Da Vinci and mirror everything, but years of right-schooling make that a tall order,)</div>

<div class="content">Alan, <br><br>I'm with you on the untold challenges of lefties in a right handed world.<br><br>Ever since I came to the realization that no one could tell me that I was writing 'wrong', I have been writing only on the left side(back of page) of notebooks.  Either spiral, ring binders, or bound.  If I'd figure this out sooner, I could have saved years of torment of the sore part of left hand that mashed into spiral metal, or the contortions required to write well by fitting left hand between/on a big steel ring. My handwriting is really bad, and man it would have been great if a 'wise' teacher in school offered this up as an alternative.<br><br>On the smudging, I think the page facing side of my left hand is probably a shade darker than my right probably due to overtime the blue and black ink of pens seeping into the skin.<br><br>As a consolation to lefties and inherit wisdom of our ilk, some of the earliest written language of man must have been written by scholars with their left hands, as no way could write from right to left (in biblical hebrew) with old school non fast drying ink with your right hand and it not smudge everywhere. Who knows if this is truth, but it sounds good enough to me :-)</div>

<div class="content">Some of the most ancient Greek inscriptions go from left to right on one line, then right to left on the next line, and then continuing to alternate for the duration of the inscription.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br>And if my memory plays me right, entirely in majuscule with no punctuation or even spaces between words. Not sure that would work on the SF list!</div>

<div class="content">I was just at the store notebook shopping.  It turns out all those nice double-coil notebooks have the same bias: It's much easier opening to the first pages than to the last.  The coil pattern was setup so the intricate part is all on the back end of the book, inside the back cover.  Fortunately I found one book with a plastic insert inside the back cover which happens to protect the back pages.</div>
