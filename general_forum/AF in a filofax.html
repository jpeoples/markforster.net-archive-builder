<div class="content">I've noticed this mentioned a couple of times as a possibility, but is anyone actually keeping their AF list in a filofax?  If so, how is ti working out?<br><br>I really like the idea of having everything in one place.  I have tried to do this on my laptop but it just doesn't work for me - most of my tasks are not computer based anyway and each time I check my list, there is a real risk I will be led astray by the many distractions of the internet!  So, all in all, I was losing more than I gained.<br><br>Now I am using a small (A6) notebook instead - a cheap Moleskine copy from Rymans - and I like it.  But my calendar, address book and general project notes are mostly still on the laptop.  I'm thinking that a filofax would let me keep them all together.<br><br>Has anyone managed to achieve this?  <br>Which size are you using?   <br>What are the drawbacks?   <br>Does it affect the way you work AF?   <br><br>Thanks!</div>

<div class="content">Yes, I keep my AutoFocus lists in my Filofax, also the notes I make when I'm doing a 'thinking about' session. It's brilliant, with AutoFocus right next to my diary so that I can add time-dependent tasks under the appropriate date without faffing about with a separate notebook. I've printed out Mark's instructions and have them to hand in there, too.<br><br>Filofax make little note-jotters in three colours, too. They're about 3in by 2in, with three punched holes. I use one when necessary to remind myself to collect a library book, say, make a phonecall or do some other quick, pressing task. Then I file the note in the binder opposite the page I'm working on. There's no room for more than three such tasks on one of these little notes, and I tick off the task and tear out the note when they're done.<br><br>The reason all this works so well is that I'm using an A5 size Filofax. I've used it for a number of years as a desk diary, with sections for projects, expenses and so on. I also have a 6-hole punch so that if I print out something on to A5 paper I can put it into the binder. The pages are large enough to write on legibly and have about 34 lines.<br><br>Incidentally, as a professional writer, I set aside hours in the morning and late afternoon when I do nothing but work on the current book. I've found that a simple version of Pomodoro works brilliantly to keep me focused on the job in hand and yet take a four-minute break after 25 minutes. I've always meant to do this in the past, but find a couple of hours have passed before I take that break. Working in 25-minute segments has been noticeably more productive.<br><br>In fact, the combination of AutoFocus for all my non-writing tasks and Pomodoro for writing has been brilliant: I'm half as stressed and twice as productive. What more could one want?<br><br>Cotswold</div>

<div class="content">Hi, Cotswold, thanks for writing such a detailed reply - it sounds like you've got a good set-up there!  <br><br>I was tempted to get an A5, but it would be too big to carry in my handbag.  Then I would have to take a notebook with me and probably end up with too many lists in different places again ....  So I will probably get a Personal, which will (just!) fit  in my handbag. <br><br> I love the idea of having my AF list right next to my diary!  I hope I'll be able to use it for taking notes and keeping project plans too, though it would obviously be too small for any extended writing.  Thanks for the tip about the note-jotters - I will look out for them.  I think the Personal lined paper only has about 20 lines, but I am not worried about that - I haven't noticed any great difference in working my list with different numbers of lines before.<br><br>My feeling is that AF and filofax will be a good combination - thanks for your encouragement!<br><br>acedia xx</div>

<div class="content">Because I live out in the sticks (well, like the Cotswolds), I order my stuff from the Filofax website: www.filofax.co.uk, and that's where you'll find the jotter pads. I recently bought the portable 6-hole punch so that I could print my own pages on the Mac, but it's a pain: I can only punch one page at a time, then disentangle the paper from the punch.<br><br>As well as the A5 I have a personal Filofax that I keep in my handbag, and I thought about using it for AF when I started. The paper I have for it has about 31 lines per page and I find it too fiddly, even though I have small writing.<br><br>Instead, I keep a pocket Moleskine cahier in my handbag and jot down anything that needs to go on the list, and then transfer those tasks to the main list when I get back to my desk. Mind you, I do spend most of my time at my desk, and I always have carried a Moleskine around with me to jot down stuff that I transfer to my computer later.<br><br>Good luck with the Personal, and let us know how you get on.<br><br>Cotswold</div>

<div class="content">Lucky you - living in the Cotswolds!  Not so good for shopping, but wonderful for everything else!   I am in London, so buying stuff is not a problem.  I went to the Filofax store in Conduit Street yesterday - bought some Jot Pads (official name!)  I like being able to file them opposite the relevant page - I'm not a fan of post-it notes.  I didn't actually buy a filofax yet though, I am using an old organiser from W H Smith temporarily, as a sort of rehearsal - I shall go back to buy 'the one' in a couple of days' time.<br><br>That is a shame about the hole punch.  I did read somewhere else that the Filofax hole punch has a sliding panel for cleaning out the paper, but I don't remember now if it was the portable or the desk model - probably the latter.<br><br>You are right about the number of lines on Personal paper.  It's just right for AF in fact.  Writing small enough and neatly enough is a challenge for me, but a good one - it makes me give more attention to how I word items too.   I think it will be fine for AF and lists in general, but probably wouldn't work well for extended writing - not unless you are one of the Brontes! <br><br>Projects are simple too - I will probably use blank paper inserts for mini-mind maps when I start planning something and then make a list on standard lined paper to detail the steps needed at each stage, which I can transfer to my AF list or keep separate, whichever seems more appropriate.  <br><br>I'm not sure what to do about names and addresses.   There are several different formats available, but, again, I think it might be better to use blank paper and write them to suit myself. Also, rather than alphabetical order, I'd prefer to group contacts according the context I associate them with  - work, friends, local groups, book club, home emergency, utilities, etc - and file relevant notes alongside the contact information.  Luckily, no-one else needs to use my address book, so I can make any system I choose!<br><br>Are we really the only two using the AF/ff combination?  It seems such a perfect match, I'm surprised there aren't more of us!<br><br></div>

<div class="content">I'm not using filofax, but I am using a planner binder.  I'm using a compact size Time/Design binder, 31 lines per page.  I played a bit with AF when it was in beta, but I've only seriously just begun to use the method today.  Oops, checking the forum was not on my list!</div>

<div class="content">Hi acedia,<br><br>you are not alone! While my first testing period for AF was in an older notebook it has since then migrated into my filofax.<br><br>Works well that way, but, to tell you the truth, it doesn't really matter. And that is precisely the beauty of Autofocus as a system, it runs virtually anywhere.</div>

<div class="content">Hi fellow filofax fans!  I hope you have fun choosing your filofax, accedia.  I think it is an ideal way to keep the essential info together to keep organised, rather than juggling separate diary, notebook, address book etc.<br><br>I use a personal size filofax for my 'work' organiser - so it has the AF pages, diary pages, project pages (I use the a-z tabs to organise the pages for my various themes and projects and groups/ meetings which I need to keep track of) and reference pages. <br><br>The ff lined paper has rather narrow lines and no margins and the to do pages have too few lines per page so I am still experimenting with the best paper type to use for the AF list.  I have recently found ff squared paper (still with narrow lines, but the squares serve as margins and I am trying that,) and I've also created my own lined paper with 26 lines and margins.  And I also use the jot pads (in the manner of an index card which some AF users put in their notebook) for big tasks to do this week/next week to make sure I focus on those as well as the AF tasks.  I do also use an A4 size notebook to write notes, ideas and workings as I go along eg at meetings etc, and transfer the actions to the AF list, diary or whatever later, but the filofax is the master organiser.<br><br>And I use a pocket size filofax for my personal life which I carry around in the handbag - similar but simpler sections, but including an AF section.  The normal lined pages seem to work ok for this. <br><br>As you might guess I do enjoy using filofax stuff and have to resist buying too many paper types because though they look lovely, I find the choices and formats put too much restriction or add confusion on how to use the pages.<br><br>Thanks for raising this - it would be interesting to hear how others use the paper types/ divisions.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Acedia,<br><br>I have ordered a fairly cheap filofax from Euroffice A5 size after your recommendation in another thread. I am switching from a digital solution to paper after a fairly successful trial of RAF. I have been using an A4 narrow ruled notebook for this until now which is fine when I am at my desk as I can use Outlook for my calendar, but as my work involves travelling to different sites I have come to the conclusion that a portable planner might be the best solution. <br><br>I don't like the idea of having seperate notebooks as I often have thoughts about one site while at another so I would really prefer to replicate my digital system on paper, i.e. one place to capture all the important stuff.</div>

<div class="content">I don't use FiloFax, but in general ...<br><br>I find that seperating my TO DO items and my Planning & Reference items works well.  So, for example:<br><br>My pocket notebook is my TO DO and Capture/Grass Catcher device ... AKA, AutoFocus book.  In it I only have my AF list and everything that flits through my brain goes into that one book.<br><br>My phone numbers are on my cell phone so I don't need to have them written anywhere.  As for addresses, I never write people while I'm out and about so I don't need those with me.<br><br>My calendar lives only partially in my AF book, as a single bi-weekly page for appointments and blocked time.  I reprint that page weekly so that I always this week and next week in view.  But it is only for the purpose of knowing what I should DO right now ... not for planning purposes.<br><br>Now for projects ... I have found it best to stick to DOING things from my AF list and PLANNING in a larger format book/computer.  I only look at my project list when I am in my weekly planing sessions at my desk.  So I keep my project information in a larger format book and on my computer.  (As well as my entire calendar.)  In particular, I "doodle" in a "composition book" and then transfer a cleaned up version to my computer.  I often print those pages out and keep them in a larger format book.  But for daily work, I only consult the tasks I have in my pocket AF book.  I don't find that I need to routinely go back to my project list more than once a week to select a weeks worth of TO DOs to put in my AF book.<br><br>My pocket notebook is a cheap spiral 3x5 with 15 lines per page.  I have no trouble with working AF in that small book.  (Note, recently I've gotten a hold of a Circa/Rollabind book and have been experimenting with that ... it allows moving pages around and there are some benefits to that.  But I'm still experimenting.  In any case, it does not alter the basic idea of keeping the doing and planning separate.)<br><br>I've almost always kept planning and doing as separate functions.  Keeping them in separate books is helpful in that it eliminates distraction.  I'd almost always prefer to plan a thing to death rather than start working on it ;-)<br><br>Note, my context is that I am retired and am often running around doing things, rather than being an office bound worker who sits at a desk all day.  When I was at a desk all day, I did not work from my pocket and so I had a larger format book with everything in it.</div>

<div class="content">Mike,<br><br>I list my projects in OneNote on  my PC. Although there is a case to be made that with AF Projects become less important, I still like to have them as they provide a useful reference point. I'm undecided yet whether I'll move these across to the Filofax, I'll look at the layout and then perhaps give it a try.<br><br> My Contacts are still in Outlook and synchronised to my phone as this works well. The Filofax is going to be used more fore the 2 page per week view as it's the Calendar element I'm not particularly happy with currently. I intend to put major tasks into my Calendar from AF as when I'm away from my desk I don't want to be scanning a long to do list, I find it easier to focus on a few important tasks if they are listed clearly. <br><br>Viewing on a phone is tiresome, and the added advantage of putting a few tasks in my Calendar is that it focuses me on what really needs to get done that day. As I have said previously having different notebooks for different sites hasn't really worked for me so I am going down the paper planner route after years of resisting. Start cheap so it won't hurt if I have to ditch it :-D<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Ashak, <br><br>Glad to hear you are giving it a go and also that you are starting cheap - once you know it works well for you , that is the time to splash out on monogrammed Italian leather!<br><br>A5 is a good choice, especially if with your projects in Outlook - an A4 printout will fold nicely to fit inside your filofax, making it fairly painless to run a combined system.<br><br>There are lots of pre-printed page layouts available from Filofax and other firms, but personally I mainly use lined and blank paper and then just pencil in the headings, columns etc that I want.  But if you are into printing your own pages, then diyplanner.com has some templates.<br><br>The way you organise the filofax will probably evolve as you use it  - it is an extremely flexible system, so you should be able to adapt it, however you like.<br><br>Good luck!</div>
