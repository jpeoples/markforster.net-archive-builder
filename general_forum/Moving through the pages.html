<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-02-3 21:57</div>
<div class="content">I'm still finding Autofocus to have all sorts of great benefits, but there's one thing that isn't working for me yet: I'm not going through all my pages at least once a day. Far from it, in fact. A couple of days ago I got through almost half the pages, and that was a good day. In January this wasn't really an issue for me, as it was rare that anything was terribly urgent, because the institution I teach at was on a break. But now the new semester's started up, I'm much more likely to add something to the list that needs to be addressed in the next couple of days, say; and I'm taking more than a couple of days, on average, to cycle through. As a result, I'm starting to feel some anxiety and stress, and to have to break the rules to make deadlines on occasion. (I'm also only coming back to 'Email' every few days. The plus side is that I'm spending a lot less time on email, which is a good thing; but I'm also not really on top of it, for the first time since I adopted DIT.)<br><br>In a forum posting a little while ago, Mark, you addressed this issue explicitly, and advised tuning one's "little and often" knob to ensure that one moves through the whole list at least once a day. I'm wondering if you, or anyone else, can give me advice about _how_ to do that; and more specifically, how to do it without violating the principles of Autofocus.<br><br>Here's what I mean: In order to increase the rate at which I move through the list as a whole, I'd need to <br><br>(a) reduce the average time per item worked on, or<br>(b) reduce the average number of items per page I work on, or<br>(c) both<br><br>(Increasing the "little and often"-ness of my approach would presumably be a matter of doing (a).) But how do I do (a) whilst sticking to the principle that one should work on a given item (once picked) for as long as one feels like it (given that that's what I've been doing so far)? And how do I do (b) whilst sticking to the principle that one should do some work on each item that stands out (given that all the items I've been working on are ones that stand out)?<br><br>This is really the only issue I'm having with Autofocus at this point; but I'm worried it could become a big one.<br><br>Incidentally, in case it's relevant, I don't think my list is exceptionally long. I currently have 22 pages active, with about 120-130 "live" items altogether. (I know of at least a couple of pages that'll get dismissed next time around – or so I predict – but it's taking me a while to get back there....)<br><br>Thanks.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Increasing "little and often" involves c), both reducing the number of items you do on a page and the amount of time you spend on each items.<br><br>It's a simple matter of adjusting your mental sensitivity so that you are a) less tolerant to working for a long time on an item and b) require a greater degree of "standing out" before you take on an item.<br><br>If you have trouble doing this, then you might want to consider training your mind by a) setting a maximum time you can work on any one item and b) setting a maximum number of items you can do each time you visit a page.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Martin<br><br>Don't feel that you're the only one finding the need to adjust like this.  I've posted before that I strongly believe that we will be having to make adjustments and/or work outside the system on occasion whilst we are getting used to it - and it is getting used to us!  I only cleared my first page today and have been unable to cycle through the pages at all for the past week or more.  Today I had only half a day "discretionary" time and worked on approx half of my pages - that is frustrating but as my early pages only have one or two items left I know that I can move more quickly - and I do make a point of reviewing all of my items so that if something is urgent then it will get done.<br><br>What I am noticing is that the wording of, and type of, tasks on my later pages is quite different to my earlier pages.  In addition I have actually changed, added to or improved a lot of my systems as a result of AF, as it has highlighted areas where I could streamline my working practices.<br><br>Although it feels like AF has been around for ever - it is in fact less than a month - and the amount of change I personally have initiated as a result is quite frankly amazing.  It will however take time for those changes to filter through - and for my backlogs to clear.  At present I do not feel I am using AF to it's full potential because of that legacy input - but it is improving all the time ......<br></div>

<div class="content">The name "Autofocus" suggests that the more we do the system, the more we engage in some kind of psychic balancing. How we feel about an item will certainly be influenced by how many open pages and open items we have.<br><br>Martin has certainly stated in a very clear way, how things feel when we are getting overwhelmed by our commitments. In my very first two days of implementing Autofocus, that was precisely how I felt. I would repeat here what Mark suggested to me at that time: use a notebook with more lines. It does allow me to progress more quickly through the pages.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-02-4 17:01</div>
<div class="content">Mark: I'd like to play devil's advocate here, having thought about this a bit more. Why isn't the approach you've suggested – training one's mind in the way you suggest above – a significant shift in the whole idea behind Autofocus? As originally presented, the idea was that by following the rules about lists, pages, standing out, etc., you'd find yourself making good judgements about what to do when, and how long to spend on it, just by following your intuition (seeing what stands out, working on things for as long as you feel like it). But the adjustment, or training, you describe above amounts to saying: unless it's not working for you, in which case your intuitions aren't leading you in the right direction, and you shouldn't follow them. (You shouldn't work on all the items that stand out, or work on things for as long as you feel like it.) Instead, you should try to develop new intuitions, so to speak.<br><br>That's stated a bit polemically, for the sake of vividness, but I am worried about the issue I'm presenting. (It also seems to me that the guideline that you should try and make sure you're moving through your entire list at least once a day is a significant amendment, and should count as one of the basic rules of the system.)<br><br>Christine, Moises: Thanks for the supportive words. It could be a backlog issue in my case, too, Christine, but if so, it'll take a while to clear (several months, given the projects I'm working on and their deadlines), and I need to think about how to proceed in the meantime. And I'm already using 30 lines per page, moises...why would increasing the number mean moving faster?<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Martin,<br><br>This reply just addresses the very narrow question you directed at me. <br><br>Assume I have 300 tasks and 20 tasks/page. That gives me 15 pages. If the rules stipulate that I must make at least one cycle through the notebook each day, and I must do at least one item/page, I will do a minimum of 15 items.<br><br>If I have the same 300 tasks on 30 tasks/page paper, I have 10 pages and a requirement to do 10 items. That enables me to cycle through the list more quickly.</div>

<div class="content">I have a work list and a home list.  I'm only on the 5th page of my 40 lines per page notebook at work and I started not long after this beta began.  The first 3 pages are mostly cleared, except for a few items.  The 4th is maybe half or more cleared.  The 5th page just has 7 items on it.  Many items appear again and again, as I've made some progress and then moved them to the end of the list.  So, my 4+ pages aren't even all new items.  I can't quite imagine having as many as you've described, Martin - I would love to see what's on yours.  I haven't dumped any significant backlog into it - I have GTD lists that I haven't gone through, but I'm planning to sort through those and add items gradually, rather than overwhelming the system, as Mark phrases it.  It's been working for me, although I'm still an awful procrastinator.  But, I still see many good things coming out of this for me.</div>

<div class="content">Martin:<br><br>I was addressing a specific problem that you presented, i.e. that you did not feel that you were moving fast enough through the list for the likely workload that you would have in the near future. <br><br>But on reflection, my answer is "trust the system".<br><br>I have been using AF longer than anyone else, and what I am finding is that my journey through the pages has changed. Instead of doing a few items on each page, and therefore moving quite quickly through them, I am now spending most of my time on the pages near the end of the list (often doing nearly every item on a new page) and only going back through old items every two or three days. This has happened without any conscious volition on my part.<br><br>Whichever way I do it, it seems to work fine - just so long as I allow the system to set the pace. Whenever I try to buck the system, I find resistance growing.</div>
<h2>Reply by Christine B</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-02-4 20:02</div>
<div class="content">Mark<br><br>I am finding that "trusting the system" really is working well for me BUT I do have some problems with some things not getting done as quickly as I believe (rationally) they should, or perhaps I should say as I would like them to be done.  I can see that this has a lot to do with the fact that my discretionery time is somewhat limited, plus the fact that I have backlogs, and though irritating the tasks are not necessarily important but have the potential to become so.<br><br>The number of open pages I have and the number of open items is not worrying me but I would like to be moving through my pages more quickly.  Because the reason for not doing so is more linked to lack of discretionary time than anything I have resisted the "one item per page" approach because I feel that would make me see the list more as one long list than as closed lists, and it has just "not felt right" to do that.  However there are a number of tasks that I believe should be prioritised.  I don't feel strongly enough about the items that I should use the Common Sense approach to "just do them". Neither do I feel they are same day items to be actioned from an index card or similar.<br><br>If anything the specific tasks causing concern in this particular instance would be more an issue of context - i.e. "home" as opposed to "work" type items.  Initially when I started with the lists it was the home type items that stood out (I am using one list for work and home items - which I want to continue).  Now it is the work type items that are standing out, on which I will generally work for longer anyway.  I really don't want to try limiting the time by anything other than the "for as long as I feel like" rule.  However if I am going to avoid living somewhere that looks like the set of a police drama after a burglary I need to do something!  <br><br>My idea at present is to temporarily split out the home items to a separate list and to just work from that list, in the manner of a separate location, for a period of time. However, it strikes me that an extracted list of "urgentish" items could be a solution as a form of "emergency procedure" to be used on rare occasions only when faced with a backlog related or deadline related emergency.<br><br>It seems to me that, with a number of us struggling with legacy backlogs, looming deadlines or just a period of temporary overload that should even out when AF is more established, that some form of "emergency procedure" would be helpful. Using the concept of a separate location list would seem to be a solution in this case but I wondered if you had found this to be an issue at any point in your own journey to date, or whether you see any major problems with that as an approach. My feeling is that such an approach, if used as an "emergency procedure" would have to be legislated as an exception and short term option only as the "extracted lists" would contain rationally determined priority items, even if actioned in an AF manner.<br><br>It would be my intention to still keep the items within the original lists and cross them off as appropriate, which would still retain the dismissal point of remaining items on the relevant pages.  <br><br>I would very much appreciate your input on this Mark in case you can see some major flaws in my plan or have some infinitely simpler approach :-)  Thank you!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark<br><br>I know it is less than 24 hours since I posted the above, and the approach above has it's merits in that some of the things are getting done, but I am finding that it does detract from the AF system.  I think the problem is that, because the items have been extracted from partially completed pages, they have almost carried with them a degree of resistance.  It's odd because they seem to have more resistance than when left on the original page.<br><br>Going back to to AF feels somehow right.  My rational mind says I haven't given it a long enough trial but actually the way I feel about going back to AF is such a relief that I know I have. I am glad I tried this "tweak" becauase proving something doesn't work is as valuable as finding something that does.  I know I will be a lot happier just doing some of those things "outside the system" if necessary while the backlog element and overall benefits of the system settle down for me, rather than trying to find some way around the problem.<br><br>Nevertheless, Mark, I would assume you have already hit these problems so if you have any further insights I would be grateful.  Part of me says the above "tweak" should work so if you can add to that it would be really helpful.<br><br>Thanks!</div>

A very good example is that it has consistently dismissed any attempts by me to move the Beta testing on to the next stage. Today I realised why. Watch this space!</div>

<div class="content">moises:<br><br>Thanks for the reply. You're right, of course, that using pages with more lines (but holding the total number of items fixed) will mean that I *can* complete a cycle through my pages in less time – namely, by doing only one item per page (and holding the average time per item fixed). But it doesn't follow that I *will* complete a cycle any quicker, if I stick to the core principle that I work on each item that stands out. Given that constraint, there's no reason to think I'll complete a cycle any quicker unless there's some reason to think that having more lines per page will mean either that fewer items stand out, or that my average time per item will go down (or both).</div>

<div class="content">Martin,<br><br>And you, of course, are correct both in that "can" does not imply "will," and that AF appears to require us to adjust our intuitions.<br><br>The rules of AF provide us with a new structure for working. Our old intuitions about how long to work on a task will not serve us well in this new structure of AF. If we can’t adjust our intuitions, AF won’t work well.<br><br>I no longer “feel” like working as long on items. Consciously, I know that if I do work a long time, I will get bogged down, possibly neglecting other items on my list. Presumably, over time, these conscious thoughts stop being conscious and they become intuitive habits and feelings.<br><br>If I still feel like working too long on Project A, when Project B is calling out for attention, then AF is not working.<br><br>You point out that the original formulation of AF made no mention of the need to adjust intuition. But now that it does, is that a fault in AF?<br><br>Presumably, we had some flawed intuitions going into AF, or we wouldn’t have felt the need to try AF. If AF encourages us to adjust our intuitions so that we move towards a more optimal use of our time, we would all welcome it.<br></div>

<div class="meta">2009-02-6 22:27</div>
<div class="content">moises<br><br>A question - is it that AF is adjusting our intuition or is it that we are allowing our intuition to adjust itself as opposed to restricting it with our logic?  I feel that our intuition is almost in some ways like a child finding it's feet and gradually learning that it has the ability itself to think and to assess things, rather than being restricted by what it's always been told to do. <br><br>Just a thought to fling into the pot ....... :-)</div>

<div class="content">I struggled for several weeks with my Autofocus list moving "too slowly".  I had 45 pages and over 800 active tasks.  It just moved too slowly to be effective.  I tried several things to deal with that.<br><br>For me, the main problem with moving slowly was that I had important tasks with hard deadlines, but I wasn't moving quickly enough through the list to see them even once.  <br><br>Also, I was losing track of the overall list -- I just didn't have a "feel" for the pages that I hadn't seen in several days.<br><br>A couple things really helped with this:<br><br>1. "Dismiss" the entire Autofocus notebook, and *start over*.  Just get a new notebook, and jot down the things that are most pressing, the things that are on your mind.  Be sure to add a recurring task, "transfer some items from the old AF list", to make sure that you aren't forgetting something important.  Otherwise, just count the entire old list as "dismissed".<br><br>2. Deliberately add duplicate entries for important items, and for items that may need to be done several times a day such as "check email".  After a bit of working the system, you'll find that you get these tasks scattered all through your active pages, especially towards the end.  It helps ensure that you see them frequently and have the opportunity to do the "little and often" thing.<br><br>3. Use different books for different contexts, and use your calendar/time boxes to determine the contexts.  I resisted this for a long time, since I liked the way Autofocus itself would steer me into one context or another.  But having tried it both ways, I feel more focused and move more quickly through the list when the personal and work are separated.<br><br>4. Use project folders to keep track of project tasks.  (A "folder" can be in Outlook, on your hard drive, a manilla folder in the cabinet, a box of stuff on the shelf, whatever).  In the AF notebook, just write "clear tasks for Project X".  Try to put project-related tasks into that folder, and not on your AF list.  If it's a really large project, with dozens or hundreds of tasks, then maybe make a new "context" for it, and treat it in the same category that you treat "work" and "personal", with time blocked out on your calendar specifically for that project, and with its very own Autofocus notebook.<br><br>5. Don't be afraid to dismiss.  This is a new one for me, and I haven't really got the hang of it yet (I still strongly resist dismissing things), but I think it will help even more...<br><br>The common theme with all these ideas is to keep your AF list "lean and mean", not to let it get clogged up with distractions and too much detail that really belongs somewhere else.</div>

<div class="content">Christine,<br><br>A week or so ago Martin asked Mark what was rational about AF. I believe the response what that there was a law-like regularity to the rules that provided rationality: add new items to the end of the list, go through the pages sequentially, do at least one item per page.<br><br>That is the rational structure of AF.<br><br>I think we also call a process rational when we consciously engage in means-ends deliberations. I want groceries, that's my end. I then consciously say, OK, the best way for me to obtain this end is to wait till work is over and drive to the market on the way home.<br><br>What does the intuition do? Presumably it tells us when to start working on an AF item and when to stop (among other things). For intuition to work, it must discriminate between constraints that can be changed and those that cannnot.<br><br>If we develop the AF habit, our intuition learns that the rules of AF are one of the constraints on our behavior. It then calculates what strategy to follow using those constraints.<br><br>Gravity is a constraint. The need to eat and sleep are constraints. Intuition throws all these variables into the equation and spits out a result. <br><br>I agree with your claim that the intuition thinks and assesses. What distinguishes it from rational thinking and assessing is that it does not involve conscious deliberation. But, I would assert, it still takes into account the existing situation. It distinguishes between things that can be done (drive to the store) and things that can't be done (fly to the store by flapping my arms). Once the AF rules are firmly established, the intuition arrives at a decision that takes the AF rules into account.</div>

<div class="content">moises<br><br>I completely agree with you.  Our subconscious "still takes into account the existing situation. It distinguishes between things that can be done (drive to the store) and things that can't be done (fly to the store by flapping my arms)."  What I think is remarkable is that our subconscious has absorbed all of the learning we have, the "rules" of rationality such as in your excellent example, the rules of AF and also our own moral and ethical quidelines, and then produces that assessment as you say without conscious deliberation.<br><br>That takes just so much pressure off of our conscious mind that we can spend it in conscious deliberation of the actual task we are doing, rather than it being hindered by all of the vague anxieties of our "stuff".</div>

<div class="content">Hi all<br>I had a similar epiphany as Seraphin.  I put my entire Autofocus in the shredder and started anew......listing ONLY things that were either required of me or goals and projects I decided to put a deadline on. I, then, schedule blocks of time to this list.  Reading these things keeps me assured of properly keeping track and it also gives the ABSOLUTE FREEDOM to use the rest of my time to live as I most want to at the time....It could be anything from cooking a fine meal to going on (another) hyperfocus jag of creating art, music, writing or creating pleasure with my social circle.  Oddly enough, this new method has made other things welcomed options.  i.e.  I actually spint over 3 hours white gloving the house because I completed the minimum upkeep posted on the list.  I, then, painted the walls and then, I welded a new table.  I've found that doing mindless work allows my mind to put the pieces together to do my creative endeavors whilst getting "optional" chores (purposely not on the autofocus list) done.  The focus is no longer on filing, cleaning to get it done.  Rather, it's an activity that gets done as a by-product while I use the time to prime my brain for my passions.<br>I feel much freer working from a short autofocus list that's designed to cover my ass and meet my responsibilities so that I can freely hyperfocus on my art, music, writing, etc or spend time with people I enjoy.  <br>Now, I love my autofocus list......because I figured out how to make it effective for me.  I guess I've been brain-washed to meet my responsibilites first and then I am FREE to love my life however I wish.  I've never needed a list to guide that!  LOL!.......just a calendar so that I don't forget to show up or meet deadlines.<br>It's been a week with my "lean and mean" list as Seraphin so aptly described it.  I'm over the moon with the results so far!  (I don't have to fear my short-term memory nor curse my disabilities.  Mostly, when I'm more up to par, I feel safe to guiltlessly and fearlessly embrace my discretionary time for which I don't need to refer to a list at all.  My intuition is front and center when my health and time permits it.<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>Maybe it's my rearing, but when I feel myself rebelling against a responsibility or to move forward on one of my goals, it creates an instinct in me to want to do it just to feel like my better side won!  I may not relish the procedure but I love the feeling of victory.  It's silly but it works for me...even if I need to keep re-starting until I feel satisfied that my better side reigned supreme afterwards.  (I've been known to reduce my starts to as low as 5 minutes to make sure I do start.......slow victory to be sure......but victory none the less!  *blush*  It's like sports.....most of the winning strategy is to stay in the game giving it your all.

<div class="content">Hi moises:<br><br>I'm responding here mainly to your Feb 6th post, but bearing your Feb 7th post in mind.<br><br>For the purposes of this post, I'll call the system laid out in Mark's original instructions 'AF1', and I'll use 'AF2' as a label for the system we get if we combine those instructions with the added instruction to try and make sure that you rotate through all your pages at least once a day, adjusting your intuitions (/ twiddling your "little and often" knob) to do so (if necessary). So AF1 doesn't say anything about adjusting one's intuitions, but AF2 does.<br><br>(Footnote: I'm not sure that, as I've set it up, AF2 is internally consistent. If not, though, some minor reformulating would fix that.)<br><br>First, a small point. Given Mark's Feb 4th post on this thread (and perhaps his Feb 7th post), it's not clear to me which system is AF at this point. I read the Feb 4th post as suggesting that Mark's inclined to drop the additional instruction after all, and revert to AF1. So it's not clear to me that AF does now make mention of the need to adjust our intuitions.<br><br>More important, though, is the question you ask in your penultimate paragraph: Is it a fault of AF2 that it requires some of us (at least) to work on adjusting our intuitions? I'd say yes, at least for me. That is, at least for me, it's a problem with AF2 that it requires that. As soon as I start trying to adjust my intuitions in the sort of way Mark describes, I feel resistance, anxiety, and stress. I automatically start looking at the page as a whole, deliberating about which X items are the most important or urgent, calculating ahead to think about how much time I can afford to spend on this page, etc. That seems very much at odds with the intended spirit of AF, as I understand it, but perhaps more importantly (again), it just doesn't work very well for me (because of the stress, resistance, and anxiety, and resulting lessening of productivity). A big part of the appeal of AF1, and what makes it work for me so much of the time, and in so many ways, is the fact that I can follow my (unreconstructed) intuitions (about whether to work on a given item, and how long to work on it for, given that I have the rules of AF1 at the back of my mind). AF1 hasn't worked *perfectly* for me, certainly – hence the first post on this thread – but it seems to work much better than AF2. (Which also seems to be what Mark is reporting about his own case in his Feb 4th post, as I understand him.)<br><br>It's also worth distinguishing between finding that one's behaviour changes spontaneously when using AF1, and consciously or deliberately trying to adjust one's intuitions so that one's behaviour changes. I've also found that I'm much happier than before to do just a little work on something, but that's been a spontaneous change, and not the result of a conscious attempt to adopt a little and often approach, to adjust my intuitions, etc.<br><br>Last point: I'm not at all sure that the fact that someone wasn't managing her time well, and so wanted to try AF, means that she had some flawed intuitions. It could be, instead, that she wasn't trusting her intuitions sufficiently, or letting them be a big enough factor in guiding her behaviour. Alternatively, it could be that the system within which she was making intuitive judgements was badly designed, or not as well designed as AF. And for what it's worth, my suspicion is that one of these other two diagnoses (or some combination of them) applies in at least some cases, including my own.<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine<br>I have a different view.  Sure, some responsibilities seem senseless, but most of my responsibilities have guided me to develop to be the best me I can be.  Just because something is a challenge, doesn't mean it's imprisioning me.  Example:  I dreaded the aspect of technically improving my skills for the instruments I played.  But....without that, I couldn't express myself as well or know how to write the composition for others to play.  Same with learning the rudiements of using various art mediums or practicing dance or sports.  The boring aspects of mastery almost always reap rewards when it's time to create or share......<br>I find housework and office work tedious, but I find chaos, filth and missed deadlines far worse.  Ultimately, I only do what ultimately rewards me unless my judgement got polluted!  LOL!  Even as a rebellious child, I did what I was supposed to do mostly because I ultimately knew there was a good reason for the sacrifice of immediate gratification........It's the same for everybody I'd assume.  The only difference I'm experimenting with is attitude after hearing Michelle and Barack Obame talking about him having to wash the dinner dishes.  He said that he found it soothing.................She retorted in a challenging manner, "Since when did you ever WANT to sooth yourself by washing the dishes?"  His response was,  "I had to do it so I  DECIDED to MAKE it soothing!"  The bells went off in my head!   I hope it lasts!  LOL<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Hi learning as I go<br><br>Loved the reference to the Obama interview - sounds like they have a good balance!  You are absolutely right in that there are things that we do have to do and making sure we have a system in place is a vital part of life, whether that be a system for housework so we don't descend into chaos or the structure of a work day, or even the structure of using AF.  What is damaging however is the belief that we have to get "everything that we ought to do" out of the way before we can do what we want.  That is fine when what "ought" to be done is very specific and time or task limited (such as homework, music practice, doing the dishes etc) but if that translates into "everything" which it can well do, then we run the risk of never making the time for the things that are really important in our lives, or else we feel guilty when we do.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine<br>I never thought about it from that angle.  For me, I needed to learn how to feel OK even when I can't remember.  Also I've always known why I'd struggle.  I was either in a learning/discovery or on a lazy streak.  Now add pain, meds or brain limitations.  Same resolution........shoulder into it or switch to something I can do for awhile.  I especially hate when it's my laziness that's forcing me to get over the hump.  It requires me being far more cagey than plugging through pain or a meds high....ironic isn't it?  *blush*  But then again, I think the lack of confidence in my thinking or my higher pain levels contribute to some of my unwillingness.  I'm simply put in the position of getting through it.  Most times the resistance lessens with the artificial jump starts when it's pure laziness.  When it's because of the pain, I simply have to trick my brain to keep at it.  My doctors assure me that I'm not further harming my body, so I'm safe to keep on even when it hurts.  That's a large part of the reason I created my scut cap!  LOL!  After the scut work is done, I'm free to do as I want with my focus and my time....even to do nothing until the pain subsides!  LOL!  Other times, I'm lucky when the pain AND the laziness fall away and I'm free to choose something close to not being disabled!

<div class="content">Hi learning as I go<br><br>Interesting that you say "I've always known why I'd struggle. I was either in a learning/discovery or on a lazy streak."  I used to put it slightly differently in my case - either something interested and motivated me or I was on a lazy streak.  However I now realise that it wasn't actually a lazy streak at all and I suspect if you look at it that is probably true for you too.  To me the concept of being lazy (other than "allowed laziness" eg on holiday) was a very negative emotion, linked to feelings that I ought to be motivated and was obviously pretty useless if I wasn't.  <br><br>What I came to realise after a while was that it was not laziness but procrastination - and there IS a big difference.  I could, or so I thought identify the reasons for that procrastination but that did not necessarily help a great deal.  Yes I could create systems to manage it, like your scut work system, but that only managed the situation and did not cure it.  I could identify some of the emotions linked to the procrastination, excuse and/or justify it, recognise some of the influences that had led to that state but there I stuck.  I knew there were more answers but didn't really have the time, energy or inclination to search them out.<br><br>It seems that AF has given me that time and space to look at those things, but in a perfectly safe and non-threatening way.  From reading your posts I would venture to suggest that the last thing you are - or that you were before your accident - is lazy. You may have procrastinated, you may have had concerns linked to feeling that you "ought" to do more than you really needed to, but that is not the same as laziness.<br><br>Something else to think about .....?  :-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine<br>I was taught that laziness was either not meeting your responsibilities in a real sense or prefering not to do something, yet doing it anyway because you are actually reliable despite lazy thinking.  The free pass for lazy thinking was to not allow it to ruin your motivations!  LOL!  Maybe I got a free pass because I DID MEET my responsibilites even though I did things differently than most other folks.  You are correct.  I'd go to my dad asking how to get rid of useless lazy thinking and he told me that if I managed to work around the attitude and still manage to meet my responsibilities and aims, then it's OK because everybody has things they either prefer not to do (His was filling out his tax forms) He changed my life when he taught me to get the scut work out of the way and work a good plan to accomplish my goals and to live the remaining time doing whatever makes me feel gratitude for being alive!  LOL!  To me, procrastination is simply acting on laziness.  Delaying or deferring connotes rational decisions.  I suppose we're all affected by semantics and the culture that taught us how to use language.  In our household, our schools and all my places of employment regarded laziness almost as badly as lying or theft!  LOL!  But if I was reliable and got excellent results......it didn't matter that I was lazy in my thinking as long as it didn't control too many of my important decisions!  LOL!  I suspect that everybody has areas of lazy thinking.  If you've met your obligations and you feel satified with progressing on your aims, then relaxation is a reward.......I prefer the second choice to the times I'm a stubborn donkey in my brain.

I think you're right about the way that semantics and culture have a major influence on how we see things, and don't you think also that we build our own little structures based on culture, upbringing, and learned acceptable behavioural standards?  It is absolutely the right thing to build the right structures to enable us to meet our obligations and also to enable us to move towards our goals.  I just think we need to be  careful sometimes to be sure that they are true obligations and that the goals and expectations are "our" goals and not ones that have somehow been imposed upon us, by that same culture or whatever.</div>

<div class="content">AF is working great for me. And I'm always interested in the finer points, so here goes.<br><br>Being a mathematician, the # of items per page is an interesting point.  Moises' analysis is easy to understand ... more items per page means you move through the pages faster.  Until....<br><br>Once you complete some random number of items on each existin pages, and add another 10 pages of items ... it takes longer to get through all the pages ... and longer to complete each page since it has more items on it.<br><br>There's some kind of mathematical formula here, and I really want to understand it, except... I don't think it matters.  For me.  Whether there are 10 items or 100 per page, my movements through the pages won't be affected.  After you've completed 90 of 100 items on a page ... it's a 10-item page.  That *sounds* like it's different from starting with a 10-item page... but it's not, since there is no restriction on what you add to the list.<br><br>Whether the 10 items are the distillation of 100 items --- or 10 items I added organically -- the page still page 10 items on it now.  10 items left to be done.

<div class="content">Martin,<br><br>I was drawn to your initial, February 3, post, because it mirrored my own experiences. My first two days of AF (as AF1) were very hectic and I felt, like you, considerable "anxiety and stress." In fact, those negative feelings were so intense that I stopped doing AF1 for a day, in order to reevaluate the entire process. <br><br>I could well see that AF1 might be a real boon in the relatively low-stress environment between semesters. I could empathize with the anxiety and stress of doing AF1 in the more intense situations that you face during the semester.<br><br>After my 1-day hiatus from AF1, I made some changes. I started using a 34-lined notebook with the spiral at the top, I pulled my recurrent tasks out of AF and onto a daily list that I keep on my desk in front of me, I implemented the rule to do at least one item per page (or dismiss the page), and I implemented the rule to cycle through all open pages once per day.<br><br>So, I moved from something like AF1 to something like AF2. I knew that if I lingered too long on any given item, there was a good chance I might not make it through all the open pages. So, I moved towards littler and oftener.<br><br>From your post of February 7, it sounds like your "resistance, anxiety, and stress" with AF2 is even greater than the "anxiety and stress" you had with AF1. So, yes, it sounds to me as if you would be better off reverting to AF1.<br><br>I don't know if it's how I am constituted, or the nature of my job, but there's no way I could survive looking at e-mail once every few days. For me, the move from AF1 to AF2 meant moving from an intolerable, unworkable system, to a tolerable, working system. I still experience significant stress and anxiety--I am running a business in the midst of an economic crisis. But, with something like AF2, I am able--despite the stress and anxiety--to keep the system going.<br><br><br>You and I both felt some negative emotions with AF1. We both responded by trying AF2. You found that you were worse off with AF2; I found that I was better off.<br><br>I would have preferred to have had the outcome you had. I would have preferred to have found myself better off with my unreconstructed intuitions. But I believe that my version of AF2 is better than AF1 for my constitution and my environment, and it is better than any known alternatives.</div>

<div class="content">slothbear<br><br>There is actually another factor that comes into play with the number of lines on a page, namely the structured procrastination effect.  By the time you reach the 10 items out of 100 you will already have resisted them the number of times you have cycled through that page.  That resistance itself is one of the keys to identifying your true feelings about those items - which will eventually have to be addressed or the items dismissed.  With only 10 items per page that element of AF is significantly reduced.</div>

I think we have all tried AF1 and AF2 or other variations and I think some of the "tweaks" will work well in certain circumstances.  Mark has been quick to point out that some of the suggestions he has made, such as cycling through the pages more frequently, were tailored to specific situations, and I think that we will all need those options at times.  I now have "check email" on every page but still feel the need to check it on occasion "outside of the system" (Shock! Horror!)  You may find AF2 is what you need at this point in time but that you will be able to revert to AF1 at a later time (with AF2 still available if needed again in the future).</div>

<div class="content">An electronic notebook, in stead of a paper one, would that make any difference? <br>Of course I'd keep the number of lines per page, the number of pages, etc. as instructed.<br>The reason for me is: I write an entry or re-entry a lot faster by typing it.<br>Would love to hear your comments on this.</div>

<div class="content">Dear Mark, <br><br>I think the advantage of Do It Tomorrow is that you can draw a line under today's tasks, allowing one to turn off, whereas with Autofocus, there is no line- finishing a page if you can dismiss some and ignore others is too vague and not satisfying enough, and having 25-30 items to try and complete while you are adding pages to do is too many.  The major benefit of Do it tomorrow was identifying what was reasonable in a day, drawing a line under it, and reevaluating one's commitments if this was not happening. Reading through your contributors who have the energy to work up to 25 pages is exhausting, and they seem to be exhausted, even if they have time to spend several hours a day reading this blog!<br><br>I think your good idea would be best served by having a) specific tasks (as per your abstract/concrete comment) and, as per GTD, which can be performed concretely and b) only a number of lines per page which can be fulfilled within a day to make it more workable ie 10-15 not 25-30. Those items not done at the end of the day should be re-entered at a new page. A priority should be made of closing a page, which should be more achieveable if the goals are more specific and concrete, moving a project forward, and allowing the next step to be made the next day, rather than ten pages hence, and allowing closure for the day's work. Achieving more by having more things hanging over one as unfinished items, especially if there are 10 or 25 pages of them, dismissed or otherwise, doesn't seem much of an advance. <br><br></div>

<div class="content">Ton from Utrecht<br><br>Hi.  You may find it helpful to look at the FAQ post which has links to a number of discussions including those on electronic vs paper systems.<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/645945" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/645945</a><br><br>My personal view is that the system works best on paper but I am a techie and do love electronic versions of things too.  I have AF set up in MS OneNote also but feed that from my paper notebook which is the real heart of the system for me.  Details of my OneNote setup are included under the above post, as are options using Outlook and various handheld device options.<br><br>Hope that helps .....</div>

<div class="content">Craig<br><br>The difference with AF is that it works with "ungraded" items.  With DIT (which is a great system) you have little flexibility about the tasks that you are required to do in a day, only over when in the day you do them.  AF goes not just a step further but almost infinitely further.<br><br>The idea is not to complete pages in one go, or even a specific number of items in a day.  I personally may have 25+ active pages but many of those pages have only one or two items remaining.  Some days I may complete 50 or 60 items, others only 10 or 20 or even less.<br><br>I suspect that you are probably fairly new to this and may not yet have tried the system.  The benefits are not easy to see until you try it.  Actually it is probably quite easy to get bogged down if you try to examine it too deeply - or read too much on the forum - before getting stuck in.  Give it a go for a while and see how you get on ........<br><br>Good luck <br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine<br>I tweeked DIT into a weekly format to include both meeting my responsibilities and to move my goals forward...........with PLENTY of flex time scheduled in.  Once my responsibilities are properly met, the path is clear for me to pursue both my creative aims and to best enjoy my other passions (and people). My meta-value is my quality of life both immediately and across my lifespan.  Although My DIT is my customized hybrid method, it's been working quite well.  Using a weekly format and diligently staying current leaves me plenty of flexibility to jump on wonderful opportunities, go on extended creative jags and do whatever else I like whilst meeting my responsibilities and forwarding my goals.  My favorite aspect of DIT is the current initiative.  No matter how I feel, I love looking forward to commencing with my current initiative first thing each day.  It's also enjoyable to move onto the next one in the queque.  Thanks, Mark for the Current Initiative.  On particular hard days, working on my current initiative and eating well can be the high point of the day!  *blush*<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Hi learning as I go<br><br>I too loved the concept of the current initiative within DIT - although could never quite keep it to just one :-)  What I love about the way that AF is working for me, is that by using it with my Project (or Current Initiative) Management system, I can see my goals progressing so much more clearly. The "first thing" rule never sat well with me - that part of me that doesn't like being told when to do something I guess :-) - but being able to do it "when I feel like it" - ah now that really does it for me!  <br><br>Funny but I'd not consciously built flex time into my daily schedule, but with AF I am finding it IS happening.  The main benefit of that is time to think - something I don't feel I have been doing effectively for quite some time!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine<br>It's hard for me to articulate the difference between the Current Initiative and projects that I'm currently working on.  Both are important  and being worked on yet, the current initiative has a hard to describe dissimilar orientation.  I look forward to doing my current initiative as my first thing to do.  I regard it as a positive launching pad to commence my workload and other activities of the day.  Of course, it doesn't precede my regular morning ritual.  I could hardly start it before hygiene, allowing the dog to relieve herself, etc.....Yet, many people do exactly that!  LOL!  "To each his own....."<br>Everybody thinks and does differently I suppose.  I, too, have strong individualistic tendencies, but not toward my own choices. I can both run my own game and be an effective team player so long as I am given enough latitude to do things in my own fashion. I litterally BRISTLE when ANYBODY tries to boss me and will either stonewall them or shut them out.  Yet, I can be counted on to do my part if I'm properly considered. However, when I obey my own directives, I feel self-suppoting!  LOL!<br>I've always respected flex time. I have a great advantage as my father trained me well how to both plan and how to appreciate being extemporaneous!  He was my example.  He managed to be a serious surgeon, researcher, professor and philanthropist and....and the neighborhood's Pied Piper of Hamilton!  LOL!  His example continues to inspire me...He truly loved being of service and offering up joy.<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Hi learning as I go<br><br>I always had good intentions regarding my Current Initiatives, which were generally backlogs (I was great at creating those!) but think I did manage to confuse them with my projects.  Great technique for dealing with backlogs - confuse it with something else in the hope that it'll go away!  :-) Can't quite see why that didn't work......... :-)<br><br>Funny my backlogs are being cleared quite nicely now - not magically, not at the speed of light, but steadily and surely.<br><br>Hope you're having a good day today - it's feeling like a real Spring morning here so a good day for being motivated!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine<br>My Current Initiative was my backlog.....ONCE a couple of years back.  After Mark mentored me through that mess, I vowed to myself to stay current.  I don't ever want to experience that again!  LOL!  Yet......while it was my Current Initiative,  Mark's words "It can only get smaller" kept me both hopeful and motivated.  On occasion I might have to clean up a couple of past day's tasks that fell to the wayside for various reasons but that's hardly a backlog.  I aim to keep my vow to myself regarding backlog.  Implementing my version of DIT quite easily took care of that.<br>I'm always willing to give Mark's new ideas a try.  He has certainly improved my quality of life more than he could ever know.  Even though every idea hasn't worked with me, enough of them have to be always willing to at least give them a proper go!<br>learning as I go<br>p.s.

<div class="content">You know, the one thing that jumped out at me about this is how it seems that if we can't get through every page every day, then we're going to be looking at Page 1 more often than Page (last page), thereby ignoring Page (last page).  I guess I don't see the problem, however, with starting on Page 8 if we only get up through Page 7 the day before.

<div class="content">@Learning -- >>>"I'd rather choose another task that doesn't involve any type of flapping"......yet there are still items on the page so it doesn't get dismissed!<<<<br><br>Yes, that's pretty much it.  It just never stood out.  Other things did.<br><br>@Mark -- >>>How did it manage to stay on your AF list for over four months without being dismissed?<<<<br><br>Soon after making that entry, I came to that page several times, but a few other items always stood out.  Flapping arms never did.  So, I did the things that stood out, and moved on.<br><br>But then a good deal of April and May were spent focused on some very time-consuming projects.  I could spend several days focused on just one task -- not moving forward from my current page at all.   This tended to cause new incoming tasks to build up at the end of the list.  <br><br>And so, once I got free from that big pressing project, I suddenly had a large number of tasks that created something of a backlog.  Working through that backlog took a long time, especially as new tasks kept getting added to the list.  I could spend a week or two chasing my last page in that situation.<br><br>So, the last two times I saw that particular page was on 4/21 and then again on 5/5.  And then today.  <br><br>Generally this all worked out pretty well.  I spent most of my time either (A) focused on a very important project that really did require 95% of my attention for an extended period of time, or (B) working very close to the end of the list, staying current on tasks as they came in, knowing that I had stuff on my earlier pages that I hadn't seen in weeks, but also feeling quite comfortable that I wasn't missing anything urgent that might be hiding on those pages.  If anything really important was still on those earlier pages, I knew I'd get to them eventually.  <br><br>It does seem something of an anomaly that it occasionally might take me a month to get back to the beginning of the list.  But it still does seem to work pretty well.  The "flow" of Autofocus is still intact, especially when I'm in that mode of working toward the end of the list, staying current with whatever stands out.  I also still have great confidence in the system, and have the great feeling that it's helping me filter and focus on what's really important.   <br><br>And when there isn't the pressure of one of those top-priority deadlines that takes my full attention for a couple weeks, it generally takes just a few days to cycle back to the beginning of the list.<br><br><br>Mark -- does this all make sense?  Or do you think I'm missing some key idea?<br><br><br>>>>... or actioned? <<<  <br><br>Does that really need any explanation?  :-)</div>
