<div class="content">I'm looking to simplify my life and focus on what matters. I've read so much stuff on productivity and self development my head has gone crazy. I'm a VERY creative person, however I'm just not creating anything because I can't APPLY it. I care so much about getting it right. So i've been looking at what path and simple systems I need to use.<br><br>Looking at Autofocus my question is, I've come to the idea that what matters is what matters for me today, right now. So i've broken things down to the projects that need to be done first. But i'm not sure how to do this with the autofocus system.<br><br>This would give me a list of not that many things, should i just be putting everything in there? and do I break projects down or put the project as a whole? If i break it down, what if one step relies on completing another first, what is the point of having it on the list?<br><br>I'm most likely overthinking it, but this is where i get stuck with most systems!</div>

<div class="content">From a pragmatical point of view all that matters here is "How long will an item stay unfinished on a page?"<br><br>So write your projects lists with the steps of each project on your Autofocus pages, start to work on your items, and see how long each item stays unfinished on its page.<br><br>Then try to learn from what has happened.<br></div>

<div class="content">PS:<br>Then try to learn from what has happened.<br>"Since when is this item unfinished on this page?"<br>"Why is this item still not finished?"<br>"What am I doing about this?"<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">I'm just worried that it will become to overwhelming and i won't be getting stuff done. I'm an idea person. I have lots of ideas and things I want to do, if i put everything on it, I will be working a little on everything all at once and nothing will end up getting completed!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Smarky<br><br>Just try it - exactly according to the instructions.  It works intuitively rather than rationally so trying to work it out first doesn't work - just try it and I'm sure you'll find the answers to your questions will come naturally ...........</div>

<div class="content">Smarky:<br><br>I recommend you build your list organically, rather than try to put everything in at once. In other words, just start off by listing a few things that come to mind, start working on them and add tasks as they come to mind or come up.</div>
