<div class="content">I use the top-down/bottom-up method for managing work and home (so I treat a spread of two pages as a single work list, for example).<br><br>I found that drawing a line to separate unactioned blocks was getting lost amid 1) the line I draw to separate work from home and 2) the lines I draw through a task to signify its completion.<br><br>So I'm using my highlighter to draw a box around the unactioned task(s). Helps make it stand out a little more from my blue-inked tasks. If I wind up dismissing the task, then the same highlighter pen marks through the task.<br><br>I suppose I could just use a check mark by a task instead of marking through the whole line, so I may try that this week.</div>

<div class="content">I'm doing something similar to avoid any visual cross-clutter of an "on notice block" line with various other lines (strike-through of actions, line separating dates of item entry, ...).<br><br>I've decided to use a narrow highlighted section just to the left of the margin (touching it at the right edge) to mark "on notice tasks" - it's really easy to mark a block of multiple tasks by running the highlighter pen vertically along the margin, thus giving an easily-visible strip the width of the highlighter nib's height.<br><br>If an item ends up being dismissed, the mark disappears into the full-line highlight, and if it gets actioned then the strike-through (and vertical line if that technique is used) show up clearly against the highlight.<br><br>One minor side-benefit I like about AF2 vs AF1 (not that I was very good about sticking to AF1 - yet to see whether I'll do better with v2!) is that the highlighter is only needed once at the start of day, for dismissal and (with this approach) marking on notice items, and doesn't have to be carried around.<br><br>Anyway, back to the list...<br></div>
