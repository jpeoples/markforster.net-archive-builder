<div class="content">Turning away from angels on pins, links between cancer and Dutch Elm Disease, I'd like to know how resolutely some DWM devotees are adhering to the basic rules.<br><br>I've been on the manual/paper patch for quite a few weeks now.  In common with others, I have tried a few tweaks here and there.<br><br>Adherents of DWM have mostly stated that they follow the Day 7 and Day 28 (or Month) principle of having those as the ONLY points of entry for Re-Entered and New Tasks respectively.  These render all other 26 pages as Close Lists, verboten etc to add to, but open in terms of working through the lists from 1 to 28.<br><br>Ok, but if one has a burst on, say, pages 10 - 27 ( or even on the whole thing from 1 - 28) AND Day 7 is already pretty full, for whatever reason, then every started, but unfinished task will just add to the load of Day 7.<br><br>I endorse the view that one has to be practical and that urgent and critical tasks should take  precedence, but why not re-enter unfinished tasks on +7 from the page they are already on if the task was on a page 8 to 21?<br><br>Has anyone successfuly (in thier own view) departed from ONLY Day 7 as a Re-entry point, maybe by entering on a "closed" page with very few items already on it?<br><br>Any takers or am I being more of a DWM heretic than a DWM maverick ?</div>

<div class="content">Roger,<br><br>What do you mean by "the load of Day 7"? The entire list is the load of right now, isn't it?<br><br>If you believe you are truly committed to more work than you can do in a week, you may need a scheduling solution.</div>

<div class="content">But it would be a mistake to include the scheduling in DWM itself. Perhaps deal with some tasks by dropping them into a tickler for future consideration?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Will, This bloke's not for burning ;-))))))<br><br>Yes, I do know the whole list is the focus, but it's just a thought that a creative burst of tasks to do can fill up 7 and 28, but not always.<br><br>I try to avoid scheduling within DWM, not always easy in a "date" system that is really a series of closed lists, but I'm generally succeeding on that score,<br><br>I am starting to use a special mark when I spot an item which I don;t want to do now, but know that I have to do before the day is done.  I still preface all entered tasks with a horizontal dash, add avertical one and cross out done stuff, wavy line through dismissed or discarded tasks, and a double dash (like =) for the ones that I relaise should be done today.<br><br>I ain't giving up on DWM.<br><br>R</div>

<div class="content">I have 46 lines available to me for any given day.  I have OCCASIONALLY filled all of those and when I have I've snuck tasks in on the right side of the shorter lines.<br><br>I think that to start messing with relative W and relative M is to defeat the power of DWM, which is to force movement on tasks within a reasonable timeframe and then keep them moving forward.  If you had a creative burst, great, but are you really going to work on all of those things within the next month?  Or would they be better put in a tickler/calendar?  I do use my list as a dump, and acting on a task CAN BE realizing that it's not reasonable to think I'm going to do it in the next month and transferring it to the calendar.<br><br>(I confess that I do occasionally bypass my calendar reminders and enter tasks more than a month out - for example, I have a bunch of stuff that can't be started 'til the academic semester is over already written on pages dated mid-June - but the *active* list is capped at page M.)</div>

<div class="content">I honestly don't understand how one can keep up with the full DWM system (flipping through 28 to 31 pages). I've been very happy with my modified (paper Field Notes) WM system, using 5 double-pages with four columns for each week. This mod was originally suggested by Alan B. It works great.</div>

<div class="content">People keep registering this objection - the flipping of the pages - and it just doesn't make sense to me.  Does it REALLY take that much effort to turn a page?  I mean, presumably the number of entries is going to be the same no matter which AF/DWM type system you're using.  You can (and I do) use paperclips to bunch pages that have no open tasks on them.</div>

<div class="content">I agree with you Sarah, I didn't mind flipping through all the pages. <br><br>It's funny, the notebook I was using befor last week, rarely had tasks beyond the middle of the page. It was easy enough going through the book to see if the top of page had tasks or not. Because it felt like a waste  to have so much of the book blank, I just switched to a notebook using 2 pages per week (divided in 7 sections so I still had the D - W - M). <br><br>On one hand, it's 'easier' because it's only 4 pages instead of 28 (really 14 pages, since front/back of a page are 2 dates).<br><br>On the other hand, it's (fractionally) slower because I can't just check the top of the page, I have to look at the entire page. Granted, I doubt that means even a 2 second check per page (longer if there's open items) but it's a change from checking just the top of the page for tasks. <br><br>I haven't decided if it's just a 'learning curve' thing and in another few days it won't be noticeable anymore or not. If it is, I'll probably move back to a larger notebook at some point.</div>

<div class="content">Sarah,<br><br>Regarding my objection to "the flipping of the pages," I did try the canonical DWM method for a while, and had many pages with very few items on each. I think this type of system *requires* that one cycle through all the active pages at least a couple times per day, and I found it cumbersome with so many mostly-empty pages. My modified two-facing-pages-per-week system is great - I quickly glance at each of the five double-pages, and find that I can keep a mental map of what is where throughout the day. It's so clear that I often just jump directly to the next task that "stands out" without having to cycle through each item on each page.<br><br>I do augment the system in one other way: each morning, I pick out three items that I really want to get done, and put a little circle to the left of each one, then copy those three to an index card labeled with today's date. This way, I know I'm getting a few important (or about-to-expire) tasks done each day.</div>
