<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>For the past few weeks I have been trying many tweaks and revisions of DWM2 (my own ideas and others), AF4 (AF4+3TS), AF1 (SuperFocus), and others (Gerry's TTS), but they couldn't give me the control I needed for the different tasks at hand.  <br><br>It was Sarah's comment,<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1305619/#item1308450" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1305619/#item1308450</a><br><br>that gave me pause.  Looking back, the most productive that I had ever been was when I first used DWM2 as I had first interpreted it, <br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2010/10/26/my-favourite-time-management-system.html/#item10309909" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2010/10/26/my-favourite-time-management-system.html/#item10309909</a> & <a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2010/10/26/my-favourite-time-management-system.html/#item10314647" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2010/10/26/my-favourite-time-management-system.html/#item10314647</a><br><br>So I went back to it since a couple of days ago, and well...I am at peace.  I went to being very productive, no stress, no doubts (well, maybe not "no stress and doubts" entirely, but...you know what I mean ^___^).  The only tweak I added was to use another mark for recurring tasks so that they are easier to find, but, as I had originally conceived it, I wouldn't treat them as "re-entered" tasks (tasks that expire in 7 days).<br><br>I have some inklings on why the other time management systems did not work for me while for others they did work very well, but not very clearly.  I am sure however it was due to some personality quirks of mine<br><br>So for now, Mark and others, I am going to stop trying other TMS's and focus on what's really working for me.  I will still try to give ideas and such, but I'll leave the test driving to you guys ^___^<br><br>Now I have to think how to do my projects.  Hmmm....<br><br>Thanks to all of your ideas and support, people, and God bless us all!</div>

<div class="content">Nuntym,<br><br>Congratulations, I think this illustrates that we should all be using time management system that suit us and sometimes this means picking one that fits how we work and our own tendencies.  There is no one size fits all.  <br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">Nuntym,<br><br>does this mean that you dismiss<br>each task that is older than one month and hasn't been worked on<br>and <br>each re-entered task that is older than one week<br>?</div>

<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>Thanks, Gerry ^___^<br><br>-----<br><br>Rainer,<br><br>Yes, that's exactly how it is.  However, I am using Mark's terminology with my own peculiar initial misunderstanding of the rules that ironically was very successful in my use.  Per DWM's rules, all "new" tasks are entered into the system to be dismissed after 30 days when not actioned by then, and all "re-entered" tasks into the system are deleted after one week of non-action.  Here is the original blog post that detailed the rules of DWM:<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2010/2/1/dit2-af5-who-cares-what-its-called-this-is-what-im-working-o.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2010/2/1/dit2-af5-who-cares-what-its-called-this-is-what-im-working-o.html</a><br><br>However, I treat finished recurrent tasks (tasks that you finish then have to do the same work after a period of time, eg. cleaning) as "new" tasks, not "re-entered" tasks.  Only unfinished tasks are treated as "re-entered" tasks.  This wasn't how Mark originally thought of it, and I got into it because of a misunderstanding of the rules, but, as I have said, it is working really well for me.<br><br>-----<br><br>God bless!</div>

<div class="content">I wish I could describe myself as "at peace," but that is not an accurate description of my typical state of mind. But I am sufficiently at peace that I haven't been the slightest tempted to try any of these new systems. If, a year later, I still read about people raving how these new systems are life transforming, I will consider trying them. For now, like nuntym, I am sticking with DWM.</div>

<div class="content">My life is being transformed, and my system is one essential element of that transformation.  (The grace of God, necessity/desire, hard work, and good people are some other essential elements.)</div>

<div class="content">Nuntym,<br><br>I don't think your version is a misunderstanding or a deviation from Mark's rules. From the instructions that you linked to:<br><br>"If at any time you commit yourself to a task by taking some action on it, you are put under increased pressure to get it finished by being given only seven calendar days to do some more work on it. Of course many tasks are done in one go, so can be deleted without being re-entered."<br><br>The key words here are "get it finished."  I think Mark would agree that tasks that recur but are not left unfinished (such as doing the laundry, paying bills) are not tasks that need to "get finished" and thus would be entered where the new tasks go. Also, in the instructions for SuperFocus he says that taking the next complete step on a project (such as reading Chapter 2 of War and Peace) counts as a new task, not a re-entered one. Of course, if you only wrote down "Read War and Peace," then it will be unfinished until it's done. But tasks that you complete periodically are quite different.</div>

<div class="content">I agree with George about recurring tasks. Count each stage as done and enter it as a new task.<br><br>My family (like most) generates laundry constantly. Some days there almost none, some days there is a lot. I only run full loads to save energy, so even when I do all I can, there's still half-a-load to be done.<br><br>Morning laundry is considered done when all the dry laundry (if any) is away and the first load (if any) in the washer. At that point, there's nothing I can do until the machine finishes, so I mark "Monday morning laundry" as done.<br><br>During the day I often move it between machines (I can do 4 loads in a day if I have to). That takes five minutes between other tasks. Clean laundry stays in the laundry room until tomorrow.<br><br>Evening routine includes putting wet clothes, if any, in the dyer, so they don't stay wet overnight.<br><br>So laundry is considered done "for the day" early in the morning, even though by noon there's another clean pile to put away, a load that has to be moved to the dryer sometime before bed, and dirty laundry in the basket.</div>

<div class="content">The reasons that in the rules as I wrote them recurrent tasks were always re-entered at the 7 day point is that once you have taken some action on them they have been accepted as being part of your life.<br><br>Tasks at the 30-day point are not yet accepted. - they are simply there for consideration.<br><br>In Cricket's example laundry is part of her life and therefore should go in at the 7 day point. It's not as if she's having to make a decision every time she does the laundry as to whether it's part of her life or not.<br><br> On the other hand if she does finally get fed up with doing the laundry all she has to do is leave it for 7 days and it will vanish off the list!</div>

My main monthly recurring task are going to bank to pay a loan on the 28th (or so) and paying bills online on the 4th (or so).</div>

<div class="content">sabre:<br><br>I wouldn't put either weekly or monthly recurring tasks directly into DWM. Instead I'd put them into some sort of reminder system, so that they could be entered in the system when they fell due. <br><br>The reason for this is that if you put a weekly tasks in at the 7 day point and a monthly task at the 30 day point, there would only be one day on which they could be done before being dismissed.</div>

<div class="content">If I do laundry on day 0, do I cross it off day 7, and enter tomorrow's laundry on day 8? DWM is good for things I haven't decided about or which have no external deadline (DWM2 is very similar to AF except for dismissal rules), but I don't like it for things with deadlines.<br><br>>> On the other hand if she does finally get fed up with doing the laundry all she has to do is leave it for 7 days and it will vanish off the list! <br><br>Will it also vanish from my life?</div>

<div class="content"><< if you put a weekly tasks in at the 7 day point and a monthly task at the 30 day point, there would only be one day on which they could be done before being dismissed >><br><br>The weekly tasks I put into DWM are the "soft" recurring ones, they can be done some days earlier or later. Similarly, the soft recurring monthly tasks. <br><br>For example, my "(m) Bills online (4dec10)" is now on expiring 9dec10 page, since I actually did the previous month bills on 11nov (11th is the latest I do it usually). Oops, I just noticed I had left my DWM.xls month entry days to be 28 (just changed it to 31). I like being reminded on recurring tasks in DWM.<br><br>I recently started adding "(d)", "(w)", "(m)" tags to the start of my soft recurring tasks. Oh this "(d) Mark Forster AF DWM forum" is of course a daily recurring task. ;-)<br><br>I hate putting soft recurring tasks in my calendar, since I tend not to do it on the day I set it, and then have to move the task multiple times. I leave my calendar for hard recurring tasks, such as the regular monthly first Friday meeting with my boss.</div>

<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>Thanks George, Cricket!<br><br>So Mark, how did it go?<br><br>And Sabre23t, well...that sounds complicated, and like Mark said it gives you little time to work on your weekly/monthly recurrent tasks.  I am just trying to simplify DWM2 in my use as it is, and for me it has achieved the perfect blend of simplicity, comprehensibility, autonomy and flexibility.<br><br>God bless!</div>

Sometime I do have to reenter it, for example when I only half-completed the bills for the month.<br><br>I decided to tag (d), (w), (m) tasks so I don't have to continually decide/remember whether a recurring task is d/w/m. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br><<Not too complicated for me, since DWM.xls makes Re-entry or Entry easy. ;-)>><br><br>Sabre23t, <br><br>Well, actually re-entering items in DWM2 is also quite easy, as it is always at the end of the list.  What I mean is the decision making whether it should be monthly or weekly.<br><br>I know, I know, that sounds kinda lazy, but I think I already trained my mind into seeing only two kinds of items: unfinished or new tasks.  If the item is recurrent, no matter if it is hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly, I always treat it as a new item.  If it is unfinished, I always treat it as re-entered.  Makes it really simple for me ^___^<br><br>God bless!</div>
