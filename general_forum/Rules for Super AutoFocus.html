<div class="content">Normal AF1 rules, except:<br><br>1. There is a second column on each page which is used for:<br>	a. Re-entries of unfinished tasks;<br>	b. Tasks not already on the page which you wish to do now. (Note 1)<br><br>2. The 2nd column is treated as part of the page for all purposes, including dismissal.<br><br>3. If there is insufficient room in the 2nd column for more tasks, then any further tasks for it are entered in the 2nd column of the next available page. (Note 2)<br><br>4. If a task in the 2nd column is the only task ready to be done, it should be crossed out and moved to the 2nd column of the next available page (Note 3). If no other tasks have been done on the current visit to the page, then all other tasks should be dismissed including any remaining in the 2nd column. (Note 4)<br><br>Notes:<br><br>1) This is intended to be used for anything you want to do now, not just urgent tasks.<br><br>2) This imposes a limit on how long new material can be added to a page.<br><br>3) The effect of this is to allow one task to continue to be worked on for more than one page.<br><br>4) This prevents the addition of a task to a page solely in order to avoid the page being dismissed. Rule 4 as a whole also prevents a task being worked on twice running without another task intervening.</div>

<div class="content">My own view after only a couple of days working with this system is that it is streets ahead of any of my other systems. It has amazing flexibility and still has the flow of AF1. <br><br>I'll be interested to know what everyone else makes of it.</div>

<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>A clarification please, Mark: so if I thought of an item to add to the AF1 that I feel can be done later, it goes to the end of the AF1 list, but if it is quite urgent, I add it to the right side column of the page I am working now, right?<br><br>God bless!</div>

<div class="content">Rule 4 is slightly confusing, but I think I get it.<br><br>Seems to me generally  you turn to a page, work on stuff on the left, and it gets sent to the right, but you can only work so long before the page is full and you have to move on.  <br><br>Then over time you have several full pages, and you'll be picking things from older pages and writing them each out to later pages.  That part in practice is much like I'm doing, except without restricting work exclusively to the right side of the page.  (and with AF1 type dismissal rules)</div>

I'm sure I will in future.<br><br><< except without restricting work exclusively to the right side of the page. >><br><br>My experience so far is that most work gets done on the 1st Column. Typically only a small proportion of tasks get sent to the 2nd Column. <br><br>The ability to add any task to the 2nd Column that one wishes to do now gives immense flexibility. For instance I'm writing these comments under a task which I wrote just now in the 2nd Column. I don't have to wait until it comes up in a few pages' time.</div>

<div class="content">Very interesting. So far I am so digging the 3t method with AF4, I'm not sure I will try this any time, soon, but seems like an elegant way to utilize the AF1 protocol while still having important items bubble to the top.<br><br>Hope my not using this does not make me streets behind! :)</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>Thanks for posting the rules even though you are still experimenting.<br><br>You wrote: "1. There is a second column on each page which is used for: a. Re-entries of unfinished tasks; b. Tasks not already on the page which you wish to do now. (Note 1: This is intended to be used for anything you want to do now, not just urgent tasks.)"<br><br>I have two questions about this Rule 1.  <br><br>1. If you work a bit on something, and are satisfied with your progress even though the task is technically not finished, do you always re-enter on the right column of the same page, or sometimes at the end of the AF1 list (left column)?<br><br>2. I would imagine that an urgent or irresistible task added to the right column may already exist on another page. When this is the case, do you scan the entire list to cross out the previous entry, in order to avoid duplication?</div>

<div class="content">I'm trying to understand Rule 4:<br><br><<<4. If a task in the 2nd column is the only task ready to be done, it should be crossed out and moved to the 2nd column of the next available page (Note 3). If no other tasks have been done on the current visit to the page, then all other tasks should be dismissed including any remaining in the 2nd column. (Note 4)>>><br><br>Here is my attempt at re-writing it in my own words:<br><br>If a task in the 2nd column "stands out", you should work on it for as long as you want.  You then cross it out and move it to the 2nd column of the next available page.  If that was the first task that you did on the current visit to the page, then all other tasks on that page should be dismissed (both 1st and 2nd columns).<br><br><br>Is this correct?<br><br>If yes, it seems it would impel you to always work on something in the 1st column -- that is, start something new, or work on a recurring task -- before allowing you to do any work on an unfinished task.  <br><br>That doesn't seem right, so I am wondering what exactly you meant by "the only task ready to be done".</div>

<div class="content">@Vegheadjones: seems having the same surname has placed you and me in the same camp for now!  I'm waiting for a few more days of feedback and comment from Mark and the active Forum guys and dolls before considering trialling this new approach.  For now I'll stick with AF4.3T, as customised by me (nothing major, still adheres to the AF4 and 3T approach)<br><br>Last night I printed out the AF1 rules to refresh my knowledge,  Like others, I found Rule 4 a bit confusing.<br><br>However, logging onto the Forum early this sunny morning in Damascus, I'm pleased to find nearly all my queries have been asked by members and replied to by Mark.  Still not enough yet to entice me to move, but sufficient to keep an eye on this thread.<br><br>One thought that did enter my deliberations is that the second column could act as the location for the Three Tasks (including those in the first column selected as one or more of the current Thre)e.  But maybe this would keep one too long on a single page if one kept on adding another two tasks per the Three Tasks Rule.<br><br>Cosmetics/application: I favour Moleskine Large/A5 as my AF notebook, the second column on a page reduces the amount of space to describe the task.  My handwriting habit of many years is to print the task and this takes up most of the 5 inches on the page width.<br>So I would probably move from writing each NEW task on the RH page to the LH page and use the RH page as the second column IF I decide to try Super AF.<br><br>In the meantime, I will wait and watch.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br><< I'm trying to understand Rule 4 >><br><br>I'm sorry it's difficult to understand. Writing clear rules is surprisingly difficult. <br><br>Basically Column 2 is just an extension to the page it is on. It is a way of putting more tasks onto a page that is already full. <br><br>It is particularly useful when you have an unfinished task. Instead of having to re-enter it at the end of the list, which may be a long way off, you can put it back on the same page so that it comes round again very quickly.<br><br>A problem however occurs when all the other tasks on the page have either been completed or you have done as much work as you want to on them for the time being. In that case the unfinished task is the only one available to work on and you can't alternate it with any other task.<br><br>This is where Rule 4 comes in. In this situation you can move the unfinished task to the next page instead of to the end of the list. There it can alternate with some fresh tasks without losing momentum.<br><br>It's possible with a really big task that it may continue moving round the list for some considerable time.<br><br>The final bit of Rule 4 is for the situation when you move the task to the next page as above, but when you get there you find none of the tasks already on that page are standing out. In that case the page would have been dismissed anyway, so that is what you do.<br><br>Hope that's clearer!</div>

<div class="content">How would you adapt an existing AF list where the pages are already full?  Does it work okay with several full pages at the start, and follow the Super rules (especially 3) for continued work?</div>

<div class="content">Alan:<br><br>I think it would cause a problem if there wasn't room for a second column. You might be able to do a work around by using a separate sheet of paper, but my instinct would be to start a new list (which is what I did).</div>

<div class="meta">2010-11-13 17:35</div>
<div class="content">Thanks, Mark, for the further explanation. I think I understand much better what Rules 3 and 4 are about. There always has to be more than one workable task on a page, since each page combines the old tasks and the re-entered tasks. And Rule 4 is applied when when you add an unfinished task to the next page and then start working on the next page; the re-entered task doesn't prevent what would otherwise have been a dismissal of the items on the next page.<br><br>And thanks to Roger J for suggesting the solution to the dilemma of how to fit the tasks into a half-page instead of a full one: make the left hand page be the first column, and the right-hand page be the second column, so that both pages together = one "page." I can now try this new system using the notebooks I already have.<br><br>Mark, at the end of an earlier blog post (I think it's the one called My Favourite Time Management System) you said that you would write more about AF1 and why it seems to work better than AF4 or DWM. I hope you will do so. I'm guessing that the smaller size of the closed lists in AF1 (based on the size of the page) makes them easier to deal with than the larger closed list of AF4. But with the addition of the second column, does that affect the ideal page size? In the original instructions, you suggested a page size of 25-35 lines, and now it could be in the range of 50-70. Does that make a difference for you in the effect of a smaller closed list?</div>

It's also amply wide enough for two columns unless your handwriting is huge or you write very long descriptions of tasks. <br><br>The 2nd column doesn't seem to really affect the recommended length of a page - it's very rare to actually fill it and it tends to consist of a few tasks repeated over and over again.</div>

<div class="meta">2010-11-13 22:42</div>
<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>Thanks for the explanation of Rule #4!   I think I understand it better now.   I'll try it in my own words again to see if I got it:<br><br>(1) If you are working on a task, and then decide to stop, and the task is unfinished, you then write the task at the end of Column 2.  You then cycle through all the tasks on the page (both columns 1 and 2), looking for something to "stand out".  If you cycle through both columns, and nothing stands out, and then you arrive at the task you just wrote at the end of Column 2, you should cross off that task, move to the next page, and add that task to the end of Column 2 on that page (carrying along this task with you as you go forward through the AF book).  <br><br>(2) Then, following the AF rules, you quickly read through all the tasks on the new page (both columns) to refresh your memory on what's there.  You then start reading through them more slowly, looking for one to stand out.  If you go through all of them, and nothing stands out, and finally arrive at the task you just entered at the end of Column 2, then you should cross out the task you had just entered at the end of Column 2, dismiss everything on that page, move to the next page, and write that task again at the end of Column 2 on that page.  Then repeat this process (2).<br><br><br>The effect is that you can carry forward one task along with you from one page to the next as you work through the AF book.  This enables you to keep momentum on some particular task that keeps grabbing your attention, while still working through the whole AF book and taking care of whatever else also stands out.  These particular rules also ensure that this carrying-forward doesn't interfere with the AF dismissal function.<br><br><br>Is that an accurate summary?</div>
<h2>Reply by Seraphim</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-11-13 23:04</div>
<div class="content">Can you carry forward more than 1 item?<br><br>For example, let's say I have a few Column 2 tasks that I keep repeating because I can't finish them:<br><br>- Call the President (haven't been able to get through)<br>- Check the soup on the stove - done yet?<br>- Move the hose (watering the lawn)<br>- Check the baseball score<br>- Has that package arrived yet?<br><br><br>And I want to keep these going while I cycle through my whole AF book.  It would be kinda problematic to let any one of them drop while I am off doing AF.<br><br>I suppose I could write those three tasks on a separate index card, and then write "Check Index Card" in Column 2.   Then keep carrying that task forward, until finally those tasks are all done.<br><br>But I don't like carrying separate index cards.  So why not just carry forward all those tasks?<br><br>Maybe the rule should be "if nothing stands out except the Column 2 stuff you want to carry forward, then move all those tasks forward, and start working the next page".<br><br>Do you think that would work?</div>

<div class="meta">2010-11-14 1:57</div>
<div class="content">My opinion Seraphim: I think it would work.  I also think it changes things a bit.  Mark's original concept was to get things finished and closed off, and move on when only one thing is left (only because it's no good doing just one thing :-).</div>

Another example: there are a number of tasks in column two but only one is ready to be done.<br><br>It's difficult to describe in words,  but if you try it out you will see why the rule is needed.

If there's more than one such task, you can fight it out between them on the page you are currently on.<br><br>However the examples you give would all count as urgent tasks, so you could enter them on the new page as such.</div>

It was something I tried out before developing SAF. I didn't like it at all. It destroyed the flow of AF1 without giving any advantages over using 3-T with AF4. If you want to use 3-T then my recommendation is to use it either with AF4 or on its own.</div>
