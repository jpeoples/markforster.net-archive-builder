<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">I have been an ardent fan of using a long list as my to do list - either I proces it by using AF or FV or FVP didn't matter. ( <a href="http://sathyawrites.com/productivity-planners/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://sathyawrites.com/productivity-planners/</a> )<br>However I found one intriguing problem about working on a task list that mixes both my work tasks, personal tasks, other project tasks. I tried using Peter Bergman's 6 boxes system, but it was little too complicated for me. <br>Using two separate pages/ even notebooks for my personal and work tasks didnt work for me. I wanted both the lists to be on the same page, but separately. <br>I found this system below and it seems to work nicely.<br>Becky's List-making Method: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7idUFAb0_o" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7idUFAb0_o</a><br>It basically has two lists one starting from top to down, while another from bottom to top. Based on the time, context I decide which task list to screen and engage with. <br>It's a simple idea, but I hope also to get more such inspiration to create such master lists.</div>

<div class="content">This method has been around on this list since at least 2009. Search for stalagmite/stalagtite method.<br><br>Glad to hear it's still being used successfully!</div>
