<div class="content">Some interesting statistics from a study cited in the ebook:<br><br>41% of to-do items were never completed<br>50% of completed to-do items are done within a day<br>18% of completed to-do items are done within an hour<br>10% of completed to-do items are done within a minute<br>15% of dones started as to-do items<br><br>That last one is especially striking.   It means that 85% of the stuff people got done was NOT previously captured on any kind of to-do list... which calls into the question the overall value / impact of the to-do list compared to the other tools and habits that we employ (consciously or not) to get our work done (e.g., meetings, routines, daily structure, workspace organization and structure, team interaction dynamics, etc.)</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for posting this. I've been meaning to look this one up.<br><br>I've experimented with some "done list" type ideas of my own in the past, including the "What's Better?" list from "How to Make Your Dreams Come True". I'll be interested to see how their ideas differ from mine.</div>

<div class="content">Read through this.  Interesting ideas here - it was enough to convince me to go with a Done List of my own for a while.  I've tested "gratitude journals" and Mark's What's Better list before and have felt good when using them, but since I always compiled those in one batch task for each day, it didn't take long for me to fall off.  But I can update the Done List as I complete tasks, which sounds like it'll stick with me more.  We'll see how it works out.</div>

<div class="content">The iDoneThis ebook and site took me to an article on multitasking by layering tasks, as well as an appreciation for how SMEMA creates progress through small wins.<br><br>I commented here:<br><br>Layered SMEMA<br><a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2318550#post2326062" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2318550#post2326062</a></div>
