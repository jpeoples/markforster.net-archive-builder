<div class="content">I frequently log my time. It's counter-intuitive, but the days I spend 30-120 minutes logging and organizing my notes are the days I get more real work done. <br><br>Simply logging my hours in a notebook is good, but entering the data into the latest and greatest database or spreadsheet layout, and seeing my daily totals and progress on monthly goals, is even more effective.<br><br>Maybe it's because I'm excited about playing with the new record system, and want something to enter.</div>
