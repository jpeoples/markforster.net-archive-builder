<div class="content">7. If you go to a page and no item stands out for you on your first pass through it, then all the outstanding items on that page are dismissed without re-entering them. (N.B. This does not apply to the final page, on which you are still writing items). Use a highlighter to mark dismissed items.<br><br>- If I arrive at the final page then go back to the first is it considered a first pass through the first page? (does point 7 apply in that case?)<br><br>- What does dismiss mean in this context? I highlight them and they remain there to be passed again or should I re-enter them after splitting them in smaller tasks or should I do them?<br>- What happens with the items after they are dismissed? Will they be reviewed at a later date? Do they go to a backlog?<br><br>I don't understand the meaning of the phrase: "This is where the system finally gets rid of all the items which you entered without evaluation, but which the system has sifted and found wanting.".<br>- "entered without evaluation" means I shouldn't have entered them or I should've split them further?<br>- "the system found them wanting" meaning the system highlights what needs to be done or does it have another meaning?<br><br>All in all I think I need an example or two for point 7 and I think the system should come with an example on the first mail for beta testers.<br><br>Thanks in advance, Bogdan.</div>

<div class="content">Bogdan<br><br>"If you go to a page and no item stands out..."   Mostly this would mean if you go forward to a page but in the case of the first page, it means when you go back to the first page.  Mark has coverd both cases by simply saying , "If you go to a page..."  So it seems your understanding of this part is correct.<br><br>"Dismiss":  This simply means you effectively remove them from the list.  It is a firm rule not to re-enter these items (at least for some time to come).  The rephrasing only applies if, after some time, there are fresh impulses to return to them and give them another go and put them back on the list.<br><br>"Entered without evaluation".  This means that when an item was first entered it was simply because it "occurred to you".  You did not censor the idea.  You did not commit yourself to doing anything about it.  You did not know exactly where it might lead.  It was just put down because you felt there might be something in it for you.  <br><br>"The system found them wanting".  This means exactly the opposite of what you appear to think it means.  It means the item lacked any drawing power for you.  After repeated passes you still do not feel prompted to do anything about them.  The system has finally assurred you that you can safely conclude that they have no relevance for your life at this point.<br><br>An example:  "Give $1000 to the Red Cross".  If you were to find that you are not moved to act on this after 10 or more passes during a week of you life, get rid of the item.  You are not ready to do it after all.  <br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Bogdan<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/627319" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/627319</a><br><br>The above links leads to some FAQ's which may help with some of your questions. I would suggest using the system for a while first, as it can be more confusing to read questions without having worked with the system first.<br><br>I need to update that post as there have been several  helpful posts started subsequently and it is on my list ........ :-)  If anyone finds any threads particularly helpful and would be willing to add a link to the FAQ thread that would be great!<br></div>
