<div class="content">Hi folks. Glad to see people are deconstructing and building new ways to stay focused, and get important things done. <br><br>I'm a bit of a fan-boy for Barbara Sher's Wishcraft process, and thoroughly enjoyed her latest (and free) offering; <br><br><a href="http://barbarasclub.com/how-to-get-what-you-really-want/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://barbarasclub.com/how-to-get-what-you-really-want/</a></div>

<div class="content">Doesn't take long to read either!<br><br>I'd say it was pretty good advice.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for good tip, avrum, I will check it. I am also big fan of her books. Especially Refuse to choose...</div>

<div class="content">Success teams seem to be the theme of the day. This booklet, a podcast on leadership, and a writing post. Not all by that name, but similar idea. Tempting, but the timing is wrong for me.</div>

<div class="content">I really liked her book I Could Do Anything If I Only Knew What It Was. I really identified with it. The main takeaway I got from it was that some people like to come up with ideas but not just work on them until they are done, but that is probably OK. Like if I wanted to I could just start a notebook of ideas and even if I didn't do them it would still be fun. Another one was the same idea, but just about learning about new things for a while before moving onto the next thing. I will have to look at her other books like Wishcraft.</div>

<div class="content">That sounds like me. I enjoy dreaming up things I want to do and researching and doing proof-of-concept. Then I push it further and end up with too many unfinished projects.</div>

<div class="content">She's also describing what Napoleon Hill called mastermind groups. A few of us at work formed a mastermind a few months ago and it really is a positive thing. I need the accountability so it's very helpful for me.</div>

<div class="content"><<mastermind groups>><br><br>Reflecting on past accomplishments, I can (almost) always point to a group of people nudging, nagging or supporting my success. <br><br>An example: <br>A guitarist in one of my bands was infamous for booking gigs without discussing it with any of us. Our natural reaction would be: "Are you friggin crazy!!??? You didn't tell us! We're not ready. The songs aren't done. Blah, blah..." Of course, the pressure made every practice golden, helping the songs, and ultimately our musical careers. <br><br>When I'm doing things on my own, i rarely ship (Seth Godin has a lot to say about shipping). Without group support, I remain adrift in a sea of to-do lists, and productivity systems. It's delusional thinking, but like alcohol, it numbs the emotional pain of not doing meaningful stuff.</div>

<div class="content">avrum:<br><br><< I remain adrift in a sea of to-do lists, and productivity systems. >><br><br>Have you tried sticking with one system and making it work? <br><br>Changing systems all the time is a sure recipe for none of them working. Almost any system is better if you stick to it.</div>

<div class="content">avrum:<br>A suggestion. Write out answers to 2 questions:<br><br>1. why are you even considering doing anything at all about time management?<br><br>2. imagine you had a form of time management you were happy with and it was working for you. what would you notice as different, either in yourself or in your living?</div>

<div class="content">Michael/Mark:<br><br>Actually, I've been using a variation of Peter Bregman's (18 Mintues) system with some success. However Barbara's e-book highlighted certain factors that I'd like to address.</div>

<div class="content">A correction to my previous post: I think the book I read was Refuse to Choose, which as you can tell by the title, sounds a lot more like what I was talking about.</div>
