<div class="content">Does Fujitsu make a S300 Scan Snap scanner (or something comparable) that is Windows Vista or 7 compatible?</div>

<div class="content">I think the M1500 will do what you want.</div>

<div class="content">I have a S300 and used it successfully with Win 7. I first installed the software from the disc and then the Vista Update Pack from here: <a href="http://www.fujitsu.com/us/services/computing/peripherals/scanners/support/downloads.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fujitsu.com/us/services/computing/peripherals/scanners/support/downloads.html</a></div>

<div class="content">... and I see just now that they have a official Win 7 Update Pack out. Nice. It worked pretty well with the Vista one, though.</div>

<div class="content">I want a scanner  that is compatible  with my computers (running Windows XP, Vista, and 7).<br><br>Is this the scanner that I need:<br><br>Fujitsu ScanSnap S300 - Document scanner - Duplex - Legal - 600 dpi x 600 dpi - up to 8 ppm (mono) / up to 8 ppm (color) - ADF ( 10 sheets ) - Hi-Speed USB <br><br>It is on sale at Amazon for $479.</div>

<div class="content">Mark T:<br><br>As I told you, the S300 is the scanner I have and it works for me in XP and 7. If you follow the link I provided, you'll see Fujitsu has drivers for Vista and 7 for their models S300, S500, S510 and S1500 (XP drivers are included with the scanners). So I figure they'll all work with all three systems.</div>

<div class="content">Well, one tiny step to converting me.<br><br>At two meetings in a row, I needed a copy of something that went home with someone else. Turns out my cheapish cell phone's camera is better quality than a fax. Always with me. Handles larger pages. Don't have to break the spine. Sends straight to EverNote.<br><br>Very happy with it for those purposes.<br><br>Not nearly as nice as paper for taking my own notes, or scribbling extra checklists when one tiny line explodes (tell teacher, and Treasurer, and update summaries for executive) or when my computer screen gets crowded, but that doesn't prevent it from being wonderful in other cases. If I really need a paper copy, I can always print one at home.</div>
