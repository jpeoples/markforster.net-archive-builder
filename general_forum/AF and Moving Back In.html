<div class="content">I was in the beta testing of AF and decided to use it for our major remodeling project. We completely remodeled our twenty-year-old home. We lived in it during the remodel and it took four months. My use of AF was only for the remodel as I was home (retired) and dealt daily with the project supervisor and sub-contractors. I didn't exactly follow the rules but it worked extremely well for me. I had everything in one place, all the information I needed. It was a great improvement over my old to-do list and post-its stuck all over the place.<br><br>Now we are moving back in so to speak. The garage is full of boxes, some labeled and some not, and the major rooms have lots of boxes, too. We built in a lot of storage in almost all the rooms so there are places for things to go.  However we don't want all the old stuff put back into our home. It needs to be sorted and my husband wants both of us to do some areas together. I look around at our beautiful "new" home and feel overwhelmed. Boxes everywhere and each room seems to call to me. It all seems urgent and important - kitchen things needed to get back into normal cooking, office things needed for me and my husband (briings home work), clothes and things back into closets. It may be obvious to others of what to do but not to me.<br><br>The reason AF worked for me during the remodeling was everything was in one place, most everything got crossed off as I put on the list only those things that needed to be dealt with either now or in the very near future. The other types ot things were dismissed but they are still in my book. AF allowed me to enter items, act on the immediate (painter showed me the paint color on the actual wall he wanted to paint right then based upon the color we had previously chosen) and to think about future decisions (which rooms do we want wall-papered). I cycled through the pages several times a day which kept me sane as I felt I was on top of everything..<br><br>I have never been good at a regular to-do list and have basically been pretty unorganized since I retired which explains al lot of the boxes with no labels! My job had very little discretionary time - Emergency Room nurse.. My husband uses a to-do list and actually does it and doesn't understand why don't I "just do it".<br><br>Any suggestions would be welcome as my stress level is increasing daily.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Paige<br><br>I can really relate to your comment "My husband uses a to-do list and actually does it and doesn't understand why don't I "just do it"  Anyone who is able to just get stuff done has no idea how hard some of us struggle with something which, on the face of it, seems so easy and logical.<br><br>Reading your post it sounds as if you separated your remodelling tasks from your other tasks (by means of dismissing everything else) but that you also restricted what you put into AF.  AF works best if you add absolutely everything into it, but, in the situation you are in now, my recommendation would be to have two AF lists, one for "moving back in" and one for everything else.  Given your current stress levels I would suggest just starting with your "moving back in" notebook and write everything related into that book, regardless of room, type of task, level of detail - just put everything in.  Once you have done that you will automaticaly start to relax and to think more clearly.  It sounds as if you already have the application of the system working well, in that you are used to cycling through the pages several times a day, so you should find this to work well.<br><br>I would also recommend treating this as a "project" and setting up a simple "project management system" to give you an overview of where you are at.  Personally I would use OneNote but an ordinary notebook will do just as well.   I would set up a separate section or page for each room and jot down objectives, plans, thoughts etc.  That will also serve as your progress review.  As new tasks and ideas come up you can add them into AF. Having a task in AF such as "plan kitchen" or "think about 'moving in' progress" will give you breathing space to sit down and see where you are at.  For specific issues such as unlabelled boxes, a simple approach is to just number the boxes and create a series of tasks "number boxes", "identify box contents" "move box x to room y" "sort box a" etc.  You can also keep a simple list of the boxes in your "project file" where you can add notes, record contents, but can also see at a glance what is where.<br><br>Once you feel back in control you can start setting up your main (non "moving in") AF list, ready to carry on with once you are more on top of your current project.<br><br>Very best of luck - let us know how things work out ...... :-)<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Penny,<br><br>I don't think your situation is so different from my own of renovation and decluttering.  <br>Above anything else, I think you should cut yourself some slack, you've just completed a big renovation project and sometimes it takes a while to switch gears.  I would think one of the expectations of your retirement was to enjoy yourself and do things at your own pace?  <br><br>One of the tricks for me has been to avoid dumping onto the list.  Mark F. had said that one of the reasons you should not do this is because you will end up with a page or two of tasks that are all related and it will be difficult to push yourself to do them.  I certainly found this to be true, and that is why I would disagree with Christine's advice of separating your moving in project to a different book.  <br><br>Although it may be more "efficient" to do all the unpacking, decluttering at once, etc. - if you like variety like many people do, this won't be the most enjoyable method.  <br><br>I would go through and number all the boxes in some way.  Then I would put them on my list, interspersed with other normal daily things you have going on.   When I went through them, I would sort them into essential (beautiful/useful) - pull these out and put them away, eliminate (give away, trash) and leave what's left in the box as a maybe (catalogue it in case you really do need something out of there - or take a digital picture of the contents?)  Then I'd put that box away in some kind of storage area, take it out in a few months and pull out the other things you really want to keep and get rid of the rest.<br><br>I'm a little surprised at how much time decluttering can take, particularly if you don't want to just throw everything in the trash and contribute to the landfill problem.   I'm coming to the point where I think a "free garage sale" might be a good thing.  I would also check out your local charities for organizations that do large item pickups or boxes of smaller items at your curb.  I found that freecycle is not a good use of my time.  I do miss those days in my early 20's when I could move a whole household in 2 pickup truck loads. :-)<br><br>Here's Flylady's tips for moving, she's got some good suggestions:<br><br><a href="http://www.flylady.net/pages/Flying_MovingTips.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.flylady.net/pages/Flying_MovingTips.asp</a><br><br></div>
