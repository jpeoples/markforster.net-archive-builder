<div class="content">(Ref: Columbo is an American detective show that started in the 1970s. The title character looks and acts somewhat incompetent. His trademark questioning style is laced with comments like, "Where did you get that table? The Missus is after me for new dining room furniture." As he leaves, he asks, "Just one more thing.")<br><br>Most of my tasks are very short. Five minutes or less. Yes, I've broken the projects down that far. Many are Little and Often style projects.<br><br>When tempted to do something else, I ask myself, "Can I do just one more thing?"<br><br>Usually, yes. And then one more thing, and one more thing.<br><br>Eventually, it become, "Just three more things, and you'll have a clean sweep!"<br><br>After three days, I'm seeing very good results. Yesterday went off the rails early on, and didn't settle until after supper. Then I whipped off 6 tasks in 30 minutes.<br><br>Result: Urgent things got done. Chain of doing at least half my LAOs each day is unbroken.<br><br>(Yeah, I could have called it the One More Page method, but that would remind me of whatever book I'm reading. Not what I want to do!)</div>

<div class="content">It's been said that Dostoevsky wrote all three types of murder story:<br><br>1) Crime and Punishment is the Columbo type where we know who the murderer is and the plot revolves around how the detective arrives at the solution.<br><br>2) The Brothers Karamazov is the Agatha Christie type where we don't know who the murderer is and he or she is only revealed at the end of the book.<br><br>3) The Idiot is the type where the murder comes right at the end of the book and most of the book is the events leading up to it.<br><br>So if Cricket's time management method fits the Columbo model, which time management methods fit the other two types?</div>

<div class="content">The name is more about his famous line: "Oh, just one more thing, Mr. Suspect." Said as he's leaving, after having convinced the suspect that he's bumbling around with no hope of solving the case.<br><br>Ngaio Marsh writes all three variations and more. Key events usually happen at the the beginning, 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, and 7/8 points in a story. (The Story Template by Amy Deardon.) Many authors and storytellers object to that formula, but most stories, novels movies, poems, etc. that I like, do follow it. Marsh constantly surprises me. One book, she'll delay the murder until 3/4. Another she'll start out with the murder's discovery.<br><br>As for the Columbo self-discipline model, I guess there is a mystery. Will I finish the task, and how many will I finish? (Today, not doing so well. Was too cold to run outside until almost noon, and I don't like the treadmill. Still 3 hours until bedtime, so there's hope for everything but the monthly accounting. I need an awake brain for that.</div>

<div class="content">Unfortunately, the "just one more thing" impulse is what keeps me from going to bed at a decent hour as I bumble away on the computer and think, "Just one more web page, just one more game, just one more YouTube video..." Whenever I notice that "just one more" feeling after 10pm, it's a cue for me to unplug.</div>

<div class="content">Yeah, One More Task before bed doesn't work very well. Definitely the Idiot approach.<br><br>Before reporting to my accountability group works very well.</div>

<div class="content">I always thought of myself as a melancholy Chekhovian comic figure than a tortured Dostoevskan idiot. Oh well.</div>

<div class="content">Columbo seems to get those insights just as he's leaving of course, the point of "giving up" a line of inquiry where all the questions seem to have been asked.<br><br>So, my generalised Columbo theory of insight is that insights tend to arrive as we leave our current focus, ie at the point of switching focus a gap appears.<br><br>I'd like to suggest that in those gaps we can consciously decide on moments in which we pause to be aware of what we want to do, or be, or express, rather than fill our attention with the next line of tasks. Otherwise, you will be unaware of what you want and will only respond to your task list.</div>
