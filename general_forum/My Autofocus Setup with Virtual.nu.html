<div class="content">I use Virtual.nu as a reminder of task I need todo. Why I do not just one email to me is because task later ( over 2 weeks from now will be sent to me in the correct time)<br><br>In Gmail I have a filter that take all my reminder from virtual.nu and put a label and a "red" color tag. <br>For the example the tag is called "1Reminder".<br>Then the "1Reminder" label is my list of task to work on.<br>Each morning I send an email ( Sent to sched+5min@virtual.nu ) with "Page Break" in subject. ( So my pages are not always 25-35 lines )<br>As I have Gmail client in my 3 tools  (android phone/ Galaxy / PC Laptop ) My list is always with me.<br><br>Example how I work.<br><br>Case 1. I have a task todo this week. ( Normal case) ( Ex. Buy last CD of Lady Gaga )<br>I send an email to sched@virtual.nu. This task will be sent to me 3 days from today.<br>The task comes to my list and I will work on it with the AF1 rule.<br><br>Case 2. I need todo a task today specific time. ( Ex. Pickup my car before 18.00 )<br>I send an email to sched2+1600@virtual.nu ( Note sched2 not sched ) Sched2 send an email and a reminder with Google Talk which I have in Phone/Pad/Pc.<br>So when it is 1600 I recieve the task in my list and a google talk reminder ( Let say google Talk reminder are my Urgent task ).<br><br>Case 3. I need to buy Flowers to my boss ( Just a joke ) 3 month from now. <br>Then I send an email to sched+3month@virtual.nu ( If I think I need mega reminder then I will send it to sched2+3month@virtual.nu )<br>Then 3 month from now I get the task in my list.<br><br>Not sure it is very clear :) but works for me.<br><br>If you need clarification or have question just go ahead.</div>
