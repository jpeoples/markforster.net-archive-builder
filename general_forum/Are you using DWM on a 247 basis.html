<div class="content">Hi all - Are you using DWM (or any of the other Autofocus versions) on a 24/7 basis (at least during waking hourss!) or do you only use it for part of the day?   I know some people use timeblocks for their projects, or certain recurring tasks, then switch to DWM.  Others use DWM only for their working day, others only for non-work.   I believe Mark mentioned that he uses it all day.   It would be interesting to find out the advantages and disadvantages of whichever method you use.<br>Best wishes.</div>

<div class="content">Maragret,<br>sometimes I put "schedule working on project xyz" on my list if I got a nervous feeling about the progress of a project. If this task stands out I take time to make a serious plan for so called "time boxes" in my schedule (meetings with my self). Apart from that I work from my AF list or just relax ;-)<br><br>- Jens</div>

<div class="content">Hi Margaret<br><br>I use DWM all the time.<br><br>To do so I have found it essential to use a software to-do list that allows multiple allocation of places. Thus when I move from home to office I just change my filter.<br><br>Laurence</div>

<div class="content">Margaret,<br>I rotate between e-mail, paper-work, DWM, a checklist for routine activities  and project  type work requiring fair blocks of time. The nucleus is DWM & I control the rotation process (I think of it as a rotisserie) in my DWM book. I use this system every day, for both work and non-work items. It helps me to maintain a suitable degree of balance.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks everyone - interesting stuff.  I assume that people who use DWM for work and home, and for all waking hours, add plenty of leisure tasks!  I tend to chop and change between using it all the time, and having "action DWM" as an entry on a DIT-type list.</div>

<div class="content">Margaret1,<br><br>I tend to chop and change between using it all the time, and having "action DWM" as an entry on a DIT-type list. <br><br>This sounds like a time management system within a TM system.  I did DIT and found it was quite sufficient and worked well.  How do you use DWM within DIT?<br><br>Thanks<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">Sorry, Gerry, rather than a "DIT-like" list, it's really just a Daily Checklist, incorporating Housework and laundry, Appointment Preps (meaning anything that's happening that day), Yoga and back exercises, E-Mails and Web, Paperwork, Record-keeping, and Action DWM.<br><br>These are things that I do on any "normal" day, starting first thing in the morning and usually in a particular order, so I find it easier to have it all on one separate list outside DWM.  It's perfectly possible to do it all within DWM, and sometimes I do that, if I'm in the mood to immerse myself totally in DWM on a 24/7 basis; it means I have to scan through looking for Housework, then when I've actioned it, I have to scan through looking for Appointment Preps - it can feel a bit artificial.  Of course, if I've done them in the same order the previous day, they'll appear one after another in DWM at the one-week-from-now page, but that's not always the case.  Also, as Mark says, it something NEEDS to be done now, do it now, which I suppose is what I'm doing, with the help of the daily checklist.<br><br><br>There was a method within DIT of having a Daily Checklist, and I use much the same list now, so that's why I think of it as a DIT-like list.<br><br>All of Mark's systems are brilliant, and I've used them all in their various incarnations.  No doubt I'll be eager to try any new method he develops too.</div>

<div class="content">I've taken to spending most of my time on my "current initiative" with blocks of time allocated for DWM.  DWM is still my catch-all and it gets lots of attention on most days.<br><br>It used to be my "default" to work on DWM, when there's nothing else on my calendar.  But that led to getting lots of small things done but not as much on the larger, more difficult projects.  (Though not nearly as bad as it was with AF4.)<br><br>Now if there's nothing on my calendar I focus on my "current initiative", and only work DWM when I have it blocked on my calendar.  This works nicely because I know I have a limited amount of time and it helps me to focus, and to cull and dismiss more relentlessly.<br><br>I always had a limited time before I tried this, but it always had the feeling of being unlimited, because it was unscheduled. <br><br>Several months ago, I would have had a harder time following these calendar blocks.  I am not sure what changed that makes me more receptive to them now.</div>

<div class="content">Yes, Seraphim, it's very easy to feel you've accomplished a lot because you've actioned lots of small tasks in DWM, but that's not as satisfying as actioning a large chunk of a project.</div>

<div class="content">You are so right, Mark - and your systems are brilliant at kick-starting my motivation to work on things little and often when I'm not in the mood to do large chunks of a project.  I've got to keep reminding myself that using the  "little and often" technique can mean actioning some massive project for only a minute or two, so that even if I don't feel like facing it I'm still making progress, and that leads me to feel more confident about tackling it more often and for longer periods.  <br><br>DWM is such a great safety-net for catching everything and making baby-steps lead to giant strides.</div>

<div class="content">Some people have complained that little and often isn't efficient for some types of projects, tasks, or work.  That's probably true.  But if the alternative is to do nothing because (insert your excuse for procrastination here), then it actually results in a HUGE improvement if it gets you to do ANY little thing again and again.<br><br>I've made real, significant progress on projects using little and often when I had never had the time to tackle them in the past.  As Margaret said, "baby-steps lead to giant strides. "</div>

<div class="content">One can enter a task or project at whatever level you consider will work best for that project. So you can put "Organise Summer Dance", or you can itemise the project actions on your DIT/AF/DWM list: "Confirm dates with venue", "Recruit publicist for organising committee", "Phone Sandra re catering", "Book band", etc. etc.<br><br>For that particular project, I would probably put "List Summer Ball Action" in my AF list and when I did that task I would write all outstanding action on a sheet of paper and work off that.</div>

<div class="content">I'm very interested in Mark's comment:<br><br>>>>But even the largest project is made up of many small tasks. <br><br>This is a good observation, of course, and Mark's "little and often" strategy is brilliant at ensuring you do move forward on your projects.  It's absolutely fantastic for projects that have stalled or that you're procrastinating on.  But what about projects that are moving forward, but not moving forward quickly enough to meet a deadline?<br><br>I find that if I follow Mark's advice and break a large project down, listing one or more small tasks in my list alongside all the other daily tasks I have to do, I end up doing one or two things on a project each day, and think that I've made good progress because at least the project is moving forward, without dropping the ball on the countless other tasks I have to do (like emptying my email inbox or staying up-to-date with the volunteer work I do).  But if I keep doing this day after day, I end up missing the project's deadline because my progress on the project wasn't anything like fast enough.<br><br>Given that I can't do all my daily tasks plus work enough on the project, I have to balance it somehow.  To date, my "strategy" has been to ignore my task list entirely and just work on the project, sometimes day and night to meet a deadline.  This means I do hit the deadlines, but don't get anything else done at all.  So I end up jumping from fighting fires in one area to fighting fires in another area, ignoring one project after the other to meet the closest deadline, switching frantically between them, and never getting to any of the lower-priority items that still need to be done (like replying to emails or doing my volunteer work).  Not particularly sensible (or even healthy...starting work at 3:00 AM isn't sustainable), but I've yet to find an alternative that works.<br><br>That's the problem I've been having with Mark's system -- finding the balance between big projects with deadlines and all the other stuff that needs to be done.  There's a huge difference between making *some* progress on a project, and making *enough* progress to meet the project's deadline.<br><br>Any suggestions?</div>

<div class="content">I think an effective way to handle this issue is time blocks.  So 9 to 11 am is project X and 11 to noon is work AF/DWM.  I find this works well and does not provide another complicated overlay onto your systems.<br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div>

<div class="content">But you can't do more than you can do.  If you are working on things that need to be done and are not wasting your time on the "nice to do" items, then you have too much to do.  It won't all get done.<br><br>The nice thing about Marks systems is that they get you to a point where you realize when you actually are overloaded, not just inefficient or procrastinating.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the replies, guys.<br><br>Gerry: thanks for suggesting time blocks.  I'd explored time blocks a while back, but in a round-robin kind of way which allowed me to work on multiple projects more-or-less in parallel.  Still didn't get enough done on the big projects.  Your suggestion of larger time blocks dedicated to a single big project is a great idea!<br><br>MartyH: I hear you about not being able to do more than you can do...but isn't having more than you can possibly do just part of life?  I don't know about you, but I could easily sit down for five minutes and come up with a list that would take six months to complete...and that's just the stuff I *really* ought to do or am particularly keen to finish.<br><br>I'm forever having to be brutally selective about what I allow on my lists, and simply accept that a lot of things I'd like to do / should really do just won't get done.  This is doubly so when you're a single parent -- just look at the jungle that pretends to be my front garden!<br><br>Given that there's a practically infinite list of things that ought to get done, I do need to prioritise and balance the big projects against the smaller tasks.  It's just that Mark's systems (which I do love, by the way -- I think they're brilliant) put all of them together, which means its easy to think you're making progress because the big projects and the small ones are all moving forward -- but at a rate that leaves you failing to reach your big deadlines.<br><br>That's been my experience, anyway...</div>

<div class="content">Maybe concentrate on 2 or 3 projects at a time, and spread them out so spending a little time on planning the next project while completing the previous one.<br><br>Breaking a project down into a few milestones will help measure progress by creating 'mini deadlines'.<br><br>But don't neglect basic essentials like breaks, healthy diet, exercise, sleep, family and friends.</div>

<div class="content">@Erik<br><br>I'd go along with MartyH here, the problem with projects suggests to me that you are doing too many. Can you throw out a little ballast to keep the boat afloat?<br><br>@Margaret1<br><br>It helps to be a geek to use the electronic route and even then it is hard. But it is the only way I have found to handle the issue of tasks which can be done in multiple places without having separate books and lists, or scanning through lots of irrelevant tasks.</div>

<div class="content">Erik (and all) I've experienced exactly the situation you describe. I've cycled (and recycled) various systems and I still can't seem to hit the 'sweet spot'; that point where I feel I'm getting everything done that I need to while also ensuring sufficient progress on projects. I'm a Project Manager, it's a scary place to be with that in mind.<br><br>I was introduced to AGILE as a project methodology some time back. It really resonated with me. It is effectively a way of developing software but creating  a closed bucket of features in, say, a two week period. Anything not in that two week period is called 'backlog'. During the two week development, nothing can change - nothing added, but everything done. Does this all sound familiar? Effectively, DIT is a Personal Agile process. Of course there's more to AGILE than stated here but it's a valuable parallel. In AGILE as a project manager, you know whether or not the two week period is enough because you measure the 'velocity' of Developers' work. If you know how fast a developer is working and you know they're working on a closed list, you can also predict where they will be on the end date (after 2 weeks). If you calculate that they will be late, you can take steps to speed them up, perhaps introduce another developer etc. If on time, you can leave them be or simply tell them that their current work rate is fine.<br><br>So the reason for this monologue?  I think you need to know 1. Where do you need to be by a certain point in those projects and by when 2. What is your current velocity? (1) is easy if you know the project. (2) for me is the Holy Grail; I'm just waiting for Mark to read this, have an 'aha' moment and do what he does better than all of us; deliver a toolset/approach which does it!</div>

<div class="content">To clarify terms:<br><br>'Agile' is actually more a philosophy and attitude than a methodology.  'To follow agile' is like 'to follow Mark Forster', as it's not specific.  <br><br>Several agile methods do work as you describe, but not all.  Scrum is an example of an agile process which includes the elements you describe.  Kanban (discussed a few weeks ago here) is a different approach, which can be Agile, but does not work as described.</div>

<div class="content">Velocity, eg. number of things accomplished per week, does vary.  You have to take a statistical approach and measure over a longer period to get the proper average.  There's also a skill in choosing similar sized tasks to measure so it makes sense.  There's also skill in establishing conditions such that you can work at a steady pace and not change speed wildly from one week to the next.<br><br>I haven't begun to master this, though I imagine some out there have.</div>
