<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>You have given so much of your time and thinking. You owe us nothing, but I am concerned you are not well as you have not updated this blog in a while. Whether you choose to post information or not, I sincerely hope you are okay and wanted to thank you for your ideas on productivity.</div>

<div class="content">I would echo these comments.  Ten years ago I was between jobs for a long period.  Reading the active forum really helped keep me going.  I will be forever grateful for that.</div>

<div class="content">Yes, Mark’s words have been an inspiration to me as well. I’ve been reading the books again and finding there is gold yet to be discovered.</div>

<div class="content">En. and all,<br><br>Thanks for the comments and concern. I haven't been ill, and I've just got back from holiday in Georgia (the country, not the state). My lack of posting is simply that at the age of 75 I have other interests now and only feel like adding something occasionally.</div>

<div class="content">An observation:<br><br>David Allen (a bit younger than Mark) is making the rounds promoting the new GTD workbook. If the reviews are to be believed, it's not very good (I returned my copy. Similar to Covey's workbook for 7 Habits, it seems like a cash grab, and really doesn't add anything to the system). <br><br>Interestingly, in their 70s, Allen, Covey and Forster all seem(ed) to be enjoying the fruits of their labour. <br><br>However it seems only Forester continued to tweak, refine and push the boundaries in the areas of life management and productivity. While I don't think this strategy made him rich - milking AF would have likely been a more lucrative path - it does show Mark's character. <br><br>Personally, I'm re-reading Mark's first book and creating scatter maps every am. His thoughts and tools continue influence a lot of my workflow - both in practice, and principle. <br><br>Enjoy your time Mark.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>I'm happy you crossed Georgia off your to-visit list. I lived there for five years—and revisited this past summer. As an American, I've probably uttered "the country, not the state" five thousand times in my conversations over the years. Even then, still elicited blank stares or "Is that in Russia?" Hope you enjoyed the wine and food!<br><br>I'll echo everyone else's comments that this blog has been a tremendous influence on me. I consider Mark to be one of the foremost thinkers/experimenters on these topics, and his writings would be the first I'd recommend to anyone who needs to get their life/work into shape.<br><br>Skip GTD. Try DIT or AF first.</div>

<div class="content">avrum - I agree, Mark keeps generating new and better ideas, far more than the other gurus, who seem to spend a lot of their attention monetizing their old ideas. <br><br>On the other hand, maybe Mark could market his own line of notebooks.

<div class="content">I wonder if Mark has seen this “surpinsingly” masterpiece of proof reading<br><br>https://www.amazon.co.uk/surprinsingly-forget-things-them-Forster/dp/1086410491</div>

<div class="content">Gadgets:<br><br>Well spotned!<br><br>I've put a suitably caustic comment on the ad, though whether it will get through Amazon's censorship procedure I don't know.</div>
