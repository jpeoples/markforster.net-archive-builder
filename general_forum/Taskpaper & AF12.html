<div class="content">Google tasks was never a permanent solution for me. While I enjoyed the convience of having my tasks synced at all times, I found the site to be slow. Worse, when experiencing a weak 3G signal, I had trouble accessing my tasks. <br><br>Here's how I use Taskpaper:<br><br>1) Pages are created using a ":" i.e. Page 1:<br>2) Page length is determined by the height of my computer screen (no scrolling allowed)<br>3) I have seperate views for the following:<br><br>a) For clean pages: <br>project = "Page 1" and not @done and not @waiting and not @dismiss<br>b) To determine where to put my dismissal line:<br> not @waiting<br>c) To paste entire "clean page" list into iPhones note app**<br>not @done and not @waiting and not @dismiss<br><br>** Here's how I how I carry my list with me:<br>1) In the AM, I email an entire "clean page" (c) to myself<br>2) On my iPhone, I copy the list and paste it into the note app<br>3) Follow AF instructions<br>4) When I'm working on a task, I place a "!" before the task<br>5) When the task is complete, I place a "$" before the task<br><br>I update taskpaper at the end of the day. <br><br>Although this is a temporary measure until the taskpaper iphone app is released, I'm finding the review helpful i.e. updating taskpaper at the end of the day.</div>

<div class="content">Avrum, isn't this going to get really tedious? That's why I can't imagine reverting to "pages." And all I had to do was create a new default context for pages when one was full. My list is only a couple of pages long now anyway with the approach I use.</div>

<div class="content">Mel - to date, it isn't tedious. And it allows me to use taskpaper (which I love). Moreover, having tried AF1/2, I really dig the added intuition element of returning to the beginning of the list. So all in all, things are working well.</div>

<div class="content">Do you think if someone set up org-mode in a similar fashion it would be just as frictionless and intuitive as Taskpaper? What, if any, are the strengths, weaknesses, limitations of committing to one over the other? Especially with keeping in mind that native task support will be included in iphone OS5, do you think there's any advantage over task apps which sync with iCal or popular online task sites? <br><br>I use 2do predominantly, and set up Filemaker's Bento with smart views to my tasks which emulates Autofocus closed lists. In any case, the content is derived from my iCal tasks (which is great because I know the shortcut, and as a fall back, I can drag drop tasks, reminders, events, all in one interface even should google tasks get up to snuff.) Also, how is Taskpaper with the Natural Project Planning method? With Bento, I can populate project tasks directly into my Autofocus system. Do you get a similar smooth transition from building up outlines (or other divergent planning tools) to feeding actionable items into AF?</div>

<div class="content">I wonder if you'd expand on how you use Bento? I've always wanted to like that program but never had much luck.</div>

<div class="content">Avrum:<br>My tip for using Google Tasks is combo with free GoTasks for iPhone. It works offline/online, sync with Google Tasks, has perfect yet simple interface and has even better functionality than Google Tasks (e.g. view all lists at once by date/manual sort, focus on one thread, on-screen edit, easily move or add new tasks, collapse/expand hierarchy etc). I use it now and I am totally satisfied (for AF, I still use paper at the moment).</div>

<div class="content">Just to lasso the last set of questions, I'd love to share with you how I create closed lists and an AF system in Bento using native task entries in iCal in a separate thread. The real frontier I'm facing right now is how to use any chosen tools not just as a routine, but as an instilled habit. That's where my head is these days.<br><br>For those of you who may be interested in org-mode, however, it is a buffer mode which is now native to the Emac distribution. Emac is a popular text editor for coder types. In other words, the questions I had were in direct response to this thread topic, as Taskpaper uses a text file to parse tasks from projects and freehand notes. <br><br>What could really be the cusp of this subject is how seamlessly the project planning materials interact with the task management with this approach. Most advise on this forum suggests that we allocate these activities to different frameworks or tools. Project planning happens outside the AF scaffold, many would argue. <br><br>Another big appeal to either taskpaper or org-mode would be how they address tags and views. I've since learned that org-mode has a one-key per tag interface which can greatly reduce human error and monotony in typing out tags each time. You need tags in either platform for AF, because you need markers to describe its status, mark the end of a page  and other place savers (as there typically isn't a finite physical page in the digital realm), and for other reasons-not to over document your activities.<br><br>This tag support goes without saying in Taskpaper, which has a very nice iphone polish. I've long argued that buttons and a constrained vocabulary of tags would rule over text or handwritten entry of tags, but now I see that org-mode has a comparable, simple entry for tags as does Taskpaper. It was this kind of observation and opinion that I was really trying to suss out.</div>
