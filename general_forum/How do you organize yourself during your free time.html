<div class="content">During regular working hours I've been able to be more or less effective using scheduled work sessions and breaks and a long list, but I haven't been able to figure out how to be consistently "productive" (feel like I'm using my time well) during my free time (evenings and weekends). <br><br>I've tried scheduling "work"/focus sessions (when I'm on my personal list), but it feels too constrained for down time, and I end up with breaks where I don't know what to do. I've tried no schedule but it seems without promised breaks I kinda of avoid lists.<br><br>I know some people do the same processes in their time off as during work, but it seems some also do different processes.<br><br>So I'm curious, how do each of you organize yourselves during your free time? Is it different/the same as during work?</div>

<div class="content">I only use Mark’s methods when I’m working. My free time at weekends is usually spent with my wife… who does a pretty good job of organising me.</div>

<div class="content">I organize my free time following Mark Forster’s ideas, or more recently with my Goal process.<br><br>Work currently is a very linear process at the level I track it, so tools like Autofocus aren’t needed.  The process there is like:<br><br>Write the current task.  Do it.  Make notes.  Mark it done.<br>The next task is often found by reviewing these notes for things not yet done.</div>

<div class="content">I note lots of tasks in my AF notebook, but when I sit down in the evening after my dayjob, or on the weekend when other larger tasks/errands have been looming and need dispatching, I find that Serial No-List is my preferred go-to. Whatever's on the top of my mind is usually worth following; I may also ask the question "what am I putting off NOT doing?" just to refresh the Google search of my mind and see what else emerges. And of course, include distractions and fun stuff/downtime activities on that list also.<br><br>It can be a long list! After the list is made, standing-out makes the choices.</div>

<div class="content">Bearing in mind that it's 35 years since I last worked set hours in an office, I make no distinction between work and personal as far as time management is concerned.</div>
