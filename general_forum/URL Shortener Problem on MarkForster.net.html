<div class="content">Is anyone else getting this "Destination unknown" from markforster.net when clicking on links in emails you subscribed to this blog?<br><br>For example, this link <a href="http://markforster.net/forum/post/2722051" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.net/forum/post/2722051</a> gives "Destination unknown" error. When I manually change it to <a href="../general_forum/Solving AF1's problems.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2722051</a> that gets me to the right place on this blog.<br><br>Screenshots here: <a href="http://photos.app.goo.gl/WTYtUfY2SH6cggKbA" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://photos.app.goo.gl/WTYtUfY2SH6cggKbA</a></div>

<div class="content">BTW, there is also a "reCAPTCHA" problem. I couldn't post here while not logged in. Could only do it after I logged in.</div>

<div class="content">I get similar errors when following links from RSS feed readers like Feedly.</div>

<div class="content">I think all these errors are caused by the fact that I'm using an old version of SquareSpace which is no longer fully supported. But I don't intend to expend the effort which would be required to update it to a current version - so I'm afraid you are going to have to put up with it!<br><br>The Captcha by the way is turned off, so you shouldn't still be seeing it. I think you will find you can just click through it without entering anything.</div>

<div class="content">I don't get it unless I try create a post with a URL. Then it gives me a captcha.</div>

<div class="content">james220:<br><br>That's interesting and would explain why the amount of spam that gets through is very low.<br><br>If you just click on it without trying to fill in the Captcha details it should take you through.</div>

<div class="content">Thank you for turning off the Captcha. Now I can post again!</div>

<div class="content">I use Feedly, too. My work-around is to go to the main page, then look on the lower right for Latest Comments. It works unless there are more than 10 I haven't seen.<br><br>Has anyone found an RSS feed for the forums?</div>

<div class="content">The link problem is also on the page that lists all of Mark’s systems, menu item TM systems. Too bad, that is a good place to look up any system referred to in the conversations. Seems like Squarespace would continue to support links on the site, regardless of the version.</div>

Retyping the ".squarespace.com" instead of ".net" isn't too much hassle.<br><br>Though I did consider making a Greasemonkey userscript active on "mail.google.com" that automatically change "markforster.net" to become "markforster.squarespace.com", but haven't put that task on my list yet.<br><br>Searching for old Andreas Hofmann Userscript did get on my list though. ;-)</div>
