<div class="content">Being a visual person I seem to "get things" much better when I have a visual presentation of an idea. Loved the video with Mark Forster, just seeing him present his notepad with lists gave me a better understanding of AF. (Or maybe it's just my voyeuristic side...)<br><br>So why not share what our different AF systems look like? I've created a flickr group where we can share pics and videos (didn't know where else we could easily share pics/videos).<br><br>Haven't uploaded any pictures yet myself (will do that when I get to it on my AF list! ;-)<br><br>Welcome to share your (visual) take on AF at:<br><a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/1012758@N20/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/groups/1012758@N20/</a><br><br>The group is named "Autofocus time system by Mark Forster" to separate from all groups about cameras and autofocus...<br><br>/jonaz</div>

<div class="content">I have now added a more "human readable" groupname to the flickr group:<br><a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/autofocustimesystem" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/groups/autofocustimesystem</a><br><br>If you upload pictures to the group ypu might want to tag the picture with "autofocustimesystem" as well (to differentiate from all pictures dealing with camera autofocus systems...)</div>

<div class="content">The group should be set so that everyone can see the pictures in the group pool (you need to be a member to post though, don't think there's a setting to allow non-members to post pictures as far as I can see).<br><br>At the moment there seems to be some glitches over at flickr so that no pictures are being shown to non-member of the flickr group. I'm hoping for a speedy recovery...</div>

<div class="content">I figured out the "some pictures are only visible to group members" thing! It's not a glitch, but it sure seems pointless and annoying. In flicker, you have to post at least five pictures before your pictures are visible in public. So pictures by people who have >=5 pics are visible to non-members, pictures by people who have <5 pics are not visible to non-members.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Andreas<br><br>Thanks for that info!  As I only have 4 pictures posted I gues mine are invisible! Is your next project to set up an AutoFocus image site?</div>
<h2>Reply by Andreas Hofmann</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-03-30 10:09</div>
<div class="content">Christine:<br><br>Yes, it's your pictures (4) and mine (3) that are invisible to non-members. So far, I didn't think about setting up my own image site. I thought more along the terms of adding two more pictures to flickr to make them visible. ;-)<br><br>I did think about adding some "community features" to autofocus.cc, namely a forum, a wiki and a bugtracker. But I don't want to compete with Mark's own forum and I think saw some mention of someone already setting up an autofocus wiki. The bugtracker still sounds like a good idea, though.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Andreas<br><br>I guess I'm a lot like many others who don't want to become members of hundreds of different sites - AutoFocus is my only foray into Flickr and I'm sure there are a lot of people who are happy to be involved with specific AutoFocus projects but not adding every other social network feature onto their lists.<br><br>I certainly agree with you about not wanting to compete with Mark's own forum. Whilst it  does seem that Mark is happy to have other ideas out there - and there is no way to control everything that appears on the internet - I think the important thing is that a project is fully supportive of AF and gives full credit to Mark and his system, such as your autofocus.cc .</div>

<div class="content">Christine:<br><br>I understand your concern about having too many site memberships. I too only signed up for yahoo to access the autofocus mailing list and the autofocus flickr group (thankfully they're both by yahoo so only one login is needed for both). Seeing as you have one picture more on flickr than I have, that would make you the flickr pro between the two of us. ;-)<br><br>I just think creating my own image site with features rivaling flickr (especially the notes that can be embedded into the pictures) would be a lot of work, and I propably should put that work into other things, as the flickr group seems good enough. That non-members can't see every picture is not great, but eventually I will post two other pictures concerning af.cc to the group and it will be alright.<br><br>A nice solution would be for Mark's forum to support image uploads, then we could post them all in a thread here.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Andreas<br><br>The potential for image uploads sounds like a good idea.  I'm pretty much a novice when it comes to websites - but hope to have one up and running shortly :-)  - so don't know what is possible and what isn't. I'm not sure but think Mark may have said that SquareSpace don't offer that feature but I may be wrong.</div>

<div class="content">Why not send pictures to the person who has the most already and then they will be visible.<br><br>I agree with you ... I'm about up to here with group memberships in order to do one simple thing.  I'd love to see pictures of people's implementations but not so much that I want to join another group, list, or silly social network.  A pox on them all ;-)</div>

<div class="content">I just saw that Christine has now more than five pics, but they are still not showing. Found this in the faq:<br><br>"If your account is new, first you need to upload at least 5 photos. After that minimum has been reached, then it shouldn't take more than a few days until your photos appear in searches, groups, etc."<br><br>So it should only be a matter of time now.</div>

If you don't want your picture on my site please let me know. I moved all pictures from flickr except the one by Sarah Michelef, since she blocked download the fullsize image, which I think means she doesn't want it outside of flickr.</div>

<div class="content">CHRISTINE, I'm all with you about having a zillion logins to a billion social sites (and *every* site is making it's claim to social media fame these days...) ;-) That's why I set it up at flickr - figured many people already had flickr accounts.<br><br>ANDREAS, very nice image site! Like the clean interface, tags and star rating. I miss the in-picture comments feature which I think really adds value to images over at flickr.<br><br>I have no problems with having my images at images.autofocus.cc - however I would like to be told about that (preferably via the site that had the images to begin with, and not on another site (ie this)).<br><br>Even though I have no problems with my images (at least my autofocus images) being used on other sites, I feel I am being "robbed" of the feedback. I put the pictures up to share with others and to be able to get comments and feedback on them. When they are being used on another site (without me being told) I risk missing valuable input and comments.<br><br>And - even though I don't mind having my pictures used on another site - I *do* (did) have the licence "All rights reserved" on them (which I admit is more of a lapsus/preference setting than a thought-through decision). <br><br>In my book it is a BIG NO-NO using/transfering images that have "All rights reserved". *Especially* on a site that so wonderfully contributes to CreativeCommons by allowing users to set different CreativeCommons licences on their images. Being a graphic designer I feel quite strongly about that.<br><br>(I have now set a very allowing CC-licence on my flickr-images, so you are NOW free to use them...)<br><br>» Learn more about CreativeCommons at CreativeCommons.org | <a href="http://ww.creativecommons.org" rel="nofollow">http://ww.creativecommons.org</a></div>

<div class="content">Jonaz: <br><br>Thank you for your understanding and explanations. I have decided to revert to my opinion expressed in this post: <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/672805#post709548" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/672805#post709548</a><br><br>I just infringed for the second time since joining this forum on the rights of others through unthoughtful action. I have to stop doing that.<br><br>I don't think it's worth all the hassle to have just another image site, even one you don't have to be logged in to see all the pictures. Christine's images are finally visible at flickr, which leaves only a handful of others. So I shut down the gallery for now, seeing as it's main purpose was to enable Mike to take a look at Christine's mind maps. As you rightfully said, flickr has more and better features, and I'm not willing to invest the time to bring my site to that level.</div>

<div class="content">And I do thank you for that transfer, Andreas.  Who knows how long it might have been before things became visible over at Flicker.<br><br>Jonaz, I also thank you for setting up that Flicker area.   I might point out, however, that not all people have Flicker accounts.  I'd be surprised if even "most" do.  Personally, I do not join any of these popular sites.  I just don't see the point in trying to get people to "join" me or call me a friend.  Those who are, know it ;-)</div>

<div class="content">@Mike: I guess different sites have different coverage in different countries and "segments". I'm not using flickr particularly as a "social media" site in that I BFF people left and right - I use it to show pictures (not that many I must admit ;-)<br><br>Assuming that people have yahoo accounts to a larger extent than yahoo I think is a US-view(?). Thinking of it though - isn't flickr integrated with yahoo login?<br><br>The best solution would perhaps to share pictures here at markforster.net if that was possible.<br><br>Otherwise I guess we're having to login/connect to one site or another. Joining "popular sites" seems more worthwhile than joining "unpopular" though.. ;-)<br><br>Sunny spring greeting from a sunny Stockholm<br>/jonaz</div>

<div class="content">Been using AF since the infamous Lifehacker post, and am thrilled with my results. Mark is really onto something here. While some of my first posts were for using Taskpaper for Autofocus, I moved to a Levenger Circa notebook. Nothing beats paper.</div>

<div class="content">GC,<br><br>Just added jpegs to the group.

<div class="content">The task pages are homemade - used the Levenger notation pages, but my tags were spilling over into the tasks, and vice versa, so I decided a DIY solution was better. <br><br>If you have the Junior Size Circa, you can goto any paper store, buy a ream of 60-lb double bond A4 (similar to what Levenger uses) and have them but the whole stack in half. You'll be able to "roll your own" at that point, although the Levenger Desk Punch is a must. 1000 Junior sheets may be a bit overkill, but you sure won't run out of pages for a while :-)</div>

<div class="content">Here is a link to the .pdf - the note page is upside down for easier double-sided printing (at least it's easier for my printer).<br><br><a href="http://files.me.com/jeremy.benz/z0p3vk" rel="nofollow">http://files.me.com/jeremy.benz/z0p3vk</a></div>

<div class="content">This is perfect. Thank you. I have the punch and I do have the Junior size. So, to understand you correctly, I will take the 60lb A4 paper and have it cut exactly in half (at the width). <br><br>And as far as the printing goes, I assume one selects A5 paper size?</div>
<h2>Reply by palletguru</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-04-7 23:57</div>
<div class="content">Glad this will work for you. As for printing, I use a mac, and entered a custom paper size with dimensions of 5 1/2" x 8 1/2" - my printer (a Canon MX850) has an adjustable feeder in the back. The pages go in "portrait wise" and the printing works great. <br><br>Since the A5 is smaller than the Junior page size, A5 printing should work, but be sure you have print scaling selected (same on both windows and mac). The result will be just about the same, but the margins will be a bit larger if you are printing to A5 size on 5 1/2" x 8 1/2" paper.<br><br>If you can setup the custom paper size (in Windows I think you can do this in MS Publisher or Word), then you'll be using a greater percentage of the available space. I use a .5mm gel pen, which makes a nice, consistent, and fine line on the pages, which can help to cram a lot of info into a small space.</div>
