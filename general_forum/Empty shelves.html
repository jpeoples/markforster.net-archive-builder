<div class="content">Contaminated by the enthusiasm of some and as I was in town, I looked for a diary (UK English, I would say agenda).  Alas, I am 6 days too late, the shelves are empty, only the moleskine-like notebooks are left and the filofax part.  Plan B: Maybe I can improvise something with an Atoma (Circa) binder.</div>

<div class="content">Damien,<br><br>Leverage offers calendar sheets for the Circa.  A bit on the expensive side so I did not go that way.  I just used the ruled sheets and dated them myself.  Easy enough.<br><br>If you have the punch, you could print your own calendar sheets and punch them.  Someone recently posted a link to a calendar program that prints in any size, IIRC.</div>

<div class="content">Mornin' Mike,<br>Leverage? Was that a Freudian slip of some sort, Mike?  Levenger....or is it simply that you're due for another cuppa!  BTW, last blizzard warning here has reduced it to about 14" total accumulation......OTOH, they've been off almost as often as they're spot on.  I prefer the 10 to 20 inch reduction.  Afterall, it's not like I'm going to be skiing in powder.  I'm going to be walking the dog.  Even 6 inches would pretty up the scenery enough!  LOL!

I also love using clipboards. I use the clear page inserts for pages I intend to keep. I don't like all those punches on papers I'll likely archive.<br>How do you run yours?  <<<<br><br>I'm just getting started so I'll recap where I am so far.<br><br>I started with my Composition book ... I was using it for AF4 so I started a new one to use for this.  I started dating the pages but got so horribly confused I had to find a better way.<br><br>Since I want some degree of portability I opted to use the Circa Compact (nominally 4x8 or so, I think).  (I was already using that for my schedule ... calendar, daily lists, etc.  I use the Circa Junior for my plans and projects.)<br><br>I started dating the pages.  I already had the Jan-Dec dividers with one page for each with one page for key dates for each month.  You know, one line per day for birthdays, tax filing dates, car registration renewal, etc.  I also had some blank dividers I was not using so I took three of them and labeled them (in different colored inks) "Today", "Re-Enter), and "New".  Those are the 1, 7, and 30 day points, respectively.<br><br>I decided to try dating them.  It seemed to be a good thing to have them dated as I might also use them for some appointment things ... maybe in a box or a different colored ink.  Mark seems against that but hell, it seems excessive for me to have two calendars going.<br><br>Then Alan made his brilliant observation that you could just number the pages 1-31 and forget dates entirely.  This appeals to me because I could stop and start the system, as when I go on a vacation, with no trouble at all.<br><br>In talking with Jacqueline, I realized that I could ALSO just block out my vacation dates (when they get close) and skip over them as if they did not exist at all.  That would work as well.  I'm not sure what I'll do.  I have my book dated up to the end of March so I don't need to decide anything yet.  I'll need to decide when it gets to the 1st of March what to do about April and beyond.  I may want to number rather than date the pages then.  I'll see.<br><br>I took my old AF4 book and began going through it discarding a lot of stuff and feeding what I was going to get to into the 30 day point.  Initially I just put a handful of items in.  Gradually I've been adding more and more. I'm also not worrying too much about exactly where I put things.  I know Mark mentioned that he did not care awfully about that either.<br><br>My pages are set up as follows:  The Compact has places for 25 line entries, if you use every last inch.  I drew a vertical line at 1.25 inches.  That gives me two columns or 50 items.  I have no clue how much I'll need.  I started dating each PAGE.  Now I'm thinking that I want each SHEET to be be a separate date.  My thinking is that it will make the moving of the pages easier.  Now I have two different days on each side of the page so it is still a bit confusing to move pages.  It would be MUCH nicer to have only one day per sheet.  I'll surely do that come April.<br><br>Maybe less important to you is the pen.  I am portable so I want to put some kind of loop on the thing.  There are things I can buy from Levenger but given how much they charge for junk, I'll probably make something.  I also have an industrial strength rubber band I wrap around the book to keep it closed as I travel.<br><br>One problem I'll probably deal with later is the paper itself.  With all the flipping around I doubt the ring holes will last.  The paper is just not heavy enough.  I can fix that by printing my own and punching it.  If I do that, I'll type my tasks in when I can so they'll be mostly printed as well ... or maybe not.  The downside of thicker paper will be a thicker book.  right now I'm only keeping the pages I need plus a month.  (IOW, right now I've got Feb, March, and April but no further.)  I've already had to replace the rings the book comes with and move up to 1/2 inch rings.  I may wind up at 3/4" if I go to heaver paper.<br><br>The other thing to note about this setup is that I MUST use a fine point pen and use VERY few words to get it all in 1.25 inches.  It is tight but it will work.<br><br>Let me know what you come up with.  I imagine you could work in the letter size format and maybe put more than one day on a page ... maybe even a week.<br><br>Oh, and as I mentioned elsewhere, Levenger sells calendar sheets for the various sized Circa  books.  Of course, the price is astronomical, most likely ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike<br>I'll need to lengthen my 15 minute break to answer your tome!  lol!  When I bother noticing the flavor or coffee I like Hawaii Blue.  There's a Jamaican coffee that's good also but I can't pull the name out of my brain right now.  Usually I chug the cup to counteract my zombie status.<br><br>SURVIVE?  LOL!  Around here they simply advised to have milk and staples to last about 24 to 30 hours because the visability will be close to zero with the high winds.  Then they stated that on Sunday things will be back to business as usual.  They also joked about the fact that all three of our storms occurred on weekends so that the kids didn't get any extra days off!  LOL!  bummer!<br><br>Holy Moly......You must have a really steady hand and eagle vision!  lol!  When the pain is bad enough, I'll white board my list about 3 items at a time.  When one is done, I erase it and add the next one.  While you're reading from 1/4' by 1 1/2 ", My stuff is emblazened in 2 to 3 inch lettering!  ROTFL!  Having a stand height desk comes in really handy when I'm a hurting!  The huge lettering blasts my aims right through the pain I'm fighting plus it saves me a few steps and prevents me from having to lean my head forward to read.  I also have my routine stuff on index cards.  I just slap those puppies on my sheet metal board and I'm good to go.  (They are written in large letters just for this purpose)  The less deciding I have to do, the more work I can crank out despite the pain.<br><br>I only have 4 things on my March 05 page so far.  If something is < than 15 minutes or so, it's easier to just do the damn thing rather than have it in my future!  LOL!<br><br>Of course, I've only done one hour so far.  I'm sure that within today's four hours, I'll start to get a feel for how Mark's system works.  I only have one quasi-lousy project so I don't have anything solid to test it against my attitude!  *blush*......we'll see.  Maybe I'll still use my timer to give it every advantage to work properly!  LOL!  So far, the only thing that does a reliable job on my "Stubborn Ass Syndrome" is using timer launches set at very low intervals.  I decide the interval based on the degree of resistance or anxiety levels I'm experiencing.  I'm hoping that I get the same relief with Mark's system that people have been reporting about.  Again, I don't have anything too lousy to throw at it!  LOL!  Yeah, I know.  Today is accounts day.  Maybe when I actually belly up to the job, I'll get a fresh supply of resistance to test!  ROTFL!<br>Well, I'll scan a few more posts and then I've got to back back to work.  I'm hoping to be done before the snow comes to give Missy one more long walk......<br>Good luck with DWM!  Wish me good luck as well!<br>learning as I go</div>

Although, maybe I might be courageous and forego it and let Mark's system run.  Who knows?  I might like it better!  Have you come up against how you're going to work the weekly review yet?

IOW, I will look at my goals and maybe scan the AF list to find things that need to be scheduled into my day.  Then I will turn to the list when I'm out of things to do from my schedule. Know what I mean?  I'm fine with little and ofen for some things, but other things need a big slug of concentration.<br><br>I do a weekly review and a much faster daily review.  The weekly review keeps me on track with my big projects and my daily keeps me on track for the day.</div>

<div class="content">Learning,<br><br>I keep forgetting about your limitations ... you really don't seem "limited" LOL ;-)<br><br>In that case, why not use your big ass lettering on 3x5 or even 4x6 cards, Circa punch them, and stick them between appropriately sized covers.  You can pull them out, move them around, stick them on your board ... whatever ;-)<br><br>In that case, you could number/date the cards and batch them by date and put them in the book with dated dividers ... even colors maybe.  You could alternate white, red, blue, green, etc.  If you had 7 colors you could even standardize the colors by day and it would be quick to see what's up.  You'd have four series of 7 colors for a 28 day month.  (In that case I would bag Mark's 30 day system and go to 28.  It would be easier for you to work it that way.<br><br>If you did cards, you'd probably decide how many tasks went on a card.  Maybe only one if you had to write large.  This is fun.  I love designing systems ... maybe almost as much as Mark does ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike<br>I have my dailies and weeklies on card when I need them.  I'll also use index cards for portable focus aides.  But I prefer my weekly sheet set up separately as a map to follow.  I KNOW that's where my main aims are.  I'm used to it.  I tried to do one time tasks on index cards as well but my list seems to work better.  Don't laugh but whiteboarding my list with only two or three things at a time really helps me keep my focus.  If it's not emblazened on the board, it doesn't exist until I get to erase one and put a new one on the bottom.  It's like a rolling scroll effect!  It sounds dorky, but when I need it, I love the effect it has on me.  When folks give me the business about it, I simply shrug my shoulders and tell them that's the way my brain is working at this time.  <br>For some strange reason, it really helps me a lot.  Maybe it's the visual impact...or maybe I'm not losing energy by creating more pain....I dunno!!!!!  It works!  That's all I need to know!  LOL!<br>learning as I go<br><br>p.s. when I tried to tier the cards in the circa, it didn't register at all.   BTW, in case I didn't tell you............I need LOTS of white space between each sentence.  Otherwise, my brain garbles it up.  I can read ok but I can't translate a long string of words into a directive.  Go figure!  LOL!  My brain has lots of dumb quirks.  I'm sure it has something to do with the cognitive rehab.  It geared other parts of my brain to take over some of the damaged areas.  Maybe for some cognitive processes, it's not a perfect reconstruction!  It's MUCH better now so I'd better not complain too much...............lol!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Learning,<br><br>Are you saying that you move your car back and forth to keep the ground clear?  Interesting.  I never thought of that ;-)<br><br>I think AF works best for "level of effort" things.  If I'm going to build a deck I don't use AF ... it is a project with a plan and a schedule ... if not, it will never get done.  When I practice skeching, I do it little and often.  When I practice piano, it is little and often.  Cleaning house is little and often and works in AF.  AF is a system like any other and has uses but you can't do everything with it.  Hell, you can't even do everything with a Swiss Army knife.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike<br>You and Lillian are both partly correct.  I do little and often to both clear off the auto itself and also I drive it to clear about 18inches or so under the wheels for clear traction.  Then I move it back.  This is only necessary when that 50 mile per hour wind creates a snow drift and burys my tires.  If I do this often enough, there's little labor in keeping my auto ready and able to drive.  If I didn't have my injuries, I wouldn't need to do this so much...but, I'm NOT going to risk tripping off any pain bouts!  LOL!  I'd rather overdo the cautions a bit.<br><br>It's snowing almost horizontally here!  The snowflakes are THICK and heavy.....maybe I'll just open my wallet if it gets too difficult for me....but I'm going to try to do it myself.  I like being outside.  Also it's an excuse for Missy to get outdoors and enjoy the snow!<br>My neighbor and I have made a pact to go out at midnight to sweep down the first layer.  We'll know better then what we're up against!  LOL!  She has two autos, I have one and we anonymously do the disabled lady's car who lives nearby.  We'll have enough to do to keep our muscles and blood warm!  LOL!<br>I'm actually excited!

<div class="content">Hey Learning,<br><br>Mmmm, thanks for the hot toddy ;-)  That sounds like a well planned out system to keep yourself and your neighbors free.<br><br>I was just out shoveling (about a couple of hours ago) and this is a very different snow than we had last time.  Last time it was light and fluffy.  This time it is wet and heavy.  Exhausting to shovel.  Take care.  Maybe hire some kids to help.<br><br>We don't have a fireplace ... at least not one that works right now.  We converted to propane and have not gotten the propane hooked up yet.  Our chimney was a fire hazard and and it made sense to tear it out.  Also, propane has better resale value.<br><br>It is great looking out the window watching the snow fall.  I'm expecting a power outage soon.  The lights have been dimming on and off for a while.  The snow is heavy and the trees are going to start breaking under the weight.  That will bring down power lines.<br><br>I'm looking forward to tomorrow.  It should be a BEAUTIFUL morning ;-)<br><br>Oh, after I cleared a path to the mailbox, I found my new Spring Planting Lee Valley catalog.

Oh well, I simply keep up with keeping the auto clear and wait until the snow and the road crews finish what they are going to do.  They really jammed it in there.  The snow is wet and heavy.  If there's an arctic blast, I'm screwed!  LOL!<br>I used to love getting my garden catalogs.  My favorite was Fields.  It was the discount from Spring's catalog.  It was fun designing gardens.  I used to do landscaping on the side as well when people would be knocking on my door or leaving notes asking who landscaped my gounds!  LOL!

<div class="content">What a dope I am.  Gurney's was my most favorite.  This brain is an embarrassment!  *blush*  The stock is EXCELLENT with very fair prices!  And it offers a decent range to appeal to different budgets.  Best of all, they ship their stuff carefully and quickly!  It all adds up to a great experience.  I NEVER had anything shipped to me in less than great health.  They even allow you to choose the maturity level when you're buying trees and shrubs!  Of course there's a limit.  Sometimes I simply had to swallow it and pay for the marked up prices at the landscape farms or garden markets....I always tried to use bulk rate and continuous business as my only leverage when negotiating down the price.  The more mature stuff is expensive to buy, transport and plant.  No, I don't know how to use a crane or bulldoser.  I wouldn't fool with that aspect of it!  LOL!<br>learning as I go</div>
