<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-05-15 0:36</div>
<div class="content">Hi everyone,<br><br>I have been lurking here for a month or two.  I read Mark's book on DIT and was excited to try it out.  When I searched the net for details (actually on Mark's box filing system), I found to my dismay that DIT had been 'superceded' by AF.  However, reading the forums was so informative and entertaining,  I decided to try AF instead.<br><br>Long story short, I have been more productive on AF than I could have imagined.  I usually put a lot of effort into devising and perfecting systems to get things done without actually getting anything done ;)<br><br>I have noticed that a lot of the things I put on my list are efforts to 'game' the system, and when I undo them, I make better progress (example: writing a lot of fluff tasks on each page so I'd always have something easy to do, or adding "look for urgent items on the list and do them" on every page).  I have completed about 10 pages and have about 52 more or less completed ones.<br><br>My list is quite unwieldy and I've compounded the problem by adding tasks I fear will slip through the cracks to multiple pages, so I've ended up with a lot of repeated items.  I've been using these strategies to try to repair this:<br><br>1) When I see a task twice in one day (such as, "pay bills" or "check AF forums")  I'll mark it done the second time without actually doing it again, unless it the only one left on the list.<br><br>2) When I see a task I don't want to do (and can't dismiss since I've worked on the page already), I'll turn it into a 'decide whether to do this task' by adding a ? and 'No' to the end, then mark it done, like this:<br>___ Sort books in rainbow order<br>_x_ Sort books in rainbow order ? No<br>BTW, this is not a real example - I still intend to sort my books in rainbow order :)<br><br>3) I will sometimes collect ten or more actions from the entire list (many of which are variations on "work on project x"), put them on a page in a "project" notebook, mark them all done on the AF list, then re-enter a single line.  For example:<br>work on basement finish<br>collect basement finish sketches in a file<br>mop up drywall dust in basement<br>call on leaky window in basement<br>spend 20 minutes on basement finish<br><br>becomes<br><br>Basement: file sketches, mop, call window guy, see project notebook<br><br>with details, sketches, info and other tasks and subtasks in the project notebook.<br><br>Does anyone have any suggestions for getting my list whittled down?  These strategies feel like cheating, somehow, but I'm uncertain how to get to a list that I can trust without whittling away the safety nets, bonehead ideas and sheer bulk of tasks.<br><br>A lot of the answers I've seen on the forum have been 'follow the system as described' and when I've seen how to do that, it worked well.  But are the strategies above within the system or not? Or are the just further tweaks that will make it harder for the system to evolve?<br><br>Thanks in advance for any ideas!<br><br>Sally R<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Sally, and welcome aboard!<br><br>WOW - 52 pages is ALOT of pages in my book - no pun intended.   :-)  <br><br>In your case, I would do as Mark has suggested to others, and that is start anew, write down your 5 or so tasks and let the list grow organically.  Or do like I did and dismiss like crazy.  The problem with that is that you'll probably end up with a lot of bigger, ugly tasks on your lists that you still really want to get done.  My problem wasn't big, ugly tasks, it was the sheer volume of projects I was trying to start all at once.  If that is your problem, you could just dismiss whole projects.  <br><br>Personally, I don't put "fluff" tasks on my list.  What I have done (when I'm not motivated), and used for years is: <br>- do task on list<br>- do fun "fluff" thing - NOT on list (timed or blocked if necessary, like reading 1 chapter)<br>- repeat....<br><br>The only way that I know how - that works within AF - to keep on top of things you think will slip through the cracks - is to deliberately keep your number of pages down to a level that works for you.  For instance, if you have 12 active pages, you work on your list about 4 hours a day and your average time for doing tasks is about 20 minutes, once a day you'll revisit every one of those pages (if you were only doing one item per page).  Nothing can fall through the cracks that way.   If you were really concerned that something would fall through the cracks, that's what a daytimer is for, I think.  I don't use one anymore, I use my blackberry - but most people do.  Once you get to the point where you're tempted to tweak, you've probably got too many pages and it's time to look critically again at what you want to do with your life in the next xx number of days. <br><br>This is just my personal preference, but when a bill comes in, if it isn't due for awhile (which they usually aren't), I'll write it down on the list.  I know I'll come to it in the next week for sure, probably in the next couple of days.  But that's because my list is usually fairly small now.<br><br>Otherwise, yeah, I think what you're doing with the projects and the yes/no stuff is kind of cheating - although it is kind of funny.  :-)   BUT if you sorted 5 books in rainbow order and re-entered the task, that would make sense.  When you decide not to do something, you are just cancelling or dismissing it in my mind.  I've unconsciously created a few duplicates here and there (take out garbage comes to mind), but never deliberately.  I just leave the duplicate on there for the next weeks pickup and don't re-enter it.  <br><br>We can't all expect to be mini-Marks right out of the gate.  He's been doing this stuff for years and probably has a lot more self-discipline and a lot less monkey mind than any of us.  You'll get there, it just takes time and practice to find your sweet spot / time management nirvana.<br><br>All the best, and I hope you stick around!</div>

<div class="content">Welcome to the forum, Sally R.   I loved your entry "look for urgent items on the list and do them" - a very creative use of AF, but maybe putting it on every page is taking it too far.  Like some of the UK's members of parliament who've been exposed for milking the expenses and allowances system, you've obeyed the letter of the law but maybe not the spirit.  I love the fact that you can put whatever you like in AF - that's one of its greatest strengths - and if it works for you, that's brilliant.<br><br>Jacqueline, I loved your comment: "We can't all expect to be mini-Marks right out of the gate. He's been doing this stuff for years and probably has a lot more self-discipline and a lot less monkey mind than any of us. "   If I remember correctly,  Mark has said in one of his books that it was precisely because he struggled with lack of self-discipline, procrastination, etc. that he took such a keen interest in time management matters, and that people who didn't struggle with such issues probably didn't need to be reading a book on time management.  So he knows exactly where we're coming from.   <br><br>Mark, it would be interesting to know if you've totally conquered your time management problems by using AF, or whether you still have time management problems but find that AF has made them more manageable.  <br><br>Cheers also to all our regular contributors - it's great to hear your experiences.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Sally,<br><br>I'll probably comment more later but just quickly ...<br><br>As to your first point, try this:  if you have multiple tasks like "pay bills", don't bother about crossing it off ... that just wastes time.  Do it the first time you see it and cross that one off.  Then when you finally come to the other instances, as you work the list, you will remember that you did them and cross them off then.  No sweat if they live there for a while.  They don't eat much!  ;-)<br><br>OH, and if your list is huge and it takes you a long time to get around the circuit, you might just need to pay bills again when you see one of the earlier instances!  ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Sally,<br><br>I've got another small time splinter here so ;-)<br><br>Personally, I dismiss tasks whenever I realize I'll not do them.  I don't wait until the page is complete ... if I'm not going to do it, then it should not be on the list.  This even applies to things I know I want to do but realize that there is no way I'm going to get to them in the reasonable future.  Out they go.<br><br>The converse is when I should (by the rules) dismiss something but don't want to.  Then I take some small action and cycle it to the end, as per the rule.  Sometimes I can close a few pages by just doing those two things.<br><br>If you have 52 open pages you are probably not dismissing enough and should start doing so with a vengeance ;-)  To fix this, I would (personally) pick an almost complete page and close it ... one way or another right now.  Take actions on the open items and cycle them or dismiss the page.  Just do it now.  If you did that only once a day, you'd be down to a reasonable number of pages in a couple of weeks or so.  Then just keep focused on dismissing and closing pages as per the rules.</div>

<div class="content">Thank you so much for your replies!  <br><br>More later -- "solve morning glare on computer screen" is probably on page 5 :p  <br><br>I think I will attack with Jacqueline and Mike's "dismiss like crazy" (and with a vengeance) today, then come back and reread these replies when I can actually see my screen (dang eastern exposure).<br><br>Sally (much encouraged)</div>

<div class="content">I agree that Mark knows where we're coming from - but I don't think he started AF with the backlog of 'tolerations' that some of us had built up pre-AF - that we somehow think we can get away with dumping into the system without having it crash.  I think it makes a huge difference to the AF experience, where it wouldn't in a system like DIT.</div>

<div class="content">What does "sorting books in rainbow order" mean please? <br><br>I must have skipped school the day that was taught and I've never heard it before! Can't even imagine what it might be, unless it's literally sorting by cover colour. <br><br>Please elucidate me. Who knows? - perhaps it's the definitive missing piece in my whole organisational jigsaw!</div>

<div class="content">RE: gaming the system by consolidating individual project tasks into a single project task, and putting all the individual details into a project folder...<br><br>I do that all the time, and find it's very effective.  <br><br>Usually the project folder is really an Outlook folder with all my unactioned emails (including emails to myself with more tasks).<br><br>But sometimes it's a regular manilla folder with a bunch of scribbled pages.<br><br>Sometimes it's a large sticky in the back of my AF notebook, with a list of "stuff to do outside" or "errands to do in town".<br><br><br>For me, it works like this:<br><br>- I have a thought about some task I need to do, and write it on my AF list<br>- I am in a meeting and receive an Action Item -- I just add it directly to my AF list<br>- I get an email and realize I need to take some action, so I put it on my AF list<br><br>then, as I process my list, and come across these items, sometimes I get "stuck" on them, because <br><br>- there are other dependencies, and I realize they are part of a larger project<br>- I want to do the task, but realize there are other related tasks I must do first -- usually all of those tasks are part of some project<br>- they are hard to process, because they fit into a larger overall scheme, and I want to process them together with other items -- in other words, they are part of a larger project<br>- etc.<br><br>So, I then throw the item into the project folder (creating a new project folder if needed), write the name of the project at the end my AF list, and cross off the original item from the list.<br><br>This is very natural and works very well for me.   I don't think it's "gaming the system" at all. <br><br>(But I do agree that adding items to the list multiple times on purpose so I would have several instances available -- which I used to do myself -- and the other "tricks" you mention, ARE gaming the system to some degree, and I eventually stopped doing those things since it's more effective NOT doing it.)</div>

<div class="content">It seems that what will end up happening if you do put things on multiple times (because it seems that everyone who does that ends up with a ton of active pages), is that it delays that point when you have to deal with the bigger, uglier things.  So you could end up with a lot of pages at the older stage that have these big, ugly tasks.  Just a thought...</div>

<div class="content">I'm with Seraphim - I don't think grouping tasks into project lists is gaming the system. One big advantage (apart from the main advantage of shrinking your list) is that it changes the dynamics of dismissal: You don't often have that dilemma where a task comes up which you really don't want to do - and which should be dismissed - but you don't want to dismiss it as it's an important future step in a project you *do* want to do. Instead, you only ever dismiss entire projects which you decide you don't want to do - which is a different kind of decision entirely.<br><br>I have struggled to find a nice way of working off project lists in an 'AF way', and still retain the original benefits of the system. I've done a separate post on my personal approach to this - essentially I use the end of the AF list as a 'scratch-pad' while working on projects.</div>

<div class="content">I've taken to working just about ANY list as though it's an AF list—at least mentally.<br><br>E.g., clearing out my email in box.  I don't empty my whole in box all at once any more.  When I come across "In box" in my main AF list, I set the kitchen timer for 5 or 10 minutes, maybe more, and then start processing.  Most emails are quickly processed—delete, quick reply, or quickly scan and then throw into a project folder for later detailed processing in context with the rest of the project.  After clearing these things quickly, I am then left with other emails that are harder to categorize and don't seem like they can just be deleted.  So, I go through those in "AF" style, and deal with whatever "stands out".  Something might sit there for a few days without standing out, in which case it usually gets deleted or archived.  But most items get actioned within a few days.<br><br>Same with project folders.  In Outlook, I use the colored flags to indicate action is required—<br>- red means I need to take action<br>- blue means I'm waiting for someone else<br>- orange means action but "maybe later"<br>- purple means "info to keep for reference, no action required"<br><br>So, when I come across "Project X" in my AF list, I go look in the "Project X" Outlook folder, and process the flagged items in an AF manner, looking for things that "stand out", focusing on the reds and blues.  There's always *something* I can work on, for a few minutes at least.  Usually I'm in there for longer, spending a good amount of time working on the project, and then go back to my main AF list to see what's next.  Occasionally there's actually nothing to do, which is great, it means I totally up-to-date with that project.<br><br>Processing my in box and project folders in this way has the same psychological effect as processing my AF list—frequent, repeated exposure to each item breaks down resistance.   It's been very effective for me.</div>

<div class="content">Thank you again for all your thoughtful replies!  You were all very right about the dismissal issue; I had been resisting dismissing items, but now that I've started it's gotten much easier (and I'm finding Mike's advice to dismiss sooner helps tremendously).<br><br>Seraphim and Ed's confirmation that consolidating projects is within the spirit of AF has helped a lot - between that and following Jacqueline's policy of keeping fluff off the list, I'm starting to feel much less overwhelmed - and I think I will be able to get the list down to a much more manageable size in short order.<br><br>I do think a key element is what Jacqueline said about having too many projects.  I had basically dumped every project and idea I'd had in the last ten years onto the list - dismissing all but my ten or twenty most treasured projects really makes a difference.<br><br>Robina, I must admit that it is exactly sorting by the color of the cover... I sort by topic into bookshelves and rooms, but within a shelf I'll arrange them by cover.  I can never find books by title or author anyway, and this way, at least they look pretty.<br><br>I really feel that I'm on the track to getting the list into that self correcting state that will make it optimal.  Thanks again!!<br><br>Sally R</div>

<div class="content">Hi Sally, <br><br>I think that once we get really rolling with AF and realize "wow, I really do finish things!", there isn't the urgency to put everything down that there may have been before.  We realize we will get to those projects eventually, but we need to have completion on some projects before taking these others on - and that's okay.  Most people (even someone like Richard Branson) can't keep 100 plates spinning without some falling.  I'd rather keep 5 plates spinning and keep them going than 20 and have them crashing all over.  <br>And it gives us the opportunity to recognize that those projects could be something we wanted to do 10 yers ago, but don't fit our lives today.  <br><br>I'm so glad you're feeling better about the process.   Personally, I think dismissal is great!  All you're doing is clarifying to yourself what is important to you right now.  And clarity is a huge step.  All the best!<br><br>.</div>

<div class="content">Sally,<br><br>You know, sorting books by color is not so nutty as it might seem to some.  The advantage is that to find a book you have to browse and in doing so, you stumble upon other things of interest that you might not if you had been able to put your hand right on the title.<br><br>I say: Go for it ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Sally for your clarification of "sorting books in rainbow order", i.e: <br>"......I must admit that it is exactly sorting by the color of the cover... I sort by topic into bookshelves and rooms, but within a shelf I'll arrange them by cover. I can never find books by title or author anyway, and this way, at least they look pretty."<br><br>I agree with Mike that, like any locating system that isn't rigidly structured or controlled, there always remains the possibility of unexpected surprises - just like coming across long forgotten money notes (bills to you US folks) or other treasures when looking for mislaid items.<br><br>Your rainbow system has really got me thinking as I often recall a book visually by its spine but this is often difficult to locate within a large number and variety of different spine covers. Ordered by colour would probably make that easier. On a deadline at the moment so I can't afford even to experiment but I sense it could be successful for me.<br><br>I have a big project to put into my AF system: putting in order my 1500+ books so that I can find them and not duplicate purchases if I'm not sure if I've already got a copy! Like you I have different topics allocated in different rooms but still need to sort within those topics.<br><br>I have tried Mark's suggestion of putting back the latest always to the left hand side so I get a 'sense' of where each is according to how long ago I last handled it, but this system doesn't work due to the large number of books. Besides your approach is more aesthetic and maybe appeals to further parts of the brain......   Thanks again!</div>

<div class="content">Robina,<br><br>I guess it is a fairly obvious one, but I catalog my books first by subject, then by sub area within that subject then I tend to put associated books near one another, finally by author if I get that far.  I tend to have books of the same subject in the same book case.<br><br>So I have one bookcase for "productivity" type books, for example.  Within that I have all of the books on time management together.  Within that I have books about procrastination together.<br><br>Another bookcase is for travel and I have it arranged by area of the world (like Asia) then country within that.  One glitch is book size.  Sometimes a book is larger so goes on the bottom shelf while the smaller paperback go on smaller upper shelves.  So there I have to duplicate the ordering.  I guess I just remember what size the book is.<br><br>One of the features of this system is that I can quickly locate a book because I know what it is about ... or I'd not be looking for it in the first place ;-)  Then it has to be "arround" some dozen or so books on similar subjects.  I also get the serendipity factor in that I'll often go looking for a book on Phobias, perhaps, and remember that I have one written by Dr. X.  So I go to the book case of psychology books, then to abnormal psychology, then start browsing for Dr. X's book and find other books treating the subject that I'd forgotten about.  It works well.<br><br>I need this kind of system because I have a few thousand volumes in my library and I'd go mad if I did not have some kind of system.  I think it is time to start downsizing, though.  I doubt that I'll ever get back to some of those books and we are looking to move in the next couple of years or so.  It costs a bunch to move books!!!<br><br>Oh, one more "feature" of this system that I've noticed.  I find that the ordering of my books changes when I go through a bookcase to straighten up.  How I sequence them (by similarity, for want of a better name for this system) depends on how I think about the books and that changes over time.</div>
