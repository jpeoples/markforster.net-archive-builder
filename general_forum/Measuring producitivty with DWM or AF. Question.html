<div class="content">As a solopreneur, I find it difficult to gauge how well I'm performing. When I worked for 'the man", my monthly/annual appraisals were somewhat helpful. If nothing else, the threat of a negative review, assured a degree of responsibility. <br><br>Some of you - particularly Mark - monitor tasks completed and added. I find this ood. How does completing, or adding, menial tasks throughout the day any measure of productivity? <br><br>Looking for suggestions.</div>

<div class="content">My main reasons to use DWM is to increase the time I spend on tasks and out of that time the time I spend on essential tasks. So I use two metrics:<br><br>1) Percent of time spent working vs not working (writing this post, e.g. ;) )<br>2) Percent ot time spent working on essential tasks vs inessential.<br><br>I have this tracked in Excel, I can go into detail on how I do it if you or anyone else is interested...</div>

<div class="content">I use excel formulas to track start, stop and elapsed time for both DWM tasks and breaks. I do not track "essential" tasks until the end of the day, when I label completed tasks as essential or not and see what that percentage is.</div>
