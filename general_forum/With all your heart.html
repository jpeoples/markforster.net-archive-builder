<div class="content">I found this in Mark's old article collection and it seems excellent to me. <br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/wholehearted-living/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/wholehearted-living/</a><br><br>Basically, don't accept any duties unless you are able to put your whole heart into it. Sounds to me like a recipe for making the most of life: most enjoyable, least overburdened, most energetic. It also fits this bit of biblical wisdom:<br><br>"And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;" Colossians 3:23</div>

<div class="content">I really find this notion tickles my fancy.  It matches well the stand-out principle.  It's a guideline for which things to work on.  It suppose it suits the Dreams book, though that didn't appeal to me.  It is a recipe for excellence.<br><br>What seems to happen when I adopt this mindset, is those things I didn't really want to do, I now say I won't do them as set out.  <br><br>But some things demand my attention even though I'm not enthusiastic.  I think here that simply by insisting on the whole-hearted attitude, and simultaneously acknowledging the reason for the needed task, I can actually find an approach such tasks which provides the stipulated heartiness.  It's only been a day but it feels amazing.</div>
