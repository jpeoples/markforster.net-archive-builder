<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br> I am seeking a little clarification on dealing with projects that do not have a deadline (also described here as organizational projects) within DIT. On one hand, my understanding is that a useful DIT approach is to start projects as early as possible, little and often so they do not become urgent. I find this approach useful, particularly with  projects that have a specific, or assumed, deadline.<br><br>On the other hand, I also find that having too many balls to juggle dilutes my abilty to focus and slows tangible results. It can also result in an overwhelming will do list that may need auditing regularly. With this in mind, I find the one-at-a-time approach useful for projects that do not have a deadline. <br><br>Do you feel a one-at-a-time approach to projects without a deadline is compatible with DIT? Or do you recommend starting every project that you have committed pretty much straight away?</div>

<div class="content">Leon:<br><br>My recommendation has always been that projects with deadlines should be dealt with as soon as received, using the "little and often" approach so that you make the most of the time available, while projects without deadlines should be dealt with one at a time - preferably by making them the Current Initiative in turn.</div>

<div class="content">Thank you Mark. I get a lot of benefit from being able to verbalise and work out solutions re DIT on this Forum.</div>
