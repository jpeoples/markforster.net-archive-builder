<div class="content">There are all sorts of ways by which I keep the list short (or try to!). I think frequent weeding is necessary and also not letting myself add similar tasks to the ones I've got already. For instance, I only allow myself to have one video/DVD on the list at a time and one book (or perhaps one fiction and one non-fiction book). This is important for a serial non-finisher of books like myself.<br><br>In general my rule is not to add anything to the list which will detract from the things I have already committed to. This is a pretty good rule whatever system you are following.<br><br>As for "blogs", "finance", etc. I already know which blogs I read and what daily financial actions I take - there's no need for a list. Anything one does regularly quickly develops into a routine if you let it. And yes, I use project lists when needed.<br><br>A simple method for keeping the list weeded would be to say that whenever the list rises to, say, 80 tasks you weed it back to 60 (figures given purely for example). Another would be to say that whenever there are tasks on the list which are more than, say, 3 days old you have to weed the whole list by the number of tasks that are over that age. With a random system that would be better than just chucking the old tasks, as it's no fault of the tasks that the randomizer hasn't picked them.</div>

<div class="content">I have found that using the random method my list naturally shrank to less than two pages and has stabilised there. I can't get it over two pages without forcing lots of new projects on to it. My list has never been this short with any other method, and there is so little overhead.<br><br>I keep a separate list of projects, and pick a new one for the random list when I feel there is room for it, usually when I complete a project or can't move any further for a few days on a project (in which case I remove it from the random list).</div>

When it's time for "dismissal", you'd presumably seen the tasks many times already, and still taken no action.  Thus "dismissal" was the automatic weeding-out function.   Randomizer doesn't seem to have a built-in percolation effect.   It's either "do or delete".   I guess I'll just keep working with it, and see how these things work out in practice.</div>
