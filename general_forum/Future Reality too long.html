<div class="content">My future reality is comprehensive and I feel that it's too long. But whenever I try to shorten it, I end up losing the feelings attached to the pieces I have shortened. Mark says that Dreams colonizes our life one area at a time, and while I have found one area to be more important than the others, in the two weeks I've been doing this, I find that *all* the areas have had some movement towards the future reality. So it feels like the vision, in *all* its parts, is working to pull me towards it. Nonetheless, it also feels really long and I wonder if that will impact its sustainability.<br><br>Today I put subheadings on the different parts of my future reality. Each subsection has 1-3 sentences.: <br>- scholarship<br>- energy and health<br>- meeting commitments<br>- ordered environment<br>- relationships<br>- home<br>- art<br>- Austria (has to do with spending summers in my homeland)<br><br>My understandings is that we zoom in and out of various parts of our future reality, using the goal achievement method. So I'm not sure if I've put stuff into my future reality vision that belongs better in goals.<br><br>Is anyone else encountering this? Are there problems with having too lengthy a future reality?</div>

<div class="content"><<Is anyone else encountering this? Are there problems with having too lengthy a future reality? >><br><br>Yes... but I worry about everything ;) I record (audio) my future/present reality, and i wonder if they're too long, short, not enough feeling, or too much forced feeling, etc., etc. In the end, I trust that the process (according to Dreams), is one part mindfulness (the exercises we're doing) and one part unconscious. And that I'll get there (goals, dreams) somehow.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, @avrum. I saw Mark's new blog post about how his vision has shifted from May 27 to June 12 and noticed that he went from a shorter future vision to one that included more specifics. So maybe it's part of the zooming in and zooming out process</div>

<div class="content">Inexperienced suggestion: don't worry about form, length, or content. Just write what you feel each day, and adjust accordingly. If it feels clumsy, write shorter. If it feels too vague, write compelling details. If it feels overwhelming, write something that feels more even-whelmed.</div>

<div class="content">Basically I agree with Alan. But I think it's best to amend the previous day's version, rather than write it out from scratch each day - this gives a degree of stability which is important if you are going to progress in a reasonably consistent manner.</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br>Can you please clarify your current statement: <br><br><<I think it's best to amend the previous day's version, rather than write it out from scratch each day>><br><br>with this one:<br><br><<it is very powerful to re-type and revise my Future Reality first thing every morning>><br><br>Do you re-type, without looking at your previous days future vision? Do you re-type while looking/reading your previous days future vision? I'm assuming amendments happen based on how you're feeling that morning. <br><br><<this gives a degree of stability which is important if you are going to progress in a reasonably consistent manner. >><br><br>This is something i'm NOT getting with audio recording. And it's a problem. I'm going to start typing out my future vision in the morning, and recording my present reality. I'm already feeling the PULL for this change :)</div>

<div class="content">avrum:<br><br>The idea is that you copy type the previous day's. You can make minor amendments as you type, but when you've finished you should read it through to see if it needs revising. At the moment I'm only making slight changes in emphasis - the basic vision is pretty stable.</div>

<div class="content">An update, for what it's worth:<br><br>I am back to every-morning revisions of my Future Vision and Present Reality. I open the text file containing them, and then I open a new blank window right alongside. Looking at the "real" file, I manually retype it into the blank window. After each paragraph, I stop to review and revise. When finished, I "Select All" in the new window and copy/paste into the "real" file.<br><br>This process feels comfortable enough now, though I sometimes have to use "just get the folder out" to make it happen instead of rushing off to do the day's work. I've been very happy with my vision's content, and just yesterday it got a big overhaul which has me beaming!<br><br>Earlier, in some other thread, I reported having a 2500-word vision. Umm, that was actually 2500 characters. Characters!! I had misread a cryptic display in my editor. My current version is at 140 words (Words!) and looks to be about 40% of its former size.</div>

<div class="content">Here's my latest version of FR: <br><br>I wake up in the morning and ask myself one question: How can my day become an adventure? What risk can I take as  a Jew, therapist, artist, husband/father? At night, I reflect on, and document, which risks were taken. <br><br>I have partners for all of my major projects, providing me with accountability, companionship, and motivation.</div>
