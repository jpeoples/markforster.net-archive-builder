<div class="content">Hey avrum, good for you taking this initiative. The design is nice and though nothing like I would find useful, it's great benefit for you to find your own way. <br><br>Cheers!</div>

<div class="content">"find your own way"<br><br>This is so important - in life and in planner/systems. <br><br>Working with well known systems i.e. 7 Habits, DWM, etc., was instrumental to knowing what worked (and what didn't) for my needs/interests.</div>

<div class="content">Great post, this illustrates we should be experimenting and designing systems that work for us and solve our time and life management issues.  Avrum's system is unique and no other person could have come up with it.  Unfortunately, when people seek time management systems the first thing most do is go for an off the shelf system and that is why many do not stick, because they do not solve the individuals problem.  <br><br>Thanks for sharing this.<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">Hi Gerry. <br><br><<the first thing most do is go for an off the shelf system and that is why many do not stick, because they do not solve the individuals problem. >><br><br>The hyperbole that accompanies each system i.e. "Mind like water", is very seductive. The idea that one system will reduce the stress in our lives, improve our productivity and cure acne is very inciting. I have fallen victim to this many times.</div>
