<div class="content">Norman, it seems to me there is only one good way to achieve this and that is to use an opposing task. From a psychological standpoint, if we try to eliminate a habit without replacing it with a positive one, we're in trouble. So, for example, if you want to stop drinking Red Bull, you would add the task, "Drink a glass of water." If you want to do this several times a day, you either need a shorter AF list that will have you on the last page for a while or you could add it to every page or you could use a list modification such as has been discussed on the forum (Andreas's approach, always starting with the last page, etc.). An alternative task you could add would be to review your list of reasons for giving up your bad habit. Or why not choose both?</div>

<div class="content">What Mel said, PLUS:<br><br>Make a list of all of the things you will do with the TONS of money you'll have if you stop drinking Red Bull!  ROTF ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Norman:<br><br>For the example you quote I would put "Drink can of Red Bull" on your AF list and make it a rule that you can only drink Red Bull when the task stands out in accordance with the normal AF rules.</div>

<div class="content">And of course, once you'v been using AF for a few days you'll realise you're flying anyway - so who needs Red Bull!!! :-)</div>

<div class="content">Norman, you've brought up a good point.  I should use this to keep me off the addiction of a certain forum... :-)</div>
