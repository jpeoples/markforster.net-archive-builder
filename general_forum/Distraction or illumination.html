<div class="content">Distractions are often regarded as enemies to be beaten back and lots of willpower used to squash them and get on.<br><br>An alternative view is that anything that impedes the process you are engaged in is there in order to expand your awareness. Whatever comes in to awareness needs to be there in order for you to be more aware of this part of you. When it is redefined as illumination you become more aware. You don't need to act on it, but it helps to notice it and accept it.</div>

<div class="content">Anything can be described from any perspective, if you observe it in a merely one-dimensional way.</div>

<div class="content">Yes Christopher, but which perspective is more useful?  This notion of fighting distraction vs. acknowledging extra inputs can be helpful.  If you consider that what distracts you is doing so for a reason, then you think more productively about how to best accommodate that reason.  <br><br>I think this can lead to actually eliminating the distraction as a distraction.  You might incorporate the thing into your flow, find a substitute that suits your main course, or change your environment or yourself so that the distraction is no longer present but set aside for another more suitable time and place.</div>

<div class="content">This reminds me of Cal Newport's idea that procrastination is not simply a bad habit, but should be taken as a warning sign that something is amiss:  either the task you are procrastinating on isn't the right task, or it's not defined well, or there are other unresolved issues in the back of your mind.   So, when you find yourself procrastinating, don't just beat yourself up about it, but try to identify the deeper cause.   <br><br><a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/2011/07/15/how-to-cure-deep-procrastination/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://calnewport.com/blog/2011/07/15/how-to-cure-deep-procrastination/</a><br><a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/2008/07/14/monday-master-class-stop-procrastinating-by-making-it-easier-to-procrastinate/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://calnewport.com/blog/2008/07/14/monday-master-class-stop-procrastinating-by-making-it-easier-to-procrastinate/</a><br><br>Perhaps one can view distractions the same way: they are a signal of an underlying problem.</div>

<div class="content">Perhaps Mark's "Diceman" experiments thoughts and my "Distractions as illuminations"  are ways of equalizing expectation. <br><br>We get so caught up in what we expect to be doing that we need ways of pausing in order to be aware of alternate possibilities - a way to access alternatives to our current internal information (as well as the external items on the AF list)  so as to be aware of additional probabilities that would be more fulfilling. We tend to follow our most dominant thought, tend to expect to be doing one thing and not another, and this can get in the way of following the path of most excitement, so a way of equalising expectations can be useful.</div>

<div class="content">This reminds me of meditation. You accept, without judgement, that your mind has wandered, and gently bring it back. Or, in other forms, you change your focus to the thing that distracted you.<br><br>In some types of body scanning, you focus your awareness on a spot of discomfort and accept what is, which often reduces the involvement of surrounding tissues, as well as the emotional component of the pain.<br><br>The key, based on only a few weeks of research, is not judging the distraction.</div>

<div class="content">A lot must depend on the nature of the distraction, is it an original creative or business idea, or the *far* more common caffeine/interwebz inspired 'shiny idea' ;-)<br><br>If the latter then it's be better to shunt it into a siding for now. I usually have an all important 'other' category on paper for these, which can grow like topsy throughout the day, then I can review and choose a promising few at the end.</div>

<div class="content">Michael,<br><br>This reminds me of C.S. Lewis' aversion to typewriters and fountain pens. He never used a typewriter but did try fountain pens for a few years. He went back to dip pens, however, because he discovered a rhythm in writing, a pause that was needed. The dip pen provided this; actually forced this. The pause allowed him to reflect and prepare.</div>

<div class="content">I became conscious some years back that the times when I'd actually succeeded in creating something really original and important (to me at least) came out of times of deep procrastination. <br><br>In fact I've even experimented with just allowing procrastination to run and refusing to worry about it. The problem I found though was that not worrying about it removed the creativity!</div>

He said words to the effect of "Don't pray for distractions to be removed. The things which are distracting you are the things that you need to be praying about."</div>

<div class="content">Cricket:<br><br><< In some types of body scanning, you focus your awareness on a spot of discomfort and accept what is, which often reduces the involvement of surrounding tissues, as well as the emotional component of the pain. >><br><br>A form of stretching which I've always found effective (I can't remember where I learnt it) is to move your body until you feel a moderate discomfort or stiffness. Then stop moving and just focus on the discomfort until it eases. You may need to move back and forth a bit to follow where the discomfort goes. Once you've cleared it completely carry on moving until you come to the next discomfort spot.</div>

<div class="content">I like that form of stretching, although you describe it in a more relaxed and accepting way, or maybe I'm reading it that way because it's beside meditation. I'm tempted to tell the stiff part to hurry up so I can move on. Not so much today, so maybe the meditation is working.</div>

<div class="content">I wonder how the part of mind that creates distraction can be used to generate more interesting and satisfying options that would not have entered awareness if the expected / insisted-on route is taken?</div>
