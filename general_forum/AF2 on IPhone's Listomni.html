<div class="content">I have explored the use of many different IPhone apps for AF1 and 2 and am convinced that apart from the lack of a desktop app and syncing (you email backups and the syncing is coming this summer), Listomni is the most functional for AF in my opinion. I have shared screenshots and a little about how I use it here. I do keep the most recent items on top but you can choose whether to sort up or down on creation date. At only $6.99 Listomni is a bargain. I am not affiliated with them<br>but wish I were. Lol.<br><br><a href="http://m.flickr.com/#/photos/28734468@N06/3675925553/" rel="nofollow">http://m.flickr.com/#/photos/28734468@N06/3675925553/</a><br><br><a href="http://m.flickr.com/#/photos/28734468@N06/3675941555/" rel="nofollow">http://m.flickr.com/#/photos/28734468@N06/3675941555/</a><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Very good, Mel. Looks awfully a lot like what I did with CarbonFin Outliner (described in the tech implementation thread). I really like what you did with the reading list (i.e. creating a separate "read only" AF list and putting "Read" in the main AF list). In my current setting, 2/3 of my list is taken by various books and articles that I'm currently reading. Needless to say, some of them tend to go back to the beginning (or the end in your case) of the list. Putting them in the main list gives me "the fear of dismissal," forcing me to tackle them: Yesterday, I had to read 4 books (in a 15 min. burst each) at the end of the day, as I knew I couldn't dismiss them.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for posting this. I just downloaded Listomni. Quick question which I can't seem to find the answer to. . . How do you have an item automatically added to the top of the list on creation?</div>

<div class="content">Curious... how do you handle items that need to be reentered? I'm assuming you copy/paste. A bit of a pain on the iPhone, huh? I was so excited to have this feature, but I find the day to day use to be an exercise in finger dexterity.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for posting those, Mel. Like Avrum, the lack of a desktop app is a dealbreaker for me. When you say syncing is coming this summer, does that mean they're releasing a desktop app?</div>

<div class="meta">2009-07-1 2:24</div>
<div class="content">Regarding the re-entering of items, there is a dictionary feature which will offer alternatives when you start typing, so you do not have to type the whole item. A big help.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-07-1 2:55</div>
<div class="content">Chris is right about the dictionary. The automatic task suggestions as you type are so helpful to me that I can't live without them! (And none of the many other apps I've tried has this feature). You can enter large numbers of tasks to Listomni via Google Docs. That's how I got started. Check out Ontomni's website for help with this. Then you can just enter individual tasks on your iPhone on the run. As far as a desktop/web app to go along with it, I don't know the answer to that. The developer just told me that syncing would be available sometime this summer. I am looking forward to that and honestly hope it's a web app as I love being able to enter tasks from any computer. As soon as I know more about it I will post to the forum. <br><br>Cixelsyd, I have gone back and forth on having separate lists of things like books and movies. Having individual items on the main list does force me to "decide" whether I am doing them or not. This is a great method of determining what to declutter from your house, too! But unfortunately for me, my list quickly gets out of control with this approach and adds to my anxiety. If there is an item that needs to be addressed soon, it will go on my main list and not my adjunct list. I will also begin using dismissal criteria for the adjunct lists if they get too long or my bookshelves get too full. :-)</div>

<div class="content">Interesting. For AF, I have little need for computer: iPhone is plenty sufficient once the initial setup was done, especially with 3.0 allowing us to use the horizontal keyboard mode. To each his/her own.<br><br>I must admit I was tempted by Listomni, as I will be undoubtedly tempted by TaskPaper once the iPhone app becomes available. Listomni is a sophisticated program that tickles my technolust. However, I have resisted it (for now). I am sticking with my simple outliner implementation (SOI, a French word for "self," for short). It is the closest thing to the pen-and-paper AF with all its advantages. Why don't we all take the "July challenge" to see if we are still using our tool at the end of the month? The test of time will reveal the tool's usability.</div>

<div class="content">>> iPhone is plenty sufficient once the initial setup was done >><br><br>Not for me. I drag emails onto taskpaper (creating a link), allowing me to file the email and keep my inbox empty. As well, some tasks require notes (much easier to create on a computer then an iPhone). And when a task needs to be reentered for further processing, copy/paste on a computer is much, much easier than an iPhone. Alas, it still would be convenient to have TaskPaper sync to a TaskPaper app. <br></div>

<div class="content">Mel,<br><br>I'm fussing with Listomni right now.  Have you implemented AF4 in it?  I can probably figure something out, but how did you set up your open and closed lists?  And pages, if you did that.  I might to keep it in sync with my paper system.  Thanks for any info.</div>

<div class="content">I'm blissfully happy with OmniFocus, both the computer app and the iPhone app and I'm using them for AF4. I love 1) the clean, elegant interface and 2) the syncing via MobileMe. <br><br>I didn't want to move from a paper list, but after several months I had to acknowledge that  there were just too many times when the notebook containing my list (Circa pages) was "there" and I was "here". I work in two classrooms which are widely separated, and in my studio, and at home, and go to meetings all over and there is just a limit on what I am willing to carry around.<br><br>But, I almost always have my laptop and I always have my iPhone, so now my list is always accessible. I find that (surprisingly) calming. And, I'm not going through the ridiculous exercise of making motes on my phone and emailing them to myself to "add to Aufofocus list".<br><br>I understand that OmniFocus is expensive, but I bought it with a substantial educational discount.<br><br>For me, it was money well spent. OmniFocus is the second best thing I've done to manage my time and my work. The best thing, of course, is Autofocus!</div>

<div class="content">Mike, sorry for the long delay. I've been off the forum for quite a while. I haven't used Listomni for AF4 although I still use it for many of my list-making needs. It's my shopping list, gift list, book list, movie list, packing list app and more. When I was using it for AF, I used categories as pages. For a long time I used "Last page" as my last page and then quickly multi-edited the tasks to move them to a numbered page, leaving my "Last page" blank. The app that I tested for Tony that should be available via the app store soon is amazing for AF. I think you'd love it! Listomni is a phenomenal app and can be used very well for AF, but FocusPad will be the BEST. What's been going on with you?</div>

<div class="meta">2009-09-25 22:06</div>
<div class="content">Hi Mel,<br><br>What's been with me?   ;-)  I've just gotten myself an iPhone.  (I think the world is about to topple from it's axis.  If you only knew how much I hate all things Apple!  Yet there it is.)  I have to admit, the power of the phone almost offsets the tyranny of Apple and AT&T that I have to endure.<br><br>I sprung for the $7 for ListOmni based on your raving about it.  (O.K., I did some other research as well.)  I thought of several ways to implement AF4 and discovered that my basic trade-offs are structure vs. searching ability.  I.E. if I put everything in one list I can search more easily but I lose the ability to structure it the way I'd like.<br><br>What I decided was to make the Open and Closed lists two different lists, and do some moving of tasks when it is time to move the line.  (I'm still thinking about that approach.  I could keep them both in the same list and just use a "dummy line" task to divide them.<br><br>I don't know what I'd do if I were not so committed, on principle, to paper.  That being the case I need to keep any electronic implementation synchronized to my paper book.  That forces me find some way to impose a page structure on the ListOmni implementation.<br><br>Having some really bad "sorting experiences" ;-) I elected to protect myself by using a structure of PP-LL (for page number and line number) as part of the task name.  I wish I did not have to do that, but it works and is not a terrible problem for me.<br><br>So I have an Open and Closed list with tasks mirroring my paper notebook.  I enter tasks in the paper book, work them from the paper book (mostly), and catch up my ListOmni list periodically.  So far all it has done for me is let me do some organizing of the tasks to get a handle on things.  IOW, I can quickly group errands or books I want when I'm online on Amazon, etc.  Another nice feature is the ability to make completed task "disapear" ... it is very uncluttered that way.  It is nice to have as an additional tool.  It is still not as fast as paper so I still can't see switching to it as a primary tool.<br><br>So that is where I am now ... playing with my new toy ;-)  I just saw a MindJet application that has me drooling ;-)  But I'm really on a search for some way to manage files so I can keep reference material on the iPhone.  I know I can use Evernote on the iPhone but I have some security and privacy concerns putting some things up on the web.  I'm still chewing on that.</div>

<div class="content">Mike, I feel about HP the way you feel about Apple. For me, Apple is a refreshing change! I'm also incredibly fond of my iPhone. In fact, I love it so much, I may have to give it a middle name. ;-) <br><br>I have to admit you've freaked me out by buying something based on my recommendation. What if I'm wrong and you're out $7???? LOL Actually, Listomni is a superb app. I don't know that it's the best for AF4, particularly after using FocusPad, but it is the best hands down for so many lists. Just to give you a preview, FocusPad allows you to swipe from page to page. I LOVE that and couldn't find any other task apps that permitted it. You can also re-add the tasks and highlight them in different colors for whatever your particular purposes are. The initial price will be set very low, too.<br><br>I use Google Docs as my iPhone reference. You can certainly use apps that allow you to transfer the docs directly to your iPhone, but let me tell you Google Docs saved my hiney last month! I arrived at a speaking engagement without my notes! It was a prop-heavy talk and I'd been so focused on getting those together that I forgot my notes on the table. My dh wasn't home or I would have asked him to drive them out to me. Instead I walked my son through uploading them to Google Docs. I spoke from my iPhone notes! Whew! <br><br>Have you made any more fab desserts lately? I've been having a blast cooking lately. Homemade apple pie. Yum!!</div>

<div class="content">Good Morning Mel,<br><br>Re: HP.  I'm of two minds about them.  I come from a hardware background ... before there were computers ;-)  HP was one of the leaders in electronics... test equipment, medical electronics, research gear, etc.  Their equipment was the best, in terms of usability, design, and quality.  Beyond that, the company was a great place to work (I did not work there, but I knew people who did).  When the economy took a big hit in the '70's, for example, management took deep pay cuts and the company went to a four day work week and no one was laid off.  As for current events, I'm not so sure any more.  I think their printers are pretty good.  :There are no better calculators than the 12C, 16C, etc.  My 12C is about 32 years old now and my first set of batteries just died!!!!  I'm not so sure that their PCs are anything special.  They got a big black eye with that sleazy CEO.  So I dunno.<br><br>So what have you decide the middle name of your iPhone will be?  LOL ;-)<br><br>Ah, see, you don't know your own power ;-)  Yeah, if I'm out $7, I'll have to get a job at the Big Mac Supper Club ;-)<br><br>Focus Pad.  Interesting.  I know that in ListOmni, I hate the behavior that when you are swiping down, screen after screen, to get to something near the bottom, you can accidentally stray too close to the left side of the screen and are taken back to the parent level.  Damn I hate that.  The colors should be nice as well.  I thought that was a big oversight in ListOmni.  The features on some of these iPhone programs seem to be unimaginative, but that may be more the fault of Apple.  They seem to be micromanaging the software development process.  I think things will open up more when jailbreaking becomes more popular.<br><br>I'm glad that they will price it low.  But they really do have to have a "lite" version so we can try it.  And for GOD'S sake don't cripple the basic functions in the light version.  I mean, one guy has an alarm clock out there with no alarm!!!  Just brain dead.  Limit the records or something ... that will allow evaluating function without giving away the store.  Oh, and speaking of alarms ... I've not been able to find a decent program to manage ticklers.  Most of the PIMs don't have good alarm functions so that makes them useless.  They really need to allow tasks to be given due dates/times with an alarm function and flexible advanced notice selection.  I know they can't make this a complete PIM right out of the gate, but task due dates with alarms will multiply its usefulness many times over.<br><br>Documents:  I like Google Docs, but I would like a way to have things on the phone itself.  I can't always be sure to get a connection ... I have AT&T, after all ;-)  I have just downloaded a free app that caches Google docs and lets you view them.  I've not tried it yet ... it had some bad reviews.<br><br>One of the coolest apps I've found is "Trapster".  It notfies you of red light cameras, speed traps and cop hide outs based on your moving map GPS display.  Pretty neat, and useful as well.  But it really brought home the weakness of the iPhone ... they really need to implement multi-tasking.  I mean, what use to have a great app like Trapster, when, while driving, you are apt to really want to be using one of the navigation apps and you can't do both.  It seems obvious that an OS level based "forward" and "back" button, like we are used to in broswers is an obvious need.  But I do love the phone in general.  I love the big screen ... and the camera is pretty good as well.<br><br>Deserts:  LOL ;-)  I seem to have developed a reputation.  No, Summer is over and the ice cream machine is in moth balls.  But I DO make some pretty mean mashed potatoes for Thanksgiving.  But don't even LOOK at them if you are trying to keep the calories under control.  ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Well, Mike, thank you for several good belly laughs this morning!! Let's start with HP. I had to replace the CD/DVD drive on my machine multiple times. The customer service people are out of India. I needn't say more, but I will. Every time I talked to the people, they made me start over like a fool. "Okay, reboot your computer." AGHAGH! The worst was when the guy called me at 11PM and said it. Reboot? I'm in bed!!! I wasn't sure I should plunk down the big bucks for an IMac until I talked to yet another Indian tech who wanted me to spell every word I said. Not kidding. I have had no regrets! <br><br>I am in total agreement with you on Lite versions of apps. No alarm. That's hilarious! I don't know if FocusPad will have a lite version or not, but it's going to be so cheap, it won't need it. I'm also in agreement with you on task alerts. Supposedly Toodledo and ToDo have push alerts now. I haven't used them. I'm trying to keep things as simple as possible. I'm using Google Tasks for my time-sensitive stuff. I love that I can convert my emails to tasks, see them on my calendar, and can check them off. I don't love that they aren't listed with my daily emailed agenda and that I don't get alerts. I looked at NotifyMe last night that has push notifications that you can snooze. I may try that. I don't understand why you can't get the exact features you want in ONE program! Why on earth doesn't Google allow you to get notifcations for tasks? If I weren't avoiding negative language, I'd call that d__b. LOL Do let me know if you find a good solution.<br><br>You are really bringing back memories by talking about Trapster. I had a first date with a guy once who had piles of junk on his passenger seat that he had to move for me to get into the car. He then had to flip on his fuzz buster. I said, "Oh, are we going to be speeding to the restaurant?" LOL During dinner he said, "I don't understand why women are afraid of me. Sure I've busted down a few doors and smashed some furniture, but I've never hit anybody." LOL!!! <br><br>I am so looking forward to Thanksgiving this year. I make the BEST stuffing and a cranberry salad that is to die for. But everyone has different tastes for these things, don't they? Kind of like time management stuff. ;-)</div>

I think if I use ListOmni for AF4 (and my other lists) and then set due dates where appropriate, I can have everything but the alarm.  I just have to check every day to see what is coming up.  Maybe I can come up wiht something better.  <sigh></div>

I don't know if is the app itself or maybe the bullet proof case I got for the phone that is causing me to have low volume.  (The lady at the AT&T store showed me her shattered screen held together with packing tape and that sold me on the rubberized hard plastic thing.  ;-)<br><br>>>>  I haven't had trouble with GCal's alarms, but if I did, I'd probably use the iPhone's calendar. PI is an expensive app so you'd really want to make sure it worked for you. I was excited about it until I downloaded the first version. Complete garbage. It crashed every single time. They appear to have it right now. I'll let you know as I continue using it.  <<< <br><br>Good, I'd appreciate that.  Anything to cut down on my core application set.  All of this is so cobbled together, 'ya know?  Why can't I buy a PIM like they used in STNG?  You know, fits in your hand, weighs an ounce, and all you do is ask it any question you can imagine and it tells you the answer, as well as telling you it is lunch time?  I want one of THOSE ;-)<br><br>>>>  I think my plan is going to be to continue to convert my time-specific emails to Google tasks and use PI for those that I need an additional reminder for. NotifyMe is $2.99 and I just don't want to shell out any more $. That's an unwritten goal of mine now: spend less!  <<<<br><br>An admirable one, to be sure ;-)  (NotifyMe is now $1.99 so maybe that will tempt you, if you have not bought it yet.)<br><br>I just looked at NotifyMe.  It looks good, but the only problem I have with the entire philosophy of these things is that they rely on being connected.  Not a huge problem, to be sure, but sometimes I am in a dead zone, and my connection here at home ... well, the whole house is basically a dead zone.  I don't get why they can't keep it phone based.  Fine, there may be things you do on the web that require push, but why not push to the phone and let the phone manage the alarm when it is time?  Is it some kind of brain dead limitation Apple has on the phone or the developers?  Anyway, I just downloaded the free version to see how it works.  I don't mind springing for $2 if it works reasonably well.<br><br>One thing that gripes me about some of these alarms and such ... they can knock you out of what you are doing in an app.  Yesterday, I was entering a task in ListOmni, a call came in, I answered it, and when I went "back" to ListOmni I had lost my work.  And why does answering a call have to take you "out" of your app?  Come on Apple.  Sheesh.<br><br>>>>  Have you ever tried what I'm doing now--not using a list at all unless there's some sort of deadline?  <<<<br><br>That does not work for me.  I need structure.  I have this ADD thing going on ;-)  If I don't keep on task, I'm likely to look up from what I'm (not) doing to find it is Spring and I'm sitting out on the curb with my furniture because they foreclosed my house! ;-)  LOL ;-)  I really do tend to "drift".  This is one problem that the iPhone has brought to my life ... it is just a whole big basket of new shiny things to chase after.  A veritable box full of squirrels.  Fortunately it has given more than it has taken from my time ... but not by a whole lot ;-)<br><br>I think that the "no list" system works, at least on a basic level, for those who are naturally squared away ... those who "do it now" and all of that kind of thing.  I don't.  If I get a bill in the mail and it is due in two weeks, I throw it in the inbox, thinking I'll process it later, and indeed I may ... or I may bury it with other things and it will be lost forever ... unless I make a note to clear the inbox.  I rely on habits and lists ... and sometimes if I get involved, I don't follow the habit to look at the list and them I'm really lost ;-) ;-) <br><br>You may have read my posts here about habits ... that is because, for me at least, without strong habits I go off the rails.  This is Sunday Morning.  After I catch up with this list (I've already cleared my half dozen email accounts and done my moderator chores on lists I own and manage) I'll go next door and sit with my neighbor and have coffee, chit-chat, talk about who won the Ohio State game yesterday, and work on my weekly review.  If I don't hit that habit I'll not keep my TM systems in order.  I don't find than anything else works for me but habit for that.  I know Mark would put "Review" on his AF list and that would work for him.  For some reason that does not work for me.  (I'd probably start a web search to investigate the etymology of the word "review" LOL ;-)<br><br>AF works for me for a lot of things. But I need to block and schedule time for things that are large or things I'm avoiding.  I need to reorganize the kitchen cabinets ... I've needed to do that for a wile now.  (I've got plastic ware piled next to the kitchen table now ;-)  It is no more than a couple of hours to do it, I have the new plastic shelf liner I'm going to cut and fit after I've vacuumed it all out ... but it seems to not be getting done for some reason.  So it is SCHEDULED for this afternoon.  It will get done today because I tagged it on my AF list with today's date then made a list of what I will do today ... so that it WILL get done.  if I did not do that, I'd likely take my wife out to see a move.  ("Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs", no doubt ;-)<br><br>And that is the other dark side of this whole business ... my wife is a roaring 7 (to my 5) so we feed into each other's procrastination.  It can be pretty crazy ;-)<br><br>So, no, I need a list, unless I'm deep into a project I understand and am enthusiastic about ... then I don't need the structure.  Get me writing a program in an interesting new language, or reading that new book on metaphor that I just got, and I'll go away for hours and hours and ...  ;-)</div>

We’re not! How many times have people on this forum asked about how to use DIT when their boss is constantly demanding things from them TODAY. We may have a way we prefer to work, but what happens when the people we work or live with have a completely different approach that is in conflict with ours?<br>That’s a huge reason why I love working with no list or predetermined agenda (apart from must-do-today stuff). In the past, I would think, “Today I am going to get X, Y, and Z done.

Even though he is so amazing in his productivity and ability to recreate with no angst whatsoever, I felt superior to him. “Sure you can just go to the park. You don’t have 30 AF pages!” Do you see what I’m saying? Yesterday he was all absorbed in closing the pool and it just felt like the right time to tackle the closet. I had no fear that he would present a completely different agenda that would get in my way. ;-) In the past, I’ve tried having little meetings with him to talk about our respective plans for the day/week. With his no-list approach, you can imagine how effective that was. LOL! Come to think of it, our financial management approach has been the same. I’ve wanted to get the gee-whiz budgeting software and he hasn’t wanted a budget at all. If my dh were a slacker or a spender, I’d have reason to raise a ruckus.

I really did not get the truth of that until working with a client one day and he was going on and on and on about the convoluted causality of his angst ... then I really understood.  I don't give a hoot about your "story".  It is your "story" and always will be ... unless and until you decided to change your "story".  But then you'll just have a new "story".  LOL ;-)  Get over yourself and I'll help you see how to change your behavior ... but don't tell me your stories or sing me your songs.  I've got my own stories to tell and songs to sing!<br><br>I think an excellent therapeutic modality would be to just duct tape the client's mouth so they can't tell anyone their story.

It is a simulation of that marble in the maze game. But WELL DONE.  Nice background music, a realistic maze made out of wood, and realistic sound effects as the ball roles around and hits the rails.

<div class="content">Mike,<br>"All generalizations are wrong." Except that one, right? LOL <br><br>I've been trying to be flexible with scheduling for so long and it just doesn't work for me (in general). I have this strong desire for perfection and when I fail to adhere to my schedule day in and day out, I get really discouraged. It's much better for me to be unscheduled for the most part. That isn't to say that I don't schedule anything! I do. In fact, I'm the one always saying, "Let's quit talking about getting together and let's put it on the calendar." I keep my commitments. But if I put my hobbies or tasks or even project-related stuff on the calendar, it drives me batty if I can't or don't do it. <br><br>You're right about the no-smoking habit. Except the rewards of any specific time of not smoking aren't as immediately rewarding as the pleasures of smoking. I say that as a lifelong nonsmoker. My mom just quit smoking after 50 years. She continues to be amazed by the number of times and places that the urge crops up. My opinion is that the reason doing the "right thing" isn't as rewarding is because we don't give ourselves credit and celebrate those successes as we should. Again, the focus is always on what we haven't done right.<br><br>The power of self-talk has often been discussed, but is quickly forgotten to our detriment. This morning I was playing tennis and thought, "Wow! I haven't double-faulted all morning!" You guessed it. I double-faulted. LOL <br><br>Related to self-talk is the issue of fear. I don't think the importance of this is discussed in TM circles often enough. Fear never leads to our best performance. Fear is related to punishment. If we punish ourselves by berating ourselves, removing pleasurable activites, etc., we may experience a temporary increase in productivity. Long-term increased productivity and life satisfaction will come from encouraging self-talk and more rewards, not fewer. <br><br>Sorry for the tangent. That's just what's on my mind this afternoon. I just got fresh cream from the farmer and am considering making homemade ice cream. Any tips or recipes?</div>

OMG, to die for ;-)  Slice up the berries and cover in sugar dissolved in lemon juice.  Let them sit (in the fridge is best) for a few hours.  Divide in half, macerate half and pour it into the cream mixture and start the machine going.  Just before it is about to harden, when it is just starting to get nice and thick, pour in the rest of the mixture so you'll have nice bits of strawberries.  Damn, now I'm drooling ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Listomni is a great AF tool.  I've been trying to get it to work just right with previous versions of AF, but with AF4 it is a breeze.  Using a Generic List type, just set up 2 categories, Backlog (closed list) and Active List (open list).  Optionally, set up a 3rd category for items that have been reviewed which you may want to add again later, a tickle file of sorts.<br><br>Set the sort order to be "By Category, Manual Order" and sorted ascending by modified datetime.  That way your closed list will always be ahead of the open list and the category divider will act as the dividing line.  I choose to mark any task I am currently working on as important.  This will higlight that task in a different color.  Once I am done working on it, I either delete it or change it's category, if appropriate, which will move it from the closed to open list.  Anything that needs to be marked for review will be "checked", and later deleted or moved to the optional tickle file category.<br><br>This seems to be a suitable electronic replacement for the paper version of AF4 and mirrors it fairly well.  Kudos to Mark for the continuing development of AF.  In fact, I've struggled trying to stick with AF, but I think AF4 will be the winner for me.</div>

<div class="content">Lee,<br><br>NICE!<br><br>I have a different approach, which may be more complex but gives me more features.<br><br>I use the To Do list type.  That gives me fields that I want.  (I suppose one could add any fields to the Generic List Type as well.)<br><br>I was using two separate lists (Open and Closed) but that interfered with my searching.  Now I use only one list and have a dummy task as the divider line.<br><br>I use the Category and Subcategory for those purposes.  More specifically:<br><br>- Category = WHAT I am going to DO about this task (Do, Call, Errand, Computer, Read, etc.)<br><br>- Sub Category = WHY I am doing the task (Health, Money, Home, Wife, etc.)<br><br>I can then choose to filter my list based on Errands, for example or things I want to talk with my wife about, for example.<br><br>I also use the due date feature to help me in my time blocking (Yes, I'm one of THOSE ;-)  I wish it had a good calendar interface but I guess you can't have everything ;-)<br><br>To keep it linked with my paper book (which is my primary tool) I prefix each task with the page and line number of the task in my book.  Mel pointed out that sorting by creation date would accomplish the same thing.  I have not tested that yet.  But the page and line right in front sure makes it easy to jump where I want to go.<br><br>I love ListOmni for this.  I've written the developer's about that nasty bug where it pops out of the list if you swipe to quickly or touch too long then swipe ... or whatever the hell is causing it.  They probably are already working on it, however.  I look forward to syncing and integration with other apps.<br><br>Glad you like it so much.  Post any other observations or tips you think of, as they come up.  I'll be interested to hear about them.</div>
