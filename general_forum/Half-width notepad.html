<div class="content">Jon:<br><br>I personally use the other half of the page for scribbling brief notes. I think several other people said they did this too in earlier posts.</div>

<div class="content">Oh I see - yes, that makes sense. I've been using the back of the pages sometimes to scribble things down (as I'm writing my lists on front side only).</div>

<div class="content">I found that I need the full width of an A4 page. I started out on an A5 sized notebook, but whereas for DIT this width was amply sufficient, for AF it doesn't seem to work for me. The reason seems to be that in DIT, you only have between 10 and 20 items on your page, mostly from yesterday or today, so the description can be brief and I'll easily remember what it was about. Whereas in AF I have a much longer list, and some items stay on there for a week or more. As I'm working on lots of initiatives, I found I now need to be more explicit in my description of the tasks to remember exactly what they were about or where to find the info needed to process them (reference to an email, a project file, ...)</div>
