<div class="content">I posted a long and off-topic reply to the Occupations discussion about my experience of AF, and noted that I tended not to note down things on my list which I did automatically, eg 'empty dishwasher' or 'fill washing machine'.<br><br>I then saw on another task that Jacques Turbe thinks jotting down even automatic tasks is important because crossing them off gives his current page list a real sense of momentum.<br><br>Well, I started doing that yesterday and my goodness, it works BRILLIANTLY! Thanks, Jacques. <br><br>I noted down every tiny thing I do automatically (even down to 'Shower', 'Contact lenses', 'Brush teeth', 'Blow dry hair' and 'Apply make-up') and crossing them all off meant the biggie on my current list ('Write presentation') was the only outstanding item. <br><br>Well, you can't just carry on resisting something when it's the only uncrossed-out item can you? <br><br>So it's done, 24 hours ahead of schedule. This has literally NEVER happened before. Normally I'm still printing it off on my way to a meeting with the taxi waiting outside, LOL (not). I am in awe of AF, and myself!<br><br>Thanks again Jacques, it was a fantastic piece of advice.</div>

<div class="content">little b<br><br>I've absolutely found that.  I started my lists with tasks like "clean oven" and "empty dishwasher" mixed in with my work related and urgent/imortant tasks and the momentum effect is quite significant.  And let's face it all of those little tasks still need to be done!  I don't write those tasks on my list all of the time but sometimes I do - sometimes it is so I don't forget them and sometimes it just creates momentum. Fantastic!</div>

<div class="content">Presentation is tomorrow Roger, thanks for asking. I'll let you know how it goes ;-)<br><br>I was home at 6.30pm tonight - in the 12 years that I've been working, I've never made it home that early the night before a presentation. <br><br>Amazing!</div>

<div class="content">Little B, I can entirely relate to your excitement, it happens to me whenever I break past limitations in area of time management!</div>
