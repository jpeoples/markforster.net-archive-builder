<div class="content">Mark, I think your next move is an important one. Masterminding the system we're truly looking for.<br><br>We want toast to land jelly-side up. <br><br>Every time.<br><br>The system should overcome the bread's resistance to this, balance the light side with the heavy, and ensure the 5-second rule is always obeyed.</div>

<div class="content">Who is this Doctor Cheng? The basic rule of scones I have always adhered to is more jam than scone and more cream than jam. No cream tea is a real cream tea unless you feel queasy afterwards.<br><br>And note that you never ever ever put the top of the scone on top of the jam and cream as in the illustration. It should be used as the base for another scone + jam + cream.<br><br>The correct result should look something like this:<br><br><a href="http://hungryhinny.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/dscf8131.jpg" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://hungryhinny.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/dscf8131.jpg</a></div>

Any universe that contains creatures remotely like us will necessarily inflict Murphy's law upon those creatures — at least if they eat toast and sit at tables."</div>

<div class="content">I feel this has become relevant again.</div>

<div class="content">At any time you might write Scone, jam or cream on your list. Now whereas AF1 might push you into doing Jam when you aren't ready (because it's on this page but you have no scone) or else dismiss jam entirely, FVP enables you to place the jam exactly when the task stands out.  Which it would do only after the scone is prepared. <br><br>;-)</div>

<div class="content">Alan Baljeu:<br><br>You have to remember that FVP does things in reverse order, so if you have the following tasks on your list:<br><br>Scone<br>Jam<br>Cream<br><br>Then you must first dot "Scone" without dotting "Jam" and "Cream".<br><br>And of course some of us add an additional task: "Butter".</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br>"You have to remember that FVP does things in reverse order, so if you have the following tasks on your list:<br><br>Scone<br>Jam<br>Cream<br><br>Then you must first dot "Scone" without dotting "Jam" and "Cream"."<br><br>And bear in mind, all three of these tasks must be rewritten at the end as they are recurring tasks. So the progression should look like this:<br><br>• Important Project X<br>• Scone<br>Jam<br>Cream<br><br>• Important Project X<br>• Jam<br>Cream<br>Scone<br><br>• Important Project X<br>• Cream<br>Scone<br>Jam<br><br>• Important Project X<br>• Scone<br>Jam<br>Cream<br><br>• Important Project X<br>• Jam<br>Cream<br>Scone<br><br>• Important Project X<br>• Cream<br>Scone<br>Jam<br><br>And so on. <br><br>Work on "Important Project X" may never commence, but there's really no questioning FVP's ability to choose the best task to do in each moment.</div>

<div class="content">Michael B.<br><br>Just how many scones are you planning to eat? As I said earlier, no cream tea is a real cream tea until you feel queasy afterwards.</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br>"Just how many scones are you planning to eat?"<br><br>One should not underestimate the FVP algorithm to produce just the right amount of cream teas eaten to attain enlightened queasy nirvana.</div>
