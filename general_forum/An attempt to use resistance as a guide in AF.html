<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-10-21 20:54</div>
<div class="content">+AJPM+<br><br>After reading Alan's latest comment in Mark Forster's blog post "Using resistance as a guide,"<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2010/9/30/using-resistance-as-a-guide.html#comment10135934" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2010/9/30/using-resistance-as-a-guide.html#comment10135934</a><br><br>I speculated whether I can use the "resistance principle" in AF.  Sounds kinda crazy, right?  I mean, all versions of AF rests on the principle of tasks "standing out" when they are ready to be done.  And of course (if you had the same experience as me) most of the items that "stand out" in AF are the easy ones.  <br><br>I then remembered this thread that I read AND even participated a few months ago,<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1173500" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1173500</a><br><br>about interrogative self-talk.  Interrogative self-talk, or asking yourself a question or questions before working like, "Will I do this?", was found by a research study to be a more effective way of motivating oneself for work than declarative self talk, or the telling yourself something before you work like "I can do this!"<br><br>I then thought, what if I made an algorithm of questions that I can use everytime I use my AF? Would that bring out the "resistance principle?"  Well, the best that I got is a "want/need" algorithm.  I think it is close enough.  Anyways, here is the algorithm and steps that I came up with, which I have been using for the past week or so.  Please note that I use a filtering/prefiltering tweak of the tasks I need to do this week (step 4):<br><br><br>1. Go through your AF per the rules of your list until an item stands out.<br><br>2. Looking at this item, ask yourself, "Do I want to do this?"  As you ask this, take note of your thoughts and feelings.<br><br>3. Next, ask yourself, "Do I need to do this?" Again take note of your thoughts and feelings.  If you can either honestly say YES to this specific question (not the one at step #2) or your feelings are at ease, then go to step #5.  If you can either honestly answer NO to this specific question (not the one at step #2) or your feelings become troubled, go to the next step.<br><br>4. Ask yourself, "Do I need to do this this week?" Again take note of your thoughts and feelings.  If you can either honestly say YES to this or your feelings are at ease, then leave the task alone and go back to step 1.  If you can either honestly answer NO to this or your feelings become troubled, dismiss it, then go back to step 1.<br><br>5. Ask yourself, "How can I do this conclusively, concisely, and carefully?" Then using the answers that you can think of from this question, do the task until you feel you have done what you should do, then go back to step 1.<br><br><br>Now I will explain the rationale for each step.<br><br>a. I found that feelings are VERY important in this.  If you cannot really say with your mind what your answers to the questions are, then go with your heart.  I found that troubled feelings mean you disagree with it; peaceful feelings mean you agree with it.<br><br>b. In my experience, the question "Do I want to do this?" is not directly important in task selection, but rather ENHANCES the answering of the question "Do I need to do this?"  You see, when I ask myself "Do I need to do this?" sometimes (well...actually most of the time) I somehow trick myself to mean that question to be "Do I WANT to do this?" However, when I answer FIRST the question "Do I WANT to do this?" THEN answer the question "Do I NEED to do this?" I have no more excuse to change "need" to "what".  And let me tell you: sometimes those answers can be VERY surprising.<br><br>c. Of course if the answer to the question "Do I need to do it?" is NO then I will not do it now, but if the task was "standing out" then there should be a reason why it stood out from the rest. Most commonly it is because I want to do it but I don't need to do it now, yet in the near future I might (or not).  That is the rationale for the question in step 3: "Do I need to do this this week?"  As I said, I am using the filtering/pre-filtering tweak by Mike that I summarized here,<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1262814" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1262814</a><br><br>Therefore, this question puts the said tweak in action.  If I do not need to do it this week, I can dismiss it and review at a later time whether I can/need to do it next week.  Otherwise, it stays.  <br><br>d. Finally, if the answer to the question "Do I need to do it?" is YES, then I should start on it in the best way that I can manage.  I found that the question "How can I do this conclusively, concisely, and carefully?" prepares my mind into focusing into what are important in doing something (as eloquently said by Erik): effectiveness, efficiency, and (as I painfully found out) care.<br><br><br>The results have been very encouraging.  The algorithm in my experience actually ENHANCES the "standing out" of tasks, and at the end of the day, I always have the feeling that I did what were the most important things to do.  It is also very humbling: it makes me realize how much my wants and needs can sometimes be VERY different.<br><br>I encourage everyone to give this algorithm a try.  I hope it will be a blessing to you, and let's see if we can enhance it further.<br><br>God bless.</div>

<div class="content">+AJPM+<br><br>I just realized now that actually steps 1 to 3 are the core steps of the algorithm, and steps 4 and 5 are optional.<br><br>God bless.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for sharing. Intriguing, but will take some time to grasp. Perhaps an example or two will help make this concrete. For example, the above post:<br>1 Did you want to post?<br>2 Did you (in some sense) need to post?<br>Explain the workings that lead to action. And If you please also illustrate with a second different example.</div>

<div class="content">+AJPM+<br><br>Hi Alan,<br><br>As you requested, let us use the post above as an item to consider.  <br><br>1.  I came across the item "Post Need/Want at MF"<br>2.  I ask myself, "Do I want to do this?" I answered to myself YES.<br>3.  I ask myself, "Do I need to do this?" I answered YES, because I needed to relax a bit after doing a lot of cleaning here.<br>4.  I ask myself, "How can I do this conclusively, concisely, and carefully?" Well, a draft of this post actually was in a text file in my computer for the past few days, so I opened it and got right into it.  I found that I can finish it right now so I did, and posted it (conclusively).  Before I started, I made sure that I've set up my alarm to tell me if I am doing it too long (concisely).  I then made sure that I have no errors before posting, but, knowing myself, after posting I checked, and sure enough there were typos, I changed them (carefully).<br><br>I can give you another example if you want, Alan, but later, OK? Have some things to do, sorry.<br><br>God bless.</div>

<div class="content">Interesting post. I'm wondering how much difference it makes to the dynamic of AF. For instance I'm now on the task "Comments". Do I want to do it? Well, at some level I want to do it because I like to keep up to date with the Comments. But as far as doing it now, my main motivation is that it's the easiest task on the page which I'm on at the moment. So yes, I do want to do it, but I probably wouldn't have done it if it hadn't been on the list. Do I need to do this? Only in the sense that I need to do something now and this is the best thing immediately to hand.<br><br>I'm not sure that all that complicated thought is a great advantage over the task just standing out on the list.<br><br>To actually use the Resistance Principle I would have had to ask myself which task on this page (AF1) am I resisting the most at this moment?</div>

<div class="content">In the past, I assumed "standing out" equated to "I feel ready to do it", where feel is an operative word.  Now I'm thinking of "standing out" as more a question of whether the idea of the task makes me pause.  <br><br>I will possibly linger over that task and argue with myself.  "It's important, so let's go", "I can't, because [I'm not sure what to do / Now is not a good time. / There are other easier things out there. / Other things are more pressing.]  It's like Moses at that burning bush :-/  And like that bush, it stands out.  If it takes a large amount of though effort to resist it, that must mean it's important, and it really is standing out.<br><br>I think this event calls for an attitude shift.  Instead of reasons I can't do, maybe I should see challenges to overcome.  Then I should tackle those challenges, and get started.</div>

<div class="content">Alan:<br><br>You past assumption is certainly what I intended "standing out" to mean. In fact Sarah in her comment on the blog post put her finger on it when she said:<br><br>"I think the reason Autofocus works is because it will always present you a task that matches your energy levels at that time." <br><br>So I worry that if one follows nuntym's idea then you are trying to combine two incompatible and opposite methods.</div>

<div class="content">Do you mean to say "Use Resistance as a Guide" and "Use AutoFocus" are incompatible suggestions?</div>

<div class="content">Yes, but I'm willing to be persuaded otherwise!</div>

<div class="content">To expand a bit on my last comment, "Resistance" works on the principle that you go for the things you are resisting most first, while the various forms of Autofocus work on the principle that you get the easy stuff done and then you are gradually presented with more difficult stuff.<br><br>If you applied "Resistance" to AF1 for example you would go to a page, do the thing you were resisting most. But then, since everything on the page would then presumably be easier than what you have just done, where would you stop? Logically you'd carry on and do everything on the page before moving on to the next page.</div>

<div class="content">+AJPM+<br><br>*sigh* This one is a bust.  I found myself using my notebook less and less, and I cannot seem to understand why until I cam back to the original AF4 rules, and it was working well again.<br><br>I guess Mark is right, "resistance as a guide" and AF seem to be incompatible, at least when used simultaneously.<br><br>God bless.</div>
