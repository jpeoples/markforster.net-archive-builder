<div class="content">Inspired by Neil Cumming's post, and others, I'm going to give SMEMA another shot. But to do so, I'm going to borrow what I've learned from Stickk and Beeminder and put some money on the line:<br><br>If I use SMEMA for two weeks (starting today), I will donate $50 to Mr. Forster<br>If I abandon SMEMA for whatever reason (within the two week period), Mr Forster will receive a $500 payment. <br><br>That is all.<br>Feel free to hold me accountable by asking for updates, etc.</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br><< why not make it a month and $1,000>><br><br>It's all about finding that "OUCH" sweet spot. $500 seems to fit the bill.<br><br>Questions for Mark: <br><br>1. How did you handle situations whereby an interruption or circumstances interrupted your SMEMA chain?  Did you rewrite the list and begin anew or start where you left off? <br><br>2. For metrics (to gauge the success of one's efforts with SMEMA), do you suggest counting every task completed - regardless if they occurred within SMEMA rules, or every SMEMA chain (3 tasks) you fulfilled.</div>

<div class="content">Avrum,<br><br>Interesting idea to put (different amounts of) money on the line, regardless of whether you stick to it.<br><br>I think you will find that you can keep using SMEMA, with zero to any number of auxiliary lists/tools.  So if you have existing AF/FV/etc. lists, or feel a need for an auxiliary set of reminders, they all just work as places to look if the next two tasks aren't obvious.<br><br>Good luck!</div>

<div class="content">Mark (or others)<br><br>I'm a little thick, and not grasping the rationale of "replenish two tasks at a time" (see quote below). I'm not sure how "replenishing two tasks" vs "doing all three tasks" encourages choosing difficult or high resistance tasks. Help? Merci.<br><br>"Q. Why replenish two tasks at a time? Why is that better than doing all three tasks and then adding three new ones?<br><br>A. If I do all three tasks in one go, then the first of the new tasks has no distance. That means that it will probably be an easy “filler”. Once I’ve decided on one easy filler then it’s likely that I’ll go on chosing easy tasks. It’s important that all the tasks I choose have distance at the time of choosing. It means I am more likely to choose a task because it is right rather than because it is easy."</div>

<div class="content">avrum:<br><br><< I'm not sure how "replenishing two tasks" vs "doing all three tasks" encourages choosing difficult or high resistance tasks >><br><br>In my early days of time management I used to advise people (and still do sometimes) to write down the one task they were going to do next and then do it. The rationale behind this was that it stopped them from just mindlessly drifting into the next task. Instead, they had to make a conscious decision (emphasis on "conscious").<br><br>I then discovered that it worked better if they wrote two tasks down, did them both and then wrote another two. It seemed that the second task was usually a more "significant" task than the first. I decided that the reason for this was that the first task had to be done straightaway, but there was a time  gap ("distance") before doing the second task. This made the second task less threatening than the first, which allowed for it to be a more difficult task.<br><br>I experimented with various numbers of tasks to see how far this effect extended. I found that three was the optimum number. Above three, resistance tended to build up against the inflexible nature of the list, negating the positive effect of "distance".<br><br>However there was still a problem in that when I wrote three tasks down, the first task still had to be done straight away. This lack of "distance" for the first task generally meant that it tended to be a filler and only the second two tasks were significant.<br><br>Then I worked out that I could avoid this by replenishing the list back up to three tasks whenever it dropped to one. That way I was never writing down a task which I had to do immediately (except for the very first task of all). In other words all tasks had "distance" when written down, but the list was short enough not to build up any resistance.<br><br>This makes the process of developing SMEMA sound more straightforward and purposeful than it actually was, but I hope you get the picture.</div>

<div class="content">I'm thinking of experimenting with using a) Random Time Management for the daytime and early-evening 'productive' hours;  then b), switching to SMEMA later on in the day with a bias (slight or otherwise) towards 'R&R' type activities. e.g., Read novel, Watch DVD, Go for a walk, Listen to music, Surf the web etc...<br><br>I wonder if it might afford a suitable balance between work and leisure.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark<br>oops!  I guess that one flew over my head because some people actually do enjoy things like cleaning, ironing, painting, fixing stuff, etc.  Actually, if I have good music, better yet, good company, I don't mind it nearly as much as usual.<br><br>It sounds like Lucy and you are a good team.  You take her out to eat often and take her on glorious trips.  She's lucky to have you as I'm sure you're lucky to have her as well.<br><br>Avrum<br>Congrats!  Good going!  A while back you did something similar like tossing $10 bills out of your window when you went to bed too late.  That inspired me to attach $100 bills to my diary to finish an article.  Just the idea of having to put my money in the dog poop bag had me finish it in a couple to days to save about $1,000.  Fear, disgust, competition and social witnessing works wonders, yeah?  If I did SMEMA, it would have been fun to join you. The camaraderie would have helped me enjoy it more and compel me not to dare slack off!  LOL!<br><br>Good on you!</div>

<div class="content">(DAY 13) An interesting observation...<br><br>With Mark's other systems, I found I needed a break from the rules and structure. Somehow - and I'm not exactly sure why - even a brief break from the (AF, DWM, etc.) rules made it difficult to reengage with the system. Due to SMEMA's simplicity and quick turnaround (finish two tasks, and refresh the list with two more), the list always feels fresh and relevant to my mood, situation, etc. To date, it is the only system that I've been able to engage with at home and work.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Avrum<br>That's really great news!  <br><br>I've been with the same system for years but sometimes I'll deviate a bit just to keep things fresh. Also, sometimes when I go off the rails, it's nice to have a simple system to guide me back to normal.  Your system is even simpler so you should do very well with it.  I'm still always on the lookout for little tips and workarounds to make things easier or serve special circumstances.  You're lucky that you won't need any of that with SMEMA.  I wish I could do SMEMA dependably but I can't.  I'm glad that it does for you what I wish it did for me.  LOL!</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br>Did you encounter situations where - either due to mood or fatigue - you had trouble identifying: <br><br><<what the right thing is>> <br><br>and your lists were populated with low resistance tasks? Or is the goal to never have a chain of tasks like this: 1. Facebook 2. Watch sports 3. Play the lottery<br><br>If that's the case, what did you do when you had trouble identifying "the right thing"? <br><br>Also, regarding metrics you said:<br><br><<I would count tasks - but only those done within the rules.>><br><br>Wouldn't this metric be misleading re; productivity if:<br><br>On Day 1 I had a bunch of "Facebooks" in my SMEMA chain, leading to a final tally of 45 tasks completed<br><br>On Day 2 I spent more focused time on a high priority item, but ended the day with 22 tasks completed?<br><br>I wouldn't consider Day 1 to be more productive. So what does "total tasks" actually mean?</div>

<div class="content">avrum:<br><br>Total tasks is just one way of measuring the results of the system. It's useful but not the be all and end all of it.<br><br>The real question is whether you got done the things you needed and wanted to get done. In other words, looking back did you feel that you achieved what you set out to achieve? And, as a secondary question, do you think you would have achieved as much using any other system (or none)?</div>
