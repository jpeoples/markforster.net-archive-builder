<div class="content">I'm confused about something.  Let's say "Work on my Taxes" is an item in my Backlog.  <br>So I work on my taxes for awhile and then cross it off.   But since I'm not finished, I add the item again on my "Active List."   Then I keep going down the list of items in my Backlog.<br>So far so good.<br><br>Then, later, I've done a thorough round on my Backlog and I jump over to my Active List.  I see "Work on my Taxes."  So I work on my taxes for awhile and cross it off.  But I'm still not finished with my taxes.  Do I re-add "Work on my Taxes" at the bottom of my "Active List"?   And when I get to the bottom of my "Active List" and I re-encounter the same item, can I do the same item again?   <br><br>Sorry about this laborious question, but I'm confused about this.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Steve,<br><br>>>>Then, later, I've done a thorough round on my Backlog and I jump over to my Active List. I see "Work on my Taxes." So I work on my taxes for awhile and cross it off. But I'm still not finished with my taxes. Do I re-add "Work on my Taxes" at the bottom of my "Active List"?<<<<br><br>Yes.<br><br><br>>>>And when I get to the bottom of my "Active List" and I re-encounter the same item, can I do the same item again?<<<<br><br>Yes.<br><br>Sometimes, when I have lots of urgent things going on, I find that I keep chasing the end of my active list for hours or even days.  I have five or six items that I work on, then add again to the end of the list.  And so I keep cycling through that same group of items for quite a while.  But that's OK.  When the urgency comes under control, the system just naturally leads me to spend some time on the backlog again.</div>

<div class="content">Hi all<br>I'm not an AFer, but I'm simply curious about what is the reasoning about writing tasks over and over again until completed.  Why not just leave it where it is on the list until it is completed. I could see rewriting it on daily pages but AF4 isn't daily.  My list is weekly so I only write things once a week.  ....just curious about why it needs to be rewritten unless it's up for review.  Otherwise you could work on it, scan the list(s) following the rules and revisit it without all the lengthy rewrites. What's the advantage I'm not seeing?<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Hi Learning,<br><br>If you just left it there and moved on, then following the AF4 rules you wouldn't see that task again till you came to the end of your Open List ("Active List"), then completed at least one cycle through your Closed List ("Backlog"), and then worked through your Open List again till you came to that task again.  <br><br>The net result is you'd have large gaps of time between each "little and often" iteration on that task.  So, it would probably morph into "little and occasionally".<br><br>By crossing out the item and adding it to the end again, you will be sure to see that item at least one more time before coming to the end of the Open List.  This gives you the ability to push forward several different projects all at the same time, and _keep_ pushing them forward as long as urgency demands it.  <br><br>Hope that helps clarify ...  :-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Seraphim<br>aaahhh...now I see!  Thank you!  IOW, the rewrites gives you opportunities to keep working on those tasks.  It's sort of pacing your more urgent stuff to completion without having the revisit the less relevant tasks for the meanwhile.  That makes sense.  You've also revealed to me why the lists are so long!  One large task could be dozens of rewrites...IOW, sometimes tasks on the list are units of action toward completion.  <br>I don't do AF but, I sometimes list 3 or 4 tasks that I work on in a round robin rotation....sort of similar to the idea behind the rewrites.  I do this for either onerous tasks or I do this to use less taxing tasks as breaks from a heavy task rather than actual stopping my work.  Sometimes an actual break isn't necessary...just a break from a certain task.  We're doing the same sort of thing using different methods and rules.  <br>Thanks, Seraphim.<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Learning,<br><br>It may be even more than that.  Suppose that during the process of working a really large task, the closed list is ... well, closed ;-)  I.e. you dismiss everything on it and move the line.  Now what was the open list becomes closed.  When you hit that big task on the closed list, if you did not rewrite it at the end of the open list it would change the way the rules made the list work.  Actually, you'd never be able to dismiss the closed list after that until that big task was done because it would be "worked on" but not "crossed off".  The rules don't even have a way to deal with that case.  The rules depend on things being crossed off the closed list so it can be dispatched and the open list items be promoted to the closed list where they get more attention.<br><br>I've actually tried it both ways (crossing off and not) and it does seem to work better when I do cross off and rewrite.<br><br>OH, and one more thing, in the rewriting process there is the opportunity to rethink and rewrite the task.  "Build Deck" becomes "Complete Steps" and "Buy Sealer" and maybe something else as well.<br><br>OH OH ;-) and there is a psychological component as well (isn't there always ;-)  There is some positive feedback that I am actually accomplishing things.  It can seem a bit futile if I work all day and the page has not changed.  At least this way I mark progress.  I get the feedback that I'm actually doing something.  Hard to describe but that feedback helps.<br><br>All of that said, I'm apt not to recopy a task if it is only a line or two away.  I certainly won't recopy it if it becomes something like:<br><br>- Do Project<br><then I take a break><br>- Do Project<br><br>That seems the degenerative case that becomes absurd.  It is one of those logical black holes that you get when you become TOO much a slave to the algorithm ;-)  (Wearing my Computer Scientist hat here ;-)  In fact, if I start "chasing the end of the open list", I'll arbitrarily "break out" and start at the top of the closed list just to clear my head.</div>

<div class="content">Good Morning, Andreas<br>I gave Autofocus a couple of serious attempts, but it wrecks havoc with my brain injuries/limitations.  You all are using cognitive functions that don't work well with my brain.  <br>I'm ashamed to admit the primary reason I'm here.......I get very alone when I'm riding out my pain.  Plus this site is pleasant :>).  I don't surf the net because when I'm in pain I don't want to read unpleasant things.  The folks here are both pleasant and intelligent.  I used to read voraciously but I can't anymore. TV doesn't offer much plus I can't hold the characters and plot so I get peeved having the back up the program over and over....the payoff isn't there  *sigh*.....So here I sit....until the pain subsides a bit.....<br>learning as I go</div>

ROTFL  <<<<br><br>Dang, are you ever behind the times.  I am not sure you can even BUY a transistor any longer.  It is all large scale integrated circuits to my knowledge.  (No, I[m wrong.  You can buy them at Radio Shack, it seems, for a buck and a half.  LOL ;-)  I remember when the first transistor was offered for sale to the public ... it was a Raytheon CK722 ... amazing what we remember from way, way back.<br><br>>>> I shouldn't make fun of those poor souls....actually it's quite sad really.....*blush* I'll count my blessings instead.  <<<<br><br>Yes, those folks are not responsible for it, nor are they in much in control of it.  But you were not making fun of them ... just the ideas they have.  If they were in control, they'd laugh too.</div>

ROTFL!.....or....it might alter my fashion sense toward frilly, froo-froo......Nope, I'd rather it kill me than live the remainder of my life living in a personality that would support frilly, froo-froo!  harrumph!

<div class="content">Funny, it amazes me too.  I should not be amazed as I've been involved in much of the development of this stuff for years ... but when the actualy implementation comes out, I'm as wowed as anyone.  My recent adventure into the iPhone is a good example of this.  I evaluated one of the first trial implementations of a tablet OS ... back in 1990 or so.  It failed, but I could see the power of the idea.  Now we have that, and even better that it's included in a phone, with GPS, an internet browser, etc.<br><br>You know those films where someone is on a rocket sled or blasting into space ... where the G forces pull back the skin on their faces?  That is kind of how I feel about the current technology curve.  The acceleration is mind boggling.</div>

<div class="content">Learning,<br><br>>>>  You really do "get" me! Again, thanks for the belly laughs!  <<<<br><br>;-)  Yeah, froo-froo is more a state of mind, I think.  My wife is a powerful woman.  She is a licensed massage therapist, and if you don't think that takes strength!  And she is a school teacher ... and that takes the personality of a drill sargent.  She does not wear makeup at all, but underneath the sneakers she usually has painted toes.  As I say, a state of mind ;-)  She cracks me up!</div>
