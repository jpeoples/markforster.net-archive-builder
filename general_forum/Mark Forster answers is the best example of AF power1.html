<div class="content">I implemented AF in  very successful way since the first day. A couple of doubts were quickly clarify in forum topics. <br><br>But there is a really amazing thing in all that: the incredible level of participation in discussions and blog updates of Mark Forster, the creator of the method. <br><br>Being a participant in several discussion forums I never saw before such a great commitment and productivity of an author. <br><br>In my opinion,  Mark s capacity to handle that huge volume of information  is one of the best proofs of the power of AF.   <br><br>Congratulations, Mark Forster for giving us this wonderful tool.<br><br>Hugo</div>
