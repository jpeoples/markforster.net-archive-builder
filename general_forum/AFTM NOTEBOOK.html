<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">In my first posting on Monday, I mentioned that I had set up my AFTM list in OneNote 2007.  I still want to pursue the electronic route.<br>As my work takes me mainly abroad, I decided to buy an A5 notebook as Mark suggested.  At the airport on Tuesday I bought a spiral bound A5 notebook, 200 pages, 32 lines per page, no margin.<br>I have to admit that there is still an appealing quality about using pen and paper, but often the computer notebook is not readily accessible in some places, so the A5 notebook is a very useful component, especially during long flights.<br>As my company is a (very) small business one and my only permanent office is my home office, I made the mistake of putting everything – office/work and personal – on one list.  Others may also do this and be ok with it, but I realise this can lead to a lack of focus and easy distraction.<br>However, I don’t want to have separate notebooks for office/work and personal, so I use the front of the book for the office/work list, then flip the book over so that the back cover is in view with the spiral binding still on the left, open it and this is where I capture my personal list.  So one book maintains the two lists, but keeps them separate.<br>Note: I see another user has already suggested this when i checked the forum prior to posting this!<br>I use the right hand pages for listing, the left-hand page for notes for other purposes, eg on the long haul from Amsterdam to Johannesburg, I set out my thoughts on how AFTM can be mainly electronic, using OneNote and Outlook 2007, probably in combination with Linenberger’s TWC.<br>One other thing others may want to comment on: I think Dismissed items should be categorised (use different colour highlighters) into Dismissed for Review and Defer to Do Later.  The second one can then be earmarked for follow-up in Outlook, tickler, diary, whatever.  The first category will be reviewed when I feel it is right to do so (using a reminder in Outlook so I don’t forget).<br>But I still want to go electronic, and use the A5 book for those occasions when I don’t have quick access to my computer.<br></div>

<div class="content">Roger:<br><br>"One other thing others may want to comment on: I think Dismissed items should be categorised (use different colour highlighters) into Dismissed for Review and Defer to Do Later."<br><br>Good idea. Different people may want to have different ways of doing this, but this is an good example of how to adapt the system to one's own preferences.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Roger<br><br>I did a couple of postings re setting up a system in OneNote.  You probably already know these tips but in case they are of help to you ....<br><br>If you set the page to narrow ruled it lines up well and 34 lines fit perfectly onto one screen page.<br><br>I use the yellow highlighter for completed tasks and will use a different colour for ultimately rejected items.<br><br>Outstanding tasks can be immediately sent to Outlook<br><br>I also use a page to do a screen clip of the blog list when I have finished reviewing postings.  It enables me to see quickly where I had got to on my previous session when I go back to it.  At the end of the next review session I can then just "undo" and reclip.<br><br>My Notebook is "originally!!) called Autofocus and provides a natural repository for any additional lists, my schedule, projects and files in the same place.  It works very well for me but I am still starting my lists on paper as that is the recommended method and I think makes it easy to capture everything immediately.  I am using a standard A4 34 lined book with a smaller book for travel to capture thoughts and tasks when away from my main list.<br><br>Hope that may be of help.</div>
