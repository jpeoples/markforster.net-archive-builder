<div class="content">Mark, can I persuade you to continue the review of your systems that you were doing 13+ years ago? <a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/category/review-of-systems" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/category/review-of-systems</a><br><br>I just love your insights and post-mortem-like analysis.</div>

<div class="content">Manuel:<br><br>Probably not... I think I've forgotten what most of them were!<br><br>But I am working on identifying which the best system is for me, and then writing a review about that.</div>
