<div class="content">I'm currently working with How To Make Your Dreams Come True, and so far, the dialoguing's been very helpful.  The other two things, not so much.  Especially the visions and goals - even though I've been trying to write them out consistently, revising them as I go, I just recieve no real sense of pull from them.  And these aren't visions of what I think I really want - I've gotten pretty introspective and made them according to what I truly want, like freedom and flow and passion in my life.  Though maybe I could go even deeper, seeing as how they're not doing anything for me...<br><br>I'm not sure what the problem is, really.  Do you think I might need to hone my vision even further, and if so, how do I be more authentic towards myself?  Or do you think writing and reading these things just aren't for me and I should find another way of presenting them?</div>

<div class="content">What I mean is that I'm not writing my visions as things I THINK I really want.  Like what other people want me to do.  I've been introspective about it, drilling down further and further to what I truly desire.  At least that was my intent.</div>

<div class="content">MHW:<br><br>Try the following exercise:<br><br>Take each element of your vision in turn and list all the reasons you want it. Then list all the reasons you don't want it. <br><br>For all the negative reasons, ask yourself the question: "If I don't want that, what do I want?"<br><br>Then amend your vision accordingly.</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br>I did your exercise, and somehow it's unlocked what I want even more deeply than what I thought I wanted.  The vision feels a lot more authentic and amazing now.  I want to try it out for an extended time with the full Dreams setup, but so far I am really loving what I've got.</div>

<div class="content">Just as an additional bit, what's the kind of feeling you get when you look at your vision day after day?  Because I've had a history of feeling inspired about something for a little while, then going back the next day and finding the words don't really rev me up like it did before.  Would you say it helps to stick with it for a while and revise it like you advise in order to more easily access that enthusiasm?</div>

<div class="content">MHW:<br><br>Once you've got a vision that seems right, I suggest you look at it about once a week. More often if you wish, but it's not really necessary.</div>
