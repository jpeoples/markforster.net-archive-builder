<div class="content">I wonder if anyone else in the UK has used SF to complete our 2011 Census due today? I'm positively looking forward to it by using C2 and expectant to see long it's going to take. <br><br>This is part of the power of SF for me - bringing motivation, intrigue and freshness into obligatory, time-draining, methodical tasks. In my book it's called magic!</div>

<div class="content">I'm in the US, but I couldn't pass up a thread with a title like that!<br><br>I am doing taxes instead of a Census. Ever since I straightened out C2, the taxes have just kind of flowed along. Today I finished all the data gathering and now just need to copy some numbers to various places. At the same time, I took a second project from haven't-touched-it-in-fourteen-months to 95% complete.</div>

<div class="content">Robina,<br><br>My UK Census was a C2 item, but as I still in Syria, I've just done it online.<br><br>My neighbour collects all our post back in Hereford, so I asked him to open our census form and send me the code.<br><br>He did, I did and it's done, Four Cheers?!? ;-)))))))<br><br>The online form automatically skips sections  - if applicable - based on your latest question response.  I reckon it's better than doing it manually on the form.</div>

<div class="content">Doing MY Tax is also on my SF, not in col2 yet. It should be pretty soon though, since my deadline is 30apr11. :-/</div>

<div class="content">Roger J,<br><br>It was great timing to hear of your online experience just as I was about to tackle my first C2 appearance of Do Census. It encouraged me to stick in there to the end in one go. <br><br>Cheers all round!<br><br>It has again reminded me of the beauty of this dual stream system because it has been a C1 item for the last 10 days or so and only today notched up to C2. Definitely no anxiety around it because of the naturally smooth dynamic of the process and what feels like its inbuilt and trustworthy safety net.<br><br>Wishing you well for your return to UK (if I've understood right in another post)</div>

<div class="content">Bernie/sabre23t<br><br>I’m already, dare I say it, quite looking forward to doing my Tax this year with SF. I’ve even done the first step 10 months earlier than I normally do although it’s still carefully worded so that it remains in C1 for the moment. The deadline is not until January 2012 and I don't want to give my accountant too much of a shock at my prompt efficiency. <br><br>SF has definitely cast a spell on me.</div>

<div class="content">Hello Robina,<br><br>Thanks for the wishes, it's getting a bit iffy here in Damascus now.<br><br>For the last three nights we've had noisy pro-government demonstrations (one till 03h00!), however, the government has warned that its supporters should keep off the streets as there's rumours of a big anti-govt demo tonight.<br><br>We're booked to fly out on 7 April, but are now thinking about an earlier exit, once we can get the excess freight to the handling agents.<br><br>SF?  Seems to be a largely C2 activity now, even non-relevant (in current circumstances) C2 items are being deferred till we get back to the UK, whenever.  The beauty is that so much of my stuff is captured and written/typed down that I can focus on the immediate real priorities in the knowledge that SF has corralled most of the important stuff already.<br><br>Last page C1 entries include: 'Revisit current travel checklists, trim some items off them'.  I think I have a tad too many back-up items, although I don't intend dispensing with all of them, eg I take two power adapters for my Toshiba notebook; one stays at the assignment office, the other at my current apartment, but should one of them fail, I have a replacement to hand.  It's not always easy to get replacement items in some of my locations!<br><br>UPDATE: just seen your latest post, I assume your tax deadline is for your personal tax, I nearly got caught last tax year when they advanced company tax deadline from 31 January to 31 December!</div>
