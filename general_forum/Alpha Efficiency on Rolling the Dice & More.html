<div class="content">Heard of Alpha Efficiency magazine? I was asked to contribute to this month's issue to discuss my experience with a Year of Living Productively and how other people could do the same thing I did. <br><br>The magazine opens with an interview with Graham Allcott discussing his use of dice. Thought there were several who would enjoy it. You can get a free trial of the magazine here: <a href="http://www.alphaefficiency.com/magazine" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.alphaefficiency.com/magazine</a></div>

<div class="content">Sorry, Seraphim. You have to download it on itunes and you'll get a free issue. https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/alpha-efficiency-magazine/id739143901?mt=8  They do list another method if you don't have iTunes on the first link I gave.</div>
