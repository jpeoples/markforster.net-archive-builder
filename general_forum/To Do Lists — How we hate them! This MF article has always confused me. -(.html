<div class="content">Here's the article:<br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/to-do-lists" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/to-do-lists</a><br><br>Here's a part of it:<br>"Have a separate place to record new ideas. When you think of something new to do, don’t write it straight onto your to-do list. Items should only go on your to-do list after they have been subjected to rigorous assessment as mentioned above. On the other hand it’s important not to lose new ideas, so keep a separate list of “possible” actions."<br><br>This sounds like Mike's grass catcher concept?  <br><br>This also doesn't make sense to me - the positives make sense, the negatives don't:<br><br>"The advantages of a to-do list are obvious: everything is prioritised; you know exactly what to do next; things which are urgent and/or important get done first; items don’t get lost; and you have somewhere to write new things as they arise. What’s more it’s ideally suited for computerisation. What could be better?<br><br>There is only one disadvantage of a to-do list. It doesn’t work! <br><br>There are two main reasons why it doesn’t work. The first is that you never get more than a third of the way down the list. The second is that for every item that you cross off the list, you think of another three items to go on it."<br><br>This has always bugged me because this isn't how I (or most people I know) use a daily to-do list.  Actually I don't know anyone who uses a daily to-do list like this.   I just write down what I plan on doing for the day or for a segment of time.  If I don't get more than 1/3 of it done, it's because some major disruption happened.   I also add very, very little to it - if anything, just keep some time open to deal with today-type interruptions. <br><br>Maybe someone - Mark? - can explain this to me?<br><br>"Don’t rewrite your list every day. Keep the same list going. That way you will become acutely conscious of how long items have been on it."<br><br>I don't know about this - Penelope Trunk says:<br>"I rewrite the list every day by hand. Because if something on the list is not worth taking the time to rewrite by hand, it’s not worth taking the time to do."<br><br><a href="http://blog.penelopetrunk.com/2010/03/16/how-to-get-unstuck-in-life/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://blog.penelopetrunk.com/2010/03/16/how-to-get-unstuck-in-life/</a></div>

<div class="content">I personally like to do lists.  They solve my biggest issue which is forgetting to do something.  So knowing I have a complete capture is a benefit to me.  I never worry about the size of a list or unfinished items.  These issues are less of a problem than something big falling through the cracks, that can be a huge issue.  I follow all of Mark's tips on how to make them better.  So far after trying and developing lots of systems, the simple running list of to-dos in a steno notebook has not failed me yet.  I review it many times a day and let my brain prioritize what needs to get done.  I also think rewriting to frequently is time wasted.  I only rewrite when I am out of pages and then I start a new book and consolidate it down and use it as an opportunity to review.  <br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div>

<div class="content">What I see in Mark's post sounds a lot like how I observed a coworker operating with the Franklin-Covey page-a-day organizing system.  Each day he'd rewrite tasks from the previous day, mark them ABCD priority, and work on a third of what was on the list.  On the whole he seemed to be well-organized and effective so it's hard to criticize from that perspective.  Certainly he was better-organized than everyone else who had no system of organizing.<br><br>But Mark's responses ring true.  Many of those C's stayed on that list a long time.  They probably fell off when C turned into D or whatever.  Mark's right: C priority items might _never_ get worked on.  If that's acceptable, then okay you wasted time entering and reentering.  If not, then the system is flawed.  Of course intelligent people can deal with a flawed system, and correct their behavior to make it work.<br><br>Penelope and Mark agree on the value of dropping stuff.  Penelope uses 'laziness' as a cue to get things dropped.  Mark uses 'ignored too long' as a cue to either drop or action stuff.  Seems to me the latter has more power.</div>

<div class="content">I don't know Alan, he must have been doing some filtering or dumping the low priority items, because you could get away with that for a couple of days, but you'd eventually (pretty quickly) be rewriting pages worth of tasks every day if you only worked on 1/3 of the list all the time.  <br><br>I guess if all he worked on was the higher priority stuff, he probably had an excellent system going.<br><br>Eventually, I'd get tired of rewriting something over and over again and either do it or dump it - I guess that qualifies as ignored too long.<br><br>Gerry, I guess I have a freakishly simple life these days.  I couldn't fill up one page of a steno pad with what I'm choosing to focus on right now.  Depends on the job though, that last one with all the trivia had me pulling my hair out with all the stuff I presumably had to remember.</div>

<div class="content">I think there are three categories of tasks that often get confused. 1. There are tasks that must be done on a specific day. 2. There are tasks that must be done, but not necessarily today. 3. And there are those we would like to do. Maybe. :-) Mixing these together on one list can be confusing, at least for most folks. <br><br>Category 1's are what David Allen said were the only tasks to go on a calendar/daily diary. The biggest problem seems to be in category 2. Email tasks are in that category for me. I used to leave all my email-related tasks in separate folders (or worse my inbox) and wait for them to stand out. I lived in fear that I would miss deadlines on some of them and occasionally did. As I've written before, I am absolutely thrilled that Goodtodo has managed my email tasks by allowing me to send them to a specific date (i.e., rather than have a waiting on category, I send a receipt for a purchase to a date when I expect to have received it by and only see that task/email on that day). I've had an empty inbox every day since using it and have even gotten to many fun email tasks (watching videos, reading links) that used to be trashed when my inbox was jammed. <br><br>So how should one deal with the other category 2 tasks? Organize them by context a la GTD? AF them? DIT them? Prioritize them? Develop routines for them (as for housekeeping)? My personal experience is that any of these methods can be helpful save for mixing them up too much with category 1's or category 3's. Doing so is what makes me feel overwhelmed and takes my eye off category 1's. I often take a category 2 task and convert it to a category 1. For example, I have a speech due on Saturday. What *must* I do today to be fully prepared? That's a category 1 that is on today's Goodtodo.<br><br>I have continued to do all categories of tasks as they stand out without using a list. But I also add category 1's and 2's to Goodtodo. The way I avoid overwhelm is by reviewing the day's list and redating or deleting tasks that aren't going to get done today. Thus I convert every day's list to a will-do list that requires no prioritization--very much in line with Mark's philosophy. I also have a DIT kind of focus. If I get an email today that needs a response, I send it to tomorrow's Goodtodo list. When tomorrow is here and I can respond to it, great. If I know I won't, I redate it to a time I most likely can. My goal is to do at least one thing tomorrow on projects that come in today. If I can't, I don't sweat it, but at least I have a guideline for working.</div>

<div class="content">My problem with todo lists is:<br><br>1. I find it hard to get into the habit of adding all tasks to it - so they end up representing only part of what I have to do - the rest is in my head so of course it takes away one of the biggest benefits which is having everything on one please<br><br>2. I find it hard to remember to consult my todo list - especially when I am in a fast flowing day.  Then when I get around to it, I find all the stuff I have forgotten to do!<br><br>I don't think there is much hope for me at all.</div>

<div class="content">Alison, the only way it works in a busy context is if it's blatently always in front of you so you can't forget.  A yellow notebook sitting in your view space will get you to look at it regularly.  If not, put stronger reminders in place until you become regular.  A flashing neon sign.<br><br>Mel, I'm with you on separating the will-dos from the maybes.  But when do you get to the "like to do maybe" list?  For a time I have been separating my stuff into "working on it" and "not working on it".  The "working on it" stuff is my AF4 list.  The "not working on it" stuff I will want to work on someday, like when I get some current projects finished.  Every new thing goes there.  I'll dismiss them if I never want to work on it, or I'll activate them by doing some work.  Each time I scan the AF4 open list I also scan the not-working-on-it stuff to see if I want to start working on anything.</div>

<div class="content">Alison, there's always hope. ;-) If it's something that's very time sensitive, I send myself a text message on my iPhone. I've made it a rule to look at my phone whenever a message comes in even if I think I *know* what it is because I am often wrong!<br><br>Alan: Several of those maybe items I will just do. No need to consult a list. If I had them in a list, I would peruse them during breaks or free time. I've adopted the mindset that if I don't ever remember to do a maybe again, it wasn't worth doing. Even when I do write maybes or various hair-brained ideas down, I typically forget where I left the list and just rely on my memory anyway.</div>

<div class="content">Alison:<br><br>It is a habit, and habits take a bit of time to get established. Persistence is the key.<br><br>As Alan suggests, make sure the list is prominent and where you can't miss it while you are working.<br><br>Make "look at to do list" the first thing you do each day. Don't allow yourself to do anything else first.</div>

<div class="content">Thank you everyone for your suggestions - you are right of course - after so many years of being disorganised and fire fighting it will take a little time to get used to a new way of working.<br><br>I find establishing new habits rewarding but they take time - expecially as I get older!</div>
