<div class="content">The problem with keeping things in your head as opposed to writing them down in some formal manner is that you are lacking a corrective. You are just holding your thoughts, if that, but you are not developing them.<br><br>If you take out time in order to think/meditate, I would concede that maybe some mental techniques (aka thinking, meditating) could be more effective than writing about the subject matter.<br><br>Other than that I would suggest we all experienced the power of written lists in some way or another at some point.<br><br>Instead of merely being a No List system, DREAMS is a No List At All system, as is Time Surfing if I got that right.<br><br>In Dreams there are no task lists or time blocks, one just does by Pull Mode, but there is the "What's better?" list, a list of reflections.<br><br>In observing Time Management Systems I found that the oppugnant technique to writing down tasks is to engaging in some form of REVIEWing technique. Journaling, question techniques, the  "What's better?" list and so on.<br><br>This seems to be suffice to assure that one works on the right tasks. Reviewing does more than that of course…<br><br>But I would suggest that you need at least either one: writing down tasks and goals or engaging in regular reviewing.<br><br>You can have both of course and reviewing will off-load a lot of weight off of the task list. Serial No-List is probably playing in this arena as well.<br><br>Anyway, there seem to be two type of persons in the discussion. Those that deem using an app as the default and for whom writing down something on paper is a special operation, and then those that don't mind about that at all, but find that using an app involves a learning curve and therefore is a special operation.<br><br>In the former camp there is lately making the rounds an interesting idea of how to look at your day's work:<br><br>Fill - Empty - Use<br><br>Here's the link to the original source:<br><a href="http://thedankoe.com/letters/why-productivity-advice-is-ruining-your-life/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://thedankoe.com/letters/why-productivity-advice-is-ruining-your-life/</a><br><br>Here's an implementation I found inspiring:<br><a href="http://www.tiktok.com/@daywithdandan/video/7192997344269323525" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.tiktok.com/@daywithdandan/video/7192997344269323525</a><br><br>He mentions journaling, he als mentions planning. Anyway, I think this framework lends itself as a starting point for a No-List-At-All existence.</div>
