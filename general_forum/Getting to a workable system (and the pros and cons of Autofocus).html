<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-01-18 23:34</div>
<div class="content">I'm new here (so take it easy on me!).   I've been trying to find/create a workable time management since reading Covey's "7 Habits" in the mid 90's, and have been an on-and-off GTD aficionado since 2001.   I've spent a good part of my 'organizational' time since then trying to find the perfect tool to implement GTD (the best of which I found to be Zoot and Ecco).   But I almost never did my "weekly reviews" and also usually ended up with so many "next actions" that I'd feel overwhelmed when looking for what to do.   I eventually resorted to going through the list and picking out the most important tasks for each day to view as a separate list -- but then would often end up procrastinating since those tasks were usually the hardest to do - and those daily lists would tend to get too long as well.<br><br>I've read many but not all of the posts here, and know very little about DIT, so excuse my ignorance if I miss important points, but I wanted to express what I like and dislike about Autofocus, and then turn to what a workable system for me would look like:<br><br>What's appealling to me about Autofocus:<br>-----------------------------------------<br>-Very easy to add new tasks<br>-Single list to manage, no weekly reviews necessary<br>-Feeling of accomplishment from picking out a task, working on it, and crossing it off the list<br>-Keeping me productive by allowing/enabling me to work on what I "feel like" working on<br>-Keeping in touch with all my tasks through relatively frequent scanning of the list<br><br>What's unappealling to me about Autofocus:<br>------------------------------------------<br>-No prioritization: I could see myself spending lots more time on a myriad of less important tasks, such as maintaining my PC, cleaning my desk, etc., than the harder but more important tasks related to my business...<br><br>-No project-level planning:  I've seen the suggestions that this could/should be done outside Autfocus, but would prefer a single system that could manage project planning and the related tasks that are generated.  Also I worry that many tasks that really are not "next actions" will clog up the lists (but not be dissmissed since many will still be important).<br><br>-No notes:  Related to the above, I think it would be best for any task I'm working on to be directly linked to notes and/or the project related to the task.   Having to find this info in a separate system from the task list seems inefficient.<br><br>-Little sense at the beginning of a day of what I plan to accomplish for that day, and difficult to tell at the end of the day what I've done that day...  (or week)<br><br>-No contexts:  As others have mentioned, it is occasionally useful to see just errands, or phone calls, etc...<br><br>-What to do when I think of an urgent new task to do:  It seems to me that it would ruin the system to work on things without putting them in the system, but putting an immediately urgent task at the end of the last page wouldn't work either...<br><br>What a workable system for me might look like<br>---------------------------------------------<br>Purpose:  Accomplish my most important objectives and be happy with what I'm doing and have done every day and week.<br><br>Main Attributes<br>	*Makes sure that important and urgent projects/tasks get done on time <br>	*Easy to add new actions/tasks<br>	*Easy to select which action to do now (and have info to do it)<br>	*Can tell what I'm going to do and how I've spent my time<br>	*Motivates productivity and minimizes procrastination/time-wasting<br><br>Ideally, the system would:<br>*Combine project-level planning which generate "next actions" with tasks that are added in real-time<br>*Include time estimates, some sense of urgency and importance of each task, and optionally, context and due date (and automatically record date entered)<br>*Link tasks to their associated project (so would be simple to find notes and pick out next actions when complete this action)<br>*Have a "day planning" mode that, based on amount of free time available (ideally, automatically calculated from calendar), picks out the most important/urgent tasks that would fill that free time (adding up the time as you go), including a mix of important/hard tasks and easy/urgent tasks...  <br>*Have an analogous planning mode for the week (though, not necessary)<br>*Have a way to select and automatically record time spent on each task today(including those pre-selected and those not), so at end of day, could see where the time went (as compared to the schedule and estimates)<br><br>To do this, it seems to me that I would use ideas/tools from GTD for the project-planning, Outlook for the calendar, a program called TimeTo for the "free-time" task planning, and ideas from AutoFocus to select which of the daily tasks to work on (i.e. once I have a list of tasks for the day, use the scanning and "standing out" concepts to select each task to work on).   But that means using 3 different tools (Outlook, TimeTo, and GTD software) and 3 different systems (GTD, AutoFocus, and Outlook), which is far from ideal...<br><br>Sorry for this long-winded post, but I have been inspired to think about all this after hearing about AutoFocus and needed to get this all out.  (And, BTW, re: the Myers Briggs post, I'm INTP)<br><br>I'd very much appreciate any comments, suggestions and other thoughts on time management.<br></div>

<div class="content">David,<br><br>I too have shared some of your thoughts appeal/not appealing.<br><br>Here are comments that occur me after reading your post, and my way of going towards what you name "a workable system" (and makes me slightly drift away from pure AF)<br>(Sorry if this has grown as a long post).<br><br>f.i. Even not playing GTD, I do find weekly review is a habit to keep : although playing AF digital allows filtering or sorting, I didn't find it makes a convenient tool for reviewing. Same for contexts : why not keep them with AF if you need.<br><br>Note : if you need notes, links or contexts I do not think it is AF-forbidden. Not practical on paper, but easy if digital. I do have notes , tags (who, where...) or links (to docs, notes to work with) for quite a lot of my items [Quite often, I first jot short ideas in a note first, then recap my needed action in the title !]<br>Friday I was not at ease when on the phone a partner asked me when so and so would be ready for her : I knew I wrote about three items for the so and so but (maybe my fault because I wanted to answer her on the spot) I had to rely on my memory to check if my wordings fitted with hers, and felt uncomfortable to commit a date. My memory was not too bad (thanks to AF cycling), but not as precise I ought to. Thus, I fear too many things will drift from my AF list as traditional priorities ticklered in datebook (AF exceptions).<br>That's why I revert to my former system, more workable for me, but that I'll parallelize (?) the more I can with Mark's findings.<br><br><br>The workable system you describe :<br><br>I agree with your criteria, but you end with what I feel an overcomplicated system : 3 tools + 3 systems !<br> As for the systems , just have one (that may encompass non exclusive elements borrowed from your prefered systems ). Yes, it may take some time to think and fine tune it.<br><br>As for the tools I think it should be a bifold combo : Date data (life, action), and reference (knowledge, work). AF is on the Date side, but obviously as to be supplemented.<br><br>You say you use TimeTo (this programm is a somewhat reengineered version of Above&Beyond 2001 which had been left for free a couple of months) : you know you can use it in an AF mode as soon as you divide the priority list in "pages".<br><br>Or...<br>... if you dare you may tweak some Mark's rules (after your risks/benefits analysis !) to better accomodate to your needs.<br><br><br>Here is the way I use A&B :<br>* Default view is the (badly named) priority list : you can at any moment add new items (I betray AF because I insert them in a somewhat urgency order instead of appending). <br>* I use the priority letter to divide the list ;  #1 for each letter is a red divider : #A1 : I commit now, #B1 : ASAP, #C1 : If I want to, #D1 : for pleasure, etc. That eases browsing through hundreds of items. That looks contrary to AF rules, but wait ! <br>* I jot in the list any thought that might imply some use of my time on everything (alike with AF) <br>* I've set default item as a float (no date) with a short duration (so A&B computes too many things to do in its proposed schedules). <br>* I click the project color box for project or life domain * I "tickler" each item, that is I enter a deadline (real or fake) : if not when close to the deadline, I get an alert and then I choose to hard code (exception), reject, or dismiss (ie : reword with a new "deadline". I may enter a specific duration and open days or hours if it helps. <br>* I use status (right click) to color code type of item or context. <br>* if I need a note, I just jot operative details needed in that instance, or a link to reference database<br><br>Of course I also enter in schedules hard landscape items (allocated times, routines...).<br><br>You know A&B (or TimeTo) computes "optimized" daily schedules out of hard landscape and the list of float items according to your time specs and order in the list.<br><br>==> I do not use these schedules as my timetable for the day, but alike AF pages ! <==<br><br>That is, (except for allocated times) I use today, to morrow and the day after tomorrow as *picking-lists* where I choose what stands out for me at the moment, almost as told in AF rules cycling !<br><br>OK, this is not AF, but not so far : you may progress on anything of some interest for you, and have a rather good balance between rationale (sense of duty) and intuition (fit and pleasure).<br><br>As I plan to revert back to this system, I'll be now even more sytematic in the "little but often" mode, and I won't feel anymore guilty if after doing some of a "today" item I prefer to work a "little" on a "tomorrow" item.<br><br>Thus my twofolded tools are : <br>* A&B for time, and TheBrain (swichted to it from Evernote beginning of year) for reference. <br>* If on the road (or anywhere not at reach of my computer) : Palm datebook and memos (or alike for other devices).<br><br>As for the system, it is unique but elaborated with different levels and rythms, in which I integrate parts of existing systems that fits me.<br><br>---<br><br>I do not know if I am allowed to stay on the forum, as I won't be a true beta tester now :) I wish to go on reading numerous ideas and trials here, and maybe, better weight what I am at a risk to miss !<br><br>Of course, Mark, I'm still willing to translate further AF developments if you please.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the replies.<br><br>Sylvia: I have read and followed the instructions best I could, and read the "amendments" post just before I made my post.    I just don't know how "exceptions" work within the system (it seems, by definition, they're outside the system).<br><br>Jacques:  I appreciate your detailed post - and you do seem to have a good way of adding prioritization to AF (since A&B will put the tasks in order of A, B, C, etc.).  But how do your incorporate project-planning in your system?   Also, I *like* the feature of TimeTo that enables you to see what tasks will actually fit into a day (I tend to overschedule and underestimate time for tasks as it is, so the shorter the list for a day, the better for me!).    You're also right that notes (and probably contexts) are easy to incorporate into an electronic system.    The real issues for me are prioritization, project-planning (so I'm working on the correct next-action(s) for my projects), and finding the right balance between avoiding overwhelm and having enough of a choice to find something productive to do at any point I'm at my desk at work...<br></div>

<div class="content">David :<br><br>Project planning (look in the forum, there is already a thread here about it) is not at ground level (personal, use of my time) but at the upper level (organisation, mutual commitments, coordinating with others). So the specific tools you use in your organisation are reference docs you link to in your todo list.<br><br>In other words : one tasks I commit to at project planning level is translated in several todos in my list.<br><br><br>Others :<br><br>Reading my former answer to David, I probably overcomplicated and lost those who are not acquainted with A&B/TimeTo.<br><br>Let's put my AF tweak like this :<br><br>I have a servant which brings me a list of three pages with my fixed times, my urgent todos, and then other todos of any size/kind I might work a little at the moment (about 30 to 60). The servant proposes this pages as workable schedules as if I was highly productive and always rational. As I am neither of both, I choose next  thing to do according to urgency, pressure, intuition, and expected pleasure !<br><br>Unlike AF rules, when I begin the day, or come back to the list after leaving it for a while, I resume slow pace reading at top page.<br><br>So, with this one servant (A&B/TimeTo), I presently have the feeling of getting the best of both worlds, productive side and creative side.<br><br>Nevertheless I listen to others experiments and success stories, and if I dicover I am getting wrong (ie I block potential opportunities of better managing my time), I'll aknowledge it, no problem.<br><br><br><br></div>

<div class="meta">2009-01-19 13:31</div>
<div class="content">Jacques, like you my "routine" is to work on my lists (in my case paper and update the computer at the end of the day but I think Jay's post sums up one of the major benefits - it "does not tie us down to a PC" and "entries can be short and sweet".<br><br>I can totally relate to the concerns that David M and Jacques express; just because I am finding AF an unbelievably effective tool does not mean I do not have really critical items in there, and yes I have been concerned that things will be missed.  What for me though has been the key is realising that my subconscious or intuition actually knows best.  My belief system has always been that my rational mind knows best - it is incredibly hard to give that control away - even to ourselves!<br><br>I really believe that a lot of our difficulties with AF result from this, and that our need to tweak the system, digitalise it, or in some other way change it, is part of that rational desire to be in control.  Have I added tweaks to the system?  Of course!  Have they worked?  Some have and some have not.  What I have found is that the system works as written - if we let it - and that really is the hard part because it goes so against our ingrained belief that, for a TM system to work it must be (a) structured and (b) make us feel in control.  AF does enable us to be in control *but* not in the way we expect.<br><br>Also, the fact is, that for us to be in the position where we recognise the need for an effective system, we are almost without exception in a position of overwhelm, with more to do than can ever be done in the time we feel is available, and with a pretty fixed and long held sense of panic hovering over us.  That is a difficult place to start from. Rationality says "Relax? Go with the flow? Are you kidding me?  You have NO idea what I have to do?!!!!"   Actually that is basically irrelevant because whatever you do you can *never* fit more than 24 hours into one day.  What AF does, is that it frees the mind from that sense of panic and overload and enables the time that we spend "doing" to be 100% productive, rather than the probably minimal percentage it was when we were trying to do it "our way" (rationally).  Yes we may have had structure and discipline, but did we ever feel 100% productive?<br><br>Do I still have critical items? Yes.  Do I still feel a sense of panic?  Occasionally yes - but certainly rarely and now I *can* do something about that.  What I do know is that I really believe that my time is as close to 100% productive as I have ever known in my life.  Do I still have too much to do?  Absolutely yes but that is a fault of my pre AF way of working (or not!) and for the first time I can see that that can be overcome.<br><br>I honestly believe that the impact of AF makes Jan 5 a significant date in my life - did I become miraculously organised overnight? No.  Did all my problems dissapear? No. But I can see that by working with AF I will get to place where my backlog can be dealt with, where I be free to do what I want to rather than resenting the use of most of my time, and basically getting my life back!  Am I there yet?  No - but I *am* on my way!  <br><br>Sorry guys - major soapbox there and I know not everyone will agree with me , but I really do think this is important.  It is immensely hard to let go of what can almost become a security blanket of stress and overwhelm - it is familiar and has been around for a long time!  Since starting AF other people are even noticing a difference and telling me I look less stressed - and to me that says it all!  My ENTJ-ness now feels free to want to go and party!!</div>

<div class="content">Christine:  That is an inspirational post (and I've appreciated your other posts as well), and I can see that getting close to 100% productive might be worth giving up some control.   But why not add some sense of prioritization to AF (perhaps along the lines Jacques suggests)?   One would still be enabling the intuitive mind to pick amongst many things to do, but it would seem one would be even more relaxed knowing that the higher priority items are all at the front of the list...<br><br>Jacques:  Re: projects, my hope is not to clog up my task list unnecessarily with multiple tasks per project (when only one task is a "next action" after a little thought), or to leave out the best next action entirely.    Perhaps one way to do it to avoid using a separate system is to list project:action in the task list so that there is only one action per project (when appropriate) and the basic project planning info can be in the notes for the item (as suggested in TimeTo help for GTD).   <br><br>Jay:  If my work was not at the computer I could see much more value in the paper lists, but pretty much all my non-appointment work gets done at the computer, and when I'm not at my desktop I usually have a laptop or blackberry.   And I value the ability of the computer to remind me of my appointments and to keep track of what I'm doing otherwise...  (with respect to keeping and referencing notes as well as keeping track of my time).<br><br>Thanks again for the comments.</div>

<div class="content">Another interesting discussion to come home to after being away over the weekend!<br><br>David M:<br><br>Do you think the fact that you got overwhelmed with "next actions" and never did the "weekly reviews" could have something to do with the complexity of the system you were trying to work?<br><br>If so, do you think that the answer might be to use a system which is as simple as possible?<br><br>You see, my problem with the system you describe as being your ideal is that it would require an immense overhead to keep it going. You would have to remember to add times, priorities, project description, links, etc, etc, etc. How on earth are you ever going to keep that going?<br><br>The great thing about AF is that it has no overheads at all. All you do is write tasks on the end of a list. That's it!<br><br>If you sometimes have to spend a few minutes looking for a document because there is no link to it, so what?

<div class="content">Mark, that's a great observation about the effort of maintaining a system.  It always bothered me that so many systems had that maintenance element and I think that was a significant factor in my ultimately giving up.<br><br>David, my prioritisation comes from my schedule, and same day items list. My projects identify their own prioritisation through natural progression and their associated tasks are added into AF in the appropriate place (schedule, AF page or same day list).  That provides that level of comfort - to me anything else would be imposing my rational degree of urgency or importance on remaining items.</div>

<div class="content">I've been confused looking at a number of different posts since the launch of Autofocus that some folks seem to want a system to do everything for them. Surely Autofocus is a 'time management' system. Something that helps you organise your time to achieve the things you 'want' to achieve. From my understanding it doesn't include, scheduled tasks (those happening at a set time on a set day), higher level planning (project organisation) - although it can help move a project along just fine by the simple inclusion of 'work on project x', etc.<br><br>Why do folks think that a time management system will somehow run their complete lives for them.<br><br>And one more thing before I step down from my soap box - without action no system of any kind, time management or otherwise, is ever going to achieve anything. I don't mean to put anyone down and this is definitely not directed at the originator of this or any other post. It's just I'm confused by some of the questions and problems some people ask/have. It's as if they want all the answers to their problems answered for them by magic.<br><br>Over time I have come to the conclusion I have to take what I can from things that I find useful but also make things work for me. Without this sort of approach (experiment and tweak) I don't think Mark could keep coming up with all of his great ideas.<br><br>I'll shut up now!!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark ... I have started using the AutoFocus and want to give some feedback ... I hope this is a good place to do it.<br><br>I was so hyped up last night when I skimmed the first part of your email that I started a notebook right away and couldn't sleep for a couple of hours because I felt so joyful and relieved!!<br><br>For me I know this is going to work.  I have used a similar system for decades ... but this has some important differences.  I had (until last night) used old envelopes to keep track of the many things to do and not forget.  It got too bulky over the years and too hard to find them and keep on top of them.  The system really broke down a couple of years ago when I got very sick again ... so things piled up too much without enough crossing off the lists .. so they got chaotic.<br><br>So the idea of having them ALL in one place is really fantastic for me.  I know it is going to work!  I have usually used that method of scanning lists to see what pops out - it is what works best for me.  But you have added a structure to it that I really like.<br><br>I am extremely excited and plan to send out your link to some other artists that I know are overwhelmed by the online stuff and how to prioritize all that we can do.  I am so happy because the overwhelm is not there right now ... and I know this will really help - because a similar thing is always how I have gotten out of it before.<br><br>But that structure of it will KEEP it at bay!!  <br><br>I plan to post about this tonight - not any details (as you said) - but that something is working for me and that they too can go be a tester. <br><br>Thank you so much!

<div class="content">Hannah<br><br>I could not agree more - and the alarming thing is that all these mods and cons are just symptoms of procrastination and resistance.<br><br>Ultimately, time management is a decision. The question is very simple: "What do I do now?".<br><br>Some people spend (waste) their time trying to build and maintain a system that gives them the "right" answer, or at least some approximation to it.<br><br>I reckon if you were to bring all the influential thinkers on time management together, the one thing they would agree on is that no system will ever come up with this answer.

<div class="content">Mark:  Thanks for responding.  And I hope it's OK that I'm questioning the system in this forum.  You're right in that too much overhead is a problem.  But the other end of the spectrum is to have no overhead or list at all and simply do whatever you're thinking about in the moment.  That would be a completely intuitive and easy approach, but some important tasks and projects would likely not get done on time and one may end up working a lot, but not efficiently.  So, some overhead is useful, and then it's a question of where to strike the balance.  I may be mistaken, but the beta version of AF strikes me as being on the side of having not enough overhead to make sure that projects get done on time and that the right tasks are getting done as opposed to any tasks.  <br><br>For example, I have on my AF list to post my questions about AF on this forum.  And since this is such an interesting discussion, that is the task that appeals to me when I look at the list.  But I have a sense of unease about higher priority/urgency tasks further down the list (and on other pages) that are not getting done today...<br><br>But you're right that what I describe is not the answer either, esp. if it involves multiple tools and systems and too much data entry.  Hence my questioning of how to get to a workable system (knowing that a 'perfect' or 'ideal' system is not achievable).<br><br>Christine:  How do you create and manage your "same day list"?    And, how, in general, are "exceptions" managed for urgent tasks?<br><br>Hannah:  I see where you're coming from, and I'm sure folks would love to have a time management system actually do things for them (and I suppose that they do with respect to culling less important tasks), or tell them how to live their lives, but I don't think anyone rational actually expect that.   And I apologize if I came across that I expect that.  Essentially what I'm looking for is a system that helps me figure out how to use my time most efficiently/productively towards getting things done that are important to me.  And my purpose in posting here is to leverage the great experience and ideas of Mark and the folks in this forum to help find such a system... <br><br>Andy: I admit I am one of those people - and that's why I'm here.  But it's been 7 years since I've worked on building a new time management system.  I've realized that "pure" GTD is good at managing projects, but relatively poor at answering the "What do I do now" question.   And it seems that AF is good at getting one to do something productive in the moment, but I wonder if some hybrid of GTD, AF and some other ideas might be even better at helping one be efficient at completing high priority projects and manage and track their time as well as being productive at working on tasks...<br><br></div>

<div class="content">BTW, re: projects, my hope is to reduce overall overhead.  Keeping project management out of AF reduces the overhead of AF, but it seems to me that it increases overall overhead by requiring a separate project management system where task status needs to be moved between the two systems.  <br><br>It seems that it would be better if there was a single system that enabled one to plan projects, generate the actions needed to move those projects forward, and then provided an intuitive method to choose which of those actions to work on in the moment when combined with all the other random tasks one has to do....</div>

<div class="content"><br>David M,<br>Welcome to AF.  Since you opened the door to receiving feedback, I offer the following. As a recovering GTDaholic, I identify with many of your thoughts and reservations about AF. I practiced Covey from 1994 to until 2001 when I read GTD. When I finished the book, I read it over. Allen's thinking about organizing  oneself to get things done blew me away. (At one point, I was so enchanted by  the rationality and good sense of GTD, I nearly became a stalker of David Allen. While driving northbound on CA HWY 101, I happened to  see him driving in the lane next to me, and, for the next thirty miles of driving, I wrestled with the impulse to follow him home and tell him what a fan I was. I did not follow through with that particular fantasy. )<br>GTD made so much sense to me - Eureka!, Of course a life organized around contexts would be my key to getting things done.  Everything about about a GTD organized universe makes so much sense to me.  <br><br>The problem is, it never worked.  Or, I should say, it didn't work because the lists, while fun to make, and the projects, while satisfying to chunk down, were dead once they were made.  Distributing my life activities into contexts became a labyrinthian jumble of expanding and contracting contexts, projects that were broken down into sequential or parallel tasks to the nth degree, and the result of all this arranging was total snow blindness; immobility caused by a universe of choices. Summoning the will to move forward on a project was onerous and near impossible.  It is right here, where the GTD system attains a critical mass of complexity,  is where resistance, procrastination and avoidance kept their stronghold.  GTD didn't work as a sustainable getting- things-done system because  it was missing the employment of my entire mind.  GTD has such glorious and attractive logic, but is empty of soul. <br><br>Here are some of my thoughts on GTD inspired improvements:<br><br>"Time estimates and levels of urgency" -  If the system asks me or even has an optional column for "priority" I am sunk. I will now be sucked into the trap of having to expend precious energy choosing priority rather than choosing to act. What was an amazing discovery about doing AF is that it put me back in touch with a mechanism that within nanoseconds can determine time estimates, levels of urgency and priority.  It's called my mind.<br><br>"Project planning" - great. Projects should be listed. They should be broken down into incremental tasks. Some of these tasks will drift over to the AF pages. But, never, ever will the project planning pages dictate to the AF pages. In fact, in order to actually make progress on my projects, keep my project planning as far away from AF as possible. The Project Planner is utterly impotent at getting stuff done. He is a fine planner but a horrible doer.  Project planning pages are forever subordinate because they are partialities. Bits of logic-mind distillations that exist in the fantasy world of some minority portion of my intelligence. <br><br>"Links" -  The activity of creating links seems so logically simple but the effort to create the links, maintain the links, evaluate the links has again sucked me into the mire of me serving the system rather than the system serving me. Inventing ways to have all data at my fingertips is a perfect way to avoid actually doing something.<br><br>"Day Planning" mode - This is a perfect description of what AF does out of the box. AF employs a sophisticated algorithm that based on the amount of free time available (including data input from a calendar) picks out the most important/urgent or important/not-urgent task  and that would fill that free time, records both time and completion, and includes a mix of important/hard tasks and easy/important tasks.<br><br>"Record of Time spent" - Again AF does this quite effortlessly and even simplifies it into terms my child understands. I can say to her, "Today I completed 35 tasks in 6 hours. Yesterday I completed 24 tasks in 8.5 hours. Tomorrow I will do 40."  Should my child require more detail, it is a simple calculation to see how many work tasks were completed or how many personal tasks completed.  <br><br>As I mentioned in an earlier post, in the short time I have been using AF, I have accomplished more in less time, taken action to complete projects that have been lingering for years and  have been reunited with the creative and intuitive side of myself.<br><br>Good luck with the 3 systems. I, myself, have experienced that particular siren song and the craggy shores, and will head in the opposite direction.</div>

<div class="content">David M<br><br>With regard to your specific question regarding "same day lists", the honest answer is that until today I didn't have one.  Yes, I had a schedule for appointments, generally relied on my memory for routines and dealt with new things as they came up by deciding whether to add them to my list or just doing them (but only if I felt they warranted same day action).  I have found that most "need to's" are getting done automatically (they are usually on my list but I cannot say they always get picked up when reviewing that page) as part of a normal day.  To use a simple example, if I have clean the sink on my list, it is quite likely to have been done when waiting for the kettle to boil and so is already completed by the time I get to the page.  While I am doing that sort of task on an automatic basis that feels right to me within the system.  The alternative would be to say "I can't do that now, I'm not on that page" which would be ridiculous - and not even rational :-)  I did feel I was getting behind in a couple of areas, eg checking email, but was reviewing it quickly and felt that AF would pick that up.  In fact it prompted me to simplify my email system, which I actually wouldn't necessarily have considered had I forced the email checking.<br><br>Going back to "same day list", when I saw Mark's posting about Index Cards interestingly I had an immediate and quite negative reaction!  If the suggestion had not been from Mark I would probably just have dismissed it out of hand, but I tucked the idea away to see what happened.  Firstly I realised that my reaction was to "index cards", probably due to the fact that I have been immensely frustrated by any system I have tried in the past that has had any reliance on index cards.  I then added an item to my list "find system 4 same day tasks" because I knew it was important, but not, for me at that time, urgent.  It was only today that I acted on that task.<br><br>Interestingly the reason I acted on it today is very much tied in with your comment regarding this forum. As you might have guessed I have spent a fair bit of time on the forum today and I wanted to look at that.  My first thought was that I had been procrastinating but it didn't feel like that.  I had spent the time on the forum that I "felt" like, but it seemed that that *must* surely have been too long.  However, what I realised was, that in reading posts and considering them, looking at what was going on for me with AF, and responding, I was actually really crystallising my thoughts and consolidating on them, and actually feel as though I have almost moved up a gear if that makes sense.  When I looked back at what I had done today I found that I had in any event already crossed off 29 items.<br><br>I was feeling that perhaps I had missed something urgent but suddenly the way to keep *my* "same day list" became clear to me so I actioned it, although I have to confess I was not on the relevant page at the time :-).   My "list" is a page from an A6 notebook and has three items which to me are "same day items" every day so I have them with a line underneath. They are as follows:<br><br>Check email<br>Coffee<br>Eat<br><br>.... the latter being prompted by the fact that my rumbling stomach at 4 pm reminded me that I hadn't.  Under the line I will write any same day urgent tasks and use the list as recommended.  Whilst conducting my internal "procrastination" debate - did I/did'nt I? - I was sure I must have missed some urgent items today because I had not worked through lots of pages.  I checked and was surprised to find that I was wrong. Urgent items? Yes.  Important items?  Yes. But only one item that *needs* to be actioned today which was  a prayer request regarding something happening this evening. Nothing else had that "same day urgency".   With regard to exceptions I just try to follow Mark's common sense rule and "just do it".<br><br>Hope that helps a little (sorry, a long answer to a short question!)</div>

<div class="content">David M<br><br>That's a very thoughtful response. FWIW I spent some 4 years struggling with GTD and whilst I did feel more in control I never felt as productive as I have with AF. And yes, I read all the forums, tried all the tools and, even when I knew it was really about the process and the habits, I still resisted and procrastinated by hiding behind the impossible goal of a perfect system.<br><br>The reality or course is that we are talking about peoples lives and that everyone is, thankfully, different. Some of GTD has worked for me and I still keep those as part of my overall "system".<br><br>In particular, the value of a hard landscape (ie a calendar) and the need to keep it sacred territory; a projects list; mind-sweeps; an Agendas list. All of these are still part of my system<br><br>For day to day actiond though, it is all in my AF list including items such as "Review Projects", "Review next weeks calendar", "Mind-sweep" and it really works. I do get round to these things and quite quickly I am beginning to understand what adds value and what doesn't.<br><br>Suprisingly, it is the "Projects" list that will probably be the first to go. I am now working on my important projects pretty much everyday via AF - the projects list is redundant because, as long as I update the AF list, nothing is falling through the cracks.<br><br>This requires a huge leap of faith but honestly, since starting AF, nothing has gone undone, I have not missed any deadlines and I have been more productive.<br><br>All the best, <br>Andy</div>

<div class="content">When I started trying out AF, I was skeptical because it didn't seem to offer a lot of the trappings of time management I was accustomed to, like prioritization and scheduling and contexts and etc. Huge impossible flaws with AF, I thought, and pounded my head on it for a while. <br><br>Then I realized: I'm looking for another shiny new solution because my current time management systems *aren't working*. I always have too much to do and not enough time to do it and get overwhelmed and panicky. They all sound great but in the end, weren't entirely effective at helping me get stuff done. If these things are *so* great and *so* essential, why haven't they *already* worked for me? <br><br>Maybe, just maybe, they aren't so great and essential. <br><br>Once  I entertained the possibility that I didn't need all the cruft of former systems, I could give AF a fair chance, instead of trying to morph it into another version of my old systems. <br><br>It works better for me in its original form, without tweaking for prioritization and contexts and tags and schedules and etc.</div>

<div class="content">David:<br><br>I'm having trouble with the way you are using the expression 'project management'. If you buy a book about Project Management it will cover a completely different set of subjects from a Time Management book. It will include all sort of things like flow charts, Gantt charts, profit and loss analyses, feasibility studies, etc. <br><br>If you're just talking about how to keep track of the things which you're personally involved in, what are you doing that is so complicated that it can't be dealt with in AF?</div>

<div class="content">David<br><br>Re Project Planning there are a number of posts on this subject and the following links may help<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/623306" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/623306</a><br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/625387" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/625387</a> <br><br>I firmly believe that AF is working better than any other system I found with regard to project planning but you have to remember that a project by definition is normally large and has "stuff" whether real or virtual, and that that stuff has to be contained.  No system of lists can ever do that - if an item needs to be in a box it needs to be in a box, if in a database then that is where it needs to be.<br><br>I certainly believe there are ways of managing that stuff in an AF type system but that has more to do with actual project set up, control and management.  I am a great believer that a project "system" should fit with the individual but to create or tailor make that system takes time. (Shouts of glee from all those who love systems to tweak!)  I work very much on the principle that a project management system can be created much like a fiitted bedroom - it is tailored to the space but has a lot of standard components.  There are a lot of components that are excellent but a lot more factors define whether a system works for you and recommending those components would not help without reviewing all of the other factors.  It would be like saying "great, you need a fitted bedroom.  I can recommend a really nice drawer, oh and there's an excellent coathanger I know of!"  What is needed is to sit down and work out exactly what you need, enlist the services of a project planner (no pun intended!) and create the fitted bedroom you need for your specific space.  Mark's first book contained numerous ideas and techniques but I would guaratee that no 2 people reading this forum would have used exactly the same techniques in exactly the same way.   You need a system for your projects that works for you - and AF will more than likely enable to identuify what that will look like......<br></div>

<div class="content">What a great thread! <br><br>My take on AF is that it need not be tinkered with, it's just about perfect as a system can get. I think the added desire to adjust or customize it, is have it do beyond what it is basically tailored for. <br><br>While this system will keep you productive with very little overhead, we also want to steer ourselves toward goals. While it's true a combination of intuition and little rationality makes for better decisions, if our intuition/other than conscious processes were really that 'good', most people would be getting better results. I would be really interested to see long term results of AF for people who are very goal oriented.<br><br>As authors, coaches and psychologist often like to say: often your subconscious is  'tripping you up' from achieving certain goals, without you even realizing it. While I think AF does much better than any other system I've tried has, if your 'other than conscious' processing isn't making choices that will steer you to what you really want, you might be productive and feel productive, but productive towards what? <br><br>Let's say your goal is to double your wealth. One way of going about this is spending more time on 'earning' activities. For the sake of this example, let's suppose your beliefs don't really support you doubling your wealth. If you go on autopilot, you're not likely to make the necessary shift. Within AF, you're unlikely to consistently add and select tasks that will help you bring in more wealth. The two ways of approaching this more successfully is by making changes to your subconscious through any manner of tool (hypnosis for example). Or what most people do: try to exert conscious control over your direction by planning & implementing. <br><br>In other words, AF will facilitate FOCUS but it's still up to you to have the focus on things that bring in the results you really want. <br><br>So I think the urge to have control (or to at least steer) is very logical, if you want to achieve certain goals. And the great thing is,  I think you can have two systems, without any bloated overhead at all.<br><br>David, you mention the overhead issue would increase if you work with 2 systems (AF + some project/planning type of system), quite right. But what if you could apply AF without any extra work while you use another system? <br><br>My solution at the moment is to use AF in conjunction with my more structured system. When I figured I don't have to drop either, without suffering any added 'overhead' I thought 'AHA!'<br><br>I collect my tasks digitally through mindmanager, gyroq and resultsmanager. The latter two are add-in's from gyronix for mindmanager.  Basically I can have tasks in many areas, maps, files, contexts and have them grouped however I like them. To go into AF mode, I have Resultsmanager round up all the tasks, regardless of its location/context (with the click of a button (they call it a dashboard)). I still apply the closed lists/pages as in AF, by grouping a set number of tasks in a topic called page 'x'. To work in AF mode, I'll look at one set of tasks, treating it like I would a page. Work method is just like the instructions. In essence a digitalized AF version.<br><br>The flexibility here is that I can work multiple systems without adding more overhead. I can be really specific about certain projects and add any number of attributes to a task (like task status, next action, urgency etc), other projects I can be as loose as I want to (household stuff), once I work AF style, the automatic task collecting (done automatically by resultsmanager) doesn't look, care about, or alter any of the extra information. <br><br>I have found many more benefits to this, but this aha moment came just a few days ago, haven't had suffficient time to field test (so far so good though!)<br><br>Sound good?<br></div>

<div class="content">Wow - lots to think about!<br><br>Mark: Re: projects, I have responsibilities within a number of organizations.  If I simply write the name of the organization as a marker to move things forward there (as I've done in the past), it can be overwhelming, as I really need to think about what needs to be done (which may include subprojects).  Yes, that thinking can be an AF task, but then how do I record the list of projects/actions it generates?  If I enter all those actions into my AF lists, I feel my AF lists will become clogged with tasks that are dependent on other tasks getting done first.   And I feel that I will lose the benefit of that organizational  thinking if the subprojects and dependent tasks are not kept or linked together. <br><br>Stark:  Your background with GTD sounds very familiar (except perhaps for the stalking part :-)), but I really don't understand this statement: "in order to actually make progress on my projects, keep my project planning as far away from AF as possible"   Assuming that AF is your system for making progress on anything, and that you want to make progress on your projects, how is keeping them completely separate a good thing?<br><br>There's too many other good ideas and thoughts for me to respond to now and get anything done today.

<div class="content">Hi Peter<br><br>Excellent point about whether our beliefs are in conflict with our stated goals.  Without going too much into the psycholgy aspect I think our belief structures operate at different levels, some conscious and some sub-conscious, but I think that the benefit of the way AF works with the sub-conscious is to identify those conflicts, at which time we then have the choice as to what we do with that information.<br><br>At a basic level, the productivity increase is productivity with regard to the tasks we have put on the lists.  Those tasks will arise from from things we have to do, whether by necessity eg eat, or duty eg work (a very basic level).  Our productivity is therefore in accordance to what we believe are our goals (whether personal or imposed) at the time that we entered the relevant items. It is not by identifying the fact that resistance exists but by identifying the reason for that resistance that is so powerful.  One person has already posted that they have realised that their resistance comes from not being happy in his current job. Others have identified other reasons for resistance.  It is how we then use that information that determines where we go.<br><br>If I have the stated goal "to increase wealth" and rationally know that the way to achieve that is through "fee earning work" then it will soon become evident if I have a resistance to doing fee earning work.  My rational mind will probably convince me that I'm lazy or just useless and that is why i will never be rich.  However, in my experience so far, it seems that AF will make me ask the question "why do I want to increase wealth?".  If the answer to that is "so I can have a better car than Fred down the road" or something similar, and that conflicted with a belief that that sort of reason is selfish, then I will never want to do fee earning work.  If however I realise that the answer to the question is "so that I have more disposable income/time to solve world poverty" then realising that is the reason will effectively "give me permission" to follow that goal as being in line with my value system.<br><br>The key is being aware of those conflicts, identifying the causes, and acting on them. Yes there may be a need for outside help in changing perceptions that are from deep seated beliefs, but I think AF actually provides a safe environment to do that.  If a high resistance item is because of a deep seated issue (and this has been touched on in other posts) then the choice to deal with it or not is still a choice.  We can reject items.  We still have the option to review and if we have an item or pattern of item types that we keep rejecting then at some point that area will most likely be looked at and I suspect that there will always be people around willing to help at the right time.</div>

This shouldn't really be a problem.<br><br>Keeping things moving within a project and keeping all the plates spinning from all the different activities I might be involved in are the aspects of my life that I find Autofocus most useful for.

<div class="content">Stark's post reminded me of what a tortuous journey time management has been.

Only this last to-do list works.<br><br>You know what my greatest delight with AF is, apart from getting things done? It's completely killed the urge to hop online and check whether some genius has at last devised the piece of software that will make time management painless for me. It was a wasteful, destructive habit, nearly as bad as the procrastination that drove it. Now I have something that works, in an aesthetically pleasing and minimalist way, and look back on all the software, the forms, the systems, the organisers, the gadgets, as some type of long-lingering brain fever.

<div class="content">Hi Diane<br><br>I checked out your site after Sylvia's earlier post & love your art too!  <br><br>It is helpful to try to work through your lists as many times in a day as is practical.  Remember that you only HAVE to do one item per page, although of course more may stand out.  It can be difficult if some of those tasks require concentrated blocks of time - and you may find some of the posts on projects helpful<br><br>Handling Projects <br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/623306" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/623306</a><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/625387" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/625387</a> <br><br>Having more smaller tasks on the lists can help them to flow better - that may help with the email (it is very easy for that to pile up!) And by all means put routine tasks (like neck stretches) on your lists but they do need to be crossed off or the lists will never be cleared.  There's nothing to stop you relisting it each time you think of it - if you are passing through your lists then the task will keep popping up :-)<br><br>Good luck!</div>

<div class="content">My life has become a nightmare. I have started so many projects with AF that I have stuff all over the house and on my desk "started". Total madness. I am leaving on a trip to L.A. in two days and have to pack and the dog got sick and had to go to the Emergency Vet this morning and I am so unorganized---I put way too much into my system, which was sort of okay, until I hit deadline stuff.<br><br>Yes, I have accomplished all sorts of things that have been bugging me for years..such as getting those ipod speakers to work..but the real nuts and bolts of my life are falling through the cracks.

<div class="content">Trish, sometimes I feel the same. But I think part of the problem is the backlog we have stuffed into the system. I think it's wise to follow Mark's advice to start AF without backlog and than to take over backlog items step by step (that's what I'm doing with the second part of my old "master tasklist"). Once the backlog is cleared we either don't have the problem anymore or we are overcommited.</div>

<div class="content">Absolutely agree with Christian, Trish.  And I think the excitement and freedom generated does add to a bit of a mess effect when you first start - it's a bit like when we were children doing lots of things at once!  I found the same thing initially but then found it caused me to look at the systems I needed to put into place tp manage those mini-projects, like buying a few new filing trays.  Strangely my "excess AF generated partial project mess" hadn't bothered me until today - and why? Because I am packing to go away for the weekend.  I think it's just a trip thing - a throw back to the "everything must be 100% perfect when you leave the house to go away".  Well I hardly think the "neat police" will come a-calling over the weekend so I guess it'll be quite happy on my list 'til next week! <br><br>Enjoy L.A.</div>

<div class="content">Thank you Christine for loving my art!!<br><br>Your comments are helpful ... it will be difficult but I will cross off neck stretches and put them at the end.  I am not even beginning to get through all the pages in one day ... it has taken me 4 1/2 days to get back to page 1.  <br><br>Those 2 posts look helpful and I am checking them out - when I get back again to this on my list.  My email isn't working with this system ... I had started to get a habit where I checked the email and knocked off what I could often and it was really helping to keep up with the volume ... but things are a total mess again with lots of important business stuff now lost in the fluff.  Clearly for me I need to keep the fluff moving along and then be able to dig in with what really needs my attention at intervals (at least that is my current analysis).<br><br>One success, there is an artist that I have wanted to feature on my blog for over a year - but I never took the time to do it.  It took me probably 5 hours altogether because of finding of the images and all.  But yesterday after I broke it down over a couple of days, I just forced myself to finish it - because any more steps would have meant I took much longer than if I just finished it up.  I was totally totally overwhelmed by the resistance but kept going through it ... because I know I CAN do that when it is TIME TO!!<br><br>But I am delighted it is off the list!  And so very glad I did do it.  Maybe my things are too big - I don't know.

<div class="content">I can follow all the thoughts why GTD not really worked. But for me two other aspects are also very important why AF seems to suit me better than other time management methods: <br><br>AF gave me method to put everything into a medium which I can take with me whereever I go. That gives me the possibility to read through my lists in waiting time, when commuting, etc. Totally different from having everything in a computer system (and by the way, MLO, which I used, is really a good one). Maybe with a PDA you get a similar feeling. By reading and maintaining the lists several times a day I know the important tasks on the lists, and thus important tasks get done when they should be done, even if they are not on the page which I'm just working on. I believe that by looking very often at the list, the sub concious part of my brain knows much better what is to do and directs me accordingly.<br><br>And a second aspect seems to be important for me, even if I'm not yet perfect enough in it: it is the little and often approach. I started AF with my normal way of working: If you start a task, then you work until it is finished. Result: It took me three days to go through my pages. Often this was necessary because of deadline driven work. But I hope that with the little and often principle this deadline driven work approach will vanish, and I made already some encouraging experiences towards that goal.  <br><br>Wolfgang</div>

<div class="content">I also think the little-and-often approach can be very useful, esp. when we need to overcome internal resistance. But I think one should avoid to overdo it. When you can finish a task in a sensible amount of time you should do it. Every restart of a task needs some time to get into the topic again (depending on the complexity of the task). Thus instead of 30 min in one go one  might need 3 times 12 min = 36 min.</div>

<div class="content">Christian:<br><br>I would certainly agree with you that if you can finish a task in a sensible amount of time then you should do it. Bear in mind that "little" in the phrase "little and often" is a relative term. For a big project the sessions may be several hours long.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Diane<br><br>I think it can take a bit of time when starting AF to get the right balance.  We all have different types of tasks on our lists whcih favour different approaches.  Some tasks are small, requiring only a few minutes, some require more intense effort.  Whilst projects can be broken down and progressed using the "little and often" approach, there are things that do need lengthy time bursts.<br><br>If I have a day with only a small amount of discretionary time I may only work on one page.  That is to a degree frustrating when I want to progress more, but I have to work with what I have, and at present my "frantic Fridays" in particular give me only a small amount of time, and that is in small blocks.  The great thing for me about AF is that I am happy to use it outside of "normal work hours" which means that I can still make a little more progress than would have been possible, particularly since I have home type items on my list as well, and also leisure items.<br><br>It's great that you've got one major thing cleared from your list - those successes really mean something don't they?  A suggestion for the items you feel you're getting behind on, such as email, is to put them on each page.  I have check email on every page at least once, sometimes more.  I have built up more of a backlog than I had at the beginning of AF but am actively culling some of my subscription mail and have changed my email setup which is facilitating things.  I would not have done this if I hadn't taken time out to review the system.  I also action any urgent email as part of my check email task, so even though I have a backlog it is not urgent.<br><br>It is also helpful if you have not gone through all of your lists on a given day, to read through the lists to ensure you have not missed any urgent tasks, and if necessary use a same day approach to those items.  There is a little more info at the following post<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/638674" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/638674</a><br><br>Hope that helps</div>

<div class="content">Thanks again Christine for your thoughts ...  I am beginning to think I need to change this system a little to make it work for me.  Many, many of my tasks are recurrent ... post new images at CafePress, at Etsy, write a post for the blog, check email ... and on and on ..<br><br>What has seemed to have happen is I am having terrible resistance to AF.  I get shut down when I look at it ... it has a lot (well like 7) pages ... and I just can't stand it.<br><br>I am wondering if maybe I should tailor it for me.  As I had mentioned before, I used to have a great system where I just cranked it all out in joy.  Then it broke down when I got sick and there became too many backs of envelopes to keep track of.  But I used to just glance through and see what jumped off the page and then go do it for awhile and then go back and look again ... like AF.<br><br>But I am thinking that I should do the book by listing all the recurring things in the notebook .. and NOT cross them off.  Then I can skim through them and not feel sick with trying to find the ones I need ... and then will I find something on this page ... when I know what would make me really happy to do is 5 pages ahead ...<br><br>You said that you put email on every page ... but then if it gets crossed off each page ... then what ... it takes too long to get there again.  I seem to do better (not great yet) with email when I hit it often and little ... deal with a few, file a few and come back to deal with more later ... and I know I need to make it more manageable too.<br><br>I feel happy when I think of putting all the usuals in the notebook - IN ONE PLACE!! - and then put the other stuff after it ... some of those will get crossed off ... but many of those are recurrent too ... deal with client X's job ... well ... then deal with it again.<br><br>But then I feel that is not how it is supposed to be done ... but I am getting real overwhelmed this way!

<div class="content">Hi Diane<br><br>It sounds from what you're saying as if you may not be "doing" AF correctly.  I currently have 23 active pages, and although I have had some concerns due to having virtually no discretionary time this past week, I am not experiencing the "mindless panic" feelings of overwhelm I had previously.<br><br>Let's look at the specifics:<br><br>You mention that you have 7 pages open.  Are you treating each page as a "closed" list and actioning it exactly as stated in the instructions?  i.e. by doing the first task that "stands out", then the next on the same page, and so on until no further items stand out.  By stand out I mean an item that you feel like doing (i.e. it just feels like the right time to do it) as opposed to "I really ought to do this item".<br><br>Are you remembering that you only have to do a small amount on any given item?  That may only be the time it takes to reprase it or to redefine it as a list of smaller sub-tasks.  Incidentally that counts as action - you cross the task off and either re-enter it at the end or re-enter it as the newly defined sub-tasks. <br><br>Also you only "have" to do one item per page - you do not have to action the same page until everything is done .......<br><br>Are you crossing off items when you do anything, even just a little bit, on them?  That is a big part of the process - it keeps the lists moving and the crossed off items become motivators in themselves.<br><br>You say you're trying to find the items you need - it does sound as though there is a degree of trying to rationally choose items.  With reference to your comment about email it should not take you long to get back to it - if you are moving through your lists.  <br><br>For example, if I am on page 9 (of my 23 pages) I actually have check email 3 times on that page, but they are all crossed through as completed.  On that page, which started with 34 tasks, I have 18 tasks still open.  I only have to do 1 of those tasks, but may do more, before moving on to page 10.  On page 10, and purely coincidentally, check email is also included 3 times.  Two are crossed through and one is outstanding, so I only have to move to the next page before I can check email again!  The reason check email is appearing more than once is that, each time I check email I cross it through and re-enter it.  If I am on my "last" page, i.e. the page I am adding new items to, then it gets re-entered on the same page.  As I am unlikely to want to stop to check my email so soon, I end up with a smattering of active "check email" items throughout my active pages.<br><br>There is nothing to stop you from keeping a separate list of routine tasks to hand to add a comfort factor that you are not missing anything - as referenced in the urgent/same day item suggestions - but I would recommend retaining and actioning them within AF and just keeping that list alongside your AF lists until you are comfortable that you are not missing anything.<br><br>I suspect you may be treating your 7 pages as one long to do list (which would be enough to make anyone panic!) rather than as 7 closed lists but hopefully some of the above may help to give you a few pointers. <br><br>Have a re-read of the instructions - the crossing off and re-entering of items is an important part of the process, as is doing the items that stand out (as feeling right) as opposed to those that you just believe are urgent.  Obviously if something needs to be done urgently then you just do it, but it is learning to go with what intuitively feels rights as opposed to what we think we ought to be doing that is the real key.<br> <br>Good luck Diane - hope that helps somewhat - do keep us posted......</div>

<div class="content">Thank you for answering Christine ... yes - I had been choosing an item that stands out ... that is not my problem.  That part is easy for me ... it is more that there are things that I do need to do.  I can keep myself busy for sure ... but there are things that need to be done in a reasonable time ... and they are falling behind.  <br><br>I get so tired at looking through things that are over half-crossed off ... it is like all this pressure ... and not much pleasure .. I don't know if that makes sense to you.<br><br>When you say each list is closed ... I assume you mean that it is a finite 1 page list instead of an open list for the whole book.  I don't know, the joy isn't there seeing that list.  It is overwhelming ... I would think though ... having a list of a couple of pages of the recurring things would be a lot more fun .. then I get to see what pops out better.<br><br>I don't know.  Thanks! ~ Diane</div>

<div class="content">Hi Diane<br><br>The concept of the closed list is that each page is a separate list in it's own right - consequently you have 7 lists as opposed to one long list.  It is a problem when we have a large overwhelming backlog and you find the solution is just to block off a day or two to clear that, both mentally and physically, and come back to AF afresh.  I had to spend some pretty intensive time on a couple of things this week but just kept reviewing my lists in the meantime to make sure nothing slipped through the gaps.  That seems to have gotten me back on track, and the fact that I am clearing historic backlogs gives me hope for the future.<br><br>Do make sure you add some fun things onto your lists as well - although I would imagine painting is pretty fun.....:-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Diane<br><br>It does sound as if the problem has something to do with how you are viewing items as standing out - when you say "I don't necessarily feel like exercising where it is on the list" then it sounds as if you are saying that you believe that you should be feeling like exercising at that point.  If you do not feel like exercising when you see that on your list then it is not standing out and you should not do it.  When it is the right time you will actually feel like doing it.<br><br>You also said "I had been choosing an item that stands out ... that is not my problem. That part is easy for me ... it is more that there are things that I do need to do."  If, as you say, you are recognising the standing out item as the item you feel like doing, then it sounds as though you are somehow feeling that there are other things you "ought" to be doing more and it is maybe that that is giving you the stress ..........?<br><br>Mark talks about "trusting the system" by which he means learning to trust that the thing you "feel" like doing IS the right thing to do rather than the thing you believe you "ought" to be doing.  It IS hard to explain ..... you know when you are painting and you just lose yourself in the picture you are painting?  When your creativity is flowing without worrying about anything else ....... it is that sort of feeling.  One thing strikes me though, you said "it is more about making a living as an artist has dozens of pieces to do on a regular basis ... I also have graphic design and web design clients ... marketing art is endless ... " is it that all of the stuff around your art - the business side of it - is it that which is causing the stress, possibly because you feel it detracts in some way from your creativity?  One of the things that people have been finding with AF is that it does actually help us to realise what is really important to us and can bring to the surface areas where we would like to make changes.  If we do not feel it is possible to make those changes that can be a stress in itself ........<br><br>Hope that makes some sort of sense ..... :-)<br><br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Christine<br><br>You have raised a completely new idea for me when you say the you have a "smattering" of live "do emails" on your list the oldest of which is as far back as page 10 (of 23 pages).  <br><br>I would be reluctant to do this since one of my intentions in time management would be to limit the number of times I actually visit an item like "do emails".  Now even if I were to follow your lead, I would be reluctant to formally give myself permission to check emails 5 or 6 times a day.  But I am imagining that you might have "do emails" on you list as live items dozen of times.<br><br>So I am asking myself the question: "Are there any things that are so important to me and that I want to do so regularly that I ought to enter exactly the same item on my list a number of times without crossing them off so that despite my crossing off and re-entering they will always appear on my list a number of times as live items.    <br><br>One of the reasons participants give for being reluctant to trust AF is that they are frightened to wait till they get back to the end of the list before they have an opportunity to tackle this item again.  <br><br>Perhaps your strategy of entering recurrent items more than once so that they come around more often would reassure the fearful, but I cannot resist the feeling that it is "cheating" the system and that it is better not do do it without very strong reasons.</div>

If you are cycllng through your pages quickly enough then you would generally be scanning all of the items at some point each day ........... ?  <br><br>If exercise and other tasks are tasks that you need to do daily, then have you tried the index card approach, having them on a separate list which you work with your AF pages, so that you can chose from either list?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jim<br><br>I think there may be a slight misunderstanding here - I am not advocating bucking the system - my multiple email entries have grown within the system. Let me try to explain.  I do put chaeck emails as an item on each page as a matter of course as that is something I need to do regularly.  That keeps it mind and I do it when it stands out.  When I do I cross it out and reenter it at the end of the list.  As it is a recurring item the more I do it the more times it will appear on my list somewhere.  It is not that I am adding to the list several times "to give myself permission" to do it, rather that I "have permission to do it" *because* it is on the list several times.  The number of entries will vary....<br><br>Email is an area I am addressing so that the number of tasks relating to that will at this point in time be a lot more than I anticipate in the future.  AF has prompted me to look at my email system, setting up automatic rules and categorisations, and improving my spamfilter.  In a way, at this present time, email is more of a project than just a routine.<br><br>Does that make more sense?  I suspect many of us will have items such as this where we need to address the underlying issue rather than just the task - by using the framework of AF I believe that makes it easier to do so.  Email just happens to be one of my "problems" at this point in time so needs more frequent checking than I wish long term.<br><br>When you say "I would be reluctant to do this since one of my intentions in time management would be to limit the number of times I actually visit an item like "do emails". " that is actually approaching the issue logically.  Yes that is one of my goals too but the important thing is that I am checking my email "at the right time" and "as often as necessary" which AF is getting me to.  If I have a backlog (of anything) then to clear it will require more time than when it is up to date.  Therefore the actual task is not "reduce time...." but "clear backlog" - the rest will follow.<br><br>You also said "So I am asking myself the question: "Are there any things that are so important to me and that I want to do so regularly that I ought to enter exactly the same item on my list a number of times without crossing them off so that despite my crossing off and re-entering they will always appear on my list a number of times as live items."  I think that is an important question.  (I assume you are saying entering a deliberate duplicate even though you haven't crossed off the previous listing of it, rather than not crossing it off when done).  I believe that yes it is ok to duplicate an item - it certainly happens accidentally for me!  For me, the important thing is to enter a task when I think of it.  If it is already on the list that is no problem - but I am at least sure (doubly!) that it is on the list.<br><br>Sorry Jim, a bit of a long-winded explanation but I think this is an important point ....... <br></div>

<div class="content">Yes - I was using my own version of AF that I developed decades ago - and that system was great for me ... ~ Diane</div>

<div class="content">Hi Diane<br><br>It does sound as if you are overwhelmed with it all and that is not a fun place to be!  I know what that is like and it is hard to regain focus.  I consider myself very fortunate to have "got AF" so quickly as I was quite desperate myself to find a solution.<br><br>The first thing is that you need to get yourself back on an even keel - while you are panicking about "the system" it is hard to think about anything else.  If you have a system that is or has worked for you previously, that you feel you are able to work with at present, my suggestion would be to use that to get yourself to a stage where you "feel" more in control and then to relook at your AF approach. Perhaps you could set aside a little time each day just to think through how you are using the system to start with. <br><br>It is obviously difficult without knowing specifically where the problem is but it does sound as though you may possibly have been trying to work AF as if it were your old system.  Can you identify what similarities and what differences there are between the two systems?  That might be a good starting point.  My obvious recommendation would still be to try starting the AF system from scratch, exactly as written with no preconceptions, but it sounds as if you need to find a short term "comfort factor" solution first. <br><br>Good luck Diane ... keep us posted<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine ... thank you for your ongoing support.  For a couple of days after you wrote, I had great days ... most of the day I just did what I wanted and got lots done on big projects that needed doing.  When I started to feel like I was not sure what to do, I went to AF and that was fine.<br><br>This past week has been a family crisis that has pretty much eaten up the whole week and will still take a lot for a bit ... sigh ... but I am at least trying to maintain what I NEED to do for my business and I keep AF notebook next to me .... for when and if there is space.<br><br>I am not sure how all this will shake out around AF but I appreciate all the help you have been in helping me get going!  Thank you! ~ Diane <br><br>ps free giveaway <a href="http://www.dianeclancy.com/blog/2009/01/one-world-one-heart-giveaway/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dianeclancy.com/blog/2009/01/one-world-one-heart-giveaway/</a><br><br>pps yesterday I was featured on the front page of the weekly newspaper - you can see it online <a href="http://www.reformer.com/greenfield/ci_11632055" rel="nofollow">http://www.reformer.com/greenfield/ci_11632055</a>  Thanks!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Diane<br><br>Sorry you've had such a tough week - those times can be really hard - just hang on in there.  It's good that you had the chance to get AF working well for you and you will find that, even if you don't get to work on your lists regularly for a while, just reviewing them when you have a moment will help keep you going and you will more than likely find when you get back to them that you have actually completed a lot more than you realise. Life can't always be divided into nice neat packages of discretionary time so we have to run with what we have at any given moment.  <br><br>Hope things improve for you and congratulations on the newspaper article - sounds great!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine ... Thanks for all your kindness that you have been sending my way!<br><br>I think I figured out what wasn't working for me and how it is best for me to work with AF.  Often when I get up, I am psyched about a certain project that I need to work on ... so I have been allowing myself to work on what I want to ... what really juices me ... for as long as it does.  I know AF is often and little ... but often my projects go from one to another to another since so many things are linked.  It seems fine to me as long as I am feeling joyful to be doing what I am doing.<br><br>But once I start to catch that the thing isn't really feeling so superb to be working on... then I need to switch gears.  Once no project is joyfully yelling at me, then I turn to AF ... then it feels great.<br><br>It was my old problem of allowing helpful things to be in charge instead of remembering that I am in charge and they are there to help me - not own me.  (old issues and all)<br><br>Also it seems important to allow myself to work where my energy really is ... instead of starting where I left off.  And it is wonderful to have this one notebook with it all in it.  Even though this family crisis, at least I know I am writing down things where I can find them.<br><br>The other night before I went to bed, I caught myself jotting down notes on an old envelope .. and went whoops!! That is asking for trouble .. so instead I put the things to do in my notebook.<br><br>Given the family crisis going on, much has NEEDED to be done ... but as I start to have more free time again, then I will be able to go back to more of the optional items that build my business.  And these last 2 weeks I have been interviewed by the newspaper twice and they are quite good!<br><br>So thank you again for your support!  I do think I have figured out how to use this AF ... I would like to post again to you if I run into more problems.  Thank you!! ~ Diane Clancy</div>

<div class="content">Hi Diane<br><br>I'm glad you are finding AF is starting to work better for you, and am pleased if I have been able to help in any way.  Don't worry about spending "as long as you feel like" on projects.  Although AF uses the little and often approach some things need longer time blocks, and particularly when you are going through a tough time I think it is often our mind's way of enabling us to switch off and recharge our own batteries for a while.  By putting everything down into your lists you know that you have everything in one place - and that in itself is a big thing - no more scrabbling for those elusive envelopes:-)<br><br>I find that things get done "off list" simply because it is the right time to do them, or as you put it that is where the energy is.  If I feel a burning desire to clean the oven (strange thought!), unless I have a scheduled appointment I will do it, even if that task is on a different page.  When I get to the page it'll just get crossed off then.  You may already be doing this but do write down on the list all of the things you "need" to do during the family crisis.  Not only will it ensure you don't forget things, but it will also enable you to see how the system works even in a crisis.<br><br>Hope things start to settle down - and keep well!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine ... thanks for the clarification!!<br><br>That is exactly where I was getting stuck before - spending long time on projects when I wanted to and following my bliss (cleaning the oven if I felt like it) on "off list" items .. (that were really on a different page).  Also as an artist I often need to work in large blocks of time.<br><br>I was feeling like I HAD to do things in the AF order even when I was quite excited about other things ... that was what had it not working for me .. so I was pushing aside what I was excited about to go do AF.  I LOVE the AF as the place to turn once I am not sure what to do.<br><br>That is essentially what I used to do ... but spread over waaaay waaaay too many backs of envelopes.  So AF tweaks for me what was working well until my system broke down.  And having things all in one place with the going through page by page when I don't know what to do is great!!<br><br>Thanks again!! ~ Diane<br><br></div>
