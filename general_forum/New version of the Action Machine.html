<div class="content">Hi Mark and All,<br><br>I just wanted to inform everyone that a new version of the Action Machine has been released.  Here is what is new:<br><br>* Custom time settings for timers (choose between 1 minute and<br>  7 hours 59 minutes<br><br>* Balloon notifications (for those times when you have your volume<br>  turned down and you can't hear the alarm)<br><br>* Estimated time of completion information<br><br>* New timer creation shortcuts<br><br>I own this software package and am finding it very useful for time boxing certain tasks.  It works well with AF.<br><br>Best wishes,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Hi David,<br><br>Thanks for this, I wanted to thank you and others earlier about this application, it IS useful and I've found the time boxing concept useful along with AF.  I downloaded and purchased TAM after researching on the AF forum.<br><br>For some reason, the overhead with TAM is not like some of those other "systems" many of us have tried and failed to make work to solve our own problems.<br><br>Tweaks and pragmatism rule!</div>

<div class="content">Mel:<br><br>If you purchased The Action Machine, Derek asked you the supply an email address to which he can send update links. If you did not do so, you don't receive them.<br><br>I could post the link here, but Derek uses no kind of copy protection, so that would mean everyone could download the application without paying.<br><br>If you have purchased it, you can try to mail Derek at derekonline [at] gmail (dot) com, he'll probably send the link to you.</div>

<div class="content">First I thought "why is he hiding an already short url with budurl?", but then I saw the affiliate id. Sneaky, Jon. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">The non-affiliate url is <a href="http://www.theactionmachine.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.theactionmachine.com/</a></div>

<div class="content">@Andreas - it was not meant to be sneaky! I mentioned about The Action Machine's great affiliate policy in another thread. budurl is just a handy way to track where the clicks come from. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Well, you can claim it wasn't sneaky but I don't think that's how many of us see it. The "great affiliate policy" only benefits you...it means you get 60% of the sale price if someone buys through your disguised affiliate link. <br><br>Many of us have Clickbank accounts (I have a few), and we could all play these sorts of internet marketing games but I think it is disrespectful to forum participants to be secretly making money from them...it upsets the open nature of the discussions when someone has a hidden agenda for promoting a product.<br><br>Unless you are donating the money you're making to Mark Forster (which is not a bad idea), I don't see what value the "great affiliate policy" has for anyone apart from you.<br><br>Just my two cents (at the equivalent Pound-Sterling exchange rate).</div>

<div class="content">Hi Frank, good to hear your point of view.<br><br>This is the first time I've ever even created an affiliate link and it was all a new experiment for me. Sorry if my link was unwelcome. I didn't think it would hurt anyone. I also thought that budurl was fairly well known for being used by affiliates. My mistake perhaps.<br><br>I do not intend to donate directly to Mark Forster unless he starts asking for donations. Otherwise I will wait for his next product and buy that. I have two of his books already.<br><br>But if it makes you feel any better I do try to donate to charity regularly. I recently gave a £200 donation to Comic Relief, for example.<br><br>Regards,<br>Jon<br></div>

<div class="content">Personally, I don't have a problem with affiliate links, but I prefer it if the poster is open about it. For example writing "(affiliate link)" behind the url would be perfect. Or not cloaking the url. So far, I didn't associate budurl or any other cloaking service with affiliate links, at least not with honest ones. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jon,<br><br>Like Andreas, I don't particularly have any problem with affiliate links - I do quite a bit of internet marketing on the side using them so I am certainly not complaining about them. It would just be better if it was done more openly so folks can take into account that there might be a "vested interest" involved in a certain posting.</div>

<div class="content">Funnily enough I announced this new version of the Action Machine, complete with link to the site, two days before David did, and no one commented at all!<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/727069#post772603" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/727069#post772603</a></div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br>That's probably because David created a new topic, while you answered to an existing topic. The latter made sense, because the Action Machine is related to that topic, but I for example wasn't following that topic anymore, but I saw the newly created topic.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>I am sorry -- I did not see your post.  Like Andreas, I do not follow every thread.  My apologies...I did not mean to ignore you...<br><br>Best wishes,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Hi all<br><br>I realise that not everyone follows every post but when Jon posted about The Action Machine in an earlier thread<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/727069#post735309" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/727069#post735309</a><br><br>he clearly stated his link was an affiliate link and the percentage he would make.  Perhaps if anyone uses affiliate links it would be helpful to add that info at the time, as Jon did in his original post above.</div>

<div class="content">Do we know where this program actually comes from?  I see some from Derek Franklin, some from Dennes Becker or Derek and Dennis, and some from Dan Brown.  Although, except for the price ($27, $27, $47) and free updates (yes, no, yes), the sites all look the same.  Does the author/writer only sell his program wholesale to online marketing guys?  I have tried the free online version but if I am to use it serioulsy, I think I need to invest in it.</div>
