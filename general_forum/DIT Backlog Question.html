<div class="content">I started a new DIT list today and declared a backlog of items. When working through the backlog of tasks (which is my current initiative), what is the right way to remove a task from the backlog?<br><br>If I work on it some but don't complete it, do I mark it off the backlog list and move it back to the DIT list for the next day? Or does it stay on the backlog list until it is completed?<br><br>Thanks!</div>

<div class="content">When I was doing DIT, I would move such an item to the DIT list for the next day -- since the item is now an item I am actively working.</div>

<div class="content">OK, rereading I see it was just Mark. But that's the definite answer anyhow, right? :)</div>
