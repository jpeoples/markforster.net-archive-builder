<div class="content">AF is wonderful. I just follow the rules and get into a flow, and things get easy. Projects move forward, ideas emerge, things get done. I know where to write anything down - at the end of the list -, and I know where to look for the next action - on my current active page -, and work is wonderful.<br><br>But as soon as something becomes URGENT, I start falling out of the rhythm.<br><br>An example:<br>I have to call somebody, not now, but tomorrow or friday. I write it on the last page, which is page 23. But my current active page is page 9, and the chance to get through all active pages the next two days is almost zero.<br><br>This throws me out of the flow. Why? Because it's NOT ENOUGH to write this task down and get on with what I am doing; I MUST REALIZE that this task is time-sensitive and that I have to do something about it to make sure I won't miss to do it in time.<br><br>I can write it in my calendar instead, although it's not a fixed date. Okay. I can use the index card method and write it there (although I don't like this index card thing anymore; it feels like a q&d fix, not like something that belongs to a system), okay.<br><br>But what bothers me is THAT I HAVE TO THINK OF IT. When I jot something down at the end of the list, I am obliged to CHECK IT whether it is time-sensitive and if so, make preparations against it accordingly. This is one step too many and throws me out of the flow. In geekish: I have to unload my current (mental) process, load another and produce ideas how to avoid missing some obligatiion, then finishing this process and load again the process before. The opposite of "flow", isn't it?<br><br>IMHO a system should consist of routines that won't let the necessity for such "reparations" and "improvisations" come up.<br><br>My best "additional rule" up to now was to make the forementioned "check-if-time-sensitive" NOT when writing a task down, but in the moment I CLOSE a list. This is a step that's part of the system - you draw a line at the bottom of the page, you start a new, write "to do 24" on top or whatever - and therefore a good opportunity to go through all items to see whether some of them need additional treatment. And to draw some additional symbols to manifest that. (I have to admit I did not follow my own rule. Because I wanted to experience what would happen otherwise.)<br><br>I can hear already the mantra "Trust the system!" <br>Well, trust can not be demanded, it must be earned. I am on page 9, and I realized that there is an entry on page 23 that needs to be done within the next two days. Which means I have to do it out of order. Commonsense-rule, I know. It's not that jump that bothers me but that it REMINDS ME of the possibility that there may be OTHER urgent tasks (or tasks that HAVE become urgent meanwhile) somewhere on the pages 10-22. It bothers me because I see once again that the AF system IS NOT DESIGNED TO PREVENT those tasks from being entered and left alone.<br><br>Yes, it's true that AF encourages to start projects early enough so that their deadlines will most probably be met long before. But even then may it happen that something becomes urgent. And I am not sure I will know it every time.<br><br>I would like to see Mark Forster come up with a ingenious solution to that.</div>

<div class="content">It is interesting that you mention this as I have been thinking about exactly the same issues and trying to find a work around!<br><br>My current workaround when things get crazy or urgent things pile up is to cull a mini-list from the AF list and work from that list but using AF rules for a day or two. I get back to  the "real" AF list once the craziness passes. The mini-list might be project based (a project has just become critical), urgency based (a list of time sensitive tasks) or "context" based (I am traveling and don't have access to usual resources). This list may be a page or 2. The workflow has all the elements of Autofocus. I can pick the item that stands out but only from this mini-list. I add to the end of the list if progress is made but not completed. I expect all the items to be completed from this list before I get back to the main list. When I do get back to the main list, I just mark all the items (moved to mini-list) completed.<br><br>This has been working well but still feels like a work-around and as you mention doesn't have the same flow as the pure AF. I still have to work at it to branch off to the mini-list (although there is enough motivation due to external circumstances to create one). Someone mentioned in another thread that they use the last page to create this mini-list and work the last page exclusively. I haven't tried that yet although that may be closer to Pure AF than what I have.<br><br>GC</div>

<div class="content">To Andrea. I had the same problem my solution is is something is so important that you must do it one day put it on your calendar. I alway have 5/10 tasks on it chich are not appointement and cross it from AF list. <br><br>To Greenchutney. Right ith you too when craztness hapen i jus do a minilist of task and treat them one after the other like independant items. exceptionaly when things needs i put it on my calendar like P9 / General topic sub items....<br><br>With these i never think about urgent tasks i just do them</div>

<div class="content">Isn't this what AF is supposed to highlight?  That when you get to that point that you cannot cycle through the pages on a timely basis (ie. for me, at least once a day) - it's time to rethink your commitments, clear your backlog by action or dismissal, and get to a level of active pages that will handle urgent items / periods in its stride?  The system not working properly is telling you exactly what you have to do, isn't it?  <br><br>When I read Mark's post that he cycles through his pages at least once a day, if not more, I knew that was the point I wanted to reach - the optimum use of the system.<br><br>When I didn't listen to it right away, *I* was letting the system down, the system was not letting me down.  It was doing exactly what it should - telling me that *it* - and I - were overloaded.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Greenchutney:<br>The "mini-list" is an idea I like - more than the "index card". Maybe because it feels more related to the overall AF principle than an index card, which feels more like borrowed from Time Systems...<br><br>I have tried something similar before a voyage last week; I drew a thick line across the last entry on the last page, wrote "Travel Preparations" and then jotted down everything I had to  accomplish before.<br><br>The methodical difficulty: I didn't know where to write down additional tasks - because in such a situation, two kinds of new tasks may come up: ideas for something I maybe will do someday, and tasks related to the urgent tasks I've collected.<br><br>So, next time I'll try a "mini-AF" on separate pages!<br><br>Jacqueline:<br>I am surely *not* overloaded, to begin with... :-)<br><br>For me, the whole point of AF is that it's clearing out what's not important and should be dropped BY ITSELF, that is, by using it according to the rules. To go through the lists and to strike out tasks I "think" are superfluous is, in my opinion, the opposite of "let the subconscious do the prioritizing".<br><br>It would be nice to be able to cycle through the list once a day, but that depends on the nature of the tasks. Some tasks cannot be chunked arbitrarily. For example, to "go on a walk" will take an hour, otherwise it's not a walk, but just looking out of the door. And the point of "start it, do something and do it as long as you feel like" is to get me into motion - and that works very well, I welcome this effect that very often I feel like continuing something I started with the idea of "I just do 5 minutes" and so I get things going.<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">For example, to "go on a walk" will take an hour, otherwise it's not a walk, but just looking out of the door. LOL And of course the "for as long as I feel like it" without breaking the AF rules could require a "beam me up Scotty" approach if after half an hour you want to do something else ....... :-)<br><br>Whilst I would love to be able to cycle through my lists daily the fact that I can't do so really does not bother me.  It did - but I realised that that in itself was not trusting the system.  There is a reason for the volume of stuff I have - the system is sifting it - and like you I do not want to be the one to "choose" what to delete or restrict what I add, because that is not what AF is about.  Sometimes working with AF is uncomfortable - because it IS working as it is supposed to.  Sometimes things don't get done - because it IS working as it is supposed to. The important thing is to understand why it works and how it works.  Only then can we know whether what we are doing is actually breaking the rules or not.  <br><br>Suppose I am out shopping (therefore have no discretionery time to work on my lists).  I know I am working on page 6.  I know that on page 8 I have a task to "call Fred".  In the supermarket I meet Fred's brother.  I tell Fred's brother "I have been meaning to give Fred a call"  Fred kindly hands me his phone.  So of course I say, "oh no, I couldn't possibly..... you see I want to call Fred, and I do have it on my list but it is two pages away, and, well, even then it may not stand out, so I am really sorry but I must decline your kind offer - just in case my intuition doesn't believe it is the right time .... you do understand don't you ?....." :-)<br><br>In many ways, the fact that I do have so many pages and items is keeping me more focused on what is important and enabling me to see what needs to be actioned and what can be left.  The fact that some things cannot be dismissed makes those hard decisions easier, not in that it encourages a "breaking of the rules" but in that it provides the catalyst for action.  I guess the one rule that does get broken consistently in a crisis scenario is that of "for as long as you feel" but that in itself has to be common sense (unless someone really has invented that transporter pad?!)</div>

<div class="content">My apologies Andreas - I must not have understood your post.   I thought you were saying that you wouldn't know if something on your list was urgent because you didn't get through your pages often enough to catch this stuff by what you said below: <br><br>"I am on page 9, and I realized that there is an entry on page 23 that needs to be done within the next two days. Which means I have to do it out of order. Commonsense-rule, I know.

I do this first thing in the morning.<br><br>Maybe due to gender I'm just accustomed to juggling things and having the peace and time for being in a flow state (aka getting up at 5 before the kids and pets get up) comes rarely.</div>

<div class="content">Hi AnreasE,<br><br>I think I am a fairly busy fellow with a large number of deadline driven projects and tasks.  I am finding AF to work well for me, but I do the following things for things that have to be done on or by a certain time:<br><br>(1) For the phone call you mentioned -- it has to be done on Thursday or Friday -- add this to your calendar as a header or note somehow.  I do this in Outlook by creating an all-day task that spans two days -- so the banner is at the top -- and list the task as "Call Sally about project X?"  The question mark means it does not HAVE to be done at a certain time of even the first day, but by the end of the second day.  I keep these kinds of things separate from the AF list.  <br><br>(2) I use Outlook 2007 for task management of things that have hard deadlines.  They are right there and listed also below each day on the calendar.  I do also add these into my AF lists and make notation as follows: "Complete review of task force report  DUE: 4/10"  I underline the "DUE: 4/10" with a red pen.<br><br>(3) I maintain separate project lists and plans in OneNote 2007.  If there are tasks that I am ready to move on, I put these into AF.  It is stricly a judgement call to leave them on the planning list versus putting them into my AF lists.<br><br>(4) I also create time blocks for certain important projects -- sometimes up to 2 hours of time -- and I protect that time ruthlessly -- and work ONLY on items associated with that particular project.<br><br>(5) When not doing the above -- I work off of my AF lists!  I try to do this as much as possible.<br><br>This combination is working well for me.<br><br>I hope this helps some.<br><br>Best regards,<br>-David<br></div>

<div class="content">Definitely sounds good David - I like how you use Outlook.  I used to use it extensively but got so irritated with it after the 2003 release that I switched to alternative options.  The really strange thing is that my existing schedule (in OneNote) is really basic but when I tried to convert it to Outlook I had to dismiss the task as for some reason, like paper notebooks, my basic schedule is right for me.</div>

<div class="content">This is one reason I love a digital AF list. I add deadlines to any tasks that have them. These tasks are listed at the top of each page, but if I am anxious, I can see any tasks that have deadlines by looking at All Tasks. They are grouped by deadline (Overdue/Today & Tomorrow/This Week/Future. I also have my iPhone badge number set to tasks due in the next two days. Often what I find, however, is that when the anxiety sets in, there really aren't many time-sensitive tasks to be concerned with. The more often you work your list, the less often you will have that time-urgency panic imo.</div>

<div class="content">Re: the mini-list, Greenchutney (and others that have mentioned this) this is a wonderful idea!  Preparing to host Easter dinner for my family, I took this idea and created a list of the things I need to do JUST for this "project", ignoring my main list for now. <br><br>I did take time to review my main list for related tasks, dismissing them from the main list and adding them to my new mini-list.  When the event has passed, I plan on reviewing the mini-list and adding back any tasks that didn't get completed that I still want to do.  Stuff like "make living room look like it jumped out of the pages of Home Beautiful", which will NOT happen, and I know this, but hey, a gal can dream...  (Ok, that task is not REALLY on my list, but you get the drift!)<br><br>So thank you for this splendid idea, Greenchutney!</div>

If so, write it down somewhere else, it does not belong here', the beautiful simplicity of AF disappears. Then why not write everything in a calendar-based system? All you need is a calendar that does not only show dates, but has additional space for the week as a whole: What is not done at the end of the week gets carried over to the next, or dismissed, and voilà: I'm back in the old school of time management. Which works. But creates no flow, but opposition.</div>

<div class="content">I use the same digital approach as Mel. It means I can put everything I want into AF, but still scan for urgent tasks whenever I feel the need, and the extra time taken is minimal. I don't however have time sensitive tasks listed at the top of the page - they just appear in order of entry - I feel that would skew the normal working of standing out.</div>

<div class="content">I used to draw two triangles (so that they looked like an hourglass) next to anything time sensitive and I colored in the triangles with my pen so they would stand out.  Since I'm basically lazy, that morphed into one triangle colored in.  <br><br>Now when I scan my lists, anything with a triangle stands out and gets done.<br><br>Important things that are at a specific date/time go on my calendar which fits nicely into my AF notebook.  But things like "call Sally before next Wednesday" go on the last page with a triangle.<br><br>At least that's how I do it!</div>

<div class="content">I have a pretty good idea of what is in my lists from my regular cycling and reviews and generally speaking have virtually no time dependent tasks on my earlier pages.  What I do to keep potentially time dependent tasks flowing is, at the beginning of each week, I identify what I want to achieve that week.  That will of course include any time dependent tasks.  I just keep that list on my desk and work through the lists in the normal way.  I don't action tasks from that list (which I personally do in the form of a MindMap) but highlight tasks if and when they are actioned (in the normal course of AF). <br><br>If a task becomes time critical then I will "just do it" but generally the tasks get done naturally.  That MindMap takes the worry about missing items away, in that they are identified and I also know I have the "just do it" option available if necessary.  In practice the relevant tasks normally stand out quite naturally, so get actioned easily and without pressure. <br><br>I am normally working towards the end of my list most of the time so if I am unsure where an item is I just add it (or readd it) onto the last page.  I have never considered having items duplicated to be a problem.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine B<br>You stated in the post above:<br><br>" What I do to keep potentially time dependent tasks flowing is, at the beginning of each week, I identify what I want to achieve that week."<br><br>AHA!  You create a weekly map as well!  LOL!  I failed miserably at PURE autofocus that toally eshews present case logic to create such lists.  Mainly my memory issues were the cause of my failing miserably with pure AF but also I always felt more proactive and productive with a map to use to fulfill my obligations and move forward on projects and my passions and interests. The map actually helps generate and protect my freedoms and nurtures flexibility because it erases the nag or worry factor.  Both the profound and the mundane are covered. Mostly, I do this because it encourages flexibility and freedom with a mind at peace!  LOL!  Nagging of any sort is a nuisance and fractures focus and drains mental energy....anthetical to my creative processes and purely enjoying other aspects of living.  Now a days, it protects my mind when I'm suffering pain bouts.  The pain is enough to endure/master without a nag monster robbing my brain about mundane stuff!  LOL!  Again, a peaceful mind helps me to help myself through pain.<br><br>You further state:<br>"  I just keep that list on my desk and work through the lists in the normal way. I don't action tasks from that list (which I personally do in the form of a MindMap) but highlight tasks if and when they are actioned (in the normal course of AF). <br><br>If a task becomes time critical then I will "just do it" but generally the tasks get done naturally.

The only difference is that the tasks feel natural for you to do via your AF list while keeping your Weekly mindmap in your view to keep your aims and concerns fresh as a sort of AF implementation reference!  LOL!<br>For me, working off the weekly map feels natural to me like working your AF list feels natural to you.  I'm a great proponent of streamlining the obligations and mundane matters to get them done as quickly and efficiently as possible.....to clear the decks (and my mind) for the more enticing aspects of living!  LOL!<br>Jacqueline and I discussed  how the driving forces of our meta values impactis and directs our life systems (obligations and passions chosen and decided on)  She loves her AF use yet limits it somewhat by monthly aims.<br><br>The forum title was initiated by Jacqueline  > INTERESTING TM/PRODUCTIVITY ARTICLES<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/708979" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/708979</a><br><br>In fact it was her that referenced the www.productivflourishing.com website for another item.  I almost fell out of my seat when I saw their Freelancer's Weekly Worklist!<br>It looks almost identical to mine!  I used to describe mine as a hybrid between my usual ways and a weekly take on DIT.  Now I can simply call the Freelancer's Weekly worksheet if anybody asks.  Even before the internet, people were often asking me how I juggle so much work, social life and personal interests. (I learned my father's system).  The disabilities put a spammer in the works so I looked for a system that might be easier to implement with my fractured focus.  Pain is a REAL enemy of focus!  LOL!  I think it was Jacqueline and you who wrote a post helping me with AF, and a brick hit me between the eyes!  My system has served we exceptionally well for better than 50 years with tweaks added as I learned different things such as Mark's current initiative and his "what's better" to generate a more positive attitude when I'm suffering.  His backlog eradication system dug me out in 2006.  GOLDEN!!!!<br><br>Bottom line, creating our weekly maps are the same.  The only difference is that you like working your tasks from AF.  I like doing my habits and checklists to cover the "predicable mundane and obligatory matters" quickly to get them out of my brain.  Then I do a small daily list  (culled from my weekly list) to create lasar focus and keep me reminded.  The rest of the time I'm free and hanging loose!  (Even when I'm working HARD on something I'm passionate about, I feel free!)  Boredom kills!  That's why I get that stuff knocked out as fast as I can.  On a checklist it goes FAST without rediciding.  That's how I'm used to working.  That's my "natural mode" like AF is your natural mode.<br><br>See, even AF encourages a dedicated AF'er to create a weekly list as a referent!  You also use a projects list.  These things were not MENTIONED in the AF instructions.  Maybe I wouldn't have failed quite as badly, my memory weaknesses not withstanding.<br>Thanks to you and Jacqueline, I realize that I prefer a streamlined system to knock out my boring, mundane stuff to free my time and MY brain for my preferred passions and aims.<br><br>I say fast for boring and free for passionate.  You say AF for boring and passionate.<br>Both of us use a weekly list, a projects list and a calendar and reminder system.<br><br>I say tomato and you say tomato.....<br><br>We're both simply clearing the decks of the mundane so that we can get on with the great stuff!

<div class="content">Hi learning as I go<br><br>I'm sure we view things in a very similar way :-)  Where we differ is that you have a far better ability to discipline yourself to "do" the routine tasks than I do.  I think one of the biggest revelations for me was my "dishwasher moment".  (Of course those reading this post who haven't read the earlier "dishwasher" posts will be quite bemused by that comment).  Realising that my issue is not in "what" needs to be done but in the obligation of "when" has enabled me to "do" anything - provided I can choose when!<br><br>That is why my MindMap works for me - it tells me what but not when - AF lets me choose when.  Boredom kills - absolutely agree!!!  But boredom sends me straight off onto a procrastination loop - AF enables me to bypass it.  With a "must do" list it would automatically turn into a "must don't" list.  My "want to do" list happily morphs into a "done" list :-)<br><br>Strangely my weekly MindMap grew out of the index card idea.  That approach never felt natural to me - and rarely did I feel I could justify calling tasks "must do today".  I found I listed the items but just left them sitting on the desk, rather than actioning them as the recommended AF page add-on.  The weekly "want to do" list becomes a goal but with no intense feeling of obligation.<br><br>I do find I am using MindMaps more and more though.  I had friends round the other day and instead of jotting down a quick check list for lunch preparations etc I Mindmapped it and actioned it SO easily :-)  (oooh - that was one of your type of lists - we are more alike ......)<br><br>And I now can say tomato - as La Madeleine bacame one of my favourite lunch spots I had to learn how to say both tomato and basil!  (Assuming you have La Madelieine's in your area?)<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine B<br>Your post just illuminated something I hadn't realized.  Maybe I have less problems with my lists because I don't think of them as MUST DO....I chose (most of it) the items so I think of it as WANT TO DO.  Also, I do most things a bit ahead of time so that little morphs into a MUST DO TODAY.....staying current/a bit ahead gives me the wiggle room to do it unless an unexpected opportunity or unavoidable emergency occurs.  There's no MUST so I can push aside the negotiables aside to invite in the opportunities.  Otherwise, I do it because I deem it!  LOL!  Even bills and taxes....many people pay them late, barely on time, on time or early.  When I'm able to keep within the early and on time range, I'm left with little resistance except pushing through my pain.  The pay off is that my method keeps me in the sweet spot of choosing for myself.  I, too, hate MUST DOs!  LOL!  My little workaround is by staying current or ahead, they remain as WANT TOs unless pain prohibits certain types of tasks.  I can mop my floor 5 minutes at a time through hard pain yet I can't reliably crunch numbers.....boring plus exacting detail requires the most focus and determination than any other chore.  LOL!  When the pain levels allow, I pull out my trusty timer and make a competition out of it!  I won't allow scutwork to rob me of peace of mind.....kill it ASAP!  LOL!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Hi Will and Smileypete...<br><br>Here is a real life example:<br><br>I sent my CV to a friend of mine for reviewing (he's good at that). He returned it to  me with all kind of observations, and I added to my list "review CV corrections".<br><br>Before I could reach that page, I worked on a lot of less important tasks like "Organize bills", and many others. Since I can't really work with my list everyday because I work a lot (that explains the CV's priority), it took me more than a week until I reached it.<br><br>The task itself doesn't have a deadline, I still have my current job and its not really bad, so its not urgent. Anyway, the overall feeling was that I was pushing a task that was much more relevant at this point.<br><br>To be sincere, I didn't forget it and it was in my mind all the time, but I wanted to work by the rules. There are tasks that I don't remember, but are more or less as relevant as the CV, and would get priority over others if I knew beforehand that they were waiting a few pages ahead.<br><br>Somebody wrote in another thread that he's working in the way I described in my last post (reviewing everything and building a list of more important tasks).<br><br>The question is how much the methodology gets distorted by "cheating".<br>Please remember that these are not urgent tasks, simply more important right now.<br><br>Walter<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Walter.<br><br>I think this is a deliberate feature of the system. <br><br>If you always work on the most important tasks, there is a real risk that the less important ones never get done. If they are supporting important commitments, that could be a problem. If not, I'd simply move past them, dismissing if necessary and make a task to review dismissed items, which you'll get to after you do the looming important item.</div>

<div class="content">Will, you are absolutely right - it is by following the rules that we really get to grips with the fact that certain, seemingly insignificant tasks, have much more of an impact than our rational approach based on urgency may have given credit for.<br><br>Walther's is a great example - the CV is important but, in the circumstances described, not urgent.  Using this approach his mind will have had time to think more about it so that when the task is reached it will not be a rush job.  Tasks such as "organixe" bills may also not have an urgency but are certainly a task that can lead to crisis if not actioned prior to becoming so.<br><br>Our decision on urgency generally comes from our rational mind which is not always right!  Using my MindMap of items I want to do purely as a reminder, rather than any form of "must do" list has really helped to illustrate tht for me.  Everything on that list is important - but still a couple of items will magrate to next week's list because they are not ugent.  Those that genuinely are will always get done! <br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi learning as I go<br><br>Your post also illuminated something for me :-)  I realise that you are also a lot more current on stuff than I have been for a long time.  I am so looking forward to when I am genuinely clear of my legacy backlogs!  It will be interesting to see if my approach changes again at that time.....<br><br>The legacy of stuff to sort that arose when I was travelling for weeks on end would eventually have been managed if it had not been for subsequent family issues combined with health issues and made ten times worse by the fact that the sale of my business was badly managed leaving me with problems and debts that I am still sorting out.  Looking back to pre AF days, it is immensely frustrating to realise how much I had been tolerating, and I get such a buzz from seeing those issues get trashed - even if only one small load at a time. :-)<br><br>I know that, because I am always looking at things from the perspective of someone with a large backlog, that has a great influence on how I view things.  It is also very easy for perspective to be wrong and that is another great thing about AF.  When we hit difficult times there are sorts of emotions (as I know you will know only too well) and it is hard to get out of the "blame/fault/if only" cycle.  Although that part of the cycle is not only natural but essential - as part of the grieving process - there comes a time when we have to choose to move forward from we are now or forever harp back to what might have been.  AF, when used properly gives you the space to recognise how you feel, and the ability to act on that recognition when you are ready.  By enabling me to understand more about "how" I tick I can use that knowledge to find ways to manage it effectively. <br><br>As it is I can sit here at my desk - a vase of daffodils on the windowsill, the sun coming in through the window, and really enjoy the progress I am making.

<div class="content">Walter<br><br>Seems to me it is a moot point whether you should have gone through the CV immediately (would have stopped it festering in your mind and clogging your focus on other things) or followed the rules.<br><br>I'd just make two observations from my own experience. <br>1. Trying to integrate a completely different approach to AF into a system with AF reduces the efficacy of AF.<br>2. That doesn't mean that AF should be the master and you the servant. If you want to do something now, you probably should (no need to think of the something as being 'on another page' - simply the thing you want to do now). This is the ultimate of giving free rein to your intuition. What you do need to do is to keep an eye on the situation and make sure that it isn't just an excuse to avoid doing the things that are less interesting and that you are also working the system.<br><br>I'm aware of what's on my pages because I go through them often enough. If there's a particularly good time to do something (eg watering a plant when I'm already holding a watering can), I won't wait until I get to the right page.</div>

He, too, used to detest boredom!  LOL!  I think people who are values oriented and need to express their passions have a tough time with the mundane aspects of living.  He used to tell me to get those things out of my head.  He called it "worst first to clear the decks"  LOL!

When we lived in Europe, we used to take many mini-vacations.  I loved the train rides as well as time spent at our destination!  I used to love those porters attending to every need and want, the waiters in their crisp white jackets serving us delicious food and chilled wine.  (Yes, we were allowed to drink wine with our meals as children, LOL).  When I arrived in the states I was excited about going on the trains..........WHAT A LET DOWN!  It was like riding a bus!  UGH!  My point is.....sometimes the journey to a destination is just as important as reaching the destination.

<div class="content">Hi learning as I go<br><br>Your father sounds a wonderful inspiration, and as you say it sounds as though he really understood the techniques needed.  I love the BOO!  <br><br>Using AF has made me realise how long I have struggled with things - I remember vividly as a child loving doing jig-saws and my Mum taught me to lay the pieces out first so that I could see everything more clearly.  We also always covered the picture on the box so that the end result was more of a surprise.  I used to hate the laying out of the pieces - BORING!!! - so created my first procrastination buster technique at a very early age.  I used to halve the pieces, lay them out, then half what was left, and so on and so on until complete.  I had no idea that was a recognised tool at the age of 6 or 7 :-)<br><br>Thank you for your encouragement - your posts are always a real source of so much wisdom and inspiration - your father clearly passed on his legacy :-) I do feel for you with your health issues and can't imagine what that constant pain must be like.  I am experiencing some health issues myself at present and for the first time can relate to some of the problems of disability and that feeling of aging 30 years overnight.  When joints suddenly don't work as they should you realise how much you are reliant on the simplest things but I am still hopeful that my problems will be resolvable ....... nature's way of making me slow down ........ :-)<br><br>Hope you're also enjoying spring weather - I love this time of year!</div>

Just Monday, I noticed that I broke three toes.  They looked like huge purple fingers.  It wasn't until my neck let up on me that I realized that my toes hurt!  LOL!  I try to remember to be careful about noticing injuries when I'm in big pain....but a few slip by until I take a shower or ruin my dinner.  I don't cut up chickens any more for this reason!  LOL!  Oh well....the bright side is I feel fairly confident that I can do more despite the pain.  It takes a long time to get used to finding purpose and pleasure through chronic pain....especially the stun gun zaps from my spinal cord injury.  LOL!  At least I don't soil myself anymore.  It's like waking up a bit ahead of your alarm clock.  I focus on staying dry until it passes!  LOL!  LOL!

Focusing on what I'm doing fairly well despite the circumstances helps to keep my confidence up a bit longer.  I also journal because I don't talk about this too much to others.  I don't want to be branded as a "Pain Personality"  It's enough to hold my head up when people get testy because of my brain injuries!  LOL!  I'm fortunate that life still offers me much to be grateful for, yeah?  I try to squeeze out as much as I can of both myself and my life.....This is one area where my defiance helps me!

<div class="content">Hi Walter<br><br>It is hard to "let go" of those items that cause concern.  I have already posted about the fact that I do a MindMap of those "anxiety laden" tasks and just keep it to hand. That forms my security blanket as it were.  However what is really important is that I do not action tasks from that list.  I just park it on my desk and work through my lists in the normal way. When I subsequently review that MindMap I find that all of the genuinely urgent tasks have been done - within AF. Interestingly a few tasks have ended up not being done, and when I have looked at them I can see that they were not genuinely urgent.  My intuitive mind really DOES know best!<br><br>I started my MindMap because I had so many active pages and was not cycling through them daily.  However I can see the use of that as a temporary tool to provide that security whilst learning to Trust The System.

<div class="content">I have been using AF for the past 10 days and am loving it.  I was initially concerned about how to deal with urgency as well because I very often do have items that people would like my response sooner rather than later.  I wanted to trust the system and my own intuition and I know that even if I cycle through my entire list (current 10 active pages) in a single day that still might not be enough.<br><br>So before I pick up my list and begin the defined AF process I ask myself, "What is the next thing I need to be doing?"<br><br>If something comes to mind (usually something already on my list somewhere) I just do that immediately.  Regardless of what comes to mind or how important I think it is I just do it.  When I get to some point with that item where I feel I can move on I ask the question again and do whatever urgent task comes to mind until I get the signal to go ahead and work through my list.  That signal is usually just a sense of calm that I can work through the AF process at a relaxed pace.  <br><br>In the first few days I had a lot more emergencies to deal with.  Now I might get the signal to deal with something immediate a couple of times a day.  I feel like this respects my unconscious mind/intuition.  To blindly do the system in sequence to me feels like telling my inutition to shut up which is the opposite of what we want.  If something is urgent let your intuition tell you.  As Mark says, as you do the system and trust it those will likely be fairly uncommon.<br><br>Then again what do I know, I've only been at this 10 days or so.<br></div>

<div class="content">Christine, Andreas and all:<br><br>I find that people are often trying to remove one type of action or another out of the system. For some people it's urgent items, for others it's routine items, for others it's one project or another.

Here's an extract from yesterday's:<br><br>Do the dishes x3<br>Email x6<br>Reply to comments x3<br>Twitter x5<br>Check Share Prices x2<br>Read a Book x9<br><br>I did 26 unique tasks as well so there was a pretty good spread of action.<br><br>These were all done absolutely according to the rules. No tasks appeared more than once on the list - they were just re-entered as completed. I stuck religiously to the rules for items standing out and for moving from one page to another.<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi learning as I go<br><br>It sounds like your neighbour is a very wise and perceptive lady. I've never met you but I certainly admire you - it's what is inside that counts and your grace, humour and wisdom shine through.  You should type out that "Honey you're exactly the same. Only your circumstances have changed", put it where you can see it, and just carry on absorbing what she said!  You may not feel it but others definitely see it! :-)<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>you examples do not quite fit you opening statement. It can be a problem for example to mix projects and aactions from those projects in the same list. For example every spring I have to clean my convertible to get it ready for the warm weather. Clearly a small project. As part of the project I have to wash the car, vacuum it, polish it and so on. All individual tasks that are part of the spring cleaning project.<br><br>OK, this was an easy one where people wouldn't get easyly confused but I think one should either write all individual tasks in AF or just the project name and keep the parts somewhere else. Alternatively write project and task always together.<br><br>I think it is a valid idea to keep things in some kind of order, especially if you have a lot of things going on...</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark<br><br>Every time I have tried to manipulate the system it reduces it's efficiency.  I've not consciously omitted items (although some routines, such as dishes, now just get done as a matter of course when waiting for the kettle to boil).  However if I have/have had visitors and there is an urgency - then it goes on list.  Interestingly it goes on list BECAUSE it is more urgent.  Logic therefore says if that works for unimportant taks then wouldn't it also work for important tasks? :-)<br><br>I think the issue for most of us is that of "Trusting The System" but particularly where there are multiple externally imposed deadlines.  My Security Blanket Mindmap helps me get over that but only because I do not DO anything with it.  It's as though it's there to tell my rational mind to stop worrying - it's all covered, so that my intuitive side can just get on with things.  It's a bit like the annoying boss who is always flapping.  You know you have everything under control but to shut him/her up you humour them by sitting down and dutifully and obviously listing what "he/she" feels is important. That gets them off your back, you go back to doing what you were doing in the first place, get things done and everyone is happy!<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Klaus<br><br>I initially used to do an "either/or" approach but have changed my opinion.  My list grows by what I think of as a task "in the moment", whether it be the whole project (clean car) or an individual task (vaccuum car). I am quite likely to end up with both in my list, and with larger projects have related tasks both in groups and scattered throughout on varying pages.  If I do one, I will probably do others at the same time, so just cross the items off when I next cycle back to the relevant page.   <br><br></div>

<div class="content">Klaus:<br><br>Not sure why you think my examples don't fit my opening statement. They are all examples of routine actions which need doing on an at least daily basis and therefore are urgent as well as routine.<br><br>As for the project tasks, again I don't see any contradiction to what I said. You are free to enter tasks and projects in any way you like in AF. You can enter "Prepare convertible for warm weather" or "Polish car", or indeed both as Christine says.</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br>You are right, of course, I just focussed on the project bit and omitted the sentences before...<br><br>However I still am not comfortable in writing projects and tasks that are related in no particular order anywhere on the list. How do I make sure that there are no bits and pieces of a project somewhere that need to be finished, especially when it is not obvious that they belong to a certain project. As I said, I used a very simple example.<br><br>Finally I would very much like to know how the "throw everything into one pot" mentality works together with your statement that the project management is best done somewhere else?

<div class="content">Klaus:<br><br><<How do I make sure that there are no bits and pieces of a project somewhere that need to be finished, especially when it is not obvious that they belong to a certain project.>><br><br>To take the example you gave of the convertible, would you really need to manage this project at all? You presumably have done it before and know what is involved so you just get on and do it. However you might want to write out a checklist of actions which you can tick off as you do them. As you do this every year, you might look out the checklist you used last year.<br><br><<your statement that the project management is best done somewhere else>><br><br>I can't remember making that statement, and if I did what I meant by it would depend on the context. <br><br>Some projects require a lot of management, some like the convertible example don't. Managing a project is a task, or series of tasks, like any other. As such you do it any way you want to, just as you do any other task any way you want to. If you have a task in AF "Make a cup of coffee" you don't expect the AF system to tell you how to make a cup of coffee. Similarly if you have a task "Review project X" you don't expect AF to tell you how to do that.<br><br>I suppose I could sum it up by saying that AF is about managing tasks, not projects - but managing a project *is* a task.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Klaus<br><br>I understand your concern on the project related issues and I have found that the following works well, and is actually in line with Mark's last post :-)<br><br>For routine projects - such as the prepare convertible example you used, I would either have prepare convertible as my task in AF (on the basis that I knew through years of doing so what needed to be done or that I had a checklist elsewhere to which I would refer when I did the task)<br><br>For more complex projects I tend to find that the following has happened almost by natural development and I now trust it to work (it has not failed me yet and I have been an AFer since day one!. I jot tasks related to the project down as they come into my head on the AF list, and then end up adding fairly quickly asa task something like "Review/Action Project X).<br><br>I then perhaps block out some time if thats appropriate or do it when it stands out the "review/action Project X" task. This tends to involve some project planning e.g. scheduling, mind map the project, review AF list to pull out thoughts and tasks already noted. That effectively kicks the project off. Anything time sensitive goes into my schedule/calendar with an appropriate pre-warning alarm to the due date.<br><br>Then I have a regular AF task of "Review/Action Project X" which means I have it on my AF radar, i deal with time sensitive issues when they need to be via my schedule and others as they stand out. i use this for both Home and Work.<br><br>I think the key is integrating the schedule for time critical items, time blocking when necessary, using a regular prompt in your AF task list and making sure that you have put in sometime at the outset to know how you want to run your project, that way you know you have the bases covered.<br><br>Hope this helps, be happy to answer any specific queries if you would find that helpful.<br><br>Finally, i think we must not confuse the AF system with a project management system as Mark says regularly "AF is about managing tasks, not projects - but managing a project *is* a task". Once I had a lightbulb moment on that aspect i was off and running!!!<br><br>- titch</div>

<div class="content">Hi Klaus<br><br>I agree with titch - I have posted extensively on Project Management so won't repeat it here but AF manages my projects perfectly.  The "bits and pieces" scattered throughout the pages get mopped up naturally as part of the planning process.  In a review of "project x" I would expect my plan for any large project to have some reference to all the steps - as I go through my lists, odd steps here and there would automatically get scooped up into that plan and recycled back into the lists if and when appropriate.  If I have a large project and think of steps I want to add in, but know may be well down the line from an action perspective, my associated task may just be to "add idea y to plan for project x".  Working on the "whole project" in a Time Block, or individual bits and pieces (which may result in other tasks being actioned in conjunction) just happens naturally.</div>

<div class="content">Klaus:<br><br>The real difference between "Prepare Convertible" and "Build an oil platform" is not that one is more complex than the other, but that one involves coordinating the activities of hundreds of people and the other just the activities of one person - you.<br><br>That's why the oil platform requires project planning, and the other probably doesn't.<br><br>Your own sequence of actions within the oil platform  project would only a tiny fraction of the tasks that are coordinated. A point I've made before is that everyone in the world is filling 24 hours a day with a sequence of tasks. No one's life is more complicated than that!</div>

<div class="content">Mark<br><br>You are clearly correct in pointing to the difference between projects that demand co-ordination of a number of people and projects that involve only myself.<br><br>But I very rarely have to co-ordinate the efforts of others.  Does that mean that I do not need project planning?<br><br>My mother is in a nursing home and there are numerous fronts on which I have to plan and take action for her sake.

<div class="content">I have to say that I think the whole issue of project planning comes down to personal "needs" with regard to degree of structure in Project Management.  As has been posted in other threads, Project Management is a whole subject in itself.  I agree with Mark that AF can handle all of the tasks associated with a project of any complexity more than adequately but I really don't think that is the issue for many people.<br><br>I struggle with a structured approach to "doing" but still love structure (I've always said that my problem is that I love creating systems but hate following them!).  For me a Project Management is a necessity, not an optional tool - I have a NEED to feel in control of a project and for me that means some way of identifying progress.  I also have a NEED to know that the associated paraphernalia of any project is organised and that I can lay my hands on what I need at any given point in time.<br><br>Being in the position of sorting care issues for parents the volume of associated "stuff" is immense.  AF handles all the "doing" and so far beyond the way any other system has coped that it has no equal.  However I NEED a Project Management system for managing the "stuff"! That need is not just a "nice to have" - it is what keeps me sane :-) That "system" is where I go to maintain Carer Employment records, monitor time requirements, manage correspondence with all of the various parties, maintain medical records, contact details, plan for future needs, etc etc etc.  For me the answer to Mark's question "do you really need to do anything more than ....?"  is absolutely and definitively YES!  That has nothing to do with the system but everything to do with the way "I"need to operate - perhaps my Myers Briggs typing explains that :-)  For me, what I love about AF is that it's very flexibility facilitates that.</div>

<div class="content">Christine:<br><br>You certainly need to manage the "stuff" and you certainly need a system for doing so. But is that system a "project management" system, or a "managing stuff" system? There's a crucial difference in my eyes.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-04-17 13:37</div>
<div class="content">Hi Mark<br><br>I think that comes down to what we define as a project (and perhaps that is where some of the misunderstandings on this subject have arisen).  I don't see a project as necessarily needing to be a task of vast complexity requiring Gantt Charts and complicated interactions of steps.  To me a project, in it's simplest form, can be anything out of the ordinary that requires a number of steps, and on which it can be helpful to monitor progress in some way, or to co-ordinate associated stuff.  That is a very wide description which covers a lot of eventualities.  I have no doubt that things I define as projects may not be so for others.  Some things may be projects on occasion, and not on others.  For example, cleaning my kitchen is a series of routine tasks.  I do not see it as a project per se.  However, if I decide to Spring Clean, revamp my kitchen, or something similar, I may well create "a project", albeit temporary, to manage it.  You can just as easily say, "well that can be done my means of a checklist".  Absolutely and so it is, but to me that is still a form of project management, albeit on a small scale.<br><br>To me a Filing System is a form of project management - it is definitely the management of stuff, but I don't see the need for a different system to manage one type of "stuff" from another.  "Stuff" is "stuff", regardless of complexity and if I can have "one" system that can just as easily manage a project to "Start New Business" as to "clean kitchen" well that is all I need.  To me it ranks alongside the fact that in AF "stack dishwasher" can sit comfortably next to "Take over World". It is not the quality of the task (or "stuff") that is relevant, but the way in which it is managed.<br><br>I think the only difference is that you differentiate between "stuff" and "projects" whereas I incorporate the two.  Does that help explain where I am coming from with this.....? :-)</div>

<div class="content">Christine:<br><br>I am using the GTD definition of "project" which is anything which can't be done in one session.  And in GTD all such projects need to be managing by listing next actions etc. <br><br>What I am trying to get away from is the idea that this is necessary in AF. AF works on very different principles from GTD, and the vast majority of "projects" can be managed perfectly happily on the task list without any additional levels of management. On the occasions when they can't, then the management of the project becomes a task like any other.<br><br>As I said above, A project needs as much planning as is appropriate for that project - no more and no less.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark<br><br>So what it then boils down to is what is "appropriate" and that I suspect may vary from person to person.  I absolutely agree that AF can handle any size of project by the management of the actions.  What is important for me is that additional level of overview (which for many would provide the ability to report status to management).  It is entirely possible that, because my creation of project management systems for any organisation have always been with that end in mind, that my view is coloured by that. Certainly I have no issue with AF's ability to control all aspects of a project. As for "the management of the project becomes a task like any other." that is exactly the way I now "manage" my projects, by means of a task in AF :-)<br></div>
