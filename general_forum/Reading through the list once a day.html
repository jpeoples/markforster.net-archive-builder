<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">I apologize if this has been covered before, but I could not find a definite answer to this question and the questions being asked and the concerns being raised on this forum seem to indicate that this question either has not occurred to others or has not been answered for them either.<br><br>Now here's my question: Per the instructions, aren't we supposed to read through the ENTIRE LIST once a day?<br><br>I am referring to this DO: <br>DO read through all the outstanding items on your list when you come back to it after an extended break. This will help your mind to get an overview of what needs to be done.<br><br>To me this suggests I am to read EVERY outstanding (i.e. all but done and dismissed) item "after an extended break," which would certainly be a night's rest.<br><br>Mark, I would be very happy if you could just quickly let me know whether my understanding of the instructions regarding this is correct or whether I am mistaken.  Again, I apologize if this has already been covered.  If it has, I will happily follow any redirect to the original post. <br><br>Thank you!<br><br>Joshua</div>

<div class="content">Joshua:<br><br>By "extended break" I meant if you were away for a day or more. But it certainly doesn't do any harm to read the list right through every day.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>Thank you very much for your quick response!<br><br>This is something that helps me "combat" the fear of losing track of something important.  Given the size of my lists (private and work) it takes me between 30 mins and 45 mins to read them through once, but I figure the time is well invested.<br><br>All the best,<br><br>Joshua</div>
