<div class="content">I have written before on this forum that the main difficulty I am encountering with AF it that I find it hard to discard tasks.  However, I have been managing it better recently, because I am going skiing next week.  I have been rejecting any task that there is no prospect of getting done, or even advancing slightly, before I go.   I am identifying the ones so junked in a distinctive way so that I can consider restoring them to the list when I return.<br><br>Is there any value to making a habit of using medium-term deadlines for list filtering?</div>

<div class="content">Hi David<br><br>I think we all feel an aversion to the concept of dismissing items as it goes against what we have always done.  Even those tasks we really do not want to do we have a feeling that we "ought" to do them - almost a sentimental attachment if you like.<br><br>I think that the fact that a deadline has made you act decisively on these items will probably just have been the catalyst you needed at this point and you will probably find that it flows a lot better when you return.  <br><br>My gut feeling would be that it would not be a good idea to create a false deadline as it could instead create a false sense of security and "allow" you to hang on to items that you should have acted on.  Now that you have recognised that you could dismiss those items I think that will be all that you need.<br><br>Enjoy the skiing!</div>
