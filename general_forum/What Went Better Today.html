<div class="content">From The Mindfulness Solution, by Ronald D. Siegel, page 317 of my Kindle edition: <br><br>"THREE GOOD THINGS<br><br>   Each evening for a week, write down three things that went well that day and what caused them to go well.<br>   That's all there is to it. Remarkably, in large-scale surveys of people who tried this, most found that it significantly decreased depressive symptoms and increased positive moods for the next six months."<br><br>The is very similar to Mark's advice in his Dreams book, to make a list of what went better. The big difference is that this asks you to write down what caused the thing to go better. I believe that that extra step could be important because it compels me to make the association with being persistent, organized, sociable, etc.<br><br>I am going to start doing this when I daily my daily What Went Better list (using iDoneThis as Mark once recommended).<br><br>(By the way, even apart from this little tip, I found Siegel's book extraordinarily helpful.)</div>

<div class="content">Good idea. I never keep that type of routine up long enough to get the full benefit. It helps for a day or two, then plateaus and I drop it before the routine really gains traction.</div>
