<div class="content">Okay, here's the idea. :-) Several things in life have similar character to tasks, and can benefit from systematic processing.  Books, food, and clothing work like activity:<br><br>1) We accumulate lots of them<br>2) Over time we go through them<br>3) Once something is started, it's often a good idea to finish.<br>4) Some stuff never gets used and should be tossed.<br><br>These could call for a simple system to manage things.  Because I haven't yet been systematic about this, my frozen foods are getting burn, my produce spoils before I get to it, my books get started but not finished (some of which I should get rid of because they aren't worth finishing), and some of my clothes take closet space without ever getting worn.<br><br>So the idea is to implement an AutoFocus type system for each of these.  This could be done by writing in a book, but it could also be done by arranging shelf space.  In a SuperFocus system, you systematically scan through a shelf (or a written list), activate stuff (start reading a book, open a package), dismiss stuff that's neglected (throw out, or move to storage), note the lettuce is urgent, and enter the recurring "buy milk" when the milk is gone.<br><br>I won't present any rules now, but I will note the following:<br>1. Don't systematize everything at once; you'll drive yourself crazy.  Pick one topic.<br>2. The dynamics are different.  AF1, SF, DWM won't work.  An alternate system is needed.<br>3. Have fun :-)</div>

<div class="content">I use a very simple system for books and clothing (I haven't tried it for food).<br><br>Put a task "Weed books" or "Weed clothes" in whatever system you are using.<br><br>When the task comes up, go through your books or clothes and throw out any you know you don't want any longer. It may only be a few.<br><br>Repeat the task after a day or two. Keep doing this until no more stand out for disposal.<br><br>This method is simple and effective. Each time you go through the books or clothes you will find some more will stand out. When this no longer is the case, you will know you have finished the weeding. <br><br>What's more your mind will have internalised the reasons why you haven't thrown away the remaining ones, which makes it more likely that they will get read/worn.</div>

<div class="content">Alan,<br><br>My initial reaction is that these "things" (or "stuff" as David Allen would say) all have Tasks (or Next Actions) that apply to them. The examples you list have some fairly obvious chore-type thinning/replenishing tasks that apply, e.g.: (1) Donate some books and clothes; (2) Toss spoiled, expired, and freezer-burned food; and (3) Shop for groceries. I don't see any reason why "the dynamics are different" or why "AF1, SF, DWM won't work" or why "an alternate system is needed."  Perhaps you are thinking too hard, or making too much of some straightforward home chores?<br><br>Regarding the unworn clothes-in-closet problem, I read about an interesting technique awhile back, but haven't tried it yet.  The idea is to turn all the hangers around (hooked from the inside), and only hang an item back up in the normal way after you've worn it. After some prescribed time (6 months, 1 year?), take all the unworn (backward-hung) items out and donate them.</div>

<div class="content">(1) Donate some books and clothes; <br>Why get rid of good stuff? I'd read the books if I get to them.  The clothes only languished because they were at the back and I never saw them. <br><br>(2) Toss spoiled, expired, and freezer-burned food; and<br>Wouldn't it be better to have a plan that gets food eaten before it expires?<br>Plan meals based on what you have and what's expiring. Plan shopping to fit ingredients that are sitting in the cupboard.  Systematically go through stuff so everything bought eventually gets to the plate.</div>

<div class="content">(1) I agree with Alan.  I need a very systematic approach in order to fight resistance and boredom if the project needs to be done by little and often approach.  Tasks like "weed books" or "weed clothes" just get dismissed unless I can dedicate enough time to finish the entire project before starting something a new one.<br>(2) We are all very different.  For some, these are just everyday chores that are done automatically. Others require an external motivation system or things fall through the cracks.  One unnecessary scrap of paper on my desk can prevent me from being fully productive or even can make me feel overwhelmed; it needs to be discarded because it's in my line of vision and I remember why it is there. At the same time a huge pile of papers at the edge of the desk can sit forgotten and untouched for years. Calling it a backlog, putting a reminder into AF or SF to "weed the backlog" doesn't change anything in my brain until a day when I just decide to deal with it and go through everything at once discovering many things that I forgot I even had.  But if it's lettuce it can't wait.</div>

<div class="content">+JMJ+<br><br>Alan, isn't your system perfectly suited for the Food part? Your system accommodates a calendar system, so why not<br><br>1) Schedule a day every week when to inventory the contents of your refrigerator<br>2) Schedule a day every week when you will look through the inventory and schedule each day of the current week for each item in your fridge.  For example, chicken breasts for Monday, beef brisket on Tuesday, fish on Wednesday, etc.<br>3) Schedule a day or more each week when you have to go the grocery to replenish your supplies.<br><br>God bless.</div>

<div class="content">Ilse:<br><br>A more brutal way to deal with a backlog of anything is to destroy it all. Give yourself a week to remove anything you really need/want to keep - otherwise everything goes.<br><br>Of course rather than literally destroy it, you may choose to give it away or sell it - but it must be got rid of.</div>

<div class="content">Clothing - Twice a year I do a "Closet Turnover" to get out/put away winter vs. summer clothes.  I don't need an external reminder.  When I get to the point of having to start digging around, climbing to high shelves looking for clothes for the other season, then I'm motivated to do the turn.<br><br>Hanging clothes - I always hang clothes back up on the far left of my closet.  So I can tell which items I've worn most recently and which I haven't worn in ages.  I have some brightly colored hangers, different from my other hangers.  Each time I turnover my closet, I hang up one of these at the far left.  So by counting thru these hangers from left to right, I can tell the last season when I wore an item.  If I haven't worn it in two years, it goes (trash or donate).<br><br>Folded clothes - I have two long shelves.  At the start of each season, I put all the folded items on the high, top shelf.  Then as I wear & wash them, I put them back on the bottom shelf.  So at the end of the season, I can tell which items I never wore (they're still on the top shelf) and get rid of as much as possible.</div>

<div class="content">Mostly I consider this thread fun.  These aren't life-shattering issues, and solutions probably aren't hard to come by if you put your mind to it.  Mark wrote <I'm sure OneNote has the solution. ><br><br>Actually in this case I think OneNote is not limiting enough :-)  A paper approach, or maybe glass beads would serve better.  :-)<br><br>More seriously, I'm partial to Elynn's approach to clothing here.</div>

<div class="content">I have a variety of ways to cycle things, depending on the item and space.<br><br>It has to be easy to put away new things, and easy to get at what you need for today.<br><br>I put new food at the back of the shelf, so it's harder for the rest of the family to get to. I also make date labels. I have a box of return-address labels and run them through the printer. I go through about one page of labels per season, which is fine-grained enough for the purpose. A date-stamp is cheap and works. I tried using colour-coding rather than words, but quickly forgot the colour code.<br><br>Every spring I start the towel cycle. Again, the family takes from the easiest shelf. As that shelf clears, I move the uncycled towels to that shelf and put the cycled towels on the high shelf.<br><br>For cycling through the kids' clothes, I have a basket in the laundry room. I choose one item (e.g. Tshirts) and, as each one is cleaned, I put it in the basket. The kids have to put one shirt from their drawer in the "too small" pile each day before taking one from the basket. That's a compromise, so they don't spend all morning trying to find something that fits. I only do one item at a time.<br><br>I used to cycle my clothes by putting clean clothes at the far end, but that's had to reach. All my fancy clothes migrated to the easy-to-reach end. Now I put clothes back in the easiest place. The clothes I never wear migrate to the back corner. Every week or two I pull something from that corner and think about it.<br><br>Folders for active projects go on an active shelf. That pile is small enough that order doesn't matter, but ease of access is crucial. When I realize a project is inactive (sleeping or finished), it goes on the reference shelf.<br><br>One person has to have several different ways of cycling things, depending on the physical layout and the other people using the system.</div>
