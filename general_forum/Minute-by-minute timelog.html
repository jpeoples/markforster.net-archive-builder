<div class="content">Hi everyone - I decided this morning to try DIT again, making a fresh start.  I'm also completing a timelog of what I actually do.  When I've done this in the past I've tended to round the number of minutes up or down to make it look 'neat', but I think it'll be more interesting and illuminating to write down every activity, even if it only lasts one minute - after all, activities that just take a couple of minutes add up to a substantial amount over the course of a day..  No doubt this will be too much overhead, but it'll be fun to see how it goes.</div>

<div class="content">I did the same thing for several weeks and found it really helpful.   I think I will try to repeat it every six months or so.</div>

<div class="content">I've had mixed results results with time-tracking. One thing I learned, the time/activity data alone needs to be accompanied by other contextual informatio (amount of sleep, mood, sick or not, etc) to better inform me of what happened on a specific day.</div>

<div class="content">avrum, I agree.   Together with the time log, I would try to capture things like this:<br>- meeting results/outcomes/observations<br>- what went well / went poorly / seemed surprising about particular tasks<br>- reflections on the day as a whole<br><br>This helped me:<br>- realize overall how much a huge time sink meetings usually are, compared to the value of the meeting<br>- realize that an awful lot of real results on a project can be accomplished in 20 minutes or less<br>- identify repeating tasks that can be streamlined with a better process, or performed less frequently, or eliminated<br>- simply be more conscious of how much time things really take to accomplish, vs the value generated<br>- identify the tasks I should be focused on personally, and other things I should delegate or eliminate</div>

<div class="content">Just like to add my experiences. Now 15 days into time logging experiment inspired by Margarett's initial posting and subsequent comments. Getting good results.<br>Method-use lined notebook, track in 15 min sections.<br><br>Started, out of desperation -to use as a method to overcome severe lethargy ,time-wasting. and high resistance to doing what needed to be done. Felt I needed to more easily see and feel the value of my time. <br>After a few days, added a quick morning review-quick list of achievements, quick review of what could have gone better, and rough idea of what i want to/need to do today.<br>Certainly got me out of a rut, and as after two weeks, feels sustainable.</div>
