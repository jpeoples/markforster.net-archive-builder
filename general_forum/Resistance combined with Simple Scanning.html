<div class="content">I've been reading about doing what you resist the most first in Mark's book How to Get Everything Done.  The book recommends asking yourself the question "what do I most resist now?"<br><br>I have tried it today, but find myself wanting to simply scan my long list too.  How do I combine something great like "what do I resist?" and writing down the answer, together with a long list of items that I need or want to do?  Also, if I resist something but cannot act on it at all, do I just move on to the next highest resistance item?  I like long lists, but I also like...what is it called here...the no-list where you think of something and then write and it down and then do it?  <br><br>When I use a long list I know I am covering my bases on everything that has my attention to get done.  When I just write stuff down and do it as I think about it, I am more intuitive in tackling the highest resistance item first (so far today in trying it) so I get some great things done.</div>

<div class="content">I've tried these resistance-based methods a few times. I found they can be useful to break through a pile of difficult work that's become stuck, and get things moving again. But I didn't find it useful for an ongoing day-to-day system. <br><br>Also, you can get many of the same benefits from any No-List system, as you've noted. And No-List methods are quite sustainable for long periods. Your intuition pulls you to the things that really need to be done first, high resistance or not, and it just seems easier to get moving on them. Especially combined with the Dynamic List idea. The dynamic lists break the difficult task down into things you can do immediately. It keeps it fresh and practical. <a href="../blog/Dynamic Lists.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2016/2/13/dynamic-lists.html</a></div>
