<div class="content">My trouble with all the "common sense" rules is when they get triggered too often.  <br><br>If I have one or two items that are governed by "common sense", then I can keep track of how to handle them.  They are just one or two exceptions -- no big deal.<br><br>Maybe even 3 or 4 would be OK.<br><br>But when the number starts to climb, I suddenly no longer have a system.  And personally I find that I work best with a real, consistent *system*.    Even if it's just Gerry's simple "write it all in one place" system.   <br><br>Actually, whenever AF1 broke down for me, I used Gerry's approach as a fallback.  I just processed the same list but didn't really use any rules.   And then, after the crisis of the day subsided, I could try to get back to actually following the AF rules.   The problem was, I got sloppier and sloppier over time, till the days I was actually using the rules were the exception and the random cherry-picking was the rule.  And I lost all feeling for the intuitive aspect of AF.<br><br>That's what I am afraid of with SF, if I need to play the "common sense" card too often.   I want the rules to WORK, 99% of the time.    SF gets pretty close.    I am trying to think of how to work it properly, so it really does achieve that.   Mark's absence is forcing me to think through it all myself, which is fun and challenging.</div>

<div class="content">This is indeed a challenge, for me too. My suggestion: when chaos arrives, do what you have to when you have to. As soon as there's no "have to", immediately go back to the system.</div>

<div class="content"><<As soon as there's no "have to", immediately go back to the system. >><br><br>If I understand SF correctly, column 2 was designed to do just that i.e. "have to". My problem is simple: If I get stuff done sans system, I think to myself: "Feh, I got stuff done without gtd/af/gsd/SF/7 Habits.... and I'm back to square 1 (that being, oscillating between Quad 1 and Quad 2 activity).</div>

<div class="content">Alan wrote:<br><< As soon as there's no "have to", immediately go back to the system. >><br><br>That's the problem.  It starts to build resistance.  It's not so easy to "immediately go back".<br><br>When I'm working off-system, I am chasing the most urgent thing.  After awhile, I chase whatever happens to be moving the fastest or has the brightest colors, masquerading as urgent.  I get tired and fuzzy-minded and don't WANT to go back to a system.  Just can't handle it.  The chaos has worn me out, the cherry-picking has broken all my intuition and I am just NOT anywhere near "the zone" or the "mind like water".    Trying to figure out what task is "standing out" just seems too hard -- my mind puts up resistance to it.<br><br>And that resistance grows.   Making it harder to get back into the system.   Especially when I know the system isn't as reliable as I'd like it to be.   I want to TRUST it.   But when I have to invoke the "common sense" rule too many times, what does that mean, but that I can't really trust the system?    It needs so many "common sense" overrides to make it work when the road becomes difficult.<br><br>This is why I keep asking about the rules and how they apply in a particular situation.   They might seem like edge-cases to some, but for me they are real situations.   I need to know I can trust the system, that I can follow its rules and it will work just fine in these situations, 99% of the time.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim, I'd really be interested with a concrete example of how you work the system... Some scans of your pages or a Skype conversation. I found the rules really clear and self reliant. I encountered the least resistance to tasks with SF3. I honestly have a hard time seeing how it can be so difficult in any environment. Could you share some insight from your perspective with actual concrete examples?</div>

<div class="meta">2011-03-2 7:55</div>
<div class="content">Hi Erik,<br><br>The rules are clear.  My problem is always the volume of tasks I am dealing with.  In Autofocus I typically had over 1200 tasks across 30+ pages.  In DWM I also leveled off at about 1200 tasks.  (DWM worked pretty well with this actually...)   With SF it's stayed smaller, longer, but it still hasn't leveled off.   Part of this is being overcommitted both at home and at work.   Part of it is I like to explore and still imagine that the Internet is finite.  :-)    (Mark's systems have cured me of quite a lot of these problems already, but the tendency is still there!)    <br><br>The main issue is when I find I am processing pages more slowly than I am adding new ones.  The last page gets further and further away.<br><br>Here's how a typical page works for me.  Let's say I have 2 or 3 unfinished tasks I am trying to move forward.  One major one, one or two medium ones.   Then I get hit with 5 or 6 urgent tasks that must be done within the next few hours (phone call from boss, coworkers, urgent meeting that generated urgent action items, wife needs help with picking up the kids or something, Outlook reminder reminds me to do this or that daily recurring task, etc.).  The last page is about 4 or 5 pages away -- well outside the range I could expect to reach in a few hours.  Thus almost all those tasks all go in Column 2, current page.<br><br>So I keep cycling through my current page, following the "standing out" rules.  I take action on the urgent tasks, finishing most in one go, but one or two need to be moved along to the next page.  Meanwhile I have a phone meeting or two (there goes an hour or more!); then I often need to take the minutes for these and send them out, which also become urgent tasks.<br><br>Many C1 tasks get actioned along the way, since I am cycling through and working on whatever stands out.   When I first came to this page, almost none of those items stood out.  But I find that the more urgent tasks I add, the more time I spend on the page, cycling through.  And that repeated cycling breaks down resistance to the C1 tasks -- "get it done already!"   So, many of these get actioned, many completed, maybe 1 or 2 passed along to the next page.   <br><br>LOTS of work is getting done.   But I spend lots of time on each page.  Combined with the meetings, going through this one page can easily take 2-4 hours.<br><br>So, I finally come to the next page.  There's already half a dozen items in C2 -- many still urgent and relatively small, plus some larger items, and usually only 1 really large item.   I follow the rules:  quickly read through the whole list, then start back at the beginning and take action on whatever stands out.  Usually there are at least 1 or 2 C1 items that are already completed -- I just cross them out  (which happens to save the whole page from dismissal).   The other C1 items usually don't draw any of my attention -- it's the C2 items that do.  So, I work on them, one after another, usually finishing many of them, but maybe some of them getting moved along to the next page.   (I just follow the rule, "work as long as you want to".)<br><br>Then, there's another meeting.  And another urgent reminder.  (Some of the urgent things are Outlook reminders of tasks that need to be done daily -- and I really LOVE how SF handles them!)   And then an urgent request from someone at work, or maybe from my wife.  <br><br>On a typical visit to a page, C2 usually already has 4-6 urgent tasks that resulted from Outlook reminders, and another 1-3 urgent tasks that come up while processing the page, and then 1-3 unfinished carry over items.   <br><br><br>Overall I love how it flows, I love how much I get done, and I am happy to keep working my list from when I get up till way past the time I should be in bed.  It really does keep you "in the zone" -- by definition, actually.<br><br>Again, the main issue is when I find I am processing pages more slowly than I am adding new ones.  The last page gets further and further away.   I start to lose track of what's in my list -- especially older pages that I visited several days ago.   I don't know when this process will end -- will my list of tasks grow indefinitely?   Or will it reach an equilibrium?<br><br>DWM *forces* an equilibrium -- and that worked great for me.   I really got a sense of the size of my total workload, and whether it was getting to be too much, or whether it was OK for me to take on something new.<br><br>AF never did that.  And so far, I don't see SF doing that.  It just keeps growing.<br><br>Ideally, I'd want to see pages being completed faster than they are added -- this means I am clearing backlogs -- and then eventually I'd want to see an equilibrium established, where the total number of open pages stays about the same from day to day.  I think I could do that, if I could move more quickly through the pages.   <br><br>That's why I am trying (starting tomorrow) to enter urgent items on NEXT page, C2 -- Mark said this made it go too fast for him.   But that's exactly what I need right now.</div>

<div class="content">I've been lurking a long time but ony just joined the forum. Ive read a lot of what you've been saying Seraphim and one thing struck me. I hope you wont mind me saying so.<br><br>Youve identified the problem yourself. Its nothing to do with SF3 or any other system. You can fiddle all you like with the system, but the systems not the problme.<br><br>Youre overcommitted. That's your problem. Not the system. Do you really expect a system to sort that out for you? <br><br>Go through your 1200 tasks and cut it down by 9/10. Remember what Mark says in DIT Don't cut tasks on their own. Cut commitments. And when you've done it don't let any new ones in without getting rid of an old one.</div>

<div class="content">@Seraphim: I agree with Meryl 100% (again, see another topic, great minds think alike, fools seldom . . . oops, Roger, stop the sarcasm NOW!)<br><br>Perhaps because I have found myself overwhelmed by the sheer volume of outstanding tasks sometimes, I empathise with you.<br><br>Perhaps you do need to set aside a quiet time and place on your own and go through the active tasks, maybe in blocks of 50.<br><br>For really dramatic effect, ask yourself what would happen to other people in your life if you were physically unable to do each task, due to context/illness/other reasons or death (!).  If a task has a perceived nil or minimal effect, then dismiss or delete it.<br><br>For other that may have an impact or if you're unsure, transfer these to a separate list (I call mine 'LTBW' = 'Let The B*****d Wait'), then just put in eg LTBW in your active and now shorter task list and revisit this separate list from time to time, maybe as a 'break'.<br><br>It's similar to reviewing dismissed tasks, or a project with lots of individual tasks.</div>

<div class="content">You know, if you just get through the list a couple times, the pages are shorter and you'll pick up fewer things. But I see that 6 urgent items really messes up the whole flow. The system would be better if you ignored it to process those urgent items because there's so many.<br><br>As for resistance to returning, I feel that too, and my remedy is Mark's "I'll just take out the book". Then I "just" scan the active page. Scan again. And again. Now I'm in the mood for one thing, do it, carry on. And take it as a "must do" to take out the book.</div>

<div class="content">Hmmm, Meryl beat me to it.<br>You are DEFINITELY overcommitting but...<br>There is a solution that I have found in your use of the system.<br>I might take this out of context so excuse me for pointing it if it is but there are 3 things I think would help a lot and all of them are linked to dismissing. Taking tasks is ok, the system should filter out overcommitment easily by dismissing. That's why it's there for.<br><br>First: Learn or re-learn to dismiss. Dismissing doesn't mean you won't get to it at some point, it only means you have to re-assess your priorities and commitments (one thing done for overcommitting ;)<br><br>Second: You are probably using more common sense then rules then most people. Let me explain: If you get to a page and cross off C1 stuff because it was done earlier and simply work on C2 stuff then you HAVE to dismiss that entire page, period. You haven't worked on a C1 task on your pass of the page... Since you dismiss, you are relieving overcommitting again ;)<br><br>You are basically using your intuition to do that stuff that was crossed at a more opportune moment which is good but not using the "rules" of the system (hence my saying that you use more common sense then probably most people do). The system is there to balance the relative difficulties/commitments of the tasks by page increments allowing the alleviation of procrastination by comparing one task with another on that list/page. And to finally leave you with all the stuff you are not really committed to or haven't well defined and having to dismiss it... for now. You seem to often do stuff that is not even on the current page, using your better judgment on what the situation is at the moment. All good, but diluting the cycling through the pages.<br><br>Third: Often, some things on a page will stand out but you know theres more important stuff on a later page so my advice is that you do one task and move on. Later you'll come back and that stuff will be past due so not necessary to do anymore, guess what you just alleviated overcommitting again ;) If you don't have variation in task difficulties, everything will seem urgent. Give it 1 hour by putting it at the end of your list and you'll see the world won't stop turning.<br><br>It's simple, your pages should get dismissed as fast as you put stuff in.<br>Tell us what you think?</div>

<div class="meta">2011-03-2 15:10</div>
<div class="content">But this is ridiculous. If the solution to Seraphims problem is to dismiss half of what he puts in his list, then u have to ask why he's putting so much on his list that he doesnt need to do. And the same with DWM. Whats all this stuff that hes puting on his list that gets dismissed? Why's it a good thing it gets dismissed? Because he didnt need to do it in the first place thats why.<br><br>What he wants is a system that will allow him to put even more on the list so even more can get dismissed. Well to my mind thats just crazy. No offense intended.</div>

<div class="content">@Meryl<br><br>Me thinks it's a personality thing. Some people just NEED to have the freedom to think they can try to do any and everything they think about, or else they just feel too limited and get frustrated with their life, which can lead to impaired creativity, and maybe even loss of joie de vivre, and depression ? <br><br>Yes, everybody SHOULD be a realist, but not everybody is able to (without eventually feeling alienated).  <br><br>So maybe, for creative / idealist types, DWM would be the better system  by letting them "dream on" while still keeping them honest, vs SF which would inflict the dreaded "column 2 pain" as "punishment" for being such an "irresponsible" person (which would end up making them feel miserable) ?<br><br>These are just thoughts that popped out without much consideration, I haven't even tryed either system yet...</div>

<div class="meta">2011-03-2 16:25</div>
<div class="content">Seraphim,<br><br>I don't think any system will fix the issue of over commitment.  Time management systems will not limit your commitments, pick your priorities nor will they make you work faster - only you can do these things.  If the rule says you need to dismiss something because you have not worked on it, but you know it needs to get done you are at a logjam.  <br><br> I think the overhang of systems and rules may be a drag on your productivity and major distraction for you.  <br><br>I would suggest you stick to "write it all in one place" for a week or two, let your mind be your guide and forget everything else. Then see what you really need in the way of a system.  Good luck<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">Meryl<br><br>I was rather talking about myself there, because although I havent used SF3 yet Im pretty sure I would run into the same problems (overcommitment related) that Seraphim is currently confronted to.  But it might not be for the same reasons : from what Ive read, Seraphim is probably more of a responsible person that I am and his problem could rather be related to (as Alan stated it) "Lots of interruptions, little free time".<br>The result is still the same however : "overcommitment", and the REAL solution also is the same : be more realistic about what you assign yourself to do.<br><br>That being said, after reading your last post, Im not sure you would be able to understand the time (or rather life) management issues of the "creative/idealist" people I was talking about :<br><br>The "creative whatnots" and "fantasy stuff", as you put it, that these people come up with, NEED to be adressed by the system so they can get a chance to become a part of the "real world". This is the very reason these people are living for... a life filled with nothing but doing the most mundane stuff, or just the stuff they "really have to do", is not worth living for them. As I said, it's a personality thing.<br><br>Anyway looking back at my post i realize I expressed myself clumsily :<br>The good thing about DWM seems to be that it forces people to be more honest with their commitments : simply following the rules takes care of PREVENTING overcommitment.<br><br>On the other hand, follwing the rules of SF3 does not prevent overcommitment, but the system will eventually "crash" if one doesnt prevent overcommiting BY HIMSELF.<br><br>It seems like the "chronic overcommitter" (which are often creative/idealist types) can find a cure to his bad habits in DWM, while SF would only make him feel miserable not be be able to make such a sensible system work.</div>

<div class="content">Im sure I'm not capable of understanding anything Daouda. But it seems common sense to me that the worst place to write down all your creative/idealistic stuff is on the list of things youre going to do. If you want to build castles in the air then the air is the place to build them.<br><br>Some other guy was talking about Tolstoy on another thread. I guess he was about as creative/idealistic as you can get but I bet he spent his time writing his novels, not inventing another million things he could do but would never get round to.</div>

<div class="content">"Youre overcommitted. That's your problem. Not the system. Do you really expect a system to sort that out for you? " <br><br>The answer is to this is yes.  In fact SF3 is not intended for the things you will do, but only the things you might do.  They aren't commitments at all!  SF does balance your work, eventually reaching the following equilibrium:<br><br>new stuff - stuff finished = stuff dismissed.<br><br>In Seraphim's case, new stuff grows too fast, and we need to reduce that or accelerate dismissal.  If there's a lot of duplication, maybe altering the system to get around to stuff faster will suffice.  Certainly getting around faster will turn on the column 2 dismissal rule quicker.  <br><br>Also having more urgent stuff will turn on that rule quicker.  And maybe that fact should be considered a good thing, same as the DWM waterfall is a good thing, and not be fought against.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim,<br><br>You are certainly a valued member of this forum and no one can critique someone else's list without seeing it.<br><br>But 1200 tasks is going to strike a lot of people as too many. If you action one task every 2 minutes, it would take 40 hours to finish all the tasks. If you replace them as often as you work through the list, you would have to action and add about 240 every day (eight hours a day).<br><br>Even if many of these are sometime/maybe, it is still an awful lot of items to sift through every day. You indicate that you would have trouble keeping up with everything if they are not on the list, but it has got to be hard to keep from losing items that are on the list itself simply due to its shere size.<br><br>We don't participate in these forums only to find help, but to guide others. If the system is succeeding or failing for someone, it helps to know the circumstances. SF v.3 works well for me, but then again I have six open pages with only 44 open tasks and currently two in column two. I am using this at home and do not face many really urgent tasks, so it is easy for me. I see SF as little more than AF 1 with an added pop. SF will be a completely different situation for someone with hundreds of tasks, a disorganized boss, and less discrecionary time. My suggestions may not apply. If the system is not working as well for you, it is important that we sift through your circumstances to some extent, even if it seems cruel, because it is important to note what is and is not causing the problem as a means of maybe guiding someone who is absolutely new to this whole web site.</div>

<div class="content">Well, Seraphim, I did read some of what Mark and you talked about the system, and my memory is that he didn't say that the system could deal with tons and tons of irrelevant stuff being thrown at it. My memory is that he said that the system would seize up if people abused it and that would help to cure people of abusing it. Which sort of comes back to what I was saying.</div>

<div class="content">Don't worry, I won't post my task list.   I am fine having a long list of tasks.   I don't recall asking for help in reducing its size.  The only reason I mentioned it is because Erik asked me to describe my list and what's on it and how I typically process it.   :-)<br><br>My point in opening this thread was not to find help in reducing my number of tasks.   Rather, it was to observe that frequent invocation of the "common sense" rule leads to my mind getting muddled and my attention getting unfocused.  It also builds resistance to using the system at all.  I was wondering if anyone else has had that experience.<br><br>When I post questions about how the system is supposed to work, about 80% of the answers are "Good grief, just use common sense!"   Do you mean, "Good grief, please go muddle your mind, get unfocused, and build resistance to the system!"   Of course not.  :-)<br><br>Whenever it's Mark who is responding like that to my questions, I know I have just surprised him again with my large load of tasks and how his latest invention is responding to the stress test.

Most of the people here seem to find him almost "crazy", even myself am in awe in front of the 1200 number, but you can be sure someone in the world reading this on the internet can exactly relate to his situation. Seraphim, Im 100% sure you are not alone, and your experiments with the system are eventually gonna be useful to many. I think (hope) that Mark, who probably would never have thought by himself that someone could push his system to such limits, will eventually modify the final instructions in some way to adress the issues that you are exposing.

<div class="content">Seraphim, great to see how you are taking the advice people give. Not everybody can be as open minded as you :)<br><br>As for the "no-evil" thing, it was a figure of speech as well as a wink in the sense that there is no evil there. But after thinking about it, there is the fact that one needs to control some urges,... maybe.</div>

<div class="content">I feel as Alan on the debate/positiveness thing :)<br>As for the urgent going on next page, from the first time I heard of it, I made it mine. It tests the small possibility that I thought it was urgent and in reality, it wasn't. If it was, I'll move to the next page pretty quick. If it wasn't, then I won't have lost time over it at that moment. The next time similar task pops up, I'm sure to put it in C1 from the start.</div>

My oldest SFv3 page is dated 2/7/11.  I suppose I could try dismissing anything older than 1 month.

Let's see how small it gets with putting urgent on next page C2.<br><br><br>After 1 month of usage, my original AF1 list had about 500 open tasks, if I remember correctly, which eventually grew to over 1200 (and was still growing).

I'll try to track this and see what happens.  Until today, the page count kept growing and growing.  Today I moved through 4 pages and added only 1 - generally it's closer to the opposite - so this is good progress.  But moving through pages isn't enough -- real progress would be when the active page count starts to level off, or actually decrease.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim,<br><br>If DWM was working fine with 1600 tasks, how is it a problem that SF is still expanding with less than 250?<br><br>What DOES seem to be a problem is that you aren't getting through the list every day. So things which Mark would put in C1 as "later today" need to go in C2, slowing down the system. If this then means that you are invoking common sense rules all the time, I can understand your concern. As you have found, dismissal helps.<br><br>If you  have an 8 hour working day (HA!!) of which half is taken up by meetings, that gives you about 25 ten minute bursts of action.

<div class="content">Hi Seraphim,<br><br>although I sympathize (I'm having trouble getting through the list myself), I can't help thinking this problem should resolve itself when using the system a bit longer.  You wrote that you often have to enter C2-tasks a few pages ahead, because at the next page(s) C2 is full.  That means, once you manage to reach the end of the list and go back to the first page, you either have to do everything remaining in C1 (not a lot, you said, because you already did most on your first pass), or dismiss the lot. Either way, that's one page less, and this will happen for a lot of pages once you start again on the first page. And because your urgent C2-items will be entered further and further down the list (because your C2's are full :-), you're probably going to dismiss.<br><br>At least, that's how I hope it will work out in my case. I'm not processing more than 2 or 3 pages a day, which is too slow, but I hope that once I manage to speed things up (I'll try the suggestion to enter urgent C2-tasks on the next page instead of the current one!) dismissal will kick in.<br><br>I had a similar experience when I started to use AF1: initially I crawled through the list, but once I reached the point to dismiss pages, I happily dismissed page after page. I'm hoping it will work out similarly with SF3.</div>

The dog-related task has to be done more regularly, but the others if I do them once a week or so, I'm okay. I don't want them on some other checklist because they'll get glossed over. This is working for me. <br><br>I did all three of these during the day yesterday when I hit 'pick up yard' on the list (got on a roll out there). The other two items were a page or two back. I got to those pages last night. I couldn't do the yard type stuff at night. I could have left them for the next cycle through. But that leaves old pages open longer with just an item or two on them (that was the case with one of them...crossing it out and moving it ahead allowed me to close a page). <br><br>I'll probably still do whatever common-sense tells me is right for me and my list at the particular time that something like this occurs, but I'm trying to make sure that I consider the consequences that I may not have thought of.</div>

<div class="content">Malisa - <br><br>That's what I would do also.  If I come to a page and it has a recurring item that I've already finished for one reason or another, I cross it out and re-enter at the end of the list (or wait till it gets triggered again by an Outlook reminder).</div>

<div class="content">Might I point out that Rules exist to make sure the mechanics of a system are respected from one individual to the next. They are a way to describe an abstract concept in manageable thoughts. Thus the spirit of a rule is actually the system and how it is meant to move to achieve optimum performance. No matter how precise a rule is, you will never understand it if you do not understand the reason that drove the creation of the rule in the first place.<br><br>All Autofocus systems are like a gear. With the gear itself being the entire list and all the (I don't know the term in english) teeth being the equivalent of the pages. There are actually 2 different kinds of revolutions inside the system. The first one is obviously the cycling through a page. This makes you work on that stuff a lot but keeps you from going forward. You are stuck in 1st gear in a car or on a bike if you will. It is powerful and you can climb mountains but you won't go fast anywhere.<br><br>The second is the cycling through all the system. It takes more time to go through one iteration of the loop but the mileage on it is quite considerable. For long span projects, this use of the system is quite effective. It is equivalent to being in 5th gear on your car or 3rd speed on your bicycle.<br><br>Notice the gap?<br>If you want to go for the mileage, you have to get out of first gear.<br>Now Superfocus answered a crucial problem,... It's hard to go from 1st gear to 5th gear.<br><br>If you have say the 3rd gear of a car or the second speed of a bike, then the transition is easier and more automatic. Superfocus does this with the second column. It let's you bring an item forward with you to the next page (third type of loop). That loop has the power of the first kind of loop and the mileage of the second type of loop.<br><br>Seraphim, you are stuck in 1st gear, there is no other way to go faster then to shift gear! And I'm sorry to say that longer pages will only give you longer second columns, it will most probably cripple you more then help. Try 10 lines per page, you'll go through fast enough and won't put stuff C2 that much, and if you do, you'll only dismiss stuff (that's cool). That's at least what a friend of mine has tried recently and it works great...<br><br>Last thing...<br>Things you put in your list are your commitments. They change depending on situation and environment. If you have a big list and taking a cup of coffee is something important to you, the longer the list, the less often you will get to it. You can absolutely and reasonably have the commitment of taking 3 cups of coffee while you cycle your system once!</div>

This makes it easier to cycle through the pages.   The last page with the newest tasks is only 1-2 pages away, rather than 4-5 pages away.   This reduces the urge to put things in C2, since I'm more likely to get to them pretty soon anyway "in the normal process of working the system."<br><br>(2) C2 does not fill as quickly.  This reduces pressure to finish C1 tasks in one go -- which reduces the tendency of C1 tasks to "stand out".   With smaller pages, that pressure from C2 filling up is very strong, making it much more likely for C1 tasks to stand out, which slows down the overall progress.<br><br>(3) The stress on C2 from (1) and (2), above, is reduced, which means subsequent pages also have fewer C2 items to deal with.  <br><br>(4) Fewer C2 items means that you don't cycle each page as many times, which further reduces the number of C1 items that stand out, which further speeds up the cycling through the overall list.<br><br>I've only just begun using a notebook with longer pages, so I don't know how it will work out in practice, but the reasoning (inspired by Bob Pankratz's post at <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1424127" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1424127</a> ) makes sense to me.<br><br><br><<< Try 10 lines per page, you'll go through fast enough and won't put stuff C2 that much, and if you do, you'll only dismiss stuff (that's cool).

But that's not the ideal way for dismissal to happen.   Dismissal is more useful when it happens after repeated exposure to the task -- and failure to act despite the repeated exposure.   If your list is dominated by stuff that is "maybe I'd like to do this someday" kinds of tasks, then perhaps fast dismissal is OK.   But my list doesn't have a lot of that kind of task in it.<br><br><br><<< Things you put in your list are your commitments. >>><br><br>No, not really.  <br><br>It's a list of everything I feel I must do, should do, would like to do, or someday/maybe would like to do, or things I am not sure how important or urgent they are yet.  <br><br>It includes not only tasks but ideas to explore; notes from meetings that need more thought before action can be defined; etc.<br><br>Back in the AF1 days we often joked on the forum that you could put anything from "walk the dog" or "clip your nails" to "start a company" or "conquer the world", and the list would process it effectively.<br><br>Not everything in life is necessarily attached to a commitment.  Putting it on my list actually helps me decide whether or not it is something to which I should make a commitment.<br><br><br><<< If you have a big list and taking a cup of coffee is something important to you, the longer the list, the less often you will get to it.

Or perhaps I'd go when my coworkers stop by and ask if I'd like to walk down to the cafeteria for a coffee break.<br><br>If I were addicted to coffee, and trying to limit my intake, I'd be more likely to add it to Column 1 and try not to act on it unless it stood out -- but if it were just driving me crazy I'd add it in Column 2 and act on it when it stood out.</div>

If you cycle a page 15 times before going to the next, the exposure is just once.With 10 lines per pages, if you act on 1 item on each page on each pass, you will get much better exposure in my mind. And dismiss will happen not as often as you might imagine. We actually tried it at 5 lines per page for a week for him to get the feel of the mechanics and the flow of the system and then ramped it up a notch. The real benefit is that C2 is almost not used or just when REALLY needed.</div>

Often, nothing in C1 stands out when I first read through the page.  But something in C2 stands out.  Then I cycle through C1 and C2 again, and now, reading C1 for a second time this visit, some of the resistance has broken down, and one or two things in C1 stand out.  I keep cycling, and with each cycle, the repeated exposure does tend to decrease the resistance and increase the likelihood of something standing out.<br><br><br><<< With 10 lines per pages, if you act on 1 item on each page on each pass, you will get much better exposure in my mind. >>><br><br>I suppose this could work if you add a new rule, "Act on no more than 1 item in C1 during each visit to the page."

<div class="content">Seraphim if you want longer pages and this is just a suggestion mind you then its easy enough to do. All you have to do is to ignore the pages in your book and make a virtual page every time you finish the list and move back to the beginning by drawing a line across the page. So what happens basically is that you get a new page every time you pass through the list. From what I've heard from reaeding your posts that should give you a LOT longer pages. And its self adjusting because if you are moving very slowly that gives you a few long pages and if you are moving fast that gives you a lot of short pages so the end of the list is about the same distance away if you see what I mean. And you could use this with AF1 or with SF.</div>

<div class="content">Short answer:  I haven't had to invoke any "common sense" rules in a long time -- at least a couple of weeks.<br><br>Long answer:  See below.  :-)<br><br>So far, I decided to go back to ALL the original SF rules and follow them strictly.  (I was trying for a couple weeks to enter urgent items in C2 on the next page, to try to get the system to go faster; but I have stopped doing that, mostly.)<br><br>The only real change I implemented was to use a larger notebook.  This does seem to make progress through the book proceed more quickly, and helps prevent C2 overload.  (I miss being able to carry the notebook in my pocket, however.)<br><br>I did start dismissing more, but this hasn't really been a conscious effort.   It started happening because I realized that I could try to follow the SF rules strictly at all times -- even when I'm sick and would normally just cherry-pick a few things to do.   This realization somehow freed me to strictly follow the "standing out" rules at all times, and dismiss whenever the rules say to dismiss.   <br><br>I'm still having trouble "chasing the end of the list" and moving slowly -- but it's not too bad, not anywhere near as bad as it was with AF1 or AF4.  I've only got 11 active pages which is probably about 250 active tasks.   When I was this far into it with AF1/AF4, I already had at least 800 tasks.<br><br>Part of this is because SF is just better.   Part of it is that I've learned better habits as a result of using all of Mark's systems (thus increasing my brain power, as per Mark's recent blog post!).<br><br>To answer your question, "have you eliminated a lot of 'less then necessary' stuff" -- I think I put in just as much ideas and random thoughts and odds and ends as I always have.   Some of them get processed more quickly -- especially if they are rather large in scope and/or require creative energy -- I move those into Outlook reminders set for 3 months from now, since I am just too busy at work to deal with them right now and I don't even want to see them in SF.  <br><br>Anyway this is kind of long but I hope it answers your questions.  And I hope you are doing OK in Japan!!   :-)</div>

<div class="content">Hey, I'm glad this thread just bubbled to the top of the forum, where I am seeing it for the first time. I actually read the *entire* thing.<br><br>Seraphim, thank you for sharing so much of your experience in so much detail and being such a willing troubleshooting subject right out in public. I too am impressed at how well the dialog went and how constructive it has remained.<br><br>Though I have never had even close to 1200 tasks, my progression learning SF has been similar to yours, and it looks like you and I have similar personality types. Tweaks that I think of trying, you often have already tried and reported on. It is very encouraging to see that you are now following the rules strictly and finding the system more effective.<br><br>Today I realized that my "today list" has begun to harbor things that really ought to be in C1. This began as my pace through the list lagged, and I began to feel anxious about the pages I haven't seen in a while. So, I started to resist writing things in C1 if they are "kind of urgent," for fear they would disappear for too long. I am now realizing that this is a message from SF: "you are moving to slowly through the list (and going off-book too much!); put everything in the system, be more selective on each page, and work littler and more often."<br><br>I just finished moving these things back into C1, and I am going to let that anxiety affect my feeling of "ready to be done," hoping it will pull me through the list. If I'm so anxious about being stuck on this page that I'm not writing new items in C1, then I guess nothing on this page is really "ready to be done," eh?<br><br>That's a little tricky for me, because I tend to have a pretty warped sense of time, thinking that a thing will take ten minutes but then spending over an hour on it (ahem, it is nearly 1:30 am here as I write this). I can't expect any time management system to fix that for me automatically, but SF is the first to push me to take it seriously (that is, not blame it on "too much to do" or say, "well that's just how I am"); instead, I am really wanting to work on it now and feeling like the payoff will be worth it. I once had some success to this end with time boxing, so I will get my timer out again tomorrow.<br><br>Despite my struggles with C1/C2/etc., this is an example of why I am so happy with SF. SF's feedback is incredibly concrete and useful and constructive, much more so than other systems I have used. When things go wrong, I feel like I am actually learning something rather than simply failing, and the fix (i.e., being more selective on each page) is something I can visualize doing without undue pain or resistance.<br><br>Thank you to everyone who invested time in this thread.</div>

After a few weeks it did help to give me a better sense of time, and a greater sense of urgency in getting right into the new tasks and not dilly-dallying around it.  <br><br>It's not really a rule adjustment but it's a useful technique nonetheless.

<div class="content">Hi Seraphim<br><br>I just red your post and wish to answer about a major point. <br><br>I won't give any lesson. I am just a learner. But some events in my life gave my some good lessons I would share with you. May be it will help you and some others and I received so much from many of you that it's the less  I could do. <br><br>You seems "over committed'<br><br>There could be 2 reason one because your boss want to slave you more and more, second because you'r a serious man and so you want to do your best. <br><br>Let me tell you a story. 5 years ago I was working in a big French assurance company and did my best for my job. I worked harder and harder. Did my best, took all commitments possible and finally i was fired not because I was inefficient but because I needed too much for others. It was hard for me but I decided to create my own company and since I did, it is a success. But this time the rules were said by myself then they were more difficult to realize. The situation began little by little very hard to control. Then I discovered GTD and later MF site. I thought this was the end of my problem. But no. <br><br>Anyway with the help of all what I read here and everywhere I now understand 2 or 3  things it's not much and it's the common sense but I am going to share it with you. <br><br>1. You are not Superman. Do your best but not more<br>2. Think to you first and after to others. What could you do without health ? You won't be able to serve others. Then be good and love you first. Then you will be able to give to other and love them. <br>3. SF, GTD are systems. There are interesting but no enough. You must think first to the nature of your work and find solution to make others working for you. I red somewhere that someone dismissed the same tasks all the time in SF. He suddenly realized that he Hated this activity. So he delegated it to a friend who loved it and it was a success. We are not good in everything, accept it and try to give and receive from others. <br>4. Remember Pareto 80 % of the success is done with 20% of action. So you spend 80% of your time doing nothing useful but you must do it if you want to reach the 20%. But may be you can do better. I recently realized that there are 2 kinds of task actionable and not actionable. I wrote some threads about this. (ie MF site - context GTD).  I put all my actionable tasks on SF and the Non actionable task in Omnifocus it's much better. One time I will spend 80% of my time on the 20% and will increase my success. <br>5. Remember the golden rule choosing is trashing. Use Dismiss if you can't do something there is a raison. Dismiss too everywhere. Trash a lot it's your best friend after your wife and your dog. LOL. If you suddenly die what will be left ? Nothing. When I realized that I changed my life and my behavior with others. I now live a rich life even I have like others many difficulties but I have the real feeling of living. Doing many tasks sometime is only a way to forget our own weakness among the universe.<br><br>So carefully choose your tasks, don't let people decide for you, think regularly about what you are and where you want to go, and try to make the best choice for controlling your life and not being controlled by it and see it in perspective. <br><br>The rule of life is quiet unfair. You know you'r here but no for how long. <br>Nobody knows what time is left.<br><br>So live your life, do the wright things and even if you die at 150 years old spent each day as it would be the last and make the right choice in every domains.</div>

<div class="content"><<The Pomodoro rule tweak for SF ...<br>Have fun (or go nuts)!>><br><br>Alan, I think it will be "go nuts" for me!<br>I do like timers, though for me their main value comes by insulating me from the clock. If I have four hours before I need to pick up my son, for example, I may set the timer for two and dive into something. I can *completely* forget about time, because the timer is watching my back, and I know I'll have plenty of time left to deal with whatever else is on my list.<br><br>My brief Pomodoro experiment was excruciating, mostly due to the tiny 25 minute window. The timer too often rang when I was really getting something done and had no need to stop, so it seemed counterproductive. But I could imagine a more relaxed version of Pomodoro working for me. It would definitely have longer blocks (45 minutes at least!) and would be less rigid about counting them up.</div>

<div class="content">I'm trying a new experiment - starting a timer for the PAGE, not for the task.  <br><br>If I have 13 pages and about 10 hours per day of time working the list, that gives about 45 minutes per page (MAX) to get through the whole list once/day.   <br><br>I just started doing this today and it's been pretty weird -- I am getting through the pages MUCH faster than usual, and generally in 20 minutes or less.  I also find that I naturally gravitate toward the C2 tasks and knock most of them out quickly, then act on a few C1 tasks, then linger on any remaining C2 tasks as long as I want.   <br><br>I like this MUCH better than using Pomodoro on a per-task basis.   That never worked for me at all.<br><br>It's just the first day that I'm doing this, but since it's working so well and seemed to be relevant, I thought I'd mention it...</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark - <br><br>Wow, so many interesting old discussions. Fascinating how the themes recur in different forms.<br><br>I don't remember how that experiment played out in the end. But I am finding myself doing something similar with my AF4R experiment. I have my three page types -- New, Unfinished, and Recurring. There are days when I find myself getting pulled into one category of tasks, and the other categories are neglected. For example, I may have a lot of Unfinished tasks, and I might inadvertently focus on them exclusively, with the result that I fall behind on my inboxes, or neglect urgent tasks on my New list.<br><br>So I have been trying the following -- <br>-- I set a time limit (maybe 30-60 minutes) to get through whatever category of pages I am working on. <br>-- I do an FV-style task selection within those pages, and try to pace my work so that I get all the selected tasks completed within the time limit.<br>-- After the time expires, I stop and move on to the next page type.<br><br>For example, I might start the day with 30 minutes dedicated to the Unfinished tasks, and select three of those tasks to work on. When the timer is done, I move on to the New tasks, and set the timer again. Then move on to the Recurring tasks, and set the timer again.<br><br>This helps to get things moving and give an appropriate balance to the different kinds of tasks. It gives me a good sense of the work of the day. <br><br>I don't always use the timer. After I have a good pace and a good sense of what I want to get done that day, I stop using the timer.</div>
