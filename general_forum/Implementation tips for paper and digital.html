<div class="content">=== A simple paper tip ===<br><br>Although I've chosen to play AF digital, here is a straightforward tip to mark active pages I've used in the past :<br><br>a) In many datebooks you can tear the down right corner to open the book right to the current page : this makes an easy tip to open AF notebook to the last page when you want to jot a new thought.<br><br>b) Here my other tip : there is an other corner you can tear : upper right ! Tear it when the page is "closed", ie. all items are either done, either rejected, either dismissed. So when you've come to last page, you cycle back to the first past page still active : the first with upper corner not teared.<br><br>(thought of that when I got my page 2 closed, whilst page 1 still had a dozen active items)<br><br>=== My Digital tips ===<br><br>I've choosen to stay digital because of :<br>* Cleanliness and order (I am very bad to keep papers clean and in good order in the long run)<br>* copy (eventually import from a mail or doc, export ...)<br>* search / filter (answer which tasks have I recorded for that person or that project )<br>* Tagging (I manage to put keywords like who for, what for, ... ) in the item label to ease reviewes or searches<br>* Notes (eventually pasted clip of a paragraph that was the source of my thought, detail not to forget that came to mind during slow pace reading, stored link to a doc or an email, etc)<br><br>I soon dissmissed desktop, laptop and even my Tablet (1), and settled to my old pda (still a Palm), always at hand wherever I am on which I am already trained to write easily. Which app then ?  I soon rejected outliners, Word, Excel or databases, and simply choosed to work with ... memos.<br><br>--- Memos for AF ---<br><br>I found most important to keep the AF "Page" concept, and to mimic a paper notebook :<br><br>* I do not use a memo as an AF page, but as an AF item, in the category "Autofocus".<br>* Pages are screen displays of "Autofocus" list of memos (with my font setting it makes 20 items a screen).<br><br>* I put dividers bottom of each screen (a blue dotted line, ie an empty memo which title is a dotted line, set to display in blue). That's how I new my remaining items on page 2 were to be dismissed.<br><br>* I never delete items (neither reorder) , but use color coding (two taps) to mark rejected (yellow pale), done (light gray), dismissed (bright orange). Outstandings are normal black.<br><br>* When an item stands out, I drag a green dotted line (another divider memo) just above it to bookmark the position. Back to pda, when I press memo button, it opens where I left : time to enter what's left to do (new memos are appended at the end of the list) and resume my slow pace reading down the current "page".<br><br>* If an item becomes an exception (urgency), I set it red  and connect it to datebook (alarm). My current rule of thumb is to never have more than 3 exceptions a day, and not to let them live more than the day : if not done, then it should be either rejected (to late !) either restated as a new item (emergency action ?).<br><br>Keep it simple : most of my memos - currently 61 since I started anew with AF - are empty (but the title !). But for about six of them I'm happy to have a place for notes where to add a detail, store an exact wording, insert a due date, or a not before date, etc).<br><br>For now, I can just say I feel at ease with this organisation and AF process. I feel motivated to proceed as is... <br>... until I bump in one of my procrastinative blocks ?<br><br>(1) Another Win soft that seems excellent (clean, simple and straightforward) for digital AF is Tudumo</div>

<div class="content">Jacques, great suggestions! <br><br>Please tell us how you do the colors? As far as I remember, the stock memopad can't use colors. I looked into MemoLeaf, but its coloring seems to be linked to the memo category, which wouldn't work with your system, as I understand it. <br><br>And how well does this system play with sync, e.g. to Outlook?</div>

<div class="content">Alex, <br>(following are settings for Palm users only)<br>--------------------------------<br>I use PsMemo (free, from Japan) for memos : <br>color titles, drag, many sortings (do not use with AF to keep writing order !), copy titles, clone memos, incremental search on titles or on contents, search/replace, date and time stamp, activable links (url, or send content to mail or sms), 8 font sizes, creation and last edited date, eeeh, what do I forget ?<br>I use small bold font that gives very readable 23 lines display on a 320x480 Tx.<br><a href="http://jove21.com/palm/palmware/psmemo/?ex-lang=en" rel="nofollow">http://jove21.com/palm/palmware/psmemo/?ex-lang=en</a><br>Sembe, the author has made also PsLink (free, which sits in Palm Prefs), that let you [link] memos, to or from Datebook, etc.<br><br>If you're at ease writing on Palm, this combo makes a very handy solution.<br><br>I don't use Outlook (I work since 92 !!! with Above&Beyond), but as PsMemo uses stock memopad database, it should sync without any problem if you have set your Palm synching so.<br><br>Mail me for details out of this forum if you wish further Palm implementation details :)</div>

<div class="content">Bonsoir Christine,<br><br>You can easily play Autofocus with A&B : <br>* Use  (badly named) priority list so :<br> #A : asaps and other exceptions<br> #B to #T (or further !) for Autofocus pages<br>(last letters for dismissed, someday maybes, things to review once a year...)<br>* rightclick  to color code items status ...<br><br>* Eventually : entry form to set à due dates, earliest date, open days or hours....<br>* Use datebook as a digital tickler<br><br>* Even have it make a simulation of future overloading (so to improve your decisions decisions when back in AF process)<br><br>... but never be the slave of proposed "optimised" schedules done by the computer !!<br><br>All your time management can be managed thru this single app !<br>... but not on a pocket computer :(<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacques<br><br>Thanks for that - I used to use A&B extensively.  It was great for scheduling my day and for keeping track of billable time.  I haven't used it for a while but it would be good to look at it again for my scheduling.  Will add that review to my list :-)</div>

<div class="content">A further paper tip: <br><br>Use a paper clip as a bookmark. One can use more than one if for example you want to quickly get to the last open page for a new entry but otherwise want to return to the page you are currently working on. Different colours and/or positions are useful.</div>

<div class="content">Does anybody have some tricks how to use different AF-notebooks within a single physical book? E.g one for home, one for office, maybe some more. How can you then easily find where to write new items and where you are currently working. Thanks for sharing your ideas.<br>Wolfgang</div>

<div class="content">Christine,<br><br>I'd be interested to hear if you get OneNote to sync with OneNote mobile.  I have a lot of things in OneNote that I'd like to see on my phone.  My experience so far is that:<br><br>- OneNote will sync from phone to PC but not vice versa (though people claim they have found a way to do that and someone even has a powertoy to help the process.<br><br>- The "sync" is more like a "copy".  The entire mobile database syncs to only a single book.<br><br>- OneNote mobile does not have the structure that makes it so useful on the PC.<br><br>If this is getting outside of the focus of the group here, I'd be happy to take it to private  email.</div>

<div class="content">Wowi--<br><br>I have 3 notebooks. One for stuff I can only do at home, one for stuff I can only do at work, and one for stuff I can do at any computer. the "Any" list is the largest; home and work are more static. <br><br>Because home and work tend to be shorter lists, I put them both on the same page (with the dynamic division between them suggested somewhere in the forum)--home at the top, work at the bottom. The Any list starts at the beginning of the notebook and works ahead; the Work/Home lists start at the back of the notebook and work forward. I mark the last page for each list with "page points" (cute little metal bookmarks from Levenger) to make it easy to find when adding new tasks. I use another one on the page I'm currently working on, with the "point" pointing right at the task I'm on. (Paper clips or sticky notes or whatever would work just as well; I just happened to have some of the points lying around.) <br><br>I have about 10 active pages currently, so it's not all that tough to figure out where I am, even without marking it; it's also usually very clear which list I should be focusing on at any moment. (ie, I'm at work: look at the work list! I'm on break at work: look at the Any list.)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike<br><br>Thanks for the info.  I've checked out OneNote Mobile online and will certainly add it to my list to look at how it works on my phone.  I don't tend to use my phone apps a great deal - I tend to avoid mobiles where possible as they give me earache (even with an earpiece) but my current phone a Treo has excellent handsfree so that is no excuse now.  Will probably not check it out in detail immediately (unless AF tells me to of course!) but will let you know how I get on when I do.  Have tasked a reminder!  Will be happy to discuss over private mail if it gets technical rather than have a bunch of people running for the hills every time OneNote is mentioned. :-)</div>

<div class="content">To achieve something similar to Geoff's paper clip bookmarking, I use post-it index flags in different colors to mark the first active page, end of list and current working position (I'm not sure this hasn't been suggested by someone else, though). <br><br>It's not as useful for turning pages more easily, but they mark the respective pages even more obviously and are a little easier to apply than paper clips.<br><br>-- <br>Alex</div>

<div class="content">Jacques: <br><br>In the meantime, I downloaded PsMemo and tried it with my trusty old Palm m515 (!), but nowhere I could find an option to colorize individual memos. <br>Could you please give me some more instructions?<br><br>I can't find out how to send you an email, but I left a message on your homepage (?). <br>Is avm.online.fr still your site or is it/has it always been the site of Teri Pitman?

<div class="content">Hi Alex,<br><br>I've answerred your post january 18, both on my site and by a mail to the email you left !<br>As it is short, I just copy it here :<br><br>"Color :<br>In list view : Menu Record/Set title color<br>You can also set a popup menu that pops when you tap and hold on a memo title : last menu item is "Title color" (setup in : Options/Prefs/List view )<br><br>Or, also (maybe the fastest) in a memo : button <i> in the lower button bar : "Title" opens the color palette !<br><br>BTW : With standard memopad you could also keep my dividers idea, but use four categories instead of colors3<br><br>Thanks vonpng for giving PsMemo url.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-01-20 21:47</div>
<div class="content">Thank you, Jacques, for the additional instructions, and you, vonpmg, for the hint regarding the latest nightly. Indeed, I had already noticed the latest nightly but usually stick with 'final' resp. 'stable' releases. So I missed that.<br><br>But now that I tried it, this method looks too cumbersome to me, because PsMemo will send you directly to the memo after you select one in the list with a click. And you'll have to pick the color from a huge palette. <br>I'm thinking about asking Paul Nevai (who seems to be a nice guy from the contact I had with him some time ago) if he's still developing pedit and in case he is, whether he's willing to make some changes which would go well with AF. However, now that the Palm OS is officially dead, I doubt it.<br><br>Another problem I have is that my Palm is low-res, and will only show 10 items at a time on one screen. And I don't feel like buying a new one, because, well, the Palm OS is dead, did I already say that?<br><br>OTOH, Jacques, your idea for the standard memopad will only work if you don't use memos for anything else and use only AF categories, since you can only have one category shown, or all of them. Having other categories would completely dilute the system (hmm, would it?). To me, this seems too much of a sacrifice of functionality. I have lots of other memos. <br><br>It's a pity the stock todo app can't be used with AF. I can find no way to sort other than by priority, due date or category. And 15 categories max don't seem to be appropriate to use them as 'pages'. But now that I think of it... <br><br>All of this touches a major problem I have with the paper vs. digital question: Yes, it's easy to implement AF only with paper. But it seems to work best with only one 'book' and I don't feel like carrying around a A5 (or even A4) notebook, pad or binder. <br>And given that I already carry around a digital device (for calendar, address book and lots of other uses), I'd like to use only one device. But then, I haven't yet found something that's really usable on a PDA/smartphone or at least syncs nicely with my PC at work and my Mac at home. I can't say how trying all those Mac apps made me pull my hair out - Outlook on the PC solves the problem nicely, but on a Mac - no way (GTD all over the place, but no program will group or at least sort by creation date, and sync in a reasonable way; Entourage's and iCal's task sections are especially anemic compared to Outlook).</div>

<div class="content">Alex,<br><br>(nb: on my Tx I can color or drag memos without opening them...)<br><br>If you still keep the idea of using your dear old Palm for AF so to be able to pick an items which stands out and is actionable where you are, or to enter a thought wherever you are you could play it like this: <br><br>"Page" divider memo : "=========" (fi every two screens)<br>Where you are bookmark : "    myCurrentStandingOut" (a tab begin of line to indent)<br>Prefix your done with "XXXmyDoneItem", your dismissed with "oooMyDissmissedItem", and trash, or set another category for done items.<br>Ought to be visual enough...<br><br>Just as an idea (I never praticed that :)</div>

<div class="content">Mike<br><br>re One Note Mobile - I've now installed it on my Palm Treo but see that it does only sync to it's own "Notebook".  I may well use it just to jot down notes on the move but don't think I will use it with AF - it would not be sufficiently user friendly for me to warrant the added complication.  Thanks very much (and Jon B) for the pointers though - I am sure I will find the mobile app really useful in general, just not for AF!</div>

<div class="content">I'll second the recommendation for multi-colo[u]red pens. Bic sells a ubiquitous 4-in-1 ballpoint, but I've upgraded to a nicer 3-in-1 gel ink pen from Zebra. Currently I write "fun" tasks in green, "chores" in blue, and "hard stuff" in red. <br><br>This has a couple of benefits:<br> - each page is much more visually *interesting* than plain black-on-white ink<br> - I can tell at a glance whether I'm slacking off (lots of green checkmarks) or buckling down (lots of red)</div>
