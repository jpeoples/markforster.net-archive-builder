<div class="content">After nearly nine years of successfully implementing Do it Tomorrow (!! - my first impressions were back here: <a href="http://www.joshuanewman.com/2007/11/do_it_tomorrow/)," target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.joshuanewman.com/2007/11/do_it_tomorrow/),</a> I decided to trust the Genius of Forster and test out a no-list approach.<br><br>This first week has been both a great success (I managed to knock out a bunch of dreaded stuff I'd been too long ignoring) and fairly terrifying (less due to fear of an empty list, and more to the vaguely unmoored feeling of mapping things as I go, rather than relying on firmly pre-structured plans).<br><br>On balance, it's been an improvement; enough so that I'm going to keep the experiment going.<br><br>I do, however, have one open question.<br><br>Currently, I address the vast majority of my work by coming up with the next task from scratch (or, occasionally, aided by the prompt of a list of my broader commitments).  For a small number of tasks, I've been using my calendar to queue date-dependent actions.<br><br>But I'm semi-frequently struck by small tasks that are neither immediately actionable nor date-dependent.  (This morning, for example, I realized I need to head to the Verizon store to replace the SIM chip in an older iPad.  That's not due on a specific date, though also something I'm unlikely to find time for today.)<br><br>So, in short, what do I do with those tasks?  Ignore them for the moment, and hope they'll pop back to mind when the time is right?  Schedule them for a future date, as a reminder to at least consider doing them then?  Or capture them in some sort of 'possible future tasks' list (which, I fear, might easily become an everything list, and derail my no-list life entirely)?<br><br>Ideas much appreciated!</div>

<div class="content">Joshua:<br><br>Thanks for sharing your experiences so far - which are similar to mine.<br><br>Personally I keep a shopping list for minor items which are more or less independent of anything else. Sometimes they are things which require physically going to buy them - more often just stuff I can buy on Amazon, etc. <br><br>Normally I would clear them as a batch.</div>

<div class="content">I would probably find I day I know I have free to run errands and put it on a calendar.  However, I am most impressed with you sticking with a system for 9 years, especially in light of the many other systems we have discussed over the years.<br><br>Gerry</div>
