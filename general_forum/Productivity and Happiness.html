<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">In these challenging times, I have found myself thinking that I need a break from my routines and schedule. I will be happier if I don’t do my regular writing times and spend extra time on social media instead, I’ve thought. So I have skipped key parts of my routine quite often these past few months.<br><br>But for the last 12 weeks I have had a very consistent, intense workout routine. I feel fantastic about my current level of fitness. This morning, though, I considered skipping or doing an easier workout. I immediately rejected the idea because I knew at the end of the day, I wouldn’t be happier. I would be disappointed in myself and in danger of returning to my old fitness routine that had me feeling sluggish and lax. I wasn’t willing to give up the true happiness I have in my new fitness routine. So I did my workout and felt great.<br><br>Then it hit me. I have been blowing off writing times and other important parts of my routine like chores to be happier, when the effect has been the opposite. I have felt depressed and less confident. I feel anxious about deadlines and my business.<br><br>This is not to say that it’s never okay for me to take a day off from a workout or writing. I don’t have a problem doing that. But happiness, for me, doesn’t come from blowing off my routines. All of my best, non-vacation days have been days when I’ve worked out, written something on my current project, processed my email, and cleaned my house according to a reasonable routine. And my worst days have been those where I’ve started scrolling social media on my phone right from bed, justifying it as needing to do what makes me happy. <br><br>Now when I consider blowing off an important part of my routine, I will think about how I’ll feel at the end of the day. I will think about what a truly happy and productive day looks like for me. I hope this is helpful to someone else.</div>

<div class="content">Mark, I love that as a question. Thanks! I will be working my backlog list in Reverse AF2 style. I’m going to refresh my memory on FVP.</div>
