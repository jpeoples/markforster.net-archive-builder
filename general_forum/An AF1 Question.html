<div class="content">Mark (and others)<br><br>Have you tried eliminating Step 1*, and beginning with Step 2**? If I recall, Step 1 rarely primed my pump, only increased my anxiety. So by the time I'd start Step 2, things wouldn't jump out at me because I was too revved up - good and bad - with I just saw on one full pass of the page. Anyone else experience this? <br><br>In your opinion/experience, what is the drawback of eliminating Step 1? <br><br>*Read quickly through all the items on the page without taking action on any of them.<br>**Go through the page more slowly looking at the items in order until one stands out for you.</div>

<div class="content">avrum:<br><br>The simple answer is that if Step 1 hinders you more than helps you, then don't use it. <br><br>The reason I put in Step 1 was so that you get an idea of what is on a page before starting to work on it. That (in theory at least) helps your mind to choose subconsciously the right tasks to stand out.<br><br>I also find it quite relaxing to scan a page knowing that I am not expected to choose anything at this stage. It sort of gives me a chance to draw my breath before getting back into the fray.<br><br>But if it has the opposite effect on you, then there is no need whatsoever to include it.</div>

<div class="content">Not sure if I have a good answer, but wanted to say you aren't alone, and that I had the same experience.  <br><br>I remember that feeling of anxiety.  Sometimes I would feel that way when reading through the page, and seeing how many things on that page were really pressing, and not sure how I could get them all done.  It would be a little paralyzing, or make me skittish.  I'd start a task that stood out, but then jump quickly to another, then go do some displacement activity like checking email, to get away from the sense of anxiety.   Maybe it would have been better just to dismiss the whole page and move on.   Or go for a 15-minute walk to clear my mind, then move on to Step 2.   <br><br>But on the other hand, I remember that when I tried skipping step 1, it gave me a feeling of myopia - I only had visibility into one task at a time, and didn't have a good sense of the full contents of my list.  Reading through the items on the page helped preserve a better sense of the whole picture.   <br><br>In retrospect, I think the feeling of myopia from skipping Step 1 was worse than the occasional feeling of anxiety when performing Step 1.   Performing Step 1 would usually give me a sense of calm and perspective, like Mark describes, and I think it's worth the tradeoff of the times when it produces anxiety.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br>I think my response to the question about anxiety which you raise would be the same as I gave to avrum on another thread:<br><br>"My own experience with AF1 is that everything works fine as long as I just follow the system. The problems come when for one reason or another I feel I want to change things. So for instance I come to a page which contains a lot of tasks I really don't want to do. The result is that I can't face even starting on the page. Result: I go off and try another system - or stop working altogether.<br><br>"What I should have done of course was simply calmly scan down the page item by item according to the rules and if something stood out I should have worked on it and if nothing stood out I should have dismissed the entire page, again according to the rules.<br><br>"Nothing difficult about that - the system would still be intact and my resistance to the page would have been irrelevant."<br><br>We used to sum that up with the phrase "Trust the system!"</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br><<Reading through the items on the page helped preserve a better sense of the whole picture>><br><br>Well - it's only a page, right? I mean, the contents that make up each page in AF 1 are just a hodge podge of unrelated and related stuff. <br><br><<I think it's worth the tradeoff of the times when it produces anxiety>><br><br>To my mind, if it interferes with one's intuition re: "standing out" - the most compelling attribute of AF 1 imho, than all bets are off. <br><br>Anyway, thanks for taking the time to answer my question.</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br><<That (in theory at least) helps your mind to choose subconsciously the right tasks to stand out.<br>>><br><br>Hm, well that's a compelling reason, and one that I didn't know about when using AF 1.</div>

<div class="content"><<A quick read through the page allows your mind to start processing the items without pressure>><br><br>Thanks for this. I recall these instructions, but never made the connection between "processing the items without pressure" and the "standing out" process. Probably because I was too ramped up about what I had to do, didn't want to do and how much I had to do.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim, you said:<br>"I remember that feeling of anxiety. Sometimes I would feel that way when reading through the page, and seeing how many things on that page were really pressing, and not sure how I could get them all done .......... Maybe it would have been better just to dismiss the whole page and move on."<br><br>I was wondering why you would consider dismissing the whole page and moving on, when there were many things on that page that were really pressing.  I'd never be able to dismiss that sort of task -  I would only dismiss a task if it weren't pressing.<br><br>Maybe I've misunderstood.</div>

<div class="content">A few things to remember when faced with a page that is causing anxiety or resistance:<br><br>1) You only have to work on one task on the page to avoid dismissal.<br><br>2) You don't have to work more than a bit on the tasks you select.<br><br>3) Tasks you only work on for a bit are moved to the end of the list, so you can work on them multiple times in quick succession.<br><br>4) If a task gets really pressing then you can deal with it under the "If it needs doing now, then do it" rule.<br><br>Remember that original Autofocus never *forces* you to do anything.<br><br>Trust the system!</div>

In fact, to me it feels rather the opposite of "standing out".  To me, that "standing out" feeling is more of a calm feeling of assent or assurance that yes, this task needs doing, this is what I need to do next.  It's kind of like a "flow" feeling -- this is the task just naturally seems to be "next".  <br><br>I've been reading ‎Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's original book on Flow lately.  His main thesis looks at two vectors:  capability of the individual, and the challenge of the task -- and says the ideal state is when these two vectors are evenly matched.  When the task is BEYOND our capability, we feel anxiety and overwhelm and can't get into a flow state.   When the task is BELOW our ability, and we're not exercising our capabilities to their full potential, we feel boredom and monotony, and also can't get into a flow state.   The ideal state lies somewhere between, where we are feeling adequately challenged but not overwhelmed.   When presented with a project or a series of tasks that gives us a good challenge but doesn't overwhelm, we can stay fully engaged for a long period of time, and get into a "flow" state of mind.<br><br>Autofocus and its "standing out" rule really help to find the right balance of tasks that keeps a person in that flow state, depending on one's current state of mind and energy, and the list of tasks one is facing.   <br><br>So, if I am presented with a page that does nothing but produce anxiety, I could try to slog through it, and lower my criteria for "standing out" to "whatever seems most pressing" instead of "whatever feels ready to be done".  Or I could just dismiss the lot of it, and find another task somewhere else in the list that feels more "ready".   I could come back later in the day or week to those dismissed tasks, and re-enter them as needed, when I'm in a better mental place to attack them.  <br><br>Anyway, that's what I had in mind...   "Trust the system..."</div>

I could imagine how that might be helpful sometimes, but honestly it just seems over-dramatic.  :-)   I think I'd rather just dismiss the page.  LOL!</div>

The question is not whether a page produces anxiety, but whether any of the individual tasks on it stand out or not. In other words what you feel about the page *as a whole* is irrelevant to the working of the system.</div>
