<div class="content">I just noticed something today that I never experienced with AF4: Fear.  Specifically, with DWM there are tasks that are advancing to the expiry date, and I have a good number of them that are in danger of falling off.  My instinctual reaction is to just ignore the list entirely rather than face this fear.<br><br>Obviously this is the wrong approach.  In fact, the ticking clock means things will just get worse if I ignore the list.  But with AF4 the issue didn't come up.  I always enjoyed looking at the list and never worried about expiry or dismissal.<br><br>This seems to be inherent to to DWM.  As long as you are ahead of the game, it's no problem.  But if you are behind, it can be a big problem.</div>

<div class="content">I know what you mean, but OTOH I'm not sure that it's any different that AF1 (AF3?) where the entire page is dismissed because none of the tasks stand out. And don't forget that you can save an item by working on it and then re-writing it on the +7 page.</div>

<div class="content">The difference: in AF4, you only had to do one thing to save the page.  In DWM you must do everything, and soon.</div>

<div class="content">oh. I never tried AF4, I did AF1 and 2. The dismiss 'whole page' in DWM is similar to AF1 so for me, there's not much difference.</div>

<div class="content">Alan,<br><br>This week I was hit with major, urgent situations. There were two days of heavy snow and a third day with no internet connection. So, I went from feeling very comfortable that I would easily meet all my expiration dates to feeling the fear.<br><br>I have tried using expiration dates before. I didn't feel the fear and I didn't get much done. The expiration dates would come . . . and then go. And I wouldn't lift a finger to do anything.<br><br>I really believe that DWM is going to make me incredibly disciplined, and it is this fear that is going to do it. In the past, if I had a day like the one I had this week where I only had 30 minutes discretionary time, there was no increased feeling of urgency. I just would get everything else done a day later. This time, the urgency was palpable.<br><br>What really worries me now is what will happen when I hit my first 1-month tasks. Right now, I am just barely staying current, and the only things on my list are the 1-week tasks. DWM is the the highest manifestation, so far, of DIT. I am finally getting a visceral sense of what 1-day's work is. I am getting a sense of what it means to take on too much. I haven't taken on too much yet, but I am approaching it. <br><br>I think the fear is a sign that I have overextended myself. I am learning from the fear. I am learning exactly how much I can do and how much is too much. I am already much more conscious of how I am spending my time. And that means that I am confronting some difficult questions of whether the way I allocate my time is something that I am happy with.</div>

<div class="content">A couple of comments:<br><br>All your tasks are "current" and on your list, even your one-month tasks.  You should be cycling through the whole list, not just 7 days of it.<br><br>I'm not sure what Mark would say, but if you are forced off-list for a day, scheduled or otherwise, I think it is appropriate to renumber your list by a day.  The explanation is here:<br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1004461#post1008700" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1004461#post1008700</a> <br><br>I know I am overextended and am a bit worried myself about what will happen when things have to get left undone.  I am still a few days away, but late next week may become a challenge for me!</div>

<div class="content">I have been very happy with AF2 thus far. The positive motivation to delete pages is very powerful for me, thus I am pressured to work on tasks to keep them moving forward. But I have to admit that sometimes old tasks stay around longer than they should. And  sometimes I feel like I do just enough work on a task to re-enter it but not enough to really activate and finish it. Maybe this is where the fear factor of DWM could come in handy. So I will probably try it out in the next few days and see what happens.</div>

<div class="content">For the first time since I started DWM I have a task that is about to expire tomorrow. Just one. Ii will see if it gets activated or shredded by the wheel of time. <br>I guess it may be activated since this is something I want to do at list a little but It is something without any direct reward and maybe annoying to do, and would ask to do more annoying task after it.</div>

<div class="content">"I guess it may be activated since this is something I want to do at list a little but It is something without any direct reward and maybe annoying to do, and would ask to do more annoying task after it."<br><br>But isn't that the beauty of the system? If you have time to sit here and write about how you may or may not choose to work on your task, you surely have the time to actually begin it! But the system (potentaion name: The System) make you honestly asses the value of that task.<br><br>Presumably you've had 30 days to think about doing it. Now, with 24 hours to go, you're still prevaricating. <br><br>So it's not really The Wheels of Time that do the shredding. The Wheels of Time merely power the shredding machine that is Your Choice.</div>

<div class="content">Hi all<br>I'm at times more like isd.  Heck, I'm the lady who attached $500 on the page with the threat of failure equals my money being tossed into a dog poop bag to get myself to break past a huge resistance barrier!  This isn't my M.O all the time but it does happen!  The resistance created might be a choice in actuality but it's not my only choice/desire.  I won't even factor in illness or pain.  I don't know where the resistance comes from when it's that powerful, but I feel like I'm in battle against it!  *blush*  Why else would I take such drastic measures if I wasn't desperate to win against the resistance.  And truth be told.........my inner dialog sounded quitie similar to what isd said about fearing the avalanche effect of even starting the month old task.<br>Isd, you're NOT alone!  I, too, have to fight really hard against resistance at times.........pssst...and I'll bet my house deed that there's more out there wrestling the same thoughts!  I do manage to stay in pace with my important work..........but........it's NOT because I'm always such an excellent choice maker!  *blush*  Sometimes carrying out the better choice is a struggle for me..........and millions of others!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">So, the effect is, if I think of something to do, I have a whole month before I actually have to do anything about it. But once I actually start on something, whether it's on Day 30 or Day 1, I can't put it aside for more than a week. Meaning, among other things, that there's a subtle pressure not to get started on something if I'm not really committed to it. Is that a good thing, or a bad thing, I wonder....</div>

<div class="content">My concern is that fear isn't the best long-term motivator, especially in this context. The first time you figure out that you can take a task that is supposed to be "dismissed" and re-enter it or do it anyway without penalty, your fear and thus your motivation will be weakened. If Mark were personally policing your process, the fear might be more effective. ;-) With enough opportunities to breach the rules without consequence, you will start tinkering with DWM or looking for another approach altogether. <br><br>My advice is to seek out reward-based motivation. So attempt to complete or delete all tasks by their "due date" for a set period and then brag about it here. Or give yourself a reward for doing so each month. Or really knuckle down and make clearing all of your tasks before their due date a habit. Do it every day whether you want to or not until you can't stand NOT doing it. This is how I made flossing my teeth a habit. Fear that I would develop gum disease or be yelled at by my hygienist (I was repeatedly) didn't do it for me. I just made myself floss and now I HAVE to. A positive change made--no fear required.</div>

<div class="content">>The first time you figure out that you can take a task that is supposed to be "dismissed" and re-enter it or do it anyway without penalty, your fear and thus your motivation will be weakened<br><br>But that's not just related to DWM - the same comment could apply to AF1-4, or DIT etc. Besides, if you do dismiss today, I don't think it's against the rules to add a task "review dismissed items' on today+30 and resurrect the dismissed items. Of course, doing that over & over & over... why aren't you just doing the task?<br><br>I have 2 items 'due' today. One I'm working on now, the other I'm not sure yet if I'll get it to today or not. And if not, I'll dismiss it today, and tomorrow when I think of it again, because it does need to be done,  I'll add to the Mar 15 page - all within the DWM rules. OTOH, I had a couple of days that went off-list unexpectedly this week, so i guess in theory I could re-date the page until tomorrow but I'm not sure why, that doesn't feel right. <br><br>The only thing about the dismissing/re-adding that might not be within the rules is dismissing at the end of the day instead of first thing this morning, but it makes more sense to me to dismiss at the end of the day instead of the beginning.</div>

<div class="content">I'm not inclined to disagree with your statement Avrum.  However, I've been reading "Face Your Fear" by Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, who is strongly in disagreement with your perspective.  Allow me a few quotes for discussion sake:<br><br>"Fear has no redeeming qualities.  Period."  "The moment you fear something, you give it power over you."  "Fear can be a superbly motivating factor in life, and it undoubtedly serves as one of the principle engines of human advance....  Yet even at its best, fear cannot be affirmative, only defensive.  It has you running, not to any set destination but rather running from something...."  "Don't run away from your fears, but find something to run toward - even if the ultimate result appears to be the same."<br><br>There's a couple hundred pages more.  Regarding motivation, essentially he's saying if carrots aren't motivating enough, find tastier food to work towards, and get rid of the sticks as soon as you can.  As Frank Herbert wrote, "Fear is the mind killer."</div>

<div class="content">okay I saved the task but when I tried to do it (at work) I realized that the website was blocked by my company. I did what I could to advance the task then rewrote it next week.<br>A have no undone task for a few days so I can say I am relieved of this monstruous weight (lol)<br>I don't know why but DWM has a tendancy to push me to Do tasks instead of just looking and choosing between them. It is maybe a system that successfully implements the "get everything done" theory ^^</div>

<div class="content">"Fear has no redeeming qualities. Period."<br><br>Feh. <br><br>Coming from a Chabad-oriented rabbi, I wouldn't his advice to seriously. Jewish theology is full of fear-oriented, cause/effect claims of doom and gloom. <br><br>Moreover, Rabbi Boteach a.k.a Michael Jackson's rabbi, is well known to provide Dr. Phil-esque advice that doesn't measure up to reality. <br><br>Case in point:<br>I heard the good rabbi address a crowd of 400 with the title: 10 steps to divorce-proofing your marriage. The advice was the same ol', same ol' you'd expect from any relationship coach. At the end of the talk, someone in the audience asked him if their aunt, who divorced 2 weeks prior to the talk, saw his list. Boteach laughted and said: No, she didn't. If she did, she'd still be married. Uh huh. <br><br>Entertaining guy, but hard to take seriously. <br><br>Anyway, fear/stick is a great motivator so long as it is coupled with juicy carrots.</div>

<div class="content">The literature comes down on the side of rewards pretty conclusively. Here's one potential reason why imo. If you are doing something out of fear, you are mentally rehearsing what you do NOT want to do. IOW, "If I don't look at my DWM list, I could dismiss that super-important task and then x, y, and nasty z could happen." I see myself not doing what I want to be doing. If, on the other hand, I focus on rewards, I see myself doing the desired behavior and earning the reward. We know that our thoughts and mental imagery are powerful antecedents to behavior. Can't tell you how many times I've thought during a tennis match, "Oh no! I hope I don't double fault!" only to do just that.<br><br>I see a problem even in thinking that we are the kinds of people that are best motivated by fear. Underlying that thought is the belief that I am lazy, undisciplined, a procrastinator, and so forth. How does this negative self-labeling move me toward my goals?<br><br>Then again, some people actually enjoy being afraid. Check out the top ten Blockbuster rentals each week and at least half of them are horror flicks. Some people would rather procrastinate a task to make it more exciting: "Will I not get it done and finally get fired?" That kind of thing. To each his own. I'm done using fear as a motivator in my life. I have plenty of other people who will try and use it for me. ;-)</div>

<div class="meta">2010-02-16 7:21</div>
<div class="content">Well, let's look at things honestly. There is really nothing close to fear in doing DWM. As long as you put tasks that help you, or tasks that you really like to do (like eat chocolate or rest 10 minutes, or read marks forum) you will follow the rules. But if you don't put the tasks you have pleasure to do and only the annoying stuff is on your list you will stop look at it. At least I have realized that I am fleeing the list when I forgot to enter the fun tasks.<br>As for the "fear", if too high, I think it can be resolved with separate lists for different contexts.</div>

<div class="content">The one thing about fear I think is that it is a lot more visceral, and therefore consistent. My desires, and therefore their motivational power, can change from day to day. My fears though, stay pretty much the same, and when triggered can be consistently relied upon to move me to action.<br><br>If I don't like being motivated by fear, the fear having to experience more fear can have me looking for positive motivators, but when the positive motivators fail, it is still the fear that gets to me.

<div class="content">I am not sure that DWM scales for all workloads, honestly.  Say that 300 items is right for DWM.  If you have 500 instead, then as soon as you hit that first 30-day mark, you're going to have a glut of items that are far too big for what you can contend with.<br><br>On AF4, there's a pacing I go at where I feel like I am actually getting things done, and that means I can only get through an entire of my cycle of my list every 2-3 days.  If I make sure that I get through the whole list in a day, I feel like I am being far too meta and spending too little a portion of my time being productive and "do-ing".<br><br>I'm still considering this.</div>

<div class="content">If you doubled your task list, you would double your work time.  In AF you would take twice as long to finish everything.  In DWM you would finish half in the usual time and abandon the other half for now.  I think the second course of action is better over all, though it's harder to live by.</div>

I know some people who can bearly sleep because of the excitement of their lives.  I have been there myself, but not consistently.  I think that is really the problem.  Most of us work to eat and would rather be doing something else if we could only find a way.  In that case, all we DO have is fear to motivate us.<br><br>>>>  If I don't like being motivated by fear, the fear having to experience more fear can have me looking for positive motivators, but when the positive motivators fail, it is still the fear that gets to me.

I believe that fear is easier to come by, but that joy can be one of most powerful motivators available.  It is responsible for the continuation of our species ... of all species, for example.

<div class="content">Mike, well put. Fear is MUCH easier to come by. The problem with fear that no one has mentioned is that it can do serious damage to one's emotional and physical health. Even David Allen recognized this problem in promoting a system that gives one a "mind like water." I assume he means still rather than falls. ;-) Please don't anyone blast me for misquoting him. I don't remember exactly what he said--just the essence.<br><br>Seraphim, I disagree. Using a singular exciting goal to motivate oneself is MEANT to be temporary. IOW, we can't expect a goal of "be the best person I can be" to do us any good on many levels. But a goal akin to the short-term current initiative certainly can be. I find that a singular goal becomes my focal point so that I don't even have to think about what else is most important. I tend to filter automatically. IOW, when I did nanowrimo, I made sure I got my writing done most days. I got meals made, laundry done, and the like but other goals went by the wayside without me deciding they needed to go. Right now my singular goal is very vague. I think my use of time would benefit if I made that goal clear.</div>

<div class="content">Mel,<br><br>It seems to me that many of the most successful people are monomaniacal.  I'm thinking of people like Edison who slept standing in line so he did not waste more time than necessary sleeping.  It seems as if there is so much they want from life that questions of procrastination or planning or goal balancing just don't hit their radar.<br><br>I agree that positive goals are not mostly sustaining across a wide area over a long time.  I think that there is a kind of meta goal -- for want of a better term.  I'm thinking of prolific professional writers, for example, who can't NOT write.  They don't write because of a goal to write a book so much as they are "driven" to write ... it is a passion.  Maybe that is the term I'm looking for.</div>

<div class="content">I think you're right, Mike, but I also think that those monomaniacal people were accused of being unbalanced and "bad" in many ways. We're doing a marriage Bible study at my church that includes Kurt and Brenda Warner. Kurt was the Rams quarterback from nowhere that led them to a Super Bowl victory and now plays for the Cardinals. Anyway, Brenda talks about Kurt's dream to play for the NFL when they were first married and how her friends kept telling her that he needed to let go of the dream and get a real job. Wow. <br><br>What's the lesson in that? For me, it's that I know what works best for me and that's it. So with respect to fear, if that works well for you, go for it!</div>

<div class="content">I think I agree with Seraphim.  Goals work for a short time.  That's why my goal is set to be something I can achieve in one month.  Next month I either go back to the usual or I find another goal to motivate me.  I'm hoping success in one goal will feel good enough that I'll be energized for another.  We'll see.</div>

<div class="meta">2010-02-20 1:13</div>
<div class="content">Alan, I think it really depends on the goal and (apparently) the person.  There are some bigger goals that you can't just set and achieve in a month, but you can achieve a part of that goal.  Just say you want to retire early - at 45 y.o. or something similar and you're 40 now, you don't set that as a goal to be achieved in a month.  Maybe saving a couple of thousand bucks and monitoring your expenses all month or something can be the goal for the month that's tied into the larger goal.  But unless you have the big long-term dream, you'll lose sight of why you're doing it and probably a lot of the enthusiasm.  I've personally had my biggest successes with the big long-term dreams that I just worked on day after day for years at a time.  Prioritizing all along too.</div>

<div class="meta">2010-02-20 2:04</div>
<div class="content">Did you set milestones along the way?  <br><br>Eg. Early retirement isn't my goal, but if it were, spending a month learning how to manage my expenses so I'm saving monthly would be a one month goal.  Having learned that habit, I could pursue another and not worry about the expenses thing because that's already established.</div>
<h2>Reply by Jacqueline</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-02-20 4:21</div>
<div class="content">Re. milestones - just for example, when I was going through University, I wanted / needed to stay on the Dean's list for scholarships and to get a job with a top CA firm after graduating.  I set 'milestones' for every exam, every paper and every course with the ultimate goal of maintaining a GPA higher than 3.75 throughout the 4 years.<br><br>For retirement, because it's so easy to succumb to lifestyle inflation along with your increasing income, I didn't rely on having really learned a habit well in the beginning because it's too easy to get derailed.  Later on, after a year or so, it was more ingrained.  I'd set a target to save a certain amount every month because that was basically a 5 year goal.  But then stuff happens to derail you, so you have to adjust along the way.  And prioritize - what's more important - that holiday now or the dream of retirement (a permanent holiday)?<br><br>I don't believe in the theory of '21 (or 30) days to establish a habit' type thinking - I've gone 3 or 4 years straight of exercising almost every day and had a major OT job get me off track for months, even years.  I think you have to stick with something until you get that mental shift in place of 'this is who I am'.<br><br>But I think you're right to pick something that you're really excited about and if you can do it or part of it in a month, that's great.  The 100 goals I set for this year are all pretty much achievable in a month of focusing on them or even one-offs.  Only a few are fear based though, which is maybe a mistake now that I'm thinking of my usual m.o. :-)  My GPA goal was driven more by fear than excitement, and actually the retirement goal was driven by fear too - more not wanting to have to put up with BS than anything else.</div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline,<br><br>I'm wondering how you managed to come up with 100 goals.  That sounds like an unmanageable number to me.  I think I have about 1/2 dozen or so goals ... but maybe your goals are more of what I'd call "steps" or "sub goals" or maybe even "milestones"?<br><br><needing to lie down after just THINKING of 100 goals>  ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Mel made me do it Mike.  I didn't want to, but she forced me.  LOL<br><br>Yeah, most of them are steps and sub goals more than "real" goals.  Like I've got the big goal to read everything by Aristotle someday, but only challenged myself to read 3 of his works this year.  Or stuff like going out with friend(s) at least once a week which I will forget about if I don't monitor it.<br><br>It's not really unmanageable because before I got sick (AFTER retiring - how fair is that!  Grrr), once a week, I'd just pick 2-3 of them to focus on for the week.  And I've been trying DWM out in my weekly diary and it seems to be working out okay (nice to have just 4 pages to review anyway) so I just throw more into the system.  I can keep the pages down just because I don't have any junk tasks on there like 'eat lunch' or 'do dishes' and I chunked up my task size a bit. :-)  Also have the scheduled daily part to list stuff I want to do that day (mostly errands) specifically to structure my day a bit.  I tried out the daily calendar page thing and didn't care for it.  I'm glad I switched back to the weekly calendar.</div>

<div class="content">Yeah, well, Mel can be like that.  She shamed me into buying the Toodledo iPhone app.  LOL ;-)<br><br>Sick:  I'm so sorry.  I hope it is not serious and that you are feeling better soon.<br><br>Structure: Oh boy do you need that.  They tell you that in the preretirement counseling classes and you think: "Feh, not me."  But you can start to "drift" rather easily.  That is one reason I have put a schedule in place for myself.  For years I took a shower first thing.  Now I'll think: "I'm going to be working outside today, may as well take a shower later."  So I don't get around to it until 3:00 in the afternoon.  And that kind of violates my sense of time.  Internally it seems as if I am not starting my day until late in the afternoon, if you get that.<br><br>I found it surprisingly difficult to stick to a schedule when it was arbitrary ... i.e. not dictated by having to go out and work for the man.  I then found that I was scheduling things that should be "rules" rather than scheduled items.  Ex: wash the dishes after meals, rather than at a time of day.  It is a funny learning experience.<br><br>Aristotle:  Lots of luck on three of his books this year ;-)  Some are a bit heavy.  The Organan was a year long course in college ;-)  I'm glad you are doing Aristotle, most people hear the name Plato more often so skip Aristotle.  And Plato is so much easier a read that people would rather skip over the hard stuff ;-)  Let me know how it goes and, if you like, we can argue about Aristotle over on my list ;-)</div>

<div class="content">The funny thing is I am no longer using a 100 Goals List or the Toodledo iPhone app. Suckers. ROTFL</div>

<div class="content">Hey, Alan, I really shouldn't be posting on this forum as I'm not using AF or DWM or even DIT! I do have a written 100 Goals List for the year, but I'm just going to refer to it at the end of the year and see what I did. My problem with it was the same problem I had with all the afore-mentioned systems. I went overboard. My personality is such that I do better when I just limit my list to things I have to do that are time-sensitive. I use my calendar, of course. <br><br>Lately, I also started using gootodo to manage my email-related tasks. This works brilliantly for me. I just downloaded an iPhone app yesterday called Priority Wise. It keeps track of how often you are doing things that are important to you and also allows you to compare your activity across life areas. I'm using this for just a few habits I want to develop because I don't have to feel guilty if I didn't do something. I only enter when I DO do something and as a reward, I see a bar graph grow under that task. So I have things like Groom Dog and Read to Kids (outside of school). <br><br>The rest of the time I just do what needs doing. I wash clothes, clean, help the kids and dh, write blog posts as they stand out without putting them on a list. I've written about that quite a bit here before, but I'm sorry that "Look for post explaining approach on forum" isn't standing out right now and order pizza is. LOL</div>

<div class="content">Awesome, Mel.  I've come to notice that my own habits and environment are big factors in the success of using Mark's systems.  It nicely covers areas where I'm lacking, and where I have some strength (e.g. in laying out projects) this balances what's not in the AF system.  And because DWM is now taking care of pushing things forward, I can use my freer mind to observe and track progress on goals and delegation.<br><br>I totally get how a different mindset might be a mismatch for Mark's ideas.</div>

<div class="content">Alan, I'm really glad DWM is working for you. It has a factor that I blogged about as being a great procrastination buster: working ahead. IMO, the more obligated we feel to do something (and typically things that are due today or soon fall in that category), the more likely we are to procrastinate doing them. So psychologically when you work on DWM tasks that aren't "due" for a week or or month, you feel like you are making a virtuous choice. It's a great approach.</div>
