<div class="content">I've even succeeded in confusing myself with the different variations I've been testing, so I've decided to start a new thread for this one.

<div class="content">A word or two on what I hope to achieve from this variation:<br><br>The original variation in which it was made compulsory to finish C2 before starting on C1 gave a very tight control and proved to be the most productive of all the variations I've tried. However it was rather a blunt instrument as far as timing was concerned and also the compulsory nature of the tasks started to raise resistance to the system after working with it for some time.<br><br>So to make it easier to adjust the timing I have blended it with the rule about where urgent tasks are entered, together with the "snooze" rule. The "snooze" rule also reduces the compulsory nature of the rules without - I hope - reducing their grip.<br><br>So essentially what is happening is that C1 and C2 form two separate lists which are worked on in turn. C1 tasks are only worked on if they are selected to be worked on, and C2 tasks are always worked on unless they are selected not to be worked on.</div>

<div class="content">I've been doing the C2 before C1 by sorting my Toodledo list with "Priority : Forwards", so my C2 task with priority "3 Top" is at the top of the list. I've effectively been "snoozing" my C2, just moving it forward one page  "when I consider it done for now". I did find resistance to working on the list otherwise. I'm also keeping my C2 task not much more than one.<br><br>Hence, I'll follow the rules as you set out here. Particularly moving C2 to C1, if it was snoozed on the last page. I haven't done that so far.</div>

<div class="content">It's a little peculiar, but it works.<br><br>I'm using a MS OneNote notebook.  Each section represents an SF column 1, but also has a count of completed tasks in column 2.  One additional section labeled Active is divided into two: the column 2 for the active page, and the column 2 for the next page.  As I advance pages in Column 1, I drag the Active page along as a bookmark, and up the column 2 counts.</div>

<div class="content">I'm giving this a shot today, but I haven't had any C2s with more than one task yet today (I just finished my first pass through the list and have been carrying that one C2 task forward through little and often (grading a couple of student essays on each pass)) so I can't say yet how it's going to work for me.  I like it in principle, though.</div>

Rather, the C2 count exists to ensure you don't abuse C2 and keep the list under control. The exact number of the limit could be adjusted though, and in my practise I rarely reach even 15.</div>

<div class="content">Mark, I am missing the distinction between the current variation that you described just above on Apr 19, vs. the one you described Apr. 14. In both cases, the feature under test is that C2 tasks can be demoted to C1 at any time. Are there differences in the other details?<br><br>I am watching these experiments with great interest, as I have that "almost perfect" feeling about SF. As you put it earlier, there is a certain timing issue once tasks get into C2. There are times when I want to be in-progress on, say tasks X, Y, and Z, but I cannot or do not want to work on them in a strict rotation. Rather, XYXZZXYYXZ or any such variation (working on little C1 items in between each capital letter). Maybe it feels good to get started on Y in a smallish way in the morning, but the intense work will fit much better in the afternoon.<br><br>There are various ways to achieve this pattern using an external project list and adjusting the notion of "done" to allow these tasks to come and go from C2 at will, but it would be really excellent if some C2 rule adjustment would allow this to happen without the external list and without opening too many loopholes.<br><br>A tall order, but if anyone can figure it out, it's you! Thanks for continually innovating and testing.</div>

In both cases, the feature under test is that C2 tasks can be demoted to C1 at any time. Are there differences in the other details? >><br><br>There are two differences, one quite major and the other relatively minor.<br><br>1) The ability to put a C2 task "on snooze" has been removed. All tasks in C2 which are not worked on are "demoted" to C1. I was finding that the "snooze" rule resulted in a collection of tasks which travelled along with me in C2 without getting actioned. This removed a lot of the purpose of C2 and also increased my resistance to working on the list. Now the choice is simple: Work on it or it will be put back in C1.<br><br>2) The second change is more subtle. In the April 14 rules the decision to "snooze" a task or move it to C1 was a positive one. This meant that when you considered a C2 task, you had four choices: i) do some work on it, ii) put it on snooze; iii) move it to C1; iv) leave it for now. This was getting a long way from the simple concept of "do it if it stands out". The April 19 rules restore "Do it if it stands out" as the only option. Any C2 tasks which don't stand out are moved to C1 automatically. Although this may seem to be quite a minor change, it makes working the list more intuitive, which was beginning to get lost.</div>

<div class="content">I haven't tried it yet, but I like this variation philosophically over the previous one for the reasons Mark sited in #2 above. I felt like there were too many ways to make excuses. But I also found with shifting priorities, I often wanted to demote items to C1 from C2, and did. So I guess I've been doing this variation intermittently. It seems to be the most common sense variation to me.</div>

<div class="content">I like the snooze feature and the demotion to C1 whenever a C2 task is continued or snoozed all the way to the end of the list.<br><br>But I have an issue with the strict all-C2-before-C1 rule: If I've just continued a C1 task to C2 on the next page (with no other unactioned C2 tasks listed), and nothing else stands out on the current page, it seems I am forced to immediately continue, snooze, or demote the same task. In this case, I cannot choose a C1 task on the new current page, as a way to alternate my work before reconsidering the same task I had just actioned. For this reason, and since I make rare use of C2 anyway, I'm not adopting this C2-before-C1 variation.</div>

The remnants left in C2 showed me at a glance which projects were in-progress, vs. those in C1 which I hadn't started yet. I remember feeling motivated to follow up on C2 items, without the resistance caused by the standard version's forced march.</div>
