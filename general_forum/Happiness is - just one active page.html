<div class="content">Today, I reached a point with AF that I expected never to see.  I have just one active page with 19 live items on it.  <br><br>Gradually over the weeks since AF began, I have been tending more and more to work closer to the last few pages of my book and last night I fully expected to end the day with only two active pages.  You can imagine my satisfaction with getting 20 tasks done today and having just the one page remaining active.  Most of the remaining items are recurring, so I do not expect to lower the number any further.<br><br>I cannot imagine how others can work AF effectively with 20 or more active pages.  I can only percieve that they must be dealing with heafty backlogs and something will have to give before too long.<br><br>I am starting to believe that Af is gently training me to take on no more than what can be done with just 7 normal days each week.  It is a very long time since I have had the feeling I have today that I am "up with things" and that there are few if any important things that have fallen through the cracks.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jim<br><br>Speaking as someone with currently 31 active pages and around 350 active items as an average, I can confirm that I started AF with a very hefty backlog!  I have no doubt that there will still be a few things that will fall through theh cracks, because at present I do have "too much" to do - BUT for the first time since I can remember, the backlogs are reducing rather than growing and I can see that there will eventually become a time when my lists are both a lot smaller and filled more with routine and fun items than with backlogs.  I look forward to that day but in the meantime feel so much more in control with AF that I really do not believe that "something will have to give before too long"</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine<br><br>I have no doubt that you will continue to cope with the formidable array of items that you have on your lists.  You clearly have an enormous enthusiasm for this enterprise and I cannot easily imagine your being diverted from your course.<br><br>However, I have seen that there are others who dare not trust the system when they are reminded how much they have on their plates and who may not persevere if they feel overwhelmed.<br><br>Simple though AF is, there are plenty of ways we can fail to live up to all that it asks of us and if we tamper with its integrity it may not serve us as it is meant to.<br><br>One thing that excites me is that I seem to be approaching the point where it is becoming more and more like DIT insofar as I am more aware than previously of what a "realistic" profile of tasks looks like, I feel less attracted to random items as they come in and I am usually confident that important things will be done effectively very soon (if not tomorrow.)</div>

<div class="content">My experience is going the same way. My backlog IS decreasing even though I am working more at the end of my pages because that is all current work.<br>Autofocus is training me to drop the 'all-or-nothing perfectioinst procrastination' excuses and be quite happy with just a small move forward on one or two items, seeing that as an achievement, not as a failure because I haven't finished anything perfectly!<br>Little-and-often training does get results.<br>My main problem is that because I started AF with a long, long list, I haven't yet had a day when I can start at the first active page and stick with it until nothing else stands out before moving on to the next - there is always a pressing current item that needs to be attended to first.<br><br>The other problem is that there are so many useful comments and tips on the Discussion Forum that I could spend all day on it - I have to put it down as an item on my AF list and be disciplined about it.<br><br>Giulia B<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Jim<br><br>You're absolutely right in that AF seems to work well for us regardless of our tendencies - i.e. preferring a more structured approach, or a a freeer approach.  As someone who likes (needs) both at varying times AF meets all my needs.  Just wish it could do some of the tasks for me.... :-( <br><br>"Simple though AF is, there are plenty of ways we can fail to live up to all that it asks of us and if we tamper with its integrity it may not serve us as it is meant to."  i have certainly found that to be true - the hardest part, when you face a massive backlog and looming deadlines, is that need to "trust the system".  I suspect that, even though I am doing better on that point, it will be a long time before I don't experience those panic moments occasionally!<br><br>Giulia<br><br>I think that perfectionism is one of the things that AF highlights very quickly and that by addressing that in ourselves it somehow releases a whole of other stuff and enables the system to really flow effectively.  I wonder how many of our backlogs are as a result of that desire to do it in a particular way or by our definition of perfectly?<br><br></div>

<div class="content"><br>Could I say that a page (or two or three in AF) is quite close from my own experience, in my agenda (a day a page, divided in left: agenda; right: AF lists)?<br><br>Depending on one's mind and life's cicrumstances, one would prefer a longer list (items move slowly, with longer slots on each or because of smaller tasks, ie more detailed) and one will adopt a shorter list (items move "quickly", but with high level of recurrence, as less divided tasks)?<br><br>In both case: this is AF!<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Pascal<br><br>I think you raise a very interesting point when you talk about "one's mind and life circumstances".  I think we have a concept of how we would like our lists to be and it is to some extent that concept that causes us some degree of frustration.  If we, thinking rationally about our lists, feel we should spend longer, or that we should be moving more quickly, then either "belief" will give us a feeling of unease if our experience varies from that.  I believe that our AF will actually settle down according to our preferred way of thinking and doing, and you are right, in either case (such as large project items worked little & often, or small individual tasks) - this is AF.<br><br>What I have found is that AF has enabled me to go through the process of redefining my tasks and as a result expressing them in the way that works best for me.  My tasks on early pages are written differently to later pages.<br><br>What I find as a general rule is that, on the first two or three passes of a 38 task page, I will do about half of the items.  The remaining items will clear at the rate of 3-7 on each consecutive pass.  Why that number? - no idea, but a definite pattern is starting to emerge.<br><br>I "want" to have less pages but am not finding the number of pages to be a real problem for me.  As I say definite patterns are starting to emerge and I find I can normally identify reasons for resistance fairly promptly - doesn't mean I necessarily want to deal with those reasons but that's another subject:-)</div>

<div class="content">I have many pages too ... I scan them all just to make sure there are no time sensitive items that absolutely can't wait.  Then I go back to the first active page and start working.<br><br>My backlog is decreasing too.  I also don't have to spend 30 minutes a day just managing my lists.</div>

<div class="content">I've found over the time I've been doing AF (and I've got about a month's start over everyone else) that the way I've gone through the list has changed several times. This seems to reflect changes in my circumstances, and possibly even the time of year as well!<br><br>At the moment I have 14 active pages, but I only go back to the older pages about once every three days. The rest of the time I spend on the last couple of pages. This seems to work very well at the moment, but I expect that it will change again as I get into new things.<br><br>I've found the way the list changes to meet the demands of the moment to be endlessly fascinating. <br><br>And I hardly ever nowadays find myself needing to invoke the "commonsense rule" of "if it needs doing now, do it now". In fact I've stopped worrying about producing work in time for deadlines. The system delivers it all on time without any fuss.</div>
