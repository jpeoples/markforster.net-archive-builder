<div class="content">On dating everything: <a href="http://www.asianefficiency.com/habits/get-habit-dating-everything/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.asianefficiency.com/habits/get-habit-dating-everything/</a><br><br>Since I own Omnifocus 2 (iphone), and took part in Omni 2.0 Beta for Mac, I couldn't resist purchasing the final product. Because of this, I've returned to an abridged form of DWM - all new/unfinished tasks and projects get a 7 day deadline.</div>

<div class="content">Can you give us a short description of how you set it up in OmniFocus? I also have both.</div>

<div class="content">Erin - <br><br>My Omnifocus setup is loosely based on ideas from DWM, GTD and 7 Habits. The gist: <br><br>1. Folders that represent each of my Roles & Sharpen the Saw items<br>2. Projects (these receive a due date of 7 days - subsequently all tasks associated with this project receive the same due date)<br>3. Next actions for each project <br><br>All reoccurring and new projects are given a 1 Week due date. Unlike DWM, I employ GTD's Someday idea via the "On Hold" feature in Omnifocus. However if I'm such a lazy slob, and can't even manage to change a project status to "On Hold", and it is overdue, I dismiss (delete) the project from Omnifocus.<br><br>I also make extensive use of the notes field (in projects) and provide updates of thinking/feeling/progress/struggles for every project - whenever I work on it, and during my weekly review.</div>

<div class="content">Good ideas Avrum, I haven't used the "on hold" feature or notes in the project section, just tasks. When you work the list do you just go by the due dates or do you use next actions perspective?</div>

<div class="content"><<When you work the list do you just go by the due dates or do you use next actions perspective>><br><br>Given that I have a low threshold for boredom, I take advantage of the number of ways you can work with Omnifocus:<br><br>1. By Forecast view (particularly when I'm in a DWM'ish kinda mood - whatever that means)<br>2. By Context <br>3. Perspectives (I purchased PRO, and use two different custom perspectives)<br>4. By project<br>5. Review (Every Friday afternoon)<br><br>Hope that's helpful.</div>

<div class="content">Does that mean you are circulating around the list in any of the 5 ways and expiring or putting on hold anything previous to the current date? I set up a perspective called added which sort the list by date added rather than deadline of a week away. I like the way you do it, simpler to see at all levels.</div>

<div class="content"><<Does that mean you are circulating around the list...>><br><br>I have a number of ways to approach my lists, any of them work depending on my mood. But the most important element is dating all new/reoccurring projects & dismissal.</div>

<div class="content">Thursday, June 12<br><br>16 days and counting...  using a modified version of DWM** (7 days for all new and repeating tasks). And a lot of dismissal!<br><br>** with Marketcircle's Daylite</div>

<div class="content">I thought you were using OmniFocus. Daylite looks good but expensive. Are you using the server version?<br><br>I tried dating all my incoming tasks and projects, just makes me feel behind. Clearly not enough dismissal!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Erin.<br><br>I was using Omnifocus. But for years, I've owned, and kept my eye on, Daylite. I wear a lot of hats, and Omnifocus doesn't cut it for case notes, CRM and project management. As far as I can tell, Daylite 5 is quite stable, with some great new features. <br><br>With respect to the dating scheme... I'm pretty sure Mark said, and I'd agree, that the system isn't at fault if you're not getting to your tasks/projects on time. Perhaps you've got too much on your plate.</div>

<div class="content">I'm an avid user of Daylite, I think its' the best app out there for integrating projects, teams, people and calendar. The email integration is phenomenal as well. However, I don't use daylite for tasks, instead I use a small moleskin notebook. On my notebook I made my own rules for combining SMEMA, FV and Random.</div>

<div class="content">Paul - Daylite's ability to pre-populate new tasks with a specified date was one of the largest selling points for me. True, the task portion of the app is overkill (for many people). But over time, all project activity (tasks, appts, notes) turns into a narrative (in the right pane). I really dig that</div>
