<div class="content">By Terrence Tao, one of the brightest minds in the math world.  What he's saying is when he was taking undergrad courses he could just look at his assignments and dash off his work because it was easy.  Once things get harder you actually have to study, or problems take time to work through.  There is no quick work any more.</div>

<div class="content">I think what he says about intuition is basically what I have been saying for ages (and for which I claim no originality):<br><br>Intuition isn't some divine revelation from above, but the voice of your accumulated knowledge and experience. I often give the example of a fire chief giving instructions during a fire, or a pilot dealing with an emergency situation. Both situations require split-second reactions which they do intutively. But without their knowledge and experience, they wouldn't have the intuition.<br><br>Also worth reading are his thoughts on time management, which he gives a link to in his article. <a href="http://terrytao.wordpress.com/2008/08/07/on-time-management/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://terrytao.wordpress.com/2008/08/07/on-time-management/</a></div>
