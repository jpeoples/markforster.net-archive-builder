<div class="content">Would you use AF when you are on holidays?<br><br>I notice that some of us seem to use AF all day every day. Others clearly may go for days without looking at their lists.<br><br>This raises the question for me: Would I use it when holiday time comes around?  My first reaction is that I would not do so. But, after consideration, I am more inclined to expect that I would.  Holiday times also have 24 hours each day to fill in in a profitable way.  Some types of holidays involve organized travel that might leave very little discretionary time and AF might not be so appropriate.  Other people may choose to do only two things on holiday: sleep and walk on the beach.  You would not want AF to help you to organize that.<br><br>Most of my holidays leave room for a great variety of activities and I must say I do like to put a lot of planning into them.  So I can imagine that I would want AF where I could list such things as:<br><br>Outline my ideas for the holiday.<br>Exercise<br>Supermarket shopping<br>Swim<br>Sit in the shade<br>Prepare a shopping list<br>Tomorrow's meals<br>Buy a book<br>Send postcards<br>Study available tours<br>Book for dinner Saturday<br>Watch Agatha Christie on TV<br>Do my craft work<br>Roam around the Mall<br><br>An alternative approach would be to say that holidays are for just drifting around and doing nothing but follow whims.  But I have found in the past that I have experienced what Mark has called the "fractured day" even on holidays in which I have been sleeping when the sun was ideal for swimming, when I have wanted to go to the shops after they were shut and when I forgot to read the books I had put aside as ideal for the holidays.<br><br>My inclination is to say that holiday time can profit just as much by the use of AF as the rest of the year can.<br><br>Has anybody tried it yet?  What are the advantages or disadvantages?</div>
