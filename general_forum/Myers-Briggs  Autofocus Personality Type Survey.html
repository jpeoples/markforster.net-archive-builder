<div class="content">If you know your Myers-Briggs personality type and would be willing to share it with us, please add it to the thread below along with a brief description of how easy/hard it has been for you to use Autofocus so far.<br><br>If you have no idea what the Myers-Briggs Type Personality Type Indicator is or simply don't care, please accept my humble apologies for wasting 19 seconds of your life and feel free to ignore this thread completely.<br><br>Alternatively, you can find out more online at, for example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator</a><br><br>This is an informal (and unofficial!) survey just to satisfy the curiosity of a few forum participants about which personality types are most suited to using Autofocus. This follows on from a discussion at <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/625483" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/625483</a></div>

<div class="content">To get the ball rolling, I am mostly INTJ though have been known to drift into ENTJ.<br><br>I've found Autofocus from day one to be extremely easy and natural to use and am still amazed that no-one has come up with this idea before.</div>

<div class="content">I am in the middle on three of the letters; however, after looking at the descriptions I think I fit the INFJ a little more than the others.  <br><br>I have enjoyed the first week of doing AF.  I think that just now I am actually doing AF as it was intended and finding it a blast.  I am trying not to get bogged down with too much analysis but more quickly cycle through the pages. <br><br>So far so good.</div>

<div class="content">I am an INTP.  I think Autofocus fits this type well because there is a wide variety of tasks, and is more unstructured (NP).</div>

<div class="content">I am INTJ, which seems to fit quite well. It is probably why this is my first comment although I started AF a week ago and there has been a lot I could have posted about.<br><br>I found AF difficult at first, having come from highly structured task planning using MyLifeOrganized (MLO). I tried AF on paper first, but that was such a departure from what I have been used to for the last ten years, I found lots of problems with it. I tried to combine it with MLO, but it isn't really suited. I tried using Jarte, which worked quite well, and I tried Excel, which worked less well, but have surprisingly come back to paper, which I now think is the only way to do AF properly (for me, at least). The problems I had with paper turned out to be solely due to my unfamiliarity with it and my previous reliance on electronic technology.<br><br>So far, AF seems to be the best personal management system I have ever come across (and I have tried quite a few). Thanks, Mark.</div>

<div class="content">Had never heard of this before the earlier post. Googled it, found an online test (sorry forgotten which one) and got a result of INFJ for what it's worth!<br><br>I found it easy to use Autofocus and am still using it. This week has been very disrupted but have found the times I've been able to use my list very useful - completing some tasks that had been hanging around for ages.<br><br>I've never been very sure of these types of tests simply because I find that my answers vary quite a bit depending on what mood I'm in. They only give you a yes or no choice and I often think "but I want to say both". So I expect, like Mark, I may find that next time I do one I'll be something different.<br><br>Anyway, for the sake of your question Frank, I thought I'd let you know what it came up with this time!</div>

<div class="content">Extended version: I'm an INFP, supposedly, and I like AF. I freeze into hopeless procrastination when faced with a structured task list. I'm happily productive when I'm winging it, so long as in winging it I've got some sort of rough course charted. AF gives me the impression that I'm flying my own course, but keeps presenting me with markers to remind me that there are boundaries to navigate within. For my particular mindset, that's perfect.</div>

<div class="content">INFP the times I've been tested (some years ago now).  I'm still having trouble with procrastination with this system.  I do like the system, but it would work better if I would "open the file" and look at it instead of doing something else.  I think I'm getting more done, but nowhere near at the thunderous rate some are describing.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-01-12 17:59</div>
<div class="content">To amend my last:  I AM getting more done, make no mistake.  I just looked at my list and see a lot of cross-outs.  Doing something on a task and then crossing out and adding it to the end of the list is immensely useful, since I'm making progress at least.  And many items are actually now done that have been lingering forever prior to using this method.<br><br>I love GTD, but I have to admit some of my lists have been rotting untouched and I'm not very good at regular weekly reviews.  Maybe it's my Myers-Briggs...</div>

<div class="meta">2009-01-17 23:44</div>
<div class="content">The number of introverts certainly has been unexpected - to me, at least.<br><br>I've been mulling this over a bit and I suspect it is like someone earlier hinted at...that this type of personality is naturally drawn towards time management. So there might be a similar situation at the GTD forums.<br><br>When I think of some of the "typical" extroverts I have known (usually sales-oriented), the need for a system to manage time would simply be a laughable idea to them.<br><br>I guess if I was being cynical then I would probably think the idea of them even being remotely organized would also seem a laughable idea to them. So it's fortunate that I'm not being cynical in any way whatsoever...and any extroverts reading this need not throw any rocks <grin></div>

<div class="content">I seem to recall you mentioning a leaning towards extravert tendencies, Frank - better be careful of those rocks, you might start throwing them at yourself :-)<br><br>What really worries me though is the accuracy of your comments - I told a friend I had started a new Time Management system and it took her about 5 minutes (literally!) to stop laughing. Huh!</div>

<div class="meta">2009-01-18 11:09</div>
<div class="content">Yes, Christine, I must admit that sometimes I do cross over to the "dark side" and become the life and soul of the party type - hence my comments also partly come from being guilty of it myself. I am aiming at large rock at the centre of my forehead as I type...</div>

<div class="content">I'm one of those "extroverts" - and must confess to lurking in the forum on a regular basis and finding everyone's input very useful in aiding my understanding and use of AF. From some of the posts I must be an exception to the introvert/extrovert 'rule' because I have always struggled with time management.  Or maybe its not that extroverts don't struggle with time management, it's just they are less likely to admit to struggling with anything? - just a thought :-)<br><br></div>
<h2>Reply by Frank</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-01-18 11:31</div>
<div class="content">Yes, Helen - that's what I meant. It's not that "extroverts" are time management experts...quite the opposite actually, it's just that they would probably say that they "have a life" and think the rest of us should get one. <grin></div>

<div class="meta">2009-01-18 12:04</div>
<div class="content">Frank,<br><br>I never used the Internet until I retired some years ago.  The first list I found was an INTP list ... can you imagine.  I loved it.  It was heaven being with all of my long lost twin brothers and sisters (especially for an INTP type as we are in the minority ;-)  In order to get a feel for other MBTI types, I searched for lists devoted to those types.  Imagine my surprise when I found lists for some other types but almost NONE for "E" types.  My surprise lasted about five seconds then the light dawned.  Hell, they are all at a party now  ... i is only us "I" types who hang around in virtual space! ;-)<br><br>I have only thought of it in passing, but it would be a good subject to discuss somewhere.  What are the characteristics of those who post to internet mail lists, blogs, etc.  Introverts?  Yes, for sure.  There also seems to be a high incidence of ADD, and I'm sensing some bi-polarity as well.  But those are just impressions.  I'll bet someone is doing a PhD thesis somewhere ... ;-)</div>
<h2>Reply by Christine B</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-01-18 16:52</div>
<div class="content">Frank's comments re E's and Time Management are interesting; unfortunately for me my Time Management issues might tell everyone else to "get a life" but somehow I never have time for one myself.  If being a TM expert means identifying and/or creating great systems from everyone else then I probably qualify - I know a great deal about TM systems <grin> but follow one ............?  (At least not until AF came along).<br><br>To clarify Introversion and Extraversion within MBTI, this relates to where we draw our energy from, and not how quiet or outgoing we may be.  I assumed when I did my test that I would be I (because I am generally comfortable with my own company and happy to work alone) but when I tested as an E I realised that I do in fact draw my energy from other people.  At work I had my own office but periodically had to go and wander around talking to other people.  I had always assumed it was because I was bored but it was a case of somehow topping up my energy.  I notice now that periodically I have to phone someone -I don't even particularly feel an overwhelming desire to carry on a conversation but somehow need that contact with another human being.  Don't know how that fits in with wandering around Discussion Forums.  This is the first forum I have participated in so haven't got much to judge against.</div>

<div class="content">ChrisK,<br><br>MBTI and Enneagram tests are most usefully analyzed by professionals.  Seems silly but there are things in them that require some consideration.  One "gotcha" is that personality type can SEEM to be influenced by context.  One example:  I am an Introvert, but I seem to be extroverted when I am at work.  In reality, in those cases I'm what is called a "compensated introvert" ... I can temporarily change my stripes, as it were ;-)  A professional (or someone who has lots of experience typing people) can get to the essential question of where your energy comes from.  One can have a big grin and shake all kinds of hands at a party, all the while feeling the life drain right out of him if he is a real Introvert.<br><br>My point is that when you answered the questions you might have been in a certain mood or not understood what some questions were really getting at.  This is very common and it can take a while for a person to type himself.  A pro can see all kinds of behavioral cues as well as just look at the answers on paper.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-01-21 11:31</div>
<div class="content">Mike makes a good point - the online MBTI tests are helpful in identifying the factors that may influence our view but typing should be conducted by a qualified practitioner for the reasons Mike states.<br><br>I would have considered myself to be I but careful questioning by my "typer" led me to realise that I am most certainly E, in that my energy definitely comes from others.  That does not in any way mean that I am deperate to party but that my energy levels/motivation etc. will be massively impacted by contact with others, whether it be in person, telephone, email or even interacting on this forum.  If I read about something that really motivates me, my first thought is "I want to share this with someone".  It can be incredibly frustrating if that person is an I and their response is along the lines of "tell me later when I'm not doing ....." as that immediately deflates the excitement and dissipates the energy.  I suspect E's can be great interrupters!</div>

<div class="content">INTJ, as are so many others responding to this thread.  This is an interesting patteren, as the percentage of INTJs refected here far outweighs their distribution in the general population.<br><br>And, like mmost of the other INTJs I love the system.<br><br>As an INTJ, so many other widely hyped systems are repellent to me.  It's fantastic for we rare INTJs to find an offering that is such a 'natural fit.'</div>

<div class="content">I'm INFJ<br><br>AutoFocus is the first system that has actually resulted in progress.  I got stuck on the "capturing everything" aspect of GTD, and felt huge resistance to doing a weekly review, whereas the structured procrastination is much more likely to result in me doing something</div>

<div class="content">ENTP - I seem to be very rare. Almost forced to using specific To-Do Lists for many years of being a full-time working and mainly single mother, I had to be super organised BUT oh goodness how I enjoy going with the flow. So AF is really super - it allows me to chop and change, love the variety, love the freedom from A,B,C priorities. Having it on a list has always relieved me of anxiety.</div>

<div class="content">Another ENTP. <br><br>I read Mark's DIT book and started applying his methodology. I combine it with aspects of GTD, but notice how much more I get done creating a closed list on a daily basis, using My Life Organized software.  I tried Autofocus for a couple of weeks in a basic paper based system. I did get a lot of actions done. 36 actions the first week end. 47 on the third. My DIT approach seems to get around 30 actions per weekend. I didn't stick with Autofocus long enough to be able to make a fair comparison. DIT works well enough for me and I prefer to keep it electronical, and for now I haven't bothered with adapting the electronic tool, nor run two separate systems. In a sense works for me is: 1. Cycling through the lists frequently 2. Progressing stuff based on the "little and often" 3. Committing to a certain number of actions in a day (closed list) and score myself accordingly if I accomplish that number and 0 points if I don't (as per Mark's deceivingly simple, yet very powerful little exercise in DIT, only I apply on a regular basis.) 4. Breaking tasks down to bitesized manageable chunks 5. Enter next actions à la GTD 6. Always allowing intuition to play a part in deciding which of the next actions to do.</div>

<div class="content">Here's your first ENFJ. Amazing how many I's and N's have responded. I've been doing Autofocus for about ten days. After just reading Mark's outline I completed a major task that I had been putting off for, oh, about four years. It took me five minutes. That was enough to inspire me to start a list in a notebook. I think the notebook aspect has a lot to do with it. I've been a list-maker for years, but once you throw that scrap of paper away, there's no proof of achievement! I love to see all the items crossed out! My husband and I have completely re-worked my website over the past ten days, and Autofocus served to keep me on track. I also find it much easier to release things that I feel I should do but really don't want to. Instead of feeling a tug of conscience, I just grin and keep going down the page. <br><br>I should also mention that we just got DSL about two hours ago and this is the first forum I felt drawn to check out. Hope I can stay focused on my list and not get seduced by the speedy internet connection!<br><br>Virginia</div>

<div class="content">I am an INTJ and I too am shocked at the number of INTJ's in this list - because we are very heavily represented here; and a very real minority of the population at large.<br><br>I signed up for the beta, and I even purchased a notebook - but I have been sticking with DIT because it is working so well for me. Seriously, I am terrified to deviate from something that has literally quadrupled my productivity. <br><br>However, given the overwhelming number of people who are INTJ and their success and happiness with AutoFocus - I am really persuaded to try AutoFocus...<br><br>Dennis Groves</div>

<div class="content">I just saw the extrovert/introvert discussion and have to say I'm right in the middle.  Most people describe as very much a people person.  The only reason I'm classified as an introvert is because I recharge alone.  People don't recharge me at all.  Hope this helps!</div>

<div class="content">Add another INTJ to the list.  I've been doing autofocus since the instructions were first posted.  I started electronically and recently switched to paper.  Love it.  Definitely keeping me focused on important stuff and getting more done than I thought possible.</div>

<div class="content">INFJ - a periodic adherent to the GTD system, but I really like the simplicity of Autofocus. I've only been using it a few days so far (and haven't finished my first page yet, as I've got a lot of large items to work on) but I'm really enjoying it! I find myself especially looking forward to dismissing my first page.</div>

<div class="content">Another ENFJ here.  Well I started writing my first book the same time I started using the system. Hadn't occurred to me til now that there may be a link! I've never actually had "write book" as an entry but I guess being able to put everything else in means I've been able to prioritise writing first every day, knowing that the rest will take care of itself. Thanks, Mark! <br>Lucinda</div>

<div class="content">INFP--off the charts on the N part. I am a self-employed creative type. Am not sure how this will work for me but I found GTD (while filled with noble purpose) to be too much overhead for me. I need something simple (or that is powerful but appears to be simple).</div>

<div class="content">Hello Lucinda and Virginia,<br><br>Another ENFJ, mainly N and F. Not many here. AF works fantastically for me. It seems to work well for a wide variety of types.<br><br>Key strengths are the way it unsticks entrenched, procrastinated tasks. Yes, some "urgent" items get done more slowly, but some items important to both you and others get done...when they normally would sit hidden for months or years.<br><br>That is of massive importance and I haven't seen it elsewhere.<br></div>

<div class="content">I am ESTJ.  I have been using AF for a month or so.  I find it great in that it has forced me to not be so rigid (I have issues with always wanting to be in control!), but very difficult for the same reason.  I feel like I am just doing "whatever" sometimes rather than something that really needs to be done.  I am also borderline Asperger's, so this is prolly related to the need for rules and boundaries.  AF is (hopefully) helping me get over this, as I'd like to be a little more comfortable with being spontaneous.</div>
