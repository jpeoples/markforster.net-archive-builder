<div class="content">When I reach a page with one final item on the Col1 which I am unable to action (because I am not in the right place/context), how do I handle the situation? Mark mentioned that for Col2 items you push the items to the next page. But given that this is Col1 item, does the same hold good or should the page be dismissed? Anyone deal with this situation? Thanks.<br><br>GC</div>

<div class="content">My hunch is to dismiss it. If it is the last item left, then presumably you have been past it several times and chosen not to do it. Now, here you are again and not even *able* to do it. It ain't getting done!<br><br>At least, not as written.<br><br>Dismissal will focus you on rethinking it and rewriting it, perhaps finding a better way of achieving the same thing, perhaps writing a better task that will be more likely to stand out or that you will be in a position to do more often.<br><br>Or, upon reflection, you may decide that this really was the best task to have on the list, and it just got unlucky. No biggie. Nothing says you can't put it back on the list—after a responsible review—if that is what's best.</div>

<div class="content">I regularly face this situation. I keep one notebook with each column of each page separated into home & work tasks, by writing home-related ones from the bottom up, and work-related from the top down (and drawing a heavy horizontal separation line when the column fills).  If I visit a page with C1 tasks I can only do at the other location, I just skip to the next page without dismissing.  If there are some C2 tasks on this page as well, I either do them (if possible) or transfer them to C2 of the next page.  <br><br>If there are some C1 tasks I could do (but choose not to), then the entire page gets dismissed. This means I might be dismissing some tasks that could be done later, when I get to the other location. But that's okay – when reviewing, they can be added back to the list if necessary.<br><br>Hope this helps.</div>

<div class="content">I guess I could try both ways. But, I am curious as to what the rules say. I re-read the rules but it doesn't really expound on this situation. May be I will first try to follow the rules strictly and dismiss them. Let me see how that goes.</div>

<div class="content">Mark Forster has "blessed" the method described by ubi as a valid method for handling two "locations" in one notebook -- as long as this is the way you normally structure things, and it's not just an ad-hoc decision.  Search for "stalagmite" or "stalactite" for more...<br><br>I used that method myself for a long time, but lately I've leaned more towards Bernie's way of thinking on the matter, and would just dismiss that item.<br><br>Yes, you can try both and see which works better for you.</div>

<div class="content">All, thanks for your help!<br><br>I mix my work/home items and there always seems to be a lack of focus with that. I initially tried 2 separate notebooks which didn't work. I was going to try single notebook but have work items start from the front page and home items start from the back page. But, I am intrigued by the stalactite/stalagmite method. I am going to try that first. Do you folks separate out tasks in C2 as well or just in C1? It may not matter to me as my C2 list is typically short.</div>

<div class="content">Greenchutney<br><br>"When I reach a page with one final item on the Col1 which I am unable to action (because I am not in the right place/context) deal with this situation? Thanks".<br><br>There is a simple solution. Use your agenda and put it at the right time or the right day and if you d'ont know when put it in a day such as saturday or sunday. But only if it is actionable. Ie you really want to do it. If you have many task (over than 5) dismiss it and block a time to do it writing "Do dismiss p X"<br><br>But Dismissal stuff acording to me is a very special situation. Dismissal are for action your brain doesnt want to do for any reason. He is un able to do it (just can't), he doesn't know (h's unable to decide). It just a thing that he may do or not and he wan't to think about it. In fact it's quiet simple it's just became non actionable. <br><br>I fond a simple solution about this. I keep actionable task in SF but non actionable task in Omnifocus. So I aloud me to re negotiate my engagements.</div>

<div class="content">Very nicely put Jupiter. I think you captured the spirit of dismissal. <br><br>In fact, this answered a related question in my mind regarding "waiting for" items. I put them into SF but they were dependent on someone responding. Of course they were non-actionable now as you put it because I wanted some time to pass before badgering them (when they become actionable)! So, moving these to a tickler file probably makes more sense.</div>
