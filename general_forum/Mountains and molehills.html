<div class="content">AF2 has helped me to embark on a chore that I have been putting off for 18 months.  I have a bag that's been damaged by airport baggage handling machinery.  I've had to glue it back together.<br><br>It's taken me 35 minutes.  Over the 18 months since the bag was damaged, I have probably devoted 350 minutes to thinking about repairing it, wondering why I don't repair it, scheduling days when I'm going to repair it, concocting good reasons not to repair it, and looking for ways to avoid trying to repair it, most obviously by buying a new one . (But luggage that's any good is surprisingly expensive, and I don't like any of the examplesI see in the shops.)<br><br>I can understand that one might resist embarking on a project that might prove time consuming or awkward or painful. But this was none of those.  Spending more time resisting something than it would have taken to complete is clearly maladaptive.  Why then do we do it?</div>

<div class="content">Hi David C<br>I'm not trying to be glib but it usually fits this broad template....(for me anyway).....<br><br>The process of doing it now rates fairly low in pleasure,reward or gratification compared to other options and, simultaneously, the punishment of not doing it now is non-existent. It will get done for reasons other than pleasant process or avoiding a punishing consequence................unless a punishing consequence draws closer, it's less onerous than other options or you decided to do based on other criteria.<br><br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">silted down:  There's little or no immediate pleasure/reward and no immediate negative consequence. That's why our system of doing things (including all of Mark's systems) have other governing criteria and/or governing rules added.<br><br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Other criteria and rules can be anything.....from meta-values and principles, the comfort of avoiding the pressures of looming negative consequences, external influences, ritualized procedures, rules/ structure, etc.....iow, anything that matters to you or proves effective for your purposes.<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">I was wondering the same thing.<br><br>Yesterday I completed two tasks originally from December 2005. I've been moving them around various ToDo-, Someday/Maybe- and other lists, keeping them every time I changed systems. When I switched to AutoFocus a few weeks ago I put them on the list to see what would happen.<br><br>Took me all of 10 minutes to complete them. Go figure.<br><br>The good thing is, of course, that AF2 apparently helps getting things done. A lot.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Nicole<br>The answer is simple.  The negative traits you attributed to this task or the fact that you always had more pleasant options available, caused you to never choose it because there were no internal or external influences to enforce it.  The other options available always trumped choosing this one.  See, the negative attributions created a resistance barrer to ever choose this over other "options available" without any other governing principles or rules in place to force the choice.  AF2 simply provided you with a governing rule to break the resistance barrier.<br><br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br>Not to equivicate but.....<br>You stated:<br>Learning as I go is right - we need methods to deal with these things that work, and this is where AF really shines over any other system.<br><br>That may be true for you and I'm glad that's your experience.  I failed miserably with it.<br>I'm not advocating that the use of AF is supreme to all other systems.  I'm simply advocating the use of a system that is effective at providing the needed assistance in the form of creating and enforcing additional criteria for both choosing and doing our work that doesn't natural inspire us in a reasonable timely manner....<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>My tolerations list is also radically different!  *blush*  It's far safer to generalize principles than it's subsets or permutations if you will.......<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Ah, learning - I should have said - that's where AF really shines *for me* (and for Nicole and David too it seems).  I tried doing the "100 thing list" several times over the years and followed it for all of, oh - one day - before falling off the wagon.<br><br>My list would be somewhat different than this as well - too much of it relating to my dog!  This reminds me - I should put some things on my AF list to resolve this digging problem I've been tolerating!!!<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br>ROTFL!  Maybe you could corral him in autumn where you want him to turn the soil for spring planting. and in the springtime he could be corralled to loosen the soil for your annual blooms!  ROTFL!  Just don't allow him to dig up the  buried corpse......<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br>I'm certainly not attempting to nit pick your choice of words.....but there might be newbees here with little foundational knowledge.  I try not to steer them off-course with mistaking my findings with general knowledge.  Just my little quirk....<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">..... or simply stop at that's where AF really shines.  The over any other system part could be misleading......  Back to another segment of work....my mind is starting to corrode over my own nonsense......ROTFL!<br>learning as I go</div>
