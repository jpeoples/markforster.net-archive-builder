<div class="content">Working with the randomizer has been pretty succesful for the past week or so, but I realized today I may have a problem coming up that I'd like to hear your collectively wisdom on.<br><br>In a little over 6 weeks, I'll be taking a long (4 months) break from work to travel. So I'm now trying to round up running projects, or transferring them to colleagues. I only realized today that there's only a bit over 6 weeks left, but my list of stuff is still pretty long. With the randomizer approach, I feel I'm working the list quite effectively, but I'm a bit worried some projects buried in my list are not being selected by the randomizer in time to be able to close them in a meaningful way.<br><br>I'm thinking of writing down a list of must-finish projects (including a quick note on what "finish" means), and use that list as a kind of "Current Initiative" list that I need to work on every day. Any other suggestions how to handle this?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Nicole,<br><br>That is precisely what I do. I maintain a deadline list, important deliverables tied to dates and a project list. I review those in the morning and add what I intend to work on today to post it note. I then mix the post it note in with yesterdays tasks with the randomizer. <br><br>I've realized that by day of sucess means that I have completed the post it, and along the way will have done a significant chunck (if not all) of yesterday's tasks. This is working well, but am picking up a backlog of past  tasks that have not gotten hit, but if they are tied to a deadline or to a project I know they will come up again on the post it note. I also plan on adding a "work the whole book" task on my post it note once a week to clear things out.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Nicole and Veghead Jones<br>I have a kind of rolling list.  Each day I date the page.  At the top are appointments and "must do today" calls or emails.<br>Next line is my day's MITs.<br>Just like DIT, I place new stuff "below the line". Where I deviate is that below the line, I'll write a few things I'd like to consider doing after the MITs are complete OR a few tasks to intentionally create relief if I know that I'll need it with a tough project on the MIT list. These few tasks are created by a quick review.  Example: I worked on one project almost 4 hours yesterday. Since it was an MIT on which I placed as asterisk, I didn't mind that not much else was worked on.  Today I spent another 1hr 43minutes and it's DONE.  Now I work from my considerations list.  <br><br>If I have a real headbanging job, that's the only MIT but I always have a few worthy considerations that are less stressful for relief.  I was too stubborn to take a break from it but it felt nice to have other tasks there just in case I needed some relief.<br><br>Like Veghead Jones, some weeks I'll devote a day (usually Thursday or Friday) to get things "current enough" overall so that, psychologically, the beginning of next week's work has a positive tone vs catch up. It also does double duty as a review of my overall work status. On those days, I rarely have any MITs that will take over an hour. That leaves plenty of time to wrap up loose ends.  I keep fake deadlines to help me keep pace. IOW, my projects and recurring stuff are current enough or ahead.  When I say that I don't mean every little thing is done.  I mean the important stuff and maintenance stuff is up to snuff.  Some stuff naturally becomes irrelevant with respect to ROI.  Bottom line: I make time for worthy work. The rest is optional.</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>Much of the time, I don't use the randomizer on my MITs.  If I do, the page has my MITs and a few of handpicked work I want to consider.  I'll use the randomizer on that page.  It my brain is getting fried, then I'll use the randomizer in a general scope including one offs and recurring work.  <br><br>Thanks, Veghead Jones.  That really helps me to remember not to ignore those tasks for too long.  I like to get to them BEFORE they reach MIT status but sometimes I have a tendency to work in longer blocks on MITs to the exclusion of all else.</div>

<div class="content">I've been running into this issue too.<br><br>For deadlines more than a few days out, I've found that Mark's systems generally handle those "automatically", and I've been letting Randomizer sort them out without any special treatment.   I've also been tracking my key projects on my kanban board, and highlighting deadlines like this, so I can see the status of projects at a glance, and whether anything is at risk.<br><br>Also, for things that must be done NOW, it's easy!   Just stop everything else and do them now!<br><br>The harder cases are things that must be done TODAY or maybe TOMORROW.   I'm not sure what to do with those.   For now, I'm writing them into my DIT notebook, and highlighting them.   I'm thinking I will try to stay on my TODAY page till all the highlighted items are done.   Only after that will I traverse the rest of the notebook and electronic list.   I'll let you know how it goes.</div>

<div class="content">Hm, here's an idea for a new general rule:  If your task has a hard deadline, highlight it.   Use the Randomizer as usual, but slide through all other tasks till ALL your highlighted tasks are completed.   If your highlighted task is "done enough for today", then you can move it to the Tomorrow page, and highlight it again.  It will then be off your active list, and wait till Tomorrow for you to take further action on it.<br><br>Moving it forward won't harm the "hammer effect", since you'll get the same effect from the highlighting.</div>
<h2>Reply by Seraphim</h2>
<div class="meta">2014-02-19 20:06</div>
<div class="content">Hm, to take that idea one step further...<br><br>Let's say you have a hard deadline for a task, to finish a presentation, due February 28.  And let's say it will start to get critical around February 25.<br><br>So, you could make two entries:  <br>"Finish presentation" - enter it tomorrow, no highlighting<br>"Finish presentation" - also enter it on February 25, with highlighting<br><br>That way, if Randomizer happens to neglect it for the next few days, it will stand out and demand attention right when it needs to, on February 25.   Hmm, I kinda like this, it seems kinda elegant.  I think I will give it a try.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Seraphim<br>2mc used to do that with his AF1 list with tabs that he could remove. Basically, it's quite similar to choosing MITs if you use only the highlighted items for a few rotations, yeah?  I never cross out MIT's until the end of the day just in case I get a surge of determination to work on it later in the day. This is especially true if the work is drenched in high resistance.  Sometimes, I'll meet my "enough for today" requirements but the idea of doing it again tomorrow repels me.  LOL!  I was supposed to just work on chosen considerations and the general list after my MITs were complete.  Instead, i reviewed my weekly list and saw another horrible job not done yet.  Since this morning's project was really lousy and difficult, I decided that I want a much easier day for tomorrow.  I took that job and worked on it but stopped at tying up loose ends.  I was just glad it's over with.  No sense of pride of completion: just pure relief that I don't have to look at it again until it repeats.  LOL!  I like to ride the wave when I'm in that sort of mood because it makes up for the days that I'm lazy and sluggish!  LOL!<br><br>I like the feeling when the day's MITs are done but my weakness is stopping short of tying up loose ends like today. Using Veghead Jones method of alternating the day's MITs with yesterday's list works beautifully for my weakness.  I also love his giving the general list a run through once in awhile to keep all the balls in the air.  Thanks, Veghead Jones.  You've helped my workflow in two major areas!  I absolutely hated doing some of the work but overall Veghead Jones modifications not only make the overall day feel almost fun but it works splendidly for tying up loose and and getting to stuff before it becomes an actual concern. Seraphim, have you tried any of Veghead's modifications?  It's especially great for working your MITs while also attending to other stuff.  The only way I see of making a backlog is if either outside forces swamp me with unexpected work or don't do Veghead Jone's yesterday's list sweeps and general sweeps often enough. These modifications make my little system even more powerful and more *fun*.  win-win so far....</div>

<div class="content">Hi Seraphim,<br><br>I've already started highlighting the important stuff, but your idea of sliding from highlight to highlight is brilliant, I'll try that. Also, the idea of highlighting only for today, but re-highlight around the date it will become critical is a good suggestion.<br><br>I guess my main concern is that *everything* will start to get critical within a few weeks, because in 6 weeks everything on my work list will have to be either finished or transferred to someone else or dropped for at least 4 months. Better get back to work right away :-).</div>

<div class="content">Nicole:<br><br>I've tried out two methods which cover your situation, both with a reasonable degree of success.<br><br>***Method 1***<br><br>Mark up any tasks which you want or need to work on during your next pass through the list. Proceed as normal, except that whenever the randomizer selects a task which lies beyond one or more marked-up tasks you do the marked up task(s) before you do the selected task.<br><br>***Method 2***<br><br>You have three separate sections to your list, entitled "Must Do", "Should Do" and "Could Do" respectively. Try to keep the Must Do's down to no more than 5 or 6 tasks and the Should Do's to no more than 20.<br><br>You proceed through the list as a whole by setting the randomizer to a range of 1-6 (or you can use a die). You always start the "throw" from the first "live" task and only count "live" tasks.<br><br>Unfinished tasks are re-entered in the section they came from.<br><br>New tasks go in the "Could Do" section unless they really need to be done that day. Reprioritise tasks at the beginning of each day.<br><br>This way the Must Do's will get done very quickly, the Should Do's reasonably quickly and the Could Do's more slowly but still eventually.</div>

<div class="content">Yes, somehow highlight the things that really need to get done before your trip.<br><br>I used to start each week with an overall review of the entire list, pulling out things that needed attention this week. I need to get back into that habit. It worked. It helped to know how busy the week was likely to be. Doing all the MITs up front on an average week leaves three voice practice on the same day. Singing Monday and Tuesday on a busy week leaves not enough time for the MITs.<br><br>Nicole, It sounds like the group as a whole is critical, even if nothing in it is critical -- when taken out of context.<br><br>Maybe add a task "Pick anything from group A" or "Get group A down to one task per remaining day".<br><br>Mark, If I have several marked tasks in a row, Method 1 won't allow any flexibility. I was planning something similar to Method 2, but using Covey's quadrants. Always start counting in Q1. Not sure how to allow reasonable shifting between quadrants. Need to balance focus on Q1 with the possibility of getting something in a different quadrant.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Cricket<br>If you're diligent working Quadrant 2 jobs, then there will be very few Q1 other than same day surprise work. Also doing that way allows for more flexibility because you're rarely under the gun unless that's the type of career you chose.  At home, the only Q1 might be preparing dinner after you get off of work.  My dad taught me this but didn't call it quadrants.  He used to simply advise to keep ahead when possible to allow for the unexpected. He said the world doesn't revolve around my schedule or suppositions. LOL! It really offers more flexibility and taking unexpected stuff in stride.  I know that I sometimes low ball a project's work time, sometimes by a LOT.  It's nice to have the extra time in case things go pear-shaped or an unexpected opportunity appears.  You should avoid Quadrant 1 as much as possible unless it's created by influential others.  LOL!  Pssst....due diligence in quadrant 2 also allows guiltless leisure time. pssst...I don't like wasting time in quadrants 3 or 4.  I prefer pure, untainted goof off time rather than fuss with appearing busy. LOL!</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>You stated:<br>"Singing Monday and Tuesday on a busy week leaves not enough time for the MITs."<br><br>I'd suggest that singing is an MIT, more so than you'd think. Ironically , when you make time for your passions, it buoys up your overall spirits and it also turns you into a ruthless prioritizer, yeah? Let the email, voice mail, snail mail, filing and dishes wait until your lessons are over. The earth will stay on it's axis and the sun will rise again tomorrow.</div>

Once you have completed one task from Q1 you have a 1 in 3 chance of drawing a task from Q2. Once you've completed 2 tasks from Q1 you have an even chance of a task from Q2. And so on.<br><br>That's assuming you are not adding any new "urgent/important" tasks during the day of course.</div>

<div class="content">I've put my rule into effect, highlighting time-critical tasks, and "sliding" across everything else until they are all gone.   It worked brilliantly today.   Time will uncover the shortcomings of this approach, I am sure, but so far I really like it.<br><br>@Learning - I don't really want to use this for "MITs", but only for things that are time-critical.  In other words, if I take too long to finish something, it will have very bad consequences.   <br><br>For example, today I highlighted:<br>- a major presentation with a tight deadline<br>- clearing my email<br>- checking my calendar for next week<br>- a handful of emails from my manager that need a timely response<br><br>If any of these were delayed, they would cause problems: <br>- a missed deadline <br>- a giant email backlog (and time-sensitive emails being missed)<br>- lack of preparation for next week's meetings<br>- creating problems for my manager because of my delay<br><br>I had very little discretionary time today, but these all were addressed easily and without resistance (because of the randomizer), and other things were passed over (because of the highlight rule).<br><br>Now the temptation, of course, is to highlight everything!!    Whatever happens to feel important or especially interesting.   I actually did that by mistake.   When the randomizer landed on them, however, I knew they weren't really PRESSING and I shouldn't spend time on them today, even though they are important.   So I unhighlighted them, and moved on.</div>

<div class="content">Another way to say the same thing:   The Randomizer clears things out pretty quickly all by itself - including MITs.   But if something is really time sensitive, and needs action TODAY or TOMORROW, Randomizer needs a little help.  The highlighter worked great for this today.</div>

<div class="content">Another method:<br><br>Mark up tasks that you must work on.<br><br>Process the list as normal, except that when you throw a number which would take you past a marked-up task, you land on the marked-up task instead. <br><br>When you don't finish a marked-up task, re-enter it at the end of the list still marked-up.<br><br>If this rule would result in doing the same task twice in a row, then skip it until the next pass.<br><br>CAUTION: Keep the number of marked up tasks to an absolute minimum.</div>

<div class="meta">2014-02-21 13:07</div>
<div class="content">Hi Mark<br>Agreed. <br><br>Hi Seraphim<br>Most Important things means exactly that.  I keep a sheet of deadlines. The beauty of that is using Mark's principle of little and often.  Rather than waiting for something to be time critical in the very near future, little and often allows you to get familiar, experiment and make decisions along the way.  Every job is not predictable. Many a time I have low balled my predictions of how long the job will take.  Even if it's a highly dreaded job and you do very little but very often, you'll at least have a head start on the progress made and a real familiarity of the project/job. IOW, once time tells you to begin, you'll have a lot less to do to finish it. In Mark's little and often principle, you get a peek into what's entailed, exposure to possible snags, possible real progress. You won't be approaching it blind and you'll have much less to do to actually finish the thing  hopefully well before deadline.<br><br>OTOH, I do understand the propensity to make too many jobs important NOW.  You want them all done.  To help handle that, I place appointments and same day stuff at the top.  Hopefully, you won't have any same day deadlines unless it came out of left field vs you sitting on it.  I leave a few spaces if things are currently hot involving communications that might force a change of plans today.  I draw a line.  Then I choose a few things that have upcoming deadlines or  bigger projects with a longer term deadline for little and often. I might sprinkle in a few one offs or recurring to keep things current enough overall.<br><br>Sometimes I do Veghead Jone's idea of rotating yesterday's list with today's MIT's especially if I didn't tie up all the loose ends from yesterday. (That's my recurring weakness.)  I haven't had time this week to try his idea of periodically doing a few rotations of the general list.  I've only had time to keep to my weekly projections.  The weekly sheet helps immensely to create the day's will-do list.  I know what I want to accomplish for the week.  On the day's MIT's I can choose what "enough progress today" means. If things go better than I predicted for the day, I can whip out the weekly list and choose something to get ahead on.  Even if unexpected bombs keep detonating and some go off, at least you know that you've chosen the best things to work on.  It's nice when things aren't so tight.  That's the time to choose a new project or two.  It's always exciting to choose a new current initiative or a project that you like or at least don't hate.  LOL!  It's also a great time to get all the maintenance stuff like finances or emails a bit ahead.<br>There's always too much to do and lots of projects you want to start.  It is difficult to choose which ones.  When things aren't so hectic, I like to keep a few projects open to have interest and variety in the mix of work to do. Mark's current initiative principle is genius.  Even if things are horribly busy or you feel sick or lazy, the CI will make progress daily without fail.  If you keep to Mark's principles, you'll find more and more flexibility and wiggle room in your work weeks.<br><br>I do deviate from strict DIT in these ways.  There's too much incoming to place it all the WILL DO list daily.  I'd rather choose where I place my focus and efforts just in case things get really wild. I bundle that stuff and choose what's important.  When there's a lull, then I can handle the less stuff with less impact.  After awhile you'll get better at choosing what to put on your WILL DO list.  You'll also get more effective in choosing other work for consideration.  Like Mark's MUST, SHOULD and COULD, your MIT is usually very few MUSTS if you get good at choosing SHOULDS if you embrace Mark's little and often principle.  To me, the lynch pin of making DIT work is sticking to WILL DO.  That is usually SHOULDS that never get to MUST DO TODAY status. They are early MUST DOs.  Most of the time, you'll finish the WILL DO list in time to work on things you want to consider.  I try to keep my MITs (WILL DO LIST) down to about 2-4 hours.  Even though it doesn't always work out that way, most of the time there's enough flexibility to keep up with little and often, one offs and recurring stuff.  THEN,....you get to choose one or two things from your project queue or it's time to choose another CI.  I try to save the CI slot for a project that I WANT to do. I might have another project or two that I treat as CIs if they are hard projects that have high resistance.  Little and often truly helps. The over-riding principles of DIT are flawless and strong.  You can change the rule sets or just work flexibly within the principles to have a good work flow.  I prefer to choose my MITs because I can't do every little thing every day. Also, I don't want to consider certain work a backlog within 4 days.  Others can easily pull it off.  I need to prioritize for what I WILL DO WITHOUT FAIL. Trust me, after awhile of working the WILL DO list, you'll get much more selective of what you put on it.  LOL!</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>Bear in mind that nobody is a 100% efficiency machine who has no bias at all about choosing and approaching their work.  Plus they can't always accurately predict what happens in the day.  That's why you should carefully choose your MITs and relief tasks to help you stay on course overall even with the other factors influencing your work pace.  My greatest challenge is my attitude and my body.  That's what usually drops a spanner in my running engine.  LOL!  The success of my day depends highly on work arounds to keep me willing to start.  Mark pretty much nailed the principles and many of the effective work arounds.  The forum posters have also greatly contributed to work arounds. Good luck!</div>

<div class="content">Mark:  One advantage of my highlighting method is it preserves random selection (amongst the highlighted tasks) rather than forcing action in a sequence (which all three of your proposals for handling urgency appear to do).   I tend to resist being forced to do things in order, but for whatever reason, am totally happy doing things in random order!   LOL<br><br>Also, the highlight method is very simple, does not require pre-planning or categorization (beyond the decision to highlight or not), and easily self-corrects (it becomes obvious if you've highlighted a task that isn't really as urgent as you thought it was - the other REALLY urgent tasks pull your attention away from the faux-urgent ones).<br><br>And your comments about prioritization are spot-on, of course.</div>

<div class="content">Learning:   Yes, I prefer using little-and-often for completing MITs, especially when "little" means repeated sessions of 90+ minutes focus time.   But sometimes the time pressure forces me to act sooner.   E.g., new urgent project from my manager due in 2-3 days.   It doesn't work to throw it on the list with everything else.<br><br>Another good example:  I get an email which triggers a 20-minute task due end-of-day today.   Happens all the time.   I used to just keep that in my inbox and work on it as soon as I was done with my email.   Or I'd add to my task list with a reminder popping up every 15 minutes.   Both of these approaches would totally interrupt my flow - these tasks always felt like annoying interruptions.   By highlighting them in my Randomizer list, I just process them as normal and they get done quickly.   At least, that's what happened yesterday.  :-)</div>

<div class="content">I started the day with the intent to pick a dividing line between Q1 and Q2, and work accordingly. Now I'm thinking I should let Q1 stay small, and let Randomizer work its magic in Q2. Is there such a thing as Q1-1/2, for things that will become Q1 in a few days? Then Q1-1/4 and Q1-3/4...<br><br>Learning, Most of my work is in Q2. Often there is no deadline. If there is a deadline, I front-load the schedule. I can't work late at night and as work becomes urgent I stall until I can't ignore it. Dad used to go on and on about young coworkers who missed deadlines, not because of the expensive, hard-to-source parts, but because of the every-day "632 screws" that you can only buy when the local hardware store is open.<br><br>Yes, I do have Q1 moments. (Groceries, cooking supper - need discipline to use the slow-cooker, things that will just take few moments, things that hit the "danger zone" between happily working ahead and OMG I'm almost late!<br><br>Q2 tasks with deadlines aren't a problem for me. It's the Q2 tasks that don't have deadlines that I have trouble with, such as back-filing and cleaning. I can let it go one more day, then one day I realize it's disgusting. Randomizer helped a lot with those.<br><br>One of the reasons I take voice exams is to keep the pressure on. Until the exam in mid-June, practicing is an MIT. Most of the year, though, practicing feels optional. (Just realized. The exam is in June, and I'm definitely in the MIT zone.

"What's urgent today?" I also get several crossed-off tasks (i.e., often hit a slide).

We've got two methods under discussion. 1) Group them on a separate list and randomize within that group (with possibility of rolling off it). 2) Leave them in place on the big list, marked, count non-highlighted and slide to marked.<br><br>May as well add a 3rd.

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br><< forcing action in sequence which all three of your proposals for handling urgency appear to do. >><br><br>If you think that, then you need to read them again!<br><br>Method One interleaves marked-up tasks with non-marked up tasks. Ok, the marked up tasks are in sequence with each other and they sometimes will follow each other, but exactly when they happen is up to the randomizer.<br><br>Method Two mixes "Must Do" with "Should Do" tasks and later "Should Do" with "Could Do" tasks. It does not force any of them to be in a pre-determined sequence.<br><br>Method Three also interleaves normal tasks with marked-up tasks. If you have a lot of unfinished marked-up tasks (which I advise against), you may get a pre-determined sequence at the end of the list but this will consist of tasks you have already started, so less resistance.<br><br>Only Method Three requires pre-categorizing.<br><br>The main problem I have with your method is that you start off with a collection of "difficult" tasks and have to finish them before you are allowed to have any contact with easier tasks. All three of my methods mix some easier tasks with the difficult ones.</div>

<div class="content">Mark, you are right, I misunderstood your three methods.   I read through them again before I posted, but seem to have missed something.  I will take a closer look.<br><br>My highlight method does not start off with a set of difficult tasks - just time-sensitive ones.   Maybe they are difficult, maybe not.   For example, I include "email triage" on there, because if I fail to clear my email twice a day, it becomes a backlog problem pretty quickly.   And email triage is always kinda fun, especially with Mailbox.   <br><br>I also put requests from my wife, like "order diapers on Amazon".  It's an easy break from the harder stuff, but it's still urgent.   My wife will be very unhappy if I let it sit for too long.  :-)</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br><< Hm, here's an idea for a new general rule: If your task has a hard deadline, highlight it. Use the Randomizer as usual, but slide through all other tasks till ALL your highlighted tasks are completed. If your highlighted task is "done enough for today", then you can move it to the Tomorrow page, and highlight it again. It will then be off your active list, and wait till Tomorrow for you to take further action on it. >><br><br>I want to try this out with my randomizer system, but I have one question. How do you handle it when you have only one highlighted task and it's too long to finish in one go? According to your rules, you would keep sliding to the same task - which would effectively mean you would be doing it in one go whether you liked it or not.</div>

<div class="content">Good question, Mark.  I haven't run into that situation, but I suppose I could try one of these approaches:<br><br>(1) Count it as "done enough for today" and re-enter as highlighted for tomorrow<br><br>(2) Count it as "done enough for today, but if I find some time, I'd like to work some more today" and re-enter today unhighlighted AND tomorrow as highlighted<br><br>(3) Break it down further:  what do I need to really do today?  Enter that today, with highlight.  Enter the rest for tomorrow, with highlight if appropriate.<br><br>(4) Decide to "take a break" and do a round through the list paying no attention to whether things are highlighted - something like your Method 1 (above).<br><br>If you do try it, I'd love to hear your feedback and if you have any of your own suggestions for this situation.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark - I'd be very interested to know how this highlight approach has been working out for you.   I've been using it the last few days and it's been going quite well.  But people at work are starting to wonder why I've got a green 20-sided die on my desk.  :-)</div>

<div class="content">One thing I've noticed about myself is that time pressure increases resistance for me until it gets to a critical point. Other factors contribute to resistance, too, but as soon as I "highlight" something, I find I don't want to do it.</div>

<div class="content">My own answer to handling urgent items in my admittedly short time of using the system is to just accept the randomizer as NOT a way to handle urgent tasks, then use the principle of structured procrastination ( <a href="http://www.structuredprocrastination.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.structuredprocrastination.com/</a> ).<br><br>I maintain in my smartphone two lists: the Randomizer list and the Urgent list.  The tasks in the Urgent list must have real hard deadlines, and the tasks are arranged by a rough approximation of priority based on deadlines and difficulty to do.  So based on that I mark the most important to do today.  Then I pick a Randomizer task.  So which one do I want to do more?  I then do the task I choose, then pick the next task from the list that I got that task, then compare again.<br><br>So basically you get from the Randomizer a random thing to do, then get from the Urgent list the one you most need to do, then choose from the two.<br><br>Easy.</div>

<div class="content">Of course if you want to do this randomly just get a coin and toss between the Urgent and Random tasks :p</div>

<div class="content">Hi All<br>I just finished for another week.  I didn't have any self created urgent tasks.  Everything got done well before urgent except tasks that were either same day urgent because it couldn't be controlled by me like call backs.  The randomizer really helps when I need assistance to start necessary work early enough so that it never reaches same day urgency status.  I've always been pretty conscientious about that but the randomizer really makes little and often easier to do on dreaded work.<br><br>Veghead's yesterday rotation helped me.  When I went to finish it up today, I forgot that I already did most of it.  Nice surprise!  I still need to strengthen my use of the general list more often. I've been trained for decades to just use my weekly list.  When I tried veghead's general list rotation, I found myself doing a little bit of extra work that wasn't on this week's map.  It also helped me become more familiar with my overall workload.  Again, thanks veghead jones.  I'll stay with this because I want to learn this option better.  <br><br>Veghead Jones ~  How has it been working for you?  Have you made any modifications yet?  My only modification has been creating smaller lists and using stricter rules when I need to tighten my focus and resolve or my time is limited.  Otherwise, I'm still focusing on learning your tweaks. They aren't hardened yet but, so far, I really feel the benefits of the tweaks that you taught us.  The randomizer and your tweaks helps to conserve my mental energy and helps to give me assurance that I'll be less prone to leave loose ends. So far, this has been great. Thanks!</div>

<div class="content">How about taking advantage that Randomizer has a slight bias for older entries?<br><br>If you put ordinary tasks to the right side of the notebook and urgent items on the left side, then the oldest pages become "super pages" that are up to twice the size. Because of this, the urgent items would be processed more often. Also, by placing even undoable urgent items into the urgent pages (for example tasks that cannot be started on before a certain date) the slide rule can be used on them to add even more bias on the other urgent items.</div>

<div class="content">nuntym:<br><br><< How about taking advantage that Randomizer has a slight bias for older entries? >><br><br>Sorry, only just came across this post of yours while looking for something else. Only 5 years late!<br><br>The Randomizer only has a bias for older entries because more and more tasks get deleted and the sliding effect comes more and more into effect. Without sliding, there would be no bias for older pages. Since your left-hand pages would be all-new tasks, sliding wouldn't happen and the odds would be the same as a new page at the end of the list.</div>
