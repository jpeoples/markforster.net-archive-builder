<div class="content">I'm using three spiral notebooks - one for work, one for home and one for the massive project of cleaning up my basement. I am no where near filling up any of my notebooks but I was curious if anyone (especially Mark) has filled a notebook. How do we make the transition from one notebook to the next. Or should I be using binders instead.<br><br>I love the system and it is working well for me so far I was just wondering if another type of notebook would be better.</div>

<div class="content">This probably results in a rewrite of all open task when switching to a new notebook, or you have to use both notebooks for the transitional period. <br><br>I bought an Atoma notebook today, which lets you remove pages and insert refills. In the US, Circa/Rollabind offer similar notebooks. I don't know about the UK, but there were some rather cheap notebooks mentioned in a forum thread that offer the same system.</div>

<div class="content">Donna,<br><br>You have a choice between using both the old and new notebooks until everything is finished in the old one (which is what I think I will probably do), or alternatively transferring all open items to the new notebook. If you do that, be careful to maintain the page structure. So, if there are two items on the first open page, transfer both items to the new notebook and draw a line right across the page to signify that the two items represent one page. If you try to consolidate all the items into a new page structure you will mess up the system.</div>

<div class="content">You can buy "file folder rubber bands" or "file bands"<br>to keep the notebooks together for travel.<br><br>What do you mean page structure?  Is it:<br><br>item listed<br>item listed<br>item listed<br>__________________________________________<br>item listed<br>__________________________________________<br>item listed<br>item listed<br><br>Where the first three items above were on page 1 of the <br>original notebook, the next item on page 2, the last 2 items <br>on page 3?<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Bob<br></div>
