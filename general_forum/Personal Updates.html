<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-12-24 10:46</div>
<div class="content">For those of you concerned about Christine, I emailed her a few days ago to ask how she was and so far have had no reply. This morning I tried calling her on her cellphone (the only number I have) and it just rang out. I've now sent her a text message, wishing her Happy Christmas from all of us and asking how she is. I'll let you know if and when I get a reply. The only other way of contacting her I know of is on her Facebook page, which she hasn't posted anything on since August.</div>

<div class="content">I'm going to be taking a few days off over Christmas, so don't expect to see any contributions from me until Sunday evening (UK time) at the earliest. With very best wishes for Christmas to all who read this forum.</div>

<div class="content">Mark, maybe you should post something on her Facebook page and any friends or family who see her regularly will respond to you. Hope you had a lovely Christmas!</div>

<div class="content">Just received this email from Christine:<br><br>Hi Mark <br><br>Thank you so much for your concern – have just seen your message posted to Facebook on my email. <br><br>I am fine (well sort of!) now but it has been an “interesting” couple of months.  You may recall that I was having some health issues; well they got significantly worse and unfortunately the hospital took an inordinate amount of time to reach a correct (or hopefully now correct) diagnosis.  Whereas they initially said that I had the start of osteoarthritis they have now concluded that it is my body’s own immune system which is attacking my joints so have put me on some pretty heavy duty medication to suppress my immune system.  Great!! It has not yet kicked in to any great degree that I can tell but the pain is being managed to a pretty fair degree now with a cortisone injection & anti-inflammatory meds although I am constantly tired.  On the up side – pain is a great appetite suppressant – I’ve lost about two stone! <br><br>By September I was struggling to write or even type much so switched my PC off to give it a rest (I usually keep it on most of the time).  That was a big mistake!  After that it never worked again!  My motherboard was fried and too expensive to repair.  I have extracted the hard drive so have all my data and am just now getting back up and running again.  The worst is resetting email accounts – I have just about completed that for all but two accounts but have had to “declare a backlog”...... about 3 – 4 months worth!!  Interestingly enough being offline was quite freeing – for the first couple of weeks I had major PC withdrawal symptoms but it made me realise how much time I normally spend online.  I haven’t accessed the forum for about three months – somehow I suspect I won’t catch up L  – but am looking forward to getting back.  I have had to completely rethink my “communication”.  Being unable to write much restricted my Christmas Card sending, being offline for email made me pretty inaccessible and as I could rarely get to the phone before it went to voicemail was constantly getting complaints of my mailbox being full.  I have had new phones for Christmas so that should not be a problem going forward – I should have enough phones now to be close enough to one at least!  I have also changed my mobile package and should now be able to text! <br><br>As you can imagine it has been quite a frustrating time.  I have so much respect for Vicky who seems to keep going in a far worse situation and I feel a real wimp sometimes.  Still I am determined to beat this and am taking each day at a time.  There are definitely upsides – I actually enjoyed Christmas shopping using Sainsbury’s and Tesco’s mobility scooters!  Not sure the other shoppers did though! <br><br>I really appreciate your concern Mark and please pass my best regards to everyone on the forum – I do hope to be back soon but my typing is still fairly restricted. <br><br>I do wish you all the very best for 2010 and thanks again Mark<br><br>Love Christine</div>

<div class="content">Christine, it might be a while before you get to read this, but just wanted you to know I have been thinking of you every time I visited the forum, you have been much missed by many it seems. Also how glad I am that things are now improving for you.<br><br>Regarding the auto-immune disease, I have lupus and have found Udo's Oil invaluable for reducing joint pain - it's available at all good health food shops in the fridge, and I take two tablespoons daily. I have found it much more effective than Cod Liver Oil alone so perhaps worth a try.<br><br>Best wishes for a continuing recovery (for you and your computer!)<br><br>Love B(ella)</div>

<div class="content">(((Christine)))<br>Chin up, girlie!  We CAN do this!  I'm betting  on you to this to see yourself through this!  Prove me right!

<div class="content">I am so relieved you got an email from her. Thanks, Mark! <br><br>Christine, I will be praying for you. Drop us another line when you can! A two-week vacation from the computer? I'm getting the shakes just thinking about it.</div>

<div class="content">I am grateful we have heard from Christine and wish her a fast recovery. I've been away from the forum for a few days, since I started the new year with a nice case of mushroom poisoning. New years never agree with me.<br><br>Vp:<br><br>How nice of you to tell us about the blog you created--err--'found'. I also like how you took it on you to spam--err--inform us on several threads about it, including this one where everyone is worried about Christine's health. How very sensitive.</div>

<div class="content">Vp:<br><br>The link you posted still has the same three articles it had when you posted it (which all were created shortly before you posted the link, as was the site itself). You can see the history of the page if you click on 'profile'.</div>
