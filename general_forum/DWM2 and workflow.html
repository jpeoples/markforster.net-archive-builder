<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">hi all,<br><br>First, I appreciate all the great experience on the board.  I don't post much but read a lot.<br><br>To the issue:  I've been drawn to DWM2 for a couple reasons.  However, I am curious about the workflow that is used when moving through the list.  <br><br>I come in for a 'new day', do I start with the last open page, with the current page, the last page I worked/stopped at or start with the newest date (assuming the new day starts mid page)?  Once I finish WHATEVER page I start with, do I then move forward or go back to the last unfinished page, etc?<br><br>I would really appreciate some feedback on how those of you who use/d DWM2 work through your lists.<br><br>Sorry if this has been answered but I read most of the DWM2 threads and didn't specifically see it.<br><br>thanks,<br><br>brett<br><br>In oth</div>

<div class="content">Your question might be answered in this thread (DWM)<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2010/2/1/dit2-af5-who-cares-what-its-called-this-is-what-im-working-o.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2010/2/1/dit2-af5-who-cares-what-its-called-this-is-what-im-working-o.html</a><br><br><br><br><< Does it matter which end of the list you start from? In AF1 you always start from the earliest; in AF2 you always start from the latest; in DIT it doesn't matter. Do you think it matters with this model? >><br>In para 5, I say just treat all the active pages (i.e. all pages from today to one month's time inclusive) as one list which you circulate around. So you just start again from where you left off. <br>February 1, 2010 at 15:20 | Mark Forster <br><br><br>I usually do as advised here, but I don't think it really matters, as long as you keep a moderate speed cycling through the list.<br><br>Enjoy DWM2!</div>

<div class="content">Yes I am. I like it very much. I came back to it after a long -and satisfactory- experience with SF (great system as well). <br>I believe DWM2 is a bit (just a bit) more flexible.</div>

<div class="content">Cool.  How do you handle urgent tasks?  Do you use a second column like in SF?<br><br>Any other advice you have would be welcome.<br><br>Brett</div>

<div class="content">+JMJ+<br><br>Ahh, so good to be back! ^___^<br><br>Hi brettypooh!<br><br>What I like about DWM2 is that it is very flexible, as Paco-pepe said.  You see, since this system's dismissal process is not work-based (whether you worked on a section or not) but time-based (how long has a section been there), then you can work on the system however you like.<br><br>If you want to work on the list in a leisurely manner, use AF1-style processing.<br><br>If you want to work on the more urgent tasks of the list, use AF2-style processing.<br><br>If you want to work halfway, use Ping-Pong: work the list AF1 style until an urgent task or tasks come up, then go to those tasks, then return to where you were.<br><br>It's that simple ^___^</div>

<div class="content">@Brett<br><br>I just put them at the end of the list. The system allows you to jump to them when you feel the urge. DWM2 is a *one* long list processed following the standing out rule; and, as nuntym says, the time based dismissal process gives you that freedom.</div>

<div class="content">@Brett<br>>Any other advice you have would be welcome.<br><br><br>some tips<br><br>• Move a sticker around the list indicating where you are.<br>• Try to be fast cycling through the list<br>• Feeling a bit tyred? Slowing speed of work? Time to move to the next task<br>• Work on the task that really "stands out"<br>• Focus your attention on your work and not on the method<br>• Keep strict rules for task dimissal and keep your list short. You can always go back dismissed tasks later.</div>

<div class="content">hi all,<br><br>I've been using DWM2 for several weeks now.  I can honestly say that it is the system that makes the most sense to me.  I use it in conjunction with a project folder wtih all my notes for projects that I cycle through to update my DWM2 on a regular basis.<br><br>What I like most about DWM2 is the time based dismissal and the fact that I know the date I assigned someone something, etc.  It just works for me.<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Brett</div>
