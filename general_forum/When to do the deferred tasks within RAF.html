<div class="content">So, quick question, if have a few tasks deferred to today. They sit in my calendar as tasks scheduled for today. Now what? When do I do them?<br><br>Do I re-enter them to the list?<br>Do I have a daily recurring task "clear calendar"?<br>Do I just work on them first thing in the morning?<br><br>It is better to do them before dong the "DDD - round" or afterwards?<br><br>What technique do I use to make sure I work on those tasks today?</div>

Otherwise just treat them like any other task on the list.<br><br><< What technique do I use to make sure I work on those tasks today? >><br><br>Just do them.</div>

<div class="content">A hack I'm employing for things I want to do but no particular time or day: I have my notebook and whenever I defer such a task, I write it on a new blank page.<br><br>Eventually I will fill up a page normally and the next page magically has 1 new task to pick up.  It nicely spaces out all these fuzzy tasks so I don't have many of them at once.  Consequently, some of these have been deferred quite some time into the future.  Out of consideration for a while.<br><br>This is not treated as a rule, just a handy way of placing this deferment.</div>

<div class="content">Alan Baljeu:<br><br>I did something very similar. But instead of only writing one task per page I would write each day's deferred tasks one per page regardless of whether there were any deferred tasks on the pages from previous days. That way I got a bit of overlap, but the tasks didn't stretch too far into the future.</div>

<div class="content">So far I'm amazed that I haven't had to defer very much at all. I defer to a tickler file instead of a calendar. The future-pages hack seems pretty good, but could lead to a heavy feeling if there are a lot of items stacking up. There's something about having to take a task out of the system, and then put it back in, that feels different and, in my case, makes me more likely to just delete it instead of deferring.<br><br>I wonder if, by training myself with the various 'no-list' techniques (SMEMA, 5T, etc.) over the last couple years, I now trust that a lot of important but not critical tasks will come to mind naturally, so it's not imperative to keep them on the list or defer to a later date. For example, I just deleted "file papers" and "back up personal email archives" - two home tasks that I cannot do now at work. In the past, I would've certainly deferred them. But I know I will think about these again soon - the stack of papers to file is right there on my desk, and the un-backed-up email folders are right there in the sidebar when I check or zero my Inbox.</div>
