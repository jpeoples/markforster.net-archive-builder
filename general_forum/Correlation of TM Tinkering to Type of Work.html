<div class="content">Hi Seraphim<br>I'm a dyed in the wool natural tinkerer with almost everything. But once I feel that I've got something working to my satisfaction, I stop and start tinkering with something else.  LOL!  Obsessive tinkering can be a lot of fun but it can also be a PITA.  Some people think it's being perfectionistic.  I think it's more about enjoying a challenge.</div>

<div class="content">These are the main differences I noticed between the people who answered YES and the people who answered NO to the following question:<br><br>QUESTION = Do you frequently try new time management techniques and methods:<br><br>YES  --  NO   --<br>30%  --  50%  --  in job involving operations / keep the business running<br>45%  --  25%  --  in job involving Process Improvement<br>45%  --  25%  --  in job involving "people work"<br><br>Only 4 people answered NO, and 29 answered YES, and they are all readers of this site, so it's definitely not a scientific survey.  :-)</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim et al:<br><br>This raises an interesting question.<br><br>I see myself as the equivalent in the time management world of someone who designs new car engines in the automotive world.<br><br>Someone who designs new car engines thinks, breathes and lives possible new developments in car engines.<br><br>However the person who is just an ordinary car driver would be acting rather oddly if they were to keep taking their car engine out and redesigning it every few weeks or months. They'd leave it for several years before they decided it was time to buy a new car and take advantage of advances in engine design. But apart from that they would just get on with driving their car, and if it wasn't quite as fast as they'd like, then so what?</div>
