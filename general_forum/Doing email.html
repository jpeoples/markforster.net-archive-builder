<div class="content">When"doing" a batch of mail, I am usually scanning each item filing it and adjusting my "will-do" list.<br><br>So I would not normally reply until two days after I receive a mail. <br><br>Does anyone make a habit of responding as part of "doing"?  Does this work for you?<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Will</div>

<div class="content">I knock out the whole batch in one go. If it's something that requires addional action, I just print it out and throw it in my paper inbox. Then I action it when I go through my paper. If there are many steps involved, I turn it into a project.</div>

<div class="content">I always respond (if a response is neccessary) as part of "doing" the batch of emails, even if it's just to acknowledge and let them know I will be following up the email within an appropriate timescale. If it's something very quick I will close it out there and then (e.g. if someone wants to know a deadline on a project I am running I have the information at my fingertips, so can let them know straight away. I feel that communication is vitally important, and the easier way to keep people happy. I then add any outstanding actions to the "will-do" list.</div>

<div class="content">I agree with Catherine and Pat.The way I advise is to fully action the email as an email, i.e. read, reply, file, etc. Any further action resulting from the email gets dealt with as a project/task or, if I've printed out an attachment, as paper. <br>Mark</div>

<div class="content">I had the same question about "doing email".  I read, reply, archive as part of doing. But anything that needs follow-on action I -(a) look at my diary for when I could get it done; (b) enter it in the task list for that day; (c) set a follow-up flag on the email for the corresponding day; and (d) move it out of my inbox into a folder called "Processed for action".  This way my inbox gets "done" when I "do" my email and I can also bring up a complete follow-up list on Lotus Notes that links me to the email by one click.  Once it has been actioned I remove the flag (so it goes from the follow-up list) and archive it.  It took me a day or two to work this out but it seems to make sense to me now and works well.</div>

<div class="content">Sorry I forgot one other thing - I would commend people to look at an electronic way that works for them (like what works for me), rather than printing out emails just so you can action them.  Most email applications (even Hotmail and Yahoo) allow you to create folders and flag emails.  Reducing paper usage and power consumption from printing is good for the environment - as we all know.</div>

<div class="content">When I batch process my email I always use a countdown timer. If I can reply and action something within the time I have available I do it, I normally spend 30 mins a day on batch processing email. If it requires more action than I have time for, I place it in an @Action folder and create a task in my task diary for the next day to action the item. Once actioned I file it as normal.<br><br>I also have an @@Today folder, which I use to just copy the contents of my inbox into as I process. So I don't get caught up with anything new coming in.<br><br>All the best<br><br>Steve</div>
