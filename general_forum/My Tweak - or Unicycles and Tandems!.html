<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-05-4 16:58</div>
<div class="content">This tweak arose out of the fact that I had over 50 active active pages, very erratic discretionery time, frequent issues with deadline driven tasks and a need to "blitz" certain backlog issues.  This tweak has allowed me to address those scenarios whilst retaining what I feel to be the "true spirit" of Autofocus.  There are basically two elements to my approach - <br><br>1) The Last Pages Group<br>and<br>2) Dual Cycling<br><br>LAST PAGES GROUP<br>With so many pages I found that, by the time I neared the end of my lists, I could have several totally unstarted pages, which meant that I would need to spend a lot of time at the end of the lists before returning to the beginning.  At this point I decided to try grouping these last pages as a batch, and allowed myself to work any items (still using the standing out process) within those pages.  That dealt with the issues of dependant tasks within those pages, deadlined tasks, urgent new tasks, and multiple project tasks.  I have never liked the "just do it" rule as it always felt like cheating and this approach incorporated those tasks into the system.<br><br>DUAL CYCLING<br>At the same time as starting work on the "Last Pages Group" I simultaneously restarted cycling through my pages from the beginning.  There was no pressure to move at any particular speed because I did not have the worry about "new" items.  This meant that I was working on the lists in the normal way AND on the last pages.<br><br>RULES<br>For the "normal" cycling it is important to work the lists in the normal way, i.e. moving through the pages in order, actioning tasks and dismissing as appropriate.<br><br>For the Last Pages Group, it is important that the first pages of the group are regularly "closed", or moved on from, otherwise the group will eventually become the whole list.  For example, if the Group is pages 73 to 75, once you are sure that no further tasks are standing out on page 73, the Group becomes pages 74 to 75, or 76 etc., until you reach the end in the normal way.<br><br>You can switch between your normal cycle page and the Last Pages Group AT ANY TIME, in other words "whenever you feel like it".  This adds an element of structured procrastination.  If you have "must do" or "deadlined" tasks within the Last Pages Group, then boredom and resistance can be higher.  The ability to leave the page KNOWING YOU CAN RETURN enables you to take a break whilst still working the lists.  Similarly if you hit an early page with a few items with high resistance, being able to switch for a period of time gives you a breathing space to make the "do or dismiss" decision.<br><br>I have found that dealing with "urgent" items has been easier, and I have found it easier to action or dismiss earlier items.  I am far more relaxed about a high number of pages and my number of active tasks has continued to decrease, despite consistently adding new items.<br><br>As for what happens when the two cycles catch up?  At that point I will choose whether to revert to a Unicycle or continue with my Tandem, depending on the current scenario.  If at any point whilst "Unicycling" I am presented with a batch of urgent must do tasks, I can add them to the end of the list and switch to Tandem Mode!  I guess I have to call this Unicycle Mode vs Tandem Mode :-)<br><br>Hope my description makes sense - you know how good I am at being concise (not!)</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for sharing,  it looks like a simple (concise :) solution to a recurrent problem</div>

<div class="content">Christine:<br><br>Thanks for sharing. Would it be simpler just to treat the current active page and the last (say) three pages as a unit?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark<br><br>I think it may well be simpler but I also think there is a subtle psychological effect that could be lost.  It is important to cycle on with the active pages and I think treating it as part of the unit could compromise that.  <br><br>Say for example I do a task on Page 16, and move on to Page 17 which has three items, two of which I would be happy to dismiss and one which I am not sure of, perhaps I still feel I "ought" to do it despite resistance.  If I don't feel ready to make that decision I can switch to "the group".  However if it just becomes part of a unit with pages 74 to 76, then I may never make that decision, because I can just keep ignoring it.  The backwards and forward motion is important "because" I have to make the decision.  I either work on Page 17 or on "the group".  Until I make the decision on Page 17 I only have "the group" and the only way to escape from resistance on "the group" is by making a decision on Page 17.  If it became part of "the group" there would be nowhere to go when I hit resistance, other than to abandon the lists entirely for a period.</div>

<div class="content">Christine, interesting approach. I think in a sense this is what I have always done in terms of working urgent / due today items. I work back and forth. Because you don't like doing that because of the rules, I can see where this approach serves you well. I think Mark was saying (correct me if I'm wrong Mark) that you could always say that the last 3 pages are a group rather than having the number of pages grouped vary. I don't think he was suggesting to group your last active page (page 17) with your group of last pages on your list.<br><br>Your tweak wouldn't solve the problem I was having--getting through the entire list on a frequent enough basis. My tweak continues to work beautifully for me. One interesting change I am noticing in how I'm working: Because I no longer fear that I won't be hitting the last page for days (what happens when I use original AF), I find that I am using tasks on the last and second to last page to get ahead of the game. For example, I just made photocopies for the class I taught this weekend. It's been re-added to the list for next week. Normally I would focus on wanna-do, frivolous tasks on the last page like, "Look up X website." Instead I am finding myself wanting to get my copies made now for next weekend.<br><br>The other problem that's been solved is that some of the tasks in the middle of the list are now getting done before they become urgent. These are the things that aren't due for a while, so I passed over them. They were getting very little attention using the other methods I've tried.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine and Mel and All,<br><br>This is quite good.  I am intrigued by it and will try.  As I posted earlier, I have been using Nick's "Adaptive Strategy" of starting the day with the oldest page -- and time blocking it (I use the Time Machine, which works well for this) -- and then go to my most recent active page -- work on there -- and then go backwards through the pages.  I have all of my time-sensitive tasks in AF but also in Outlook, so I know I am not going to miss them.  I review the urgency of the time-sensitive tasks first thing in the morning, and then plan my day accordingly.  Perhaps some time blocks on urgent tasks, then back to my AF lists, etc.  It is somewhat similar to what you are presenting here, Christine -- I am just using Outlook for my "Last Pages Group".<br><br>Mel, would you please once again tell me about your tweaks?<br><br>Thanks,<br>-David</div>

<div class="meta">2009-05-4 22:04</div>
<div class="content">Sure, David. Thank you for the Action Machine link by the way. I'm hoping he'll make an IPhone app. He said he's working on AM for the Mac first.<br><br>Someone mentioned here that they thought it made sense to use a task diary ala DIT for AF pages. I really liked that idea of having each page be from a given day. I have my AF list on my IPhone so having too many tasks per page isn't an issue for me practically. I haven't been doing that long enough to see if it presents problems long-term. So far I love having my pages labeled by date. I feel like I'm working on my backlog if that makes sense.<br><br>I tried Nick's adaptation of starting with the first active page, then switching to the last page and moving backward. I liked always including the last page for a variety of reasons, but I felt this method had me neglecting the middle pages. To be fair, I only tried it a few days before I gave it up. I started thinking about my specific needs with the list. 1. I wanted to address the last page every day<br>2. I wanted to get through the whole list every day<br>3. I had a LOT of pages (33)<br><br>I realized that the least crucial items were actually on the first pages of my list. For me, it didn't make sense to start with those. The hot tasks were on the last page and the page before (yesterday). I still like the idea of doing today what arrived on my plate yesterday. So I start with the last page (today's page for me) and move to the next to last page (yesterday's page for me). I then realized that I could cover the whole list (middle and oldest pages) by working every other page. Doing this would have me working every page every two days. Working 17 pages is doable; working 33 is not. <br><br>So far I absolutely love it! I have no anxiety because I know the last page and yesterday's page will be worked every day. If I miss a task that I think needs doing, I realize that I will hit it tomorrow. Yesterday I had enough time left over that I could do some additional tasks on my current page. I have noted before, though, that I'm not sure that this modification is helpful to anyone who doesn't have many pages. The only other caveat might be setting a time limit on working the last page and yesterday's page. Some may find themselves stuck there.<br><br>HTH! By the way, sorry for your losses. You've been in my prayers.</div>

<div class="content">Mel,<br><br>Would it not be about the same to start each day on the last page and simply work backward?  Over time, would the later pages not be closed off and the middle ones dwindle until  you reached the earliest?<br><br>I really see why you have all come to this point.  I came to it a while ago myself.  Almost immediately I adopted the "hot card" tweak ... read the whole list first thing and pick the top items, put them on a card and work those first (or at least, no matter what) then only do the rest of the AF exercise in burst when time permits.<br><br>Why would a system like that not work for you?  Too many "hot" items?  I'm just trying to understand why I'm seeing so many different tweaks that have people moving through the list in all kinds of directions often using rules that change according to the situation.  For me, the real beauty (and I use that term advisedly) of AF is its utter simplicity.  I hated to add my tweak but I had to.  And AF is so simple my tweak almost doubled the rules ;-)</div>

<div class="meta">2009-05-5 0:47</div>
<div class="content">Mike, good question. Part of the answer is in my response to your personality post (I need change to stay motivated). What seems like a silly complication to many may be what keeps me going.<br><br>I have been using a "hot card" of sorts since the beginning. Mine is digital, but I can easily view what needs doing in the next two days and can flip from doing those tasks back to my list. What you're suggesting (start with the last page and move backward) is feasible, but I feel that my tweak is more balanced. If I only work backward and never make it to the end of the list, those middle and older tasks may sit for quite a spell. One of the things I love about AF is the way it can help you action the tasks you've put off for far too long. Using my tweak, I am working the hot items, the tasks that must be done soon (middle pages), and those older tasks that aren't urgent but would give me great satisfaction to do. I was doing what you suggested a little bit by using Nick's method (start with first active, then to last page and backward). It felt a bit like swimming against the current. That may not be founded in reality--I may have gotten to those middle pages sooner than I thought--but it still bothered me.<br><br>Just so you know, I do understand where you're coming from with this. When I hear people talk about using mind mapping software, I think, "Good grief! Just scribble on a notepad!" LOL Funny how I don't feel that way about my AF list.</div>

<div class="content">Christine<br><br>Just out of curiosity, knowing that my understanding of English is sometimes limited: Why is it called 'Unicycle Mode vs Tandem Mode' and not 'Unicycle Mode vs Bicycle Mode' (1 or 2 wheels).  'Bike Mode vs Tandem Mode' (1 or 2 persons) is also possible but does not refer to cycling.<br><br>I think I will take over your approach;  until Mark can convince me to follow the new to come 'no closed lists' heresy,  that sounds promising as it would probably allow thematic (by project) regrouping of tasks.</div>

<div class="content">Mel,<br><br>O.K.  I get you.  Anything that helps keep motivation is a good thing ;-)<br><br>As for the middle tasks, from my perspective they get done if they need to.  My morning review pickups up the most important things.  It functions as a way of prioritizing (horrors ;-)<br><br>In any case, so long as things are getting done, I'm happy enough.<br><br>As to mind mapping, yeah, it can be overkill.  I mostly use it as a thinking tool.  It is more for planning than execution.  A mind map of what needs to be done from the highest level down serves to both prioritize and allow you to see the big picture all at once.  It is different from a list in that you can see how things interrelate and what is important in the WHOLE list jumps out in an instant.  "Do taxes", "Clean Garage", "Get Medical Checkup" are all in a single eye view and it is instantly comprehensible that (for one person) doing the taxes has the highest urgency/priority so needs to get done right now.<br><br>As you say, we are all different.  Mixing up the rules would drive me nuts ... it keeps things fresh for you.  Makes tons of sense to me ;-)<br><br>Thanks for the light bulb. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Damien<br><br>That's a very good question!  It was the Tandem idea that came first, really I think from the expression of doing things "in tandem" meaning doing two things at once.  The unicycle idea just followed from there - I guess "pure AF" could more properly be referred to as "bicycle mode" in that it is normal cycling.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mel<br><br>I know what you mean about wanting change - that is something I normally experience but have not so much with AF.  It has just worked.  My tweak came about BECAUSE I wanted to keep to the rules more closely (beacuse it worked so well) but my backlogs and crisis items were getting in the way.  I know I could "just do them" within the existing rules but I hated doing that - it somehow felt that I was failing to use AF properly - and my motivation for my tweak was really to find a way to bring those "exception items" into AF.<br><br>With reference to your comments about the middle pages, I actually find that this method deals with those much better.  The first active pages will generally only have about 1 to 4 items outstanding.  Consequently each pass will result in either dismissal, or doing probably only one item.  As a result I move through the first say 10 active pages on each pass in a matter of minutes rather than hours.  That leaves me to spend the majority of my time on either the middle pages or the last pages group and tasks seem to be progressing much faster as a result.<br><br>I am not sure how I will feel though when I clear my active pages down to a small number as I am definitely clearing early pages a lot quicker now.  I suspect that my rate of addition of new tasks will naturally increase as I will feel happier about adding in more backlog tasks.</div>

<div class="content">Christine, I think I understand your stats reports now, where I hadn't before (the groups of 25).  I was hoping for your sake that you were done with entering your backlogs.  <br><br>This is where we differ though in our approach (or personality). :-)<br>"If you have "must do" or "deadlined" tasks within the Last Pages Group, then boredom and resistance can be higher." <br><br>When I see these types of tasks, I am more motivated to get them done - in effect, always trying to beat the deadline.  That's what gives me peace of mind and why I don't have a tickler system and don't put deadlines for projects at work on my calendar.  The deadlines are irrelevant because it will be done before then.   But then I'm weird enough that I prepay all my bills too.  :-)<br></div>

<div class="meta">2009-05-5 14:39</div>
<div class="content">Mike, thanks for understanding. I think so many of the "my way is better" discussions about productivity are really one personality type talking to another. In my speaking and writing, my audience is primarily people like me, so it works. I do think it's a good thing, however, for the people on this forum to ask one another why they are doing what they do. For example, Mark asked me a long time ago why I had a problem with dismissing tasks. That really helped me get full use of AF. You asking me why I add another rule helps me understand that I need change for motivation. What I am trying to do, however, is make changes that have low overhead. Changing software and giving up AF for something else are high overhead, so I feel what I'm doing is functional for me right now.<br><br>Christine, I agree with what you're saying. I do keep things (school curriculum, husbands, productivity approaches) that really work long-term. LOL But little tweaks keep them fresh and interesting for me. AF is very compelling for me because it includes all kinds of tasks. However, I have gotten discouraged about the length of my list and my progress through it -- thus the tweak. It probably matters much less what the tweak is than that I tweak. So happy tweaking to you. It sounds like you are overcoming a lot. Betrayal is one of the most devastating life events for sure. You're obviously a strong person who will be even better for it.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br><br>I think you are absolutely right about the different ways of doing things having an impact, and there does seem to be a correlation to personality typing.  I''ve certainly gained a lot more insight into this area through this forum.  What really helped me with MBTI was the fact that, for the first time, I realised that my "behaviour" was ok - the fact that I struggled with certain aspects of organisation was not because I was totally useless but because my strengths were in other areas.  Actually it was not so much being ok, but realising that it was "normal" for my type.  A big relief to be normal :-)  It also explained my frustration at why people couldn't see things that to me were patently obvious ...... For me the understanding "why" I or someone else behaves in a certain way makes me a much more tolerant person, or so I hope!.<br><br>My batches of 25 pages sort of just happened - my stats spreadsheet goes up to 100 pages in 4 x 25 units as 25 lines fits nicely on a spreadsheet page.  Oh how we are slaves to the PC!  <br><br>Deadlines always create resistance in me - even tasks I enjoy can be resisted, and I end up putting an immense amount of pressure on myself by leaving things too late - something AF is very definitely helping with.  I really wish I could do those tasks as you do - I'm sure you don't necessarily find them any less resistant but you are able to make that push - I still need to find that trigger. I noticed yesterday that I had real reluctance to put my next backlog project on the list, despite the fact that I really genuinely need to get it out of the way, simply BECAUSE it is not actually deadlined.  Ridiculous or what??? <br><br>I have had periods when I have been on top of those areas, but realise that I have usually had help, either my PA or I have been able to subcontract or delegate. Need to think this through some more I think .....</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mel<br><br>You are so right about the benefit of questioning - I have learned so much from this forum by examining why I am doing something a certain way or why I am struggling with a particular aspect.<br><br>Mind you I am intrigued by your "multiple husbands" solution - <<I do keep things (school curriculum, husbands, productivity approaches) that really work long-term>> :-)<br><br>I've never quite been able to work out why I have tendency to almost self sabotage when I get close to completing a project - I find that when I get close to completion of a project, whether enjoyable or high resistance, I somehow have a real resistance to completion and my speed crawls almost to stop position.  It creates a real element of untidiness - unless I absolutely have to, I leave things uncompleted.  If I HAVE to finish something, such as a client assignment, or a deadlined task, then I will find it incredibly hard to put the files away ..... there is obviously something going on there!!!  <br><br>AF eases that considerably as the finalising tasks will now get done at some stage.  I think that there must be some emotional attachment to my "tasks" - some part of me that "needs" lots of things to do.  I can't say I like the thought of that prospect but it does explain why I sense that I will find AF more difficult when I reduce my pages to a minimal level. Curious .... <br><br>And you are right about the devastating impact of betrayal; I hope I am a stronger person for it but it is not always easy to get over.  However what I have found is that it has given me a lot more insight into situations where others have suffered in some way - manipulation can be very subtle - so life experiences are never wasted and good can always come out of them in one way or another.  So, it's onwards and upwards - well most of the time anyway :-)</div>

<div class="content">"Multiple husbands?"  Oh no, has Mel been reading Steve Pavlina's blogging about  polyamory?!?  <br><br>Christine, if it's any comfort, I used to be the same way about deadlines.  Late night term papers in University, and push everything at work to the last minute.  It just took a few years in a Corporate Reporting job to cure me.  Once I got the feeling of how good it was to get things done early, I think I became positively addicted to that feeling.  <br><br>When at work, I still leave the filing etc. to someone else, because once the job is done in my mind, I don't generally like doing that basic stuff.  However, if I look at it as making a nice, perfect package that is well documented, I can push myself to do that.  That comes from years of doing audit files.  :-)<br><br>Have you thought of doing like I did and hiring someone to babysit you at the final stages of a proejct?  (My babysitter is coming again this weekend. :-)  Like the housecleaning before the cleaner comes, you might do the work before they ever come to start work with you.  Because I know she's coming and I want to just give her work that she can do, it means I have to set things up ahead of time or I'll be wasting her time and having to pay her for it.  <br><br>Have you thought of a mastermind group or some type of accountability group?  I used to run one and it worked quite well.  Or maybe you need a partner in your ventures, because you might not let someone else down where you will let yourself down?  I had a coach for a number of months, and while it didn't work out because she let me be too dominating, it did pay for itself.  <br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine,<br><br>WOW, how interesting this group has become ;-)<br><br>On being O.K.:  Yes, yes, yes.  I was never O.K. as a child.  My ADD and dyslexia isolated me and made me feel wrong and broken.  It was hard.<br><br>When I took that class in MBTI, one thing the instructor did, after we filled out the questionnaire, was to break us up into groups for a simulated "project".  Then she broke us up into different groups for a second "project".  The effect was amazing.  She did not tell us what she was doing or why until it was over, but you can guess: the first grouping was all of those of our type ... the second was a balance of types.  All I can say is that I was dumbfounded.<br><br>But that was not really the end of it, nor really the Ah Ha moment.  I immediately read about personality types and a few years later, joined the (now defunct) INTP group.  That was my Ah Ha moment.  I had the intense and direct experience of talking to hundreds of people who were virtually clones.  OY!  ;-)  Now I knew I was not so much broken as of a type which was in the minority in our culture.  And really, as a feature of the type, I could usually not fit in.  Nothing about ME changed so much as that my understanding of that fact made it O.K. to feel outside of the system.  It was great.<br><br>On Deadlines:  I react the same way you do.  I think Jacqueline has typed you as a 7 ... I don't know but it could be the case.  As a 5, under stress, I go to low 7 as well and I can completely relate to your not completing things.  Especially the part about not doing the last .001% of the work that would allow me to call it complete.  No matter how small that last bit, I tend to want to leave it undone.  I'm not sure how that relates to 7 at the moment, I've never thought of it in those terms.  (But you can be assured that I will.  ;-)  For me, I've just thought of it as rebellion.  "You can't control me!  I'll do whatever I want."  Very regressive behavior.<br><br>On Resistance:  You've gotten a lot of unsolicited advice here ;-)  Here is some more ;-) ;-)  One thing that seems to be true of most of us is that we tend to meet expectations.  That is great on the upside but pretty bad on the downside.  That is to say, if you keep talking in terms of your resistance to tasks, you are setting an expectation of yourself to resist.  The old wives (who were they, anyway?) knew this when they cautioned: "Speak of the devil and he will appear."  That is why we have so many other names for evil, for example.  Or put so well and clearly in the Harry Potter material: "He who must not be named."<br><br>I always, and I truly mean ALWAYS, advise clients to restructure their language to use terminology opposite to what they are currently using, as it pertains to the "problem".  Statements such as "I used to resist this kind of thing but now that I understand myself better, I feel drawn to get right to things and not put them off."  Yes, it seems simple minded but language shapes our thought.  (For any complex thoughts, it is not even possible to have them without language.  CF: George Orwell for more on this.  ;-)  It is much like the effect of driving along, seeing something on the side of the road, staring at it a moment too long, and being startled by the car wandering out of the lane in the direction you were looking.<br><br>So basically I'm saying that the first step in managing resistance (or indeed anything) is to remove it from your self-image by banishing it from your self-description.  This is the reason affirmations work so well ... they focus the mind on the solution rather than the problem.   It is not denial, as some claim.  Once you have analyzed the problem, you don't have to keep focusing on it.  You can focus on the opposite and move in that direction.  It is all a matter of thinking what is most useful to think.  Athletes have always known this.  They are not "lying" when they say they are going to break the record today.  They may or may not, but they certainly won't if they don't believe they will.<br><br>With all of the tweaks described on this forum, one thing has been lurking in the back of my mind.  Do the tweaks help, or do they institutionalize the problem?  IOW, sometime the solution to "resistance" is to simply get down to it.  There is no one simple answer for everyone, to be sure.  But it is true that we build muscle by working against resistance.  Likewise, for our will, we build that by doing what is hard when we don't want to do it, rather than by doing it for a treat of candy at the end.<br><br>Of course, whatever works, works, and I would never advise getting into a pitched battle with a tough problem just to build will power.  But, OTOH, I question building systems that weaken one's will power.  IOW, if you have a child, you will offer it a treat of candy to do a hard thing.  It works.  It is time tested ;-)  But if you ALWAYS offer that candy, the child learns that he will always get candy at the end of any hard thing.  Well, life is not like that and so the child becomes unruly and fights doing tasks that have no instant gratification.  It may sound simplistic, but I often find it helps to understand some of our impulses by looking at them as the children inside of us who never grew up.  (Yeah, it DOES sound simplistic ;-) <br></div>

<div class="content">Thanks Mike, Christine, and Jacqueline for giving me a smile to start my day. :-) I told one of my husbands about it. LOL I've actually had just one for 17 years. Gosh I feel old!<br><br>Christine, I was experiencing betrayal so many times (not with men so much as with girlfriends) that I finally learned what the problem was. I'm not suggesting this is you're issue. It obviously isn't! I always thought I was flawed in some way as to attract these really crazy, cruel people. Now I know that I was brought up to always assume that if people were mistreating me, it was my fault. After doing some very painful housecleaning where relationships are concerned, I now know so much more freedom and peace. It isn't that I'll never experience betrayal again, but I do think the frequency will at least go down! I'm blessed not to have married a crazymaker at least. :-) I've turned what I've learned into a popular seminar I'm doing called, "How to Quiet Your Crazy-Makers." All of that to say that even our worst circumstances can be used for good. <br><br>Jacqueline and Mike, I can't relate to the whole not finishing a task thing. I have a huge desire for completion. The only thing that does mess me up is if I'm not able to complete a task I want to complete. Then I will sometimes leave it undone. For me, getting started is the hard part. That's why AF works so well for me (I can work as long as I want to).<br><br>Mike, you are right on the money with the thinking issue. This is so huge and it gets very little press. I love your fitness example because I'm big into weightlifting. If you can change your thoughts, it's really at least half the battle. For example, if I convince myself that weightlifting is fun and very rewarding (I believe that!), it's no real effort to get to the gym. But if I let the, "It takes too long" or "It exhausts me" thoughts creep in, I'm in trouble. As far as forcing oneself to deal with resistance, I think there's a time and place for that. But it's doomed as a long-term strategy imo. In essence, I think forcing oneself is really fighting the negative thoughts rather than changing them. IOW, "I know this workout is going to take so long and really wipe me out, but I MUST do it. I WILL do it." This is less effective than retraining the mind to think, "Working out is fun. The time flies. I'll only do what I feel like doing." Lately I am also trying to think of my dh's jujitsu philosophy. He defeats opponents by using their own force. So I try to think, "How can I use the negative habits or forces that are already in place to achieve what I want?" I do this with myself and others. <br><br>This is such a fascinating conversation. Thanks! Have any of you read any good books on motivation? This is an area I'm interested in for future writing and speaking.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Good Morning Mel,<br><br>The problem with finding ways to improve motivation is that there are many reasons people lack motivation.  And that is one reason we have so many time management systems, people have so many different problems getting things done that it takes different systems to answer the needs.  Well, that and also that most systems answer the same need and those who have different problems are somewhat left out in the cold.<br><br>Procrastination is one of the things most often talked about in the context of motivation.  But procrastination is only a symptom of the loss of motivation ... it is simply putting things off because we are not motivated to do them.  The loss of motivation itself is most often attributed to a feeling of being overwhelmed by the task at hand and the solutions given by various writers mostly address that as if it were the universal reason.  But it is actually only one reason ... if perhaps the most common.  Other reasons are fear of failure, fear of success ... and quite a long list of others.<br><br>One way to address motivation is to understand why it is occurring in your particular case.  That approach is often ignored in favor of simply regurgitating solutions to the feeling of overwhelm which are so frequently presented (chunking down to a more manageable task, for example).  If you wished to delve into the many other causes of motivation loss there are some excellent books which would help there.  (I'll go look in my library when the sun rises ;-)   It strikes me that one of the better ones is by Arron T. Beck, but I might be misremembering that one.  I'll check.<br><br>NLP takes a more direct approach.  It examines what people who are successful in doing things actually do.  IOW, it does not spend a lot of time looking at the problem but more in looking at how the thing is done successfully.  Kind of a logical approach, it seems to me.  Along that line the standard submodality work is helpful.  Hypnosis and affirmations are also helpful ... it seems as if many people have used them successfully.  While it may seem to be a confrontational approach, I don't think it is (and I'll address that point later.<br><br>I think the most general description of how NLP attacks this kind of problem is that it decomposes the mechanism of both the successful approach as well as the problem, looks for what is different, and then changes only what is different ... IOW, what is controlling.  Beside the typical submodality work, there is another approach which is very interesting, if you want to get into it.  I say "get into it" because it is more technical and requires more work.<br><br>The method is described in this book: <br><br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Emotional-Hostage-Rescuing-Your-Life/dp/0932573037/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1241689091&sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Emotional-Hostage-Rescuing-Your-Life/dp/0932573037/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1241689091&sr=8-1</a><br><br>There is more discussion of the method in:<br><br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Emprint-Method-Guide-Reproducing-Competence/dp/0932573029/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_c" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Emprint-Method-Guide-Reproducing-Competence/dp/0932573029/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_c</a><br><br>and<br><br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Know-How-Programs-Inventing-Patterning/dp/0932573002/ref=pd_bxgy_b_text_c" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Know-How-Programs-Inventing-Patterning/dp/0932573002/ref=pd_bxgy_b_text_c</a><br><br>All paperback books.  (I've been lucky buying from Amazon's resellers.  In most cases, the cost of the book even with the shipping is as little as half what Amazon is selling it for.)<br><br>The basic idea is that emotions are not primary.  This is also the premise of submodality work but this book takes a slightly different cut at it.  Rather than change perception, it advises changing the "components" of emotion.  By "components" the authors refer to what they see as the basic elements making up all emotions, in various mixes and strengths.  These are:<br><br>- Time Frame<br>- Modality<br>- Involvement<br>- Intensity<br>- Comparison<br>- Tempo<br>- Criteria, and<br>- Chunk Size<br><br>Modality, for example, is the feeling you have about a task.  In order to feel motivated to do a task you need to feel that:<br><br>- "It needs to be done." (It is necessary)<br>- "It is mine to do."  (I'm responsible for it.)<br>- "I can do it." (It is possible for ME to do it.)<br><br>Each of those statements is must be there.  If one is missing, you'll be demotivated.  For a personal example:  I've been procrastinating fixing a problem with the battery on one of our cars.  (IOW, I've been demotivated.)  I realize that I can do it.  No problem -- I've done it before; I've already taken the battery out so I know how to put it back; I've decided it needs replacement and have purchased a new one.  I am clearly not overwhelmed by the task so no solution which deals with solving overwhelm can possibly help me.  I know I am responsible for it.  But what is missing is the feeling that it is necessary.  I can easily get a ride from the neighbor.  My wife has her transportation.  I don't have that many errands to run.  Etc.  If something came up that made it absolutely necessary to have that car running today, it would be clicking over in under an hour.  But until that point, I'll probably just keep seeing it on my list.  And, you can see that the standard "chunk it down" approach won't work.  The tools are out, the battery is there ... even the hood (bonnet? ;-) on the car is unlatched.  The only remaining thing is to PUT IT IN!  I can't see how much affirmations would help ... I don't have any particular emotion attached to a car battery ;-)  Even submodality manipulation would not work as there is no real emotional impediment to putting it in.  I simply don't have the feeling that it is necessary to do at this moment.  To get the batter in, short of needing to drive to the hospital in an emergency ;-) all I really need do is convince myself ... give myself reasons ... that it is really necessary to do it.<br><br>Likewise, tempo is crucial to how you feel about something.  The difference between feeling anxious and calm is largely a difference in your tempo.  It may seem odd, but the difference between almost opposite emotions comes down to a difference it one or two of those components.  If you think about it, fear and excitement are basically the same thing!  In both of those you are in a fast tempo and personally very involved.  One thing but not the only thing) that differs is time frame.  Fear is more in the present (if you push it into the future it becomes more worry than fear) and excitement more in the future. ... IOW, change the tempo, modality, time fame (and some other elements) and you will change your emotion.  <br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Mike. I buy a lot of Amazon books from the marketplace, too. I will check these out. You make some excellent points. It would be disastrous if I were equally motivated to do everything at once! Not all procrastination is problematic; in fact, it may be very functional. I personally love looking through papers or even my AF list and getting rid of things I do not have to do because the time is past. This is very functional for me. Doing it all would make me nuts! It isn't even possible. That's why I love AF so much. It allows me to acknowledge this fact without guilt and to choose what to do at any given time. In the past when presented with discretionary time, I had no idea what to do because I kept trying to determine what was "most important." Mark makes such an important point on this. Importance is a constantly changing reality. Cleaning out my fridge right now isn't important today. If the power goes out and the food rots, it will become critical. LOL<br><br>I agree with you about the very limited take on motivation that most authors take. I'll add reading in this area to my list and we'll see if I'm motivated to do it!</div>

<div class="meta">2009-05-8 3:10</div>
<div class="content">Yeah, but Gordon, I think you'd "do it now" if you weren't unmotivated or procrastinating.  Mike's talking about the person who *knows* that it needs to be done, but isn't motivated far enough to do it.  Like right now, I know my dishes need to be put in the dishwasher, but I'm kind of waffling that it's really my responsibility to do (is it my turn? why is it always my turn?).<br><br>Or I *know* I "need" to start laying hardwood floor, it's my responsibility to get it done (in one way or another), but because I've never done it before, I'm afraid that I can't do it.  So I'm not motivated to do it - at least until I've gathered enough knowledge to feel confident that I won't botch the job.<br><br>At least I think that's what we're talking about, not having read the book... :-)</div>

<div class="content">Phew - after a not so easy week I returned to post a response as intended the other day to find lots more stuff to read!  This may be a long post (will I ever beat Mike tho') so those of a nervous disposition can look away now :-)<br><br>Jacqueline - <br>I've found with AF that I getting that feeling of completing something before a deadline and it IS a good feeling - it is one I want to get used to but it still feels a bit alien at present!  Your ideas are great but until I can get my business up and running again (which is difficult with current time pressures) I don't have an income so have to put those options on hold for now.  However I now have a friend who is coming over for a couple of hours each week to help and that is really showing results.  It works great from the accountability aspect too, as well as providing a fresh pair of eyes to see where the issues really are.<br><br>Mike -<br>I think it highlights how schooling and general work and training methods tend to cater to what is perceived as "the norm" leaving those who struggle to stay motivated or keep focused to either endure an uphill battle or feel inferior in some undefined way that they are never able to put a finger on.<br><br>The not finishing things is an interesting issue in that it defies common sense.  Even though I see myself doing it I can't quite identify what the root of the issue is - the closest I can get is that it is like when you are reading a really good book, and as you get to the end you have mixed emotions - you want to get to the end to find out what happens but at the same time you know you will have finished the book and therefore the enjoyment of it will end.<br><br>I do agree with you regarding negative language - that does have a real influence - having a Positive Mental Attitude is more than just a catch phrase but at the same time is not an answer in itself.  When I first did a coaching course I struggled with the concept of phrasing goals as if they were already true as it seemed I was "lying".  I had to grasp that it was the visualisation of the achievement that influenced my actions towards that achievement.  However I also think that our feelings about ourselves are about more than just saying the right things but in genuinely learning to accept ourselves which is more difficult and requires us to be honest with ourselves (from a positive as well as a negative perspective).<br><br>And as for tweaks - using AF as an example I feel very strongly that it is vital to learn AF as is before trying to change it and that ties in with what you are saying.  I strongly believe that if you want to change something you have to thoroughly understand what it is and how it works before playing around with it.  That holds true for systems, and also for ourselves to a degree.  It's maybe not the best analogy as there may often be stages in that understanding that can be treated in isolation.  eg with AF deciding on notebook type, or with changing personal behaviour you may want to deal with something like giving up an addiction whilst still looking at reasoning for addictive behaviour patterns. The danger of tweaks is that looking for them too early can mean that they become avoidance techniques rather than tools in your toolkit.  I love the child analogy - that is a great picture.  Some things may have a place at an early stage in a child's development but many need to be grown out of in order to progress - like stabiliser wheels when learning to ride a bike.<br><br>Mel -<br>I can relate to that feeling of believing that when people mistreat you it must be your fault and in many ways betrayal by friends is the worst because you believe they know you.  Think I'm still in the housecleaning stage on some of those things tho' :-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine,<br><br>Yeah, you turn away for a moment and the whole place goes to hell ;-)<br><br>As with most things, human action has many components.  You can have all the positive attitude in the world but if you are not nearly seven feet tall, you can pretty well forget playing for the NBA.  OTOH, if you are eight feet tall and have a negative attitude, you will probably fail.<br><br>It gets tricky when we talk about "accepting ourselves".  What  is it that we are wanting to accept?  What part of ourselves?  That notion implies that we are something immutable ... yet are we not in the process of growing and changing?  Do we want to accept that we are what we are at this moment and then stop growing?  As for myself, I don't accept limitations that I believe I can change.  I have decided that I am not going to play for the NBA so I scarcely think of that as a limitation ... though I suppose technically it is.  I don't see it as a limitation because I have no desire to play basketball.  (I also probably have no desire to do it because I know I can't.)<br><br>OTOH,  when I was in school and did not know calculus, I did not accept that as some kind of limitation.  I knew that if I believed that I could learn calculus that I would.  So I'm not sure of the efficacy of accepting ourselves for who we are.  I am often asked if some technique or other will help a person change something about themselves.  My answer is always "Yes"!  How can that be?  How do I know?  I don't even know the person so how can I say that anything in particular would have some particular result?<br><br>Well, firstly the person asked, which implies that they don't know.  If they don't know then they are at least open to the possibility that they will get the result they want.  At that point the effect of any feedback I give will be to either support the person's intention or undermine it.  There is no "correct" answer ... only an answer that helps or one that hinders.  If I had my way, doctors who had a reasonable treatment for whatever ailed you would not tell you all the reasons it might not work ... they would simply tell you that they could fix you right up -- and then do their best.<br><br>One last thought ... unless you really believe that some people are genetically programed to be successful and  others to be failures, you have to believe that change and growth is possible.  No infant is born a CEO or Olympic athlete.  They get to those places by actions which are supported by beliefs and desires which are supported by the results of actions.  The basic difference is that they look outward toward a goal, while others look inward.</div>

<div class="content">Mike & Peter<br><br>Despite knowing virtually nothing about basketball (and it's OK Mike, I can accept that!!) your posts definitely had me ROTFL.  I do like this forum ....:-)<br><br>Mike, as to your comments regarding acceptance, I wouldn't see it as a specifically measurable position - I think we all have a perception of ourselves which is not fixed but can vary according to mood, which in turn can vary according to circumstances.  It almost comes down the rational vs intuition debate.  We may know rationally that we can, or have achieved xyz, but still feel a failure.  The two may bear little relationship. To the outside world someone may appear one thing but feel another.  However that person will no doubt have "good days" and "bad days" and if they were able to mark their position on an achievement chart (for want of a better definition) would inevitably believe themselves to be in different positions at different times.<br><br>I totally believe that growth and change is possible but believe the key has a lot to do with identifying the right path.  If you are on the right path then you will find fulfillment in what you are doing, whether that be playing for the MBA, running a business, working in an office, bringing up a family, teaching, nursing etc etc etc.  Put an MBA star in the "wrong" environment for them and the stress will destroy them - put someone else in the position of playing for the MBA and the stress will destroy them.  To me it's about finding what is right for the individual and helping them to progress on that path.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jupiter<br><br>I think you have misunderstood but I'm happy to explain further - please feel free to ask if anything is still not clear.<br><br>Because I was cycling through the pages slowly, by the time I got to the end of my list I had several new pages of totally unactioned tasks.  I treated these pages as a group - the "Last Pages Group."  As it would take a long time to work on those pages I started the normal AF cycle from the beginning of my pages "at the same time".  That is my "Tandem Mode" and I allow myself to switch between the "normal" AF page and the "Last Group" whenever I feel like it.<br><br>This works when the last pages grow quickly between cycles, such as when I have added a lot of backlog items or "do it now" type items to my list.  Those items have been added naturally - not by collecting tasks from earlier pages.  It may be that items are duplicated by accident but if so then they are crossed off if already actioned. <br><br>Hope that helps .....</div>
