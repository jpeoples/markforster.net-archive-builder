<div class="content">I've been trying to use the "Stop Doing List" activity (as describe <a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2007/4/14/action-versus-activity.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2007/4/14/action-versus-activity.html</a> ). But I've been finding it difficult to keep up with it.<br><br>Perhaps I'm not as clear as I need to be on "what's bringing the business forward"? As in, I'm not clear on exactly what I /should/ be doing?<br><br>Has anyone else tried this exercise? What were your experiences with it? What other techniques have you used to reduce the busy work that you do?</div>

<div class="content">I think the 'live part' of Ryan's link above is not working (I get a 'Page Not Found'), so here it is again:<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2007/4/14/action-versus-activity.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2007/4/14/action-versus-activity.html</a></div>

<div class="content">BKK:<br><br>Thanks. I've corrected the link on Ryan's post so it now works. <br><br>All:<br><br>Links will not work if they are immediately followed by a punctuation mark, (for example <a href="http://www.markforster.net)." target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net).</a><br><br>If you want a link to be followed by a punctuation mark, it's necessary to put a space after the link (for example <a href="http://www.markforster.net" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net</a> ).</div>

<div class="content">If you add an 's' onto the word "List", and come up with "Stop Doing Lists", it would be a good first step for a lot of people if they have this problem.  Before I got into this thing, I had way too many lists, including lists of lists.  It is an easy way to over-organise and spin your wheels.</div>

<div class="content">thanks for the link. i did not read it before ! it gave me an idea ie puting on omnifocus context a new one call stop doing list were i will put items i want to get rid asap for staying concentrate on my aims. anyway there are some great ideas the one i love the luch is the idea to stay concentrate on your core business. i made this mistake before and it cost me my previous job. but thanks to God it was for something much better I would ever imagined.</div>

<div class="content">I haven't tried that "Stop Doing" list. My first thoughts (as a serial procrastinator) is that doing some of those activity/busywork do at least gets me off my butts and might lead to action/realwork. Problem arises when activity/busywork are only things I get to do all day. <br><br>Now that "Stop Doing" list sounds useful to me. It's not to remove all the "fun stuff" from my Superfocus list but to remove the "totally useless fun stuff" leaving "somewhat useful fun stuff" as the lubricant in my Superfocus list.</div>
