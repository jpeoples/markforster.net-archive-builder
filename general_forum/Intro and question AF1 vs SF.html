<div class="content">Hello everyone!<br><br>A GTDer for two years, I paid attention to Mark's approach a few days ago and the idea of AF captivated me.<br><br>I wonder however whether to use AF1 or SF. As far as I can see, there are two additions in SF to AF1: 1. entering in C2 urgent tasks (same page) and 2. entering in C2 unfinished started tasks (next page).<br><br>As for entering urgent tasks I don't really see the need for it, whatever is urgent gets done now (AF1 rules). Looking at the demo of SF by Sarah I found the entering of “tea in the microwave” a little funny - unless it is there solely for the purpose of describing the sequence of actions, but wasn’t really entered in the list. Well, may be there is some satisfaction in striking through another line, but I can dispense with it.<br><br>The second addition, entering unfinished started tasks in C2 (next page), forces you to go on working often on whatever you start, to ensure you finish what you started. I can see its value, but also at least one ﻿drawback: I might be willing to start working on a task which I don’t especially like - but must be done - on the condition that I meet it again far down the line. If I know I will meet this task page after page, I might not be willing to start with it at all! I am not talking here about tasks with a due date, that’s a different story.<br><br>Yeah, one can surely play with C1 and C2 and decide that task x, say, washing the dishes a la Mark, goes in C2 because he feels the sink is not a good place for the dishes to stay. Or plainly cheat and re-enter an unfinished task in C1 down the line, cause I don’t want to see it again too soon. But here one starts playing predominantly from the conscious or rational mind and the magic of AF1 - invoking the intuitive mind to be part of the process - loses weight.<br><br>So right now I tend to prefer AF1, but I assume I must be missing something (may be quite a lot...) and would like to hear from experienced users what are the pros and cons of each system.<br><br>Thank you!</div>

<div class="content">I think it depends on how you work and your personality, honestly.  In my work, there are very few things that are "urgent" in the "this has to be done in the next hour" sense. But I am the self-appointed Queen of Little and Often, so my C2 gets used almost exclusively for those continuing tasks.  As for starting something that you have built up a lot of resistance to and don't want to have lingering in C2 making you crazy... I solve this by writing the tasks as very discrete, small steps.  You can see this in the demo (screens 12-14) when I flip to a project list in Evernote.  I KNOW what needs to come next in that project (making some silk banners), and I could just go up to the sewing room and work on it for hours at a time, but it's a project towards which I harbor a great deal of resentment and I don't want to have to deal with it for long stretches of time.  That's why the task on the list was "cut out backgrounds" and the next step - pressing them - was treated as a new task and put at the end of C1.<br><br>(And the "tea in microwave" really was an "urgent" task - I had already forgotten that it was there once and had to reheat it; I didn't want to forget it again!)</div>

<div class="content">Use SuperFocus, but:<br>1) Never consider any tasks urgent, and always enter them last page<br>2) Always interpret your tasks as "do as much as I feel like then put them away for later".<br><br>If you abide by this, you are in fact doing AF1!  Which is fine because AF1 is a good system.  :-)<br><br>But if some truly urgent things come along, you have a place to put them.  And if there's ever a project you want to focus on and off for a day, you have a place to put that too.</div>

<div class="content">Thank you Sarah! I can see now how to deal with a resisted task so that it remains in C1. And I understand C2 can be useful to remind you of things you tend to forget.<br><br>Yet another question arises concerning C2: what if I start a task and then I understand that it is not worthy pursuing it anymore? Mmm... I guess at that point the task is finished. But this will need a forceful decision to be taken  - otherwise I cannot move forward to the following page - while in AF1 the task may remain in the list for a while until the system takes care of the pruning. Less friction. Less heat. Cool :)</div>

<div class="content">What you propose Alan  is to use C2 as a parking place for tasks I want/need to have in focus right now. Oh yes, this I can really use. Thanks!</div>

<div class="content">Yes.  What I propose is SF, take out the SF features, then put them back in.  When viewed this way, SF is simply a very desirable extension of AF1.  <br><br>(The other way to view SF is to focus on the second column, which has benefits and disadvantages.  But a minimalist use of the second column has no disadvantage.)</div>
