<div class="content">What is a routine in the sense of Mark's latest book "50 secrets"? What do we mean, when we talk about establishing routines?<br><br>In another thread @nuntym writes:<br><br>"I have established routines and systems now of tasks that I habitually do based on the circumstances at hand and times of the day."<br><br>What is a routine? Is it doing something at the same tima of the day? Is it soemthing you always do after something else you always do, meaning, doing one thing after another in a optimized sequence?</div>

<div class="content"><< Is it soemthing you always do after something else you always do, meaning, doing one thing after another in a optimized sequence? >> <br><br>I've always interpreted it in that sense.  I find these kinds of routines emerge naturally with many of Mark's methods, especially the No-List methods.</div>

<div class="content">Christopher:<br><br>Seraphim has described it pretty well.<br><br>A routine can be very simple:<br><br>"When leaving the house, I always check that I have the house keys, the car keys and my wallet"<br><br>It may be simple, but adhering to it means that you don't have to go back into the house to get your car keys, don't find that you've got no money to pay the car park charge just after you've put the car in the car park, and don't get back to the house to find you've locked yourself out. (All of which have happened to me in the past!)<br><br>Or the routines I was taught when learning to drive a car, e.g. mirror, signal, brake, turn.<br><br>Or they can be much more complicated, like the checklist a pilot goes through before a flight.<br><br>Routines vary from the trivial to literal life-savers (as in two of the above examples).</div>

<div class="content">Thank you both for the replies!<br><br>One minor thing I might add, after reading your replies and thinking a bit about them. The actions a given routine consists of are always taken in the abstract. "Checking for you key" is always describing a class of actions, not the specifics of a certain instance of having checked for the keys.<br><br>Mark, yes, the forgotten keys are certainly a part of growing up. After having had that experience with my first rented flat, I maintained that the true test of "adultness" is when you stopped forgetting your keys.</div>
