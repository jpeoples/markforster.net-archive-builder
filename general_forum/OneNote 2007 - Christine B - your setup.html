<div class="content">Hi Christine B,<br><br>I am very intrigued about how you have set up OneNote 2007 for AF.  I am currently using Outlook 2007, but use OneNote for project lists.  Would you please describe your setup in OneNote 2007 in a detailed manner?<br><br>Thanks!<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Hi David<br><br>I posted some info in a post a while back which gives some detail as to my specific layout, but is now many many pages back in the forum :-) so you may like to check out this link<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/622246" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/622246</a><br><br>My OneNote system is starting to evolve as I go along so here goes:<br>(there will be some overlap with previous post so apologies.....)<br><br>David, the main section is that of Pages and for me that is the heart of "my" digital system.  I am still writing my lists by hand and adding my OneNote solution to it.  For me at present that is the "best" method but that may change if I feel I can go totally digital.  At this point, despite being a highly digital person :-), I am finding paper lists very practical for AF and intuitive for me.  The Projects and Information sections are, for me, natural steps both from an AF and a OneNote perspective, but it is the Pages part that facilitate the AF system for me. <br><br> For information, I used OneNote extensively under DIT as well with a separate section group for Projects (Current Initiatives)  I am still extensively referencing that Notebook (called Do it Tomorrow) for my projects and other info but believe I will ultimately incorporate it within my notebook called Autofocus<br><br>NB For anyone unfamiliar with OneNote it works on the look and feel of a Filofax style organiser, with individual notebooks.  I have capitalised Notebook above to avoid confusion with "an A4 or similar notebook a la AF" :-)  <br><br>Section 1 is just called Beta Testing. It contains 2 pages, the first being Mark's email with the instructions, the second being notes that I am making about my initial thoughts in testing the system. Those questions are becoming largely irrelevant now as the Discussion Forum itself is enabling me to question and review my thoughts/feelings/experiences with AF. <br><br>Section 2 is called Pages. Each new "page" of items is written on a separate page. Pages are called Page 1 - Active, Page 2 - Active etc. As a Page becomes non-active the wording will be changed to just Page 1 etc., so all active pages will immediately be identifiable.  As my pages are 34 lines, that easily fits onto one screen page so every item can be clearly seen. As I complete an item I highlight it in yellow using the standard highlight tool. That makes it easy to scan the page for remaining items. When I get to the point of items being rejected, I will highlight it in green.<br><br>My standard font in OneNote is Calibri 11 point.  I set the pages (under Format/Rule Lines) to Narrow Ruled, which lines up perfectly.<br><br>I am only entering a page of items into OneNote once I have created a full page of tasks in my A4 paper notepad.  It takes probably 2 minutes to enter, and check that I have entered 34 lines, and by the time I have filled a page there will normally be several items already crossed off so they are highlighted in yellow as above.<br><br>I can instantly see outstanding and completed items.  Rejected items will be highlighted in green. I intend to set up a separate list for all rejected items to enable future monitoring, and expect to set this up a separate section as opposed to just adding it to my list section. <br><br> Section 3 I have at present just called Lists. At the moment this just contains one page [Shopping List] but I may (not sure yet) use this section to record items awaiting response if (and only if) they do not work for me by retaining in the pages as Mark suggests.<br><br>This section has not at this point changed from my initial post.  <br><br>Section 4 is called schedules. It contains two pages, namely calendars for January & February 2009, on which I am adding scheduled items and appointments. It suits me to have my schedules in OneNote rather than Outlook but others will no doubt want to use scheduling methods which they are used to.  For me the advantage of OneNote with AF is that it enables my schedule to be kept in the same place as my "pages".  One task on my list is to "check schedule" which will be automatically relisted on a daily basis or as necessary.<br><br>Section 5 is called Projects.  In this section I am setting up Pages or Page Groups for the projects which I have put into AF.  At this stage I am not automatically bringing my DIT projects in, but using this purely for thoughts and progressions coming out of AF.  This will change in the future (I have a task to review my DIT projects and migrate them as and when appropriate - i.e. when that task stands out!) I have posted elsewhere how I am finding that I am re-evaluating the way I use some of my "normal" project To Do type lists.  For example, one of the "projects" I happily worked on over the weekend was my Family Tree.  I have a list of tasks and treated that list as an AF list, choosing by feel which items to do and highlighting actioned tasks accordingly.  The individual items on any project may or may not find their way onto my AF pages.  I am finding that that depends primarily on whether I am now naturally actioning that project by small tasks (e.g. Tax Return) or by time blocks (e.g. Family Tree).<br><br>I expect this section to be replaced by a section group at some point in the future.<br><br>Section 6 is called Information.  At this stage this is being used as a repository for information specifically generated through using AF to date.  Several posts reference outside resources, for example there were links to some excellent sites regarding messy handwriting.  In the case of any such links where I want to retain that information, I just "Send To OneNote" and so have that information including all relevant links to hand.  NB I already have a Notebook called Information so that info may move there later, but I also have a task to regularly review my systems and/or filing structure/s which will address that as and when necessary.<br><br>Finally I just have a section called Odd Stuff!   I use the screen clip utility to keep track of where I last read up to in the Discussion Forum and that page is in that section.  If I am doing a detailed post to the forum, such as this one I am now using a blank OneNote page (as being easier to read and correct than the forum.  That page (this page!) is in that section.  I am using this section to keep any Unfiled Notes specifically generated whilst using AF, rather than leave them in OneNote's Unfiled Notes book.  This is part of my personal review system to see what AF is throwing up for me, and will be rationalised as part of my "reviewing my systems" task.<br><br>One of the significant discoveries for me of using AF is that it is prompting me to look at my current systems and procedures in a different way.  I have no doubt that my OneNote set up may well change but this is where it is at at present.  <br><br>David, an exceptionally long post I am afraid but there probably won't be that many people reading it.  Hopes that helps you ...... <br></div>

<div class="content">Thanks David.  Thinking of creating a template at some point - when it has evolved a bit more perhaps .....</div>

<div class="content">Yes, nice post.  And something I may get into as I have my project planning in OneNote.<br><br>I can see an interesting way to manage "dismissed items" ... if you tag them you can view items by tag and they will be all together in a page.  I suppose you might also work something like that with the partially completed items.  Something to experiment with.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for that Mike.  The ability to tag items is very useful and of course everyone will ultimately tailor their electronic solutions to their own requirements.  On my paper lists I have entered "batches" of backlog items (usualy only around 10 items at a time to avoid overload) and just bracketed them on paper.  I will probably use tags just to identify those items on a screen scan (mainly because they will enable me locate the relevent papers - in that one batch = one pile of papers), but their use is infinitely flexible.<br><br>Also items can be automatically sent to Outlook for those who prefer the Outlook approach for monitoring.</div>
