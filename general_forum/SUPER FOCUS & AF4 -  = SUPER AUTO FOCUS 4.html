<div class="content">Hello, <br><br>I am very found of AF4 even if I added some others techniks coming from GTD and DIT.<br><br>I tried super focus this week on a 100 tasks and find it great because of the grouping of my urgent tasks. <br><br>This morning I woke up on this icy day and my first think was for Mark Forster. <br><br>Why couldn't we make a new system which could be a mixt of the 2 system I mean<br><br>1. A long list separated in close list and open list horizontaly (=AF4)<br>2. A vertical right column for urgent things. (=SF)<br><br>The result could take the advantage of AF4 and the advantage of superfocus. <br><br>By the way we may add in front of each tasks 3 letters<br>R = recurring - U - unfisnished and maybe for me C - call for i like treating all my calls together in one batch when i feel ready too. <br><br>Mark and all of you  what do you think about it ?</div>

<div class="content">I understand you to suggest multiple pages, and on each page have 3 columns: open, closed, and urgent. Following SuperFocus that would mean any tasks from the first 2 columns you want to keep working go there. And any other urgent tasks would go there. <br><br>Is this right?</div>

<div class="content">Sorry I was not clear enought so I explain again. Forget about close or open list.<br>---<br>Imagine you are on a AF4 list. A usual one. <br>At the end of your list you have a line <br>Here begins your new tasks and before you have your old one.<br><br>Now imagine your part the all page with a vertical line, just in the middle of the page.<br><br>So on your left colomns are your tasks old and new (after the horizonal line) and on the right a colum where you could put nothing but your urgent tasks. <br><br>With this method you could focus on the right column to see your urgent task. <br>On upper right part you have your old urgent tasks undone, on the bottom after the line you have all your new  urgent tasks.<br><br>Well I gona mak a draw of it  ;-)<br><br>+ = divider vertical and horizontal. <br><br><br>AF4 LEFT COLUM PAGE                 + AF 4  RIGHT COLUM PAGE <br>old task                                              +       old urgent task<br>old task                                              +       old urgent task<br>old task                                              +       old urgent task<br>old task                                              + <br>old task                                              +<br>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br>New task                                           +        New urgent task<br>New task                                           +        New Urgent task<br>New  task                                          +<br><br><br><br>How to work with it <br>Like on AF4 except that you can drop on the right colum at any time to do the urgent tasks<br><br>You can the follow all what is undone, all what is left to do, all what is old, and all what is new <br><br>The only exception could be for the recurring tasks you have a special page where to put them and each day you just do them writing on your AF4 list work on current initiative. <br><br>For me the system doesnt replace a special work on each project like on GTD but let you do things little by little.</div>

<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>Jupiter,<br><br>I think I understood how your system works, however I am a bit confused on why there is a 2nd column to put your urgent tasks when there is the open list, how do you decide on whether to place your tasks at the open list or in the 2nd column, and how does that affect the dismissal rules of AF4<br><br>But anyways, how's it? Did it work for you?<br><br>God bless!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Nuntym<br>Well I haven't tried it yet. For the moment I am testing AF4 revision to see how it works. <br>I realize that they are many MF system now. And we invented ours too. So it's interesting to take time to test them little by little and keep the one which suits at the moment. If I have time I shall test it and come back.</div>
