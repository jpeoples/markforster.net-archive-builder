<div class="content">Is anyone else here a total sucker for stationery?  I've just spent an hour in Asda examining the various notebooks, pads, pens, page markers and so on.  They've got a bit of a 'back to school' promo going on.  I had no idea I was there for that long until I checked the time!  I just drift off into a daydream where I imagine how I might use everything and almost rehearse various scenarios in my head.  I must look like a lunatic or a shoplifter to anyone else watching as I stand in a trance for five minutes with a highlighter in each hand mentally weighing up the differences between them.<br><br>They have an A5 exec notebook which is quite nice, good weighty pages with a faint grid ruled on each page and a small concertina pocket at the back, held closed with an elastic loop.  However it's only 80 pages and almost an inch thick so a little overkill.  I picked up some coloured paperclips to try those intead of page markers.  Oh, and a packet of MF-approved Bic Cristals.<br><br>That's me sorted for another week.</div>

<div class="content">Don't get me started :)<br><br>I'm going to start a new thread with a description of the notebook, and system, I'm using.</div>

<div class="content">I'm a stationery freak as well. I spent a long time in TK Maxx today (supposed to be getting Christmas presents) - I felt like I was haunting the stationery! It does make recording tasks so much more fun!</div>

<div class="content">I'm only a partial sucker for stationery :-). Occasionally I get the sense of dissatisfaction with my tools and/or get a new notion of what an ideal tool would be like. I look through the stores searching for a tool matching my imagination. Usually this requires navigating several sections as there are many embodiments of my goal but nothing exactly fitting my original aim. I'll by something, try it, dislike it, and try two other variations, and then I'm set for a few months. I've got a drawer full of barely used stationery products, but sometimes I'll find a use for something in there so it's good to have around.</div>
