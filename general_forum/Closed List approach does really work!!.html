<div class="content">I would just like to say I really like the Closed List approach, to me it is almost like the missing-link with regards to Time Management. I have tried various systems in the past and they all seem to fall short. I have been running with it now for a little under a month and I have really seen my productivity soar.<br><br>The main difference with your system is I actually feel motivated to clear my list each and every day.  If I get close to the end of the day and there are a few items left, I really want to get them done so I can have a completely clear list. Its almost like I am not going to let those few tasks spoil the rest of my achievement for that day. So its and all out approach to get the list clear. <br><br>I have had a couple of days so far where things did not go to plan, but I managed to get back on track quickly. Not only that but I find I now have time to work on my Backlog. Its about the first time in years I am actually feeling on top of my workload. But more importantly I actually feel a sense of real satisfaction at the end of the day, knowing I have cleared a full days work and also knowing I have things under control.<br><br>Great system, many thanks<br><br>Regards<br><br>Steve</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for sharing this, Steve. Yes, one of the great advantages of the DIT system is that you know when you've finished!</div>

<div class="content">I really like the closed list theory and I am sure it can work but I find that I am not disciplined enough,,, too many years of butterflying ( at high speed) from one thing to another and dropping everything to do work or another task to 'please' someone else.<br><br>In my previous role, to get everything done, I just worked longer hours and took work home but the culture in my new employment is to stop on time and not take work home,,, all very well but not satisfying if I haven't completed what I intended or needed to do.<br><br>I know I need to stop but it is hard if your line manager is the one who is keen to drop everything and jitterbug from one thing to another as it has a knock on effect on everyone - the job is in an open plan office with a new set of colleagues- most of the people in the office also jump from one thing to another. When you are dealing with visitors and callers all day, it is inevitable to some extent.<br><br>Perhaps it will get better. At the moment I am being caught out by planning my own work and then being told that something else is due and I wasn't aware it was coming up. That will change as I get more familiar with the new role.<br><br>How can I break out of this mode? I really do want to change and know that such a bad habit will take a while to undo. I am good at multitasking and being able to switch quickly from one topic to another. I need this in my job but I also need to feel better about my workload.<br></div>

<div class="content">Debbie<br><br>You might want to take a look at "The Myth of Multitasking" by Dave Crenshaw as recommended by David Drake in a previous discussion forum posting. I recently bought it as it didn't seem to be available from the libraries in our area (it's listed on Amazon.co.uk) and I think you might find it useful for your situation. I realise that when you answer to others you are somewhat at the mercy of their demands but some of the ideas may still help you. <br><br>As I think Mark has mentioned elsewhere, if answering the phone and responding to your line manager is part of your job then this has to be included in your work and some of the tasks generated may need to be treated as immediate.<br><br>Good luck</div>

<div class="content">I have been totally upto date with my work now for several weeks, and it feels great! I seem to have a lot more time on my hands and much less 'fires to put out'. I believe I have managed this through the consistent application of the Closed List.<br><br>Great idea Mark!!!!</div>

<div class="content">I have a good example of how a Closed List approach works well.<br><br>I have been developing a program to catalogue my CD collection. Rather than continually tinkering with the program, and trying to remember what features I needed to add and problems to fix, I typed a list of EVERYTHING that needed to be done.<br><br>I printed this list, then worked on the items IN A RANDOM ORDER. It didnt matter what sequence I worked the list, because I knew that as soon as everything was crossed off, my big task was COMPLETE.<br><br>Similarly, drawing a line across the page of a closed list saying "that is the boundary for the day" really changes my view of doing work.<br></div>

<div class="content">That's a good example Charles.  i use a similar approach for my project planning and then find that dovetails niceley into AF - I can either work "that list" in a Time Block or add the whole lot into AF.  I am leaning more towards the "add all" approach these days but I think that will be down to personal preference.</div>

<div class="content">Hullo<br><br>I only now stumbled upon the internet site and was completely blown away by how amazing it is!<br><br>Therefore instead of just use the web site i thought i would do my very best to give to the website . Starting with only posting and saying thanks everyone for your hard work. I for one value it.<br><br>I also wish to contribute by uploading some documentary films and different things, i have a question in the assistance discussion section if anyone would like to help me!<br><br>Anyway as I was stating I think I will firstly start by uploading massive amounts of flicks for free online at this internet site. Its a free blogspot as I dont wish to make this forum in trouble for film linking.<br><br>Enjoy the movie on me, I look forward to perhaps add some more.<br><a href="http://watchmoviesonlineforfreehighquality.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://watchmoviesonlineforfreehighquality.blogspot.com/</a></div>
