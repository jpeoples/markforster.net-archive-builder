<div class="content">It occurs to me that SF3 can be extended to have more than two columns.  For example, if you have two jobs, you could put tasks for one job in column 1, and tasks for the other in column 2.  Column 3 would then have the unfinished / urgent items in it.  You then have to advance at least one task in column1 and one task in column 2, as well as clearing column 3, when processing any page.<br><br>I'm dabbling with using column 1 for the next steps taken from top-down, goal-directed, project-managed life planning , and column 2 for ad-hoc stuff that comes in and isn't part of those plans.</div>

<div class="content">I don't really understand what you are doing here. Surely the point of dividing your work into Job 1 and Job 2 is would be to dedicate a specific time period to each of the two jobs?<br><br>However if you have to advance at least one task of Job 1 and at least one task of Job 2 before you can leave a page, it seems that you must be working simultaneously on Job 1 and Job 2. <br><br>So I don't get the point of this.</div>

<div class="content">I agree that if you think your income as an investment banker is disappointing, and you seek to supplement it by driving a taxi at night, your two jobs won't overlap.<br><br>But I run my own business, and chair a voluntary organisation.  I am free to pursue both activities in the office, and at home, and routinely do switch between either kind of task at will.  I wish to strike a balance between the two areas of my life.<br><br>The bit about two jobs in my post was perhaps a distraction.  My interest is in the last paragraph, distinguishing tasks that flow from top down planning from ad-hoc, reactive items.</div>

<div class="content">DavidC:<br><br>I think the system as written is quite capable of striking that balance without your needing to introduce two columns. <br><br>My recommendation would be to use the standard form for several weeks at least before trying to make changes.</div>
