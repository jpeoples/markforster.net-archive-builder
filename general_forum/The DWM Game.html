<div class="content">Still using this excellent system, with filtering on PDA.<br><br>I like the link with intuition/subconscious (do what stands out), but have been considering ways to counter procrastination and self-deception.<br><br>The "Email Game" <a href="http://emailga.me/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://emailga.me/</a> has helped me gain control over email (it requires Gmail), and is congruent with DWM and 43 Folders with its notion of boomeranging messages which essentially moves them around the inbox. The game nature of it seems to help, so I have come up with an idea for DWM.<br><br>Throw a dice and then move forward in the list the corresponding number of lines. If it "stands out" in the spirit of AF/DWM/SF, do something towards the item reached and then move it to one week in the future as usual. Otherwise move it back to where one was before throwing the dice. Throw the dice again and repeat ...<br><br>This would speed up activation of tasks which get put off, yet are important, for they will tend to be brought to Dismissal Cliff faster. I think it preserves the intent of DWM but changes the gearing to add an edge to dismissal tension, and the random nature of the dice works against prevarication.<br><br>I am also considering suffixing each task with the words "for x minutes" or "until I feel like stopping", so that the time element is always borne in mind, and the use of timers is encouraged.<br><br>I haven't tried the dice technique yet, and don't know if the idea can be applied to the AF variants. Has anyone tried a similar technique?<br><br>I am using the original DWM1, so the above may not work in the amended versions which don't use calendar dates.</div>

<div class="content">+JMJ+<br><br>That actually reminds me of a very simple task management technique I heard of years ago.  I do not know what it's called, but I'll call it the Pickle Jar Task Management System.<br><br>1.  Get a large pickle jar (one in which you can put you hand and forearm in) and small scratch pad.<br>2.  Write each task in a separate sheet of the scratch pad, tear it out, fold/roll/crumple it up, and put in the pickle jar.<br>3.  When it is time to pick a task, shake the jar, then reach in and pick one piece of paper inside. If you are ready to do the task, do it.  If not, put it back and pick another one.  If it was unfinished, put it back after doing what you can.  If it was finished, throw it away.  Repeat.<br><br>Simple, ne? ^___^<br><br>And no I haven't tried it, or anything like you have said, yet.<br><br>Heck, you can even make an Autofocus version of that, you need two pickle jars, put your new tasks in one, backlog in the other.  Or something like that ^___^</div>

<div class="content">I'd always be wondering what important and urgent pickles were hiding down there in the jar somewhere...</div>
