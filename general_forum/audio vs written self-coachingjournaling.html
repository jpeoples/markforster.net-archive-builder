<div class="content">As an experiment, I conducted a self-coaching session while walking, and talking into my iphone (headset with mic). For the past week I was writing/typing my responses. I found the exercise laborious, partly because I don't enjoy writing, and partly because I'm having trouble creating two unique voices: present + future self. <br><br>Anyway, the end result (audio) was quite pleasing, and felt more authentic than a written dialogue. <br><br>Anyone experiment with audio vs written journals/self-coaching?</div>

<div class="content">avrum,<br><br>Thanks to you, I discovered Mark's Dreams book free as a pdf (I didn't want to pay $160 for it at amazon.com). I just started reading it today.<br><br>A few years ago I read some studies that showing that writing and speaking are equally effective forms of expression, in terms of their therapeutic value. Thinking is singularly ineffective,.<br><br>So, each morning I would turn on a voice recorder and talk while I drove (alone) to work. I did that for about two years. Eventually I stopped. Now I use the time to listen to books or magazines on my Kindle.<br><br>I do think that the time was well-spent, though. And I still spend time "free-writing" every workday. In my case the research seemed correct, writing and speaking out loud are equally helpful.</div>

<div class="content"><<So, each morning I would turn on a voice recorder and talk while I drove>><br><br>Very interesting. For what purpose? Did/do you listen back to what was recorded? What did you learn?</div>

<div class="content">I think, and there is evidence to back this up (see books by James Pennebaker as well as Mark Forster) that emotional well-being is enhanced by expressing thoughts and feelings. As I mentioned, I still write my thoughts and feelings daily. I usually do not save what I write. <br><br>Likewise I would record my out-loud talking. But I would erase it completely almost all the time.<br><br>You can call it journaling, or self-coaching, or being your own therapist. <br><br>There's a lot of evidence that sitting with someone regularly and talking about your thoughts and feelings improves mood. That person can be a coach, therapist, religious leader, or a sham therapist who has been trained to nod meaningfully and occasionally ask, "And how did that make you feel?"<br><br>There is also evidence that this benefit can be had by speaking or writing your thoughts or feelings without there being another person present.</div>

<div class="content">Some additions to the above:<br><br>Louise Hay advocates "mirror work" (encouraging and loving yourseld) <a href="http://www.healyourlife.com/blogs/louise-hay-blog/mirror-mirror-on-the-wall" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.healyourlife.com/blogs/louise-hay-blog/mirror-mirror-on-the-wall</a><br><br>NLP for the car commute:<br><br>on my commute I experiment with using parts of the car as NLP "anchors" - I find an open road and when safe I can daydream; gently projecting my future ideal self onto the windscreen, my inner dialogue I imagine coming from the speakers, and the boot is the baggage I no longer need. I visualise the air flow and light flowing thru my body to clear the cells of junk. You get the idea.<br><br>Personally I believe speaking and writing help turn the mental and emotional toward the physical for creating the future.<br><br>For pure creativity exercises I enjoyed Julia Cameron's "Vein of Gold" which has many exercises which are great fun.<br><br>For me self-coaching and NLP state change and journaling have been life-improving skills.</div>
