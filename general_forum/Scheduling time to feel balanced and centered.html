<div class="content">I believe I work better when I'm feeling alert and rested. So I plan to take time to feel better. It needs to be a recurring intention. It gets implemented by combinations of<br><br>- some stretches or at least regular physical activity away from the desk. I have even done press ups for a few minutes each day. Some yoga stretches at the desk are good to.<br><br>- 1 minute meditations of me on a beach or somewhere lovely and relaxing. It slows the TPM (thoughts per minute) gauge.<br><br>- slow breathing - excellent for calming and centering<br><br>- a short jog round the block - just to expel surplus CO2 from the lungs and get metabolism moving again<br><br>- NLP (Neuro Linguistic programming) tools for changing thought patterns and responses to them<br><br>I realise this may not be the traditional self-punishing drive to achieve without stopping that some TM systems encourage. It may be a sensible approach to death-by-overwork prevention ("Karoshi" in Japan - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kar%C5%8Dshi)." target="new" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kar%C5%8Dshi).</a> I aspire more to Bertrand Russell: "I think that there is far too much work done in the world, that immense harm is caused by the belief that work is virtuous, and that what needs to be preached in modern industrial countries is quite different from what always has been preached." (In Praise of Idleness)</div>

<div class="content">Except that I don't use scheduling, planning, intention, meditation, breathing, NLP, nor Russell's ideas, I agree.  <br><br>I have on my list to take a break.  When such stands out, I stop working for a bit and relax.  There's also a time when I set down the list entirely, and say I'm done working.</div>

<div class="content">Regular exercise and socializing are part of my list. I know I can safely skip them for a bit, but it quickly becomes a slippery slope. Staying away from that slope is important, especially since I'm trying to climb a mountain. That makes doing them urgent enough to get attention. It also rewards rather than punishes when I take a break from "real" work. Sometimes I take a real break, but often something else on the list will do -- such as singing practice or spending five minutes making the bathroom presentable.</div>
