<div class="content">I'm trying to figure out how to use AF4 with my tasks that have due dates. As I have posted elsewhere, I always have tasks that can be done today, but must be done by x (usually within a week).<br><br>I have been writing my due dates next to the the task in order to ensure it is completed on time. The problem is that I inevitably go straight for the tasks that have due dates. For example, if I have two tasks that are due tomorrow in my open list (active list), I am going to skip over everything else and do the first one, then skip everything again and do the second one. In the back of my mind, I know those pending tasks are there, so the other tasks don't seem "ready to be done." The problem is, according to AF4 all my closed list (backlog) items now have to be re-entered or deleted.<br><br>This doesn't feel like the way the system was intended - I end up re-entering tasks over and over again. Is there a better way to do this? I don't want to use a separate system for my tasks with due dates. Is AF4 just not for me?</div>

<div class="content">Hm, I also write due dates next to the item.  Usually like this:<br><br>- Status report (due Tues)<br><br>I don't set off the due date in any special column or use a special color or anything.  It just "blends in" with the task itself.<br><br>Generally this works just fine, and I don't assign any special importance to the task until I actually READ it and see "Oh there's a due date", which sometimes gives me that extra urge to do some work on it, and sometimes doesn't.<br><br>I've done it this way since AF1, and it's always worked pretty well.  <br><br>Anyway, since it sounds like you are using the same method but getting different results, I'm not sure if my comments here are useful for you.  Maybe if you just keep working with AF4 and keep writing deadlines the same way, eventually you'll get used to it and they will stand out the way they are supposed to stand out, rather than always triggering the Tyranny of the Urgent.</div>

<div class="content">Hi JTKaspar!<br><br><<I have been writing my due dates next to the the task in order to ensure it is completed on time. The problem is that I inevitably go straight for the tasks that have due dates.>><br><br>JTKaspar, I think the reason you keep going back to those tasks is because you know WHY you are doing them.  Mark Forster said in "Keeping one's markers aligned"<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2009/9/1/keeping-ones-markers-aligned.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2009/9/1/keeping-ones-markers-aligned.html</a><br><br>that when you get at least two goals aligned you will have greater focus on what you are doing. <br><br>Now look at what you did for your tasks with dated deadlines. I have to guess you have your AF list like this:<br><br>>> Do project A (9/15/09)<br>>> Clean house<br>>> Do project B (9/20/09)<br>>> Check email<br><br>When I look at that list, I have to say that my eyes, and I think anyone's eyes, will go automatically to the dated projects because the reasons for doing these tasks are there: they are aligned goals.  Using Mark Forster's terminology in the blog entry "Keeping one's markers aligned":<br><br>---> Do Project A ---> finish by 9/15/09<br>---> Do Project B ---> finish by 9/20/09<br><br>While the other tasks will be skipped by anyone's eyes because they are just individual goals with no other aligning goal<br><br>---> Clean room<br>---> Check email<br><br>However, if we add an additional goal to each individual task, in the same way we note the deadlines beside the dated tasks:<br><br>>> Do project A (9/15/09)<br>>> Clean house (visiting friends)<br>>> Do project B (9/20/09)<br>>> Check email (prevent backlog)<br><br>then my eyes (and I guess your eyes too, and anybody else's) treat each task equally, and thus the list can be more objectively judged.<br><br>---> Do Project A ---> finish by 9/15/09<br>---> Clean house ---> make home presentable for visiting friends<br>---> Do Project B ---> finish by 9/20/09<br>---> Check email ---> prevent backlog of emails<br><br>So my suggestion is keep those dates beside the dated projects, they are effective in reminding you of the importance of those projects.  Then, add goals to each of the OTHER tasks in your lists so that you can judge the entirety of your list, not just the dated projects, objectively and efficiently.<br><br>I have previously discussed using marker goals for AF in this link<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/886499" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/886499</a><br><br>I hope all this helps ^__^</div>
