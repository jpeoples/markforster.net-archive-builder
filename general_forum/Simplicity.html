<div class="content">Mary in another post mentioned her old system of writing in spiral notebooks prior to finding this site.  Years ago I also  used to use a similar method and wrote about it in an ebook.  At the company I work at now virtually everyone uses spiral notebooks versus legal pads which are pervasive in most companies in the US.  I have noticed that the people at this firm are more productive than at many other places I have worked where people are writing on legal pads or not at all.  I am wondering if it due to the simplicity of having everything in one place.  No matter if you are using AF, the system I outlined or another the reality is all you have to do and think about is in one place, so as long as you are writing in the notebook, reviewing this notebook regularly and taking action you will be productive.  I have noticed most of the tweaks I have used have not improved on the simplicity of writing in one place.  As I have pulled out notes to file them and put project lists in other places, it has just served to cause me to have more places to look for things and more things to look at reducing time to actually do things and increasing the anxiety I have thinking I am not remembering all I have to do.  <br><br>If Mark's new tweak incorporates a form of project tracking/management into it I will give it a try, if not, I think I will just continue on with the Simple Guide to Time Management method.<br><br>Anyone else have a spiral notebook based time management system to share?<br><br>Thanks<br><br>Gerry<br><br></div>

<div class="content">H Gerry,<br><br>That is absolutely the KEY to any good system ... permanence and a single locus!<br><br>That said, there is some flexibility that may prove useful.  My "ultimate" system was in several parts and a bit complex as it evolved over the years.  Briefly it was composed of:<br><br>- A spiral notebook.  This was the anchor of the system.  I eschewed the whole idea of "scratch paper"!  When I first started a new book I'd number every right hand page with odd numbers, leaving five pages in front blank for reference material and an index of important entries.  I'd also tape phone books to the inside cover, etc.  Every entry had a pointer to previous conversations and subsequent conversations so I could quickly follow the "chain".  I had a system of codes for entires to speed up notation.  Oh, it was quite elaborate ;-)<br><br>Every thing went into that book.  BUSINESS AND PERSONAL!  This was crucial to me.  One book, one place ... for everything!  I never had more than one place to look for something.  If it was not in my book, it was not current and so was filed and I (and anyone else) could look it up alphabetically in the file cabinet.<br><br>Business cards were taped in ... they did not go into a Rolodex that would always be on my desk when I needed the card in some other city.  Even phone messages if they had useful info on them were taped in there.  I can't tell you how much credibility I had when I read from my notebook and people saw the original phone message taped right there.  I was never questioned about the facts of anything.  It saved all kinds of argument.  Even over the phone, people can tell that you have it all written down in front of you in contemporaneous notes.  (From time to time I also used a bound notebook.  I liked that they did not have the wires to hang up on things.  But I did not like that they were not hole punched so could not fit in my binder ... see below.)  Oh, and periodically I'd photocopy the pages and keep them filed in the first file in my file cabinet ... just in case.  (I'd put a check mark by the page number to indicate the page had been photocopied so I'd know where I left off.)  When you commit to a universal notebook you just HAVE to photocopy it.  (If I were doing this today, I'd scan it into EverNote so I'd have instant access anywhere if I were without it.)<br><br>- I also had a ring binder which contained my calendar and 43 tabs for upcoming info.  I would snap my spiral book into that when I was on the move so I had only one thing to carry.  My calendar was in this book but my TO DO list was also in my spiral book.  When I planned my day I would put my meetings and TO DO items on the top of the spiral "log" so I had them always in front of me.  My calendar was for planning purposes only.<br><br>- When I got a memo it might go into the ring binder if it needed to be referenced quickly.  If not, it would go into a chron file so I knew were to find it ... it might possibly be photocopied and put into a project folder ... that just depended.<br><br>- My format was 8.5" x 11" because most of the paper I handled was in that format.<br><br>- I had punched plastic sleeves in the binder for things like airline tickets.<br><br>My binder with my spiral book was right on top of other things in my brief case.  If I had tickets or reservations, they were in a plastic sleeve in my binder right under the date.  No last minute worries about if I brought the tickets.  I even had my passport in a pocket in that binder.  I literally could redirect a cab and be on the next plane to a foreign country with no notice.  I could buy more socks when I got there, if needed, but I could not make up for missing info.<br><br>Now, in fairness, this was in the days of old before the ubiquitous notebook computer.  But I think I'd still keep to my spiral book and use things like EverNote for back up and voluminous documentation.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Mike - that's one impressive system!<br><br>Would love to see some pictures but I know you don't like Flickr .... and I still have to post some pictures but kep resisting Flickr ..... :-(</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine,<br><br>I don't use that system any longer as I'm retired from the rat race.  I may have a more detailed explanation of it somewhere that I could share.  I'll take a look around.</div>

<div class="content">Hello Mike. <br>I would be also very interested to see some picture about your system. expecialy the spiral notebook. How you did things. The best system are system we use. Complexity leads to desaster. So, if you can show us something it would be a pleasure to see it !</div>

<div class="content">Gotta laugh at how quickly this thread got away from topic. <br><br>I use a Moleskine. <br><br>Spiral notebooks get caught up with stuff and I am left handed. The desire to use a legal pad has always been there, because it is easier to write in as a left-hander, but not as easy to skim through.<br><br>AF, with the occasional post-it for emergent items I want to do immediately.<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Being highly productive has less to do with how you capture things than the type of person you are and the nature of your work, I think.<br><br>At a previous job, I wrote everything on the back of recycled paper that I kept in a stack beside my monitor.  It was very rare that I had to look at my notes.  And I was very, very productive.  :-)</div>

<div class="content">Norman,<br><br>You must be rolling in dough.  In a business environment I filled up a notebook ever few weeks or so.  Remember, this is not a TO DO list we are talking about ... it is a total work management system.  Every phone call, every meeting, every set of design notes went in there.  It would not be uncommon to fill up five or ten pages a day -- both sides!  At Moleskine prices I'd have had to take out a second mortgage on the house.  OTOH, the company usually supplied spiral notebooks!<br><br>Of course, I could line up hundreds of Moleskines on a shelf with carefully lettered titles on the spines and point to them to awed visitors but I think my management would have urged me to use my psychiatric medical benefit at that point.<br><br>As to using AF in a work environment, I'd see that as playing a minor part.  In my work environment, I was always in a meeting or working on a document or program to meet a deadline.  I pretty much knew what I had to do and it was just a matter of when it was due and doing it.</div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline,<br><br>I agree that in general terms that is true.  Productivity is about what you do, not what you plan to do.  OTOH, if we are talking about a total work management system (as the original poster was) there is more to it than a TO DO list.  As I said, it is about recording information so that it can be accessed quickly and not get lost.  It is about knowing who said what to whom about which and when so that when a vendor says: "I never promised that." you can call him on it and get what you paid for.  In an environment where many things are a mater of interpretation this can be important.  Sure you write a nice contract with detailed specifications ... but there are always things which don't make it there.  "Hey, you said that the response time would be under a second and it is.  But you also said your system would be stable and it crashes twice a day which blows the value of that response time all to hell.  This was to be resolved last week, remember our conversation wherein you said...?"<br><br>That kind of management system does not lend itself well to scraps of paper.  IOW, if what you are doing is done when it is done, then a scrap of paper is fine.  If what you are doing has something of a "life", then you have to hang on to information until the whole "project" is over or you're toast.</div>

<div class="content">Mike, in my previous world, we had a lot of staff turnover and projects that didn't end. Having well maintained files was a crucial part of the process - if the files don't work, they're not set up or maintained properly.  If you're working on the 2008 year-end, the notes for the previous year-end better be in the 2007 year-end binder / files - not stuck in someone's notebook who has since moved onto another job.   <br><br>That's why I said that it depends on the nature of the work, although I think anybody's work can be benefited from having that kind of filing system - it's just more critical in some environments.  <br><br>If I was making notes on my 2009 taxes filed, they'd better be in my 2009 tax folder so I can find them - to put them anywhere else is kind of ridiculous, isn't it?  And yes, sometimes those notes will be on a post-it note or a scrap of paper.  ;-)<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Mike I have to say that the idea of the neatly lined up notebooks holds appear for me - guess someone needs to send for the little men in white coats! LOL<br><br>I tend to have managed my paper much like Jacqueline but had frequently attempted to maintain one book for notes, sort of along the line you mention Mike, but not in such a structured way.  In all honesty though AF is the first notebook I have maintained consistently, usually having two or three on the go at once, together with various haphazard papers. (which do hopefully get into the right files during my filing blitzes).<br><br>I am particularly fascinated by how you managed your indexing and cross referencing - hope you can find some pictures or post some more details - perhaps in a different thread to avoid us going too off track in this one :-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Folks,<br><br>Simplicity -- that is what I have experienced since I have embraced AF -- and in a paper notebook.  I was once entirely digital -- and still maintain my calendar entirely in Outlook 2007 as that is what my university uses and I must maintain my schedule here due to administrative responsibilities.  I have a pda that synchs with my Outlook, so I have my schedule at all times with me.  But my tasks and projects -- now all in a paper notebook.  I cannot begin to tell you how refreshing and enjoyable it has been to do AF in a simple, spiral notebook!  <br><br>I do keep a separate list of my projects and major commitments.  I also embrace GTD's horizons and keep a list of my Areas of Focus.  This is important as it helps me to try to keep some balance in both my professional and personal life.<br><br>Gerry, the pdf on "Simple Time Management" is very well done and very similar to AF and what I do now.<br><br>To me...doing things in a simple, spiral-bound notebook -- and following AF -- has been wonderful.<br><br>Best wishes to All,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Ranier, yes that is it.<br><br>David, thanks for the comment.  I actually wrote the ebook using some of my ideas as well as some of the ideas from GTD and DIT.  It was an attempt to create something very simple yet include a way to manage projects as well as track waiting for items which was a GTD concept but I tracked as well before I read GTD.<br><br>The idea behind writing it was actually to have a product to give away as a way to promote another ebook for sale, which I have yet to finish, but hope to have done in a month or so.<br><br>Gerry.</div>
