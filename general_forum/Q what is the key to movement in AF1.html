<div class="content">I have been having some good success with AF1. I really enjoy the way that the system alerts me to things that I am procrastinating on or else not ready to move on. Does anyone have any advice on whether to dismiss or re-enter items? Do many people transfer dismissed items to another list? or leave in your notebook as a reminder for later?<br><br>Best,<br>Erik</div>

<div class="content">Only re-enter things if you started but didn't finish.  <br><br>I delete stuff I dismissed.  Others mark them so they can review later.  I don't see any reason to make a new list.</div>

<div class="content">Erik,<br><br>I'm assuming that you are not talking about partially completed tasks ... those are immediately reentered at the end of the list (last page).<br><br>If you do a true "dismissal" it happens because there are no tasks on the page that you wish to do.  You highlight those and do NOT reenter immediately.  You wait a while and then review the dismissed pages to see if there are any highlighted tasks that you now feel ready to do ... THEN you add them to the end of your active list.  But only do so once you understand WHY they need to be done and WHY they did not get done before.</div>

<div class="content">Oh, one more thing occurred to me while I was in the shower (don't ask ;-)  Someone here has proposed putting a bang (!) in front of reentered items (which I believe he called "rescued" items ... a more apt name, I think).  That serves to alert you that this is their second chance so you REALLY ought to get on the stick with them.  I'm sure any symbol or even highlighting with a special color would accomplish the same thing.</div>

<div class="content">I used to highlight tasks that I don't get around to, but as of late, I've been liberal in crossing them out. If they don't stand out enough for me to save them by just partially working on them, I just throw them out. They don't deserve my attention.<br><br>It's oddly liberating.</div>

<div class="content">JD and Alan have the right of it in my mind.<br><br>To me, the dismissal aspect of AF is one of its most powerful. <br><br>It is what helps keep you honest, humble, and realistic about what truly needs your help.<br><br>Sometimes, it is reasonable to highlight and give some thought to an entry that has been dismissed. Perhaps the entry wasn't quite what needed your help, perhaps it was something related. Let your gut be your guide, not your head, nor your heart.<br><br>Dismiss, dismiss, dismiss. I found that following the dismissal rules ruthlessly, that I dismiss less and less. Is this because I am more "productive"? I doubt it. It just I have a more realistic view of what stands out to be entered initially on the list.<br><br>If something is dismissed, that doesn't mean that "task" will leave your attention forever? It might caught your attention again in the future and find its way back onto the list.<br><br>My advice is to stick with the practice long enough and give it as honest a try as possible and see what happens you try to give up "forcing" yourself to do what you think needs to be done and let things stand out on their own.<br><br>Good luck!</div>
