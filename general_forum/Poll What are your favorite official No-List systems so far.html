<div class="content">May 9th, Spinning Plates, SMEMA, No List FVP, and the mental no-list system I'm fine-tuning now.</div>

<div class="content">Austin:<br><br>I'm with you on May 9th and No-List FVP. Two very nice systems. I think Spinning Plates though is a non No-List system designed mainly for projects. I think Mark mentioned it being related to No-List systems though.</div>

<div class="content">Austin:<br><br>I found Mark's comment about Spinning Plates being very closely related to, but not an example of a No-List system:<br><br>Austin said:<br><br>"I haven't seen it acknowledged before, but Spinning Plates is a no-list system."<br><br>Mark replied:<br><br>"Spinning Plates is based on the Rotating System, on which I designed about four different no-list systems. So it's very closely related to them."</div>

<div class="content">Michael,<br>I do not think Mark said definitively whether Spinning Plates is itself a no-list system in his conception. Although it predates his coining the term and concept, it nevertheless bears all the characteristics of a no-list system. It is a short list that automatically restricts itself from growing by limiting itself to things you are actively working on within a short space of time.</div>

<div class="content">I think what stops it being a proper no-list system in my conception is that a no-list system is essentially short in length and short-lived. Spinning Plates on the other hand is basically a permanent list once you've set it up and it can be quite long.<br><br>The other thing it is not is a catch-all system.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br>Good point, but you shared several versions of Spinning Plates, and while one of them did carry over days, the one I used was started fresh each day. As for the list growing long, it can only grow as long as you can consistently be up to date on all the tasks, which is the same for May 9. But I suppose it doesn't matter what we call it but whether it works.</div>
