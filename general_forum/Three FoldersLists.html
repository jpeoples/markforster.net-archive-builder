<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">I've been an advocate of using a physical paper-based Tickler file -<br><br><a href="http://wiki.43folders.com/index.php/Tickler_file" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.43folders.com/index.php/Tickler_file</a><br><br>- also know as the 43-Folders system.  I actually use two - one at home and one at work. It keeps me organized and I don't forget much or need to search for things nearly as often as before I implemented this system.<br><br>Recently, I've tried to implement an e-version of this system, for general task management.  Most to-do apps have options for tagging, labeling, and adding a deadline to each task. So it's not really necessary to segregate the items into 43 different categories or lists. <br><br>Still, it's nice to have a few buckets that make sense. So I am now keeping only three lists:<br><br>• Today<br>• Tomorrow<br>• Later<br><br>Within each list, I add whatever info is necessary to remind/alert me for tasks that need attention at a specific date/time. At the beginning of each day, the Tomorrow list moves to Today, and I consider which Later tasks to move to Tomorrow. It's easy to push tasks I can't finish today to the Tomorrow list.  Having a sense of what's on tomorrow's plate is helpful - not sure I need any longer-duration buckets such as week, month, or year. So I guess this approach is in the spirit of DIT.<br><br>I have switched from Clear.app to Apple's Reminders.app (both on macOS & iOS). I loved the former, but it has become abandonware, and the latter syncs better with iCloud.<br><br>Comments?</div>

<div class="content">Doing the same thing using Trello. I love that I put calendar items on the tomorrow day, then they get bumped up when tomorrow becomes today. Lets me mentally prepare for them!<br><br>One problem, isn't really with the system but with my follow-through, is: when items aren't done on todays list I sometimes just let the today & tomorrow stay the same. This can lead to tomorrow never coming!</div>

<div class="content">When i tried that, I used absolute dates rather than relative. That way, I didn't have to rename the files each day.<br><br>I found assigning dates didn't work. I would end up with too many tasks in some folders, and I can't predict my energy and focus levels.<br><br>I prefer sorting by leverage. (Actually codes in my master list rather than separate lists, and a secondary code if there's a limited window.) I review my high leverage tasks frequently and remain flexible.</div>

<div class="content">I tried 43 folders for things like tickets, that didn't have a separate project file. There weren't enough of them to bother, so now I keep them in my unpaid bills file. They're safe, and I see them often enough to remember where they are.</div>
