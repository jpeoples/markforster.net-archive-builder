<div class="content">I've been using AF for a week now and it's working really well.<br><br>I have found that AF is great at handling the short to medium terms things, but I wondered how other people feel it works with their Long Term Aims?<br><br>The obvious answer to this is that by doing the small things the big things take care of themselves and arrive eventually. AF is very good at breaking things down in to small manageable chunks.<br><br>However, is this enough to guide us to our bigger goals? Is there not a threat of focusing on too much detail instead of the bigger picture?<br><br>How do others integrate long term goals? Interested to know peoples thoughts.</div>

<div class="content">I think it helps you focus on what goals/commitments you are willing to keep up with.  So if you have a goal of learning Spanish, you could put that on your list.  When the task "learn Spanish" jumps out at you you'll either break it down further by listening to Spanish-language podcasts, researching classes, etc.  This will continue as you realize your goal,  OR the search for a class may be dismissed because you will that while it might be nice to learn Spanish, you really don't have the time/level of commitment necessary to tackle it and you'll focus on other goals/commitments.<br><br>If you look at your list right now, I'll bet you could divide the tasks into your main goals.  Most of mine at the moment are related to work, graduate school and family/friend concerns and those happen to be my goals at the moment.  When I finish grad school my goal will be to secure a new position, so my tasks will begin to reflect that new goal.<br><br>Make sense?<br><br></div>

<div class="content">@Jim (Atlanta)<br><br>Now there’s a really useful idea.  Categorize a few pages worth of tasks and see where I’m heading, what unstated goals I’m spending my time on.  Making myself write down the categories that tasks fall into should be very informative.  Maybe for each task ask why, then why again and again as necessary to get to the true motivation for doing a task.<br><br>I’m guessing that would open my eyes to frivolous goals, and encourage me to identify some worthwhile goals and tasks that would go with them.<br><br>Thanks for the idea!</div>

<div class="content">Hi David, <br><br>I agree that for some people who haven't sat down and determined their goals, that AF could just leave them in response-mode rather than in creating-a-life-mode.<br>Over Christmas I developed my goals for the year as always, only this year I'm actually following through on them with AF.  This year I set some very large, visible goals for myself.  Three of them are (I picked a theme for the year):  <br><br>1) major home renovation, <br>2) decluttering 25 years of stuff accumulation in an environmentally friendly manner, <br>3) maintaining a neat and clean home.  <br><br>These might not be big goals for someone else, but are for me.  <br><br>I threw a bunch of items relating to these projects on my AF list on Jan. 5 - in fact, 18 of the 29 items on my first page are related to these goals.  All of the items on my 2nd page are related to these goals (this was my initial brain dump phase).  All of those tasks are either done or dismissed (for now).  By page 3, I was still brain dumping for my goals and started to list items for some of my minor goals (eg. August holiday).   <br><br>One thing I think I might do is to take some time out maybe once per quarter (like on a camping trip or similar) - take a break from the AF list for a day and review my AF list objectively, develop a new list of goals or modify existing goals and update the AF list accordingly - basically do another big brain dump depending on what's on my list by then.   I haven't felt it necessary yet, so we'll see.<br><br>It seems that the system itself could help in determining if a goal is right for you or not by whether or not you resisted it.   Nobody had to force Wayne Gretzky to go out and play hockey.  I'm a believer in the following the path of least resistance in some of these things.  (Read Michael Neill's stuff).<br><br>My goals this year are pretty concrete and all things that I really want and have wanted for a long time. I look forward to next year when I will be working on less concrete goals to see how I work with AF then.</div>

<div class="content">Zane<br><br>The technique of "To Do list analysis" is often a very revealing one and one that is often overlooked.  It was something I used to encourage my staff to do periodically (usually with a lot of resistance!) but the results were always interesting ..... :-)</div>

<div class="content">Zane,<br><br>The idea of categorizing what you are doing to see where you are headed is handeled in more detail in Alan Lakein's Book, one of the classics of time management: <br><br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Control-Your-Time-Life-Signet/dp/0451167724/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1235592787&sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Control-Your-Time-Life-Signet/dp/0451167724/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1235592787&sr=8-1</a><br><br>He starts with a major goal setting exercise which, if done right, will take a while ... several days to get it polished, but you'll have a good idea in a few hours.  Once you have those goals identified, he recommends that you pick the top ones and then decide what small first tasks can move you forward and then put then on your list as high priority items.<br><br>No matter how you intend to implement your time management, planning your life goals is a necessary first step, IMO, if you want to go somewhere in particular ;-)  I review and update my master list yearly, on my birthday.  I review my intermediate term goals weekly to be sure I stay on track.<br></div>

<div class="content">David<br><br>My long term goals end up in my Project Management system, as for me they need to be planned in the same kind of detail if they are to be progressed.  As I work with AF it becomes clear which tasks belong to goals or projects and, regardless of whether they started life in my project or goal list, or as a task in my AF list, they will at some point end up being defined in one and actioned in the other.<br><br>However it is important to remember that AF enables progression towards the things that we believe are important in our life.  Those things we are moving towards will be our life goals whether we have consciously determined them as such or not.  If we find that we do not like the path we are on then it is a good time to look at why we are doing the things that we are doing  ........ :-)</div>
