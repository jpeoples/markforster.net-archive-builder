<div class="content">I want to learn shorthand and really should practise 20 minutes every day. I put it off (productive procrastination) all day until there were 25 minutes left before the kids arrived home.<br><br>At that point I thought, "I can put it off another five minutes, or I can start it now and get in an extra five."<br><br>The thought of an extra five minutes of something I was going to do anyways made me start right away. I think it was because that five would be productive rather than filling time until the last minute.</div>
