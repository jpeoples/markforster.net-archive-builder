<div class="content">The Boy and the Filberts<br><br>A Boy put his hand into a jar of Filberts, and grasped as many as his fist could possibly hold. But when he tried to pull it out again, he found he couldn't do so, for the neck of the jar was too small to allow of the passage of so large a handful. Unwilling to lose his nuts but unable to withdraw his hand, he burst into tears. A bystander, who saw where the trouble lay, said to him, "Come, my boy, don't be so greedy: be content with half the amount, and you'll be able to get your hand out without difficulty."<br><br>— Do not attempt too much at once. <br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Very funny!  A perfect illustration of the importance of tackling things "little and often".<br><br>(I know this post is quite old but I only just saw it - and it's worth reviving anyway.)</div>

<div class="content">acedia, I don't know if it's so much little and often, although that's probably part of it - I thought of this fable in trying to cut my AF list in half by trimming my commitments and projects I was taking on (my filberts).  :-)<br><br>Funny the things you can remember reading when you're 4 or 5 years old.<br></div>
