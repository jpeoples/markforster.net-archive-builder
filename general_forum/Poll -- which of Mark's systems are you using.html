<div class="content">Just to see where all of the great people that come to this site stand, which system of Mark's do you use?  How many DIT people are there?  Autofocus 1, 2, 3, 4?   And of course, now how many DWM users?<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">DWM.<br><br>Although I am still re-reading DIT and may try it out.  I originally ordered DIT in December 2008 and just as I was near finishing it, out came the beta instructions for AutoFocus, so I never really experienced DIT.  I'm definitely getting more from the book the second time around, and I was really motivated after reading Chapter 3, "Creative, Ordered and Effective."</div>

<div class="content">I think the poll is biased as the new system is the hot discussion. It remains to be seen how many will stick with DWM. I expect I will stick with it (or something related), but it's only now that the pressure of the auto-advancing tasks is starting to hit.  Give it two weeks and I think a number of people may find that pressure hard to manage.  <br><br>Me, I think this pressure is exactly what I need - to really focus on the essential.</div>

<div class="content">Yep -- could be biased....not exactly a scientifically sound survey instrument.  But interesting, nevertheless.  I agree completely about the advancing tasks front on people.  Should be interesting around here over the next couple of weeks....<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">DWM - on paper and only one notebook for all locations (items are colour coded by location)<br><br>I guess I'll stick with DWM because with the time-based dismissal it's possible to mix locations. I have a "non-location" that got neglected because I can do it everywhere and resist it everywhere. Up to now, mixing and colour coding works better than anything I tried with any AF version.</div>

<div class="content">DWM using Toodledo and sync'd with iPhone app. Still looking for a web+iphone combo that works reliably and can create a "closed list" feel which is still lacking with Toodledo. Having said that, this has worked for me so far with few tasks actually being dismissed. The pressure of dismissal has been good to me. <br><br>I will have to look into DWM+CI mod.</div>

<div class="content">DWM with Current Initiative in MLO (MyLife Organized). I like the forward fokus of DWM a lot. <br><br>It was very easy to move my AF4 implementation to DWM in MLO.  I like the clean electronic implementation as I have a very shaky handwriting and also cannot stand looking through crossed out lists. MLO has an option to hide done (strike through) tasks - perfekt. Also it saves me a lot of typing as I can easily enter recurrence for tasks I have to do regularly.<br><br>What I'd like to have is a monthly view for the tasks similar to the Outlook calendar monthly view.</div>

<div class="content">A medley of techniques, in between a heavy meetings schedule at work.  Overall organisation  is based on GTD in a loose leaf organiser; for my emails I use DIT; my task list is like AF3 but with a weekly structure so it resembles a weekly not daily version of DWM (like Zane). I identify my Most Important Tasks for this week/next week, and have a Must Do Today list if needed. My time at my desk is often spread between MITs, AF and emails by timed bursts and task sandwiches!  Sounds exhausting but it works for me. Thanks to everyone on this forum for the ideas and insights which have helped me refine this over the past year.</div>

<div class="content">I tried DWM on paper and it was great so I tried to implement it digitally without losing the advantages of paper (don't delete done tasks, and have the calendar feeling).<br>I managed to do this with google calendar, and like lazy cat I have a list for all contextx. Writing /W for work tasks and /H for home tasks before the task. When a task is done I write 3 dashes "---" before and it is clear enough.<br>I can see how many times and in what order I did something and that is very nice.<br>When I create a task I always make it all day because it is easier to read on some applications on android. <br>I'm eager to get to the first month point.</div>

<div class="content">DWM. I tried the standard way & liked it but am now experimenting with using it in my AF4 book by doing the 7 day & one month cut-offs backwards. So far it seems to work. Carried forward tasks get a different bullet and they must be crossed off within 7 days. The balance must be done within a month. The advantage for me is that I can continue to use the same book for notes/journal entries, minutes etc, in addition to recording tasks.</div>

<div class="content">DWM electronically on MLO, and I am surprised by the fit. For AF, nothing except paper would do, but for DWM, it has been a pleasure to use my favourite software. <br><br>Projects go right into DWM now, and each task get the project name appended to it. Notes, hyperlinks, and snappy entries of recurring tasks - I am enjoying all the benefits of an electronic implementation.<br><br>I was worried about missing the tactile feel, and losing the creative thinking edge (if I have any at all!) from typing on a key board, but so far, I must say, it has been good. I still have my notepad in front of me, and write things for tasks requiring planning and thinking, so I guess I am still having that experience.</div>

<div class="content">AF4<br><br>Never felt any attraction to DWM.  I rarely have more than 4 active A5 pages and when I draw my line periodically, I write the day of the week and the date on the line and make sure that I never allow more than a week to pass without dealing with all items above the line.<br><br>I recoil from the thought of having active items spread over 30 pages.

<div class="content">I'm using DWM, with Mark's new Current Initiative option.  I've loved DIT and all the Autofocus incarnations, but I think DWM will be the one for me long-term.  However, it's difficult to judge at this stage, and I feel that the true workings of DWM will only become clear once it's been used for several months.   I use paper, not electronics.  I can see the attraction, especially using a system like the one Andreas has come up with, but there's something special about using a notebook.</div>

<div class="content">AF4 tweaked with some of AF Revised.  Main tweak is going backward through the active list  and a similar handling of deletions.  But dominantly the AF4 approach.   I also recoil from having items spread out over 30 pages.  The major value of AF for me has been the concise listing of  issues that need working combined with a procedure that forces me to review them.   I have a career that is relatively "appointment" free (not totally).  Calendar-centric time management systems have always been counter-productive for me.</div>

<div class="content">DWM using ListPro so that I can synchronise with my Windows Mobile Device, I use a highlight for Closed List/Current Initiative.<br>  <br>Because of my travel lifestyle, I use contexts as well.  Tasks added during the day are first written on the one page paper report generated by ListPro for the day, then transferred into ListPro at the end of the day if not done.  This enables me to operate in paper mode when away from my computer.<br><br>Columns: Diary Date, Status, Task (can be expanded into sub-tasks, useful for projects and recurring daily/weekly/routine stuff), Flag, Done (checkbox), Context<br><br>Status: Closed List (this view is highlighted), New Entry (Today + 28), Re-Entry (Today + 7), Xpired<br><br>Context: @Anywhere (maybe I just leave these blank, will see), @Assignment Office, @Assignment Other (eg lodge, hotel, whatever), @Errands, @Home Office, @Home/UK, @Travel<br><br>Thus I can sort by context eg I can earmark a task or change an existing one if I want to do them at the airport, during flight etc and make them @Travel<br><br>Like others have mentioned in their own modus operandi, I dump completed and Xpired tasks into another file with the same columns etc, in case I want to review them later.<br><br>After a few weeks of this, I may look again at using MLO, unless DWM2 is been born?</div>

<div class="content">DWM since two weeks, on paper. I've very briefly experimented with electronic, but paper gives a sense of ownership of the list that I miss with any electronic implementation.<br><br>I've used AF1 since last April, switched to AF2, AF3 and AF4 when they came out, then switched to DIT three weeks ago. With DIT, I missed the flexibility of AF4, but needed the strict daily regime from DIT.<br><br>So far, I'm quite happy with DWM. I like the forced dismissal, and the fact that it signals much better to me when I'm taking on too much.</div>

So many here, including you, are finding such great success with DWM.  Also, there is the fact that DWM is an evolution of all Mark has worked on and designed -- DIT through all of the versions of Autofocus -- it is all here in some part within DWM.

<div class="content">AF4 in support of a DIT/ZTD/GSD hybrid. To be honest, I haven't even tried DWM.<br><br>Much of my work is time sensitive and reactive so writing out a month ahead is not really desirable, especially since my daily pages go to support reporting in what I have been doing.<br><br>A gridded steno notebook is my recording location for everything, work and personal, sort of like Mike's grass catcher.  I use columns to list the date of the entry and number each entry for tracking purposes. Another column, two grids wide is for noting who on my staff an item is delegated to (if I have to assign it more than twice, there's a problem). The next column is for placing an "X" to indicate completion of an item. The last column is a category column that I use single letter intitials to signify categories since I use batch processing in my assignments. Then comes the description of the item. 80% of this list is usually delegated. If I don't assign a category, the space is blank and means that it is something intended soley for me. <br><br>Each night I list my MIT's for the next day first, a la ZTD. then fill out the rest a la GSD. As things come in during the day, I will draw a line under my original list and treat it like DIT if it is something that must be done that day, otherwise, it goes into the steno notebook. Personal and work are mixed on the daily page and differentiated as a circle for personal and a square checkbox for work.  I start off the day on the daily page and will flip back and forth between the day book and the AF4 list as time and circumstances permit.</div>

<div class="content">AF3 with a tweak that I called "Ping-Pong-AF". On paper.<br><br>This works so well for me that I no longer follow this forum regularly... which explains I step in rather late. I guess that's the way it goes once you've found something that "clicked".</div>

<div class="content">DWM - at first I hated this but the forced deletion really works for me. Using it completely on paper even though I am a techy by nature.  Just started with the current initiative.  Because I have so many tasks; I am kind of cheating with a closed list on a calendar for those things that have real deadlines.</div>

<div class="content">Converting from AF4 to DWM at work on paper.  (At work I can't access any web apps or access files easily from home, so I'll never consider electronic.)  I say converting since I haven't dumped everything into DWM; I have a task to review my AF4 list.<br><br>I'm still worried about being off my DWM list for a day or two, especially if it is unplanned.  Renumbering would likely bump things into a weekend when they would be automatically  dismissed.  So I guess I would have to renumber by the number workdays instead of calendar days, at least for the first 5 workdays.<br><br>At home, AF4.  But I've hardly touched it in weeks.  As a result, I get almost nothing done at home.<br><br>AF4 worked very well at work (and at home until surgery and the holidays when I stopped doing much of anything useful).</div>

<div class="content">DWM using Todo from Appigo on my Ipod.  I don't think it's possible to tell how it's going to work for me until we're well past the one month mark.  I've worked through all of them from AF1 onwards, always on paper,  and find that  I start to feel harried and give the whole thing up after a while.  Currently I'm quite enjoying DWM but find that I don't 'throw everything at the list' so it doesn't get too big and burdensome.  I only put on things I really intend to do fairly soon.  The problem I'm having is that I'm working round and round the tasks which are due in the next week.  The later ones never feel important enough in comparison.  But I guess that will change as their dates get closer.</div>

<div class="content">Paper.  AF1... sort of...<br><br>Major changes:<br>Pages can be worked in any order.<br>Completely different dismissal rules.<br><br>My major goals are to keep on top of urgent tasks, to move big projects forward, and to trust the list.  I discovered that for me one of three things is usually the source of feeling overwhelmed:<br>1) Languishing tasks.<br>To keep the list fresh, dismiss a page once all its open tasks are over a month old. <br>2) Too many tasks.<br>To keep the list short, dismiss the oldest page if # open pages > "x".  For me, critical mass at the moment is 7, so you can see why I didn't even give DWM a chance.  My current rule is that when I start writing on the 8th page, the oldest active page is dismissed.<br>3) Flipping too many pages.<br>To keep the list tight, dismiss a page if its open tasks <=3.<br><br>How these rules tend to play out in the real world is that several times a day I "bounce" to the most current page or two to stay on top of urgent tasks, but spend most of my time closing out the oldest few pages except when something really "calls" me from the middle.  In general, my list consists of a few old pages with some lingering tasks, a few half-done middle pages, and one or two pages almost full of current entries.  Threat of dismissal encourages little and often.<br><br>Another lurker here finally chiming in.  I've worked them all except DWM.  Thanks, Mark, and all you regulars.  Your discussions have been a tremendous help!!!  A special nod to Andreas E. for Ping Pong AF1.</div>

<div class="content">Another first-time poster :)<br><br>I tried AF4 on both paper and electronically, and didn't like that I had to find a different solution for date-sensitive items, or that the AF4 lists tended to stay static for days (I didn't put everything on them because I couldn't have it arranged the way I'd like to see it), or electronic input formats.<br><br>I quickly saw that DWM could have potential, so I am giving DWM a try, using a small gridded notebook I had laying around.  I've been doing this for about a week now, so I've just gotten to my first date that had open tasks--one will be dismissed because I was able to decide I didn't want to read that book after all, and the others are either done or will be by tonight.  Tomorrow has more tasks still open, so we'll see how I feel after that.<br><br>I'm putting my tasks on the inner half of each page and any date-sensitive items (appts, mainly, but reminders of due dates eventually (with actual task being placed by DWM rules) on the outer margins, so that I can easily see what is scheduled for a day vs. my task list.<br><br>I haven't had any days were I couldn't use DWM yet, but I have a plan for what I will do.  Since I want to use the same pages for date-sensitive stuff (I know I won't trust a system that doesn't handle my calendar), renumbering won't work.  So when I have a break from the system, I intend to:<br>1) Go through and remove any pages before the current date that have no open items<br>2) Set "Day 7" and "Day 30" from the first day with tasks (which may be before current date)<br>3) Go through the lists and update any tasks that wound up getting done even w/out the system, reentering on new "day 7" as needed<br>4) Start using system with new "day 7/30"<br>5) As soon as the last item on a date before the current date is actioned, I will remove that page and change the "day 7/30" if needed<br><br>This should result in my being able to work through any backlog created by being away from the system without having to re-date pages, thus screwing up my calendar too.<br><br>If I actually have to use this tweak at some point, I can give an update about how it works.</div>

<div class="content">DWM with current initiative and pulling out MIT's as I make the first pass through the diary. All on paper. I also continue to run a tickler system for time sensitive future papers/tasks, which I incorporate when they pop out the system - I date them with a lead time to allow for completion). I keep my appointments in a separate planner. <br><br>As my diary is A4 and too large even for my bag to cart around with me. I am keeping my smaller moleskine notebook which i had for AF4 as my catch all for when I am out and think of things which I transfer when i get back in pure DWM timeframes. If I am away and know I will have time I will also include a note of any MIT's.<br><br>- Titch</div>
