<div class="content">Much of my life has been spent feeling I have too much to do.  I've looked for a time management system to help.  Recently I read a book titled something like the Magic of Tidying Up by a Japanese lady.  As a result I've thrown lots out and taken lots up to the local charity shop.  And I've started to radically prune what I feel committed to do.  And I was struck by the following thought:<br><br>When we feel overcommitted, the actions we need to take to get things feeling under control may well be different to the actions under a system to keep things under control.  Looking for a system that gets and then keeps things under control, may well damn, excellent systems as "not working".  When we have taken the remedial pruning action the system may work fine for keeping things under control.<br><br>Sadly I offer no insight as to how to get or stay under control, but I thought this insight was interesting and wanted to share.</div>

<div class="content">Man of Kent:<br><br>Thanks for the interesting insight.<br><br>Basically the action required can be summed up in two steps:<br><br>1. Sort.<br><br>2. Maintain.<br><br>To give an example I have recently sorted out my office. The way I've done it is to go through the office literally surface by surface and drawer by drawer. While each surface/drawer is being sorted, I've had a task "Tidy Office" which means that several times a day I restore each surface etc to its sorted state. i don't use "Tidy Office" for tidying the parts which haven't yet been sorted.<br><br>Exactly the same procedure can be used for reducing commitments:<br><br>1. Weed commitments<br><br>2. Restore commitments to weeded state (done daily)</div>
