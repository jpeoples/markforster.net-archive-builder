<div class="content">This is intended to be a list and discussion of all the drawbacks to scheduling blocks of time (self-appointments) for all of your tasks instead of working from a list at your discretion.</div>

<div class="content">The primary con to scheduling everything down to the minutia is that you will be unable to stick to it and will end up spending inordinate amounts of time repeating the scheduling process. It is, however, very effective to schedule a small number of high-impact activities a week.</div>

<div class="content">Two, you lack the flexibility to deal with people dropping by your desk or your manager giving you a short-tern assignment.<br><br>Three, you are stifled from getting into the flow working on something that grabs your attention.<br><br>Four, you cannot respond quickly to daily changes in priorities.<br><br>For certain work environments, these drawbacks might be acceptable. For engineers that work in teams in a complex factory environment with many short-term crises, they are not acceptable.</div>

<div class="content">Nice  Post ! On my own experience scheduling is crucial. As a commercial I schedule what I must do and most often I am reluctant too. But too much scheduling is difficult to repect. there are so many interuption, incalls and so on that it is difficult to respect my timing. Also priorities change. It is why I dont schedule to much in advance. Ie I planed last week 2 hours but another bulding arrived this week more interesting which needed all my atention. So I decided instead to work on it and reported on my list the other one. <br><br>Also we are all lazy and reluctant to do things. I never really understood the GTD principle about DO which is about ENERGY until I understood that sometime I am in the mood of planning, others on commercial, other thinking. This principle became so important that I thougy I could group task acording to the needs of energy it requires. I never tried this but it may work with me. <br><br>it reminds me when years go I planed every thing grouping stuff together. I spent a lot of time organizing and not enough time doing things so it never worked. But this is according my own experience. I am sure that web developpers spend time to do stuff for a limited time or days acting on projects relative to them urgencies. <br><br>So to clearly answer to the question Schedule Yes ! But if we can stay focus on the reality.</div>

<div class="content">The biggest problem with scheduling is usually that one doesn't leave enough time for interruptions, overruns, etc. As a guide when one starts off one should leave 20% of one's time unscheduled. This can be adjusted up or down as one gains experience.</div>
