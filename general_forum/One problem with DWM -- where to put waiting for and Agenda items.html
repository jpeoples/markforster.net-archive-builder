<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>I have encountered one problem so far with DWM -- where does one put waiting for and Agenda items?  I had my AF4 notebook setup like Alec Satin's shown in this link:<br><br><a href="http://blog.alecsatin.com/autofocus4/" rel="nofollow">http://blog.alecsatin.com/autofocus4/</a><br><br>There is a section at the end of the notebook where I kept all of these items and it was VERY functional to have all of these items in one place.  If I add these to the DWM lists, they will be scattered throughout the pages.  Any suggestions on how to deal with my many waiting for and Agenda items?  <br><br>Thanks,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Well....of course I could just use the last number of pages in my diary for this like I am now....duh....<br><br>Hmmm....maybe I need more rest....<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">David:<br><br><< maybe I need more rest >><br><br>Don't forget to put "Rest A While" as a task!<br><br>In answer to your original question, I keep lists for Agendas in Evernote. Waiting for items I put in the main list with a ? after them, e.g. "Joe replied to Email re Carton Sizes?" It gets crossed out either when Joe has replied, or when I decide to chase him.</div>

<div class="content">DWM seems extremely suited to embedding "waiting for" items.  If I delegate a task to somebody, I can simply re-enter the task as a waiting for on day 7.  So actually they'll only be scattered across 7 pages.  <br><br>If I get a response by then, I can easily find and remove it.  If I don't I'll be alerted within a week that I need to check up on what's happening.  <br><br>Agendas, follow Mark I guess.  I don't see a good way to put this in DWM yet.</div>

<div class="content">I décided to divide my pages in two (vertically):<br>on thé left, agenda's items (appointments, due on that specific day, trickers/ticklers)<br>on thé right, dit/af (what is the name now?) as explained by mark<br><br>IT works nicely, so far.<br>I'll adopt thé one week method, as explained above, starting tomorrow. <br>Thanksfor that idea.</div>

<div class="content">David,<br><br>I'm retired so I don't have a whole ton of "agenda" items ;-)  As I've descirbed before, I have seperate pages (in the back with the Composition book or now under different tabs in the Circa book) for each different list I need.  Those I use now are:<br><br>- Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Yearly events (NOT Mark's DWM list ... that has its own 3 tabs)<br>- Wife<br>- Waiting for<br>- Shopping<br>- Reading<br><br>I keep my projects in a different book ... one devoted to planning.  In my mind I see AF/DWM as a "scheduling" tool so I have it with my calendars, agendas, and other daily/shopping, etc. lists.  I keep my projects and planning in their own (and larger) book.</div>
