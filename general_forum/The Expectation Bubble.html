<div class="content">This is my label for the route we go down if our mind-set is unchanged. If we expect the same results and insist on the same oucomes as we have before.<br><br>By contrast I am reminded of the "Power of Now", which I take to be the chance to be free of habitual thought patterns and expand awareness, perhaps allowing options we would not have considered, or realising that what we thought we wanted we don't really need or truly desire.<br><br>Perhaps this is the dismissal process. Perhaps the list-creation process needs to be as deliberate, allowing the unexpected, relaxing our grip on what "ought" to be there. Allowing the inspired, the random.</div>
