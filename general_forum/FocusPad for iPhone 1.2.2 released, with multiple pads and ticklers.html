<div class="content">Hi all.<br><br>Just wanted to let you know that FocusPad 1.2.2 for Phone has just been released. It has support for multiple "pads", so you do things like keep work and personal todos separate, maintain a someday/maybe list, etc.<br><br>Moreover, you can schedule a date that a todo will move from one pad to another, thus providing the much-requested "tickler" feature. In addition to moving todos, you can also schedule a change to a todo's color and/or copy it to another pad, so you have a lot of flexibility. For example, a todo could turn red on a certain date to indicate it needs attention.<br><br>(Note that FocusPad does not yet support DWM. That will be coming in version 2.0. I don't have a release date yet, but hopefully it will be soon.)<br><br>..tony..</div>

<div class="content">In case this is of use to anyone, I thought I'd describe how I've recently set up FocusPad for my weekly version of DWM.  I use a week-at-a-view version of DWM in a filofax for my system at work, which is going well and providing a flexible but focussed list for each week. As a FocusPad fan, I wanted to try to recreate this for my personal system on FocusPad.  I like FP because of the simple interface, ease of accessing notes with tasks, and the notebook-like experience including swiping through the pages.  <br><br>On FocusPad I've created 2 long pages per week for the next month and 'reserved' the spaces to re-enter part done tasks when the page becomes week+1  by entering one character per spare line.  I entered all my tasks into the correct week from my previous implementation of DWM.<br><br>At the start of each week I reserve lines at the end of the old week+4 to make it up to 2x21 line pages, change the heading to week+3 and then start a new week+4 page.  I hide or delete the old current week's pages and obviously the old week+1 becomes the current week's closed list. I also draw a line under this week's DWM tasks & use any remaining lines for copying in other essential tasks to be done this week.  I also switch to short pages and hide the pages without any actual tasks on them yet which makes flipping through the weeks to the newer tasks easy.  <br><br>New tasks are automatically added at the end of the list on week+4 as normal, and I copy part done tasks and paste them into one of the reserved lines on week+1.  I admit this is a bit clunky by comparison, and I'm looking forward to seeing the results of Tony's next phase of development with this app to include DWM-ready features.  <br><br>Thanks Tony!</div>
