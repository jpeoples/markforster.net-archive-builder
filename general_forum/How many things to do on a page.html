<div class="content">The AF method is to study a page looking for tasks that stand out as ready for doing; and to stay on that page until no more tasks stand out.<br><br>Another approach would be to do, or dismiss, one task per page.  That would decrease the time to complete a round of visists to every page.  What drawbacks attend that alternative, such that it is not the recommended AF method?</div>

<div class="content">I thought the idea of Autofocus is to focus on one page, and work through the tasks that stand out until nothing on the page takes your attention.<br>Then you move on to the next page....<br><br>If you do one task per page then move on to the next page and pick a task,<br>you are spreading your "focus" much wider.<br><br>My $0.02 worth...</div>

<div class="content">The "one task per page" method is actually considered acceptable, especially you know there are urgent things you need to get to further down in the notebook. It's also useful for people who have so many pages, it could take several days, or even weeks for them to even look at them all using pure AF. <br><br>I think using pure AF is best. But the great thing about AF is it's flexibility. You can tweak it to meet your needs at any given time.</div>

<div class="content">Hi David<br><br>As Charles says you only "have" to do one task per page but will normally do more.  However you dismiss only when nothing on the page stands out.  Dismissing beforehand robs the subconscious of continued thought on the item, which, by the time you get back to the page might then stand out as ready.<br><br>I have had items on a page which I was sure I would end up dismissing but ultimately stood out on a later visit.  I also tried dismissing an item early but the highlighting was distracting each time I went back to the page, to the extent that I rewrote the page, and ultimately didn't dismiss the item after all!</div>

<div class="content">I think adopting the one-task-per-page as a permanent rule (rather than an exception to be followed on occasion, when you feel you need to get through your list faster than usual) would have several negative effects:<br><br>- AF would start to feel like one huge open list, rather than a series of closed lists.  You'd lose all the advantages of working through closed lists.<br><br>- Instead of slowly going down the page, and acting on an item if it stands out, you'd most likely get into the habit of scanning through the page and choosing the "highest priority" or "most important" item on the page.  It seems to me this involves a completely different kind of evaluation of task readiness, and wouldn't let the AF "standing out" magic to work.<br><br>- It would add more overhead -- after you complete a single task, you would always be required to scan through the whole next page of items, and choose only one item.  I personally would develop a huge resistance to that, I think, and probably abandon the system.<br><br>But maybe you are different and these kinds of things wouldn't impact you the same way they impact me.</div>

<div class="content">The main point of AF is IMHO that it gives room for our intuition. With a rule like "only one task per page" you are again restricting your intuition. Give it a chance! Let intuition decide when it's time to move to the next page.</div>

<div class="content">I've done the one task per page quite a bit in my home book and when I have, I notice I feel much more like I'm in *push* rather than *pull* mode.   I do it more to move through the 25+ pages more quickly to get to the things I feel are more urgent, but I prefer spending my time on the last 2-3 pages of the book on a more regular basis.</div>

<div class="content">Absolutely agree with Jacqueline - the "only one item per page" is a suggestion made in order to progress quickly through the lists if necessary.  It should be an ad hoc occurrence only, the exception rather than rule.</div>

<div class="content">These answers are helpful.  Thank you.  I find Seraphim's particularly persuasive.</div>

<div class="content">David:<br><br>Actually I did try the "one task per page" method for quite a considerable time while researching different ways of dealing with a list. My conclusions agreed very much with Jacqueline's and Seraphim's. <br><br>It also doesn't succeed in speeding things up in the least. Quite the opposite in fact. Since only one line can be dealt with on each pass, you will end up with a lot of pages. Imagine that on my last page I have three actions which I want to deal with in fairly quick succession, perhaps "Call Bill", "Call John" and "Call Eve about Bill and John's response". I call Bill, and then before I can call John I have to do something like 20 other actions, and another 19 before I can report back to Eve.</div>

<div class="content">I have a very difficult time in my work book however, in getting OFF the current active page, I seem to *feel ready* to do all of it, so I have had to push myself to get off of it when I know there are things I want to be doing on later pages that I've committed to.  I only have 5 active pages for my work book vs. about 22 for my home book - I need to figure out how to apply what works at the office to home.  :-)</div>

<div class="content">I am also having trouble getting through the whole list reasonably often.<br><br>If I were to reduce the number of items chosen on each page, should I be "raising the bar"  to make sure I don't simply pick the first candidate? Is anyone actually doing this?<br><br>Or is this too theoretical?<br><br>How many times a day are people cycling through their lists? I'm doing about once on a good day at the moment.</div>

<div class="content">Will - the rate you are cycling through your lists sounds absolutely fine.  Although it is preferable to be able to cycle through your lists quickly it does depend on the type of tasks and how long you spend on them.  I have very limited discretionery time on many days and sometimes, when I only have 10 minutes here and there, all I have time to do is make coffee and check the forum.  Other days I can get through up to 10 pages.  Sometimes it takes me a week to get through my lists - but that is ok.  The important thing is that I know what is on my lists and review them regularly.  I have to do more "do it now" items than I would like but that is the way my life is at present.  Even with my current time limitations AF works fantastically. <br><br>Don't worry about trying to speed it up if it is working for you as it is.  Just make sure that you know what is in your list, which if you are cycling through once every day or two I would imagine you have a pretty good handle on.</div>
