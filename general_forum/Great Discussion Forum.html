<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-01-16 22:39</div>
<div class="content">One of the best things for me about Autofocus & the discussion it has already generated this year has been reading about other people's experiences - & particularly realising how many people have lives like mine! - that is, multi-tasking, unusual employment patterns, a mixture of 'creative' stuff alongside more 'normal jobs - & it's proving really inspiring to read about it, & realise I'm not so odd after all!  Perhaps a lot of us with these rather unconventional, self-made lives have been drawn to Mark's way of looking at things in the past - that constant search to find the best way of 'getting everything done', while simultaneously knowing it's probably impossible...<br><br>A lot of us seem to be self-employed, but working in a variety of roles (personally I'm a biographer, plus a Royal Literary Fund Fellow helping students with their writing, plus the Clerk of a City of London Guild, plus a person who needs to get the laundry done, plus the collaborator with another author on a crime novel etc etc).  And it's been great to realise I'm not at all unusual in that sort of combination - as well as to find a system that seems to cater for it all better than anything else I've tried previously.<br><br>So thanks to all of you for your ideas & contributions, as well as to Mark for starting the whole thing off.</div>
