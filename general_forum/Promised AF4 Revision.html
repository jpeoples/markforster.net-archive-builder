<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-12-3 8:37</div>
<div class="content">Quite a long time ago I said that I was working on a revision of AF4. Since then I have been working away on it, and here it is. It's turned out to be very different from AF4, but has incorporated many of the things we have been recently discussing on the Forum. I have been finding the grouping of tasks into New, Old, Recurring and Unfinished extremely powerful.<br><br>Here's how it's done:<br><br>•	It's best to use a lined notebook. The size of the page and the number of lines doesn't matter too much. (I'm assuming in these instructions that you will be using paper and pen, but it's easy to duplicate electronically)<br><br>•	Start by heading three successive pages of your notebook "New", "Recurring" and "Unfinished" respectively.<br><br>•	Then on the first page write down about 10-20 tasks that you need to do, and draw a line under them. These are your initial "Old Tasks". As you think of other tasks or they arise in the course of your work, add them below the line. These are your "New Tasks".<br><br>•	Go through all the "Old Tasks" in order. Whenever a tasks feels ready to be done, work on it.<br><br>•	If you finish the task completely, cross it off the list. If it's a recurring task, re-enter it on the "Recurring" page. If you haven't finished the task, re-enter it on the "Unfinished" page. <br><br>•	At this stage you only work on the Old Tasks, ignoring the others.  Continue circulating through the Old Tasks until no more of them feel ready to be done for the moment. Now start working on the New Tasks (which are the ones below the line, remember).<br><br>•	When you've done as much work as you want to do on New Tasks for the time being, deal with the "Recurring" page and then the "Unfinished" page in the same way - except that there is no line dividing these pages. Once you have done all the tasks you want to do on the Unfinished page, return to the Old Tasks. You must do at least one task (hopefully more), otherwise all remaining Old Tasks are dismissed. Please note that only Old Tasks are liable to be dismissed. New Tasks, Recurring Tasks and Unfinished Tasks are not dismissed.<br><br>•	Once all the Old Tasks have been done or dismissed, a new line is drawn and the existing New Tasks are re-designated as Old Tasks.<br><br>•	Any time you fill a page with tasks, continue the same heading onto a new page. Then when you are working on each particular type of task circulate through all the pages with that heading.</div>

<div class="content">Good morning Mark!<br><br>Thanks for offering us up a new system to work with.  <br><br>My initial feeling is that I like the look of this. <br><br>Specifically, I like the grouping into 3 page types (I'm sure Gerry would approve too!) <br><br>I often start new projects and regularly do not finish them (at home anyway). Hopefully writing new tasks on the respective page will help me stay aware of new tasks I am taking on.<br><br>One question: Are you putting review / waiting for type items onto the 'unfinished' pages. My guess is that it would be similar to autofocus. I.e. put it on the unfinished page if it's due within a few days or write a calender review date if it's several weeks away. Is this so?</div>

<div class="content">Hello Mark,<br><br>Just a couple of things after a quick read through:<br><br><When you've done as much work as you want to do on New Tasks for the time being, deal with the "Recurring" page and then the "Unfinished" page in the same way - except that there is no line dividing these pages. Once you have done all the tasks you want to do on the Unfinished page, return to the Old Tasks. You must do at least one task (hopefully more), otherwise all remaining Old Tasks are dismissed.

I wonder if the three page types might not get mixed up and 'interfere' with the processing in that one will be paging through other page types looking for the next location of the type one is working on.<br><br>Maybe a notebook with moveable pages would be more suitable so that the New (with its Old tasks), Unfinished and Recurring tasks remain with each other.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Mark.  I'm going to jump right in and try it now.  <br>First task is "Separate current DWM2 list into Revised AF4 categories".<br>Best wishes.</div>

<div class="content">I like these new ideas for AF.  I just rebooted my AF list using some of Alan's ideas about separate project lists and am going through it using a post-it note to collect tasks when several attack my brain at once (a little like SAF and someone's (I don't recall who) separate moving page idea).  <br><br>Pulling things out into projects and leaving a note about the project and/or top tasks on the AF list is helping keep me more organized.  I think that pulling out recurring tasks will do the same.<br><br>Thanks for all the ideas!</div>

<div class="content">Sounds like how My System once worked.  It also had an AF4 list and separated out the unfinished tasks, and it worked well.  <br><br>A big difference is that you never dismiss Unfinished tasks or Recurring tasks.  This surprises me.  Where then is the push to clear Unfinished tasks?</div>

What, in your experience, are the relative strengths & weaknesses with your revised AF4 System compared with your other systems? >><br><br>I don't know that elegant is the right word. Having three different types of page and four different categories of task is not very elegant, but I think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.<br><br>The main advantages are that it makes it much easier to see where you are getting stuck and why, and gives you a greatly improved sense of how your work is progressing. If you find yourself getting bogged down in loads of trivial tasks, then you can slash the number of recurring tasks you have. If you have too many unfinished tasks, then you need to look at the number of time-consuming commitments you have made.<br><br>I also find that having Recurring and Unfinished tasks grouped helps me to deal with them more effectively.<br><br>Another effect is that the number of New Tasks is drastically reduced.

Where then is the push to clear Unfinished tasks?><br><br>This issue seems to highlight, to me at any rate, that ONLY tasks NEVER started can be dismissed, and that Mark is right to emphasise that being 'Unfinished' is the spur.  However, sometimes one has to realise that one particular task/project is past its sell-by date and diminishing returns on effort may have set in.<br><br>If so, what stops one from dismissing an Unfinished Task?  I cannot see any limitation, sometimes that's how life is.<br><br>Recurring tasks: by their very nature, each incidence of each task must be completed before it can be re-entered as a 'new' task, so I see no need for dismissal, unless again the usefulness of the task is past its sell-by date.<br><br>I think we are seeing the emergence of the (sometimes) subtle difference between a recurring task and an unfinished task.  It's the latter that bugs me!</div>

That wouldn't work in 3-T because a task that large would occupy the slot for weeks (or, as when I actually read War and Peace, years).</div>

<div class="content">Roger J:<br><br>I distinguish between dismissing a task, which is the result of a rule-based system, and deleting a task. In all my systems one is always free to delete a task at any time. This system makes it easier to audit one's list and delete tasks accordingly.</div>

<div class="content">This sounds promising!<br><br>There's one thing in Mark's instructions that I found a bit confusing: Mark says to set up three pages in the notebook with the headings "New", "Recurring" and "Unfinished".  The next instruction is to:<br><br><<...write down about 10-20 tasks that you need to do, and draw a line under them. These are your initial "Old Tasks". As you think of other tasks or they arise in the course of your work, add them below the line. These are your "New Tasks".>><br><br>But which page should this list of 10-20 tasks be placed on to?  I'm guessing that it should be the "New" page, though it could just as easily be the next blank page in the notebook, or somewhere else.  It'd be good to know exactly which page these tasks should go on...</div>

Are the New Tasks still worked on in this way? Or are they worked on the circulating stand-out principle (ie continue going around them until none stand out)?<br><br>If its the latter, then it appears to be a variance to the original AF4 way of working. The Closed List gets worked on in a circulating fashion, the Open List gets worked on in a single pass fashion in the original AF4.</div>

<div class="content">I had to go back and reread the directions when I got to that point, too.  I'm interpreting "in the same way" as meaning round and round until nothing stands out, only without the possibility of dismissal.  ("Please note that only Old Tasks are liable to be dismissed. New Tasks, Recurring Tasks and Unfinished Tasks are not dismissed.")<br><br>Mark?  What was your intent here?</div>

<div class="meta">2010-12-3 21:29</div>
<div class="content">Makes sense, thanks for clarifying!  That's definitely what I'm seeing... I dumped my whole existing list as "old" (I know, I know...) so it started at 40ish tasks... and right now at the end of one full working day I've got 23 Old, 6 New, 4 Recurring, and 5 Unfinished.</div>

<div class="meta">2010-12-3 21:34</div>
<div class="content">I found the same results (preponderance of recurring tasks, relatively small number of actually new tasks) when I broke up my DWM list into six categories:<br><br>Work Hotlist<br>Work Maintenance<br>Work Misc<br><br>Personal Hotlist<br>Personal Maintenance<br>Personal Misc<br><br>The Hotlists roughly equate to the Unfinished -- current key work that I'm trying to finish.<br><br>The Maintenance lists equate to the Recurring.<br><br>The Misc lists roughly equate to the New.   What I've found is that I actually look at these lists very rarely.  <br><br>New items that I initially add to the Misc lists, but then actually turn out to be really important, I just move them to the Hotlists.<br><br><br>I still keep those lists in Outlook, but I've been "driving" the whole system with a little SuperFocus notebook.  It prompts me to go check the different lists.  Often I just write hot tasks directly into SuperFocus.<br><br>Personally, I'd really be cautious about moving to this new AF4 revision, because it seems to lack the control of the SuperFocus 2nd column feature.  And my DWM backend system in Outlook works very similarly to the new AF4 revision already.</div>

<div class="content">Mark, any thoughts of integrating the SuperFocus 2nd column feature into AF4 revised?<br><br>Or, going the other direction, any thoughts of perhaps integrating the different page types into SuperFocus?   Seems like that would be pretty simple, actually.  You could just use the AF dismissal rules, rather than AF4 dismissal rules, and thus have only three types of tasks, New (never touched), Recurring, and Unfinished.  <br><br>Or any thoughts in general on how AF4 Revised compares with SuperFocus?</div>

<div class="content">What happens when the New page is full?  When the recurring or unfinished pages get full?  Seems to me in a notebook you start to get a mix of pages like new/recurring/new/unfinished/unfinished/recurring.  Will processing get awkward or do you mostly take it one page at a time?</div>

<div class="content">Alan:<br><br>Yes, you do get a mix of pages. My currently active pages are new/recurring/unfinished/new/new/recurring/recurring.<br><br>It sounds confusing, but in practice I don't find it so. If I'm working on New for example, when I get to the end of one New page I just page forward until I come to the next. It helps if the pages are clearly marked of course.<br><br>Another solution, as Roger J proposed earlier, is to use a loose-leaf notebook.</div>

<div class="content">Any system really benefits from a separation between New/Old/Unfinished (Projects) with Recurring (Maintenance). When a project is finished, it often creates roots that need to be tended to (maintenance) without our being conscious of it. Any way of actually figuring out the numbers and forcibly limit them is a boon to one's time.</div>

Your figures may show something entirely different.

Margaret's post has six in a one line example.<br><br>The key, I think, and Seraphim and others have mentioned this, is to find a way of batching and/or processing such Recurring tasks.  Wasn't it nuntym who several weeks ago brought in the concept of these tasks as being of a maintenance type and need to be processed in a certain way for efficiency's sake?<br><br>One problem is that consolidating such tasks under one or a few headings leads to the danger of some individual tasks not being done.  I've got a personality, and now a matching  ag,e that lends itself to forgetting things, which is one reason I've coped better since AF arrived nearly two years ago.<br><br>I combat this deficiency of my own with extensive checklists, especially for work travel where arriving at a foreign destination with something missing can be a right burden.  Not having a spare power unit for my notebook computer is not a problem in Durban or Damascus, but it is in Solwezi or Mkuu-Rombo.<br><br>I've been tackling these 'maintenance' recurring tasks by entering each relevant one into lists called:<br><br>- First thing morning: eg turn heating system on, check overnight email, schedule for the day,AF/DWM list, take garbage downstairs when leaving, medication.<br>- Work stuff: these are items to be packed into my work bag (backpack or briefcase) or to carry/have about my person.<br>- Mid-Morning: Check email (I turn off automatic sending/receiving to minimise distractions), reviewAF/DWM, make/return calls or messages.<br>- Break: as above plus a snack and soup.<br>- Afternoon: as above, plus check errands to do en route back to apartment (all errand items are written in a Moleskine pocket notebook which I always carry with me everywhere, and which serves a capture point if my AF/DWM book isn't with me).<br>- Arrival apartment: set up computer notebook on desk, review AF/DWM, reduce Inbox to zero, go through new entries in Moleskine pocket book, save new passwords, incremental backup etc.<br><br>I also have a Weekly and a Monthly Maintenance list with additional tasks to the daily stuff, such as a weekly full backup, review medication stock, monthly battery swap/recharge, clean IT kit etc.<br><br>These maintenance tasks are all in a ListPro file which is available on my smartphone (WM 6.5, no iPhone for me, yet).  I am able to tick off the applicable ones, then clear the tick boxes for the next day when I'm done.<br><br>And yes, sometimes I might forget to use the list, so I may still enter a forgotten task into my AF/DWM list.  Some days a task item might not be applicable, but it's still on the list if does need to be ticked, eg green box medication ok?<br><br>Works for me.</div>

<div class="meta">2010-12-4 12:24</div>
<div class="content">Roger:<br><br>Whether 32 Recurring Tasks is too many or not depends on your circumstances. I know I could cut down the number considerably in my life, but of course that may be quite different for other people.<br><br>I think checklists are a great idea, particularly in the sort of circumstances you mention. For years I was out giving presentations to church groups every night of the week, and I always used a check list to make sure I hadn't forgotten anything.<br><br>I note that the checklists you mention are for particular times, such as first thing in the morning, packing for work, and so on. I don't recommend that tasks which have to be done at a particular time should be on an Autofocus list. AF is for managing unscheduled tasks.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>Oops, I forgot to mention that the maintenance tasks referred to in my previous posting do not appear anywhere in my AF/DWM list.  They reside in Listpro and are triggered by an Outlook alarm at the appropriate time.  I use Outlook for hard schedule appointments and regular recurring tasks.<br><br>I just have to have these checklists because although I've tried to make them habits, sometimes I forget the basic stuff when I leave the apartment or office, eg passport (advisable to carry it here in Damascus, or at least a colour copy of the main page and current visa - note to self: scan passport, print copies, carry in wallet/work bag), even my watch or phone now and again.<br><br>Of course, little reminders not in Listpro DO appear on AF/DWM, eg "Put new camera in work bag before end of day".<br><br>BTW, you need to correct that 'Columns' error in the Lifehacker copy as well, just in case.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for clarifying your instructions, Mark -- it now makes perfect sense which page the initial list of 10-20 tasks should go onto.<br><br>I must admit, though, that I'm a bit nervous about one aspect of this new system: because there's no dismissal of unfinished tasks, I can see myself getting into the situation where I make some progress on a task, but the task then languishes on the unfinished list and I never make any further progress on it.<br><br>Since I always seem to have more to do than time available, wouldn't this new system result in working on the "new" page to avoid items being dismissed, and then working a bit on the easy/interesting/rewarding "unfinished" tasks, without ever getting to those more difficult, less interesting, or unrewarding tasks because there's always something else you could work on instead?  Since there's always going to be more to do than time available, wouldn't the unfinished task list keep growing (at least for tasks that can't be finished in one go) and eventually this list would get stale?<br><br>I'm also not convinced that I'd have such a large proportion of recurring tasks.  Looking at my current DWM2 list, I can see my tasks would be grouped like this:<br><br>New/Old: 31 tasks.<br>Unfinished: 7 tasks.<br>Recurring: 3 tasks.<br><br>In other words, the vast majority of the work I'm doing is various one-off projects (home, hobby or work related), some of which I've started, others are still waiting and I haven't made any progress on yet (and some of these will no doubt get dismissed).  But I only have 3 (out of a total of 41) tasks which could be considered to be recurring: replying to emails, folding washing, and tidying the kitchen.  Everything else on my list is a one-off task or project.<br><br>Maybe I'm mis-understanding what you mean by a recurring task -- or maybe my life is just different from your's...<br><br>One of the things that really appeals to me with your DWM system (and your simply brilliant DWM2 variation where everything is on a single list) is that every item is sitting on the "conveyor belt of doom" -- there's a limited amount of time in which to do an item, and if I don't make any progress on it in that time, the item gets dismissed.  End of story -- there's no finessing the system or possibility of cheating.  And things would definitely never languish on the list because there's no dismissal of unfinished tasks...<br><br>Or maybe I'm just mis-understanding how your new system works!  I really should try it, though I must confess that I'm a bit leery of doing so because DWM2 is working so incredibly well for me.  If it ain't broke...</div>

As you know it's a recurring task, you enter 'Incremental back-up' into the Recurring Tasks page/section.<br><br>4. Later you get around to doing another incremental back-up.  If you do cross it out in the Recurring Tasks page/section, does it get entered again at the bottom of the Recurring Tasks page/section?<br><br>If so, why bother?  Why not give it a pencil tick to feel good for having done it, then later on erase the pencil tick so that status of the task - in its original location in the Recurring Tasks page/section - reverts back to 'not yet done'?<br><br>Or is the answer that because one usually has so many recurring tasks (typical maintenance task types) that one still re-enters at the end of the list to demonstrate achievement and progress?<br><br>From the various recurring tasks mentioned in this thread, eg laundry, cleaning, garbage bin, incremental back-ups etc, maybe a more efficient way would be, in the case of weekly or monthly tasks, to enter the tasks into a master list, set a reminder when they should be done  (even if the tasks are done on different days during the week), then just tick them off in pencil until the last one is done.

Unfortunately, I don't think you've quite understood what I was getting at.  In response to your point (a), yes, stuff does get dismissed from the old list, but with this system the old and new items are both on a single page (or series of pages), and dismissal happens from that page.  That's what I meant by the "new" page -- sorry, I should have said "new/old" page.<br><br>More generally, though, I do see never getting to some tasks as a serious problem.  The thing is that items are constantly moving around on the lists -- new items get added, existing items get worked on, sometimes finished and sometimes re-entered.  With this constant flow of work, I can see it being very easy indeed for items on the "unfinished" list to just sit there and never get done.<br><br>For example, I have a number of unfinished projects which I'm working on "little and often":<br><br> * Tidying my office.<br> * Working through my paperwork backlog.<br> * Working through my email backlog.<br> * Typing up a bunch of notes from a workshop I attended a month ago.<br> * Reading a book.<br> * Removing nails from a stack of timber currently sitting in my garage.<br> * Building a new garden wall.<br><br>With Mark's new system, these would all end up on the "unfinished" page.  But at any one moment, that page would almost certainly include a number of high-priority tasks which need to get worked on as well -- for example, preparing for a meeting, or working towards a major work deadline.  When working on the "unfinished" page, these higher priority / more urgent tasks would generally end up trumping the lower priority and less urgent tasks such as those I listed above.  And since there's always going to be at least one task that's yelling out to be done, I can see many of the above tasks simply sitting there and never getting attended to.<br><br>That's what DWM does -- it applies an (admitted artificial) urgency to tasks that wouldn't otherwise stand out.  This forces you to face up and either work on a task to move it forward, or else to dismiss the task and admit that it isn't going to get done.  With DWM, I know that I'll be able to keep all these "little and often" projects moving forward, even though there's no inherent urgency in any of them.  With Mark's new version of AF4, I can't see that happening.<br><br>Or maybe I've mis-understood the way in which Mark's new system is supposed to work...</div>

<div class="content">Would there be a disadvantage in using the closed/open list paradigm in Unfinished and (possibly) Recurring as well?<br><br>I agree with some of the commenters above that tasks may tend to 'sit' in the Unfinished category while other more pressing or less procrastination-inducing tasks get added and completed.<br><br>But furthermore, knowing myself, there are definitely some recurring tasks that may benefit from the closed/open list system as well. For example, you'd be amazed how long I can put off cleaning my dishes. I hate doing dishes. Plain and simple. Granted, there will not really be a punishment for not doing a task in the closed section of the Recurring list, since those tasks really do recur, whether I dismiss them or not, but it'll add a sense of guilt if I cheat my way out of it and don't do anything in the closed list of my Recurring tasks.</div>

<div class="content">Sorry, but I'm still not sure how to treat real multi-step projects with a separate project plan. I actually see them as recurring tasks since I need to revisit them over and over again until the project is finished (I don't like to see them as unfinished). Well, I'm actually experimenting with a separate project page (thus having four types of pages: OLD/NEW, PROJECTS, RECURRING, UNFINISHED - in that order). The PROJECTS page is treated like the RECURRING page. What do you think?</div>

<div class="content">Alan and Jupiter - thanks for your responses!<br><br>I really like separating things I may do/haven't started yet from things that I have started and am committed to.  AF4R handles that well with NEW/OLD and UNFINISHED/RECURRING and allows you to see your volume in each context.<br><br>There is definitely a similarity here with Kanbans (backlog/do eventually, doing/what you are committed to completing now, and done).  My struggle is that I want to quickly and easily identify what I'm most committed to doing NOW.  However, that could be on any of the three AF4R lists.  <br><br>The holy grail of all this AF/DWM/DIT stuff may be finding a way to coordinate the backlog/now/done into a paper list (or lists) that doesn't require much rewriting but really highlights the NOW part.  You are constantly pulling from the backlog list, but focusing on a limited NOW.  Mark's 3 task trial aligns with that.</div>

<div class="content">Scott,<br><br>There is a similarity to Kanban for sure. Even the discussion here on task size is helping me manage the team kanban board better.<br><br>Now toward your holy Grail: One approach to Af4r is to deliberately start as few things as possible (in line with3t and kanban). Additionally make the items on the Unfinished list to be medium sized. (You might allow one big item to be your main focus.). So every time you visit the new and old lists, restrict yourself to Small items and very few bigger items. The result should be that the Unfinished list has those things you want to focus on. You finish those, enter next steps as new, and go get some more.<br><br>Above is how I operated My System, which is like AF4r without a recurring section.  I Found it worked quite well.</div>

<div class="content">Kanban is a Japanese word meaning signal. It's used in manufacturing where workers put out a card to a spot indicating that somebody downstream needs a part built. These cards might be arranged on a board to indicate an assembly line where a card in column x indicates step x needs to be applied to project x.  <br><br>As a way to reduce overhead, we aim to minimize the amount of cards flowing across the board. And as a mechanism to encouage this, each column has a fixed limit, such as no more than 3 at stage x. <br><br>For personal work, typical cards would be projects or tasks, columns could be Backlog, plan, do, finished, and a strict limit on the do column forces a person to finish unfinshed work.<br><br>Kanban also lets you define different groups with different limits. Erik's system defines 5 types of work, and it limits the amount of time spent each day on each.</div>

<div class="content">A Kanban depicts a flow through which a certain something goes through to get to a finished state. Each step gives it value of some sort. Three things that Kanban are really good at are:<br>- Visualizing the work in progress (and by a by-product seeing where things are bogging down)<br>- Limiting the Work in Progress<br>- It is a pull system compared to a push system where when things get out to the finished state, it creates an opening for a new something to take it's place. (Flow is dictated by what comes out of the system, not what comes into it).<br><br>Your new AF4R has to some extent, those three things, albeit I'll admit that it is not yet a pull system :)</div>

<div class="content">Imagine the following Personal Kanban setup<br>Here are column headings for two tables:<br><br>Backlog | Prepare | Work | Done<br><br>Maintainance | Work | Done<br><br>Backlog is like New/Old without a rule for dismissing.  It collects tasks as you think of them. <br>Now let's say you choose Clean Yard. Move that card to Prepare. <br>First step is to get the rake, bags, shears, warm clothes. <br>Once Prepare is done, move it to Work. This spot is like Unfinished. The task will stay there while you ignore it, work on it, or do something else. The work limits (like 3 in your 3 task system) urge you to get the Yard clean so you can work on something else. <br><br>In maintenance, we have recurring items.  you would pull an item out of M, work on it, and put it to done when finished. Once done, put it back to Maintenance for the next time.<br><br>In fact kanban has one way to encourage dismissal though it isn't often used this way: the column limits. If say you restrict your  backlog count to 20, then if you think of a 21st item, you need to dismiss something to make room.</div>

<div class="content">I do vaguely remember looking at the Kanban software demo someone flagged up some months ago and thinking that I couldn't see how it could possibly work for personal tasks (as opposed to progress on major projects).<br><br>I guess the 3T system would be Kanbanesque, in that one takes three tasks and isn't allowed to move on until two of them have been completed, but I can't see that dividing tasks into New, Old, Recurring and Unfinished is in the least bit Kanbanic.

<div class="content">Hoo boy! Questions. <br><br>The fundamental rule is this: you may work anything at any time provided there is room. The goal is to minimize work in progress which minimizes time to finish and maximizes throughput.  <br><br>As to deciding: Kanban is driven by sight more than by rules.  In a team setting you would choose on building screws because the assembler down the line needs screws to assemble something. On a board you would see he's needing screws. But if he's plenty busy you make bolts instead for someone else. <br><br>So if you have company coming that pulls vacuuming out. If nothing is urgent you choose whatever you feel like.<br><br>Multiple columns aim to standardize work and to divide work across people. In this case it is quite useless, just illustrates what a column might be. <br>You could have a cleanup column if you like though. <br><br>Track: a card on a spot means you need to work on it. There is no historical record of where cards were. It is common to date the cards when they were written or last worked on.</div>

GTD (context) Franklin Covey (priority of task/role), Total Workday Control (urgency - when to be done), etc.  The kanban discussion tends towards TWC.<br><br>Anyway...perhaps instead of separate lists for unfinished, recurring, new and old...What we could do is have them for tasks/projects that are:<br>- MAYBE (ideas that we haven't committed to acting on yet)<br>- PENDED (things we are going to do, but not yet:  Tickler items with future dates & Someday)<br>- ASAP or backlog (we are committed to doing them and will do so as soon as they feel ready to be acted upon)<br>- NOW (those limited items we've pulled from the the pages above to do NOW).

<div class="content">There is a slight difference between kanban and personal kanban.<br>But first I should point out that a kanban is what you want it to be; you try a sequence of steps with work in progress limits and tweak things as you see problems arise always striving to have the most streamlined process.<br><br>The kanban is perfect for teams. The personal kanban goes against that since you are an individual. And as Mark points it out, the are not many columns necessary (to do, doing, done). I personally have also the Checklist from which I take things and put them on the backlog to be processed. I soon figured out that adding columns was complicating things instead of simplifying them and life is not an assembly line. But I needed more power to choose what was important to me now. So I color coded different tasks with different activities. You could do it with areas of life if you prefer.<br><br>All is very visual so it's not that hard to decide on what you want to work next and you soon figure out where things get bogged down!</div>
