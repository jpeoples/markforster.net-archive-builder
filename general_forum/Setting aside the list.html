<div class="content">During this lent challenge, I've been using Simple Scanning.  Sometimes though I've set the list aside.  This is particularly true during the weekends when I'm with my toddler and wife.  I feel it important to not be buried in my paper notebook throughout the day around them, but just do some "low hanging fruit" tasks while I'm spending time around them.  For example, picking up, folding laundry, doing dishes, etc.  <br><br>I've been trying to answer the question, when is it okay to set aside the list.  I'd like to know others' thoughts on the following generalized rule I've drafted:<br><br>"Use the time management system of choice (for me, long list and simple scanning) unless your intuition says to set it the system aside for as long as you feel you need and no longer."  <br><br>I find that this rule is necessary for me to know when it is okay to not work from the list and still feel like I'm keeping the lent challenge.  I'd like to know everyone else's experience.</div>

<div class="content"><< "Use the time management system of choice (for me, long list and simple scanning) unless your intuition says to set it the system aside for as long as you feel you need and no longer." >><br><br>That seems to be well within the range of Mark's rule, "If something needs to be done now, just do it now!"<br><br>And it's basically what I do with Serial No-List as well. I wrote more about that here: <a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2736312#post2736439" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2736312#post2736439</a></div>
