<div class="content">One of the things I am really liking about AF is it gives me an opportunity to scribble down ideas for things to do on the list.  Of course, when I get to them on the list many of them turn out to be simply "would be nice" items  but for a variety of reasons are not realistic/practical etc and so are eliminated.  However the act of writing them down seems to promt the brain to mull them over while working on the rest of the list and when I get to the task on the list, and it looks like a go-er,  I can break it down into smaller tasks, eg research it , delegate it to someone, or start taking some small steps myself  towards achieving it.  Some grow into interesting projects and achievements and some are lost as non- starters.  Either way I feel that AF is allowing me to be more creative while still being productive on the nuts and bolts of my work.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for putting this process into words. I just did this a few minutes ago. I had an idea, I wrote it down in AF but then I got a little worried that perhaps I was taking on too much. But Mark says not to over edit what you put into AF because the system will do that and you've nicely described how the system does that. <br><br>I can without any guilt dismiss the idea to my "someday" list or I can develop it for a bit, always with the option of throwing it back to the someday list or maybe finding that it has wings and takes off. I've been looking around for a long time to find a way of developing the many ideas that pop into my head in a way that doesn't overwhelm or jeopardise my priority projects and I think this has a lot of potential to be that system. Thinking about it, I recently closed off my first few pages and I did dismiss 1 idea on it to a someday list and I did a little work on another idea so so far, it's working!</div>
