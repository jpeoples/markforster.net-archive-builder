<div class="content">Hello everyone!<br><br>I am a convert from GTD and I must say that Autofocus is a much easier and more intuitive system. Simplicity is best! :)<br><br>I am using the original Autofocus (AF1) but I remember that there used to be a summary of all the variations of Autofocus. It was under the heading of "Which Autofocus system is right for you" or something to that regard.<br><br>Is that still available? I searched for it, but I could not find it anywhere. I would like to see all the variations to be able to finetune my system.<br><br>Thanks in advance and keep the great discussions coming!<br><br>Jonathan</div>

<div class="content">+JMJ+<br><br>Welcome to Mark Forster's forums, Jonathan.<br><br>For now, the consensus by Mark and all the rest is that SuperFocus is the best AF version and thus the "Autofocus" link above has been replaced with "Superfocus Rules".  However, Mark's review of his systems can be found in the blog archives: <a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/category/review-of-systems" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/category/review-of-systems</a><br><br>God bless.</div>
