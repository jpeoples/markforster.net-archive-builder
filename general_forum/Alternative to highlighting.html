<div class="content">I carry my list(s) around in a Circa portfolio which has only one slot for a pen.  I really don't like the thought of having to use a highlighter in addition to my pen....any ideas on how to use my pen to differentiate dismissed items?  Perhaps just circle them so they stand out?</div>

<div class="content">Because I don't use a highlighter either, I draw a pentagram next to the dismissed item (pentagram =  five-pointed star drawn with five straight strokes).<br></div>

<div class="content">I indicate each item with an empty box in the left margin that I then fill in when I act on the item.  Dismissed items get a "D" written in the box.  I find highlighters very distracting and also don't want to have to keep one with me all the time.</div>

<div class="content">Another alternative would be to use a combined pen/highlighter like the ones listed here: <a href="http://wiki.autofocus.cc/Pens" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.autofocus.cc/Pens</a></div>

<div class="content">Gretchen, Rainier, Sarah: to each his own!<br><br>When I started using AF back in January, I too was worried about the distracting potential of highlighting.  But in fact, I find it works well for me, my eye is now able to seek out UN-hiighlighted items easily, despite the use of three colours:<br><br>Green: for completed, tackled (then re-entered at the end again) or items entered into Outlook with a reminder (task or time slot).<br>Yellow: for items entered but which are physically impossible to do at my current location.  I work mainly overseas, so some home office items cannot be done till i get home.  Tonight I leave Egypt after a month's assignment (hey, just thought, the Ancient Egyptiians used a lot of blue and yellow highlighters!), so will trawl through the yellow items that I have to do at my home office, marking them again in green when done/addressed.<br>Pink: for dismissed items, in case I ever want to revisit them.<br><br>As I say, my eye seeks out the unhighlighted items with ease.  When entering items, I do as many others do (and after trying electronic a couple of times), I put a short dash at the beginning, "target" items by putting a vertical line through the dash ie the dash becomes a cross, and strike through the entire line when done, then highlight.<br><br>So despite three colours, this works for me, which for any of us, is the important thing.  Boxes at the beginning wouldn't, tried that as well.<br><br>Champing at the bit for AF2, or 6!<br><br>Roger J<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hello <br>Highlining Items doesn(t wort for me at all. <br>I took sarah's checkbox system and it works perfectly with me. <br>Colors and context distract me and tends to make me un focus on situation.<br>So just writing items is suffisant for me.<br>However i still have some problem about dissmissing items. <br>I solve it crossing what could be crossed and reporting dissmiss items on a someday or a maybe list what is quiet nice because it make me focus on real active autofocus List. <br></div>

<div class="content">Credit where credit is due... I believe it was Mike who suggested the checkbox idea to me, sometime in mid-February.  :^D</div>

<div class="content">Great :)) I love the idea of check box <br>1) it doesnt change me a lot from omnifocus ;))<br>2) I found a good tip i like when i have to follow something i just check the box then i just have to read all what is check for everything to follow and i report too all waiting task on a special list like someday maybelist</div>

<div class="content">I just noticed AF2 is an improvement concerning this since you only dismiss once per day. So you can highlight your dismissed items in the morning and you don't need to carry the highlighter around with you. (Except if you also mark items as done by highlighting, of course.)</div>
