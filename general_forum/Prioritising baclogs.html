<div class="content">One of the nice things about DIT is that, since one gets a day's work done in a day, one doesn't need to prioritise.  It doesn't matter what order things are done as long as they are done.<br><br>But if one has a backlog, by definition it's going to take more than a day to shift.  Doesn't this suck one in to choosing what's urgent/important/all the not so nice things DIT seeks to defend us from?</div>

<div class="content">My view with my backlog is that often the tasks have been waiting for a long time to be completed so a bit longer isn't going to cause many problems.  <br><br>I am working through it as my current initiative at the moment and generally pick one that appeals to be on that morning.  I know it may not be the most urgent or most important task on the list, but I am making headway to clear the backlog.</div>

<div class="content">David:<br><br>Yes, it does. Which is why one should never regard having a backlog as the "norm". Apart from the initial backlog when you start the DIT system for the first time, backlogs should be regarded with horror. Sometimes they are the best choice out of two evils, but they are almost always a symptom that something is wrong.</div>
