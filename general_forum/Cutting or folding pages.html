<div class="content">A simple approach to a detached C2 in a paper based system that keeps C2 'in your face' is to do one or both of the following:<br><br>1) Cut several pages (say 5-10) in half (or for more main working space, cut 40 off) vertically. This is your c1, and then keep 2 or 3 pages after as full pages of which only the right column c2 will be visible at all times. Now you have a detached c2. Can repeat this sequence for rest of notebook.<br><br>2) Fold instead of cutting as above. (This works, but in testing, cutting works better)<br><br>and for maintenance, whenever need to dismiss or move past a c2, then just fold it over.<br><br>Can vary the number of pages set for c1 and c2 every batch of pages to have enough to move through.<br><br>Just another thought of how to use standard paper based notebook form with another dimension.<br>July 6, 2011 at 17:57 | DarrenM</div>

<div class="content">Darren posted the above in the "what's wrong in SF" thread. I just tried it today on my SF-inspired system and whoosh!  This approach to any edition of AF, in a two column notebook is the bomb!  The whole thing seems more comfortable!<br><br>My details: System rules are same as before.  I'm just detailing the layout. AF1 can do exactly the same layout.  Starting at the back (I'm a lefty), going forward, I write only on the left-hand page. C1of the latest page is on the inside; C2 is the outside of the latest page. When that page closes and I start a new one, I fold the newly closed page in half, writing out.  I continue page by page scanning. Tear out a page when both sides are done, lest the book get too fat. <br><br>Effect: C2 is always visible on the left unfolded page. It's C1is easily accessed by grabbing all pages and lifting. Besides C2, an old C2 and old C1 are also visible.  Turning folded pages is easier than unfolded. <br><br>Notes:<br> SF users will want C1 visible as C2 is active on the folded page. <br>Right handed people will want to start at front.</div>

<div class="content">This partial-page idea intrigued me, but whenever I imagine the realities of cutting or folding, I feel like it would be easier to just run a second notebook for C2.<br><br>I had toyed with a "cascading notebook" idea, in which tasks might "bubble" up or down from the main notebook: "up" to an "Active" C2-ish notebook, vs. "down" to a long-term backlog notebook. The backlog would not sit out all the time, just grabbed when pruning older entries.<br><br>The two main notebooks would sit side by side on the desk, flipped to show one page each. Since I use half-size notebooks, I imagine this working nicely, but people with full-size notebooks might not like it. Unless they have big executive desks.<br><br>If my stalagmite/stalactite method runs out of steam, I'll be looking at this again.</div>

<div class="content">I tried two books. Didn't like it. This folding is actually just easy if you already work one side two columns like I did.</div>
