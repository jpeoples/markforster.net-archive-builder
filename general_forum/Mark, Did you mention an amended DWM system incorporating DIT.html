<div class="content">Mark, Is my memory failing me, or did you say that you were developing a new system of DWM which incorporated some elements of DIT?  I find that on days where I have to achieve certain items within a certain time, I write a Will Do List on the Month page, and work through that, choosing what stands out, before carrying on with DWM as normal.</div>
