<div class="content">After slightly more than 24 hours of using AF2, I consider myself one of the world's foremost experts on this revolutionary system. ;)<br><br>1. I find it to be an extraordinarily nimble system. Example: I have "NY Times" as the current item. I am reading the NY Times. Then I think of something else. I write it at the end of my list. I decide it's important to do now. So, I re-add "NY Times" and do this important-now item. Then I go back to reading the Times. Then I help my wife deal with our mouse problem (after writing that on my list, followed by "NY Times" again). Then I go back to the Times. In AF1, this kind of quick reaction was usually not possible, unless, serendipitously, I was on the last page and there were a lot of blank lines left on the last page. So far, I have found this nimbleness to be a very positive attribute, rather than a distraction.<br><br>Mark has written about being "on list" 24 hour-a-day. I don't have any near-term plans to try this myself, but it is very significant that one could even consider this. That is a sign of the sensitivity of AF2 compared to AF1. I never even would have toyed with the 24-hour idea with AF1.<br><br>2. I will now put forward the idea that AF2 still incorporates the idea of a closed list. Admittedly, the definition of closed might need to be reinterpreted slightly, but I do not think it damages the core concept. I have designated as the "chopping block" the items that Mark calls "on notice for dismissal." My chopping block is my closed list. I can't add to that list. I can only do or dismiss the items on that list. That really focuses my attention. I find this aspect much more DIT-like than AF1-like and I like it. With DIT and the chopping block, I tend to have a smaller number of items. And I know that they are high priorities for today. With AF1, it was rarely a case that there were items that were marked "do or die" for any particular day.</div>

<div class="content">This sounds great and I'll definitely try it. But it also seems slightly obsessive to be writing everything down just before you do it.  But I'll still try it.</div>

<div class="content">I like the forced break between stimulus and reaction that you get with AF1.  Just writing it down doesn't give me quite enough distance.  This is another reason why I'm hesitant to jump into AF2.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim, I'm having the same concerns but I'm giving it a go for a couple of days at least to see if it will sort itself out in a satisfactory manner.  I'm very prone to the "ooh shiny!" effect and the "structured procrastination" of AF1 helped a LOT with that.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br>Well, there generally is a forced break between stimulus and reaction because it's only rarely that you think of something at the same moment that you are going to do it. So I am dealing with the task "Comments" at the moment. When I have finished it I will re-enter it, but I can't start it again because there will be no further comments to deal with at that stage. So I will move further back up the list and possibly the item "Email" will stand out for me, which will be eight tasks back (assuming I haven't added any more tasks in the meantime). <br><br>Having completed "Email" I will re-enter that, but there will probably now be several things between "Email" and "Comments." So if I'm going to go back to comments I will have to ignore several other tasks.<br><br>So I'm not "writing everything down just before I do it" as Steve put it. There's a definite break between stimulus and reaction.</div>

<div class="content"><<There's a definite break between stimulus and reaction. >><br>This is what I like so much about AF2. <br><br>It is fluid and nimble without being reactive. It hits the sweet spot. I am filling up the pages a lot more quickly with AF2 than I could with AF1, because AF2 can handle so much more.<br><br>There is only the momentary act of writing it down before I go right back to work. Personally, I would not even consider doing AF2 electronically. I don't want to boot up. AF2 is like the notes I take during a phone conversation. I have to do them on paper. [I still have my electronic calendar and electronic project-planning application.]<br><br>I really do want to change my notebook now. I spend a lot more time flipping through pages now. My existing AF notebook has a spiral wire on the top. My ideal notebook would have pages that are long but not wide, lots of lines, and a spiral wire that is vertical.</div>

<div class="content">moises:<br>>>>My ideal notebook would have pages that are long but not wide, lots of lines, and a spiral wire that is vertical.<<<<br>I agree,  my solution was to cut down a margin free A4 notebook from a width of 21 to 14 cm as mostly the whole page width is not used.</div>

<div class="content">Mark -- Your answers all make good sense.  And a lot of people really seem to like AF2.  But I am still finding myself hesitating.  <br><br>So, I'll also add "Try pure AF2" to my AF1 list, and see if it stands out.  :-)<br><br>Meanwhile, I am trying the dual-mode approach (normally following AF1, switch to AF2 when urgency strikes, dismiss following AF1 rules) -- will let you know how that goes.</div>

<div class="content">You could try treating your AF2 dismissed items as an AF1 list, following AF1 rules.<br><br>So there would be an AF2 section at the end of the list for day-to-day, and and AF1 section above that for longer term.<br><br>If an AF1 item is worked on it would then be added to the bottom of the list in the AF2 section.</div>

<div class="content">Smiley,<br><br>Ooooooo, now that is an intriguing idea!!!!<br><br>- No problem with dismissing by the AF2 rule because it goes right to the old AF1 list to be worked on and is not out of sight.<br><br>- It goes right back into the AF2 list once worked on in the AF1 list, and is now at the bottom where it will get to be seen and processed further.<br><br>- The system won't "thrash" as you only go to AF1 upon dismissal from AF2.<br><br>- It kind of addresses Mark's concern about a "rule" to tell you when to switch modes.  (Though I guess, technically, you still need a rule to tell you when to stop looking at the AF2 list and go work on the AF1 list.)<br><br>It is kind of like having a "someday/maybe" list for dismissed items but on in which you are prompted to continue working on them.<br><br>I need to chew on this more to decide if it messes up anything else.<br><br>Great idea, though.  ;-)</div>

<div class="content">As we know from AF1, it takes a couple of weeks for our lists to reach something like maturity. Until then, any comment can only be provisional. <br><br>Provisionally, then, I agree that the key word here is "nimble". And I can see myself staying on list much more easily.<br><br>the list feels much more fluid and immediate. In the past I would have had separate task breakdowns , but now they're on the main list for immediate action. <br><br>For example, to fix a support portal on the fly yesterday I needed to move a number of files, separately, onto my PC and then onto a server, then make them available then set up a view of the directory then create a link to the view. <br><br>In AF2: <br>when the problem arose I noted "move session materials to user site" and <br>when I got back to that task I broke it out into <br>- a table (7 lines, 2 columns) of file downloads and uploads<br>- Session materials checked in<br>- Set up view by session<br>- edit link -> new session materials<br><br>I treated the table as a single entry, but otherwise followed standard AF2, adding new tasks/ ideas as they came to me and skimming back through them to make sure I wasn't missing anything critical between tasks.<br><br>Worked a treat. And preserved on my list for posterity rather than lost in a pile of paper or OneNote file somewhere.<br><br>We'll see how the central bulge develops over the next few days.</div>

<div class="content">When I read the AF2 description, my mind was screaming "NOOOOO...."  But turns out that my mind didn't know how much it was gonna like this.  Using AF2 feels fluid & nimble.  Love it!<br><br>And surprisingly, I've been choosing to do several rather routine boring tasks (like bringing Quicken up to date), and I've been feeling quite good about doing them.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">And as for the idea of a closed list, each pass from latest to oldest is of course on a closed list.</div>

<div class="content">Will,<br><br>I think the definition of a closed list is a list to which we cannot add new items (DIT pages 28, 146). <br><br>By this definition, each pass from the latest to the oldest is an open list, because we can add to it as we work it.<br><br>But the "on notice" dismissal list is closed block with one or more items. We cannot add to it. <br><br>In AF1 each page (except the last) was a closed list. I had to do at least one item or dismiss the page. I couldn't add items to the page because it was already full.</div>

<div class="content">Moises,<br><br>that was what I thought. But I have changed my mind.<br><br>You cannot add a new task before your starting point. Admittedly, you only pick one item before the next pass, so you cannot reasonably hope to finish it, but your choice is limited to a closed list. Next pass you have a different closed list including anything you added while doing the first pass.<br><br>With AF1, on one pass of the list you are working on an open list of closed lists (!).<br><br>Although it feels a bit like angelic pinhead-dancing territory, this does seem to make a real difference to how often I see the beginning of the list. under AF1, I could be struggling to catch up with the end of the list for days at a time.</div>
