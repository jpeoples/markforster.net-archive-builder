<div class="content">Hello everyone,<br><br>if Mark gives me permission, I will make the next version of autofocus.cc open source. This will allow anyone to install it on his own server or personal computer if they don't want to have their data sitting on a system they're not in control of. It will also make it easier for other developers to contribute.<br><br>I'm using the version control management git for development. The source code will be available here: <a href="http://github.com/andreashofmann/autofocus.cc/tree/master" rel="nofollow">http://github.com/andreashofmann/autofocus.cc/tree/master</a><br><br>I'll push the code there as soon as a) the new version is published b) Mark says he's okay with it.<br><br>I'm not sure which license I should use - Creative Commons, BSD-style or GPL. A CC license would be fitting the name AF.cc, but perhaps there are better criteria. ^^</div>

<div class="content">No problem from my point of view, Andreas. Thanks for all the hard work you have so generously put into this.</div>

<div class="content">Andreas:<br>Thanks for you work!<br>I have no programming background, so please allow the question if this makes it possible to run your app form an USB Stick also?<br></div>

<div class="content">Jens:<br><br>Well, it isn't a classic application but a web application, so you need a web server to run it. That being said, it is possible to use a portable web server (for example XAMPP or Server2Go) with AF.cc from an USB stick.</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br>Thank you very much! Now I just have to finish that version and make the code presentable. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Okay, change of plans. It has become clear that I built up too much resistance towards cleaning up that old mess of code, so I'll start from scratch and publish everything immediately into github. So if I ever give up, someone else can take over immediately. Of course, you don't have to wait that long if you want to help. ;-)<br><br>I can't commit to this full time, but I plan to put in one or two hours a day. Target for today is to setup the framework and have a working basic "hello world". No stress.</div>

<div class="content">I pushed "hello world" to github. Don't bother checking it out unless you're interested in the development itself.</div>

<div class="content">I put a draft of the new layout here: <a href="http://autofocus.cc/public/data/layout/draft.html" rel="nofollow">http://autofocus.cc/public/data/layout/draft.html</a><br><br>As you can see, I adopted the "focus on single task" approach I played around with in this thread: <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/776433" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/776433</a><br><br>This means you'll strictly follow the af.cc workflow automatically. The mobile interface will always show the current task, the desktop version show more additional information. I kept some things from the last draft at <a href="http://autofocus.cc/public/data/layout/draft.html" rel="nofollow">http://autofocus.cc/public/data/layout/draft.html</a> <br><br>Note that the info boxes for due and on notice tasks show how far you are away from them. I hope this will provide more incentive to move through the list to reach those tasks.<br><br>Since everyone has a different monitor size and resolution, I plan to let users choose how many columns they want an which boxes go into which columns.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Andreas,<br><br>Looks great!<br>There's a lot of info on the page without it being cluttered or too busy, and the colour scheme is easy on the eyes.<br><br>I also like the added focus on the single task that is to be considered.</div>

<div class="content">Andreas, thank you for the great tool !<br><br>I'm using it on PC, Mac and iPhone together and I'm absolutely happy !<br><br>Regarding new designs you showed recently - could we please have the current version preserved and new designs build in parallel? These new designs seem too much cluttered to me, not intuitive and streamlined as the current version is ! Plus on iPhone they might load longer and take more (paid) traffic due to the complexety of their design.<br><br>It is personal opinion, I know, but could you please preserve the current version for current users and put new designs into new URLs? Thanks!</div>

<div class="content">George,<br><br>well, I'm currently concentrating on completing AutofocusAHK, so it will still be some time before the new AutofocusCC rolls out. And even if it does, I have no intention of killing the old version. I want the newest version at <a href="http://autofocus.cc" rel="nofollow">http://autofocus.cc</a> though, so when the time comes, it will be the old version that will change it's url, to classic.autofocus.cc or something. You'll have to update your bookmark once and then continue to use it.<br><br>Also note that the design shown above is not intended for iPhone, the iPhone will have it's own interface. The "big" version just allows to use the bigger screen real estate with additional information. But this is optional. You can still use it with just one column.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Andreas,<br>I've just tried AutofocusAHK and Autofocus.cc.<br>I think I'll be using Autofocus.cc for my AF for now, due to the web based application being much easier to be simultaneously used on both my WM6 pdaphone and my WinXP main machine.<br>I'm using Autofocus.cc with Iris browser on my WM6 devices since it displays the page much better than IEMobile6. ;-)<br>Thanks for the great application.</div>

<div class="content">My usual workflow looks like this:<br><br>- Create webpage following standards<br>- Check page in Firefox, Opera, Chrome, Safari - usually works<br>- Check page in IE8 - much better standards support than previous versions, mostly okay<br>- Check page in IE7<br>- Fix IE7 bugs<br>- Check page in IE6<br>- Fix IE6 bugs<br>- Check page in IE5.5<br>- Fix IE5.5 bugs<br>- Check page in IE5<br>- Fix IE5 bugs<br><br>Though I recently started to ignore IEs older than 6. I just wish IE6 would finally dissappear, too. It's a shame so many people refuse to upgrade. Of course the other browsers are by no means perfect and have problems too, but compared to IE they're like heaven.</div>

<div class="content">Andreas,<br><br>After using AFCC (Autofocus.cc) for a day, I'm requesting a feature. :-/<br><br>I would really appreciate an additional export format other than the current "Plain Text Export". Specifically export in AFAHK (AutofocusAHK) Tasks.txt format. And a corresponding import feature too. <br><br>That would allow migrating AF lists between AFCC and AFAHK. Or may be even working with either, depending on internet access. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Regarding the license. I prefer the GPL because it ensures that the software I make, and derivates made thereof, will remain free for all times. It makes it impossible to take the source code and release a new product from it to the public without making the source code public as well. It protects the user's freedom rather than the developer's. Many say that BSD-style licenses ate "more free", but it is a philosophical question in my opinion, it depends on what you mean with "free", for example whether to see to the freedoms of the developer who wants my source code, or the user. My vote goes to the user so I use the GPL. For web apps, there is a quite new license called the AGPL (based on the GPL), which might be worth looking up.<br><br>Thanks for a great webapp!</div>

<div class="content">After one week using AFCC for AF4 even though it's meant for AF1, and started to have dismissals, I really found I'm struggling with AFCC. Hence, I tried to find another webapps to implement AF4, settled on Google Docs spreadsheets, less automation, but not too bad. ;-)</div>
