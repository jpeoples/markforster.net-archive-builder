<div class="content">Just for fun, as it's Christmas how about we nominate some of the best ideas that have been posted here (blog or forum) since it began?<br><br>For me the most precious would be <a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2011/1/29/how-to-make-your-dreams-come-true.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2011/1/29/how-to-make-your-dreams-come-true.html</a> as everyone can use it to uplift their lives and it's just beautiful that anyone passing by this site can download it and have the opportunity to make positive changes or approach old problems in new ways.<br><br>I suppose the Superfocus rules get in as essential: <a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2011/2/10/rules-for-superfocus.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2011/2/10/rules-for-superfocus.html</a><br><br>I'd also suggest <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/726414" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/726414</a> by Sarah as an excellent example of how "standing out" can work.</div>

<div class="content">I really loved the 'Muddy Field' piece that Mark wrote, it completely changed my way of thinking about backlogs:<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/muddy-field" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/muddy-field</a><br><br>and just about anything on the basics of Autofocus (original flavour).<br><br>acedia xx</div>

<div class="content">I reread the Muddy Field.  Perhaps the most important article on this site.  I have drawn a line.  The question now is how to apply the "Clear incoming material daily" to AutoFocus?  AF rules, excepting DWM, don't have timed clearing, and eventually that becomes a problem.  <br><br>I think what happens is everything works smoothly, and then occasional busy periods cause the list to gradually go larger.  Unchecked, eventually it becomes overwhelming, and like walking through a muddy field.<br><br>So what is the AF analogue of "Clear Incoming Material Daily", given you don't clear your AF list daily?</div>

That tweak saved my bacon (and sanity) many times while I was using AF4.<br><br>But "Clear Incoming Material Daily"?  Hmm.  Maybe you can use AF4 and dismiss the closed list every end of the day.  But the thought of dismissing that much every day makes me cringe...</div>

<div class="content">That's exactly my point.  The recommendation for backlogs is to clear things daily, but that is certainly not the recommendation for AF systems.  It seems to me something different needs to be said about backlogs in AF.</div>

<div class="content">I'd like to thank Mark Forster and all forum participants for an invaluable year of self improvement.<br><br>My 2011 started out with a resolution to "really finally do GTD right," which promptly led to another binge of system/tool research and then to my arrival at this web site. Mark's unique ideas, his authenticity in his writing, and the insights and goodwill of forum contributors have led me to a state of ... hmm ... Unexpected Effectiveness.<br><br>See, I had thought success would come from whipping myself along a linear, self-disciplined grind of devouring hyper-organized lists, only because that describes every approach I'd encountered or imagined before markforster.net. In fact, GTD had actually seemed free-wheeling and intuitive compared to the rest of the field. But now that I have an AutoFocus notebook and a Dreams journal, I am effective in a much better and completely unexpected way.<br><br>Perfection still escapes me. Even an 80/20 level of imperfection escapes me. I feel like I am running at 40% of capacity, and I still lag far behind my mega-focused, completely unstructured era of Silicon Valley all-nighters and single-project sprints. But those days are over, and within my current stage of life, I am now more effective than ever. More importantly, I no longer wonder how I will ever manage to pursue my important goals, and I no longer trudge through my work as if strapped to a backpack loaded down with unheeded time management tomes! Whether or not I ultimately switch tools/systems again, 2011 marks an important milestone: the transition from putting my real aspirations on hold to pursuing them little & often amid everything else that calls for my attention.<br><br>So you might say my mission to "really finally do GTD right" has succeeded—by replacing it with AutoFocus and Dreams!<br><br>Many thanks and a happy holiday season to you all.<br><br>---------<br><br>Bernie's Top Three Posts of all time:<br><br>1.
