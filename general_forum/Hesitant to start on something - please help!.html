<div class="content">Oh dear. March 1st is fast approaching which is my 30 days out mark for the first time. I don't have anything that's going to "fall off" until March 5. That's not what worries me. <br><br>What I'm running into is being hesitant to work on things after March 5, because then if they are not complete, I'll have to put them on the "7 days out" page -- and then they will fall off sooner than if I'd just left them alone and not done anything with them!<br><br>The only solution I can think of is allowing an item to be considered done and break down the project into smaller steps so the next step can be written at the 30 days out page.<br><br>Any other ideas?</div>

<div class="content">I've had a couple items that I just let expire, then the next day (or 2) when I remember it again I just re-add it at +30. Probably not what Mark had in mind, but it does follow the rules to the letter, if not the spirit.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Alison,<br><br>It's a good idea to break projects into smaller tasks whether or not you keep the sub-tasks within DWM or in another file/system, eg Projects.<br><br>Project and major tasks do represent a challenge for most of us.  I use Listpro so I can keep projects and subordinate tasks together and expand/collapse the project at will.<br><br>I have a couple on the go, one domestic and one work.  I want one of them completed around 25 March. but I keep the main tasks in the daily closed list.  However, the sub-tasks have been entered at + 28 days from the date I entered them. <br><br>I suppose the correct thing to do would be to make the parent project with the same date as the last one among the sub-tasks, currently 19 March.<br><br>Whatever you do, do what works for you, but I can testify that this grand group of devotees in the forum may pull you up for "transgressions" or question your logic. but that kind of peer quality control is one of the things that has made AF and DWM the success it has been so far, along with Mark's vision.</div>

<div class="content">I've been incorporating the pomodoro method with good success. I set a timer for 25 minutes and start. When the timer rings, the task gets reset for 7 days later. I either decide to keep working on it or move to another task.<br><br>Keeping the idea in the back of my head that all I have to do is 25 minutes every 7 days on "evil task/project X" makes me feel more ready to do the evil task. <br><br>Of course I usually end up doing more than 25 minutes a week on said task, but please don't tell me that. :)</div>

<div class="content">When I have a "new" task that is actually a spin-off of an existing task, or it's part of an existing project, I enter them on the Today+7 page, not the Today+1M page.  I think Mark recommended this approach somewhere.</div>

I was considering abandoning DWM and returning to AF4, but I shall carry on with my new-found friends and keep giving it a go!

<div class="content">It's very interesting.  Mark's systems are designed to have minimal rules: as simple as possible.  This is a very good thing because it makes them work extremely smoothly once you get the hang of it.   <br><br>However, the rules are generally missing necessary background commentary.  People get confused if they don't have a grasp on some meta concepts, such as:<br>* when is it a good idea to work on something?<br>* when is it better to move on?<br>* how long should I work on a thing?<br>* why are we writing things on today+30 and today+7?<br>* how do I stay on top of my urgent items?<br><br>There's more.  The above questions are not answerable by rules.  But understanding them is key to understanding how and why the system works, and in some cases making the system work in practice.<br><br>I only need DWM's 4 rules to operate the system.  But the system relies on my intution to make decisions.  And my intuition works better if I understand the principles (answers to the above) behind the system.  Which is to say, if DWM becomes an addition to the DIT book, the rules fit on page 1, but DWM deserves a full chapter to explain the rules.</div>

<div class="content">Alan,<br><br>You win five gold starts for that post.  I really do think that is what a lot of people don't stop to consider about systems.  There is a lot going on behind the simple rules.<br><br>In a way, the Alan Lakein system was better for me in that I had to FIRST:<br><br>- Understand my values<br>- Develop a hierarchy of Long -> Short term goals<br>- Consider my obligations for the upcoming week<br>- Select the most important tasks which would lead to my most important goals<br>- Rank and prioritize them with respect to the goals<br>- List them in priority order (or with priority tags)<br><br>And only after all of that was I ready to "get started".  Of course, at that point it looks like a "simple to do list" ... but then so does AF.  The thing about AF (and now DMW) is that because of the way Mark sees things (the way he operates from his own personal internal processes) all of the decision making is masked by what  Mark calls "intuition".  But "intuition" is only as good as the thinking you have previously put in on the problem.<br><br>So I agree, that to make the system work very well, a lot of words will be needed to help people understand the effect of entering tasks a month out, working little and often ... all of the usual AF/DMW ideas that we all have come to know and love ;-)<br><br>I notice, as you perhaps have, that DMW has confused people more than the previous four AF's have.  I put it down to the one idea about "Date Entered is not Date Due".  That seems to really bring some to a screeching halt ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Veg,<br><br>And notice that some here who really do understand that, in their mind, STILL want to put the more important things "closer to the front".  If the system is to work as intended, the most RECENT entries MUST be at the end.  Doing that works.  Moving things up font will cause you to have to think about the way the list works in two antagonistic ways.  That way lies madness and the grave ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Ok, now it gets more interesting, or confusing<br><br>If the four rules are (forgive me not for taking them as read, I'm a simple bloke) . . . .<br><br>1. All new tasks are entered on the page which is one calendar month from today’s date (I use 28). <br>2. All re-entered tasks are entered on the page which is one week from today. <br>3. All active pages are treated as if they were one long list and you continue to circulate round them doing the tasks that stand out.<br>4. All tasks which are on pages earlier than today’s date have expired.<br><br> . . . . then is there not going to be an infinite number of what-ifs? that make up the 'background commentary' (Alan B) and that a 'lot of words' (Mike) will indeed be needed to explain DWM a bit more?<br><br>I think rationaliising (if thats; the appropriate term) in a book's chapter is going to be one hell of a task, but then Mark F and others are much better equipped than moi.<br><br>vhj: if date entered = expiration date, is a real due/deadline date before or after the expiration date?   If before, then expiration will only happen if the due date is missed or overlooked, and if after, then there is a danger that a task becomes written off before the task is due and before it gets done?<br><br>I'm not as good as some at explaining my perceptions, but it seems one does have to have that reminder (eg in Outlook) or annotate the date.  If the latter, then one (me?) can let things drift until the fear factor for the deadline date looms big.</div>

<div class="content">Roger,<br><br>I think what Alan and I are saying is that there are things which govern our action plan which are outside of the rules of the steps of the process.  For just the most obvious example: How large should the granularity of your tasks be?  That question lies outside the rules of the DWM system itself.</div>

<div class="meta">2010-02-23 1:08</div>
<div class="content">Roger,<br><br>Tasks that have a due date need it to be listed with the task. <br><br>By limiting where you write tasks (+30) or rewrite tasks (+7) to only 2 places on the list (note that I am say places, not dates) it helps your mind know where things are that you have written.  Those 2 pages are supposed to have placemarks which also helps you know where things are that you wrote recently.<br><br>Just because we are writing on dated pages doesn't mean we are using a calendar (or planner or schedule).  It is still just our list of tasks that is maintained separate from our calendar just like our AF lists were.  The pages just happen to have expiration dates on them.</div>
<h2>Reply by Alan Baljeu</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-02-23 1:19</div>
<div class="content">I've come to agree with Roger's opinion that deadlines on the calendar are important.  <br><br>My solution is to write appointments and due-bys on the top of the page.  I don't work on these.  They just sit there until the date arrives.<br><br>If there's some prep for these guys I will put tasks in as per the rules, and these appointments are nothing more than reminders to be sure to look up these tasks.</div>

<div class="content">As usual, excellent feedback for consideration.<br><br>I have to admit that I have never tried DWM in total manual mode, only in ListPro.  But it is still, as MartyH illustrates, separate from a calendar, hence my earlier post about using Outlook for reminder because Outlook is my calendar.<br><br>MartyH: thanks for reminding me that it "is still just a list of our tasks."  This is what my ListPro report is, and maybe the 'connection' with AF is why I am so comfortable with DWM in its present incarnation in ListPro, but enhanced by DWM's forward focus.<br><br>I'll try annotating the due date tasks (I said earlier I was not in favour of this, but what's the point of a mind if you can't change it sometimes?) and see how it goes.</div>

<div class="content">Roger J, you asked if a real due/deadline date is after expiration date, is there a danger that a task becomes written off before the task is due and before it gets done.   Of course there is that danger: if the task is due 2 months from now, and is entered at the +1-month date and so expires in one month, you might be tempted not to take action too soon, because the rules of re-entry at +7 would mean if you didn't take more action in the next 7 days it would expire, and you might prefer to wait and not take any action till just before the expiry date and then re-enter it at the +7 days, which would still be well before the actual deadline.<br><br> However,  that danger can work to your advantage: if you work on a task "little and often" (or "large and often"),  and keep re-entering it at the +7 expiry date, you're well ahead of the game, instead of running at the last minute to meet a deadline.</div>

<div class="content">Roger J:<br><br>You might be overlooking the benefits of the tickler/43 folders and the project page to complement DWM.  Here's what I do.<br><br>If I have a task with a due date more than a month in the future I do one of two things depending on how much thinking/work is required or how intensive it is:<br>1. Simple - put a reminder to put it on my list in my tickler/43 folder system so that it comes out one month ahead of its due date.  That way I don't run the risk of a task expiring on DWM before its due date.<br>2. Intensive - break it down so that the interim steps get done without putting the final deliverable in danger of early expiry<br><br>Here's a worked example for a simple task:<br>Today is 23rd Februrary<br>New task: deliver report by 23rd April    (If I put it onto my list now it gets entered on 23rd March which means that it might expire before it is due.  As I know this is a simple report which will only take me an hour or so e.g. just a matter of filling in a simple one page form.  I can stick to a single task entry.)<br>Put note in tickler: Enter 'deliver report (23rd Apr)' on list, file in 23rd March folder<br>Time passes...<br>Today is 23rd March<br>Get everything out of 23rd March tickler folder, see note and<br>Put task on list: 'deliver report (23rd Apr', entered one month out on 23rd April<br><br>Here's a worked example for a more intensive task:<br>Today is 23rd Februrary<br>New task: deliver report by 23rd April    (I already know that this is going to need several 'hits' e.g. outline, three or four drafts, peer review, final edit so I break it down in this way.  I have a project with seven interim steps/deliverables and eight weeks before the final due date.  I'll give each a week which will leave one week contingency at the end.)<br>Create project: I write the interim steps on a new project page with all the due dates and give the project a name 'Report A'<br>Put task on list: 'Work on Report A (2nd March)', entered one month out on 23rd March<br>Today is 27th February<br>Complete 'Work on Report A (2nd March)' and cross it out<br>Check project page for next due date<br>Put task on list: 'Work on Report A (9th March)', entered one month out on 27th March<br>and so on...<br><br>There's a good chance I'll complete the interim steps ahead of time.  If I leave each step until its due date I'll get it all done on time.  If I ignore a step until it approaches expiry I know I'll feel a lot of pressure so I've given myself the best chance of getting it done.<br><br>Hope this helps.</div>

<div class="content">Margaret1:<br><br>>you might prefer to wait and not take any action till just before the expiry date and then re-enter it at the +7 days, which would still be well before the actual deadline.<<br><br>I'm trying to avoid that as it seems an easy way to slip into old procrastination ways, so I like your next paragraph reminder about little and often etc as that means there will be some progress.  In scanning the list, I need to spot the items with true [DEADLINE DATE] and/or are IMPORTANT to/for me,  and let the nice-t-haves and other dross expire.<br><br>I'm finding this more feasible with DWM and getting a better focus and concentration, assisted by the reminders and tweaks in this forum.<br><br>SimonW: thanks, I'm doing this and attaching the target date for each sub-task in ListPro or using the + 28 days rule if possible, then tackling each in turn, maybe little and often if it's a big project like you describe.</div>

<div class="content">I used to put anything new on at +month and only enter stuff at +week as a result of a piece of work on the taks list. As I get used to the system, I find myself putting more and more tasks at +week rather than +month. Anything from a continuing mail conversation or relating to an existing project will go at +week unless I really could ignore it without affecting dellivery of the commitment..<br><br>Is anyone else finding this?</div>

<div class="content">Will,<br><br>At least your post is easier to comment on than the one above it.<br><br>Are you saying the majority of your NEW tasks are now going on + 7 days?<br><br>Then maybe that's your way of handling all the due date stuff descending on you, OR, these are re-entered tasks which means you're doing DWM correctly.<br><br>But others have pointed out that DWM rules say ALL NEW tasks must go + 28 or 30 days, then you work the list.  As mentioned somewhere else, I think one needs some Due Date tag as well.<br><br>Again , I think these latest post are showing the advantages of an electronic system, and I say this after oscillating between electronic and papyrus over the last year. and why I am currently staying electronic with ListPro for now.</div>

<div class="content">I guess what Will is referring to has to do with how you define "re-entry".  If I have a task "Call John about project X" on my list, and I find out that John can't answer my question but I have to ask Dick about it, is that a new task or a re-entry?  I'm still struggling with that: sometimes I'll enter it as a new task (that is, at the +month page), at other times (especially when I feel my work load is okay), I'll enter it as a re-entered task at the +week page.</div>

<div class="content">In these epic threads where people discuss the minutia of what they do in response to a general problem specific to someone else, I always have one question for the original poster:<br><br>What on earth do you take away from all of this? Please answer that question one week, one month, and six months from now.<br><br>Oh yeah, have you started the task yet? My tip, if it is standing out and you want to ask for another tip from the board about it, start doing it. It works, guaranteed.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Norman.  Allison already posted her take-away.  This thread has since meandered onto other subjects.<br><br>Nicole, in your example, I'd say put it on the week page.  Your goal was info about X, not chatting with John.  You are still working on that same task, just rephrased.  In general, just ask yourself one question: "Is this something I'm still working on, or am I done for now?", where by this, I'm referring to the objective behind the task.</div>
