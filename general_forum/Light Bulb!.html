<div class="content">With the release of FVP I have finally had a light bulb come on for me. My revelation may seem obvious, and many of you likely intuitively know what I've realized...<br><br>I have always been drawn to these task management systems, yet was never satisfied with my day to day life when using them. FVP really does seem to be a great way to work through a list, and yet it still doesn't seem to be what I'm looking for. Why is that? How could it be that such a well thought out method doesn't give me a calm/organized life?<br><br>My light bulb moment came when I realized that I don't really need a way to work through a list. If I've got a decent handle on my tasks/obligations/projects/up-coming items then I don't have an issue rolling up my sleeves and getting things done. The issue then it would seem is that I need a method to be able to organize all my spinning plates. I need to know what is coming up and if action needs to be done. I need to know what things I will get to someday, but not sure when. I need to know that my next few days will be spent on things that make sense. <br><br>So, using task based systems is akin to using a screwdriver to nail a nail. It might sort of work, but not really. <br><br>Where do I go from here? Kaban? Suggestions?<br>I'm tired of a system telling me to work on things when what I really need is a method to "see" my life possibilities.</div>

<div class="content">Try integrating your smartphone to your list. <br><br>The reason why I cannot shift to pen and paper is that my whole task system is actually my smartphone, my BlackBerry Z10.<br><br>Central is whatever task management system I am using. Currently it is FVP, but I just might go back to DECAF because I am missing the ability to manage projects easily. The app I am using is the phone's proprietary Remember app.  The smartphone's OS boasts an excellent virtual "intelligent" keyboard that allows quick input, and the app's simple and intuitive interface allows quick manipulation of items.<br><br>BB10's "Hub" integrates email, text messages, and alerts and interpersonal messages from other apps and websites like Facebook, Twitter, and BBM into one place; no email backlog for me since I always look at them everytime someone texts me and everytime I look at Facebook and Twitter, and I can answer right away because of the excellent virtual keyboard.<br><br>I have set my calendar so that deadlines and special events show up 1 week in advance so that they can be added to my task list.<br><br>So yeah my smartphone makes it easy for me to have a handle over everything happening in my life.</div>

<div class="content">Tommy:<br><br>I've faced this frustration myself. I think the solution is to get more creative instead of relying on habitual conditioned thinking. I agree with your assertion that getting more of the "wrong" things done isn't productive. But realising they are "wrong" (for you) is an important realisation. So whatever part of you brought you that realisation can bring you other realisations. <br><br>The links above have been helpful to me. Anything that starts to re-wire neuronal circuitry and takes you to a place in your brain beyond your preconceptions is the way forward it seems to me. That, after all, is personal growth.</div>
