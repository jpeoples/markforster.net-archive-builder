<div class="content">I used AF1 for a while until the dragon of Procrastination won, and I've been using AF2 since Monday. I like them both because the focus on intuition is playing to my strength.<br><br>Where I faltered on AF1 was the reluctance to dismiss. So where I am trying to stick to the rules with AF2 is the dismissal rules. They make a lot more sense to me.<br><br>I started with a fresh book (I use a pocket moleskine so I can carry it with me everywhere) for AF2. My old book still has quite a few pages of unactioned items. Many of you have mentioned the idea of the backlog (which I see my old AF1 book representing). Here across the pond in Iowa I haven't read any of Mark's books (autofocus is my intro to his approach, thank you, Mark btw) so the backlog is an unfamiliar concept. Also I can see where some dismissed items need to be done eventually, just not in this live time of autofocus.<br><br>So, the question is: If I set up a recurring item to review dismissed items (including my backlog, someday/maybe list) any recommendations on how often to do that? Or is there another approach to those backlogged and dismissed items, so the good stuff can be done when it needs to be done?</div>

<div class="content">RevDave,<br>You could use another of Mark's techniques - the 'current initiative' - where you do some work on the backlog or project every day, before you work on anything else.  I've been using this approach with a short timed burst most mornings to tackle a lengthy and boring 'clear the clutter' task, and it's making it surprisingly easy. <br>Or you could enter 'do one item from AF1 list' at the end of your AF2 list every day.  Good luck.</div>

<div class="content">RevDave,<br><br>How often to review?  As often as seems right.  ;-)  I'm leaning toward putting items on my list that I EXPECT to do within one week ... I need to experience that longer to see how it plays.  In that case, my inclination is to review at weeks end when I review things and decide what to do next week.  Some have mentioned that they prefer to let dismissed items cool their heels for a month or so.  Basically I think a good rule is:<br><br>- Put items on the list that you are committed to doing within a "reasonable" time (defined by your unique circumstance.<br><br>- Review the dismissed items at the end of that period to see if anything is really screaming to get back on the list.  (Remember you have to COMMIT to doing it in the upcoming time frame so some will not even ask for readmittance because you'll realize that the time is not ripe for them.)</div>
