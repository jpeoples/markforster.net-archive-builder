<div class="content">GTD talks about having a mind like water.  Driven by the wind and tossed about.  Or maybe rather like calm water that takes anything that comes at it and quickly recovers. Or like a river that flows easily along the course life presents it? Or is cool and thirst quenching (refreshing)?  Roiling, boiling, steamy water?  Hm, somehow your mind is supposed to be fully Ninja-ready and that resembles wateriness. Heh. :-)     <br><br>Anyhow, I think once you get the hang of it, this latest system offers resilience to chaos. You know all the important stuff is in there, you will get to it in time; the urgent matters are up front; what you're doing now won't be forgotten, but you'll get back to it soon. <br><br>Therefore, when someone comes in, you can immediately devote your full attention. If it's important enough, you can drop everything for a half hour, no problem. More likely you just need give a few minutes to find out what's up. Take some notes, answer questions, solve some problems, or take on new work, promising to address what's needed in good time.<br><br>Record new items according to urgency. Then you're back to work.  Resume where you left off, switch it up, but sure because it's all in place. <br><br>I'm not there yet, but I feel it won't take long.   </div>

<div class="content">If this was posted on FaceBook I'd click the like button.  What a well worded summary of the cause of the change in my stress levels this last week.</div>

<div class="content">In my book, the whole 'mind like water' analogy is a lot of fluff (just like so much else of GTD). If you're totally on top of your work, it's always easy to take on the occasional surprise challenge, react to it appropriately, and then return to your normal way of operation. <br>SF seems to accomplish just that, for those who are happy with it (me, I didn't try it yet). GTD, probably not so much, in the real world. <br>GTD overloads you systematically. It remains to be seen whether SF does much better in the long run.</div>

<div class="content">GTD always seemed to me like the "brute force" approach to time management.  GTD does provide you with the terminology and tools you need to organize all your processes and all your incoming work and all your obligations, and break them down into "next actions".  It also provides many "best practices" (such as the "weekly review") for ensuring that the whole system stays organized and functional.  It also provides you with different "views" so you can see your daily tasks from a larger perspective and help make sense of it all.<br><br>So, once you've done all that, and you have all your nicely organized lists of "next actions", it's still completely up to you to force yourself to process those lists and get the tasks done.  This is what I mean by GTD being a "brute force" system.  <br><br>Mark's AF systems are so different.   They provide all kinds of helps to deal with the actual human situation, rather than just help get you organized.  They help break down resistance, overcome procrastination, build better habits, and now with SAF, drive towards completion of the results that matter -- all as a matter of course while working the system.<br><br>It's at least an order of magnitude of psychological sophistication beyond GTD.   Mark should get the Nobel Prize for Time Management.  <br><br>You know what, I decided to post this on my blog.  Here it is:  <a href="http://www.cactusforest.net/2011/02/why-mark-forsters-superfocus-is-so-much.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.cactusforest.net/2011/02/why-mark-forsters-superfocus-is-so-much.html</a></div>

<div class="content">On a more simplistic note, I think it is horses for courses. I read GTD with high hopes, but my heart sunk as I read more and more and realised I just am not the sort of person to maintain that sort of system. I would simply forget to do the weekly review, or believe I was too busy to find the time to do it. And having all those lists - well they would just get forgotten - I tend to only 'see' what is in front of me.<br><br>What I like about Mark's systems is that they are easy to manage, you need no fancy tools, just a pen and paper, and it can capture all your commitments and tasks. The tasks sort of present themselves when you are ready to do them.  All I am required to do is write things down in the right place and work through the notebook.</div>

<div class="content">My experience in this context has been that a hybrid of Autofocus and GTD can be made feasible by <br>(1) reducing GTD to a minimum set of three list: a tasks list (called 'next actions list' in GTD), a weekly or fortnightly goals list (called 'projects list' in GTD), and a someday list (same in GTD); and <br>(2) using a suitable method to work through the tasks list, e.g. AF1, AF2 or AF4.</div>

<div class="content">It does seem Mark's system is incredibly sophisticated, but, for me, part of the "psychological sophistication" is that it becomes almost a game to follow the rules get through the lists. You still have to do the dang work, but managing the work can be downright fun.</div>

<div class="content">I began with GTD and follow by AF1 the AF4 THe SFV3<br>MF System are incredibly powerful. I love SF V3 I understand now what means "mind like water"it s a simple feeling of quietness. <br><br>I sill use some GTD tools such as projects, "a weekly or fortnightly goals list (called 'projects list' in GTD), and a someday list (same in GTD)" and even if i change kings of tool, smaller note books, biggers and so on, there is nothing better for me than SF3.</div>
