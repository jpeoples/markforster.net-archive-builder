<div class="content">Absolutly right with you. For me, Goals are not one thing to do among thing to do, Goals are the only thing. <br><br>When you know your job, just focusing on the goal leads you directly on the track. I am working on Goals and they are most important for me than lists or stuff to do. As I explained in an other thread when I spoke about Mac cormack books I could have a simple list of goal on my desk and they can be suffisant to drive me the all day long. <br><br>I also agree that with check list they are the "core system". When you are on a train the most important is the engine. Wagon goes after. Wagon can change and be adapted.<br><br>But the main point is for me to accept that goals are not settled in the marble. They have to be adapted acording to circunstances and settled very practicaly on a short term and long term view. <br><br>I can get rid of todo list, project list, inbox list, omnifocus context list, I can't about goals. <br><br>All my system is built around them and my life follow them little by little.</div>
