<div class="content">Hi Mark<br><br>Something I've wondered for a while and only just got around to asking: How do you perceive your 3 books working together? Is DIT your latest thoughts on Time Management or is it supplementary to what the other two books present. In other words do they each present different aspects of time managment/organisation or are they developments of your ideas with the most recent book being your up to date thoughts (or maybe a combination of both)?<br><br>I'd be interested on your views on this as I've been thinking about it for a while now.<br><br>Thanks for all the books as well as the Website, I've picked up many valuable ideas from them along the way.</div>

<div class="content">Hi, Hannah<br><br>I often get asked this, and the answer is that the books are alternatives to each other rather than developments. That's not to say that one can't use the ideas out of more than one book, but simply that each is designed as a self-contained entity without reference to the other books.<br><br>Some people have difficulty with this, but I tell them that if they treat the books as being by different authors, then they won't have a problem!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark<br><br>Thanks for your reply. I think I had thought this a bit anyway - at least with How to Make Your Dreams Come True as it always seemed separate to the more time management orientation of the other two books.<br><br>I think what I didn't make very clear in my first post was to ask how do YOU make use of the ideas in each of the books. Since you ARE the author of all 3 then presumably they each mean something to you and you consider them all to have useful things to say. So I wondered in what way/s you fit the ideas into your life and work and whether you now find certain methods more useful than others.<br><br>I have found with many of the time management and organisational books I have read, some ideas work well straight away and others less so. Also when I go back to certain books, other aspects which didn't resonate on the first reading will suddenly make more sense and be more relevant as I have changed over time.</div>

<div class="content">Dear Hannah<br><br>As I've said in a recent posting, I have spent the last year experimenting with various new ideas which didn't work.<br><br>So the answer is that I'm still experimenting, and am hence deliberately not using the ideas in my previous books.</div>

<div class="content">Ahh I see!<br><br>I think that for those of us who work from home/run our own business it really can be a case of experimentation to see what works best. <br><br>The thing I find interesting is that as I regularly vary what I do, then I often need to experiment with how I structure what I do. My days don't tend to stay very much the same from one month to the next let alone one year to the next. I am a self employed gardener and am also an artist currently trying to make more time for my painting while cutting back on the gardening which makes for interesting organisational challenges! <br><br>Therefore I am always fascinated to see how others tackle time/self management challenges as other people's methods can often shed light on my own...</div>

<div class="content">I recently purchased all 3 of Mark's books.  Is there a recommended order to read them in?  Perhaps chronological order of copyright?  <br><br>Thanks!<br>Jocie</div>

<div class="content">I would say read Do It Tomorrow first because it presents the most complete system for you to work with. Then use bits of the two other books for additional tricks and methods.</div>

<div class="content">I agree with Nick. Each book is basically self-contained, but DIT does represent my latest thinking (latest published thinking that is).</div>
