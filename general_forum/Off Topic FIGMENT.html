<div class="content">Mike used the word "figment" in another thread in describing Norman U.'s theory of thought.  <br><br>As a wannabe philologist, I was wondering what exactly a "figment" is, when used outside of the context of the phrase "figment of [insert appropriate possessive modifier] imagination".<br><br>Has anyone ever seen the word used outside that context?  Google couldn't help me here, but I'm sure others here are more adept at Googling than I.</div>

<div class="content">Disney World used to have an Imagination ride and the mascot was a fantasy creature named Figment. As in "Hi! I'm Figment of Imagination and we're going on a ride!! " and he (she?) had it's own theme song too.<br><br>Probably not what you had in mind, but that's what I think of whenever I hear 'figment'</div>

<div class="content">By that definition, all figments come from imagination and the phrase is redundant.</div>
