<div class="content">To quote the intro to the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy book, from Wikipedia's entry on Encyclopaedia Galactica: <br><br><br>In many of the more relaxed civilizations on the Outer Eastern Rim of the Galaxy, the Hitchhiker's Guide has already supplanted the great Encyclopaedia Galactica as the standard repository of all knowledge and wisdom, for though it has many omissions and contains much that is apocryphal, or at least wildly inaccurate, it scores over the older, more pedestrian work in two important respects. First, it is slightly cheaper; and second, it has the words "DON'T PANIC" inscribed in large friendly letters on its cover.<br>    —Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy<br><br>Bumping into this site, I was overwhelmed by the number and variety of methods and modifications. So, I was wondering, is there a "Hitchhiker's Guide" for GTD and AF[1,2,3,4], SF[1,2,3], FV, AF2ND, CAF, FV/AF2, DWM[1,2], DIT, and any other noteworthy techniques, which (guide) would compile and present their attributes, similarities and differences (just the core stuff) all in one place and have the words "DON'T PANIC" inscribed in large friendly letters on its cover?<br><br>It is very frustrating to come across all these acronyms and then to have to use Encyclopaedia Galactica, i.e. to Google them or search here in FV/General forums, and then try to figure out the diffs and then decide which one might suit you best. <br><br>It's the perfect way to get lost in the translation and get nothing done...</div>

<div class="content">Stratos:<br><br>The current system recommended by this site is the Final Version (FV):<br><br><a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/</a><br><br>Everything else is purely a matter of historical record.</div>

<div class="content">Is there any place on the site where the FV instructions are published? I remember from when it was introduced that you could receive the instructions by signing up for the FV-newsletter, is that still the only way to get the comprehensive instructions for FV?</div>
