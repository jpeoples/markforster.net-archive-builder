<div class="content">I love my Mac. I'm a graphic designer, and my macbook travels with me to clients, coffee shops, and, dare I say, to bed. I've purchased The Hit List, "borrowed" Omnifocus & Things. None of them felt right when doing AF. So I'd switch to another piece of software, and then another iPhone app. As well, there seems to be a correlation between increased anxiety (personal or work) and a frantic search for a perfect productivity tool. <br><br>I switched to paper two weeks ago, and the results were immediate:<br><br>a) I UNDERSTOOD Mark's madness better with paper - I'm using DWM<br>b) The assembly-line effect of DWM is more apparent with paper<br>c) God bless the iPhone, but it takes 2-3 x's longer to input items with the keypad vs writing<br>d) The sensation of writing helps me focus on what I'm doing or plan to do. <br><br>Anyone else experience something similar?</div>

<div class="content">DianeM: <br><br>Very interesting!  I have waxed and waned between paper and digital since AF1, but have found my current digital method using ListPro the best of the digital route.<br><br>Yet . . . . . . . .<br><br>Your first point reflects why, to me at least, Clara's description of her manual application is so good and enticing, maybe it's a back to basics thing.<br><br>Right now I'm sitting at a lounge in Amsterdam Airport waiting for a flight to Cairo.  I've got time to kill, I might just try seeing what stationery is available and suitable.  I've never tried DWM manually, perhaps digital would be better once the principles have been embedded manually.<br><br>Hmmmm.</div>

<div class="content">DianeM and Rodger,<br><br>I am very much digital in most of my work, but I am doing DWM in a moleskin daily diary.  You are correct; the feel of writing things down is wonderful and makes you think as you write about the entry.  I love computers, and need to use them everyday in my work.  But Mark is right....you just can't beat paper/pen and paper!<br><br>Armistead</div>

<div class="content">My initial attempts at AF and DWM were all paper-based, and I was mostly very happy with that, for all the reasons above. Since DWM, I've moved back to using a Palm, because re-entering tasks at the 1-week page after doing a little bit of work on them drove me nuts. With DateBk6 on the Palm, re-entering a task takes only 2 taps (1 to bring up a menu for the task, and 1 for choosing "one week from today"). The other thing with paper was that I found it very satisfying to start a new notebook, but after a week or so things would start to get messy, and messy makes me nervous...</div>

<div class="content">I love using paper for this.  I love stationery, and I love writing with a fountain pen, so it's a great excuse for a nice notebook, a favourite pen, and my favourite coloured ink (with another pen and ink colour to cross things out etc).<br><br>I find the trick is to keep the notebook size suitable for my lifestyle.  I have to be careful not to go too small as I find that annoying - or too large as it's no longer portable.<br><br>I'm experimenting at the moment with using my A5 size filofax - I can keep my lists, project info, and calendar/diary in here as well. I use outlook synced to my iPhone for calendar.diary, but use the filofax for specific tasks that have to be done on particular days and reminders to send work to people and so on.</div>

<div class="content">I'm using a nice (Moleskine) A5 ruled notebook for DWM. I think someone (Mike?) posted somewhere else that he didn't find paper-based DWM practical. I thought I would add a few lines explaining what I'm doing, since I do find it at least as practical as all of the AFs (with the possible exception of the first incarnation):<br><br>- Mark dates at the top of right of each page (I only use facing pages - the other side I use for journaling - from the back)<br>- Fold down the corners of the +7 day and the +28 day pages - these are the entry points<br>- business card in at my current page as a bookmark (generally I only use this when I'm closing the notebook - otherwise it's open at my desk at the right page). The integral bookmark is used for my journal.<br>- Occasionally I snip off the top-left corners of expired pages to make it easier to turn to the first 'current' page.<br>- Closed pages get a cross in the top-left, with a circle around the cross if there are no earlier tasks<br><br>I think that's fairly simple, minimal overhead, and still looks aesthetically pleasing.</div>

<div class="content">Yeah, I said that I found that my paper based DWM system to be too fiddly but that an electronic one might work.  Mainly because it results in one long list and entering at the one month point can be a default and so takes no thought.  Re-entry at the 1 week mark takes only two clicks so that is easy.</div>

<div class="content">I have tried all the versions of AF using a paper notebook and found AF4 worked really well for me.  I then tried using an electronic version and did not get on so well.  Finally I tried an electronic version of DWM for a month  which did not seem to to work for me either.<br>I am now back to AF4 paper version and after 2 weeks feel very comfortable that I have found the system that works for me.  I still use ToDo Matrix on my Blackberry for things in the future and items recurring say on a monthly basis -  when I receive a reminder I mark the action as completed and enter it into my paper-based system.  <br>For the first time in many years I feel that I have a system that really works and is not over-complicated.  The satisfaction of physically crossing through completed items and seeing them on the paper list is I think part of the reason that it works so well for me.</div>

<div class="content">For me at last nothing is better than paper. Watever my tries can be for a digital way I always be back to paper. Your are absolutly right : <br>b) The assembly-line effect of DWM is more apparent with paper<br>c) God bless the iPhone, but it takes 2-3 x's longer to input items with the keypad vs writing<br>d) The sensation of writing helps me focus on what I'm doing or plan to do. <br><br>I would add<br> e) the obvious feeling to appropriate all the info<br>f) The great pleasure to cross a line with a pen<br>G) The incredible pleasure to throw away a page <br>h) the incredible facility to modify a system at one and work on it right now<br><br>However for the moment i still use ombifocus to collect my projects and add task for the next future</div>
