<div class="content">I've tested my new method of combining AF1 and AF2 now for long enough to confident in letting other people have a crack at it. <br><br>Here's how it works.<br><br>You always start the day in AF2<br><br>How to switch from AF2 to AF1: AF1 is entered as a task on the list. You go back to AF1 whenever that task stands out in the normal course of working AF2. Delete the task and re-enter it like any other recurring task. When going back to AF1 you always start from the beginning.<br><br>How to switch from AF1 to AF2: You switch to AF2 whenever you come to a page in which no tasks stand out for you. The switch therefore takes the place of dismissal in AF1. <br><br>Dismissing tasks is carried out at the beginning of each day in accordance with AF2 rules.<br><br>If for any reason, no switch has been made to AF1 during a day, then the following morning the task "AF1" should be deleted and re-entered at the end of the list. This is to prevent the task from getting buried. [I haven't needed to use this rule yet].<br><br>That's it! Apart from these rules, both AF1 and AF2 are worked exactly as before.<br><br>Just to remind you:<br><br>AF1 is described at <a href="http://www.markforster.net/autofocus-system/" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/autofocus-system/</a><br><br>AF2 is described at <a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2009/6/27/autofocus-2-time-management-system-af2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2009/6/27/autofocus-2-time-management-system-af2.html</a><br><br>A sample AF page is given at <a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2009/7/23/autofocus-2-sample-page.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2009/7/23/autofocus-2-sample-page.html</a></div>

<div class="content">A few comments on the above rules:<br><br>This switch changes the dynamics of both AF1 and AF2. AF1 becomes much less draconian because dismissal is according to AF2 rules. AF2 tends to concentrate on the last few pages and there is less tension pulling you back to the beginning of the list. However what is lost in each system is more than made up by the other system.</div>

<div class="content">Since I've now got bits of this system scattered over various parts of my website, an important task for me now is to write up the combined system. This will be called (surprise!) Autofocus. AF1 and AF2 will be renamed Mode 1 and Mode 2.</div>
<h2>Reply by Mark Forster</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-07-27 9:06</div>
<div class="content">One additional point:<br><br>The combined system shares one important characteristic with AF2 - every task is potentially available for action all the time. This makes the system very responsive to changes in priority or circumstances.</div>

<div class="content">I'm hoping that the instructions will make it clear why you might want to switch to mode 1. Can you find a more emotive name for the two modes? "Important" and "Urgent", for example?<br><br>Just a thought,<br><br>Will</div>

However I may think up better names while writing the instructions.</div>

<div class="content">I'm really looking forward for the unified instructions.<br><br>Will it be necessary for a new user to learn AF1 and AF2 separately before jumping to Autofocus?<br><br>Writing a single set of instructions containing both methods, and how to switch from one to the others sounds like a challenge!<br><br><br></div>

<div class="meta">2009-07-27 11:43</div>
<div class="content">Interesting, and I am happy to give it a try - do I take it that each time I revert to AF1 it will be from the first uncompleted page?<br><br>Also, now we are back to pages being relevant, would my present 13 line pages be too short? I can double the length by combining two pages conceptually (my notebook hinges at the top).</div>
<h2>Reply by Jacqueline</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-07-27 12:07</div>
<div class="content">Laurence - under AF1, don't *all* of the pages become "short" eventually?  As in only a few semi-resisted tasks remaining?  It might even be an advantage if you happen to really enjoy closing pages off.<br></div>

<div class="meta">2009-07-27 12:14</div>
<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>I think the only alternative is, as Walter hints, an apprenticeship for new users so that  "AF1" will mean something to their intuition. <br><br>I don't think that they need pretraining in AF2, as the rules triggering AF2 are mechanical.</div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline<br><br>It's true that all my early pages have become vary short after some weeks with AF2. In fact I have to work with double length pages to give myself some choice.<br><br>This may be an artificial situation. Mark started with a new notebook with (renamed) Autofocus, I'm wondering if we should likewise start afresh.</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br>In your new method, do you ignore highlighted items when in AF1 mode (i.e. which have already been dismissed in AF2)?</div>

<div class="meta">2009-07-27 12:56</div>
<div class="content">Using this modification, I wonder if doing a "dump" of an important project onto a page would be really beneficial?  If it ended up as the first active page in AF1, it could really put the tension on it to work on that project every day (like a current initiative).  <br><br>However, where it could turn disastrous (for me) is that I put on one page of AF1 the following:<br><br>- Chapter 1, scene 1 - write outline<br>- Chapter 1, scene 2 - write outline<br>etc.<br><br>It's been working in AF1 to just pick off the top one and do that task.  Keep going if I feel like it, don't if I don't.  But because they're in a group and can't be broken up, using AF2 they would get considered as an unactioned block and be entirely dismissed.  In this kind of situation, would you recommend just marking for dismissal the top one?   <br><br>I would think this would happen in any situation (like Wooba had happen with his 25 tasks on notice) where one has put a sequential project / checklist into their AF list.  I know it's best not to do that, but when it's broken down like that, it's so much easier to do than "write book" or "write outline", then go to a separate list - which seems too overwhelming, so it doesn't stand out.  <br><br>I'm also asking because I've been progressing on my renos and decluttering so much faster when I've put a semi-sequential list of everything that has to be done as a project onto one page into the list.  But I'll run into the same problem on a lesser scale.  AF1 has been working wonderfully for me as a project management system too when I do this.  Or maybe the solution is to work fast enough that those pages never become the first active page and so don't come up for dismissal.   :-)<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Laurence, <br><br>In AF2 it's an open list, so the pages are irrelevant.  It's only in AF1 that they're closed.   So you shouldn't have to work with double pages in AF2 to give yourself more choices.  <br></div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br>AF2 instructions (and your 3rd comment above) says "The combined system shares one important characteristic with AF2 - every task is potentially available for action all the time. "  <br><br>I never really picked up on that in reading the AF2 rules, maybe because I didn't really know what it meant.  It doesn't seem to be the "if it needs to be done NOW, just do it" rule.  But if I just action a task at random without scanning the list, isn't that just skipping about the list and cherry-picking a task?  I don't see how it fits in with step 2, "Work backwards from the last item looking at each task in turn until a task 'stands out'” and your admonition to start at the end of the list each time.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br><br>I meant while in the AF1 mode, my choice is limited if the page is small.<br><br>Another thing that I notice - AF2 has been much easier to use with a single book, a significant advantage over AF1, which seems to need separate books or lists (for many of us). I am not sure how these different requirements will mesh.</div>

<div class="content">Laurence, you wrote: <<.... do I take it that each time I revert to AF1 it will be from the first uncompleted page?>><br><br>This interests me very much, too. The istructions are not so clear about that. It is for sure that the firt time in the day you swith to AF1 you have to go to the beginning of the list. But what about the second time? <br><br>Suppose you worked in AF1 mode on page P12 (first page) , than on P13, than on page P14. On P14 no tasks stand out for you: so you switch to AF2 mode. After few hours of AF2 the "switch to AF1" task stands out: than you swith to AF1. It seems natural to go to P15, following the original AF1 idea of cycling continuosly trough all the pages.<br><br>If you had to go to P12, P13, P14 again, it is very likely that, again, no tasks stand out, and you had to swith back to AF2, without having taken advantage of AF1.<br><br>Am I right?<br><br></div>

You would really mess up the whole dismissal system doing that. But with the example you give I don't understand why you would want to put Scene 1, Scene 2 etc unless you actually want to work on both at the same time. If you're going to do them sequentially then surely Scene 2 just follows naturally on from Scene 1?</div>

If you were near the beginning of the list and something near the end of the list became urgent, then you could not go directly to it without doing at least one task on each intervening page. This made it necessary to have a separate "do it anyway" rule for urgent items.<br><br>With AF2, if a task in the early part of the list becomes urgent, then it is open to your intuition to make none of the intervening tasks stand out. So you don't have to do any intervening tasks.<br><br>With the new AF1/AF2 system this is still the case because if you are in AF1 and an item becomes urgent somewhere else in the list, then it is open to your intuition to find no tasks it prefers to do on the next page, change to AF2 and then move to the urgent task in the normal AF2 way.<br><br>So what I meant is that the next task can be any task on the list regardless of position without needing to bend the rules.</div>

They're written like this because I have a whole page of that in my book and when it's done, my outline is done.  <br><br>Speed of movement has been an issue with AF so I'm stacking the list.  Say I write "scene 1 - outline" on my list, a week or so later, it stands out and I do it and then write "scene 2 - outline", a week or two later....  Needless to say, progress isn't as fast as doing it pretty much every day.  <br><br>I don't want to pick holes in something I haven't tried so I'll just cross my fingers that they stand out better for me than they have in the past.<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi All,<br><br>I'm totally new at this (2 days in), but I think I have an example similar to Jacqueline's. <br><br>I'm trying to get more exercise and thought if I put some different options down and was seeing them on the list constantly, they would jump out at me and I'd do them more often. <br><br>But I've consciously not put them all in a row out of what I think is the same dismissal concern Jacqueline has. <br><br>If I have on my list all in a row:<br><br>swim<br>weights<br>ride bike<br>walk<br><br>then they could end up all game for dismissal at the same time. I'd probably end up having time for just one and deleting the rest, whereas if they came up in different dismissal windows, I'd hopefully do each rather than dismiss it.<br><br>(Apologies to Jacqueline if this is not at all what you meant.)<br></div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline:<br><br><< I'm not sure I understand the working on both at the same time part. >><br><br>I mean that when writing one doesn't necessarily have to write chapters/scenes/sections in the same order that they appear in the final document. You might start on Section 5, do some work on Section 3, then go back to 5, then work on Section 1, and so on. In that case it would make sense to put all the scenes on the list.<br><br>But if you are going to work on Scene 1, then Scene 2, then Scene 3 in rigid order, then it makes no sense at all (to me anyway) to put them all on the list.</div>

So if you found that you had gone swimming, but hadn't found any time to do weights, ride your bike or go for a walk, then you might query whether you really have time to do all four, and whether you'd do better just to concentrate on the swimming.<br><br>In any case, even if you do put them all in the list in one block, they will get split up as you do them and re-enter them.</div>

<div class="content">Mark, I understand now where you're coming from.  I was trying to develop the outline first (sequentially because I think in that way in a fiction plot).  It's not like when I have written before (articles, essays, business plans - which have a very regimented structure) where I have always written similarly to how you described in one of your books - point form then expand - kind of a ramble and then edit down (like my posts - which have a lot of the ramble and none of the editor) .  All in the hopes that after I did that outline, I could do exactly what you suggest and write a scene that happened to stand out to me.  <br><br>I think I will work very fast on this to make sure I don't have to dismiss!  :-)<br><br>Thanks, as always for your patience.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the response Mark,<br><br><<We need to be clear that the threat of dismissal is intended to encourage you to do them - not discourage you!>><br><br>Absolutely! It would be discouraging for me to have to dismiss some of the items because they happened to be contiguous and I can't all do all of them on the same day. I guess I was trying to hasten the spreading out of the items and avoid the discouragement of having to dismiss some of them. I'm only two days in and on a steep learning curve.<br><br>I don't really want to focus on just one form of exercise or set up a rigid schedule to stick to (and quickly fall off of). I just want to be reminded that exercise is a good option for times when I'm resistant to other tasks or am just in the right mood. Autofocus seems like it could work well for this, but I'll know better after a few weeks.</div>

<div class="content">Will: I have some old pages with only one or two open items. And the end of the list (the last two or three pages) consist of a lot of fun stuff, so it will stand out whenever I try to go back to close these old pages (you just can't keep fun stuff from standing out if you don't have the whole day to work on your list). So my old pages stay open until the dismissal line comes up. And whether I manage to do the one or two items up for dismissal depends on a lot more factors than just my own intuition (imagine coming home in heavy rain with some gardening task ready to be dismissed).<br><br>That's why I just switched to AF1 mode ...</div>

<div class="content">For those of us who have digital AF2 lists, this combo will probably be more trouble than it's worth. I am not struggling with AF2, but if I were, I might just add a task to start working from the beginning of the list. I might also have a task that reads return to the end of the list since I have no "pages" that can prompt this.</div>

<div class="content">Been using the combo for a day now, and it's great!!<br><br>The funny thing is, I ran right into what I thought was a potential problem with this way of combining AF1 and AF2. I had three tasks on notice for dismissal, which were spread over two pages (1 on the last line of the first active page, 2 on top of the second active page). At some point, I switched from AF2 to AF1 to work on this 'on notice' block, but I found myself resisting the first task. Because that was the only task left on that page, I had to switch back to AF2, where I worked some tasks, and then switched to AF1 again. Where, again, I found myself resisting the first on notice task, so I switched back to AF2, getting a bit mad at the system that this way I would never reach the second and third on notice tasks, and fearing I would end up having to dismiss all three of them.<br><br>At the third switch to AF1, I finally realised that if I really wanted to get all three tasks done today, I would have to do them, period. What a revelation :-). I ended up doing them all three, and three more on the second page.<br><br>Mark, you rock!</div>

<div class="content">I can definitely foresee a problem with this switch ..... I hadn't expected to use it as I was finding AF2 so good but decided to give it a go.  The "problem" is that it has accelerated AF even more!  By reverting to AF1 I have now cleared tasks that I would have had on notice over the next few days which is accelerating my dismissal line.  At this rate I'll be dismissing tasks before I enter them!!  <br><br>Out of curiosity I set up my stats spreadsheet to estimate dates of closing pages, assuming only 1 item per day being up for dismissal (which I expected to balance out with non-AF days).  So far, on day 1 of using the switch method the estimates have reduced by 4 days - and I only switched for a very brief period of time.  There is so much less resistance to tasks under AF1 without the page dismissal and the page I am resisting will be demolished by that red line within 2 days now instead of nearly two weeks!!</div>

<div class="content">And what a fine car the Lada is too: simple, robust, goes forever with a minimum of maintenance.<br><br>Bit of a problem with the heater matrix, but what do you expect if you take a thoroughbred classic and then give it fancy western tweaks (like heating)?<br><br>Hmm: perhaps there's a message in there somewhere?</div>

<div class="content">Hi, I have a few questions. Since switching to AF1 is a task, and not a fixed rule:<br><br>- Why should it stand out ? It's not a task like "Pay bills". What would be the motivation to make it stand out?<br><br>- Similarly, when would I add it to the list? Meaning, what would be the trigger for me to want to add it?<br><br>Thanks!<br></div>

<div class="content">Walter:<br><br>The main motivation would be that you felt that the beginning of the list needed more methodical attention.<br><br>You'd add the task to the list on your first day of using this method, and re-enter it whenever you actioned it like any other recurring task.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Walter,<br><br>the way I've worked it, and how I understand it from Mark's instructions:<br><br>I add the task "switch to AF1" when I start working on AF2 in the morning. I cross it off when it stands out, and re-enter it whenever I switch back to AF2. That way the switching task is always close to the end of the list.<br><br>The task stands out for me whenever I have the feeling that there are items at the beginning of the list which are more important than whatever I'm encountering in AF2 mode at the end of the list. I do look back at the beginning of the list every now and then, to keep a feeling for what I'm not doing while working from the end.<br><br>Hope this helps!</div>

<div class="content">Hi<br><br>I'm finding that I'm switching to AF1 mode simply when I don't feel then's anything particularly urgent that needs doing.  I always liked the way AF1 would force me to do at least something on at least one task before allowing me to move on to the next page.<br><br>I'm also giving myself a free pass if the only items left on a page are ones that can't be done in my current location. This allows me to stay in AF1 mode for a little longer.<br><br>Martin<br></div>

<div class="content">Nicole: <br><br>"The task stands out for me whenever I have the feeling that there are items at the beginning of the list which are more important than whatever I'm encountering in AF2 mode at the end of the list. "<br><br>AF2 states that you should read your entire list before each session.  If after doing that, you are aware that there are important tasks at the beginning, wouldn't that affect the way you pick what to do when going backwards? <br><br>As opposed to AF1, you can happily travel the list without doing anything until you reach your older tasks.<br><br><br>Mh... Thinking about it, moving to AF1 seems to me like going into "maintenance mode", acting not out of urgency, but just to move the entire list forward, in a fashion.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Mark: About a free pass if the items left on a page can't be done in the current context:<br><br>As I spend quite a lot of my discretionary time sitting in a train, this happens quite often. Without a free pass I don't have to switch to AF1 at all because I'd just have to switch back immediately. A free pass still allows me to work on pages I wouldn't reach in AF2 (as I keep chasing bright shiny things).<br><br>But you're right, it didn't quite work in plain AF1. But I expect it to work better with AF1/AF2 and I'll keep testing.</div>

<div class="content">After trying and thinking a lot about this AF1 / AF2 switching, it just stroke me that in fact, we are finally showing here how to deal with Covey's 4 quadrants. <br>I always liked this simple way to hierarchise actions, without really understanding how to keep all quadrants moving.<br>We've got the answer here with this global autofocus system !<br><br>Urgent and important stuff is done first in AF2 mode. Then urgent but not important actions are dealt with in AF2 mode, alternatively with important but not urgent actions, which are dealt with in AF1 mode. Not urgent and not important things are the ones that get automatically dismissed, or done if there is some time left.<br>Thank you so much Mark.</div>

<div class="content">@Will: you are right. I should not write posts before my first cup of tea.<br><br>The reason i call the modes 'open' vs. 'closed' is the different mindset while working in the corresponding mode. In open mode the whole list is there for me to choose from. Especially the new and, at least for my mind, most prominent tasks. In closed mode i HAVE to choose from a limited set of tasks, the old and most resisted, or i have to leave the closed mode. I love that principle! That is more than just going forward or backward.<br></div>

<div class="content">@Alexborne<br><br>makes perfect sense. Years ago i used to have a large cardboard with the four quadrants painted on it. Tasks where written on yellow stickes and put in the corresponding quadrant. The Autofocus solution is much more portable ;-) And it sizes better.<br></div>

<div class="content">Walter: yes, theoretically I should be aware of the important stuff after reading through the list first morning. However, as Lazy Cat wrote, working back in AF2-mode it can be difficult to get to the beginning of the list because of "bright, shiny things." Switching to AF1-mode is an easier way of ignoring those bright shiny things.</div>

<div class="content">Mark, <br><br>I feel that a free pass in AF1 mode is something that those of us who don't work from home really need.  If you set yourself up in an experiment where you pretended that you had gone to an office away from home every day for 10 or 11 hours, I think you would see where we're coming from.<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark<br><br><<And there was I thinking that the Lada was based on the Fiat 124. >><br>Wasn't it the Fiat 128?  Going by past experience it's more likely that you're right than me :-)<br><br>I agree with Jacqueline - when I use my list away from home I can only do certain tasks.  To dismiss everything else would not have been practical.  The AF1/AF2 switch is quite different to how I expected.  There is far less resistance in AF1 mode than in original AF1 which had been why I was initially reluctant to try the switch.  Trouble is my stats are no longer showing nice neat coloured patterns as I am now clearing pages in the middle rather than primarily at the beginning and end :-(</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark<br><br>Is there anything you don't know? Having owned a Fiat 128 many moons ago and having always been led to believe that the Lada was the Russian version I thought I might just be right on this one but on looking it up I see that you are definitely right as usual. Apparently though it is a common misconception that it was the 128 so I won't sulk about it! :-)</div>

<div class="content">My Fiat was nowhere as near as much of a rust bucket as as a Ford I owned (very briefly - in fact if I recall it was temporary vehicle when my Fiat was written off). When I expressed surprise that it had failed an MOT on rust the garage owner lifted up the carpet in the passenger seat well - underneath was the road!!!</div>
