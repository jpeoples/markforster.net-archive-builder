<div class="content">I hope this isn't too off topic, but think it's fairly relevant as I'm sure some productivity items will be included.<br><br>This week I've switched to iPhone from Windows/Android. (I didn't have any problems with my old phone, it's just come time to upgrade and I fancied a change!). I'm wondering what apps the IOSrs here consider to be the "must have"s?<br><br>Actually, for that matter, what are the must have apps for any platform? My tablet is Kindle Fire and my laptop Windows 10, so I suppose I'm straddling all three OSs.</div>

<div class="content">Overcast instead of Podcasts (just a cleaner, more intuitive design)<br>Gmail instead of Mail (I don't like Google Inbox)<br>Lyft instead of Uber (I think the company is more ethical)<br><br>Those are my essentials. I'm actually enjoying iBooks for reading PDFs and books, but it can be a pain sometimes to move a file there. If you email yourself the file, you can move it to iBooks that way.<br><br>I'd recommend Instapaper as well, although I don't use it much these days as it just ended up being a place where I would put all the stuff that I would never read. Still, the way it filters out the ads and gives you a clean reading experience is great. It also syncs on pretty much every device.<br><br>Also, if you got an iPhone 6 or later, it is the first time they've allowed adblockers for web browsing. So, I'd get one of those.</div>

<div class="content">Mark and Jesse,<br><br>Interesting, thanks. I've been thinking about a walking app so just downloaded Map my Walk.<br><br>I will check out Overcast too.<br><br>I guess my most used apps are:<br><br>Goodreads<br>Onedrive<br>BBC Weather<br>Spotify<br>Microsoft Word<br>What's App<br>Wikipedia<br>indeed Jobs<br>BBC News<br>Clean Master<br>Songsterr (for guitar tabs)<br>Trip Advisor<br>Banking app<br>Facebook (less and less)<br>Oxford English Dictionary/Dictionary.com<br><br>Like everyone, I now use digital technology in most areas of my life. One thing I don't ever see myself doing, however, is reading books digitally. I still find paper and ink vastly superior to reading off a screen.</div>

<div class="content">"Like everyone, I now use digital technology in most areas of my life. One thing I don't ever see myself doing, however, is reading books digitally. I still find paper and ink vastly superior to reading off a screen" <br><br>I notice we all balance between paper and digital. I absolutly agree with you. Paper and ink is incredibly superior for me than digital files or even databases. There is a stange effect in acting and writing it makes in my mind a kind of mechanic which free my intuition and is over addictive with me. So even if I use many digital tools when I make heuristic shemes or paper list I stick to it. When I do it digitaly it seem to vanaish in the air and I am un able to appropriate the information. I have asked this around me with many friends. When they have to act little by little and constantly they also feel better with paper.</div>

<div class="content">**Clear** (for simple lists, shopping, today tasks...)<br><br>I never imagined about how such a simple app can work miracles. There is something in the visual design + gestures which motivate me to stick with it. Also, sync with Clear mac app is very quick and reliable now.<br><br>**Fleksy** - alternative keyboard, absolutely worth the price, I type 3x faster<br><br>- Things<br>- Evernote<br>- CalCube - for great weekly view and quick jump to very distant future dates<br>- Calendars (by Readdle) - a.o. great for copying/duplicating appointments which I use often + nice weekly view<br>- Alarmed <br>- Footsteps<br>- Randomness (e.g. for Mark`s randomness method)</div>

<div class="content">I've tried probably 50+ time management apps for the iPhone.  The only ones I still really use are the standard iOS Reminders app (for shopping lists, and reminders of things to ask my car mechanic about, and stuff like that), and the standard iOS calendar app.<br><br>A key advantage of using the standard iOS apps is integration with Siri.</div>
