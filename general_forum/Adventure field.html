<div class="content">AF4 is sweet.  <br><br>I have a little trick I'm using that you can add to your arsenal for overcoming resistance.  I now call my list (but only to myself) my "Adventure Field" (ie. "A.F.").  <br><br>There's already a bit of excitement in working the list, but by simply "relabeling" it, it helps to focus me on "expecting something good".  <br>My AF list is full of different 'adventures' that I can go on.  <br><br>Of course, it helps to keep adding little "treasures" in the list too - don't only add turgid dry work, but things that you really want to do as little treats for when you're feeling you've done enough other stuff to justify it (eg. 'read a chapter of xxx', 'look at AF forum', '10 mins online holiday research').  For me, 'tidy desk' functions like one of these 'treats'...but maybe that's just me.<br><br>Along a similar line, working out a way to make a task sound fun can help, as can directly attaching a reward to the completion of the task.  (eg.  'When I've finished xxx, I can open those biscuits').  Clearly, too many of these will just clutter things, but a few can help.<br><br>The challenge is as much about our attitude to the list as it is to keeping track of everything.<br><br>Well, this treat's finished.  Time to return to my Adventure Field.  I wonder what's ready to be picked?</div>

<div class="content">I am reminded of the Destruct-o-matic task tracker from David Seah. <a href="http://davidseah.com/archives/2005/11/13/task-progress-destruct-o-matic-edition/" rel="nofollow">http://davidseah.com/archives/2005/11/13/task-progress-destruct-o-matic-edition/</a><br>The playground machine gun and explosion sound effects are compulsory, especially for cube dwellers.</div>
