<div class="content">Hmmm, the more I get into AF the more interesting it becomes...<br><br>A thought just struck me  - if I kept a list of meals I want to eat, and used AF to decide what I want to buy , what I wanted to cook etc., my rational / intuitive sides to my brain should "kick in" and help me lose weight without any stress right? <br><br>Any thoughts?<br><br>Derek</div>

<div class="content">Freaky Derek.  I thought of this about a month ago.  I didn't implement it, but let me know if it works for you and I might give it a shot!</div>

<div class="content">I do it. I also put in stuff that seems "contrary" to my goals that I think I would like to do. This comes from a little advice Mark had when I posted about cutting back on Red Bull consumption. It worked.<br><br>Write it all down and let AF sort it out.<br></div>

<div class="content">Great, Norman. I was going to ask you how you got on with that.</div>

<div class="content">Drinking Red Bulls just starting becoming dismissed tasks. Great advice. Thanks a lot.</div>

<div class="content">Good luck with stopping smoking. I used tobacco for most of my life and toward the end I was a moderate user, only smoking 2-3 packs a day.<br><br>If you would like some tips, let me know.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">I don't need to lose weight, but I have been intrigued by the idea of someone trying to diet by writing "Eat 100 calories" into his or her Autofocus list twenty times at the start of each day.</div>

<div class="content">Derek, just my $.02 from when I quit back in '97 - there's no reason why you can't do both at the same time.  I don't care what the "experts" say - at least try to maintain.  I actually lost weight the first month after I quit.  Then I let up the reins on my way of eating because I talked myself into thinking I deserved to have junk food and put on about 25 pounds in 6 months.  Even though I was running every day for an hour, I still packed on the pounds.<br><br>Quitting smoking wreaks havoc with your blood sugar and insulin levels.  If I were to do it again, I'd start a lower carb diet a couple of weeks before my quit day and get into an exercise routine too.  Doing both of these help with cravings.<br><br>Have you ever quit before?<br><br>Dan, would you give yourself bonus points if you *didn't* complete all of the items?  Or save them up for a big binge?   :-)</div>

<div class="content">Some other tasks you could add that would support the goal include:<br>Drink a glass of water<br>Record what I ate<br>Purge some unhealthy food from the fridge/pantry<br>Find a new low-fat or low-cal recipe online<br>Review reasons for losing weight (alternatively, you could just include these throughout your list to read and then check-off, possibly re-adding)</div>

<div class="content">Derek--<br>Just realized that I use my AF list this way, but not for dieting. I often buy food I intend to cook and then forget. I put it on my AF list. Sometimes it still gets dismissed, but it does help!</div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline -<br><br>Sure, why not save them up?  100 calories today is pretty much the same as 100 calories tomorrow, right?<br><br>As an added bonus, you will have to make it all the way through your AF list at least three times a day if you want to eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner.<br><br>-dp<br></div>

<div class="content">I do put reminders to track my weight watchers data in my AF list (but not often enough if the scale is any indication).<br><br>*puts it back on the list*</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for all the tips folks, I'm using an AF as "little steps" approach to healthy lifestyle:<br><br>put on nicotine patch, dont smoke<br>drink 6 pints water<br>Run every day<br>2000 net cals  per day<br>cut sugar<br>cut salt<br>etc etc.<br><br>Thanks Mel for some more ideas!<br><br>They are listed one above the other  in AF and I'll keep everything beow the top live item dismissed until I am convinced I've cracked the first step.<br><br>For me it has to be one step at a time, but the all or nothing approach may work for others  - this AF thing is great as it can be tailored to suit everyone, love it.<br><br>regards<br><br>Derek.<br><br><br><br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>Are you still following the 'No S' diet?<br><br>If you've dropped or changed it, any reasons why?<br><br>cheers,<br>Pete.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">LOL @ the "No S" diet. Reinhard is great. He is my kinda guy, a lot of thinking and figuring to find an elegant, obvious, and long used solution. I have always enjoyed his work. The Shovelglove is a hoot. A strange but utterly simple and effective idea for keeping fit.<br><br>Thanks for the reminder.</div>

<div class="content">So much for attention and focus. "Multitasking" is the euphemism for "idleness".</div>

<div class="content">smileypete:<br><br>No, I followed it for about four weeks, if I remember correctly. I lost quite a bit in Week 1, but by the end of Week 4 had put it all back on again.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Mark,<br><br>The 'No-S' diet is what I call a 'heuristic' diet, it seems they're better for improving healthy eating habits rather than losing weight alone. Eating 5 portions of fruit or veg a day is a well known one. <br><br>Something I've been following for a while is to eat 1 portion of white flour based food a day, eg bread, batter, pastry, pasta, pizza etc. Since white flour isn't very filling it should help with calorie intake too.</div>
