<div class="content">I've been using "Autofocus" for about 12 days and it's working quite well for me. However, before I started using "Autofocus" (before I'd even heard of "Autofocus") I ordered the book "Do it tomorrow."  The book finally arrived today (shipped from England so it took a long time) and its arrival prompts the following question.  To those who know the book, is there anything I can learn from it now (I mean, now that I'm using Autofocus)?  Are there any sections (or concepts) that still seem relevant and useful? I ask, not because I am unhappy with Autofocus, but because, having finally gotten this book, I'd like to put it to some use.</div>

<div class="content">I'm a big fan of DIT (although I never quite managed to implement it fully) and there are some excellent concepts in it that really helped me when I was struggling at work due to just too much work. I think it is probably worth reading all the book but the key things for me were:<br><br>the concept of one day's work - this helped me look at my workload and put a business case forward to get extra resources in my team at work<br><br>how to deal with backlogs so that they don't get any worse - two steps here, the first was to close the backlog and deal with it seperately and the second was to make sure you have a system in place to deal with that type of work (in my case emails)<br><br>do it tomorrow - the concept of not just reacting but putting a space in between receiving something to action and then taking the action. This works in AF as well as a new task goes on the end of my list, I might still deal with it today, but not necessarily immediately. Mark gives some really good examples in his book.<br><br>I'm sure if I give it some more thought I would come up with more suggestions and examples - but read the book and see what you think</div>

<div class="content">Do It Tomorrow (DIT) and Autofocus (AF) are not that far removed, they both utilise the concept of ‘Closed Lists’.  DIT contains lots of useful information – chapter 2 ‘The Principles’ gives you a quick overview. If you want to dip into the book that might be the best place to see what appeals or might be interesting. <br><br>I would say though, just read it from start to finish. It is well written and quite a quick read.  Depending on how quick you read it could take as little as a day to get through it overall.  What I would say though is read it more than once, not because it is hard to understand but because it contains lots of different principles.<br><br>All the best<br><br>Steve<br></div>

<div class="content">Read it all - AF or DIT's task diary will help you plan your day but if you really want to manage your time in the long term rather than just planning one day ahead forever then you'll need the other information in DIT to stop the backlogs forming, to decide when something isn't worth taking and and how to establish long term goals and direction. I like  my task diary and I like AF but it's the other stuff in DIT that's made the biggest difference to me - I still have days and weeks when things are disorganized and hectic (I'm still an easily distracted procrastinator, afterall) but these days I spend more time on real planning work (not on busy work), I have solid longterm plans for managing new intake and dealing with backlogs (which work) and I can take a project on and finish it on time. <br><br>If you substitue AF for the task diary in DIT then everything else will be relevant.</div>

<div class="content">Absolutely agree Steve.  DIT and both of Mark's other books contain a vast number of helpful tips and techniques which can run with AF, particularly in the arena of backlogs and planning.</div>
