<div class="content">This is Day 2 for me and is seems to all make sense.  I am an IT project manager and also hold a supernumary role as a technical project group lead (like a practise manager for PM's).<br>I found starting the first day great in the knowledge that it had a beginning "and an end".  However I had to carry over three tasks from my list to Day 2.<br>Day 2 looks like another three to carry over and of the list of things I have running around in my head I am already scheduling things two weeks ahead!  This is on the basis that I forward fill a day with a max of four tasks, allowing space for filling the rest of the day, the day before.<br>A lot of my tasks typically take 1-2 hrs to execute and I am aware that I don't have to do it all at once and can break it down into stages - the stages are still 1-2hrs.  Allowing time for scheduled tasks, meetings, conference calls etc - you can't cram many 1-2hrs tasks into a day and still have time to work on your Current Initiative and other daily tasks.<br><br>My concern is that if I 'fix' things by spreading them out over a long planning horizon, I will probably realise little improvement over my old regime and my commitment to DIT won't last.<br><br>Too much work? - possibly<br>Too little time? - seems like it<br>Broken system/Inefficiency? - can't see it<br><br>[I must say I love turning off my email notification and checking it only a couple of times per day.]<br><br>Interested in people's thoughts<br>Regards<br>Rob</div>

<div class="content">Ahhh... I may have found something.  Looking at your article on "The top ten tips..." I saw the statement about estimating time required, being a great skill.<br>Looking at tomorrow, when I take out meetings, calls and 30mins for lunch - I have 4.5hrs available to get things done.  When I estimated what was on my list for tomorrow, I tallied up 7hrs 25mins of work! Setting myself up for failure.  <br>I will try and reduce my Will Do List to match the time available and see how tomorrow goes.<br>Wish me luck!<br>Rob</div>

<div class="content">In my experience most people underestimate how long a task will take. If anything you also need to build in a definite time to 'just think/plan etc and not just complete specific tasks. Do you have to deal with lots of unplanned reactive tasks from other people by way of troubleshooting etc? If you have a role that needs to respond to others' requests immediately, then perhaps a whole chunk of time needs to be included within your daily list? I used to find it difficult to plan a daily list as I did a customer service / reception role and did have to respond quickly to anything that came in.I just had to accept that I shouldn't put too much on my daily list of specific tasks that had to be done.  I wonder what Mark will say in response?</div>

<div class="content">Cheers Debbie - I don't find my job too reactive and I am able to say "yes but not now" without too much difficulty.<br>Last night I ditched two tasks and cut down one to make my Will Do list fit the time available.<br>I am amazed at the difference it made to the two previous days.  One task I didn't get to at all (but I am probably resistant because the scope is openended) and one threw up some unforeseen problems when I started it.  But apart from that I got everything else done as well as 5 same day tasks which turned up.  There were a couple of daily task items I missed but to be honest, it was Friday and I probably could have done them if I really applied myself.<br>I am most impressed as I think putting down the estimated time per task and then the actual throughout the day, made a huge difference.</div>
