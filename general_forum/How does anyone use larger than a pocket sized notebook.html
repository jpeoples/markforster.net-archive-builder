<div class="content">Hello all, I've followed this forum and the blog for a long time (since DIT). But there are some issues that have kept me from jumping in. So now I've decided to put them all out there one by one and to see if I can make this work for me.<br><br>First is notebook size. If a notebook is larger than pocket sized, where do you put the to do items as they pop up for you? For me, so much comes to mind as I'm doing things around the house or just out and about. So it seems I'd be spending a lot of time copying the items into my desktop notebook from a pocket sized intake method.<br><br>How do you that use larger sized notebooks handle this?<br><br>Thanks in advance.</div>

You may find that you don't have quite as many items to copy across as you think.</div>

<div class="content">I currently carry a 5x7 notebook (whatever size Moleskine is closest to that) in my purse but I'm going smaller than that when I fill this one.</div>

<div class="content">My thoughts entirely Lynn, that's why I use a single A7 ring bound notebook, always with me. When a book is complete, pages which are still in use can with care be transferred to the new book, so no copying is necessary.</div>

<div class="content">I use A7 index cards - for portability reasons. But this year I started to leave them at home (I have a split system for home and work and fixed stuff to do while travelling - in the train). Most of my capturing goes (and always went) to a different system and is transferred when I'm at home. <br><br>Therefore: I had the same concerns, but in my case, they proved to be not as important as expected.<br><br>By the way: the transfer has two advantages: First, it makes capturing easier, because I don't have to think about where the stuff will go and whether I want to/can do it now. Second, I often start out with a rather fuzzy idea that gets refined a bit before I put it into AF4 (usually during walking from/to the train station - wonderful thinking time).</div>

<div class="content">What Lazy Cat said. My AF4 notebook is an A5-sized Moleskine, but I capture everything in an A7-sized notepad that fits in any pocket.</div>

<div class="content">Capture tools: A7 index cards (always with me) and A6 notebook.<br>Autofocus-List tool: A5 notebook.<br>Someday-List tool: A4 notebook.<br><br>Before I transfer an idea or an information from my capture tool to my AF4 list, I decide if  it really has to  go onto the AF4 list , or if it's better to write it on the someday list, or the calendar, or elsewhere or trash it.</div>

<div class="content">Interesting, Rainer.  I decide where it belongs *after* I put it in my AF4 list.  It's part of how I evaluate tasks I come across.</div>

<div class="content">Lynn,<br><br>Returning to your original post, in AF1 Mark advised users to carry a pocket-sized book when AWAY from the "formal" AF list.<br><br>One of the reasons I favoured A5 sized notebooks when I was 100% manual was because an A5 size book can fit into most pockets, briefcases etc.  A6 can be used for when one is away from the formal A5 notebook.<br><br>Nowadays I use a combo system: ListPro (on computer and PDA/Windows Phone, synchronised).  I print out daily the ListPro AF4 list sectioned into Daily Routine, Backlog/Closed DIT, Backlog/Closed non-DIT, and Current/Open.<br><br>At the start of each day, I print the ListPro list.  New or started, but uncompleted tasks from the ListPro list are written in AFTER the end of the list.  Completed tasks are crossed out, as are any written tasks if they are tackled.  Thus after printing, I am essentially back in manual mode although I also "tick/delete" tackled tasks n ListPro as well if I remember<br><br>At the end of the day, I do the following:<br><br>(1) Cross out in ListPro all tackled tasks EXCEPT for Daily Routine tasks ie any crossed out electronically, these are restored as unticked for the next day<br>(2) Any UNtackled tasks written down are typed into ListPro ready for the next day.<br>(3) When the time is ready for review in terms of AF4, I can change the status of tasks very quickly eg Current/Open tasks could become Backlog/Closed.<br><br>The next day I start again by printing the ListPro list (updated) again.<br><br>So my daily AF list is ONE A4 sheet, with the ListPro list printed as 2 x A5 pages on one side.<br><br>BUT, I also carry an A5 or similar-sized Moleskine most of the time in which to write notes, doodling etc, with the day's AF4 list folded in half and tucked into the A5/Moleskine notebook.<br><br>Works for me.<br><br>Roger J</div>

<div class="content">What Alan said.  My AF book IS my capture tool.  Once an item hits it, then I decide if it is:<br><br>- a "someday/maybe" in which case it gets "yellow lined" right then;<br>- it is just something I  want to note but not do anything about, in which case it gets immediately crossed out;<br>- it is an action item, in which case it is processed by AF rules.<br><br>My one meta rule of organization is to have only a single place for things.  Everything at least passes through the AF book so if I need to find it, there will be footprints there.</div>

<div class="content">Mike,<br><br>I too have the one place rule.  I find that by following this relentlessly, it brings more peace of mind and is a huge time saver.  For instance all of 2009 paid bills went into one file.  When it comes to do taxes, I can get organized in about an hour even though the bills are not in any great order or system.  <br><br>Same for writing, I only write in one place.  I find that no matter what system I have used if all my lists, notes to-dos etc are in one place, I am ok as long as I follow this rule.  Again while you may need to flip around the one tool, it is still less time consuming than hunting multiple places.<br><br>Organization in my opinion definitely follows the 80/20 principal, 20% of the things you do can add 80% of the value, which is why in my opinion simple systems work better and last longer.<br><br>Gerry<br><br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div>

<div class="content">I'm still learning here as I am quite new, but I had a very nice set of three field notes for Christmas and I use one of these in my handbag to capture things when I am out and about. They are very slim so can fit into any bag or pocket.<br><br>I'm using an A4 notebook - mainly becuase I have always have, and I had some spare in my 'home' office.  I may gravitate towards smaller (A5 or the nearest paperblanks equivalent) notebooks over time if I think I can make it work.<br><br>I agree that simplest is best.  For example I tend to use a 'day' book. This is an A4 notebook in which I write notes from all my meetings and phone calles. It works well as I only have one place to look for information. However I have been thinking of writing up longer term project details on paper and filing in the project file as it may be easier when I am working on it.  I am going to try it out and see if it can work, but will still keep my day book to avoid having bits of paper all over my desk.</div>
