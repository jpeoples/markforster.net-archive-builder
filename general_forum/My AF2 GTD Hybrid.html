<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-07-6 2:08</div>
<div class="content">For more than a month now I have been using an approach I've described before of having associated lists. I have mentioned some of my lists (Blog ideas, books to read, errands to run, etc.). I have begun using more and more of these lists which has made my standard AF2 list quite short. For example, rather than have:<br><br>Clean out microwave<br>Scrub kitchen floor<br>Wash windows<br><br>on my main AF list, I only have CLEAN written on my main AF list. I can then check my associated CLEAN list for tasks that I work in the same way as my main list. I have started using dismissal rules for the associated list only when I revisit it. I only dismiss the last ONE of these associated list tasks as the lists are still comprised of one large uninterrupted block for now. In the future I plan to dismiss blocks. For example, the task CLEAN on my main AF list stands out. I open my associated list and start scanning down to determine what stands out. The last task on the CLEAN list is Wash windows and the last time I used the CLEAN list, I put it up for dismissal. If I do not do this task today, it must be dismissed the next time I visit my CLEAN list.<br><br>It occurred to me that what I am doing is really GTD without the weekly review, lack of decision-making on what to do next, and the lack of rules for getting tasks that you aren't likely to do soon out of the way in an orderly fashion. <br><br>If I did not have quite a large number of potential tasks and ideas that cluttered up my AF2 main list, I would not need to use this approach. I do have a lot of them, however! I do not think of my associated lists in terms of contexts, although there are a few context lists. It's organized more in terms of activities I am likely to do at the same time. When I clean, I like to keep cleaning. I don't typically want to do one little cleaning task and move on to something else. Likewise when I blog, I tend to write several posts. It makes sense for me to group them together.<br><br>The other rule I use is that I do not add time-sensitive tasks to the associated lists. I add these to the main list. So if I have company coming over tomorrow and my toilets HAVE to be cleaned, I will add that to my main list. Then I never have to stress out about reviewing the associated lists for time-sensitive tasks. They are there for my information and benefit, but not as my lifeline. I think this approach could be quite useful for those of you with urgent tasks. Shorten your main list by having associated lists and add your time-sensitive tasks to this neat and tidy main list.<br><br>The side benefit of all of this (I realize it may seem too complicated for many of you) is that I can easily see how balanced my life is. Since my main list is mostly comprised of my primary activities (clean, organize, exercise, read, write, etc.), I can see which are being neglected. Certainly this approach could be made too complex with an associated list for every little thing, but I limit it to the biggies. I also include on my main list to work on associated lists for long-term deadlined projects (DoThisFirst on the IPhone) and goals/habits (Habit Factor on IPhone). <br><br>I keep all of my associated lists besides those just noted in Listomni on the iPhone so I can quickly go from the main list to the associated list. However, this system can be worked very efficiently on paper as any GTD guru will tell you. I have come to the place where I think Mark has provided the missing GTD link, especially for those with very large and complex lists. <br><br>I am interested to hear what others think. I've never been more at peace with my task management approach. This approach works even better for me with AF2 than AF1.</div>

<div class="content">This reminds me a bit of Tony Robbins' Time of Your Life system.<br><br>It was originally called OPA though he changed the name to RPM later, presumably because of the engine-revving images it conjures up.<br><br>OPA stands for Outcome, Purpose, Actions<br><br>Outcome = What you want to do<br>Purpose = Why you want to do it<br>Actions = What you need to do to achieve your outcome<br><br>This last step (Actions) can change from minute-to-minute and day-to-day depending on how your life is evolving however your Outcome and Purpose remain constant for that particular "OPA block".<br><br>In your example regarding cleaning, your outcome would be to "clean up house" (presumably) and your purpose would be...<insert juicy motivating reasons here to clean up your house>...and your actions are just a random list of brainstormed things you think you need to do to clean up your house...of which NOT all of them may need to be done to achieve your outcome.<br><br>Applying this to AF2 in an electronic approach, you would only need to list your Outcomes in the AF2 list, your purpose would be in the notes to that task and the actions would also be in there below your purpose.<br><br>When you notice the "clean house" task and you feel you want to do something towards it, you open up the task note and it reminds you why you want to do it.<br><br>From this state of mental clarity (do not underestimate the power of choosing from a focused mental state), choose the next task to work on for as long as you want.<br><br>The great benefit of OPA/RPM is that you drastically reduce the number of tasks on your task list while increasing your focus on where you are really heading.<br><br>As soon as you notice more single tasks on your task list that can be grouped together, you create a new OPA block for them as mentioned above.<br><br>It's a pretty nice approach...you are constantly putting your focus back on the level just above the "runway" level and thereby not continually getting lost in just doing tasks for the sake of doing tasks.<br><br>Hope some of that makes sense. :)</div>

<div class="content">Mel, somehow we have both come up with a similar system.<br><br>I was trying to use little and often with time blocking to do jobs each day. But I was either writing the same things over and over, or just feeling bogged down.I have a problem where if i don't write down my jobs I feel I am missing something, but if the list gets too big I start to procrastinate.<br><br>Now I just write down habits sheet and block sheet each day on my AF list. The habits sheet refers to a monthly sheet with a set of habits I try and do each day (get up early, go for a walk) and block sheet (again a monthly sheet with a tick for each area - cleaning, water garden, do food planning etc). The block sheet I am trying to work to a full 30mins block in each named item. I am using the technique Mark gave (in DIT?) of day 1 do 1 task (or part of), day 2 do 2 tasks (or part of) etc etc. So if I have a full day I can try and do a full 30mins in that area, if I am busy I will do just one thing.  But I love your new dismissal idea. Only counting a day as a day you work on that list. Someone else was struggling with only using their list on the weekend I think, that would suit them too!<br><br><br>I actually keep a lot of the block tasks on the AF list. So in the garden block I look through the AF list looking for garden tasks. I think if I was using my palm still I would filter, but it doesn't matter too much. I always have a tasks/AF/tickler block which is for usually house tasks (buy dishwasher, book plumber etc).<br><br>I think it shows how little actual time we spend doing unique things and most of it is day to day need to do activities that keep the wheels turning.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mel, Frank, and Amber,<br><br>Thanks for sharing your innovative approaches!  I am doing things somewhat similar in that I routinely add tasks to my AF2 list like "work on project X".  I know Mark and others have stated many times this is a good way to work with major projects.  I am finding this to be true for me and to have separate project lists.  This way, I can cycle through many projects and focus my attention on each one for as long as I want.<br><br>Mel, your combination of AF2 and GTD is very good!  I am making some modifications to my system per what you have described.  Very good, my man!<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">David, I'm so glad. I really hope it will make AF more workable for your busy life. Please give us an update on how things are going when it stands out. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Frank, thank you SO much for sharing this. I just started using the Habit Factor on my iPhone and the main thing I love about it is it asks for every goal/habit, "Why do you want to do this?" I have never looked at any of Tony Robbins' stuff, but I like this aspect a lot. I have added a comment to my main, repeating tasks as to why I'm doing them. I think this will be very helpful to me in easily dismissing (for tasks that have weak reasons) or just getting the most desirable things done. If it becomes too much clutter, I can always delete those comments but can still ask myself the question for each task up for dismissal.</div>
