<div class="content">Web browsing easily gets out of control   The problem is the new thing always seems important.  The solution is Autofocus: record that shiny new page to look at later, and stick to the current task.  You could write them on your list, but it's cumbersome writing the address out and later typing it back in.  Bookmarks could work, but it's too much having to manage bookmarks.<br><br>A better solution: I got the "Read It Later" plugin for Firefox.  Read It Later makes a good AF style list of pages to visit later.  And my master AF list only has "Read web" for idle reading.  <br><br>Now if I see a good link, I click on it, click "Read it Later", and stick to the previous page.  Then in Firefox I click "Read Something", see a list of things to read (oldest to newest), and process that list in AF fashion.  Pick a link, read it, "Mark as Read", and if I want to read it again, click "Read it Later", and the page goes to the end of the list!<br><br>(If you don't have or want that "Read It Later", my best suggestion for you is to Ctrl-Click on links.  That will make a new tab that you can get to another time.)</div>

<div class="content">Alan,<br><br>What irony.  I just remembered "Read it Later" and got the new version this morning!!!!<br><br>I used to do the CTL-<click> but I found that I wound up with too many tabs open and it seems to bog down FireFox.  Read it Later is a much better solution.  I found that they also have an iPhone app.</div>

<div class="content">Just did Get Add-ons on my FF 3.6, searching for "Read It Later". Found two similar apps ...<br>* https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/7661 - Read It Later 2.0.3<br>* https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/78241 - Read Later 0.1<br>... I believe you meant the first. I'm hopeful it'll help curb/direct my surfing. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">What I find when using it is just how non-essential a lot of that saved to-read stuff is. By clicking the page to be read later, I satisfy that pesky novelty-circuit in my brain (I've seen something new), and I "promise" that part that I'll read it later. But I hardly ever get to it (actually, never, so far). Read It Later does its job by sweeping those distracting pages out of my way and parking them somewhere so I can go back "just in case." Even if "the case" never arrives, it somehow quiets that compulsing part of me, so I'm very grateful for that extension.</div>

<div class="content">I'll try it.  Sounds like something I will like for reasons similar to Mike Brown.<br><br>It was interesting that the comments were fairly evenly divide between people who love it and those who hate it.</div>

<div class="content">Alan,<br><br>Thanks for this, excellent timing!<br><br>I've just downloaded the Chrome version and it's saved this thread.<br><br>Like you, I can now put Read web as a task, maybe put it in my Daily Routine for after-hours, whatever.<br><br>This what's great about this forum, members submit suggestions for helping all of us to get a little bit more productive than before, because members know what we are all trying to do, broadly speaking.</div>

<div class="content">I do something similar, but save web archives of things I want to read to Together, my notebook application.  It's a simple drag of the favicon to the tab and then it's there, locally, for me to look at later.</div>
