<div class="content">Mark<br><br>I'm asking this in a spirit of genuine interest, having been a keen user of AF since the start and now planning to try out AF2. However in AF2 the closed list concept virtually disappears, which led me to wonder about the journey you have made since DIT. On the front page of this website you still say about To Do lists: "A to do list is the finest known way of ensuring that you never get to the end of your work. The proof? How often have you ended the day with more items on your to do list than you started it with? Me, I finish all my work, just about every day. And I can teach you to do the same.". I wonder what you would say about this now? The process of dismissal keeps the list under control, but nevertheless it is still a list that at the end of each day is likely to have many undone items on it. So how would you put the key advantage of AF2 over the traditional to-do list? <br><br>Isaac</div>

<div class="content">Hi isaac<br>Holy Crikey!!!  I NEVER looked at Mark's homepage before!  When I read his METHODS I DON'T RECOMMEND!, I had to blush!  Although I rarely need to prioitize by Urgency, I prioritize by importance daily!  BTW, I wouldn't forget the wing mirros because that would be covered in the plan........<br><br>Mark, I apologize.  I won't write about what you don't recommend anymore.  I honestly didn't know because I never saw your homepage.  It was in DIT but I only used DIT to improve my existing system...<br>*blush*<br>learning as I go<br></div>

You can have sex in marriage, and you sex via a casual relationship. The action is the same. The rules are profoundly different. And hence, the outcome should be different as well.</div>

<div class="content">Isaac:<br><br>You're right - it's time I re-wrote my home page!<br><br>AF2 is a way of processing a to-do list that enables one to systematically work through it in a way that takes advantage of both urgency and importance, together with all other circumstances such as your own current mood and concentration.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Mark, that's very helpful. It seems to me that AF - both versions - overcome problems with DIT but at the cost of losing that focus on constructing a closed list of one day's work, and the sense of mental closure that brought. I wonder whether you could use the AF approach to construct a daily list from which to work, and how much would be lost in terms of flexible response to the daily flow of tasks? Just musing........</div>
