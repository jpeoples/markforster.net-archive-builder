<div class="content">Because the existential terror of the human condition permits me to, I want to comment on the following quote (<a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/626180):" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/626180):</a> <br><br>“Planning my work the night before appears to make a huge difference to me - I know if for some reason I can't plan the night before for whatever reason my day never goes as well. With Autofocus there is no plan - just a list of items to work through. I don't trust myself to make the right choices at that point.”<br><br>During my GTD times I sometimes experienced the same. The reason for this was a lack of trust in my environment at work, especially certain people.<br><br>Procrastination wasn’t the reason for not doing certain tasks, but lack of conflict management. After addressing and solving this problem several years ago I can now always do my planning at work and don’t have to wait until night and being at home to do the work that I should have done at the office.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Any tips on conflict management at work? This may be a problem for me.</div>

<div class="content">Actually I realise that I have started to plan at work but I keep this planning hidden because of what particular colleagues would say.  The planning has helped me greatly.  It has really paid off.</div>

<div class="content">Planning the next day the night before has been a long time principle with me - I think it started after reading Napoleon Hill book, when I think it citied that one thing top producers had in common was this method of planning.<br><br>When I perform this sort of planning it covers all aspects of the day. As mentioned previously I utilise the Unschedule a 'Now Habit' principle.  So my planning is focussed around leisure first, then routine, then finally work. So it is a sort of reverse plan that is initially laid out on a weekly basis and updated on a daily basis.<br><br>I just find having a plan - is better than no plan. Partly because I also think it taps into the subconscious mind on a particular level. It gets you ready to face your day. As is the nature of things - it doesn't always go to plan but at least an attempt has been made and the plan for the following day can then be modified. To me knowing what I am going to do/or at least attempt to do the following day is half the battle.   <br><br>GTD didn't work for me; although it has a little more structure than Autofocus I got the same feeling.  The feeling of not being prepared.  It is a little like the old adage :- If you don’t know where you are going how do you know when you have arrived?  <br><br>Without a framework, structure, boundaries – some sort of plan you can struggle. Now some people may be able to quite happily overlay a large plan over they daily workload and intuitively know they are heading in the right direction. Or perhaps they are only concerned with roughly heading in the right direction. For others it is a case of we need to know we are heading true North and compensations need to be made often.  Our course is perhaps a little like sailing through dense fog.  We know where we are going as well, but we rely on our compass and not our intuition to steer is in the right direction. Ultimately we too would like to be able to use intuition but other problems seated in the realms of procrastination leave us untrusting.<br><br>Personally conflict management is not an issue for me - in fact it is not a term, I had until now, come across. Though I may have experienced it unknowingly on the GTD discussion groups :)<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Steve,<br><br>If you want to try a system that has a lot of structure, check out the book entitled "Instant Productivity Toolkit" by Len Merson.  It has 31+ very positive reviews on Amazon.<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">The one thing I would recommend to those who have this feeling that they can't work without a plan is to read the entire list through just before going to bed. When you wake up I think you will find that your mind has processed the day in your sleep and you are ready to get moving on it.</div>

<div class="content">Nice! I'm going to try the "read before sleep" thing. I often dream solutions to problems, so it would be fun to try to focus with AutoFocus.<br><br>ds</div>
