<div class="content">This is not specific to SuperFocus, but any AF type system.  There seems to be some that use the list to filter things, and some who filter things themselves and use the list mainly to do things.<br><br>What goes in your list?<br>A) Everything<br>B) Only Stuff I might do soon<br>C) Only Stuff I expect to do soon</div>

<div class="content">For me it is everything, I want a complete capture so I don't forget anything.</div>

<div class="content">A) Everything that comes to mind, as it comes to mind.</div>

<div class="content">A) Everything. That is one of the beauties of the systems. One big collection bucket, with no evaluation. Working the lists then allows the needed filtering to happen naturally.</div>

<div class="content">Everything.<br><br>But as soon as I determine that something on the list cannot be actioned yet, I try to get it off the list and into the appropriate place (e.g., rewrite as a "waiting for" or "follow up" item; move to  tickler for something to be started at a future date or time; etc.).</div>

<div class="content">A.  But with a qualification.  If there is something I want to do but I know I won't get to it for a long time, then it goes further through the notebook to turn up when my pages fill to that far.  For instance, I need to book an appointment to get my eyes checked, but I can't do that till I have a little money saved (ditto the dentist), so booking that appointment is on a page I will hopefully reach once another of my current 'tasks' - paying down some debt - will be achieved.</div>

<div class="content">I use it as a list of "wish for", "maybe", "don't forget". Yes, I know that's not the way it's supposed to be used.<br><br>Usually I have not many projects going on at once, but they are really big and I work on them for many months and only do just them (e.g. writing academic books which need lots of research before and lots of time spent writing at daily). My really big projects hardly ever go on the lists. It tires me having to keep rewriting them on and on for months.<br><br>But I imagine my case is quite unusual. I have one very clear, very fixed priority at a time, all the rest goes on the list, therefore it doesn't really matter much whether what's on the list gets done or not in the end. I keep it mostly for not-work related stuff.</div>

<div class="content">For me It's more B) than A).<br><br>Ad-hoc stuff won't go on the list as we discussed here already (play with kids, etc).<br>Stuff which stands out naturally also won't go on the list (dishes, etc.)<br>And stuff which are somewhat urgent (leave burning house ;-)</div>

<div class="content">A) with jens' qualifications. Everything that I think of to do/buy/think more about/research etc. that I will do at some other time than 'right now'. <br><br>I realized yesterday morning that I've always tended to think in lists. I find myself  'chanting' them in my head and deleting items as I finish. I think this becomes more important as I get older. ;) I also do best at remembering things when I associate like items. <br>Going to the kitchen: refill coffee, fill dogs' water bowl, take vitamin. <br>Going to the other half of the house: grab hat/jacket, put on makeup, brush teeth, put on jewelry. <br><br>I realized yesterday that these are little, internal, mini-C2s that get cycled through (hopefully) almost automatically.</div>

<div class="content">A, unless it's a task I know I need to do after a particular time in the future (the spring gardening work, for example).  Those tasks go as reminders in my calendar.  Unless I'm in a big hurry and don't feel like messing with the calendar in which case I will put them in my list as, for example, Calendar for May 1st: Spring gardening work.</div>
