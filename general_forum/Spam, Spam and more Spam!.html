<div class="content">Hi All<br><br>I've extracted the comments from the [][][][][] Spam thread below so that they don't get deleted when Mark clears the spam.  Can I suggest that we don't add any more comments to Spam threads as I will have no idea how to reference them when updating the FAQ's ..... :-)  Thanks everyone!<br><br>..............................................................................................................<br><br><br><br><br>How does this person manage to spam this forum???<br><br>..........................................................March 27, 2009 at 2:39 | Charles <br><br><br><br>Are you suggesting that we are worse off for a Barbie pink site flooding the world with pretty false nails from a secret hideaway somewhere in the Ukraine?<br><br>On the face of it, spamming this audience with illegible messages is not a winning strategy for Klopot's Nail Emporium.<br><br>But again...<br><br>Perhaps Jacqueline's team would appreciate the product after smashing their own nails on their keyboards entering the same accounting data three times?<br><br>And, thinking about it, after the sheer volume of their typing on this site, perhaps we owe Jacqueline and Christine B some repairs?<br><br>But (again), it would be morally wrong to reward spammers for their inept villainy...<br><br>Oh dear: this wasn't on my task list...<br> <br>.......................................................March 27, 2009 at 11:09 | Will <br><br><br><br><br>I think it's a great testimony to the power of Autofocus that even the spammers come here to learn about it! I suppose it helps them become better spammers. ;) <br><br>.................................................March 27, 2009 at 16:35 | Seraphim <br><br><br><br><br>Something tells me Mark F. is off enjoying some quality time with his daughter. Good for him, and unfortunately good for spammers.<br><br>I can't help it that I type fast Will - and have lots of questions! :-) Christine has answers, I just have problems. At least our methods are totally different so there's two opposing viewpoints!<br><br>I wonder if they entered spamming the site as a recurring task... <br><br>....................................................March 28, 2009 at 12:30 | Jacqueline <br><br><br><br><br>Oooh Jacqueline - don't give me too much credit! I have lots of problems! :-) Not least of which being the fact that I am now on page 64 and have already added 72 items today! BUT - the first stage of my project is finished! I expect to add lots more items today and then from tomorrow they should diminish rapidly! Wheeeee! <br><br>...................................................March 28, 2009 at 13:12 | Christine B <br><br><br><br><br>You're beating me then Chirstine, I added 3 and finished 6 and it's not even noon. Did 2 loads of laundry and walked the dog for almost 2 hours both off list too. And I think I found my hardwood flooring nailer on kijiji - who knew getting a used nailer could be so... *hard*??? :-)<br><br>....................................................March 28, 2009 at 17:26 | Jacqueline <br><br><br><br><br>Only just beating you ...... :-)<br><br>And I just looked up kijiji so I now know what that is! Hmmm - I have laundry on my list and haven't done it yet :-( <br><br>....................................................March 28, 2009 at 18:09 | Christine B <br><br><br><br><br>Just give away most of your clothes on kijiji / freecycle and you'll be forced to do your laundry regularly. :-) <br><br>...................................................March 28, 2009 at 19:44 | Jacqueline <br><br><br><br><br>Now there's an idea :-) <br>...................................................March 28, 2009 at 22:39 | Christine B <br><br><br><br>This method also works for losing weight too - after I had my first baby, I was 40 pounds overweight, but never let myself buy new clothes - couldn't have afforded to anyway as I was going to university. But having to wear the same leggings every day was motivation to fit into my old clothes, that's for sure! :-) <br><br>...................................................March 29, 2009 at 3:22 | Jacqueline</div>
