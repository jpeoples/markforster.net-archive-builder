<div class="content">Hi Everyone, I would be really interested to see examples of the recurring daily tasks that people use on their lists, as people sometimes refer to useful sounding recurring tasks that wouldn't normally occur to me to list. <br><br>I'll give some examples of my own to get the ball rolling, though it is from my office job, which I track using a separate notebook from my personal list (I carry both with me - it works for me!)  <br><br>Breaks 40/10 (20 mid am/pm) <br>Check diary/appts today and forthcoming (also my wife's calendar), set reminders if needed <br>Identify key objectives for day <br>Review any outstanding meeting actions - action or add to list <br>Clear Today emails <br>Check yesterday's sent mails, schedule any outstanding follow-ups <br>Thinking time [jot ideas on issue of current interest] <br>Review day, key achievements, choices made <br>[I used to have tidy desk, but I don't seem to need that at the moment...] <br><br>Thanks everyone!  Really appreciate the posts here.</div>

<div class="content">The only thing that I regularly put on my (no-)list is "calendar/reminders". That's enough to check my calendar, review upcoming meetings, get ready to capture meeting minutes, and any other needed preparations. It also prompts me to check Outlook reminders for any other time-sensitive things that should go onto my list for the day.<br><br>I also have some time blocked at end of day that's intended for clearing any outstanding emails and general cleanup. That hasn't been working especially well -- I tend to resist timeblocks. So I am thinking of converting it into an afternoon reminder. When the reminder pops up, I will write the EOD tasks on my list. I don't want to think about these things till end of the day -- if I fuss over them DURING the day, they just take up way too much time.<br><br>There are a few other recurring things that pop up from time to time, but they don't reside permanently on the list (since it's a no-list, and they don't always come to mind every day) - <br>-- go for a walk<br>-- take a break<br>-- clear the desk<br>-- empty the trash<br><br>etc.</div>

<div class="content">I work at home, so housework is spread throughout the day. A bit of time in each room is part of the daily routine. When I try to do an entire room each day, I fall behind and then have to go back to the important rooms before the less important ones get any attention. It's amazing what 5 minutes a day in each room will do. (15 each in kitchen and laundry room.) It's also more flexible.<br><br>I don't get outside enough, so that's on the list. Email triage morning and evening. (Triage = Catch the very few things that need attention within the hour. Then deal with the rest. Toss immediately, read quickly and toss, flag for attention Today, Next few days, Next few weeks.) Plus Daily planning. Daily review (including writing why I didn't do what I'd planned).<br><br>Every few days, more email. (Usually 2-3 hours a week for email. Email for a big project counts under project time, not email.) Also tidy desk and LAO projects that don't get daily attention. Look ahead/behind on calendar and daily plan book. Plan next few days if they look busy.<br><br>Every few weeks look ahead / behind on calendar. Plan next few weeks if they look busy.</div>
