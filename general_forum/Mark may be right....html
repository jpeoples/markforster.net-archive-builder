<div class="content">It would seem that the less I use autofocus, the less effective it is. When AF4 came out, I used it willy nilly with poor results. For the past couple of weeks, I've tried using it for at least one hour a day. The results are much better. When I do tasks outside of AF, the internal mechanisms of intuition & pressure are dulled when I return to AF. There's this little voice in my head going: "Eh, you don't need to do any of these items now because you can always do them later... when you're not using autofocus". <br><br>Perhaps Mark's approach is best - AF all day, all night.</div>

<div class="content">I agree with you in theory.  My problem is that I have definite workaholic tendencies, and if I spend  too much time using AF4 (or 3 or 2 or 1) I find I become a non-stop work machine, and I don't like that feeling.  <br>It's one reason I prefer DIT.</div>

<div class="content">Guys, you may want to look at a post I started yesterday which is looking at AF4 and DIT where some of us are using both to deal with the need to prioritise certain items e.g. time driven and a weekly review but are getting benefit from using AF4 for all other aspects. It's only a short post. I pick out the three or four must or need to dos and work on them and then work AF rest of time, be interested to see what you think.<br><br>Best <br><br>-titch</div>

<div class="content">Steve,<br><br>If you'll notice how Mark does it, he puts his "play" on his AF list as well and so when he needs a break he picks a movie to watch, or a book to read, or TV to watch.  If you include all of the things you do for work and play on the list then you can do it 24/7 (assuming you also put "sleep" on your list ;-) and not be a workaholic.</div>

<div class="content">Putting 'play' or anything else that's a routine to-do is the hardest part of AF (any version) for me to do. it's a bigger mind-shift than I expected it to be  - but years of using systems with "only put things you'll forget to do" rules is a hard habit to break LOL</div>

<div class="content">My current todo list is essentially a list of obligations. I manage and review this list using AF, but I am starting to realize that the list in AF is not just for obligations. Rather, the list is more of a "life script" that you follow throughout the day every day, that guides each decision you make. This is a fairly intense idea. I will try to put into practice and see how it goes.</div>

<div class="content">Tony - "life script" - that's an excellent way to put it. Hell of a lot better than the scripts that are usually going on inside my head.</div>

<div class="content">Yes Tony, AF4 as a life script is a good idea.</div>
