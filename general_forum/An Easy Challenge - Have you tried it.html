<div class="content">I'd be curious to know if anyone has attempted this exercise Mark posted before DIT came out. If you have tried it, what was your experience with it?<br><br><a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/easy-challenge/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/easy-challenge/</a></div>

<div class="content">It is interesting that this relic of a post is still on the site, without a specific date or any place for reader comments.  How did you find it?<br><br>It's also interesting that the focus was on completing tasks (as phrased), not just making incremental progress a la "little and often."<br><br>I try to 'score' three points each day, by marking the 'Big 3' tasks on my list.  #1 is some sort of physical exercise in the morning, and is easily finished, once started.  #2 and #3 are work-related which I try to take action on before noon.  But now I realize that I often give myself too much credit on #2 or #3, by allowing any small action to count as a point.  I should phrase any such important task specifically, so that it may be scored meaningfully as done or not.</div>

<div class="content">Ubi,<br><br>Thanks for sharing. I have sometimes found the three-MIT approach helpful as well.<br><br>I found the article under the Archives tab, but I believe the Articles tab would also find it if you went back far enough. It I one of several articles from Mark's old newsletter that he republished here as articles in the early days of the site.<br><br>I do not think defining tasks such that they have a definite completion is inconsistent with little and often. Little and often can be achieved by further breakdown of tasks while still always phrasing sub-tasks such that they have a clear completion criteria.</div>

<div class="content">ubi:<br><br>It's interesting that you use the method as "the 3-MIT approach" with a static target of three points, rather than the way the article envisaged of increasing the number of points scored each day.<br><br>I guess you could claim that the task "Do some work on Project X" is fulfilled by doing any small action, but the idea was really to define a precise target (however small) and only count the point if you achieved it.<br><br>The article was later incorporated into my book "Do It Tomorrow" (pp. 41-42 in the print edition) as an exercise intended to help us to realize how little we write our to do lists for the day in the expectation of finishing them.</div>
