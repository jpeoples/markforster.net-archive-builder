<div class="content">I've been experimenting with this:<br><br>1. Cycle through the last two pages of your Long List as long as you want, working on whatever stands out. Basically this is Simple Scanning, treating the last two pages as if they were your whole list. ( <a href="../blog/Simple Scanning - The Rules.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2017/12/2/simple-scanning-the-rules.html</a> )<br> <br>2. When nothing stands out, cycle back to your first active page, and switch to Randomizer ( <a href="../blog/Random Time Management.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2014/1/22/random-time-management.html</a> ). <br><br>3. Eventually Randomizer will land you on the penultimate active page. When that happens, go back to (1.)<br> <br>4. If at any time you have a new urgent task, you may write it on the last page and jump to it immediately. When you are done with that task, just go back to (1.)<br><br><br>Why:<br>- Allows me to think and focus on the stuff that is active and moving.<br>- Allows me to eliminate decision fatigue and resistance on all the older stuff, so I can clean it out more quickly, and give my mind a bit of a rest.<br>- The random selection of the older tasks is enough to give me an intuition for the list as a whole, without the need to scan through every item. I can then use that intuition as I work through the last two pages.<br>- The last two pages work more like a thinking tool than a time management tool. <br>- This approach also seems to help keep the list short.<br>- It's fun to experiment. :-)</div>

<div class="content">I will play with this also. I've recently taken on more responsibilities since we joined a cohousing community, and the last page is filling up quickly, esp with postponed holiday-related tasks. I find myself hanging around that last page or two due to the urgency of some of these items.<br><br>But I still want to make progress on old stuff. I used randomizer at the start of my list this weekend and it felt great to knock off some older tasks and just nudge the ball along. The old stuff provides some novelty/variety in amidst the day-to-day, and it felt good to be reminded of them.</div>

<div class="content">I'm trying a new variant of this, which I like even more:<br><br>1. Cycle through your list, following Simple Scanning rules ( <a href="../blog/Simple Scanning - The Rules.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2017/12/2/simple-scanning-the-rules.html</a> )<br> <br>2. If nothing stands out for action on the first active Simple Scanning page, mark the page with a large "R". This now becomes the first page of your Randomizer pages. <br><br>3. Eventually, this results is a number of pages at the beginning of your list that are marked as Randomizer pages, followed by a number of pages that are unmarked and treated as Simple Scanning pages.<br><br>4. While working the Simple Scanning pages, just go through in order as per the usual Simple Scanning rules. <br><br>5. When you come to the end of the list, you cycle back to the beginning of the Randomizer pages, and switch to Randomizer rules. ( <a href="../blog/Random Time Management.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2014/1/22/random-time-management.html</a> ). <br><br>6. Eventually Randomizer will land you on the first active Simple Scanning page. When that happens, go back to (4.)<br> <br>7. If at any time you have a new urgent task, you may write it on the last page and jump to it immediately. When you are done with that task, just go back to (4.)<br><br><br>This seems to work as a kind of "dismissal", but with a very specific method of processing the "dismissed" pages -- i.e., process them with Randomizer.<br><br>I suppose this same method could be combined with almost any Long List system, such as AF1, as long as you keep the Randomizer pages as a block that precedes the other standard pages.</div>

<div class="content">I have been using a hybrid AF2 and Randomizer system<br>1. Start off with AF2, going backwards to the list until reaching the top<br>2. Use randeomizer back down the list, once you get taken past the end of the list, go back to AF2<br><br>I also have a variant of randomizer, whereby I can chose to do the item the randomiser falls on, the one before it, or the one after it. The next random selection always starts at the item I actually worked on.</div>

<div class="meta">2018-12-13 20:56</div>
<div class="content">Huh, I actually thought of doing this a couple of weeks ago, but difference is using AF2 for tasks up to the day before, then Randomizer for everything older.  This is because I realized it was dividing tasks by closing the list at the end of each day, and not any artificial dividing scheme like pages, that maximizes the use of "clumping".  And up to only the day before is to maximize the doing of daily habits.<br><br>But then I found that FFVP is working very well for me so I never did try it.<br><br>Good luck on your systems, guys!</div>

<div class="content">I think I'm having similar success but without randomizing.  Back when Seraphim was writing on "How reducing resistance for individual tasks causes WIP and misalignment to increase" I posted a suggested solution:<br><br><a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2725530#post2726070" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2725530#post2726070</a><br><br>I've actually been following this idea for the past month and it works fine.  I have two lists which you might call Sooner and Later, and I focus mostly on Sooner stuff, sometimes dip into the Later stuff, and after I work on something I decide whether i want to work on it again sooner or later, and move the item accordingly.  <br><br>But the effect is I have a short list that I focus on that consists of things I might work on Sooner, and don't get distracted by things I intend to do Later.  Which is similar to this Random old pages thing without the randomizing.<br><br>The only thing extra, is I find it valuable to mark dates so I can see when old items get stuck and sense progress when old dates get consumed.  It's a hint if I need to clean up the list.<br><br>(Defining these terms: I don't have a formal rule, just a feeling.  'Sooner' applies to things I may want to do today, or definitely don't want to forget about though in fact it might be left for many days.  'Later' applies to things I don't need to today, and getting to them sometime anytime will be fine.  I tend not to let things sit for more than a month or so, after a certain point, they oughta be deleted, advanced, or set aside for a calendar.)</div>

<div class="content">Here the rules I am using right now. It's been fun and seems to generate some of the same "Clumping, Attenuation, and Maturity" that Simple Scanning does. <br><br>cf. <a href="../blog/Simple Scanning - Clumping, Attenuation and Maturity.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2017/12/13/simple-scanning-clumping-attenuation-and-maturity.html</a><br><br>1. Start with basic Randomizer-With-Sliding rules: <a href="../blog/Random Time Management.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2014/1/22/random-time-management.html</a><br><br>2. If you are on the last page, keep cycling around the last page until, by adding tasks to it and eventually starting a new page, it is no longer the last page. <br><br>3. If I land on a task that cannot be actioned now, leave the task on the list where it is, without crossing it off; AND also re-enter the task at the end of the list. (For example, I am at work and it must be done at home; or, a person I need isn't available)<br><br>4. Rule 3 can cause you to be trapped on a page. So if you activate Rule 3, three times in succession, then just automatically go to the next page.<br><br><br>I'm also playing around with different ways to timebox things. But I am continuing to refine this. Basically I try to use small timeboxes on the older pages, not allowing myself to spend more than 5-10 minutes on a task. On the last page, I use a larger timebox. This was originally inspired by a comment by Ronda Bowen on the original Randomizer rules blog post. <br><br><a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2014/1/22/random-time-management.html?currentPage=2#comment20765568" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2014/1/22/random-time-management.html?currentPage=2#comment20765568</a><br><br>I am finding that all of this gives me so much speed and eliminates resistance that I don't need to use Standing Out at all. But nonetheless these rules still engage my intuition in a surprising way.</div>

<div class="content">Looks like I'll give it a whirl. Quick question: on the last page when you start simple scanning, I assume that if no task stands out even if it's not a full page, you just start the randomizer from page 1?</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, I'll start today. I've tried other modifications to the Randomizer system as well because for me, straight randomizer doesn't handle tasks with deadlines very well. For example, I would sometimes use the randomizer method to pick a task and then ask what I wanted to do before I did that. The problem for me was that this tended to dilute the power of the randomizer against resistance. I think your idea will keep resistance at bay while allowing me to work on items that have a close due date. I'll let you know how it works.</div>

<div class="content">Some methods for keeping big projects moving while using Randomizer:<br><br>1. Alternate, or time of day, limits what items you can choose. It's easiest if you separate the list somehow or use margin codes, so you only count the ones you can do now. Or you can count all the lines, and then slide down to the first you can do now. I don't like that one, though, because if you have a long cluster of not-now, you'll often end up doing the first "allowed" one after the cluster, which means it's not random.<br><br>2. Decision tree. Roll to determine which project (or group or projects). Roll again to decide what within that group. This works well if you know what needs to be done. Eg 1st roll: Housework. 2nd roll: bedroom. No need to check the list or roll more, since bedroom always starts with a general tidying. If I've already done that, then do the drawer that stands out or roll. No need to list, just start at the door, turn left and count, ignoring the ones that don't need work. (Maybe pre-count, so the 7th drawer has a chance. Really messy drawers can be mentally divided, so they count as 2.) If the 1st roll is desk, then several more rolls for project and part of project.<br><br>You can also weight the roll, so you're more likely to choose certain paths, or not count any path you've already taken recently.<br><br>I enjoyed setting up the tree, but only used it a few times.</div>

<div class="content">One thing I struggle with is using Paper or Electronic (OneNote) with Randomizer. I like both and can never decide which I like better. But I found a simple solution that has been working pretty well. I just include a task on each list, to switch to the other list. I really wasn’t expecting it to work so well, but it’s been great. I just enter stuff on whatever list is most convenient.</div>

<div class="content">OK fine I'm joining the Randomizer bandwagon, especially after reading Seraphim's Dec. 22 post!  I really like the idea of using Randomizer to emulate the "Clumping, Attenuation, and Maturity" effect of long lists, but after my own experimentations over the last month I am fully convinced that to maximize these effects you have to divide your list into days you wrote them in, not pages.  Therefore I have been using this process:<br><br><br>1. Every morning, using a pencil, close the day before with a short stubble at the right side, then close the day before this by extending the previous stubble to the other end, and then erase the line the day previous to this.<br><br>(If you want to try this right now with your list without waiting for the next day, just examine the list and try to determine the first task you crossed out yesterday, then draw the long line above it.  Alternatively, determine what is the highest task positionally in your list that you want to do sometime today, then draw the long line above this.)<br><br>2. Examine your list below the drawn line (from here on to be called the Urgent List, and the list above the line will be called the Provisional List) and then decide for yourself: How often do you want to work on your Urgent List compared to your Provisional List today? Three-fourths of your time? Two-thirds? Half? Express this in mathematical fractions as it will be important for the next steps.<br><br>3. The processing of the list is done by drawing a random number two times.  The first number is to determine which list you will work on, the Provisional List or the Urgent List, and the second random number will be used on the Randomizer process itself.  For the first part to work, you will have to divide the number of lines you have per page by the fraction you decided in the step before.  For example, my small notebook has 38 lines per "page" (two actual pages facing each other).  If I wanted to do the Urgent List 2/3 of the time today, then one-third of 38 is 12.67.  Therefore, if the first random number generated is 12 and below, I will work on the Provisional List, but if it is 13 and above I will work on the Urgent List.  Just to remind me of this, I write, using a pencil, "12" above the line and "13" below the line.  <br><br>4.  Once all of the above is done, draw the first random number, with 1 the smallest possible number and the number of lines in a page the largest.  This will decide whether you will work on the Provisional List or the Urgent List per the criteria you decided in the above step.<br><br>5.  Once you know which list you are going to work on, draw the second random number and do the Randomizer process ( <a href="../blog/Random Time Management.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2014/1/22/random-time-management.html</a> ).  Remember to use a heavy dot before the item chosen.  <br><br>6. To account for the possibility Seraphim has noted above: If you land on a task you cannot do right now, use the sliding method as described in the instructions of Randomizer.<br><br>7.  After doing the task, cross out the task and rewrite at the end of the list if needed, but do NOT cross out the heavy dot, as that will be your marker for where to start counting again later.  You have to of course cross the heavy dot once you start counting again from that position.  Go back now to Step 4 to continue.<br><br><br>I have been using this thing only since yesterday, but it has been fun, and it also does seem to emulate the "Clumping, Attenuation, and Maturity" of long lists too, especially if you give a significantly longer time to processing the Urgent List compared to the Provisional List. Time will tell though if it will stay that way!</div>

<div class="content">nuntym, your idea of drawing the lines like that gave me another idea, with which I am experimenting.<br><br>Basically it’s DIT, cycling between today’s page and anything leftover from yesterday, doing whatever stands out. If nothing stands out, use Randomizer to clear out any previous pages.</div>

<div class="content">Step 3, deciding which list to work on, doesn't have to be that complicated.<br><br>If I want to work on List A 1/3 of the time, then a 1 or 2 on the 1st die is list A, and 3,4,5 or 6 is list B. No need to count lines and divide for that step.<br><br>For the next step, choosing a line on a list, count the active lines, then if you roll higher than you have lines, roll again. That gives truly random. If you continue counting at the top of the list, it gives the first lines more weight. (I prefer this over counting finished lines and sliding. Sliding gives more weight to lines after long crossed-out clumps. Personal preference.)<br><br>Also, 2d6 (gamer notation for rolling 2 6-sided dice) gives numbers around 7 much, much more than 2 or 12.<br><br>( While I'm on it, have you seen the variety of dice you can get? Gamers regularly use 2 (a coin), 4, 6, 8,10, 12 and 20-siders. 100-sided exist, but usually we use 2 marked 10s. You can get a full set for a few dollars, and pretty and/or collectible ones for much, much more. Even though most of us now have apps that roll just as well, they're not nearly as satisfying as rolling 4d6 (6-sider 4 times) for damage. )</div>

<div class="content">Some observations now that I've been running these experiments for a couple weeks:<br><br>(1) The speed of randomizer prompts me to add more small things to the list -- causing the list to grow faster than I can get it done. Previously I would have just tried to get those smaller things done immediately, or relied on the fact that most of them come back by themselves without any prompting. But while working in Randomizer mode, I feel compelled to keep going with my list, and don't want to just take things as they come. So more stuff goes onto the list, and eventually even Randomizer's speed can't keep up.<br><br>(2) I am feeling more out of touch with the list as a whole -- and this interferes substantially with the Simple Scanning on the last pages. The "standing out" doesn't work as well. I think this derives the fact that I am not constantly scanning the older pages and keeping their contents fresh in my mind, as I would be doing with ordinary Simple Scanning. For older pages, this isn't a problem as most of those tasks can either wait longer, or be deleted. For younger pages, it's more of a problem because those tasks are more fresh and alive but I am not able to keep them fresh in my mind. I know there is stuff lurking there, and this creates a sense of anxiety that interferes with Standing Out. All of this is exacerbated by (1).<br><br><br>I'm not sure how to address these dynamics effectively. I suppose it might be better to stick with Simple Scanning but if I am feeling tired or just need a kickstart, I can switch to Randomizer for a bit. Perhaps Randomizer is better as a situational tool rather than an overall system.<br><br>Those of you who have been experimenting along with me here -- how has it been working for you?</div>

<div class="content">I went back to experimenting with my homebrew "improved" AF2.  The Randomizer system I was using was starting to break down, as tasks that I would have worked on in the past two days were not being done on in the timeframe I wanted and thus were being placed in the "Provisional List", and it certainly was not as "responsive" as the other long-list systems were. Both I think are inherent problems of random systems.<br><br>@Seraphim:  The problem with #2 may be that the borders between SS and Randomizer in your list keeps on changing.  Not only that, but the "Clumping, Attenuation, and Maturity" effects may start to break down because random things are being done together.  At least, that's what I think; problems like these are some of the reasons why I didn't add any "standing out" procedures in the system I thought of.</div>
<h2>Reply by Seraphim</h2>
<div class="meta">2018-12-29 23:41</div>
<div class="content">The "Clumping, Attenuation, and Maturity" seemed to happen like this:<br>1. An item on the last pages "stands out" and I work on it. Or, an item is randomly selected, and I work on it.<br>2. That item (and the larger outcomes it supports) builds momentum.<br>3. When randomizer selects other tasks, if they happen to be related to this momentum, they generally get plenty of attention and help build the momentum.<br>4. If they are unrelated to the current momentum, it might become clear that they are not needed at all. In which case they are just deleted. Or they receive minimal attention.<br><br>I think this is related to that "negative standing out" phenomenon we discussed somewhere, earlier this year. Randomizer is not really completely random. The *selection* is random, but how much you follow through on the selected task, and whether it gets deleted, have a lot to do with your larger context and whatever tasks happen to be getting momentum.<br><br>But it breaks break down when many unrelated things are selected. Any sense of momentum is lost. Likewise, visibility for the list as a whole is lost. So the intuitive sense of the whole context of one's work is diluted. This negatively impacts the standing out process on the last pages.</div>
