<div class="content">Do you start back at page 1 or do you just pick up where you left off? Example: I have 4 pages of tasks and I made it through 3 (nothing has been dismissed yet)</div>

<div class="content">In my understanding of the system, it wouldn't make much of a difference where you start on day 2, as long as you go through all you consecutive pages.  <br>At least here, I have noticed that I cycle through all my pages several times a day, so if I start on the first page that still has items on it, or on the first page that I wrote today, or on the last page that I was working from yesterday, that won't make a difference, as every page will come to my attention a few times today.</div>

<div class="content">Joe:<br><br>When you start at the beginning of the day (or any other break), you start where you left off.<br><br>But if you had four pages of tasks and only made it to page three, I'm a bit worried that you aren't doing it properly. Are you sure you are following the instructions exactly? As Anne says it is normal to cycle through the pages several times in a day.</div>

<div class="content">Well, I do believe I'm doing it properly. Scanning  the page quickly, then slowly until I find something that stands out, correct? I think part of the slow progress through the pages is I had a big project that needed to be completed which took about 5 hours.</div>

<div class="content">Joe:<br><br>Don't forget that Autofocus encourages a "little and often" approach, so it might be more effective to work on a big project like that for a shorter period and then re-enter it. I appreciate though that the time-scale on this occasion may have prevented that approach.</div>

<div class="content">I've just read the instructions, and that is my major worry: I normally have a number of big tasks to do - and normally i don't do many of them on the day. Thus, it might be that I do not circle through all the pages within a day - it may need a couple of days. In particular, it often requires some lead time to start a task (load some files, load some tools identify where to continue, etc.). I wonder if anybody has a problems with this "change of mental and project context" taking place very often a day.<br>Wolfgang</div>

<div class="content">Wolfgang:<br><br>Actually, your post made me think about the time overheads involved in switching tasks when I was using the time-burst technique in DIT to get through a large volume of tasks. In AF, this has virtually disappeared for me because of the little and often approach it cleverly weaves into the system. For eg, a project may involve getting the files and software ready to tackle it (the time overhead), so that is all I do, before crossing it out and putting it at the end of the list.<br><br>When I reach the end, it seems like a fresh start, and I feel amazingly motivated to get started on the project. Now, you will note, that overhead has not disappeared, but simply broken up. And the next pass will get you to a running start on it.<br><br>With time bursts, I used to get frustrated with the artificial time cut off, when I really wanted to spend a bit more time on a task, or some times less.<br><br>I have virtually given up using any sort of timer, and now let my own rhythm dictate the time I dictate on a project or task. And AF has worked well under several heavy work load volumes coming at me in an unexpected way last week.<br><br>Not sure if my post helps you in any way on your projects, but I think if you allow the mental context switching to be a single item you do to kick start your project, I think you may find that you are mentally geared to start work on it on the next pass. Not to mention the fact that you will be quickly knocking off a few low level items if you are eager to get to it at the end, further preparing you to concentrate on the project as some smaller mosquito tasks may have been done along the way.</div>

<div class="content">JD your post echos my experience of AF. I have several large work projects and I had procrastinated over them terribly to the extent that i had missed deadlines etc. I started using DIT and found it helped but now on reflection see that the time burst aspect did not sit me either. The ability that you get with AF to effectively be rewarded for even taking a small step on a task - crossing an item off the list - gives you a sense of achievement and when you get round to the (re-entered) item standing out again you approach it fresh as a progression on from an achievement on that project already.<br><br>I do place essential deadlines into my calendar schedule as a back up to ensure that I can manage time critical elements, but reading some of the posts on projects I may look at trialing including the deadlines in AF in the next couple of weeks too.</div>

<div class="content">That is also what I have found - the "permission" to do just a small amount removes that feeling of "impending doom" which seemed to hang around certain projects, and which usually came from the belief that I needed to spend 5 hours/months/days on a task in one intensive burst.<br><br>What I am finding is, that by using the "little and often" approach wherever possible, things are getting progressed and getting progressed well.  In fact the amount I achieve in a "little" time is probably equal to or greater than I would have achieved in a pre-AF stressed state in a much longer period.<br><br>Consequently, in a normal workday period of time I am now achieving far more than I probably would have done in several.</div>
