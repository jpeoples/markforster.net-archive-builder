<div class="content">I need some advice with DWM on how to handle tasks that occur daily, multiple times daily (clear inbox), and those that may be every other day or every 3rd or 4th day.  <br><br>Thanks ahead of time.</div>

<div class="content">Some recurring tasks, I re-add on the +7 page, some I re-add on the +30 page. I think the main difference is whether I think of the task as completed for today or not. <br><br>For example - 'check email' isn't completed until I go home, so it gets re-added on +7 as a 'continuing task'. But 'update status' needs to be done twice a week, but it's done for today so it gets re-added on +30 as a 'new task' (with a due date of Thursday)</div>

<div class="content">I have repeating tasks set up in OmniFocus to handle this (that's all I use the program for now).  Some of them repeat every 4 hours, some every week, month, etc.  The Start Date feature keeps them hidden until it's actually time to do them.<br><br>(I actually use "start again 1 day after completion" type repeating, not "repeat every 1 day", since the latter shows up again even if you haven't finished the first occurrence)</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Lil for your comments, that's really helpful as it was an area I was struggling to deal with in DWM, everything else is working fine!<br><br>Best wishes<br><br>-Titch</div>

<div class="content">I have a checklist for recurring tasks. It has sections for daily, weekly, quarterly and annual items. In DWM I have only a recurring task called “Checklist”, which I roll forward so that I attend to it at least daily. Hope this helps.</div>

<div class="content">I find I just can't stand not to check my email several times a day. So I have "email" entered each day and put a checkmark next to the entry each time I look at email. That way I'm aware of spending time on it and don't go too overboard.<br><br>I also use checkmarks for a project that involves several steps that is time-sensitive and/or I expect to be finished it in a few days. That way I don't have to keep moving it ahead (MF says only one 7 day re-entry ((or is that just for monthly expires?)), and I've given myself credit by placing a checkmark next to it. By the time it's done I might have 2-3 checkmarks then cross it off. A little diversion from the system I suppose.<br><br>In fact, this might work better for me because I have so little time to "work the list", and I stay focused on a smaller area in the daily diary.</div>

<div class="content">I use an approach similar to Geoff.<br><br>In ListPro I have 3 tasks, Daily Routines, Weekly and Monthly.  Each has sub-tasks. <br><br>At the end of every day, for example, I note which sub-tasks have not been addressed, determine the reason if I can (spending too much time on this forum!?!), then un-check the done tasks and change the diary date to the next day.<br><br>Like Bev P, I mark the Check emails task as done the first time, then write it again in ink (the DWM list is printed every morning, 2 x A5 pages on one side of an A4 sheet, thus I get the best of both electronic and paper worlds) below the last item on the list (printed or written).</div>

<div class="content">If you print your list every morning, you must edit your e-list every evening, no?  Is this not tedious?</div>

<div class="content">Alan,<br><br>No, I don't find it tedious, it's a kind of a review at the same time, a think about today and a preview of tomorrow.<br><br>I check the completed/started items on the printout, ignore the additional handwritten tasks that were completed, add handwritten tasks that were not dealt with or which need further work..<br><br>The checked items on the printed list are 'cut' from the list and pasted into the DWM Done/Dismissed list in case I want to do a review of done/dismissed tasks some time in the future.<br><br>This electronic + paper approach in ListPro is working for me, I think, and maybe I'm getting towards the equilibrium you wrote about earlier, Alan, by striving never to exceed a list longer than 2 x A5 pages.<br><br>Time will tell</div>

<div class="content">I should have mentioned that each A5 page in ListPro has about 60 lines/tasks, I have about one-and-a-half of these pages (>100) on one side of the single A4 sheet.<br><br>This means I can add with my pen the additional tasks and still see everything on the one side of the A4 sheet.  The reverse side is used for jotting down snippets of info eg telephone numbers, new usernames/passwords (transferred into eWallet before I forget!), and yes, the sheet is shredded after I've updated at the end of the day.<br><br>I guess an incentive for me is to restrict DWM daily printed reports to two A5 pages!</div>

<div class="content">What about leaving the recurrent task in its place in DWM and not crossing it off even though you worked on it? Is that a workable system for recurrent tasks?</div>

<div class="content">Mark T - No, that wouldn't work.  The task would eventually fall off the list (dismissed).  <br><br>With DWM, I normally re-enter recurring tasks at Today+7, but sometimes if they recur infrequently, I'll re-enter at some later date, such as Today+2M.</div>
