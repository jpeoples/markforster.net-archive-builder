<div class="content">Mark, <br><br>Could you set a feed for comments in this forum as you do for comments on your articles ?<br><br>As some others I feel very uncomfortable to follow new posts : I often do not remember under which thread title is a content or a sender that interests me (or, even, in which I wrote !). I have to note date / hour of the most recent post I read. Even with that, I often find myself reading posts I discover I already read the day before ! <br><br>With a feed, I could have a glance at new posts, full read it and eventually immediately react to it if it stands out for me, and easily jump to posts just before in the thread.<br><br>This wouldn't require a change of your CMS (I do understand you would be very reluctant to do !) , just to set a new feed within it.<br><br>Really, that would help.</div>

<div class="content">I don't know if Mark will approve of it or not (if not, I can happily delete it), but I had made a feed for the forum for my personal use with Feed43:<br><br><a href="http://feed43.com/markforster-forum.xml" rel="nofollow">http://feed43.com/markforster-forum.xml</a><br><br>But I am afraid it does not work as you wish. It creates feeds only for the new threads, but not for replies on threads. Well, ces't pas évident. :)</div>

<div class="content">Nice Natalia, <br><br>Although it lists threads as in Mark's discussion list, I immediately spotted 4 threads I never visited (color of unvisited links) !<br><br>But, once you've visited a thread you do not know if there are new posts as in Mark's ? Or they are also sorted by most recent post in the thread ?<br><br>Nevertheless I stik to my former success (although I guess probability of success is very low ! ;)</div>

<div class="content">I think once you visit a thread it never shows up again on your RSS reader, I'm afraid. So, yes, it was useful only when the forum was not so frequently updated. :)</div>

<div class="content">Try <a href="http://www.changedetection.com." rel="nofollow">http://www.changedetection.com.</a> You can add each thread that interests you to changedetection. You will receive an e-mail/ RSS update when the left column updatesas well, but it's a start.</div>

<div class="content">I have created a new RSS feed with Feed 43 for the FV forum:<br><br><a href="http://feed43.com/markforster-fv-forum.xml" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://feed43.com/markforster-fv-forum.xml</a><br><br>The normal forum is still here:<br><br><a href="http://feed43.com/markforster-forum.xml" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://feed43.com/markforster-forum.xml</a><br><br>Those feeds simply show when a new topic has been opened, but not when there have been new replies. I use them in conjunction with Andreas' user script!</div>
