<div class="content">Due to a tragic reset of Firefox to its default settings, I lost the scripts that Andreas had written that highlight new posts. I tried searching the forums but found only outdated URLs. Interestingly, even Google's site search feature didn't dig them up for me.<br><br>Could someone post the URL where those scripts are? I did not realize how much i rely on them till they disappeared!<br><br>thx</div>

<div class="content">IanS:<br><br>Those URLs were not captured in Wayback. <br><br>Also searched Tampermonkey's and Greasemonkey's Userscripts areas with no luck. <br><br>Ah well -- great while it lasted.</div>

<div class="content">Mike Brown:<br><br>I put it on Github a few years back: <a href="http://github.com/andreasmaurer/markforster.net-improvements-userscript" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://github.com/andreasmaurer/markforster.net-improvements-userscript</a><br><br>Haven't done anything to it since then. Let me know if something is broken.<br><br>Kind regards,<br>Andreas</div>

<div class="content">Just bumping this once in case Mike doesn't see it because he doesn't have the script installed.</div>
