<div class="content">I have used GTD on and off for a while now, as I'm sure many of you have before. If I could address two issues, I think I could leave GTD and all its administrative overhead.<br><br>1: Things to check  out<br>   I have been putting articles I want to read, books I'd like to consider, movies I might like, etc on my to-do list and it is getting bogged down. These are things I want to check out and decide. Should I make another list and write a recurring "checkout something on my checkout list" task?<br><br>2: Due between now and next month<br>   I am a teacher, so almost all my tasks can be done now, but need to be done by a certain time. GTD says put these tasks on your todo list AND calendar, which was too much for me until I used RTM (see 2b). What is the best way to handle tasks that can be done now, but must be done within three weeks, for example? How do I track that due date?<br>   2b: Electronic implementation<br>      I searched for a long time before I settled a program that fits my needs (remember the milk with Google calendar and Google gears). RTM doesn't sort by entry date. Does anyone have an electronic version that syncs across multiple computers and can be used offline; preferably one that allows me to separate work and personal lists? Handwritten lists are not an option for me.<br><br>I'd love to leave GTD behind, I hope you can help!</div>

<div class="content">JTKaspar:<br><br>Here are my thoughts. <br><br>1. Those lists strike me as essentially shopping list (even though they might not be buying lists). So, thinking analogously, how would you handle a grocery list in AF? I don't think you would put down each item on the AF list (buy milk, buy bread, buy cheese). That doesn't seem right. Rather you would slowly compile a run-of-the-mill grocery list, adding things to purchase as you go along. When it came time to go shopping you would take that list.<br><br>So. . .if you compile a "things to check out list" it would be separate from the AF list. Nothing wrong with that. Now if you need help in getting around to *using* that list, then you would put a task on your AF list: "go grocery shopping." Or, in your case "browse books/movies".<br><br>2. I wonder if the best way to handle these types of things would be to enter the task on your list incorporating the deadline. Thus you would enter "Do X before Jan 1st". <br><br>I'm not sure about this, but it seems that AF would then bring this task to your attention in such a way that you would likely get it done well before the due date. I think this is one of the benefits of AF, it staves off our  tendency to procrastinate items to the last minute.<br><br>Now, if the "Do X before Jan 1st" task keeps coming up and you keep ignoring it, and it is "in danger" of being up for review over and over, but you save it by doing some work on it. . . well, it seems it will get done over time, and the due date will be staring you in the face over and over. (Probably no need to look at your calendar at all!)<br><br>Alternatively, if the task actually DOES come up for review. . . then I think it would mean you should evaluate whether it is ripe to put it in AF right now at all. Perhaps the due date is so far along, or you have so many other pressing and important tasks, that this item really shouldn't be on the radar until later.<br><br>How you make sure you get it on the radar (on the AF list) later would be something to think about.<br><br>--Joseph</div>

<div class="content">MS Outlook Tasks work fine. <br><br>Sort by "created" and stick in an "end of page" task every 30 tasks or so. Or bulk move to a new start date every 30 tasks or so (has the disadvantage of having the last page at the beginning).<br><br>Move to a separate "review" list, or use a "review" category with distinctive formatting.<br><br>Only really portable if your organisation runs an exchange server with web access enabled, though.<br><br>Some people here swear by Taskpaper.<br><br>I moved to paper with AF2, but I do miss the "open item only" filtering.</div>

<div class="content">JTKaspar:<br><br>Joseph has made some excellent points in his reply, so I'll just add a few thoughts.<br><br>I personally do a lot of reading and a lot of watching movies on DVD. So here's how I handle it.<br><br>If I hear of a book or movie that I want to check out I will put the title on my AF list with a question mark after it, e.g. Some Like It Hot? That is giving me the task to look up what is said about the book/movie on Amazon, Lovefilm, IMDB etc. That is a task that will only take a few moments, so I don't find any problem with that type.<br><br>If after checking it out I decide to order it I do so there and then.<br><br>I normally rent movies from Lovefilm. When the movie arrives (I have three at a time), I put the title on the AF list. I usually watch them in chunks of about 30 minutes, so they will get re-entered a couple of times. I keep up a fairly high turn-over of movies.<br><br>Books I treat rather differently. I keep all the books I currently want to read on a bookshelf with the last read on the left. I have a task "Reading" on my list. When that task comes up, I look along the books from the left and chose one. This gives priority to the ones I've been most recently reading.<br><br>With articles and on-line viideos, I put the title on the AF list (and if necessary where to find it) and treat it as any other task, doing it in chunks if it is long. I try to keep the numbers down - and it's essential to be prepared for them to go into Review Mode.</div>

<div class="content">I do like the reading idea Mark.  Thanks for that.  <br><br>I think of myself as lacking focus as I skip from one book to another but your system puts a structure in place around that kind of reading.  Nice one!

That is one I'm going to implement today.  Hmmmm, now if I can only find an empty bookshelf to use ... ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Re. future due dates, entering the task and putting the due date beside it in brackets is something I've done in AF since day 1 and have never not got those tasks done ahead of schedule.  I don't keep a calendar with reminders for anything except meetings and appointments (which at home go into my phone).<br><br>Re. the books and movies - I'm a big fan of using my local library which can order books or movies in from all over the province.  I enter them on my list individually and request them when the item stands out.   This provides a staggered approach to requests as you usually have a limit of ~25 items, and they come in on a staggered basis depending upon how many other people have requested it (for example I waited until last week to watch Slumdog Millionaire).<br><br>If they don't have the item available (which is rare), I check it out on google books or Amazon to see if it's worth buying and then can put it on my Amazon wishlist to save for an order.  I set myself a limit of how much I can buy in a month and if it makes the cut against the competition on the wishlist, I will order it.   This stops me from impulse buying books or movies that I will probably end up decluttering 6 months from now.  <br><br>When the items come in from the library, they notify me via email and I write "pick up holds at library" on my list (by date) (they return them if you don't pick them up within a week).  When I pick them up, I write the books/movies/CDs out individually on my list with the due date in brackets behind the book.  I also write the task "renew/return to library (date)" at that time.  Many times, I will end up just skimming through books I haven't read that are due and returning them rather than renewing.<br><br>Before doing AF, I had A LOT of overdue fines for books (I don't mind b/c it's supporting my library system) and spent a lot more at Amazon/bookstores (I do mind supporting Jeff Bezos) - and I used a calendar system.  I have had as many as 99 books out at a time (that's the limit, I found but AF has broken my reading addiction) and have had years where I spent thousands of $$ on books.<br><br>Re. articles (online), I email it to myself if the site has that functionality or email the link to myself.  I read them on my blackberry when I'm walking from my car to the office, at lunch or when I'm somewhere I have to wait.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">As someone who used GTD starting in 2001 and was convinced that it was best way to be productive (until I noticed how much time I spent on the system and not on doing) here's my advice--<br><br>Grab a notebook and just start AF. Do a "brain dump" as David Allen calls it to start off the list. Work off the list for the day. I found I was much more productive my first AF day than I was the day before on GTD.<br><br>I put everything in AF-- things I can't do now now, things that are due later, things I might do, things I don't know what to do with, etc. It all gets sorted out using the rules. No need to "process" and no need to "review" task lists.<br><br>I do keep a calendar for events and I do keep a project list with milestones someplace separate, which I review whenever review project list stands out. I also do a "weekly review" but this too only when it stands out in the AF list.<br></div>

<div class="content">I attempted to use GTD for years.  I was convinced it was the cat's meow.  Probably because it was the best system I'd found and I liked his books.  But, AF works magnitudes of order better for me.  I found with GTD that I would rarely do the weekly reviews. I felt great when I did them and like a complete failure the rest of the time.  Constant reviewing is built-in to the AF system.  Everything's right in front of you.  A single list works so much better for me than the scattered, compartmentalized lists of GTD.  <br><br>Regarding books and films:  I use Amazon for my books wish list -- not that I buy that much from Amazon, since I use the library or used book stores most of the time -- and Netflix for my DVD list.  The functionality of Amazon's lists is certainly imperfect, but it's worked pretty well for me.  There are other systems - I think Google has one - but it would take an awful lot of work for me to switch at this point and it works well enough.  Which book do I read next? This is an unscientific question.  If I'm in a book group and have to acquire a book fast, I might put that into my AF list to be sure I get it.  Otherwise, if I know that I'll have an "opening" in my reading life and I may want to reserve a book at the library, the title will either float up for me in some way, or I might peruse my Amazon list, remembering a particular book on the list that's "ripe" for me to read, and sometimes I'll stumble across others I've forgotten about.  Sometimes I'll dump a few too.  The Amazon list is also a stop gap for buying a bunch of books.  Just by putting something on the list, it satisfies a shopping-type urge.  Same with my DVD list. <br><br>On Netflix, since I always have a DVD on its way when I send one in, I have to keep at least the top of that list prioritized, so the DVD list kind of runs itself.</div>

<div class="content">I've used GTD for years, in various forms (digital, paper, OutLook, PDA, etc.) and switched overnight after discovering AF last March. I really liked the idea of multiple lists in GTD, but I found I hardly ever did anything from the lists. I just liked having them :-). I've ditched most of my context lists, only kept the "Waiting For" and "Agendas", but I do have a task "review Waiting For list" in my AF notebook.</div>

<div class="content">I too am a teacher (of a college variety), who spent too much time tweaking the GTD system (although enjoyed doing it) than actually doing things. <br><br>Regarding the tech implementation, as I've posted elsewhere, I suggest a simple outline program to simulate a notebook, creating new pages by separate headings. I'd use a notebook except for three reasons: 1) my iPhone is more portable than a notebook, and I have it with me always anyway; 2) my handwriting is often illegible, much worse than Mark's in his sample page (although his is pretty bad -- initially, I pulled out my Syriac dictionary before realizing that it was English! ;); 3) the electronic way makes re-entering and archiving a breeze. BTW, the way I use my tech implementation is strictly AF to the letter.<br><br>I like Jacqueline's idea about writing due dates on the item itself. Why didn't I think of it?!<br><br>Mark's reading method reminds me of what Mel does by having a separate AF reading list: enter "Read" in the main AF list; then go to the reading AF list to pick what stands out. In my case, however, 60% of my list consists of "Read"! (An occupational hazard.) So it is natural to have all my reading materials in the main list. I was able to weed out many  reading materials by "dismissing" them. <br><br>Finally, about watching movies in segments: I watch movies with my children. They need to go to bed at a certain time. We often violated it by saying, "Let's finish it; it's almost done." No more! When 9PM comes near, we stop it at a reasonable place. We finish the rest next evening.<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Cixelsyd,<br><br>I note an interesting and subtle difference between Jacqueline's solution to due dates and mine. Jacqueline enters her due dates in brackets following the item, somewhat as meta-information. My solution was to enter the task in form of an imperative with a date: "do X by Aug. 15".<br><br>Does is make any difference? I don't know if it would, except my version does seem to capture more precisely one's aim -- to accomplish the task on or before the due date. Would that impart a small psychological push each time you read that item?<br><br>Jacqueline's approach is without a doubt more simple and elegant. Those two qualities might commend it over my approach.<br><br>What do you folks think? Can the *way* you choose to phrase a task effect the way you do it? I'd be interested in thoughts on this.<br><br>Thanks,<br>--Joseph</div>

<div class="meta">2009-07-29 20:33</div>
<div class="content">Joseph, I'm not sure it's the writing (imperative or not) that's different for me.  I have found that anything that has a date in brackets *looks* different than writing out, so I don't ever miss dates.<br> <br>Return library books by Aug. 15<br><br>vs.<br><br>Return library books (8/15)<br><br>So it could be that everything that has a due date that looks like the latter will tend to stick out more.  Could be that I just like brackets!  (Obviously...)</div>

<div class="content">Joseph,<br><br>It really makes little difference to me as long as the deadline reminder is there. The only thing is that, theoretically, your way WOULD make me think, "Hmmm, due by Aug. 15? It's only July 29. It doesn't stand out. Next item." Jacqueline's way MAY encourage "little and often" more, although Jacqueline's "return library books" example works in favor of yours since we don't return library books "little and often." We can vary the way we mark the deadline depending on the nature of the action item.</div>

<div class="content">JT<br><br>You say "almost all my tasks can be done now, but need to be done by a certain time. GTD says put these tasks on your todo list AND calendar".  My understanding is that David Allen only recommends 3 items to go on a calander: appointments, tasks that must be done that day and things you need to remember about a day (like deadlines or its a bank holiday).  I've found this quite a useful rule.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Joseph<br><br>I think the way we phrase tasks does make a difference but would suspect that varies from person to person.  I rarely enter due dates (they just seem to be in my subconscious anyway) but when I do they are in a similar format to Jacqueline's - they seeem to stand out more easily but as a reminder rather than an imperative if that makes sense - I personally would have less resistance to Do Task x [due by] (8/10) than [You must] Do Task x by 8/10.<br><br>There have been some useful posts on rephrasing as a means of breaking down resistance to tasks - you may find the (rather outdated now) FAQ post helpful at<br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/645945" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/645945</a><br></div>

<div class="content">Cixelsyd - I'm afraid I do return library books "little and often" - those suckers get heavy!  <br><br>eg. tasks:<br>- double check online system for books due<br>- gather library books together (really have to start putting them on one shelf again)<br>- put library books in car<br>- return library books (when I'm close to that location or on my way home from work)<br><br>There's those darn parentheses again...!  :-)<br><br>I put in quite a few dates with my consulting client - some are dates I can *start* doing something (because I write things in as soon as I think of them and have to remind myself that I can't work on it yet), but most are when they're due.  In looking through my book, I can see it's very rare that I don't get them done a few days before the due date, it hasn't happened right on the date due yet, anyway.<br><br>AF facilitates early work much better for me than a calendar system ever did.

<div class="content">By way of introduction, I use GTD and found this tool in a user comment on LifeHacker.  I've not yet tried AF at all.<br><br>For the electronic part of this question, may I commit sacrilege and suggest a GTD tool.  ThinkingRock (www.thinkingrock.com.au) can pretty much do everything that you want.  You'll just have to ignore the GTD parts of it.  These are pretty tightly coupled, however the users have forced the developer to make it configurable enough to hide that stuff.  Just set the start-up page to the action list, sort that list by create date.  You probably should also turn-off things like contexts, criteria and topics.  You may want to keep one or other of them to logically split home and office lists from each other while keeping them physically in the same system.  You can create multiple tabs and set different filters for then so it could be a way to track your due-dates.<br><br>For portability, it can keep it's datastore on a flash drive.  If you realy need sync cababilities, then something like Dropbox might be up your alley.<br><br><br>Regards,<br>Craig Johnson</div>

I think GTD and RAF are totally compatible. The best part about RAF is that there is almost no friction to writing down whatever comes into your head, right at the end of the list. So when I open the fridge and see that my wife's out of milk (which I don't drink), I just write "buy milk" at the end of the list. When I realize there are several "buy X" items on my list, I add a new entry: "make shopping/errand list" and copy all the "buy X" and "get Y" tasks to that list. I get the satisfaction of crossing out all these things (including "make list"), even if I end up handing the list to my wife if she ends up going out for something before I do! If one or more items doesn't get done on that trip, it goes back on the RAF list. Simple, natural, easy.</div>

<div class="content">Hi ubi,<br><br>I didn't really comment on the compatibility or non-compatibility of GTD with RAF. . . but for what it's worth, I think they are compatible.<br><br>But, as to the use of a separate list for something, such as groceries: I can't really see the utility of the method you described. Unless I misread you, in order for you to make a grocery list you need to scan through all of your active pages and hope you pick out each item that you wish to buy, then write them on a list. It seems much more simple to write down groceries needed on grocery list.  If you are away from your grocery list, and think of an item you need, then perhaps enter "add X to grocery list" in your AF list. But that would be an exceptional case, I would think.<br><br>It seems to me that whatever other "normal" lists you have in your life, such as "grocery list" or "movie list" or "camping checklist", they can be profitably used with RAF, in as much RAF acts as the trigger to *use* those lists: "buy groceries", "get a movie", "go camping".<br><br>--Joseph<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Joseph,<br><br>There is a middle ground.  I have a few lists in my pocket book and I enter things directly onto those lists ... like groceries.  However, there are other lists I don't carry, such as books I hear about and want to read.  For those, I enter them on the AF list and then move them later when I can (basically I dismiss them) ... unless there is immediate action required then I do what is necessary from the AF list.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-08-19 13:33</div>
<div class="content">Mike,<br><br>Actually, that is basically what I have been getting at. If one does not have access to one's "actual" list (grocery, books to read, contacts, checklists) for whatever reason (by design or accident) THEN by all means put the item on the AF list either as itself (bread, War & Peace, John Smith 555-1234, power adapter) OR add it even more precisely as an actual task ("add bread to grocery list", "add War & Peace to someday reading list"). <br><br>My point being that AF isn't intended to "do away with lists". Rather it is a useful to tool that might help you populate lists, and more importantly DO things with those lists. Like actually go grocery shopping. Or read a book.<br><br>But note, that the *way* one uses list is very personal. For instance some people might need a list for books to read. . . someday. They don't need AF to help them chose a book from a list. They might need AF to motivate them to take a look at the list. Others might need to put various books dispersed throughout AF so that they can be driven to read this or that particular book.<br><br>However, it seems to me that some lists -- in particular *shopping* lists such as a grocery list shouldn't be dispersed in AF. You should have an actually shopping list like our backwards pre-AF ancestors. AF isn't meant to replace it. If you *can* put bread on a shopping list directly then I say do so. If you can't. . . well put it somewhere else if you will forget it.<br><br>But the last thing this world needs, I think, are a bunch of people scanning an AF list and deciding that "bread feels ready to be done."    : )<br><br>--Joseph</div>

I still use his example as my inspiration.  <br>On really debilitating days, this forum is only tap into the ouside world....I don't want to start feeling trepidation.....yes....even we lowly disabled folks have pride factors we wish to maintain..... Beside being accused of lacking courage or honor, being labelled backwards is amoung the worst felt insults.......I've built my life on staying progressive.My circumstances may have changed my abilities, but it hasn't changed my character or value system.<br>learning as I go<br>learning as I go<br></div>

<div class="content">Learning,<br><br>"Backwards pre-AF ancestors"   isn't pejorative towards those who do not use AutoFocus, but rather is poking fun at those who ONLY use AutoFocus and who think anything that existed *before* Autofocus, like making a grocery list, is outdated and backwards.<br><br>In other words, exactly what you are referring to in your post above. To get a sense of what i mean, imagine a group of college student engineers on a field trip to Egypt. The professor shows them the great pyramids and says "look what these poor backwards folk had to content themselves with before the advent of the computer." It is a way of indicating that the Egyptian builders were *not* backwards, and a warning *not* to be elitist and *not* to think the new system is better, or does away with, all old knowledge.<br><br>Hope that clear up my meaning. Apologies for any lack of clarity.<br><br>Thanks,<br>--Joseph</div>

<div class="content">Hi Joseph<br>Thank you for taking the time to explain that to me.  In fact, I owe you an apology as well.  I, using my referencing system, misinterpreted the thrust of your words.  For that, I sincerely apologize.<br>I thank you for your sense of honor (compassion being a subset) to take the time to elucidate your meaning driving your words more for my pride than my education.  I'm thankful for that, Joseph.<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Learning,<br><br>Thank you. One of the hallmarks of this forum, I think, is the civility and kindness shown among posters. I'm glad it was only a misunderstanding. <br><br>--Joseph<br><br>P.S. You mentioned your father's system of time management. Have you considered sharing that (or perhaps you already have in another thread)? I think you might have an interested group of people here!<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Joseph<br>I'm sure the regulars are thoroughly tired of hearing about my system! *blush*  Essentially, I was taught to review my responsibilities, my goals, my necessary study and practice times into a hierarchy.  Then I'd schedule them into the calendar.  Dad used to say...You don't need to find time for the important stuff.  It's up to you to make the time. He also stressed flexibility as a valued skill/attitude.<br><br>Then I'd carry a daily index card in my pocket (later a planner) to keep me on track with my appointments, responsibilities and progress on my goals/values.  The back was for notes or motivating quotes, etc....<br><br>Because of the vascillating severity of my pain, I can't reliably adhere to a schedule.  When I can't, timeboxing is a great substitute.  It's also a great pacer to push past my pain to do the best that I can with my day.....both being productive and feeling the gratitudes of other gifts life grants us.<br><br>The system is fairly simple but encouraged reflection and goal seeking as well as using inspiration, passion and gratitude as fuel for the engine.  I NEEDED a heavily driven schedule because I suffer when I'm not stimulated enough.  I also incorporated a cap of scutwork to 90" daily on average...or 6hrs a week.  That allows me to focus on the important and pleasurable aspects of life without the mundane hogging up too much of my resources.......<br>Is this clear as mud?  LOL  *blush*   See?  I told you it was fairly ordinary and boring...but, it sure served me well to living a thriving and passionate lifestyle<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>This method requires lots of determination and little or no structured procrastination.  Scheduling blended with values and passion based priorities extinguishes most of procrastination.....but I was raised since a child to over ride immediate resistance and to plow down and grunt hard when necessary in service of values and goals.  <br>Being disabled has forced me to learn different ways to meet my aims....but I still follow my list in the order I wrote it......In case I can't finish, at least I expended my energy on the most important goals and responsibilities......<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Joseph,<br><br>>>>  But the last thing this world needs, I think, are a bunch of people scanning an AF list and deciding that "bread feels ready to be done." : )  <<<<br><br>ROTFLMAO ;-)  Yeah, that's about it!  ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Learning,<br><br>Thanks for that review.  I share your values in that way.  I think that one must understand values, and then goals before one prioritize and only then can one consider any kind of schedule or implementation.  I realize that this puts me at odds with the AF philosophy, but I do still find AF useful when placed in the context of the rest of my plan.  IOW, I use AF when I have unplanned time in my life after prioritized crucial tasks and blocked time for big projects.<br><br>Works for me ;-)<br><br>As to discipline ... I am sorely lacking there, but I recognize that it is a character attribute that must be built much as we build a muscle ... through resistance.  Or, as the story goes, if you pray for the virtue of tolerance, you will be sent people into your life who will cause you to want to hate them ... and only by overcoming that desire, you you achieve tolerance.  I don't usually like religious parables, but this one seems to convey the point exceptionally well.  ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike<br>Yes, I think we're quite similar in many respects.  In fact, I'd dare say that if I met you and Jacq in real life, we'd likely be great friends!  *blush*<br>Like you, I have a miscellaneous list.  On days when I'm having trouble with my ordinary habits, I'll write a short list and do what I can with it.  <br>And please....don't think that I'm not aware of the monkey and the donkey living in my brain!  LOL!  Depending on which is acting up and messing with my intentions, I have my little tweaks and work arounds.....In fact, the donkey is sometimes more challenging to contend with than certain levels of pain!  LOL!.....<br>but I value our relationship as well......the monkey encourages my curiousity, awe and gratitudes when I'm not trying to follow my work plan.  ....and that donkey gives me perserverance in the face of hardship and challenge.  Ironically, I use his persistant nature to hoodwink his stubborn refusal!  ROTFL!  <br>I've been known to last minute some stuff, but I've never been one to actually drop the ball and allow things to fall into neglect. It somehow relates to how I want to uphold my quality of life overall.....and to guide my life trajectory.  I can't say this is the best way.  I've known lots of people who thrive marvelously on reacting only to last minuting their stuff just before the bomb explodes...or don't measure their quality of life standards using the same stick as me.  They coast blissfully through life by the seat of their pants....LOL!  They are actually content.....bottom line, that's what matters, yeah?<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>secret.....I don't think it's really discipline as much as knowing when to choose your actions for the process or for the purpose of the result.....again, values and goals.  I hate grunting as much as anybody....but when it's in service of someone or something I cherish or regard highly, I WANT to do it......not to suffer with the boredom or actual pain, but that feeling of being a good steward of the principles, passions, and people I cherish.<br>Besides, I hate the drag effect that ignoring stuff creates......it ruins my vibe!  ROTFL!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content"><<Man of Kent: My understanding is that David Allen only recommends 3 items to go on a calander: appointments, tasks that must be done that day and things you need to remember about a day>><br><br>I haven't read the book closely, but I have listed to the CD set (Getting Things Done Fast) several times. I'm sure David Allen says "What if something doesn't need to get done right now, but needs to be finished by a certain date? Just put it on your context list and put a reminder in your calendar"</div>
