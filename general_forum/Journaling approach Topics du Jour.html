<div class="content">I don't know if anyone else samples the Litemind blog (<a href="http://litemind.com" rel="nofollow">http://litemind.com</a> ); Luciano posts infrequently but I find his posts usually very interesting and imaginative.<br><br>Anyway, he describes a journaling approach from the book "Journal to the Self" in his latest post, "Topics du Jour" (<a href="http://litemind.com/topics-du-jour/" rel="nofollow">http://litemind.com/topics-du-jour/</a> ).<br><br>Mark has discussed journaling on this blog and in his books, and I used the dialoging technique described in DREAMS for a while; I also did the 3 morning pages for a while. I do still occasionally (ie, not often enough!) use the DREAMS book's Future reality/Current reality device to prompt my big-dream journaling.<br><br>What I like about the Topics du Jour approach is that it provides a structure to pull various topics to the fore for a few minutes of full attention, probably enough to prime the brain so that it can work on options in the background over the next 2 weeks or so. But because you have multiple topics to choose from, there's enough novelty that one doesn't get too bored.<br><br>I could see using this approach to "check in" on dormant projects, habits one wants to encourage, and so on.<br><br>Mike<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi, Mike<br><br>Thanks very much for giving this reference. Topic du Jour sounds a great idea. I must try it out.<br><br>I followed some of the links in Luciano's article and came across two other great ideas:<br><br>The List of 100<br><a href="http://litemind.com/tackle-any-issue-with-a-list-of-100/" rel="nofollow">http://litemind.com/tackle-any-issue-with-a-list-of-100/</a><br><br>The Idea Quota<br><a href="http://litemind.com/get-mentally-fit-with-an-idea-quota/" rel="nofollow">http://litemind.com/get-mentally-fit-with-an-idea-quota/</a><br><br>I wonder which will prove the most effective?</div>

<div class="content">Glad you enjoyed the Topics du Jour approach. I share the opinion that journaling is a great companion to traditional productivity systems. I love how such a 'soft' tool such as journaling can complement 'hard' productivity concepts such as deadlines, batching, etc.<br><br>I haven’t seen the DREAMS book -- it seems that’s not on sale anywhere anymore :( Mark, can you confirm?<br><br>Mark: It's interesting that you highlighted these two particular articles (The List of 100 and the Idea Quota) as they resemble the difference between traditional journaling and Topics du Jour. <br>List of 100 (and traditional journaling) is a tool to get deep in a problem at once, to get immersed in it. <br>Idea Quota (and Topics du Jour) goes in a more 'lateral' approach, where ideas marinate for a long time.<br>It's hard to say which one is more effective. I’ve got benefits for both. I think it depends on the problem you’re working on. Needless to say, you get maximum effectiveness when you combine both.<br><br>Luciano.</div>

<div class="content">Luciano<br><br>I'll be very interested to see how the methods compare. I have so far tried out the 100 ideas method on the question "100 Ways to Make Money". I stuck all the ideas I came up with into a mind map and I think I got at least as much benefit from organising the ideas into categories in the mind map as I did from thinking up the ideas themselves. <br><br>In answer to your question about "Dreams", it is now out of print and will not be re-printed. I have got the distribution rights and the text back from the publisher and am in the process of making it available as an e-book.</div>

<div class="content">Mark, may I ask you how much was the print run of the "Dreams" book? (I don't know if I managed to express that correctly, I mean how many copies were printed.) <br>It's strange that there isn't a single copy to be found at Amazon Marketplace, much unlike the GED and DIT books, where there are a lot of used and new copies from third-party vendors. So I presume that maybe there was a rather small number of "Dreams" books printed. Or maybe, it's just because nobody is willing to sell their used copy :-)</div>

<div class="content">Alex:<br><br>The first (and only) print run for "Dreams" was 5,000, which has now sold out.<br><br>I suspect the lack of copies in Amazon Marketplace reflects the fact that it's not possible to buy it new, rather than the total number of copies printed.<br><br>Since the other two books can be bought brand new quite cheaply, there is not such a demand for used copies.<br><br>By the way, it's just come out in Arabic (I received my copies today), though I doubt if that's much comfort to you!</div>
