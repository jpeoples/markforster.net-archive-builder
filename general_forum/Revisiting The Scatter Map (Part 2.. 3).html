<div class="content">At risk of being too facile with respect to Mark's work, I divide his ideas into two groups: <br><br>1. Linear, list driven, comprehensive i.e. Autofocus, DWM, etc<br>2. Non-linear, organic, open-ended i.e. Dreams, No List, etc<br><br>For me, the question that drives my interest to implement any of these ideas is: <br><br>What is the **best** approach to managing myself when I have discretionary time. I manage my scheduled time - clinical appts, kids schedules, etc - quite well. <br><br>I've experimented with enough of Mark's systems to know that category 2 (non-linear) works best for me. To that end, I started experimenting with a reverse Scatter Map** .<br><br>1. Start the day with a blank page<br>2. Commit to one thing that you think is a good thing to do (based on energy, time available, etc)<br>3. Write the current time and the thing you're going to work on.<br>4. If you're torn between a few things, write all of them down (Generally, I never generate more than 3-4 things)<br>5. Circle the best one<br>6. Work on the thing <br>7. Any thoughts, follow-up tasks, questions about the thing you're working on receives a branch to the right of the item. <br>8. Any thoughts, tasks, questions about something not related to the thing you're working on goes to the left of the thing you're working on.<br>9. When you're finished working on the thing, and if you have more discretionary time, begin again from #2 --> #9<br><br>At the end of the day, you'll have an interesting image - a circuitry of your thoughts, things you've worked on, things you need to do - that serve as a graphic for your journal, or weekly review. <br><br>Silly as this sounds, my brain is soothed (and excited) by a blank page at the beginning of the day. It also helps that the flow is not linear, but more akin to a Scatter Map. And the final result has an aesthetic that is closer to what I think is going on in my brain vs the linear to-do/autofocus list. <br><br>**For more on Scatter Maps: <a href="../blog/The Scatter Map.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2016/5/19/the-scatter-map.html</a> )</div>

<div class="content">I went to my copy of the book "Get Everything Done"  and got a good look at it. <br><br>I see Shakespeare there.  I think I will start a thread on it.</div>
