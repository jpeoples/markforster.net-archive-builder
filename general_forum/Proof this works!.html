<div class="content">My husband resists productivity tools and thinks I'm nuts for trying new methods.  He did the same eye roll when I embraced AF (right before he left for a business trip.)  <br><br>He's been extremely busy and something important fell through (his) cracks while he was gone.  It devastated him!<br><br>Meanwhile I knocked out tons of things in his absence and was calm, cool and collected.  He came in at 1 am and immediately noticed how great our place looked.  Then he told me his sad story.<br><br>Guess what he wants to do tonight?  Shop for his own moleskin - that's what!</div>
