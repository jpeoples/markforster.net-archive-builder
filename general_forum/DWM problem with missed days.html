<div class="content">I like DWM and really am finding it to be DIT-ish, as Mark said.  But I am having trouble with the recommended mechanics for handling missed days.<br><br>I took a 3-day vacation last weekend and went to the snow with my children.  We had a great time.  When I got back, I did the page re-dating as Mark recommends.  A bit confusing, but turns out it worked just fine.<br><br>But then I was travelling Tuesday and Wednesday this week.  I was able to spend a little time processing my list, so I didn't count them as missed days.  Part of my motivation for that was it's just too much overhead to deal with the re-dating of the pages.<br><br>Now this weekend, I had a couple issues.  One, it's a weekend and I don't always have time to look at my list -- I'm just spending the day with my wife and children and following whatever they want me to do.  Two, I was sick for a good chunk of the weekend.   So basically I've only glanced at my list for the last 2-3 days.  <br><br>So now it's the end of the day.  I have about 15 minutes and wanted to relax a bit, so I came to look at the forum here.  Meanwhile I have a handful of tasks on my 2/</div>

<div class="content">Oops, keyboard mishap caused the post to be posted before I finished writing it...  I'll just continue...<br><br>So now it's the end of the day. I have about 15 minutes and wanted to relax a bit, so I came to look at the forum here. Meanwhile I have a handful of tasks on my 2/15 page, which should all roll over Niagara Falls today if I don't work on them.  <br><br>I feel I'm fully justified in running the re-date-the-pages algorithm, but it's just becoming a hassle.<br><br>I've considered not using dated pages, as some have suggested.  I think it makes logical sense.  No need to renumber anything if you are away for a bit.  But I'm wanting to run the DWM beta as per Mark's instructions, and see how it goes.<br><br>So, I guess this post should just be considered feedback on the system as it stands, and not so much an appeal for help.<br><br>Anyone else encountering this issue?</div>

<div class="content">My only suggestion is, when you don't work at weekends, then don't. --> Meaning that you re date everything but skip-dates from the weekend. E.g with a 4 day break coming Wednesday 17th would become Tuesday 23th (not Sunday 21st). <br><br>That's my approach.....</div>

<div class="content">Seems to me that if it's a planned break it would be easiest to never use those dates for the +7 or +30.  That way the break would be built in.<br><br>If it's unplanned - no good solution.</div>

<div class="content">Yeah, once I get a month into it I'm convinced I'll drop the linkage to the calendar.  It is just too much of a hassle to manage missed days.  Numbing is so obvious to me that I can't imagine many people NOT reverting to that.  I do get that the date has a psychological effect, but I think that in the long run it will be a wash no matter how you do it.  I have the option of using colored pages, maybe I'll make every so many pages a different color to give me some feedback on the time remaining.  I suppose that using a colored marker would work as well.<br><br>Basically, this system seems to have the most overhead of all the AF systems.  The system should not get in the way of getting everything done ;-)<br><br>Just thinking out loud here.  ;-)</div>

<div class="content">If I'm reading this thread correctly after one hour's sleep on an overnight flight from South Africa to the UK, I think the problem associated with renumbering pages and shifting tasks around makes an electronic solution even more viable.<br><br>I'm using ListPro FWIW, but most e-solutions seem to be able to address the problem.<br><br>Mike's second last sentence in his 11:10 posting needs to be borne in mind.<br><br>If there is a backlog caused by an unplanned break of event, should not recovery of the worthwhile tasks be the subject of a Current Initiative within a Closed List?</div>

<div class="content">Roger: Are you saying most electronic tools have an "automatically redate all tasks" command?  I'm very surprised.</div>

<div class="content">Alan - I understood Roger to mean that it's easier/quicker to re-date tasks electronically than on paper (but it still needs to be done by hand - although a find&replace on date isn't that manually intensive)<br><br>Mike - I'm planning to keep the dated pages, I think it'll be too easy for me to let numbered pages 'slide' and not dismiss when they should be. <br><br>going back to the original question...For unplanned breaks, I think I'd do what Roger suggested - review the past-due pages, do what's still time-critical/important and re-schedule or dismiss the rest. OTOH, it depends...at home last week I had a few unplanned off-list days and I was 'ahead enough' that I didn't bother to re-date any of the pages, I just gave the pages a 24hour 'grace period' before they got dismissed. <br><br>Based on how my list's been going the last couple of weeks, I think I'd more likely go with a 'grace period' of 1 or 2 days instead of re-dating pages, especially at home. But then again, I haven't hit this with my work DWM list, so reality may come up with something else :)  <br><br>At work, (DWM on excel) I use "today+28" instead of 30 to avoid getting weekend dates.</div>

<div class="content">Lillian,<br><br>I take your point that if it is too easy to put off doing things they might get put off.  OTOH, I'm sure it is just as easy to not renumber pages and just "extend" time by not letting pages expire.  I guess that if you want to get by the point of the rules, there will always be a way to do it.</div>

<div class="content">If you use a week as the unit of time rather than have a daily list, it builds in more flexibility for variable amounts of available time. That's why I'm trying out a weekly tweak!</div>

<div class="meta">2010-02-16 17:48</div>
<div class="content">Mike - that's true, but I'm not sure there's much, if any, difference between re-dating / numbering pages by a couple of days for unplanned off-list days vs giving pages a 1 or 2 day 'grace period' for unplanned off-list days. Either way they're being dismissed a later than originally determined.  Of course, if unplanned off-list days happen more often than not, maybe this isn't the best system for someone</div>

<div class="content">Missing days not only makes some things overdue, it also cuts down the incubation period of those month tasks.  Too much of this seriously undermines the integrity of the system.  Naturally this depends on how many days get missed, and how much pressure you're under.  <br><br>I think I'll take a cue from Jane and push things back a week when several days get missed.  And for current week recovery I'm taking my cue from Roger (and a few others) to rethink my expired (due to absence from list) tasks and upcoming tasks.</div>

<div class="content">Wow, a flurry of contributions, and I still haven't caught up on my sleep!  Should I 're-hour' my slumber?!?!  Pathetic, sleep deprivation wins!<br><br>Alan: no, not automatically re-date all tasks, for two reasons:<br>(1) I'm not that IT-gifted, I have had ListPro for several years, it's basic and works for me.<br>(2) I believe any adaptation needs to be pragmatic, not rigidly governed by hard and fast rules all the time.<br><br>What I meant is that it is so easy to change a couple of date characters and the list resorts itself.  Lillian picked up on this.<br><br>Lillian: I'm like you, my NEW (first time) tasks have a Status: 'NEW ENTRY (Today + 28)' and UNfinished tasks are 'RE-ENTRY (Today + 7)'.  However, the target date is not automatically calculated, I base it on other known factors.  Example: if + 7 (or 28) clashes with an all-day event, holiday, whatever, I'll adjust it "manually" and select + 6 or + 8.  It's still saves me typing or rewriting all the task's other details.<br>Even if I forget, I may pick up a dates clash when I'm scanning the list in AF4 fashion, in which case I'll revamp the Diary Date field value as required.  At least the electronic approach makes revisions easy and I can start tomorrow with an updated 'clean' ListPro report.</div>

<div class="content">Well, I have another variant (Mark, forgive me): I use Today+6 and Today+24 in a notebook without dates. Reasons are: <br>* I regard the weekend as one day/page, since during the weekend I have so many unplanned activities, want to spend time with my kids and my wife, ... (that's why I use multiples of 6)<br>* I want to see weekend related tasks on my weekend pages (e.g. pocket-money for the kids, doing things in the house, weekly review, ...) (that's why the second entry point is 4 weeks away)</div>

<div class="content">Lots of cool input here. For me, I either don't look at my list at ALL on the weekend, OR my dear hubby takes the five kiddos for an outing and gives me a gift of the house to myself for 4 hours -- and then I tackle my list like crazy. (This was with the AF versions)<br><br>I've been doing DWM for two weeks now, and haven't looked at my list at all on the weekends (time for hubby to step it up!) and I ran into that problem of things expiring all of a sudden on Monday morning when my list was out again. But what I did was re-evaluate instead of just ditching the weekend pages with whatever tasks were undone. <br><br>I allowed myself two minutes to do one of three things with each item (and I have 24 lines on a page, so that's the max, which made for one hour max for the re-evaluation): <br><br>(1) a quick teeny something on the task, the teeniest thing possible, then re-entering it seven days out (from Monday, not the original weekend +7 so it would end up on another weekend and perpetuate the original problem). I love to crochet and it's not usually on my list, because I just pick it up when I'm watching a DVD on downtime. But I am trying to get my nephew's afghan done by the end of the school year. A little bit, often, is going to be key for this, so I put "Adam's afghan" on the list. It was going to expire Sunday, so on my Monday morning evaluation, I really did get out the afghan, crochet three stitches and moved the task accordingly!!<br><br>or<br>(2) enter the task 30 days out as a NEW task. i.e. MAKE it new by approaching it a different way. For example, my husband has completed a novel and is in the midst of the publisher/agent hunt. I have tried to be a good helper to him. I was failing. My list said "Find publisher". It's not clear enough, not motivational enough. I re-entered it 30 days out (on one of those Monday mornings) as "Find 5 publishing houses accepting manuscripts". THAT actually got accomplished already!<br><br>(3) Let it go!<br><br>So far, that evaluation process is really helping me. I think the same will work for me for sick days, vacation days, etc. Although I really like the idea of NOT using the pages when you have PLANNED days off (who DOES that? I really should...) (grin)</div>
