<div class="content">I red a lot of book aou business or organization. From MF, COVEY, D ALLEN, LINENBERGER, FERRIS, an so on.... I could write a page....<br><br>I still do but 2 books has indeed changed my life. Both still has a crucial influency on each action and decision, I take everyday and  for years. <br><br>The two are from Mark H Mac cormack the incredible business maker and lawyer who buid an incredible group around sport. He died a few years ago. Here is the link on wikpedia<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_McCormack<br><br>He was really an incredible man. He wrote many many books. I red What They Don't Teach You at Harvard Business School which is the best book I ever red about business. It is my business bible for years. I apply his method in my negociation with an incredible succes. I read it again and again (is is quiet unreadble for now I need to find another copy at RIVAGE les echos) when I feel turn out or simply feel a lack of motivation, I read it. I am able to make a citation of some entire pages :-)<br><br>The secont is the one I am finishing. Getting Results for Dummies: Get Organized, Stay Focused, and Get Things Done! which is amazing and very interesting in my way of working. it is nerest my natural way of doing, things and plan. I red it 2 years ago and red it again last month. I decided to quit GTD for it about one month ago for many reasons, the most important is that it is not adapted to business maker and very intuitive people (however I kept some basic principle) <br><br>When I read a book, I use the same method. I resume each chapter with my own writing. (I did it for MF secret of productive people ;-). ) I apply the method from 3 days to one month and see what happens. Definitively Mark H Mac cormack suits to me. It needs a serious focusing but not as GTD it is lighter. It is more structured than others. It is a quiet of equilibrium between 2 worlds. <br><br>My goal is now to finish my executive summary "Getting Results for Dummies" and build around it my own way in the simpliest way. Of course I had little things I read here or anywhere else like yours Mark, (DIT, Forum, SPP) which are also very interesting. <br><br>After that, I think I will try to see all others books of Mark H mac cormack. (MCH) in dive into it. <br><br>It is incredible how some people may have a positive influency on people life. I wish I could have met him and spend a little time with him. For me he understood perfectly the way the world is mooving and how people try to stay in the course. In his book even if he is incredible practical and efficient he stays simple and direct. Love it. + Rest in peace +  MCH +  I will never forget the light you brought to me and to so many of us:.</div>

<div class="content">Michael<br><br>Could I elaborate on what you wrote below? "When I read a book, I use the same method. I resume each chapter with my own writing."<br><br>Well it's very simple. There are 2 kinds of book. some just interesting (or not) and some I want to remember. I use to take notes in front of each Chapter. ... Harvard was one of these so it is now difficult to read. <br><br>No I just take a piece of paper and summerize each chapter with my words. It has 2 effects. One is to remember it at a glance. The secont is to let my books perfectly clean and readable. I can then re read a book 10 times in a very short while and goto the chapters if something is crucial for me<br><br>My notes are like this ie MF productive people <br>P9 Ch2 MF thinks we have to learn from history. Newton questioned the universe, Van gogh focused attention, Ford created a better system. <br><br>That's all which interested me in this chapter but it was interesting. If I need some details I just go to the chapter 2 page 9 and see what he tells about Ford for example. <br><br>I also can compare at a glance 2 different approach of writters about the same subjects and feed my brain for a better thinking. I can compare easely 3 or 4 methods simoultanously. <br><br>I also write my own opinion about a book. For example MF in SPP has made a very interesting book. The most interesting part is for me chapter 5 about questionning and chapter 10 where he explains that we have to grow our minds. <br><br>All is written most of the time on a A4 dated piece of paper like this <br>Ch1<br><br>Ch2<br><br>But it can also be on a single or 2 oxford Bristol (? correspondence cards (approx. 12x20 cm)) all white that I fill little by little. When I finish a book it goes in there so I can read it later. <br><br>Hope that's help</div>
