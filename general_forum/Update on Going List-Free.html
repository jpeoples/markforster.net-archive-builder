<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-12-3 3:22</div>
<div class="content">I spoke with Mark several weeks ago on the DIT Yahoo group about my decision to go list-free, at least for the time being. He asked me to give him an update at some point which I am doing. I may be wrong, but I think it's been about 3 months now of no AF or really any TM system.<br><br>I made it clear on the Yahoo list that I am not recommending what I am doing for everyone. Of the TM methods I've used (and I've used many!), AF worked best for me for longer than any of them. I think my personality and experiences are such, however, that lists became counter-productive. I am one of the few people using AF whose list would grow and grow.<br><br>With those disclaimers, here are the benefits of no lists I continue to experience to date:<br>1) Significantly reduced stress level. Repeatedly viewing all the things that I wanted/needed to do made me feel like I was behind and would never catch up.<br>2) Easier to let go of unrealistic/low priority goals and activities. I had goals of wanting to read the top 100 books and watch the top 100 movies of all time for example. I kept trying to chip away at those goals because I saw them crop up on my AF list all the time. Without a list, I've let those goals go for now and am fine with doing so.<br>3) Increased self-esteem. I was always gauging my success by what I hadn't done (the items still on the list) and the size of my ever-growing list. It didn't matter that I was doing 60 different things in a day. I still felt like a failure. Today I feel like so many of my easy-going friends do. I guess it's a little like "Don't Sweat the Small Stuff" for me now.<br>4) No more hassle with "interruptions." In addition to giving up my list, I've tried to give up my expectations. Before I'd think, "I'm going to close out 3 pages today" or "I'm going to get x, y, and z done." In my particular situation, someone was always keeping me from doing that! Now I check my calendar, but aside from those items, I have no preconceived ideas of what I will accomplish on a given day. Please note that I don't mean I have no goals. I do! I even have a general idea of how I'd like to get there, but I'm also open to not taking that route.<br><br>Here are the disadvantages to going list-free for me:<br>1) It can lead to throwing the baby out with the bath water. I haven't been as diligent about recording items that have due dates, even those I'm likely to forget. I hope to correct that bad habit. Should I do that tomorrow, Mark? ;-) I've noticed that I have also done away with some of the routines I had that were actually functional. I expect that after I've had my "vacation" time, that I will re-establish some of these.<br>2) Occasionally not knowing what to do first. I can honestly only think of a couple of times I have felt this in the past 3 months. I've found that this feeling is related to disad #3.<br>3) Occasionally feeling overwhelmed. I find it interesting that I have had this experience twice and both times the overwhelm was related to deadlines. It wasn't the "clean out garage" kind of stuff that made up the bulk of my AF list. The other interesting thing is that the first time it happened, I made a list and felt better. I didn't even need to look at it again. The second time, I didn't even finish the list. The act of beginning to write the list confirmed that I had no reason to panic. <br><br>I have many big deadlined projects between now and the end of March. I will try to update again after that and let you know if I've changed my approach.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mel,<br><br>One of the things working with AF taught me more than anything is how little time we actually have to do all those things we want to do as well as deal with all the regular stuff.  If you have a lot of interests like you and I do and not a lot of time to do them in like you and I don't, it seems the only way to peace is focusing on what has to be a priority and learning to expect and do less - or commit to only a few things.  <br><br>I would still like to know how Mark and others kept their lists in check.  I had to do it in a mechanical way, but maybe there's some pre-filtering gene that we don't have.</div>

<div class="content">"I would still like to know how Mark and others kept their lists in check."<br><br>I try to follow the rules. And I try and do AF for at least one hour a day. <br><br>Mel's "no list" approach is MY life pre-systems -  a shameful amount of web surfing.</div>

<div class="content">avrum, if I had followed the rules as far as list additions go, I would have ended up with a longer list than Seraphim.  Keeping an upper limit on length was pretty easy though.<br><br>My life right now with not a whole lot of system isn't a shameful amount of web surfing.  I think it depends on whether you have external accountabiity or not.  I do for the most part and Mel does too.  My guess is you don't and that's a toughie.</div>

<div class="content">Avrum, I made this point on the email list that some people need a whole lot more structure. I get that, especially as I have been one of those people at times. I'm just at a place right now where I need less. I get obsessed with the method itself, which I knew you understand.<br><br>Jacqueline, you're exactly right. I was always asking that question--how do you determine what goes on the list. 'Everything' is a dangerous answer to someone with my brain. lol I thought I learned this lesson from DIT that I have precious little time to devote to non-essentials, but I just refused to believe it. :-) <br><br>The other thing I have been pondering lately which is applicable to everyone here is our tendency to seek ONE solution. Like it either has to be GTD or AF or something else or nothing. And if it's the "right" method, you must use it forever. Why? Why couldn't I be comfortable and confident using GTD if that feels right for a season, then AF, then nothing, and then cycling back. Changing approaches doesn't mean there is anything wrong with the approach or with the person, does it? It's actually a sign of a mentally balanced person who knows how to use the right tool at the right time. In other words, I don't want to avoid using a list either. I'll use one if that feels right; otherwise, I won't. What a concept. lol</div>

<div class="content">"Like it either has to be GTD or AF or something else or nothing"<br><br>In my case, it was simply a matter of meeting my productivity soul mate. I envy GTD users for the toys they have, but AF rules work for my lifestyle - solopreneur - & disposition - creative, emotive.</div>

<div class="content">Avrum, you won't be surprised given the current divorce statistics that I don't see "soul mate" as meaning a forever relationship no matter what we're talking about. That being said, I do think AF is a very good "catch."</div>

<div class="content">Gerry, I'm really only using my calendar. I have made a list on Toodledo twice, too, for deadlined tasks but then never ended up looking at the list. Just so you know, that doesn't mean I spend my time exclusively web surfing. :-) In the past 3 months, I coordinated a large public event for which I handled all the publicity, produced a video, prepared for and taught Bible classes, homeschooled a high schooler other than my own 6 kids, hosted a family of 7 in my home for a few days, started a small Girl Scout troop, entertained a ridiculous number of times, wrote a 50,000-word novel, played lots of tennis, did huge amounts of baking and cooking, and plenty more. So glad I made this list so I know I AM doing something!</div>

<div class="content">Mel, I think you've hit the nail on the head here for me:<br><br>'The other thing I have been pondering lately which is applicable to everyone here is our tendency to seek ONE solution.'<br><br>I've come to the point where my" time management system" changes daily, and in fact, several times through the day.  At work, I tend to just be quickly responsive, don't work with a list or any external tool other than email and am just very responsive, working almost entirely through email or on big projects.  If I do make a list, it's a checklist to think my way through a project.  If a task emerges from a meeting, I just do it at the first opportunity so it's out of my head and off my back.<br><br>At home, I do best when having routines for maintenance types of activities and enthusiasm for big projects.  I don't follow routines at work at all because that's not the nature of my work - it's a different thing every day.<br><br>When I feel kind of wiped out, it's helpful for me to make a big 25 item list and do things that stand out - a la AF condensed - or do task sandwiches to build some rewards.  Or get myself motivated and excited to tackle a bigger project or get in that "will do" mode like Mark's GTD to power through a list of things to do in a day.  <br><br>That's true working by intuition to me - working in accordance with how you feel, what your energy levels are like, the nature of the task at hand.</div>

<div class="content">Mel:<br><br>Thanks for the update, and I'm delighted to hear how well your "list-free" life has gone for you. As I think I said to you at the time, I've tried to do this several times myself but the result has always been chaos. In fact the chaos resulting from the absense of any form of system was the main reason I got into time managment theory in the first place.<br><br>I suspect the same is true of you - that you got into time management systems because you were not satisfied with your previous standard of organisation. So the one question I would really like to ask you is this: what are the most important differences between the way you lived "pre-list" and the way you are now living "post-list"?</div>
<h2>Reply by Gerry</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-12-6 2:23</div>
<div class="content">Mel,<br><br>I can see how that works.  I wrote an article awhile back on the idea that lots of time management systems say not to use a calendar to manage time yet, a basic question about any time management system is to figure out when you actually will do something and a calendar certainly lets you see when you have the time to get things done.  I also like the fact that is relies on one tool.  I find I do best when I only use one thing to manage my time.<br><br><br>Thanks<br><br>Gerry<br><br><a href="http://simpletimemanagement.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://simpletimemanagement.blogspot.com/</a></div>

<div class="content">One of the key things (for me) about Mark's system is not that it gets things done - it helps in stopping activities (through the Review process) that, after reflection, are irrelevant, and to redirect that attention to things that take us further on our path - even if it is only to ponder on what that path might be. It requires honesty to oneself, and loss of ego. Both things which are virtually impossible, but lights to follow.</div>

<div class="content">Laurence:<br><br>Yes, you've got it exactly. It's easy to pile up activities. Not so easy to make sure those activities are all heading in the same direction!</div>

<div class="meta">2009-12-6 12:35</div>
<div class="content">Hi Mark. Thank you for always being so gracious. Before trying GTD, DIT, and then AF, I had this generalized anxiety that I wasn't even aware of. I slept fine and didn't appear to be anxious but I was. The difference between then and now isn't in terms of how much I'm doing or even the kinds of things I do. I've always been the kind of person who evokes, "How does she do it all?"<br><br>The most important difference for me is the peace that I have without the list. That peace has been evident in several ways. The first way is knowing that I've done enough each day. No matter how many tasks I crossed off with AF, I didn't feel like I had succeeded. The continuous expansion of the list didn't help! That's obviously my issue and has nothing to do with the system. I think the question I was asking every TM approach I tried was: Am I enough? AF isn't designed to answer that question obviously! But not having a list is a little like not weighing yourself every day. It's easier to be satisfied when you're not constantly analyzing.<br><br>The second reason I have more peace without the list is because I've also done away with the unrealistic expectations I've had of myself my whole life. Is it possible to keep AF and just lose the expectations? I think so. I would like to hear from anyone who tries this. With AF, I would think, "Today I'm going to close out X number of pages" or even, "I'm going to finish x, y, and z today." With having six children and a dh who often has different goals than I do, my expectations constantly led to disappointment and more reason to berate myself. I now limit expectations to things that really have to be done on a given day and even with these, I try to take a don't-sweat-the-small-stuff approach.<br><br>The third reason I have more peace without the list is my hobbies have become just that. With AF in particular, I didn't feel as free to just let some things go for the time being. In other words, if I saw "play piano" on the list long enough, I felt I had to do it or I was saying I didn't care about piano. Now if I don't feel like playing, I just don't. When I do, I do. I don't think about why I'm not playing like I did with AF. Other people may be able to let "play piano" go easily and just as easily add it again; I couldn't.<br><br>A final reason I think I have more peace without the list is because of my new perspective on procrastination. With AF (and also pre-AF), I labeled activities like web surfing, magazine reading, and this post as procrastination. I put them on my AF list to "limit them." If I was procrastinating, I figured I must be a 'procrastinator'--another reason to be disgusted with myself.  Now I honestly don't even think about "how much time I am wasting" in these activities. I get the important things done and so much more. I'm not a procrastinator; I'm a normal, productive person who likes to recreate.<br><br>As you can see, the biggest change I've experienced is in how I think.  The change hasn't come easily, nor has its impact been limited to TM. I'm very thankful for the freedom I have now and wish the same for everyone, list or no list.</div>

<div class="content">Very intrigued by working without a list, so much so I'm ready to try it.  I'm the pastor of a small congregation and I also work closely with a local school board on matters of faith, so being organized has always been really important to me.  I used Franklin Covey; GTD and now I am a faithful user of AF. No pun intended. Anyway, I have one fear and one observation.<br>First, the fear.  What about David Allen's observation about unconscious mental clutter?  I did notice that when I did the "Mental dump" as he calls it, it did feel quite liberating. I note that the feeling didn't last, probably because I was not faithful to the process.  With no list, is that a potential problem?  Am I inviting more stress into my life by wondering, even unconsciously, if I'm missing something? What's the secret here?<br>Secondly, the observation.  I took a sabbatical last year and worked for our government as a contract mediator, that's when I started AF (January).  At that time, something incredible happened, I actually accomplished so much that for about a week or so I had nothing on my list to do. I just kept doing things as they came up.  It was amazing.  That was an awfully nice place to be, when my pace of incoming work matched my output.  Haven't felt that way since, but I'm wondering if I tossed my list I might get that back.  <br>To me, it's all about peace of mind.  Perhaps that comes first - without peace of mind, no list will satisfy; with peace of mind, no list is necessary.</div>

<div class="content">Paul, nice to "meet" you first of all. I couldn't agree more with your last statement: "...without peace of mind, no list will satisfy; with peace of mind, no list is necessary."<br><br>As to your fear, all you need is a means of reminding yourself of important issues that are time-sensitive and that may be forgotten. If it's something you must do on a particular day, give yourself a reminder on that day. I use Google calendar with my iPhone so I get text messages for some tasks. For others, just having an emailed agenda each morning works. Obviously a paper calendar works, too.  If you have tasks/projects that are more time-consuming that you're afraid you won't get to, figure out how much advance notice you need to get it done on time, and give yourself a reminder then. Depending on the task, you could keep reminding yourself daily until it's due. Putting these things on my calendar gives me that GTD-like peace of mind.<br><br>As to your experience of just doing things as they come up, that is exactly what I experience. This is how my dh approaches TM. He is self-employed, extremely successful and self-disciplined, yet able to take a nap and have fun whenever it seems like the thing to do. Before going list-free, he would ask me to go to the park with him and the kids and I would always say I was too "busy." I certainly felt that way with my giant list. Now I just go and have no stress about it. As a Christian I have the added benefit of feeling like God can now direct my day. With my list, I'm afraid God felt a lot like my dh did--that I was always saying I was too busy.<br><br>I'm interested to know how you do! If it doesn't work for you, that's instructive, too.</div>

<div class="content">"without peace of mind, no list will satisfy; with peace of mind, no list is necessary"<br><br>I find that energy surges for TM systems are in direct proportion to creative dry-spells. In other words, barring a compelling answer to "why do x?", no TM system will satisfy... not for long anyway. <br><br>So Mel's suggestion is attractive, the same way an updated GTD system would be. The honeymoon period with AF4 has ended, and I can feel myself lurching for something new. I'm resisting the temptation, because I do believe AF4 provides a degree of accountability, organization and motivation.</div>

<div class="content">But Avrum, if you don't have a compelling answer to "why do X?" then why not just let it go? Do you agree that sometimes we use TM systems to try to force ourselves into doing things we really shouldn't be doing?<br><br>And I won't disagree with you about the honeymoon period. That's why I want to see how I'm doing in another 3 months. I crave change. I would just like to get that desire met without messing with my TM approach.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Paul<br><br>"I just kept doing things as they came up. "<br><br>That works well for certain areas of endeavour.  For example, if you are serving in a shop, you serve the customers as they arrive.<br><br>But I find that even though I regard myself as being very much "up with my tasks" I regularly have a list of 25-30 items that are "unfinished".  Some are tasks that forever recur such as emails, some are tasks that might take a few days to complete, some are tasks that I expect to be working steadily on for months.  The nature of my list is such that I expect that I would never have fewer than 20 items on the list.<br><br>Actually, about a month ago, I contrived to cut my list down to zero items, and though I did achieve this aim, the attempt disoriented me a good deal and I took about a week to recover my sense of balance and direction.  <br><br>I expect that most of us spend plenty of time doing things as they show up, but TM systems such as AF are there to help us when things come in too fast or when our priorities are such that there will always be scores of things that are competing for our attention.   <br><br>Most of the people I know appear to "work" in a "list-free" manner.  But I have to say that many of these people add a lot of stress to others who have a right to expect them to be more reliable, mindful and dependable.

<div class="content">Good Morning All,<br><br>Fascinating discussion.<br><br>Paul,<br><br>>>>  What about David Allen's observation about unconscious mental clutter?  <<<<br><br>The question is: Do you want to make David Allen's personal demons your own?  I mean, fine if you are indeed plagued by mental clutter ... but if not, don't be a volunteer.  If you know what I mean.  If you think about much of what DA has to say, you'll find all kinds of personal "issues" driving his notions.  How many of us are OCD enough to need to use a label machine rather than just write them, for example?  <br><br>>>>  I did notice that when I did the "Mental dump" as he calls it, it did feel quite liberating.

Am I inviting more stress into my life by wondering, even unconsciously, if I'm missing something? What's the secret here?  <<<<br><br>I think it might pay to think about what is really going on with lists.  There is an old adage (well, I'm not really sure how old it is ;-) that says: "You get what you measure."  IOW, if you have a financial goal you had better keep track of your portfolio ... you can't just ignore it and hope it all works out for you.  Likewise, if you want to lose weight, you need to monitor your weight and take corrective action if things are not going as you desire.<br><br>The purpose of a list is to help you achieve a goal by (in a sense) "measuring" your progress.  By keeping you focused on the tasks that lead to your goal and giving you feedback on which are getting done and which are not.  As I see it, there are only two kinds of people who need not have a list: those who do not have goals and those who are so maniacally focused that every detail is in their head at all times.<br><br>So the real issue is not lists but goals.  Do you live in a world where there are things you want to accomplish or do you live in a world if pure reaction?  For a time I worked as a dispatcher ... a purely reactive job.  I came in, poured coffee, took calls for service and dispatched trucks.  Simple reaction.  No lists needed.  I also worked manning a hot line for a computer time sharing service ... I took calls for help and solved problems ... simple reaction.  At another point I lead a team to analyze the information flow within large organizations ... this was NOT a reactive job and so required goals, planning, organization, reports, etc.  Clearly I kept LOTS of lists.  So I would say that you need to keep lists to the extent that you have specific goals.<br><br>NOTE: I'm not making a value judgment.  I feel I did a good job and provided a valuable service in those reactive jobs I held.  Mel had explained why she is in a place in her life now where she is able to get done what she wants done without using lists to measure progress.  My point is only that lists serve a purpose and if that purpose does not exist for you, than neither should the lists.</div>

I see this as a result of not using a calendar and/or not having character. Isn't it true that there are people who have lists and STILL don't keep their commitments? I know plenty of them. Any time someone depends on me for something, I either do it because I remember to or I remind myself. I don't "work" in the traditional sense. If I did, I might have to use an AF list because putting everything on the calendar might become too chaotic. There are absolutely situations in which it would be unethical NOT to have some method of ordering your work.<br><br>That's not me and it's not my dh either. Most of our work is self-determined and self-directed. When I use a list, my brain creates a situation that is akin to having hundreds of customers vying for attention. It's much more sensible for me to work without a list for the most part and use a calendar for everything else. That isn't to say that using a list is a negative for everyone whose situation is similar to mine. If it works for you, by all means continue. My point is that not using a list is yet another option that may work for some people at least some of the time.</div>

I was always thinking I can't make plans this weekend because I have something to do, and then the weekend comes and I can't think of anything that needed doing so I do nothing, and then Monday I remember something I needed to do but didn't.  Writing things down and putting them where I can find them is another night an day benefit to me:  I know what needs to be done, and I can confidently commit to activities that fit.</div>

<div class="content">In the end, isn't it about what *you* as an individual is trying to achieve?  This does not indicate selfishness or being 'peaceful' at someone else's expense - it's about getting on with whatever it is you have to offer to the world ... isn't it?  It's about being driven from within to feel alive, productive and at peace with yourself.<br><br>People who worry about being lazy usually aren't.  And people who talk about being at peace with themselves are usually hard on themselves and not remotely selfishly trying to gain peace at anyone else's expense.<br><br>In contrast, those people tend to pepper their conversations with gems like "can't be bovered".<br><br>And surely, anyone who gets involved in 'TM' (in my world, TM = transcendental meditation, LOL!) wants to *give* something, *achieve* something.  Cheers to you all.<br><br>I thought I was an over-achiever, but I'm tired just reading your discussion thread!  I am a 'TM' virgin.

<div class="content">Hi!  Thanks for your warm words of welcome. I'm into day 2 without a list, so far its fine (yesterday was my day off though!) :)  Helpful discussion.  I especially appreciate, Mel, your suggestion about using the calendar.  I agree, working without a list isn't about giving yourself permission to be suddenly irresponsible!  I also think it is a matter of character.  Obviously I can't rely on my memory 100 percent, so some good note taking will be absolutely necessary, but no different than taking good messages. Anyway, I'll try and let you know how it goes after a while. <br><br>Paul</div>

<div class="content">That's great, Paul. One tip: when you feel anxiety about something and you feel led to make a list, try working on the anxiety-provoking task(s) instead. I figured out that list-making is how I try to cope when really I should let the anxiety move me to get things done. For example, I was feeling anxious about the scheduled activities I have in December. Rather than make a list of them all and everything I needed to do for each one, yada, yada, I made sure they were all on my calendar and reviewed them with dh. No more anxiety. :-)<br><br>Avrum, I appreciate that. I'm so glad that Mark developed AF as I see it as a great balance for so many people. I do wonder what would happen, though, if you stopped labeling yourself a procrastinator.</div>

We are all searching like the graal a system which could help us to be more efficient and painless in our lives. But for me nothing will ever be perfect. Nothing is perfect. All systems just give a little help in our search but the best system is for me Mine. Little by little I am making my own. It doesn't mean that it will be perfect it just mean that may be it will work for me at 90% of my needs and i will be delighted if i succeed. <br><br>What is amazing too is that my system is quiet chaotic and irational for most of it.

I think that what goes on is that they have a system which works for them and is so integrated that it is invisible to most of us.  IOW, why write a list if you can remember what you need to do?  Remember it does not mean there is no system, only that nothing more is needed to do things than to remember to do them.  Likewise, what is the point of a calendar if you remember your appointments?  Why have a system of motivational tools or procedures to beat procrastination ... if you are well motivated and don't procrastinate?

<div class="content">Mike, you are quite right. My system when I started grad school was the one I had used successfully throughout high school and college: my memory. I just knew what needed to be done and I did it. That system didn't work in grad school. That system doesn't work now either as far as my calendar is concerned. But it does work for everything else. I don't need to put "clean out car," "buy Christmas gifts for co-op kids," or "make chili for cook-off" on a list. I just know I need to do them and I will get them done. <br><br>One issue I don't think we've fully addressed is enjoyment. Do you enjoy your TM system? If not, I would argue that it's likely to go the way of the diet and exercise programs you hated. Some can force themselves to do things they hate long-term, but that doesn't mean they should. The best way to make sure that something becomes a permanent way of life is to choose something that not only works, but that you enjoy. I really enjoyed the game aspect of AF. That's why I used it as long as I did. Unfortunately, I started feeling it was a game I couldn't "win." Maybe there's a solution to that? In the same vein, I started doing a Cardio Tennis class. You do tennis drills and games in such a way that you feel like your lungs are going to explode. :-) I find it so fun and challenging that I push myself 5 times harder than I do on any exercise machine. Hope everyone is enjoying GED.</div>

Alas, one has to jump over hoops to make them work with AF.

<div class="content">Avrum, aesthetics are never enough to motivate me long-term. I used to change my iPhone app like I change clothes. ;-) It's a nice feeling not to be messing with that anymore. <br><br>Jacqueline, as usual, you have a fabulous idea. I wonder how it would work with a much shorter list as we probably don't have gobs and gobs of tasks we're actively resisting. If you try it, let us know how it goes. I also completely agree with you about doing things right away. One of the things that resonated with me from DIT was the idea that incoming work can disrupt our focus. I get that. But I also find that writing everything down to be done "later" can feed procrastination. Some tasks are better done without spending too much time thinking about them, right?<br><br>Norman, nice to hear from you and thanks. I'm sure I've explained it here somewhere, but to be succinct, I just do whatever stands out to me without using a list. Things that have a deadline (even if it's just a socially accepted one), I had to my calendar with enough time to finish if I don't get to it using my no-list method. I try not to figure out what I'm going to do next until my current task is finished. I try not to have too many expectations of my day aside from time-sensitive tasks. The few times I've really been uncertain what to do next (I'm surprised how rarely that happens), I pray about it. We're all so different, so I am not trying to tell anyone that what I'm doing will work for them. I don't even know if it will keep working for *me.* But for now it is and I'm thankful.</div>

<div class="content">Sometimes I wonder if the whole TM thing has more to do with the times we live in.  IOW, when I reflect on my system it seems to me that I need it because I've made my life more complicated than it needs to be.  Along the lines Mel has been talking about, I think it is easier to use "no system" if we have fewer goals and they are more powerful so that they pull us along.<br><br>Some of the more well known people seem to illustrate this.  Thomas Edison seems to have been a bit monomaniacal.  He would "forget" to do most of the "normal" things that people automatically and naturally do, yet worked like a mad man on his projects.  I'm pretty sure that he did not have a TO DO list with items like "invent light bulb" on it.  He knew what he wanted to do and did it to the exclusion of almost everything else.  Did he need a TM system?  I guess it depends.  He surely forgot to remember birthdays ... but he did not care.  So what does that mean?  I guess you don't need a system if you are happy with the results you are getting, even if others call you disorganized.  I'm quite sure that TE looked disorganized to most people who did not grasp what was important to him.<br><br>Ben Franklin, on the other hand, while he was highly productive, seems to have wanted to continually improve himself so I guess he probably felt he was always in uncharted waters.  His famous "virtues system" seems to indicate that he felt he needed a system in that area of his life so that he would keep focused on doing what did NOT come naturally.<br><br>The famous Charles Schwab story (which popularized the basic prioritized To Do list) indicates to me that people who have a lot of different things to do to achieve a goal (like most business executives) seem to be more likely to need a formal TM system, just because they don't do the same kinds of tasks every day.<br><br>The way I think about this is to look at the results.  If we want to do things then we either do them naturally or not.  If not, then we need to construct some kind of "ritual" to help us do what does not come naturally to us.  That ritual is what we call a time management system.  I think this view explains what there are so many systems and wars among advocates.  How can there possibly be a single "best" system if the whole point is to help us do what we don't do naturally?  What is "natural"?  Certainly that can't be a universal.  What seems easy and natural to me probably seems difficult and convoluted to others.<br><br>I,and some others (Avrum, I think) have commented on the OCDishness of GtD.  Is that really surprising?  The founder of that system was simply passing along what worked for him and if you read between the lines he does express concerns about his memory, his anxiety over not doing everything, and seems a bit OCD in his habits.  So who would find his system a perfect fit?  Others who have the same basic features of personality.  Who would find that system objectionable?  Those who do NOT have those personality features.  So what really is the point of comparing his system with one which works for people who have different personalities?  What meaning would it have to try to merge AF with GtD (as people occasionally ask about) when the systems reflect completely different personalities?</div>

I have my moments ;-)<br><br>>>>  Does that then mean that we are in trouble when we put even those things that do come naturally into the system?  <<<<br><br>That would seem to follow.  From personal experience, I have found it to be true.  It is like the kind of damage GtD did when I was working with it.  I knew damn well that the market was next to the stationary store.  When I tried to build this horrendous system to save me from forgetting that simple fact, I felt I was undermining my natural competence.  I've noted before that when people write everything down because they don't trust their memory, they begin to weaken the memory they do have.  Basically, it is a question of self-doubt.  Use it or lose it ;-)<br><br>One of the reasons I like AF so much is that it is basically so simple.  In fact, it does not really matter HOW you use the rules, IMO.  The basic thing that the rules accomplish is simply to get you using a list.  If you just USE a list you have done the 80 part of the 80/20 rule applied to time management.  We've been through 4 versions of AF and all of them have worked well.  A simple prioritized To Do list also works well.  Covey quadrants work well.  What they have in common is deciding what you want to do and writing it down and committing to doing what is on your list.<br><br>So yes, I think it is a bad thing to look for ways to tweak what you already know how to do ... well enough.<br><br>>>>  As I reflect on what you've written, I am thinking that all my personality really needs with respect to TM are some checks on things like the Internet.

This app takes a voice recording (up to 30 seconds) and then transcribes it and stores it in the cloud and sends you an email and/or text message with the text, which you can then edit, forward, etc..  It is very nifty.  There is a free (lite) version if you'd like to play with it.  It actually does WAY more.  It searches your text for words like "buy" and builds a shopping list of those ... words like "call" and looks up numbers in your contact list,  phrases like "next Tuesday" and builds an appointment for your Outlook or Google calendar, etc.  I've only just started to learn it so that is all I can say about it now.<br><br>The paid  version ($24/year) does even more, especially linking with Evernote.  The neat example they showed was dictating: "Bring champagne to Joane's birthday party next Tuesday".

The rules are simple but need to be practiced and then continually used to keep you sharp.  There is a lot of material on the web and many good books almost all of which say the same thing -- some better than others as far as explaining it well.<br><br>It all breaks down to two general areas:<br><br>Rules of Memory<br>Specific Systems<br><br>As to the rules, they are things such as paying attention, having the intent to remember, focusing on what you are hearing/seeing, reviewing the material soon and frequently, using exaggeration and multi-sensory associations, etc.  These are all used in various combination to make up the specific systems.<br><br>The specific systems generally fall into a couple of major groups.  Those using "pegs" for association and those using locations (called "loci" systems, such as the so called"journey" systems or "Roman Rooms".)<br><br>Beyond that the systems differ mostly in the details (such as which pegs work best for which kinds of things or how best to construct a "journey".)<br><br>My original teacher used to memorize Time magazine each week.  He would use it as a sales tool asking people to tell him the page number then he would give back the title of a story and the details.  As an exercise, he would memorize the serial number of a $20 before handing it over just in case he was given change for a $10 by mistake, as sometimes happens.  (He only used that to get the missing $10 once, but that was not the point of it ... it was an exercise.)  Other memory experts participate in contests to keep sharp.  One challenge is who can memorize the number PI to the greatest number of decimal places.  Not useful, but good exercise, I suppose ;-)<br><br>As to a calendar system, I've had a lot of luck building a mental visual Rolodex kind of calendar ... an endless card file going off up and to the right to infinity with Years, Months, Weeks, and Days.

A system is good only if it provides what you lack.<br><br>Excellent points.  But that doesn't mean every system is equally good.  For the obvious example, AF1 is NOT as good as AF4.  And I dare say that while GTD is more thorough than AF4, I could explain point by point how AF4 with a couple tweaks does everything GTD does, but in a simpler way.  (And complexity is why "falling off" is such a common GTD phrase.)  With AF4, if you ever leave it, you can get back in-system in an hour.<br><br>Other simple systems are good for various people but not me.  Going calendar-only won't work because I can't nail down everything to a date and time.  I can't do things only when it comes up, because many things take a long time, and I have to remember to get back to them.</div>

<div class="content">Hi smileypete,<br><br>I'm a "list-less" person at work and pretty much have always been that way (and at home now as well for the most part), and unlike Mel, I mostly work in major chunks of time.  Like today, I worked on one project for all but an hour of the day, the remaining hour was spent on email, most of which I didn't even get to - just the important stuff.  So I think it does depend on the person.  I am that type that if I bought a book or video series that I really wanted to read or watch, I would feel compelled to finish the thing in one sitting.  And I imagine that when I'm done this project in a week, I will categorize my email that's been building up for the week and clear it all in groups of like tasks, treating it like a project.  I just can't stand to have (important) things hanging over my head undone though.  Any capturing style of TM just led to my doing crap that I would automatically filter out as unnecessary.<br><br>So contrary to what Alan said above, I think that's why a system has to work with your strengths more than it has to compensate for your weaknesses - as long as the strengths are appropriate for your type of work or lifestyle.  <br><br>For some things that are daily types of activities though, working like I do can be a PITA, because thinking in terms of these big chunks of time can lead to not doing things that are best done in a little and often way.  So I guess that is a weakness that I'm trying to deal with via routines.</div>

<div class="content">Mike, you do know that you are talking to a former iPhone app junkie? ;-) I have Reqall, but I rarely find occasion to use it. I love all the possibilities in apps like it, but they aren't very practical for me right now. With the right job, though, I'm sure I would be loving it! Sounds like your wife would be loving a Wii. :-) I don't remember the name of our memory book. Seriously. LOL The more I exercise my memory, the more convinced I am that I got a Ph.D. not because I'm smart, but because I can remember so well. I would always out-score people smarter than me on tests. I'm the kind that could see my notes in my head. I would just read down to get the answer. I will have to think about a visual calendar. That's actually a very cool idea. However, I do find that memorizing uses a lot of mental energy that I could devote to other things. So maybe I should just let Google continue to be my calendar?<br><br>Alan, I don't schedule all my tasks on my calendar. In other words, I don't arbitrarily put "clean the basement storage room" on Saturday at 1:00. I only put real appointments and deadlines on the calendar. So I have videos that are due by a certain date. I put those dates on my calendar. I also don't limit myself only to things that "come up." Much of my day is spent this way (I answer the phone, tutor a child with questions, clean up after meals), but I also address things that are on my mind. If I start thinking about the video project, for example, I will spend time on it until I don't want to do any more or something bigger comes up. <br><br>One thought I had about this idea of deciding what to do in the moment. You've doubtless heard the advice that when making a decision, one should imagine that you've chosen one of the options. How then do you feel? Sometimes that is instructive. I found that kind of thing happening with AF, too. Especially with the earlier versions, I sometimes turned to a page that had a task that stood out, but I was frankly disappointed. I was hoping that I would find a different task that I really wanted to do instead. With no list, I just do what I most want or need to do throughout the day.<br><br>Jacqueline, as usual, you make an excellent point. While it makes sense to address only problem areas with a TM system, our weaknesses should not be where we spend most of our time. Sadly, most of us dismiss our strengths and try like the dickens to fix our weaknesses. It's true that some weaknesses are serious enough that they must be addressed. My former bad habit of forgetting appointments being an example! But shouldn't 80% of my time be spent maximizing my strengths and only 20% used to address weaknesses? I'm going to spend 20% of my time thinking about this. LOL</div>

<div class="content">Hi Alan,<br><br>>>>  Nice discussion. So any working system is whatever makes up the "gap" in your personality. <<<<br><br>Well, that is not exactly what I said.  I said that just because you don't SEE a person using a system, you can't infer that they don't have a system.  It could be invisible to you.<br><br>>>>  You don't need a system to help you with what you're already good at. A system is good only if it provides what you lack.  <<<<br><br>Again, not quite exactly what I said.  I do think we don't bother developing systems to help us do what we don't need a system to do.  At least most of us don't ;-)<br><br>>>>  Excellent points. But that doesn't mean every system is equally good. <<<<br><br>"Equally good" in so far as they each are helpful for some subset of people.<br><br>>>>  For the obvious example, AF1 is NOT as good as AF4. <<<<br><br>For YOU!  And that is my point.  For YOU, AF4 fills YOUR needs.  Some on this list prefer one of the other AFs and still other people prefer GtD.<br><br>>>>  And I dare say that while GTD is more thorough than AF4, <<<<br><br>Errrr... don't you think that "thorough" is a subjective thing?  In my own experience it was way too much.<br><br>>>>  I could explain point by point how AF4 with a couple tweaks does everything GTD does, but in a simpler way. <<<<br><br>I would say that 1) AF4 does not do everything that GtD does, and that is why I like it, and B) if you tweak AF4 to do what GtD does, then what you have at the end is GtD.<br><br>>>>  (And complexity is why "falling off" is such a common GTD phrase.) With AF4, if you ever leave it, you can get back in-system in an hour.  <<<<br><br>I could not agree more ;-)<br><br>>>>  Other simple systems are good for various people but not me. Going calendar-only won't work because I can't nail down everything to a date and time. I can't do things only when it comes up, because many things take a long time, and I have to remember to get back to them.  <<<<br><br>Yeah, as I said, different systems for different people ;-)</div>

For example: I get up at 3 am.  I have for years.  Initially I needed a "system" because I was a person who liked to "sleep in" for most of my life.  But then I had a real need to be at work at 4 am for a new job.  After a few months, I got used to getting up early and forgot my systems for working against what was not natural because getting up had now become natural.  So this morning I just popped out of bed at 3 am with no system to help me do it.  Why would I build a system to get me up when I just get up?<br><br>So would you say you need a system that helps you do what you are strong at doing, or weak?</div>

It is just like reading or writing or any other skill.  Once you learn it, it just works.  And the advantage of a mental calendar is that it is always with you, works with no electricity or broadband connection, hell, it even works in the dark ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Totally agree with you avrum.  I think a big part of it is letting go of the guilt that you actually do have to work on or even care about your weaknesses.  That's a big mindshift.  <br><br>I first read Buckingham and Richard Koch and some other guy who I can't recall right now years ago with their first books and it really changed the way I worked and what I expected out of myself.  I'd been totally focused on fixing myself and following a rigid approach before then and it was great to kind of have permission to go with how I really liked working.  <br><br>At the same time, I do think it's helpful to work on a few weaknesses just in areas where it really interferes with your peace of mind - but not to expect too much out of yourself in those areas.</div>

I'd also add "focus" to those other two as a major problem area.  The basic Charles Schwab parable is simply about focus ... write down your top To Dos on a list and do the top one and don't quit to move on until it is done.  End of story.

I have no problems with consistency and follow through with some things and even with those problem areas there are times I have no trouble with them. My mistake in the past has been changing my entire system because of those sticklers. <br><br>And Mike, piano probably WAS one of your strengths. You're talking about a weakness within a strength. So if I work on improving my writing, I am working on a weakness within a strength. To me, that is still focusing on strengths. If I pour my best efforts into tracking expenses to save money, I am now working on a weakness. (I hate crunching numbers, sorry Jacqueline!). <br><br>Let's put it back into TM terms. My strength in TM is diving into a project and getting it done. My weakness is that I like more free time than I should probably take. If I (wrongly) focus on my weakness, then I will probably try to schedule my day to limit my free time. If, however, I focus on my strength, I will get involved in enough big projects (not scheduled necessarily) that I have less time to waste. Actually, the latter is exactly what I've been doing lately. I have to fly and prepare for the chili cook-off. Wish me luck! :-)</div>

She shows me the notes of the scale in C major ... a normal starting point.  Now I have various strengths and weaknesses.  Perhaps I am able to focus on a task and stick with it despite frustration.  Does she help me work on developing those things?  No, she (why is it that most music teachers are women? ;-) finds where I am WEAK and helps me there. <br><br>Suppose that I start to hunch over while practicing the scale.  She points that out and has me sit up.  If I keep hunching, she keeps correcting.  Once I no longer hunch over, she stops talking about that and works on my fingering, or something else.  It is those areas in which I am weak that she is training.  And that is a moving target .. that is progress ... you master something then move on to the next thing.  What was weak becomes strong.<br><br>What you have been saying is that using my ability to stick with it HELP me and I should DO that.  Of course, but that is not what I am TRAINING.  Those things are just part of my suite of "tools".  In the end, I build success on failure and eventually success on success ... then tackle the next "failure".<br><br>Does this illuminate anything?  I'm not sure I have been able to articulate where I see us getting off track.  I guess I'm looking at the goal, not the means to the goal when I think about strength and weakness.</div>

<div class="content">I'm fairly confused right now, but that's nothing new. :-) I think you can't talk about focusing on strengths vs. weaknesses on a micro-level, but more on a macro-level. In other words, spend most of your time doing those things that you happen to be good at, rather than bemoaning and working on those things you stink at. <br><br>Within a given skill you are pursuing, it is true that much time is spent on remediating weaknesses. However, even on a micro level, we would do well to focus on strengths. So the Suzuki method breaks pieces down into doable tasks and then promotes over-learning. We all are most motivated to do that which we believe we are capable of doing. Yes, many of us are also inspired by challenge. That is why I continue to pursue tennis. But the matchings I have each week are such that the competition isn't too hard for me. If it were, I'm quite sure I would quit! <br><br>I am rambling and will stop now and do what comes easier. :-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mel,<br><br>>>>  I'm fairly confused right now, but that's nothing new. :-) I think you can't talk about focusing on strengths vs. weaknesses on a micro-level, but more on a macro-level.

I mean, I was not even considering "bemoaning" and doing what I "stink at".  I was considering learning and developing.  Of course, if you are bitching about a thing you probably ought to consider if you should be doing it at all.  If you are incompetent at a thing, then you need to either improve (develop skill) or decide not to do it at all.  No disagreement there.<br><br>>>>  Within a given skill you are pursuing, it is true that much time is spent on remediating weaknesses. However, even on a micro level, we would do well to focus on strengths. So the Suzuki method breaks pieces down into doable tasks and then promotes over-learning. <<<<br><br>Yes, chunking a task down to a size that is small enough to accomplish poorly is the first step.  Then the next step is to learn to do that small chunk well.  I don't see that as focusing on strength, however.  By deffinition you are not "strong" in the task of playing a C major scale until you work on it.  Then you are not strong at controling the volume to keep the notes even, until you focus on that AFTER getting the notes and fingering down.  It is a process of working on what you do NOT do well until you do it well, then adding just a small bit of complexity or difficulty to make the task one at which you are only slightly incompetent, and then learning to become competent.<br><br>The steps in mastery of anything are well known, I think:<br><br>1) Unconscious Incompetence<br>2) Conscious Incompetence<br>3) Conscious Competence<br>4) Unconscious Competence<br>5) Add complexity until you are back at step #1<br><br>Even a child trying to tie a shoe lace the first time goes through those first steps.  Remember how the tongue has to be held just the right way and 100% concentration goes into manipulating the laces into the complex shape with not fully controlled fingers, following all of those rules about rabbits around trees and down holes?  The child is certainly incompetent and working at what she is weak at ... until one day she is out the door in a flash.  Then it becomes all about how to put those feet on the peddles of a bike and ... etc.<br><br>>>>  We all are most motivated to do that which we believe we are capable of doing. <<<<br><br>But is not motivation a different issue?  Certainly a child is not well motivated to tie shoe laces.  The child has to be manipulated, in most cases.  Even so, the child IS capable of the task but not just yet.  And that is the thing, I KNOW I can play the paino ... but not yet.  I must FIRST find out the way it is done and build the skill.  I am well motivated EVEN THOUGH I am not, at this moment, able to play the minute waltz ... and won't be able to for a couple of years.<br><br>>>>  Yes, many of us are also inspired by challenge. <<<<br><br>Yeah, but I think that is just plain sick!  ROTF ;-)  True, some of us like to accomplish things.  I think I went into computer science for many reasons ... but one of them is that I love to solve puzzles.  I get frustrated by puzzles but getting past the frustration and solving them is a big thrill.  (BTW, oddly I think one of my other big reasons I got into computer science is that I loved my Lionel train set as a kid.  Playing with trains is all about programming switches to make the train go where you want it to.  LOL ;-)<br><br>>>>  That is why I continue to pursue tennis. But the matchings I have each week are such that the competition isn't too hard for me. If it were, I'm quite sure I would quit!  <<<<br><br>Of course!  The tasks need to be chunked down.<br><br>Spaking of tennis... I'm this close to the Wii now.  I will probably pick up a system today and wrap it up to give to my wife next week.  My brother-in-law called to ask what to get his sister for Xmas and I suggested that I'd get the Wii system and he could get her the Wii Fit package.  I'm sure she will love that.  But who knows.  She bought this dohicky that you mount the front of your bike on to turn it into an exercise cycle in the winter.  I fought that setup for an hour and she got on it once ... JUST ONCE!  Grrrr ...<br><br>But the Wii will be different ... will be different ... will be different ...  ;-)<br><br>>>>  I am rambling and will stop now and do what comes easier. :-)   <<<<br><br>LOL ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Mike and Mel:<br><br>One of the things I really enjoy about retirement is that I have time to practise some new skills. For example I am taking German and Spanish to levels that I haven't reached before, and for the first time in my life I have sung in a Choir - and loved it - though I'm not sure that applies to my audience!<br><br>What I've found is that almost irrespective of the subject it's the actual process of getting better at something that I enjoy.</div>

<div class="content">Mark, that just puts a big smile on my face. That is what retirement is supposed to be! Doing things you enjoy that don't necessarily put any money in your pocket. Sing and speak on!!<br><br>Mike, that is SO funny about your wife's bike. LOL The truth about the Wii is that your wife WILL get tired of a particular game. The beauty of it is, though, that you can buy her new games to make it more interesting. And isn't that what we try to do with TM, too? Yes, keep the basics that work, but try a new game to boost your motivation for a time? I love giving people gifts. Can't wait to hear how your wife likes her Wii. :-)</div>

<div class="content">Mike:<br><br><<But the Wii will be different ... will be different ... will be different ... >><br><br>I actually lost 44 pounds in the four months after I purchased Wii Fit. Still one of the biggest achievements in my life. ;-)<br><br>Of course, I also totally changed my eating habits (before it was like 80% Crisps&Coca Cola) and was really committed, so I would have lost the weight even without Wii Fit. But it's certainly nice in visualizing the progress.<br><br>My mother wanted to repeat my success and also bought a Wii Fit. She used it three times. :-\</div>

<div class="content">Andreas,<br><br>Yeah, right on all counts, IMO.  I'm losing some weight by cutting carbs.  But the exercise is necessary so I'm hoping that the Wii will also help me keep the exercise up in the cold of winter when I really HATE having to slog through the slush in the cold dark of early winter morning.  Brrrrrsie.</div>

I'm sure Lisa will love the Wii.  She did hanging in playing tennis until she was red in the face.  She is super competitive!  LOL ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Mel - you've alluded to your faith in God and how this helps you control stress/anxiety, etc. As a pseudo-observant Jew, I'd be interested to hear how this came to be, and how faith/prayer helps you deal with the minutia of day to day living. <br><br>If you're not comfortable discussing faith related issues here, feel free to contact me at avrum AT nadigel DOT com <br><br>As well, we can use skype or google chat.</div>

I dunno, this is kind of a new thought and not well formed yet.<br><br>I'm starting to think that it is not WHAT one believes in, but more that one believes in something.  The mental/emotional state that "things will work out" ... maybe.  I'm a pretty hardened atheist, but I've long observed that while I think some of the very passively religious people have a screw loose, they DO seem to cope well and be content.  I suppose that is what got me thinking.<br><br>For a while (in my project management years) I was working with Arabs.  The philosophical passivity is pretty amazing but it does seem to provide a safety valve of some kind.  Their speech was sprinkled with "Insha Allah" (if God wills it).  While repugnant to me it obviously does work for millions of people on an emotional level.  That can't be ignored.<br><br>I can see where faith (or more generally "belief") takes the pressure off and allows people to move forward where the stress would stop them.<br><br>Just a thought.  Mel?  Comments?</div>
