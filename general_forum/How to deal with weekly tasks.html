<div class="content">Hello, <br>Since i use AF there is a problem i can't solve. I have a big AF 5 pages of 35 items.<br><br>Some tasks are to be done when i which other must be done this week or today for ther are urgent or important tasks. <br><br>I do respect the method but i don't advance fast enought. More as i have so many tasks i am sometime embadded or lost because of them. <br><br>To solve this problem i first tried to color the urgent tasks or important to be done in the week in pink. But it doesnt work very well.<br><br>The secont trick i tried was to copy that tasks and cross it on the corespondant pages but the AF double reading in not very efficient. The advantage however is having all togethe what must be done in the week so that i can't spend my discretionary time on the previous items in the previous pages. <br><br>How do you deal yourself with this ? Mark do you have any suggestion about this ? <br>Thanks for the answers.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jupiter,<br><br>Here is what I do.  I still do a weekly review and planning.  I review my AF lists and see what needs to be done this week.  If they truly have to be done this week, then these are deadline-driven projects and tasks.  While I do enter these into my AF lists, I also use Outlook 2007 for these.  That way I can clearly see projects and tasks that must be done this week.  I then schedule block time for completing these -- they go right onto my calendar in Outlook.  If my week gets to be too hectic, and I have little discretionary time, then I will also block off time just for AF -- again, right into my Outlook calendar.<br><br>This approach provides me a way to deal with my many deadline-driven projects and tasks and at the same time, reap the benefits of using AF for everything else.<br><br>I hope this helps.<br><br>Best wishes,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">David, do you also use the action machine for those tasks you must do this week?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mel,<br><br>Yes -- I forgot to mention this - thanks!  In addition to blocking off time for specific projects, I am finding that using the Action Machine works very well.  The whole concept of timed, focused work on tasks and projects has worked very well for me.  <br><br>Best wishes,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Jupiter<br><br>If you only have five pages of tasks, then I'm surprised that you are advancing so slowly.  I can understand why people with 15 or more pages might have a problem with urgent tasks, but it seems strange with only five pages. <br><br>Personally I would define an "urgent" task as one that needs to be done today. I've never found there to be a problem getting to tasks which have a longer time scale than that.</div>

<div class="content">As I mentiones earlier: I write deadline dates left of the ckeck box and higlight them with yellow (actually this is the only usage of highlightes in my AF book - I don't use a highlighter for dismissed tasks). Every morning I scan all active pages for open items with a highlighted due date.</div>

<div class="content">I have a lot of recurring weekly tasks.  I put the letter of the day of week an item is due/must be done by in the left hand margin  I only do this once it is due that week. This allows me to quickly check what is due that day and check again before I go home.  I find having the letter very quick to scan for - I suppose the same reason an analogue watch is quicker to read than digital.<br><br>You can also see whether the task were really due that day if you don't do them  <br><br>I was extracting these tasks onto another list but started to feel resistance to the list. <br><br>Regards <br><br>Mark j</div>

<div class="content">I use the same method as David, every Friday I scan the list for larger tasks or groups of related tasks that I want to work on next week and schedule them, then delete from AF list (great feeling).  <br><br>When working on scheduled tasks I set my phone alarm on vibrate when its time to move on to the next thing, but always try to remember to add any "left overs" back into my AF list on the new page.<br><br>As a catch all,  I also review my diary from the past week every Friday to see if there are any actions remaiming I may have missed and add then to my AF list.<br><br>Hope this helps,<br><br>Best regards,<br><br>Derek.</div>
