<div class="content">Saw this in Clive Thompson's latest link-laden newsletter:<br><br>https://gladdendesign.com/products/paper-apps-todo<br>"Paper Apps™ TO•DO offers a fun, new approach to productivity.<br><br>"Fill out the tasks you want to accomplish, then roll a d6 to determine which one to work on. Roll again to determine how long to work on it. With any luck, you'll roll a 6 and get a break!"<br><br>They also sell a "pencil dice' you can use to roll the numbers: https://gladdendesign.com/products/pencil-dice</div>

<div class="content">I love stuff like this, but how anyone can have a list of only six tasks, is beyond me.  :D</div>

<div class="content">Easy, if you roll a number that you've crossed out, just do the first item on the next page.</div>

<div class="content">I don't use the random method very much, but when I have, I find it easier to do it this way: <br><br>1. all the items are on a single page. <br>2.  use an online random number generator. <br>3. the maximum number is the number of uncrossed items on the page. <br>4. always count from the top of the list, so that the number 5 generated is the 5th item from the top. <br>5. the list is a closed list, so that the maximum number does not increase. <br>6. when an item is crossed out, reduce the maximum by one, so that the list gets smaller and smaller, and use the random generator again, continuing to reduce the maximum each time an item is completed.  <br>7. choose only enough items that one can complete in one session. <br>8. the goal is to cross off all items on the page. Seeing fewer and fewer items on the page is motivating to finish the page.  <br><br>I find this way easier to implement and complete.  However, the random method is nevertheless arbitrary, and I tend use it when there are not urgent items.  I also find it more useful with items where there is some resistance, or items that have remained on the list for a longer time, in which case, I might rewrite the items on one page. <br><br>Since it is an arbitrary method, I find it effective for a brief time, maybe up to an hour, as a change of pace.  Basically, one is accepting an arbitrary command to do a certain item right at that moment, but with too many items, I find myself rebelling against this arbitrary dictator, and tiring of being commanded.  But, if have a choice to either to do the item, or defer, or delete, and I have decided that I must cross it out, it gives some freedom of choice.</div>

<div class="content">I searched the forum, and my method described in my last post is similar to the method described in Mark Forster's blog post The Random Hour.</div>

<div class="content">I usually reroll if I hit a line already done. Sliding produces long batches of completed tasks, and increases the odds of hitting one the one right after a long batch.</div>
