<div class="content">I'm looking for software that will let me take my mind map and paste it into Word. So far, no such luck, looks like most just paste plain text. Anyone have any ideas?  A picture file to add to my word doc is fine, but finding these mindmap programs limited outside their native environment.</div>

<div class="content">I just discovered that Freemind has a pretty good copy/paste facility.   Select a node in Freemind, choose Copy, switch to Word, choose Paste, and it gives you a hierarchical bullet list (outline) of that node and all its children.<br><br><a href="http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page</a></div>

<div class="content">If its only the image you need with no editing ability IN WORD then capture a screenshot and paste into word as a .jpeg file?</div>

<div class="content">I use a software package called Inspiration which exports your mind map to a Word document.  It also has tons of templates that are useful for business or education purposes.</div>

<div class="content">I'm pretty sure that Freemind has a number of export options, including a picture that you can paste. I'm not ABSOLUTELY certain because I'm using XMIND now. Which has, amongst other things, an export which creates a Word document with a picture at the top and a heading/sub heading/ sub sub heading/ ... for each branch.</div>

<div class="content">Like Will mentioned for Freemind, Freeplane (a fork of Freemind) has tons of export options.<br>Export > Branch as HTML (Ctrl-H)<br>Export > As PNG...<br><br>It's not "Copy" and it creates a separate file, but it should get you a pretty map in Word.<br><br>Also, like Freemind, Freeplane will copy/paste a nested bulleted list into Word.</div>

<div class="content">Sorry everyone, I was overlooking the "export" feature-I was attempting to "save as" and only getting one file type. Problem solved, TK</div>

<div class="content">I use Mind Manager and save as either a PDF or jpg depending on what I want to use the output for. PDF format is pretty useful if I want to share it with someone who doesn't have the software.</div>
