<div class="content">There is a great software package called TaskPaper that can be easily customized for any flavor of AF. I have used it, but since there isn't yet a version for Droid, I am sticking with paper. It is for Macs.<br><br>There is an associated program (the developers talk to each other and coordinate) in Windows called TodoPaper. It's slightly behind TaskPaper, but will shortly release a version 2 update that will bring its capabilities into line.<br><br>TaskPaper has the ability to easily enter in a task and easily tag it with any keyword you want. You can also customize it to color a task based on a tag. I used it to "flag" tasks (according to the method I wrote about in the post entitled, "Systems are losing Simplicity") and then I use the filter function to show only those flagged tasks. I then cycle through those tasks – all others are hidden. When I project is marked done, it drops from the filtered list. At the end of the day you can archive the done tasks, which will remove them from the list.<br><br>It is a remarkable program. You can customize it to any version of AF – though I don't know why anyone would want any other system than the one I proposed! :-)  And, I'm sure that once TodoPaper goes to version 2, it will be just as remarkable.<br><br>As soon as there is a Droid version, I will use it again, because then my list will always be with me. Right now my paper version is working superbly.<br><br>Matt</div>

<div class="content">I'm going to try this out next week when I get back from a business trip. Right now, I'm using GQueues (www.gqueues.com) based on another recommendation on this site.</div>

<div class="content">@Matt yes Task paper is a great software and if you add it with SIMPLE TEXT another free program you find on the web site you will have freely a sync with your ipad or your iphone. <br><br>Another advantage is that the software is saved on .txt even if the  end is .taskpaper. <br>So you can open it every where even if you don't have task paper at your office.<br><br>At the end for Omnifocus users you can drag and drop or copy and past a all list from the 2  software and it works. So imagine you have a perfect  autofocus list on Omnifocus in a context call autofocus and another in a context call unfinished but you dont want to work on omnifocus during the day you can copy the all list report it on taskpaper work on task paper, add what you want  and update all at the end of the day on omnifocus for the next day.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Jupiter, for informing the group of their simple text interface for the iPhone. Sadly, as I mentioned, I have a Droid and there isn't yet a solution for that.<br><br>Matt</div>

<div class="content">Hi<br><br>I'm working in my own AF1 version, it's in a very early stage (very!!), but If you want to look at: <a href="http://focussed.apphb.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://focussed.apphb.com</a><br>Any suggestions would be very appreciated</div>
