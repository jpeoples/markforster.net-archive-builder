<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br>My advice with this system will be the same as with my other ones. Have a separate list for each location - if stuff can be done at both locations then put it on both lists.<br><br>I realise that that advice may not fit everyone's circumstances, but there's no way I can cover every eventuality.</div>

<div class="content">OK, two separate lists (and all the various ways to achieve two lists with one notebook) works for me.   I was afraid your new system might be so "life integrated" that it would be difficult to separate these domains from each other.<br><br>Looking forward to seeing your new system!  :-)</div>
