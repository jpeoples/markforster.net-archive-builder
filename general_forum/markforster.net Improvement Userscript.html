<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-02-19 23:58</div>
<div class="content">Hello everyone,<br><br>I've published several userscripts in the past to improve this website and forum. They're now scattered across three threads in this forum and some variations exist, making it hard to find out which scripts exist, which can be combined and which shouldn't be combined.<br><br>Thus I merged all my userscripts into one. One script to rule them all. ;-)<br><br>You'll only need this single link, the newest version of the script and instructions will always be available here:<br><br><a href="http://andreashofmann.net/userscripts/markforster.net/" rel="nofollow">http://andreashofmann.net/userscripts/markforster.net/</a><br><br>Before you install it, uninstall any of my userscripts you may have installed. You won't need anything beside this script.<br><br>It includes:<br><br>- Highlight New Topics and Posts<br>- Highlight Mark Forster's Posts<br>- Go to Last Page When Opening Topics<br>- Scroll to Bottom When Opening Topics<br>- Open Topics in New Tabs/Windows<br>- Block Esc Key From Forwarding to Login Screen<br><br>In addition, there now is an options menu, which will be added to the bottom of the left side bar and allows you to enable/disable all features in realtime.</div>

<div class="content">Does it scroll to the bottom when opening topics or does it scroll to the first unread post?<br><br>Whichever script I am using scrolls to the last unread post.  It highlights unread in yellow on and Mark Forster i n green.  That's the way I like it best.  Therefore I am thinking that if it isn't broken I shouldn't fix it.</div>

<div class="content">Mike:<br><br>Thanks!<br><br>MartyH:<br><br>Where it scrolls to depends. <br><br>If you don't activate one of the "Highlight ..." scripts and don't activate "Jump to Bottom", it will always stay at the top.<br><br>If you activate neither one of the "Highlight ..." scripts nor "Jump to Bottom", it will always scroll to the bottom.<br><br>If you do activate one of the "Highlight ..." scripts and don't activate "Jump to Bottom", it will scroll to the first new post if there are new posts and stay at the top if there aren't.<br><br>If you activate both one of the "Highlight ..." scripts and "Jump to Bottom", it will scroll to the first new post if there are new posts and scroll to the bottom if there aren't.<br><br>In that aspect, the new script and my old scripts (installed together or separately respectively) behave exactly the same.<br><br>There's one aspect the new script behaves differently: The old standalone higlight script only highlighted Mark's new posts in green. The new script highlights all of Mark's posts, using the same old green for new posts and a much lighter shade of green for old posts. <br><br>Oh, and the reason I say "one of"  the highlight scripts is that it will scroll to the newest post even if you only highlight Mark's posts. I'll fix that behavior in the next version.</div>

<h2>Reply by ds</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-02-21 18:14</div>
<div class="content">I was dense, too--looking for something on the bottom left of the web browser. Once you've installed the scripts, the options box appears embedded on the bottom of left of THIS website! Like magic.</div>
<h2>Reply by Andreas Hofmann</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-02-21 18:15</div>
<div class="content">Joseph: <br><br>It means the last box in the left side bar. There are the boxes "Search", "Newsletter", "Most recent postings", "To think about" and "Login", followed by the twitter updates. The box "Userscript Options" should be below that.</div>
<h2>Reply by MartyH</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-02-21 18:20</div>
<div class="content">It is the left bar on the page itself.  (I scratched my head like you are doing - don't feel bad.)</div>
<h2>Reply by Andreas Hofmann</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-02-21 18:23</div>
<div class="content">Problem is, if the middle pane is longer than the sidebar, the options are not at the bottom of the whole page. They're technically at the bottom of the sidebar, since the sidebar is only as high as the combined height of the boxes it contains, but visually you may think of the sidebar continuing empty to the bottom of the page, in which case "at the bottom of the left sidebar" is confusing. <br><br>Perhaps I should've just said "in the left sidebar".</div>
<h2>Reply by Andreas Hofmann</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-02-21 18:24</div>
<div class="content">Or "in the left sidebar of the website". I forget there are sidebars in browsers. ^_^</div>

<div class="content">Ha! Thanks folks, it was there in plain sight. Andreas, you were right. . . i was thinking "sidebar" integrated into a browser. The whole time I was thinking "Firefox doesn't have a left hand sidebar!"<br><br>Great script, thanks!</div>
<h2>Reply by moises</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-02-22 0:58</div>
<div class="content">Yes, this is awesome. And yes, I also did not see the options on the left sidebar until this thread explained it to me.<br><br>Now that I am using this, I feel that it would be more efficient for me if the New Tab/Window option kept the focus on the main forum page, rather than taking me to the newly opened topic here's why.<br><br>I go to the forum page. I see the top 4 topics are yellow. What I usually want to do is click all 4 highlighted topics. Since I have the attention span of a fruit fly, if I am immediately taken to the opened topic, I then forget which ones I have already opened and which ones remain to be opened. I would prefer to remain on the forum page and just click all the highlighted topics that interest me. I can then close the forum page and start to read the opened topics.<br><br>But all this is petty stuff. The way things are is far superior to the way things were, where I was constantly trying to remember what I had already read and what was new. <br><br>The generosity of Mark and Andreas continues to inspire me. Thanks.</div>

<div class="content"><<Now that I am using this, I feel that it would be more efficient for me if the New Tab/Window option kept the focus on the main forum page, rather than taking me to the newly opened topic here's why.>><br><br>That's something I can't influence, I think. I either let the links open in the same tab/window, or give them target="blank" to open in a new tab/window. HTML doesn't support a "in background" target. Maybe I can find something in JavaScript to achieve that effect.<br><br>What you need to do to open them in the background varies depending on which browser you use. In Chrome, I hold Ctrl down while clicking the links. In Opera, it's Ctrl+Shift. In Firefox, Ctrl alone does the job (I don't now if this is influenced by the Tab Mix Plus extension I have installed).</div>

<div class="meta">2010-02-22 5:49</div>
<div class="content">And as MartyH says, middle-click works for me in all three browsers as well, but I don't usually do that because my notebook has no middle mouse button. ;-)</div>
<h2>Reply by Andreas Hofmann</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-02-22 5:57</div>
<div class="content">Nope, opening tabs in the background is something I can't do. It's something you as the users have complete control over, probably as a protection from malicious scripts.<br><br>Moises, if you use Firefox, install the Tab Mix Plus extension, it has tons of settings regarding the handling of tabs. You can set new tabs created from links to open in the background automatically there (or invert left click and middle click on links, so left click opens in background and middle click in foreground).</div>

<h2>Reply by Andreas Hofmann</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-02-24 20:36</div>
<div class="content">piggler:<br><br>No, it doesn't work in Internet Explorer. There are two reasons for this:<br><br>1. Internet Explorer doesn't support userscripts. <br><br>There exist several attempts to rectify this with external applications (Greasemonkey for IE, Trixie, Turnabout and IE7pro), but even then my script will (for now) still fail. <br><br>2. Internet Explorer doesn't support JavaScript.<br><br>Sound strange, but it's true. While all other browsers support JavaScript (and are therefore capable of running this script, which I wrote in JavaScript), what IE has isn't JavaScript, but Microsoft JScript. JavaScript and JScript are very similar, but Microsoft often has its own way of doing things, so my script won't work with JScript. The only thing that works currently is the menu.<br><br>It's possible to change the script to work with IE or even detect whether it's run in IE or a standards-compliant browser and work in both. I'll eventually do it, but currently I'm concentrating on AutofocusAHK. If anyone want's to take a shot at it in the mean time, feel free.</div>

<div class="content">Andreas:<br><br>I don't think Norman's departure was anything to do with you. My memory is that he got targeted by one regular poster on the group (who we will call M). M took exception to some of the things Norman wrote and started to investigate his postings on other groups. M wrote an "exposé" of Norman under a pseudonym. M himself later got into an argument with other members of the group and left to set up his own group. That didn't last long.<br><br>P.S. I think I removed most of the threads in which this drama took place.<br><br>P.P.S I'm now wondering whether "Norman" wasn't actually M's creation in the first place and he was playing both roles.</div>

<div class="content">I fixed the url in the first post of this topic so it redirects to the github repository of the currenct userscript.<br><br>I have also fixed the highlighting of new posts inside a topic, though it still doesn't work in a way I like. When you visit the index of the forum, it checks for new or updated topics and highlights those. After that it highlights all the posts inside of topics that are newer than the previous time the topics were checked. So it doesn't really un-highlight read posts until the next time new/updated topics are found.<br><br>The script has always worked that way, but I'd like to re-write it to actually track the state of each post. The technology improvements and my increased programming experience over the last few years should make it possible.<br><br>I will now let this old topic rest and open a new one for the new script once I get around to it.</div>

<div class="content">I've reinstalled the userscript from <a href="http://github.com/andreasmaurer/markforster.net-improvements-userscript" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://github.com/andreasmaurer/markforster.net-improvements-userscript</a> a few days ago. And tried again just now. It doesn't seem to work on this  general forum for me. I may have forgotten some things though.</div>

<div class="content">sabre32t:<br><br>Well, your post is marked yellow for me. Which extension are you using to run the script, Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey? Does it show that the script is running when you're on this site? Is the configuration menu in the sidebar visible?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Andreas,<br>I'm using Tampermonkey 4.7.44. And version 2.0.4 of your userscript. It doesn't seem to work. No yellow highlight for new posts. No configuration menu in the sidebar. May be my old userscript settings configurations gets corrupted or something.<br>Screenshots here ...

<div class="content">Oops ... I'm so embarrassed. I forgot to enable Tampermonkey (the icon is greyed). I've enabled it and the script runs. Added screenshots to that <a href="http://photos.app.goo.gl/rfjr9mfj8ce5o8RL9" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://photos.app.goo.gl/rfjr9mfj8ce5o8RL9</a></div>

<div class="content">sabre32t:<br><br>Glad you got it working. The highlighting is far from perfect, and doesn't work with the fvp forum, but it's better than nothing. I find the flow that works best for me is opening the forum index, and then open all highlighted topics in new tabs.</div>

<div class="content">Am I the only for whom the url markforster.net isn't working anymore? I used to use that, but now I can only come here through markforster.squarespace.com. Still OK, but just wondering what happened.<br><br>BTW, the captcha doesn't work anymore also, I had to login to be able to post.</div>

<div class="content">Nicole:<br><br>Yes, there used to be a reverse proxy functionality which allowed the browser to stay on markforster . net while serving the content from squarespace. This stopped working, I think a few years ago already, and now it's a simple redirect from markforster . net to markforster . squarespace . com.<br><br>The captcha is using an old version of the api, which has been turned off. There were warnings about it popping up some months ago.<br><br>Both problems probably stem from this site using a very old version of squarespacce, which doesn't receive updates anymore and isn't really supported. Mark has stated at the moment he has no intention of investing the time and money to update this site to a newer version.</div>
