<div class="content">Day 8 of using Autofocus.<br>I must say today was the most productive day of the whole past year!<br>I had a half day off and worked on my list from 2 pm till 8 pm almost nonstop except for the timed activities of my daily routine.<br>My insights for what they're worth:<br>1.If my list is getting longer than I like,I DO THE WORK on the first active page.Anything,even tiny things-that allows me to cross off the item and move on to other things or another page.<br>I think there should be an attempt to "balance" how much you do with what you enter.<br><br>2.The system "Autofocusses" my mind intuitively.By going over my pages often I know subconsciouslywhat items are urgent and important and I unwittingly strive to get them done-but importantly get other things done too.There is no sense of "should " because I always have choices,and I eventually choose to do the important things unconsciously. This works better than prioritising things and forcing myself to work on them because I find that induces resistance<br><br>3.The obvious visibility of completed items is highly motivating.And all resistance is often lost when I take ANY action-even if it is to rephrase the task into a more actionable form.<br><br>4.I have reminders set up for time specific things on my phone,because I only use AF when I have free time in between time specific activities.<br><br>I have an appraisal coming up on Tuesday and have started work on it.I'm a bit nervous but I'm going to trust the system.I think it's better than my old way of leaving things till the last minute.Wish me luck! :-)<br>Oh and last thing-entering everything in the list reminds me of how little time I have to do things and subconsciously helps me prioritise on a "real time" basis rather than a "one off" assessment when I enter the item.I find my priorities change moment to moment,but I still have sight of the bigger picture.<br><br>Thanks again Mark<br><br>Cheers<br>Jay<br></div>

<div class="content">That's great Jay.  One thing that stood out for me was your comment that "I only use AF when I have free time in between time specific activities"  that for me has been a major factor of AF's advantages. My week has days where I have very little discretionary time and I would normally not have achieved anything on those days.  With AF I can make progress in even a small 15 minute "window".  AF means that I have focus on what needs to be done at all times and can always progress something.  For example I was drafting a letter whilst waiting for my father outside a shop yesterday, and write out items as they came to mind on my list whilst in the doctor's waiting room, time I would normally just has sat thinking "I have too much to do ......"<br><br>Very best of luck for your appraisal on Tuesday Jay - keep us posted .....  <br></div>
