<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-08-9 11:48</div>
<div class="content">I've already seen the older posts on various notebooks, "systems" etc.<br><br>As I've mentioned previously, I'm looking at a paper-based "system" (probably backed up by OneNote, ListPro, as well as Outlook on my Toshiba M700 notebook computer and HTC Pocket PC Phone ) in which I can have my main RAF list plus context-specific lists, errands etc.  The "system" would also have space for meeting notes, wish lists etc.<br><br>So I like the idea of everything in one place and flexibility of notebook systems like Atoma and ADOC, but not Levenger Circa.  My preference is A5, "pocket" use already handled by my HTC.<br><br>Would anyone still using, maybe those who Atoma or ADOC like to comment, and specifically on these points?<br><br>1.  How robust are the covers?  Due to extensive international travel, my notebook has to stand up to the rigours of being stuffed into my Redoxx Airborne backpack or Gator bag.  Could someone send me the EXACT dlimensions of the covers (usually slightly larger than A5 itself) as I have an artificial "leather" Esposita "cover" that can just take A5 by inserting the rear cover.<br><br>2.  Quality of paper, compared to Moleskine, ok with gel inks?<br><br>3.  Ease of printing on laser, inkjet?  <br><br>4.  Any other comments, advice.<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Roger J (at home for once, but not for long).</div>

<div class="content">The paper is ink-loving (says Atoma) 90g/m² where 80g/m² is standard and Moleskine is 65g/m² if I am right.<br>The cover is thick enough polypropylene, although traditional thick cardboard is still available, a beaten look is more 'de mise' there.<br>A simili cover on an Atoma is unheard of :-) , but you can find the sizes on the site <a href="http://www.atoma.be/en/stationary-catalog.php?category=traditional+colours+polypropylene&cat=Notebooks" rel="nofollow">http://www.atoma.be/en/stationary-catalog.php?category=traditional+colours+polypropylene&cat=Notebooks</a> , success <br>Clairefontaine also has (Levenger style in this case) ring bindings, better paper, worse covers and the rings feel 'outlandish'.</div>
