<div class="content">Hello all<br><br>With a kind permission of Mark Forster, I'd like to inform all readers of his web site that we have just released a Windows desktop application 'Do It Tomorrow'. You are invited to read more about the application and download a 30-day trial version on our web site <a href="http://www.biromt.com/products/dit/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.biromt.com/products/dit/</a><br><br>As we have read and learned a lot from your discussion here, you are eligible to use a special 40% discount coupon if you decide to purchase the application: MARKFORSTER. It will expire on 31th December this year.<br><br>I hope that all of you who love Mark's book will like the application too. It was used in our company almost throughout the whole year, and both the book and the application helped us to significantly increase our productivity. <br><br>We will appreciate any suggestion and request for new features or improvements from you.<br><br>Thank you.</div>

<div class="content">Thomas,<br><br>Somehow your post did not come to my attention until today.<br><br>I'm oscillating between paper and electronic versions of to do lists, because paper is easier but at the end always too messy.<br><br>I will try your application and decide if it's something that I could stick to.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Thomas,<br><br>While I can see a great deal of work went into this application, and while I really liked the introductory wizard, I think the application suffers from two things: firstly too much complexity. In all honesty, once I got past the wizard, I didn't know where to start, with a lot of buttons and areas my eyes were looking at.<br><br>Secondly, I want my tasks with me at all times; this means I must be able to access them on my phone. I cannot do that with a Windows application. I guess it will work fine for people who do not want to use DIT only for work and exclusively use PC for their work. For people like me who want to use Mark's systems both for work and household stuff and use PC, Mac and iPhone it won't work as well.<br><br>Also, at least for the people around this forum, I think most of them, including me, have gone from DIT to AutoFocus, which makes a Do It Tomorrow application somewhat less attractive to try out.<br><br>Just my two cents.</div>

<div class="content">Tijl:<br><br>Thank you for your comments. I really appreciate any feedback because until v3.0 the Do It Tomorrow application was used only internally within our company and consequently it lacks the real world evaluation process.<br><br>It's quite funny - DIT v1.0 included only one calendar control, one task list control, calendar navigation and only five buttons. But we needed more and more features and so the latest version looks rigorously different and more complex. Hearing your comment, I'm now thinking it would be a good solution to have two modes, one plain simple mode and the second with all features enabled. <br><br>Regarding accessibility we're currently developing DIT for one mobile platform. We want to enable mobile users to access their data when they are offline too. At least some business users who need all-time access to their tasks have expressed their concerns about web/cloud solutions. But we might start a web project in the near future too.<br><br>As for AF - I totally share your opinion. We did listen to Mark and your discussion here so we were developing a solution for AF as well. It will be officially published very soon but you can take a look at this web site: <br><br><a href="http://www.autofocusapplication.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.autofocusapplication.com/</a><br><br>Although the web site looks very similar to DIT, the Autofocus application has a very different user interface and in our opinion it doesn't require - at least for the AF practitioners - any learning at all. You can see from the picture below that it is really simple, with only four command buttons and one task list panel:<br><br><a href="http://www.autofocusapplication.com/picture/screenshot_01.png?pictureId=8142909&asThumbnail=false" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.autofocusapplication.com/picture/screenshot_01.png?pictureId=8142909&asThumbnail=false</a><br><br>But OK, we'll discuss more about AF application later on a separate forum thread.</div>
