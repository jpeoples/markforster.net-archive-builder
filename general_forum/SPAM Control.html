<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>WAY TO GO!  Thanks so much.  It was bad enough that they posted fresh topics, those were easy to see and avoid.  But tacking on to existing topics was wasting time.<br><br>Thanks again!!!!!</div>

<div class="content">Gotcha.  Well, it will come in its own time then.  Since you did not see it, once, when I posted, I had to enter a sequence of random letters.  That has since disappeared and I have been able to post without the challenge, so I assume that they are messing with it and it will come and go for a while until they have it where they want it.</div>
