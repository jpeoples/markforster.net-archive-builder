<div class="content">Hello,<br><br>I wanted to share a fantastic free site and free app to accomplish your goals through actions. It is called Mindbloom. Let me star off by saying that both the site and app are visual amazing and very easy to use.<br><br>The site is: Mindbloom.com and the iphone app is called: bloom* (including the asterix).  <br><br>Mindbloom does 4 essential things extremely well.<br><br>1. Organizes your life into areas of your focus.<br>2. Creates goals of your choice for these areas<br>3. Creates an action plan to achieve these goals.<br>4. Motivates you to achieve these goals through visuals, audio, and inspirational quotes<br><br>Here is a brief summary of how it is set up: <br><br>-You have a plant. The plant has different leaves representing areas of your life. You're objective is to maintain the health of this plant through sunshine and rain. Sunshine is everything that motivates you towards your goal (visuals,audio,quotes,slideshows) . Rain is a set of actions you must complete to make your plant grow. If you require socializing/competition to motivate you, then you can add friends and build a forest (If you want).   <br><br>-There are sets of actions prewritten for common goals by the bloom community and you can also write your own.  What I like about it most is that its not a boring linear task list where you can too easily jot everything thats on your mind, only to later filter out low priorities. Instead,  from the start you declare your objectives and create a huge action plan.  Also, it balances the motivation, action and focus very well.  The motivation incorporated ‘pulls’ you to do things on your list rather than ‘push’ you.   <br><br><br>This is the basics of it, but there is so much more.

<div class="content">I liked that it gave me a new way to describe why I like Mark's systems: gamification.</div>

<div class="content">Yes. I know what you mean. Especially with Autofocus. Because I generally wanted to close each page. A bit of personal competition is really good motivation to do more. <br><br>With Mindbloom, I can't help but smile when my plant is green and glowing. When it is brown/dying I know that I'm not doing enough. So its time to do more. Also, each area of your life is reflected beautifully by each leaf's colour or branch to ensure you have balance in life.<br><br>Moreover, you really feel as if I'm committing to doing these manageable tasks. The way site is structured is really well done to ensure nothing tasks are unclear/unrealistic.<br><br>In this game, it feels as if the only really way to win is to do more important things and achieve the life goals you set. Prizes to be won are 'action packs' which are basically more goal driven tasks to complete. I can either leave them the way it is or edit them to better suit me.<br><br>Again, I highly recommend this free site. Its not an ordinary task management site. Its completely unique in what it does.  It actually makes you feel good about what you do. Its main strengths are how it inspires you of your objectives and providing  visual feedback on your progress towards them.</div>

<div class="content">I just realized the typos  and grammatical errors in both posts. Excuse them. Too much coffee and not enough concentration :)</div>
