<div class="content">I'm still pondering the clues in Mark's FV slideshow ( <a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2012/2/7/the-final-version-first-look.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2012/2/7/the-final-version-first-look.html</a> ).  (It's a fun diversion!)<br><br>Today I noticed an item at the bottom of page 2:  "To think about..."   I'm wondering if this is a significant clue.  I've been trying to figure out how the list filters out the stuff that's not tied to one's commitments.  And there just don't seem to be very many "grass catcher" type items on Mark's sample pages (at least based on this limited sample).   The items on the list *already* appear to be tied to Mark's commitments.   That would seem to mean that FV handles other items off-list.   And maybe that's where the "To think about..." task comes into play.   <br><br>Thus, I'm hypothesizing that the FV list does NOT function as a catch-all like AF or SF or DWM.   This would imply that there is some kind of pre-filtering that takes place before something arrives on the FV list.   Perhaps the pre-filtering works by first catching items on the "To think about..." list.   <br><br>Perhaps it works in the way that Mark often structures simple projects:   a simple list of things related to the project; reviewed periodically to see if something on that list needs to be done now.   But in this case, the "project" is "things to evaluate to determine my level of commitment".<br><br>Obviously this is all guesswork, but it helps solve the puzzle of why there aren't very many new/random tasks on Mark's list, compared to some of the other pre-FV lists that Mark has sometimes shared.</div>

<div class="content">Yes, Alan's sharp eyes have spotted it. The task is about finding the next quote to go in the "To Think About..." space. Nothing to do with running the list.</div>

<div class="content">Good catch, Alan.<br><br>Now I am at a total loss to see how FV could function both as a catch-all list, as well as a "commitments only" list.<br><br>Maybe the dots don't mean "This stands out" but rather "This is tied to my commitments, it's urgent, and it stands out".<br><br>I guess I will have to wait for the book (or Mark's next hint).  :-)</div>
