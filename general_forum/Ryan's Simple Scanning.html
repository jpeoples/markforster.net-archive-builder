<div class="content">After crashing and burning with New Question FVP, I've decided to go back to simple scanning with a few tweaks:<br><br>1. Scan through the list, doing anything that stands out with the question: "Am I resisting not doing this now?" or alternatively, scan the list for "What am I resisting not doing now?"<br>2. When you reach the end of the list, answer the question "What am I most resisting not doing?" and write it down.<br>3. Avoid adding things, if possible, except under condition 2.<br><br>So far it seems to be working well, but only time will tell.</div>

<div class="content">The third rule seems to be a hindrance from what I can gather over here. It just hinders to empty your head by letting the list catch everything. Rule #2 already ensures you max out the NEW QUESTION for it's usefulness. Due to rule #1 you are already fuelling your intuition with the topography of the list in regards to the NQ, this is IMHO already establishing what you want out of rule #3.<br><br>If you have rule #3 in order to keep the list short, then, well, what is the best strategy to keep a Long List short in general?</div>

<div class="content">That’s a good critique and I’ll try it with just two rules for a while.</div>

<div class="content">Awesome! Report back how it goes. I do like RSS and may tried it out myself at some point. It is very similar to what I do at the moment, which is a daily list driven by the NQ.</div>

<div class="content">So far it's working like a charm.  An additional habit I have which could be codified as a rule is:<br><br> - If you go through the entire list and nothing stands out, that's a sign you need to free wheel for at least an hour.</div>
