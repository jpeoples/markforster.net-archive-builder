<div class="content">For weekly planning, I'm back to good ol' Covey. But I'm still floundering vis-a-vis a daily workflow. Though that may change:<br><a href="http://stepconsulting.ca/prioritization-do-more-with-your-time/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://stepconsulting.ca/prioritization-do-more-with-your-time/</a><br><br>I never heard of the Ivy Lee method (until today). I like the tie-in to values/goals, and the "tsk tsk" for not getting all six tasks done. <br><br>I'm getting to a stage in my life where... not only is there "nothing new under the sun", but the oldies really are the goodies.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Avrum<br>That's a winning formula.  For hard cases like me, I also need relief tasks.  Sometimes either the resistance wears me down or I might hit a wall yet I don't want to totally abandon the MIT I'm working on.  The relief tasks is also a worthy task and it allows my brain (and sometimes my attitude) to diffuse so I can go back to the MIT I've chosen.  The relief task might be another MIT or something else that needs to stay current yet has some wiggle room.  When that MIT is complete I choose another until my MITs are complete.  Some days the MITs don't have too much resistance.  On those days, I can successfully implement your method.....but not usually.  <br><br>I know it sounds like a circuitous route to completing the MITs but the relief tasks are picked off before they also become MITs.  All and all it works for me.  My goal of completing the MITs needs to have workarounds to deal with the resistance.  Sometimes it's a series of small doable steps to keep the resistance levels manageable. If I ignore the effects of resistance, I'll most likely try too hard and frustrate myself and burn myself out. LOL!<br><br>I hope you are successful and can complete the list in a  more straightforward manner than I'm able to do!  LOL!</div>

<div class="content">p.s.  I simply choose my weekly MITs, projects and CI. From that I create my daily focus list.  I don't hold myself to any particular number of tasks.  Instead I try to create 2-4 hours for the MITs.  That's not a firm time block.  It's simply a guide.  That gives me plenty of time to invest time in a project, pick off recurring tasks or knock off early.  (Sometimes my projects don't go smoothly.  I like having extra time to go back to it.  I also like being DONE for the day or week.  Then main reason I wouldn't do exactly six tasks is because they never explained WHY they choose exactly six tasks!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Avrum<br>As usual, I'm not very articulate.  Upon re-reading my post, I see that it may be misleading.  The 2-4 hours are devoted to the MIT's I chose.  It could take longer or take less time than I expected.  More time is used for relief tasks or continuing on projects.  I need to keep current with more than just the MITs I chose.  I choose MITs to focus on in case I peter out prematurely.  LOL!  This way I'm safe because the MITs are done for the day.</div>

<div class="content">Avrum:<br><br>I agree: As time goes on, I find I most often need to be reminded of things I already know rather than search out the next new thing.</div>
