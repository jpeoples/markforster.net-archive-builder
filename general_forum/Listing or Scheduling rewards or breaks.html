<div class="content">This may be off-topic or have been discussed in an earlier post, but I am wondering if anyone has thoughts about listing or scheduling activities which are fun and relaxing.  I ask this question because these long, long lists of tasks can seem incredibly daunting and I'm wondering if and when it is "okay" to take a break, to listen to my IPOD, to have a conversation with a loved one, or just to  go for a walk.  Yes, it is exhilarating to cruise along from one task to the next.  But I also need these breaks to keep balanced. I'm wondering if it's possible to incorporate them into a system.</div>

<div class="content">Your not alone at work I have a task 'Tea Break', if I don't I find the system so good that I don't take a break</div>

<div class="content">I'm definately starting to add fun items - and looking forward to being able to do them without guilt!  And yes I have had to force myself to stop for lunch on the two days when i had uninterrupted AF time!</div>

<div class="content">I have all my reading and all my DVD and BBC Iplayer viewing on my list, plus things like Facebook. I haven't tried including "Mindlessly channel-surf" yet!</div>

<div class="content">Thank you Mark, it is SO helpful to have your input and what you use/put into AF - so much appreciated.</div>

<div class="content">Funny, I was only thinking yesterday that I hadn't looked at Facebook at all this week - off to add it to the list.  Thanks for that prompting Mark :-)</div>

<div class="content">Yes, I have items like 'Go for a walk', 'read', 'tea break' and 'look at Facebook' etc on my list - (though now I've got a separate "during work hours" list, which probably include fewer of those!).<br><br>In fact, I thought that would be quite a good trick to help me do more relaxing and fun things... something I often neglect anyway!</div>

<div class="content">On my  home list I've started adding 'Do Nothing' .<br>But might try the 'Mindlessly channel-surf' thats sounds like a good one, but will probably have to have a timer set up, to limit my time :-)</div>

<div class="content">Currently i have 3 divisions on the page:  Biz, home/away, and NRG<br>for brief boosters of energy.  If at work I skip scanning the home/away<br>section, but still see if NRG section has anything that stands out to<br>guard and grow my NRG.<br><br>hope that helps,<br>Bob</div>

<div class="content">I'm arriving late to the discussion here, but I've been scheduling break activities since very early on in using AF.  It has proved to be very helpful, probably because I tend to approach lists by forcing myself to do what's on them.  <br><br>I realized how helpful it was in an experience last week.  I had just returned to work after lunch (I work from home).  I was on a page with several break activities on it.  In my pass through the page looking for something to stand out, I skipped over them because I had just had a break-- lunch.  But nothing on the page stood out, even though there were several important and timely items on the page.  When I realized I'd left out the break items, the lightbulb went on in my mind.  I went back through the page, and indeed one break stood out.  It turns out that my subconscious mind was telling me that I needed a bit more rest before returning to work.  I took the break, and returned to complete some items on the page.  <br><br>Since then, I try to make sure that I put at least one or two break items on each page.  It's a good reality check to make sure I'm not pushing myself but am really checking in with my intuition.<br><br>Lenore</div>

<div class="content">If I would have an item "tea break" it would "stand out" for me first thing in the morning and I would "work" on it until lunch time.......</div>

<div class="content">M. Romer:<br><br>Excellent suggestion. And note that if you're not at your desk, you won't be sitting there churning out more items to go on your list, so there'll be less work to do too!</div>
