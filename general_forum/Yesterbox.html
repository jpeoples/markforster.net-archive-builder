<div class="content">Also known as Do It Tomorrow by Mark Forster. I'm using Do it Tomorrow for email and discovered Yesterbox recently. It's the perfect name for Mark's method applied to email.<br><br><a href="http://yesterbox.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://yesterbox.com/</a><br><br>Discuss, discuss.</div>

<div class="content">Definitely going against GTD's 2-minute rule. That rule has sucked up more than enough of my time, since often the 2 minutes grows, or it would have taken less of my time in the long run to wait until more people have responded, or once I let it sit I realize I don't really need to do anything about it. I'd even increase it to a few days.</div>

<div class="content">"I'd even increase it to a few days."<br><br>Does that mean you'd be one of those people to whom I send an email, wait and track for a response, then chase a few days later, only then to receive a reply?  If so, you might feel it is acceptable to manage your own email workload by essentially pushing some of it back onto the other parties.  But when the other parties are already diligently managing their own email workloads, your approach leaves a lot to be desired.<br><br>Chris</div>

<div class="content">Chris, I hear your frustration. I'm usually the one chasing.<br><br>From the description of Yesterbox:<br>< If it can wait 48 hours without causing harm, then you are not allowed to respond to any emails that come in today, even if it's a simple one-word reply. ><br><br>Most of my email can sit a few days without inconveniencing anyone. Several dozen emails this week were about moving a single meeting. Most people replied within six hours, and the meeting got moved. My vote would not have mattered. That's the way it usually is with that group. Another discussion was rehashing an old event, complete with old emotions, for the third time. After a day, it was clear that there was no new data, no new plans would be affected, and there was no reason for me to participate (and good reasons not to), but I needed to be aware the emotions were rising again. Many were accounting, that got batched. Some were details, and revised details, for my daughter's choir performance. If I give them to her too early, she'll lose them, and she'll get confused over which revision to use. Three internet newsgroups for hobbies, which again don't need my input. One automated reminder to update my online profile. Three long newsletters reporting on other groups' plans. No one expects me to travel half-way across the country for a concert, although I might watch it on YouTube in a few months.<br><br>All of those can and should wait.<br><br>On the other hand, I quickly dealt with an email asking for clarification, emailed my husband the revised rehearsal times (with a reminder for him check email again early next morning), bought yet another prop for my daughter, confirmed a meeting date, replied to a request for information, and shuffled another bit of schedule.</div>

<div class="content">I'm not clear why it says "48 hours" instead of "24 hours" if today's todo list is yesterday's in box.</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br>"I'm not clear why it says "48 hours" instead of "24 hours" if today's todo list is yesterday's in box."<br><br>... That didn't make sense to me either.</div>

<div class="content">Maybe 48 hours gives a buffer? Maybe it starts from the time the email was sent (possibly 23:59 before you read it)?</div>

<div class="content">Cricket:<br><br>Yes, I suppose if you receive it first thing in the morning and then don't action it until last thing the following day it would help to think in terms of 48 hours rather than 24.</div>
