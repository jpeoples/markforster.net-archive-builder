<div class="content">I read and enjoyed the Dreams book a year ago or so (I was able to snag a hard copy somewhere before the market price went up past $200!).  <br><br>But I had a hard time envisioning how I would be able to follow through on all the details of my life without any lists -- just following feeling and intuition.<br><br>Mark, I know you have many details in your life and many ongoing projects and commitments.  <br><br>How do you manage to stay on top of the details with Dreams?</div>

<div class="content">Doing what you feel like doing doesn't necessarily mean not having any lists. If you feel like making a list or feel one is necessary, then make it!<br><br>Having said that, I find it is sufficient for me in my circumstances just to use the odd reminder. But if I were in a business context, I would certainly need some back-up lists.<br><br>Push Mode and Pull Mode may result in exactly the same behaviour. It's the source of the energy that is different.</div>

<div class="content">Lucia asked: <<Perhaps if Push is fear-based then Pull is confidence-based. Therefore in Push, judgement is clouded - too much adrenalin (from guilt, worry) to think clearly. Whereas the calm of Pull mode makes extraneous distractions fall away and what should happen becomes crystal clear. But how can I combine Dreams with SuperFocus? Is SF in fact (for me, anyway) very much fear-based? SF didn't work for me - continually panicked by the list of what wasn't done. So - for me anyway - should I just use SF as a place to organize information?>><br><br>Whereupon Mark directed her here!  I have to think hard to draw a connection between that question and this thread.  <br><br>I think indirectly Mark is saying to her "SF is not needed to organize information when doing Dreams."  SF is a push-system; Dreams is a pull-system.  Given Dreams, you merely want some lists to keep track of various things you might forget, and the ritual scanning of SF is superfluous.<br><br>It's a tough concept to get hold of.</div>

<div class="content">I disagree. Mark said, "If you feel like making a list or feel one is necessary, then make it!"<br><br>Lists help me remember the individual tasks that are needed to reach my goals.<br><br>In SF, we look through the list until something stands out to be done. If we associate each task with a goal, then tasks related to goals that are pulling us will also pull.<br><br>Being confident I am remembering all I want to do and am making progress on my goals pulls me. I've found that lists are the best way to have that confidence.</div>

<div class="content">Cricket - were' all different. For me, lists were a make-work-project. A lovely way to avoid doing anything substantial. And then I ignored them, felt bad, and implemented another system.</div>

<div class="content">@Alan re: Lucia and Pull mode<br><br>In pull-mode I am expecting my conscious vision/intention to guide the process. Actions have a thought-form and words to coalesce around. This might be called creative-mode. Pull-mode has clarity and confidence. <br><br>In Push-mode I am relying on physical actions to plow, or muddle, their way through. Push-mode is habit, and often unconscious habit. The major habit is to take action without having clear thought, without having clear vision. Acting from anything other than your vision of what lies ahead, is turning around and walking back in the wrong direction. It feels different, subtly different.<br><br>A process I find useful is each day to reestablish overall (long-term) desired outcomes. Reiterate them. Re-speak them. And reiterate the desired outcomes for the day itself. This encourages clarity of thought, and a structure for ideas, words, and actions to congeal around, to crystallize upon, like snow sticking to a christmas tree, or crystals precipitating from a solution.</div>
