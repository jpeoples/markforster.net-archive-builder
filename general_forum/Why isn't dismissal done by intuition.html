<div class="content">I've noticed that there seems to be a lot of dismissal methods. It seems to me that this imposes an arbitrary structure on something that is inherently intuitive. <br><br>I've always considered the intuitive side to be the real innovation of Mark's systems. Why doesn't the dismissal process take advantage of the same ability?<br><br>I dismiss when it "stands out" to dismiss. I can tell you from my experience it beats hands-down any other arbitrary method.<br><br>Matt</div>

<div class="content">Not everyone has the purging gene.  They are collectors, and will never get rid of tasks unless something clearly says they are supposed to.  With practice in AF, people might get the hang of it, after which the rule becomes unnecessary.</div>

<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>In the task management system I posted, WAF (<a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1374056" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1374056</a> ), intuitive dismissal and deletion are encouraged in conjunction with a day-based dismissal process.  However, I think we have to be clear about what we mean by "dismissal" which in my opinion should be distinguished from "deletion".  <br><br>Also, I think this post from the above thread is relevant here: <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1374056#item1374496" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1374056#item1374496</a><br><br>God bless!</div>

<div class="content">@Alan<br><br>I think your argument can be turned around to an argument for dismissal by intuition. I may have misunderstood you, but I think your argument is this: Since not everyone has the purging gene, then they need an arbitrary structure of dismissal. But, doesn't this argue against all of Mark's systems based on intuition? If I carry your argument to tasks, your argument becomes: Since not everyone has the getting-things-done gene, then they need an arbitrary structure of doing tasks, such as write down list of tasks and start at the beginning. <br><br>But, we have seen how easily people have embraced the stand-out principle for doing tasks, which contradicts the logical extension of your argument. I would argue that it also applies to dismissal. That is to say, dismissal by intuition would be just as easily embraced as doing tasks by intuition.<br><br>Matt</div>

<div class="content">Matt,<br><br>the way I see it, an arbitrary structure of dismissal is needed because of the lack of resources that sometimes causes the failure of our intentions. We may not have the getting-things-done gene, or co-workers get ill, the weather could kill our plans, or we may lack motivation, etc. We don't always have total control over the work we have to do. <br><br>If there is no due date, deadline or another criterium that declares a goal as dead, then items would linger on our lists for ever. Regarding those dead goals I either put them on a someday-list (where they can wait for their resurrection), put them into a dated follow-up system or give them up completely.</div>

<div class="content">Gerry, I'm speaking of myself.  I naturally hang onto things.  I don't want to let go.  So my instinct leads to excessive clutter.  A rule like "do something on the closed list or else dismiss something" helps get me in the habit.  It forces me to stop and take the page seriously.  Otherwise I would look at a page, think I don't want to do these things now but later.  Which is fine, except this happens too often.<br><br>Put another way, the dismissal rule therefore prohibits unending procrastination.  It obliges me to make a decision and take action where I otherwise wouldn't.<br><br>This *is* contrary to intuition.  I'm interested to see a system which counters procrastination by intuitively moving you to the decision point.</div>

<div class="content">You know for a long time, I thought "dismissed" here meant forgotten and gone forever.  I think the word itself gives that connotation.  If instead it's understood as "set aside until ready to pick it up again", it becomes much easier to dismiss things.</div>

<div class="content">The reasons for how different personal management systems are structured are various. That creates a feel and a flow of work different for each of them. But there is a universal underlying reason to the creation of every system: People want to be reassured, feel safe/confident that what they do is the best thing they could now. It stems from a purely emotional place. The caveat for this is that things must be compared to one another. So there is a tendency to hoard things which is natural.<br><br>With this in mind, many find it difficult to let something go for it diminishes that sense of stability and confidence in the system. If you are not afflicted by that "condition", then all the better for you. You don't have to wait to dismiss anything ;)<br><br>Now once people get comfortable with a system like AF and the auto-dismissal parts, letting go of that rule creates a sense of unbalance and the system cannot be trusted anymore because it's like having none in the first place. In other words, people leave the hard decision of letting something go to the system (they don't do it themselves). If something bad happens because of that, them it's how they used the system that is at fault, not an error in decision. Next time, they would probably move a little on those uncertain things to keep them alive.<br><br>It also brings people to taking the time to take a hard long look at what is going to be dismissed and why; to readjust themselves and their commitments towards these things. Something that is seldom done in this fast paced day an age. Once you are comfortable and feel safe and secure with a system, why want to jeopardize it's effectiveness and efficiency by letting a rule go...?<br><br>I'm not a hoarder but my wife is. She buys new dishes, I throw the old stuff out :) I'm tending towards the minimalism way of thinking, she doesn't. It's not her fault or mine. My father was like me and my wife was raised to hoard stuff. The roots of these feelings run deep and it is perhaps too easy to try and ascribe a logical reasoning to an emotional condition. And let's remember that intuition itself is influenced by both!</div>

With intuition, it stands out, "It feels time to dismiss some tasks." Then, one can go on to analyzing the "why" and readjust himself and his commitment.<br><br>Nothing you've said is an argument against using intuition to dismiss. Sorry.<br><br>Matt</div>

<div class="content">You are perfectly right Matt, I have said nothing against using intuition to dismiss. If you read carefully, I actually said that it doesn't go against the rules to do so and that if you are able to do it, then the better for you.<br><br>The only thing that I would have liked for you to agree upon is that intuition comes from emotions as well as logic so that it might work well for some and not for others. We are all different and it works well for some and not so well for others. We should respect the need of others and I believe that in this instant, that need is justified.</div>

<div class="content">Let me see if I can be plain...<br><br>The general populace is told by anally-retentive people to "just write down what you want to do today and start with the first item and work till you get to the last one." This is an arbitrary structure imposed onto doing tasks.<br><br>Along comes Mark Forster – the brilliant one (my sincere sentiment). He challenges the commonsense of the anally-retentive, saying, "Yes, write down all the things you need to do and let your intuition guide you on the order in which you do the tasks – do those that 'stand out'."<br><br>In our enthusiastic embrace of this new breath of fresh air, we write down everything we can think of "because the system will guide us." But, a small problem arose. Because of our excitement, we have written down everything – even things we never plan on doing. After a while, we are faced with the problem of those tasks that just sit there and sit there and sit there.....and we pile up pages and pages of mostly done tasks. At some point critical mass is reached ending in an atomic explosion of procrastination.<br><br>So, what do we do? We place an arbitrary structure onto these lagging tasks, boldly saying, "Here is what you are to do in order to process these lagging tasks. It's all here in three easy steps!" As the systems are tried, they begin to suffer the same problems as writing down a list of things to do and starting at the beginning, breeding new method after new method of dismissal. All because of an arbitrary structure that has been imposed onto these lagging tasks.<br><br>My point – my only point – was to ask why would intuition not be the answer to the arbitrary structure of dismissal as intuition was indeed the answer to the arbitrary structure of processing tasks in order beginning with the first.<br><br>I believe and propose that intuition is indeed the answer to dismissal. I don't believe I've seen a compelling argument against it. In fact, I think arguments against it unwittingly become arguments against the entirety of the AutoFocus Systems whatever the stripe.<br><br>Matt</div>

<div class="content">Hi Matt,<br>Looking how I'm treating my almost 1month old Toodledo DWM dismissal process, I think I'm actually using "intuition" to dismiss "overdue" tasks (where tasks due dates are DWM expiry dates). I was using DWM.xls for a number of months previously, where the spreadsheet macro automatically move overdue/expired tasks from the open tasks sheet. <br><br>In both process, I have a task "review expired list" where I would "rescue" or "expire/delete" overdue tasks based on how it stands out. So, my DWM expiry date is just a trigger to review whether I can commit to do the task in the near future.<br>I guess I agree with your proposal to dismiss by intuition. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">A painter may restrict himself to only oil paints and only a certain palette partly for consistency, but also just to make choosing a paint easier.  Limited choice frees the mind to focus on the canvas rather than the paint. <br><br>The following system just doesn't work for people on this forum:<br>1. Write everything. <br>2. Pick And do something. Repeat.<br>The picking is too broad. Some things get done and others forgotten. So we set up a system to manage ourselves. So in AutoFocus, we choose a system to follow, and that system limits us to thinking only about what we shall do, and only considering what's on the page. It relieves us from worrying about what we don't pick because the system takes care of them automatically. This frees our mind and enables us to make choices more easily.<br><br><br>It's the closed list that does this for us. <br>Perhaps the closed list effect is more important than the dismissal rule.  The point of a closed list is to demonstrate progress to the user, by continually making it smaller every time you visit it.  Hence the AF rule is "do something or dismiss the page". <br>If you want control over dismissing I suggest the rule "you must pick something each time. Do it or dismiss it. ".  Many people prefer timed control as in "this list expires in 7 days. "<br><br>and the point of all these rules is to stop worrying about what's not getting done and just get things done.  Without the rule, you must think about them. Your choice.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Alan,<br><br>I agree with some of what you say. However, as it applies to what I'm arguing for, I have some disagreement.<br><br>>The following system just doesn't work for people on this forum:<br>1. Write everything. <br>2. Pick And do something. Repeat.<<br><br>Just to be clear – I'm not advocating anything such as this.<br><br>>So in AutoFocus, we choose a system to follow...<<br><br>Here we are in agreement. I like AutoFocus - especially AF1.<br><br>>that system limits us to thinking only about what we shall do, and only considering what's on the page.<<br><br>I'm mostly in agreement with your statement. That is, we restrict our intuition to what's on a page (or some other closed list definition) and allow our intuition to tell us what stands out. Then, after having done a task that stands out, the list has changed by the removal of an item. Now, this causes a feedback to our brain and now our intuition may cause a task to stand out in comparison to the remaining. We repeat this until nothing stands out. This is a brilliant twist on the typical list of tasks.<br><br>However, here is where I have a major disagreement:<br><br>>It relieves us from worrying about what we don't pick because the system takes care of them automatically.<<br><br>*For me*, this is absolutely untrue for all flavors of AutoFocus - unless the list of tasks is very small. If I am restricted to the current page or closed list only, my mind is nagging me with the thought of what might be on another page that might need to be done more than any task on the current page. Sure, Mark has said that if a task needs to be done, do it, even if it isn't on the page. That's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about what I don't know. For example, perhaps a task having some contingency has been on the list a while and the contingency was fulfilled making the task available to be done. And, it may now be urgent. If I'm working on a page, cycling through tasks, it might be later in the day before I get to the page it is on. And, then it might be too late to do anything about it. So, at that point I'm kicking myself for not having gotten to it earlier. Since my brain knows of this possibility, it nags me.<br><br>I have solved this dilemma to my satisfaction, by scanning the entire list and allowing my intuition identify which tasks stand out. I then flag all tasks standing out.<br><br>Then, the flags become my closed list I work on, cycling through them in the style and manner of AF1. This silences the nagging thoughts.<br><br>But, this isn't the issue of this thread. This thread is about dismissal.<br><br>>The point of a closed list is to demonstrate progress to the user, by continually making it smaller every time you visit it.<<br><br>I'm in total 100% agreement with this statement. However, you then say:<br><br>>Hence the AF rule is "do something or dismiss the page"<<br><br>That doesn't logically follow from your previous statement. It's an arbitrary construct. It is this to which I object.<br><br>Let me be clear. I believe in the principle of dismissal, it's only the arbitrary nature of when it is done that causes me problems. I dismiss when it stands out to dismiss the page.<br><br>>If you want control over dismissing I suggest the rule "you must pick something each time. Do it or dismiss it."<<br><br>I don't understand your statement here in relation to your argument. You don't want control over dismissal? And, why *must* I pick something or dismiss it? How does that follow from everything that you've said? As I said, I dismiss when it stands out to dismiss. That's the "control" I seek.<br><br>>and the point of all these rules is to stop worrying about what's not getting done and just get things done. Without the rule, you must think about them. Your choice.<<br><br>How does dismissal by intuition cause one to begin "worrying about what's not getting done?" I don't think about dismissal without arbitrary rules any more than you do with arbitrary rules.<br><br>I can tell you from my experience with Flagged Tasks that I am so efficient that dismissals are rare. So, I don't have the overhead of thinking about dismissal as you suppose that I do.<br><br>Matt</div>

<div class="content">If stuff is rarely dismissed, that means stuff is rarely added which you won't do soon, and it's not a problem for you.  On the other hand, some people get longer and longer lists which lead to trouble, and certain tasks are put off incessantly which isn't good either.  The rule is for this.<br><br><<<br>>If you want control over dismissing I suggest the rule "you must pick something each time.

If you drop all rules related to dismissing, then it's up to you to stay on top of that.  It's just easier if I think about only what to do next, rather than simultaneously thinking about whether I want to drop something.<br><br>Having said that, I think I you agree that <br>- a short list is easier to follow than a long list<br>- a list is shorter if you take charge and dismiss things early<br>- if you are doing this, you don't need a rule<br><br>So I'm saying, a rule is helpful where intuition doesn't dismiss stuff quickly enough.

<div class="content">You have assumed wrongly. I do have procrastination issues. And, they are compounded by arbitrary rules, such as, "Just write down what you need to do each day." I had problems with that my whole life. I would "turn over a new leaf" and begin the structure of making daily to do lists. That would last maybe a month.

I find that the artificial dismissal process causes me consternation as I began to dread the forced dismissal as I would see it coming.

<div class="content">In practice, in using DWM, I always have "dismissed by intuition".<br><br>I have a couple of different folders of tasks in Outlook, each of them organized by DWM due date.<br><br>One of the folders is for "misc" tasks -- stuff that may or may not need to be done.  When I write something here, I already know ahead of time that nobody is going to be asking me about those things (no commitment to other people is involved), and that the task is not required for my most important work.   This is a good place for those ideas that pop into my head that seem compelling at the moment but 95% of the time amount to nothing.   For this list, when an item passes the DWM due date, it just drops off the list and I never see it again and it doesn't matter.<br><br>But for my "maintenance" / recurring items, and for my "hotlist" of important things that are key to my work, the items might hit their due date, but they don't disappear.  Instead, they "turn red" (Outlook is configured to display them in red text).   Then I can scan those items and check what's going on.   Often I find that I already did the item "off list", so I can just check it off.   In other cases, the item has lost its importance and it's OK just to delete it or move it to the "misc" list.   In other cases I realize I dropped the ball and I need to take action, so I keep the item there till I actually take action.  <br><br>So, for those last two lists, dismissal occurs "by intuition" -- ie., I don't always force myself to strictly follow the DWM rules, because there are usually legitimate reasons for breaking the rules sometime.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim,<br><br>I'm confused. Your second to last paragraph seems to describe an electronic version of DWM dismissal that is anything but intuitive. When the item turns red (hits the DWM dismissal time), you do one of the following: 1) find you've already done it, 2) find that the item has lost importance, or 3) realize you need to take action.<br><br>Isn't that exactly DWM? And, wasn't it forced on you by date, i.e., the redness of the task in your electronic version of DWM? I fail to see how that is "by intuition."<br><br>Perhaps you're confusing intuition with the mental process of deciding what to do with a task once you are forced into the decision-making process  by the time element of DWM. Maybe that's what you are calling intuition. Regardless, what you describe is different from what I was proposing.<br><br>What I proposed was that you go through the mental process ONLY when it stands out to do so, not by an arbitrary date or an arbitrary "I went through the closed list without doing anything."<br><br>Matt</div>
