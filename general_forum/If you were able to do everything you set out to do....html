<div class="content">If you were able to do everything you set out to do how would your life be different?<br><br>My answer:<br><br>- I'd be a lot fitter physically<br>- I'd actually be reasonably fluent in several of the foreign languages I keep dabbling in<br><br>And if both of those were the case, I think a whole world of interesting opportunities would have opened up for me.</div>

<div class="content">Raise kids who are good people and are able to do everything they set out to. As good citizens, they would only set out to do good things, and that would include empowering other good people to... Nice ripple effect. You know what, it doesn't have to start with my kids. I'd be a good person and empower others...<br><br>Physically fit. Rescue all three of my guilds that are fading. Provide a good home for the kids (which is part of the above goal, see above). Contribute to the family income.<br><br>The buck stops here, without committing to too much or being taken advantage of.</div>

<div class="content">I'd be dipping in and out of a job I felt proud of, working only part-time, living in a house I felt proud of, feeling I'd supported my wife and children properly, and have enough time and money and drive to follow more of life's limitless opportunites.</div>

<div class="content">A friend of mine who was dying of cancer said, before he died, "If you could go back and do things diifferently you would replace one set of regrets with another".</div>

<div class="content">..and there is a fine line between doing what you want to do, getting what you want to GET and getting what you NEED ( to grow as a person). Loss, failure, disappointment and regret often bring significant changes in atttitudes and values, but people would raather write books on success and achievement of course.</div>
