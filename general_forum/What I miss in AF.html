<div class="content">I use AF-1. Switched from GTD 2-3 months before. I'd say AF works for me better as I feel less resistance when I need to do something. Maybe that's because of AF spontaneity comparing to GTD. Though I'm not so productive my car as it used to be GTD days (don't blame me again here for making calls while driving) as it's impossible to scroll through AF pages. But what I really miss is Weekly Review process especially the Project List overview part. It's a feeling like I don't have the whole picture of what's there in my AF system at a glance. In GTD I just had to open my Project List to see where I go. I even made a project list last week, then read through my AF lists to make sure I have all of them in there. What do you do to feel in control (know YOUR goals and projects ARE in the system)?</div>

<div class="content">Eugene,<br><br>Why don't you just do the review?  I don't think Mark has to tell you it's O.K. to do it, does he?  I mean, there is nothing in AF that tells you that you ought to eat dinner ... but you do, right?  ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Sure I can do it but then it looks like GTD system. If I have to run Project List, Someday-Maybe list ec. then AF then doesn't look like a system, more like a sub-system of GTD :)</div>

<div class="content">Who cares what you call it?  Who cares what it looks like?  The point is to DO what works, right?  In what way would it make more sense if Mark wrote a specific instruction into the rules of AF that you should do a weekly review?  If you need a review, do it.</div>

<div class="content">Then it's not a SYSTEM if it doesn't have all the items to manage my stuff.</div>

<div class="content">YOU are the system.  How's that?  ;-)  The idea is not to build complex systems but to get stuff done.  That is going to be the name of my book and my system: GSD  LOL ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Car: when I start getting many road tasks, I start a separate list of road things. After that if I come across a road thing on my af list I scratch it out, write it on my road list, and write do errands at the end of my af list. But actually you don't need to scratch it off of af.  Only do the scratch-out part when the item is distracting you and you don't want a helpful reminder specifically to go buy milk.  when I see errands, I look at the other list to see if I want to do any. <br><br>Review: I write Review Goals on my list, and that task includes stuff like the gtd review. I do it when it feels right rather than weekly. I also can do part of the review now and finish the review another time. That's af flexibility for you</div>

<div class="content">The idea is not to get stuff done but to get the most important stuff done that gives you the biggest payoff :) Isn't it? So I want the system that's easy and shows me all projects so I can choose the most important one to do.</div>

<div class="content">I'm with you Eugene.  What I posted about grouping stuff out of your af list is the start of getting there. Group project tasks into a separate list the same way I group context tasks. <br><br>My goal is to keep the autofocus list short so I can see everything quickly and know what to do. I think this is just the start. It looks to me like there is a way to get all the benefits of gtd in autofocus with very little of gtd's overhead.  I intend to write an essay on the subject once I have it figured completely. What I wrote above is pretty close.</div>

<div class="content">it's difficult to acknowledge that having 1 most important project on the list and moving through it is better then having 100 of actions. Let's say it's a business project of 1 mln dollars. You do it, you have 1 mln. Easy. <br><br>On the other hand if you're not a manager and have no  subordinates then you have to accept those 100 actions on your list and believe your boss knows where to go :)</div>

<div class="content">Absolutely. Have a very short list of what's most important. Keep it where you will see it constantly, and choose AF tasks that fit.<br><br>In fact, my one and only complaint about AF4 is that it focuses on the 100 little tasks over the one big task.  If you have key projects, you need a means to balance this.<br><br>Mark's answer, different from mine, is to block off time daily for the VIP stuff</div>

<div class="content">Eugene:<br>This is something fundamental. Older task management systems aim at what you are looking for: to be in control. AF aims at something else: to be in the flow of things. Things almost "happening by themselves". Almost effortless. And this is because it works in harmony with your subconscious (or however you want to call it), instead of fueling a constant fight of rational thinking against the rest of you.<br><br>Do I recommend to go back to GTD? No. Because, if you think about it, the feeling to be in control is an illusion. You're in control until something unexpected happens - and this is always the case. Such is life. Or, as any bankrobber knows: Plans go wrong - always ;-)<br><br>With AF, you can let go your firm grip on life - and that's a relief. It needs, however, to trust the system (haven't we heard that a lot a year ago?), and boy, THAT'S difficult when you're SO used to control everything! I have "managed" every single one of my days since 1984 - and I was SO tired of it... without knowing it. It was that tiredness that made me think "hey, wow", when I came across AF.<br><br>Today, when I look at my dismissed lists, I see a lot of tasks that I haven't done - and good so, because they were unnecessary tasks right from the beginning. Only that I wasn't unable to realize it at the time I jotted them down. It was my subconscious that figured it out, along with the AF process.<br><br>So. A weekly review? How about simply reading through your list from time to time? That's simple and does the job.</div>

<div class="content">AndreasE,<br>My AF experience was fairly opposite of yours. I ended up doing most of the tasks I dismissed as well as many tasks that I SHOULD have dismissed which for me begs the question, why use the list at all?</div>

<div class="content">Mel, <br><br>it's another extreme not to use a list at all. It's great to BELIEVE that our subconsious moves us to the picture we made for ourselves. And believe that I will do everything to get what I need/want. And I move in this direction as you. But when you're in a shop it's better to have a shopping list with all the stuff you need to buy. If you don't I bet you come home and forget to buy toilet paper one day :) You could argue that your subconsious wants you to have another new lesson in this life :)</div>

<div class="content">Alan,<br><br>I tell you why I don't have the courage to put only the 6 most important projects on my list. I was trying that and at some point I ended up with: "OK, now I did everythin I can. I can do nothing about it anymore. So, what to do then? And when is the right time to come back to those 6 again???". It's like a feeling of beeing always busy that makes me (and I assumes a lot of people) to put 100 actions on the list instead of 6 truly important for them or their business. Not enough courage... It's where FAITH comes into our life. But when you have it you could through away all your list because you BELIEVE that you would do the right thing even if that right thing is to do nothing or have rest for a year :)</div>

<div class="content">Eugene,<br><br>I don't think I understand you.  And I think you didn't understand what I wrote either.  :-/<br><br>I did not mean your list should only have 6 most important projects.  I meant your list should still have 100 actions.  Next, entirely other than that list, you should post your 6 [or more or less] most important projects where you will see them.<br><br>Keep the 6 as an ever-present reminder of what is important.  <br><br>Now work through your list of 100 as you feel is right.  Pick tasks related to your 6 as often as possible. When that's not possible, pick other tasks. And if you feel like you are going too long not doing important stuff, stop to figure what's stopping you and remedy that:<br><br>- add a new project-related task on the list<br>- clarify something on your list<br>- take action to better prepare a stuck task<br><br>In summary, work your AF list, but focus on the important tasks it contains.</div>

<div class="content">do you mean having 2 lists? Interesting idea. I'd try it. Anyway I'm moving back to GTD as it gives me additional two hours a day while in a car plus I can try to adopt AF approach to GTD list.</div>
