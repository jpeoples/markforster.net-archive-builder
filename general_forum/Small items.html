<div class="content">According the descriptions for the autofocus systems you should go through the list until you find a project that is "workable" and work on it. But how do you handle the minor stuff that sometimes is critical to move a project forward?<br><br>Say my list looks like this:<br><br>1. Write small statistics program<br>2. Contact insurancecompany for a new deal<br>3. Mount shelf in livingroom<br><br>Now sitting at work going through this list I can do 1 and 2 while 3 has to be done at home. But actually to get 3 done I need to buy nails so to get going I need a trip to the hardwarestore.<br><br>So what do I do with this as it not really workable when I see it but still needs to be planned so I go to the hardwarestore when ever I can?</div>

<div class="content">Add a task "nails hardwarestore" at the end of your list and move it to column 2 when it stands out (because you really want to get the damn shelf mounted, or you realize you have some time to go shopping) as a task to be done today (when you travel from work to home for example). Re-enter it in column 2 of the next page until it is done.<br><br>That's what I would do, I think. Someone else?</div>

<div class="content">You could also "attach" the task " buy nails for shelf" to "head for home" or more generally have a list for your car.</div>

<div class="content">I would enter "buy nails re: shelf" on my shopping list which is the last page on a small pocketsized spiraled cheap notebook, which I have always with me. <br>"Mount shelf in livingroom" will be striked though on my SF list.<br><br>If I got the nails I would enter "fix shelf" on my SF list.</div>

<div class="content">Juman:<br><br>I'd put "Buy Nails" as a reminder in Outlook, timed for when the hardware store next opens, and then when the reminder comes up put it as an urgent task in Column 2.</div>
