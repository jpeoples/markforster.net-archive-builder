<div class="content">Hi,<br><br>Scanning my lists at home, not matter what system I use, is one of the most problematic issues for me. <br><br>I use DWM in an Excel file. I've found out that when the list is already opened, I take a look at it and pick at least some task.<br><br>I've been trying something that proved to be quite effective.<br>I use Scheduled Tasks (in Windows), to make my list open automatically at a certain time, when I usually check my mail, or browse the web.<br><br>For those who don't know about it: <br>Open the Control Panel, and select “Scheduled Tasks”. There's a wizard (“Add Scheduled Task”) but it's rather limited. Instead I right-click and select “New -> Scheduled Task”, and give it a name. Double click on the newly created icon, and select the program you want to use. In my case, I select my Excel file, and it's enough. Select the “Schedule” tab, and define when do you want to run your program, and at what frequency.<br><br>You can even open a web page, defining the program like this, if you use firefox:<br>C:\Software\FirefoxPortable\FirefoxPortable.exe "tadalist.com"<br><br>That's it. This is how it's done in XP, but it should be similar in Vista/7. The currently logged in user needs to have a password.<br><br>Hope this helps somebody.<br><br>Walter</div>
