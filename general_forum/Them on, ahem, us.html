<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2012-01-2 6:35</div>
<div class="content">+JMJ+<br><br>Avrum's thread "Merlin Mann on, ahem, us?" made me curious: are there other places in the Web (blogs, forums, etc.) specifically mentioning and discussing on Mark Forster and his forum as a community, and the free systems that Mark and others here have made for us to use, eg. AF, SF, DWM, CAF, AutoDIT, Ping Pong AF, etc.?</div>

<div class="content">Yes, there are at least two email lists and a separate forum which someone set up because he didn't like the facilities on this one. As far as I'm aware they are all moribund at present.</div>

<div class="content">Mark-<br><br>Happy New Year!<br><br>Thanks for making me look up "moribund".  I love learning new words that are the perfect description of something when it would otherwise be much longer to describe.  I agree that it is an accurate description of those lists and forums that I'm familiar with.</div>
