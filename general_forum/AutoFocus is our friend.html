<div class="content">Here is a long article comparing "the big three" of macintosh task programs, OmniFocus, Things, and TaskPaper: <br><br><a href="http://www.atpm.com/15.04/gtd.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.atpm.com/15.04/gtd.shtml</a><br><br>What I found interesting was even though the author goes into to great, great detail about entering and organizing tasks, there's not one single word about actually DOING the tasks!<br><br>AutoFocus is our friend.<br><br>ds<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Absolutely agree ds<br><br>Using Autofocus with a simple schedule,  a simple project management system , a simple digital solution and simple statistics is so simple!<br><br>I can see what needs doing in any format I wish and above all can see what I have actually done - which is a lot!</div>

<div class="content">I Iust had to laugh when I read that ds, it made me look up at all the wonderful time management/organise yourself/life/don't do delegate etc etc that I have aquired over the years which honestly I now see in the same light.<br><br>I am now freeing up some valuable book space by removing the offending items and will be donating them to the charity shop - however I am inclinded to include a sticker somewhere prominent which directs the reader that this is for reference only and if they actually want to achieve they should visit www.markfoster.net :-)<br><br>- Titch</div>
