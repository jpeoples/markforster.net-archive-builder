<div class="content">There has been some excellent comments in this forum regarding Leo Babauta's Zen-To-Done system.  In his latest ZenHabits newsletter, he posted this "Comparison Trap" write-up from his blog.  I believe this is food for thought even for those of us who enjoy  reviewing and commenting on new and evolving systems, and seek benefit from sharing ideas with like-minded people.<br><br><a href="http://zenhabits.net/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://zenhabits.net/</a><br><br><a href="http://zenhabits.net/zen-to-done-ztd-the-ultimate-simple-productivity-system/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://zenhabits.net/zen-to-done-ztd-the-ultimate-simple-productivity-system/</a></div>

<div class="content">Sorry, BKK, I've had to delete the article for copyright reasons as it is too long for a "fair use" quote. It can be read at the first link you give.<br><br>I like the way in the second link he says "I should note that GTD isn’t really flawed, and doesn’t really need modification" and then proceeds to give five problems with it and five modifications to overcome them!</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Mark.  What hit home for me in this article is when I look at all my apps and other software that I was so excited about at one time based on reviews or other people's recommendations.  How they were going to "simplify" the way I really wanted to do things (not complicate everything).  So, I think his point, "Reduce your needs,  and be content" does have some value.  I guess that is why so many like your systems.  It all goes along with the You-Can-Only-Manage-Yourself thing, I believe.<br><br>As far as his take on GTD goes, I believe that he did have some reasonable guidelines in his article, "The Getting Things Done (GTD) FAQ".<br><br><a href="http://zenhabits.net/the-getting-things-done-gtd-faq/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://zenhabits.net/the-getting-things-done-gtd-faq/</a></div>

<div class="content">Okay so the article says avoid loOking to others for how to change your own life because more ideas breed more complexity. Towards the end he wrote<br><br>"Reduce your needs,<br>and be content"<br>Smiley thought: He could instead have written "Reduce your content, and be content".  Equally correct but way confusing :-)</div>

<div class="content">Gerry,<br><br>BKK love your quote.  Each minute spent time managing is a minute spent not actually working.  No system will actually do work, you must.  I also wrote guide to implement what I thought were the most impactful parts of GTD.  I found the A-Z filing system which of course David Allen did not invent was the most helpful part of GTD.  I found contexts a waste of time.  I added writing in one place and it became a system, which I feel is pretty good for most people.  It is free for anyone who wants to download it.<br><br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a><br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">Here is how SF addresses the "five problems":<br><br>(1) GTP* is a series of habit changes. ZTD focuses on one habit at a time. SF teaches you habits automatically as you follow the rules.<br><br>(2) GTP doesn’t focus enough on doing. ZTD focuses more on doing.  SF focuses nearly all your actual effort on doing.<br><br>(3) GTP is too unstructured for many people. ZTD offers a couple of habits to address this.  SF provides a very simple structure and very simple rules that teach you the habits automatically.  <br><br>(4) GTP tries to do too much, which ends up stressing you out. ZTD focuses on simplifying. SF's dismissal feature automatically simplifies your work and keep it focuses on the right work at the right time.<br><br>(5) GTP doesn’t focus enough on your goals.  ZTD asks you to identify the big things you want to do for the week and for the day. SF allows your goals to percolate through repeated exposure and repeated small actions so they take shape over time, organically.  SF also allows your goals to be repeated points of reflection that generate concrete tasks that bring you closer to actually meeting your goal.  Automatically and simply.<br><br><br>*GTP = Gettings Things Planned = my attempt to give a more correct name to David Allen's system.<br><br>Attribution: The leading snippets of each numbered item are quoted from the original article mentioned at the top of this thread.</div>

<div class="content">Here is why I think SF is superior to both GTP and ZTD in regard to the "10 ZTD Habits" described in the article.<br><br>1 collect. Habit: ubiquitous capture. SF works great with a simple ruled notebook.<br><br>2 process. Habit: make quick decisions on things in your inbox, do not put them off. SF encourages the "little and often" approach so your inboxes get processed quickly and completely.<br><br>3 plan. Habit: set MITs for week, day ("Big Rocks"). SF handles these easily and in many different ways.  You can enter them into C2 in the evening at the end of the day, to make sure they get attention the next morning.  Or you can reflect at the beginning of the day on what you want to get done, and enter those items into C2.  Or just put them into C1 on your last page and let the system bring them to the top automatically.<br><br>4 do (focus). Habit: do one task at a time, without distractions. SF presents you with a closed list of tasks from which to choose.  You can focus on that one task as long as you want.  You can focus without distraction, knowing that all your other work is captured in your notebook and will be addressed in a timely way.<br><br>5 simple trusted system. Habit: keep simple lists, check daily.  SF has you checking and reviewing things automatically.  If you need more structure for a more complicated project, SF encourages you to think of the best way to handle it.  <br><br>6 organize. Habit: a place for everything. SF - Yep, it all goes into C1 on the last page.  Unless it's really pressing.  Then it goes into C2 on your current page for immediate attention.  Easy.<br> <br>7 review. Habit: review your system & goals weekly. Why weekly? Why not as often as needed, maybe many times per day, maybe once per day?  SF does this automatically as you actually do your work.  No need for a special time set aside just for review.  If you feel you need more review, you can always enter "review all your work" or "review your commitments" and take appropriate action when that task feels ready to be done.  No need to force yourself to do a special review process.<br> <br>8 simplify. Habit: reduce your goals & tasks to essentials. SF does this automatically and with great effectiveness, with the dismissal process.  No need to go off and do some special simplification process.  Just follow the rules.<br><br>9 routine. Habit: set and keep routines. SF has taught me to offload many structured tasks into checklists that are performed at regular times.  It's taught me to be aware of my time, aware of my schedule, aware of my overall workload.  It just does this automatically.  I don't need to set aside an "errand day".  I can wait till I keep seeing "errand" tasks appearing ready to be done.  Then I can say "OK it's time", set aside an evening or day for errands, and do it.  It happens organically.  No need for over-planning my routines.<br><br>10 find your passion. Habit: seek work for which you’re passionate. This is one of the best things about SF.  It keeps you focused on what really matters.  And it drives you to keep producing results that really matter.  Even if you haven't figured out what your passion really is.  <br><br>Attribution: The leading snippets of each numbered item are quoted from the original article mentioned at the top of this thread.</div>

<div class="content">Reading about GTD on the Zen Habits site (not sure what links I followed, but this thread started the exploration), I was struck by the emphasis on getting the inbox to zero before the filing system.<br><br>This is a case where there's no right answer.<br><br>For many years, my filing system was a source of calm. I could find anything within minutes. More importantly, I could file anything within seconds. After all, what good is a perfect retrieval system if you never put anything in it?<br><br>In the last few years, though, I've felt nervous when asked to find anything. The unfiled-piles (declared backlog and current) are too large. Buried in those are less-critical but time-sensitive reminders, like a coupon for a huge discount on home-repairs we hope to do in the next year or two, coupon valid this month only.<br><br>Often enough, I need something from the files (or the pile) to do something urgent from the inbox.<br><br>It's a balance. I need to keep the inbox current, but also need to do that filing.</div>

<div class="content">I have a pile like that too. I think the solution is to find a large stone and drop it on top of the pile. <br><br>Okay now you can't add to the pile. Focus on every day putting the day's stuff away. Occassionally take something out of the pile and put that away. <br><br>That's what I'm trying.</div>

<div class="content">This is an interesting discussion. As a person with ADHD, I have periods where I find myself incredibly scattered and my poor memory makes it impossible to remember what I set out to do when I start it before I got distracted. So it's natural that I have looked to sources outside myself for ways to manage myself. I always feel like I'm running to catch up, or to learn some secret that everyone other than me knows. The problem is that I've turned to systems that try to emulate the super-organized person.<br><br>I've always loved Mark's work because I've found it to be ADHD-friendly. He seems to intuitively "get" the problems of the ADHDer. The brilliance of "just get out the file" is one example (that huge paralysis to initiating action on projects that seem overwhelming).<br><br>Dreams has come back into my life at the perfect moment. I actually think it has quite a rigorous structure. When I'm drifting, when I'm depressed by paralysis, when I'm all over the place in a distracted kind of way... the Dreams process clearly tells me I need to review my life vision (or my vision for my goal), engage in dialogue with my future self, and think about what's better. This forum has also helped A LOT. Some of your posts have really inspired me.<br><br>How does this relate to the topic? I think the topic is in part about the *kinds* of structures and habits we create and *how* we create them. One important aspect is about having an internal versus an external locus of control -- Dreams puts the control back into my hands and tells me that I can trust myself to be fabulous and to let my magnificent vision pull me towards it. It tells me that by dialoguing with my Future Self, I will learn what kinds of structure nurture me and what kinds kill my soul and make me feel like I'll never be good enough. Dreams works with the best of who I am, the uniqueness of who I am, and keeps telling me to trust myself that I know what I need.<br><br>What's right for me isn't right for you. My email solution is probably not going to be your email solution. We all want a way to get out from under the tyranny of our email, though. And it's good to share our experiences. But ultimately, I have to find my own way. And Dreams gives me a structure that lets me do that. <br><br>Thanks for the interesting thread.</div>

<div class="content">Good post, silviastraka.  You mentioned, “that huge paralysis to initiating action on projects that seem overwhelming”.  I find myself in that situation especially when things are backed-up, and absolutely everything (important or not) turns into clutter.  In these situations, I can’t even think about simple things, let alone what should come first.  I have a couple techniques that are pretty drastic, and resemble Alan’s ‘large stone’ idea.<br><br>One is that I just throw (or put in stacks) everything onto the floor.  Then, I take a bunch of empty folders and label them z1, z2, z3, etc.  Then, I throw everything into these folders, making a rough list with the contents of each one, and put this into a temporary notebook.  If I want to get fancier, I make tabs in my temporary notebook simply labeled 1,2,3, etc. (the second technique).<br><br>Then, I put all these folders in a box which I can put away.  Now, if someone walks into the room, they won’t see all the clutter and the over-flowing in-boxes (fooled 'em again).  The idea, of course, is that I am creating a backlog, which I can hopefully now start on.  Also, hopefully, I took the time to flag the important and urgent items on my quick-list when I was stuffing them into the folders or tabs.  Have to be careful, though, now that this stuff can be potentially out-of-sight-and-out-of-mind, you can find excuses to only handle new things and put off your backlog.  Anyway, sitting down at a clean desk is an attempt to start something when you find your situation of being scattered like you mentioned especially troublesome.  <br><br>Also, I guess if I tried this method too often, it would just defeat its purpose.  The reality is that we already know how to avoid letting things get out of hand.  So, for me, not only striving to NOT forget (or neglect) the backlog is important, it is also important to apply what we have learned and use our basic management skills to not get into that situation in the first place, or at least keep it down to a single stack to manage (instead of multiple stacks).</div>
