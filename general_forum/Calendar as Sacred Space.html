<div class="content">Greetings to the community here, this is my first post.<br><br>Forgive me if these questions are redundant with other discussion topics. You're welcome to link your reply to another thread if you find that more fitting.<br><br>Among many things that I can cite from David Allen's work is the notion that the calendar should be given a great deal of respect. Forster's identified traits for a scheduled event are more applicable: that events inherently involve other people, that their value is coupled or dependent upon an absolute time constraint.<br><br>My question involves depth activities or dates one might make with oneself (to borrow the "Artist Date" concept from the Artist's Way)<br><br>I've very enthusiastically transcribed all the aerobic classes that I'd like to take at my gym chain into an iCal calendar with a 30 min. alert on each (if you're in NYC and want a copy, I'm happy to send it to you). Having separate pdfs or folded seasonal paper schedules in my bag wasn't doing it for me. (Over weight-lifting, working out at home, or just getting on a treadmill, I like the structure that a class gives me. I show up, and I know I'm guaranteed a workout, the teacher directs the format, hits every spot, and the time is used to its fullest anywhere between 30 min for some classes and at the most 1 hour.) Whatever the day presents me, I can conceivably bike to Christopher St. after returning from my studio, OR I can use the local location before breakfast, OR I can use the Broadway location if I've an appointment midtown, OR I can use the Kips bay location if I'm swinging by my folks place, you get the idea. Suppose in this example, my commitment simply is to "stay healthy and get in shape" or something more concrete: "hit 165lbs. by the first of April" (which could be done by eating more wisely AND/OR exercise). I've taken the high-road here, as my mission regarding health is very broad, and something like "I'm committed to creating a body that gets more resilient and optimal with time."<br><br>Thing is, over the course of the day, I have come to ignore more alerts on my phone and my calendar than I actually pay attention to. Whereas the alerts used to remind me of my SWEET (Stop Working on Everything Else Time), I now let most of them simply pass by, thinking "Oh now is clearly not the moment to catch a class, I'll just get the next one" or "looks like I'll take a break at the studio to workout rather than catch one before going home" etc. The result being the exact opposite for most people making new years resolutions: I never go to the gym anymore! If I joined say a tennis or hockey league you can be sure I'd know exactly when to show up for team practice and our games. <br><br>Do you think this general disregard of the gym occurs because the events in my calendar feel like they are optional? (Mind you, I never scheduled my Artist Dates back when I was committed to that recovery process, but I confidently fit one in each week.) Does my current habit then diminish the trust in the system I put in place for my calendar? <br><br>This feels like a general blind area for most depth activities: is that just me, a commitment thing, or an organizational thing? Should I be pinning down my other scheduled events, effectively adding strict times to my other free-flowing activities? In other words, should I respond to lack of attention to my gym structure by arbitrarily adding more structure to the schedule? How, fundamentally, do you create boundaries around appointments you've effectively made with yourself, especially if you're the best person to know if something can be rescheduled or postponed and how well you'll take the news? <br><br>What are your tips for this scenario? Might I invite us to continue this conversation on a separate thread to address more transcendent questions:<br>Can we agree on some certain principles for the use of the calendar, and how might this apply to or be challenged by people who use it for estimations, like reminder or tickler dates? Due dates aren't necessarily programmes or appointments, so if you are using your calendar for ticklers, how are you delineating them from your certain events? If you're using due dates in your tasks, do you find them compatible with the closed list systems that we're testing on this site? Does a delineation between a  "long-term" as an imaginary distant tomorrow and a "short-term" really exist?<br><br>Funny how something as seemingly innocent as putting the gym calendar on my computer can have such repercussions.<br><br>Ciao for Now,</div>

<div class="content">James:<br><br>I'm not sure this is a complete reply, but using the SuperFocus system I advise people that when they put reminders and alerts in their calendar the reminder is not to do the task, but to put it on their SuperFocus list.<br><br>So for instance if you have an alert for "Gym", you can put it on the list as an urgent action and then you have to do it.</div>

<div class="content">Hi James and welcome. If I have read your post correctly you have entered into your diary the gym dates that you MAY take advantage of depending on how you feel, or whatever else is going on at the time. Therefore you have removed the imperative.<br><br>If you want to workout every day, then why not start by doing a diary review each evening and selecting the workout you decide you MUST do the following day and just make yourself do it.<br><br>I could easily fall into this same trap, but when my Pilates class rolls round on a Monday evening it is non-negitiable no matter how inconvenient (and believe me my OH is mad that I won't go out next Monday for Valentines because I don't want to miss my class! - Oh well after 28 years he should know me by now and it serves him right for all the years he insisted on playing cricket on my birthday!!!)<br><br>I don't think this is a diary problem, I think you have just given yourself too many choices. I'll be interested to see what others think.</div>

<div class="content">Welcome James,<br><br>Yours is a complicated scenario for sure.  My advice:<br><br>Take out those alarms! Take them out, except for the "must do" or "will do" events.  Keep the events so you can look them up, but turn off the alerts.  Having them all ring when most are irrelevant is going to innoculate you to their effect.<br><br>I think 1/2 hour is not enough notice to get gym happening.  I'd suggest look at the options at the start of each day, or end of day for tomorrow.  Put those on your may-do list, and get yourself psyched up to actually go.</div>

<div class="content">Hi James!<br><br>It seems to me that the calendared classes are more "Data" then "Actionable" things. As Alan says, you should probably remove the alarms on those. They seem like possible islands you might want to land on in your travel at sea. Having a map of them is important but the critical thing is having the habit to use the map.<br><br>Using alarms for those, you have effectively created a crutch, crippling your sense of urgency on all other alarms...</div>

<div class="content">I think this falls under behavior modification. You can analyze your behavior in terms of antecedents and consequences. Antecedents are the internal and external conditions that lead up to the behavior. If you were to think about it every day you can figure out which are the antecedents that lead to you doing one behavior or not doing it. Someone orders pizza, I eat it. If I take notes in a meeting, I pay attention. The consequences (what happens after the behavior) will either strengthen or weaken the behavior in the future. If I procrastinate by surfing the web, and find highly entertaining things to read and look at, I will be more likely to do it in the future. If I go outside in the winter without a coat and get cold, I will avoid doing so in the future.<br><br>So one thing you can do is first make sure that the conditions leading up to goin to the gym are in place. The second thing to do is to immediately reward yourself for going to the gym. But what is a good reward. I've had good results by utilizing something called Premack's principle. That is, activities which you frequently do will reinforce activities you don't frequently do. For example, I frequently surf the web. The activity I wanted to encourage was to do my work. So I made a rule that if I didn't do X units of work in the day I was not allowed to plug in my home computer at night.<br><br>Putting "go to gym" on your calendar is not a sufficient antecedent to going to the gym. Also there is something more rewarding about not going to the gym. Figure out what it is and you might get a better idea of how to self modify your behavior.</div>

<div class="content">Perhaps the "too many choices" syndrome is also playing a role here.  When you have too many choices, the default behavior is to do nothing.   See article <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/27/your-money/27shortcuts.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/27/your-money/27shortcuts.html</a><br><br>Like Allison said, maybe it will be more effective for you if you remove choice from the equation, and just commit to doing the same one or two classes every week, at the times that are most convenient for you.   <br><br>You mentioned hockey and tennis -- you can bet that the hockey team would expect you to show up for practice and games, and not just whenever the reminder got your attention.</div>

<div class="content">To have already received such attentive responses-this truly is a stellar forum of people. Thank you for your participation and advice. <br><br>The closed list as "sacred space" (ie. I put it in and therefore I committed to doing it for my own sense of accomplishment and at risk of failing at something) is the immediate answer I'm hearing, along turning off the alarms-the distinction between data (reference) and actionable items. If it's any indication that I didn't plan to check these forum responses today, but rather did it anyway, I must confess that a closed system is not yet in place for me. <br><br>For those just joining the conversation, I still need to review the responses more technically and so I will incorporate any more answers that come in; and the next time you hear from me will be because I've itemized "reviewing the forums", along with "getting to the gym" before the bell in my task diary. You got the heart of it, Alison, and I'll get a chance to read the Times article, and look through the rest of the advice.<br><br>I think I'm a good fit for AF4re. although I did see your advice on reminders under superfocus, Mr. Forster: that it is the task that is then transcribed to the list, and not the tickler (I really don't like that term. So why am I laughing?) acting as a place-saver or a proxy for the actions in themselves-I just simply overlooked its implication to what I'm doing with my calendar and these classes. As for superfocus, I'll check it after I have my first systems in place, and they've clocked some good miles. Strangely I love reviewing and play-testing new games, but I glazed over by the time I got to superfocus, and I could probably do more at this point by trying simply starting somewhere.<br><br>Mind you, this sprawls into other things that make it on my calendar, am I alone? How about all of you who are subscribed to group google calendars, microsoft exchange server, or some other enterprise support like Blackberry? How do you distinguish what gets on your shared calendars from the actions? I mean it can't hurt that it says "Christmas" on there, meeting times for each sub-committee, or the day of someones birthday, can it? That's data too, right Erik?<br><br>Here in NYC we have "Meetup events" (which I've turned off all reminders for and delete in my email invitations as soon as I've either committed or rejected them: a testament to my now integrating a closed lists in my emails.), and invitations to gallery opening nights are now automated to a calendar (My studio's in the chelsea arts building, and it's always nice to walk through and see a bunch of people by the time I'm closing up.) Interestingly, I've typically no commitment to making any of these gallery openings (they simply work well with my letting off some steam if I'm working on my own projects, and they can be a nice meeting place). Although they're there on their own separate calendar (mind you they are not alarmed, thank goodness, maybe as Alan advised that would make all the difference) and not formally commitments, I can surprisingly be trusted to check a gallery out, time and convenience permitted. And oh yes, a class that I'm taking, which I did formally look at my physical time constraints and did commit to, has open and optional-practice hours on certain days of the week.<br><br>Perhaps there needs to be a clear notion or principle behind closed calendars? Is this the distinction Mark Forster is making in a programme?</div>

<div class="content">Mark's AutoFocus systems, of which SuperFocus is just the latest incarnation, operate on a dynamic list of things that you *might* do. Generally you go through the list every day, and choose things.<br><br>A calendar is used for things that *will* happen on a particular day or time.  It may include things you are definitely part of, and things you might participate in.  Every day you look at the calendar.  If items for today are "definite", set an alarm if needed.  <br><br>If it's an option, put it in your might-do list.  During the day as you do things you can transmute it to a definite.<br><br>Finally, you can decide NOT to do a calendar item.  Delete it.</div>

<div class="content">James, <br><br>Autofocus (all variants) is designed for your *discretionary time*.   Calendar appointments are, by definition, NOT discretionary time.  <br><br>For me personally, here is how it works in practice.  My basic daily schedule is on my Outlook calendar - when to start work, when to leave work, when to put kids to bed, etc.  I also put meetings and appointments on my calendar.  <br><br>So, first thing, I follow my calendar.   And if my calendar is free at the moment, then I turn to my SAF list.  I effectively have two lists - one for work, one for personal.  If it's "working time", then I process my work SAF list.  If it's "personal time", I process my personal SAF list.<br><br>Outlook reminders tell me when a new meeting is starting, or when it's time to get ready to leave work or whatever.  (It's also integrated with my Android phone so it reminds me, too, if I'm away from my computer.)    So that's when I start putting away my SAF book and call into the meeting or drive to the appt or whatever.<br><br>I also use Outlook reminders for recurring tasks that recur on a fairly regular basis -- like "take vitamins" (daily) or "get trash ready" (weekly, for the weekly trash pickup) or "water the trees" (biweekly), etc..   If it's quick & simple, like taking my vitamins, I usually just stop and do it.  But if I'm busy, or if the task is longer, then I put in on my SAF list.  If it's urgent, it goes in SAF Column 2.<br><br>It's really very simple, but since this question often arises -- when to use the AF list and when to use the calendar and how do the two interact -- I thought I'd describe the way I do it.</div>

Blue for Data and Red for Actions.<br>And Greens for "if I have time" ;)</div>
