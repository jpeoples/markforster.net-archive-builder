<div class="content">Hi,<br>I've just spotted AF and AF2 and being a simpleton I'd really like to see a video of this system being used on You Tube. I reckon this would help a few people and might well sort out a lot of basic questions peeps might have.<br>Could anyone do a demo and post it please?<br>Thanks in advance.<br></div>

<div class="content">Alternative, a few photos or diagrams in a Powerpoint presentation and uploaded to <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.slideshare.net/</a> would be good.<br><br>I would like to see examples of what a typical page would look liket<br>at the beginning of the day,  how the oldest block of tasks is ruled off,<br>and a picture of the page at the end of the day.   Perhaps show the<br>activities for the next day to illustrate further.<br><br>Charles<br></div>
