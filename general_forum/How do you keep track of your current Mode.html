<div class="content">Firstly, thanks to Mark for the revised instructions. I've found them immensely useful.<br>Many a times, during the day, I tend to forget which mode I'm in. If I'm doing a series of short-duration tasks, I remember the mode. But, when I come to a task which takes a long time, or when I go on a break or to a long meeting and come back to the list, I don't remember which mode I'm currently operating in: reverse or forward.<br>Has anybody experienced this? If so, how do you keep track of your current mode?</div>

<div class="content">My spontaneous answer would be "when in doubt, reverse mode". But this would be a problem if you strike the "Change to Forward Mode" task from the list before entering forward mode and re-add it only when you leave forward mode. But then the existance of the "Change to Forward Mode" task itself would be telling in which mode you are.<br><br>Perhaps you could use the same technique Mark advocates for marking the currently active task. When you enter forward mode, make a dot beside the "Change to Forward Mode" task, when you leave forward mode, make a line out of the dot. So if you don't know in which mode you're in, search for the "Change to Forward Mode" task. If there's a dot, you're in forward mode, else you're in reverse mode.</div>

<div class="content">If it's been so long that you forgot your mode, it's probably best anyway to just re-add the "Change to Forward Mode" task and to restart in reverse mode. WIth the mode you probably also forgot on which page you were in forward mode etc.</div>

<div class="content">Siva:<br><br>If remembering your mode is a problem, then I suggest that, instead of putting a dot against a task as you start it, you put a small arrowhead pointing either up or down.</div>

<div class="content">I'm with Andreas using the dot "signal" ... so easy and simple :)</div>

<div class="content">I agree with Stefano. I tried both approaches and found that a dot is all I need. It also keeps it simple.</div>
