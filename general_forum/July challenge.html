<div class="content">Does anybody want to partake in a "challenge" for the month of July?  Challenge ourselves, not each other, that is.  Maybe work towards a concrete goal or goals, maybe the object can be as "simple" (yeah, right!) of working with AF2 every day for the month of July.  <br><br>We can hold each other accountable, check in regularly on our progress, encourage each other.  I think it would be fun!<br></div>

<div class="content">I<br>AM<br>SO <br>IN!!!!!!<br><br>I would be willing to report back daily with two answers: <br><br>1) Yes, I made it through the list once<br>2) No, I didn't not make it through the list</div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline<br><br>Brilliant idea!!!  Count me in.<br><br>My challenge to myself is this:  To stay "on list" for at least 100hours in July.<br><br>Where does this come from?  Well, I have found after 6 months of self-observation using AF that as long as I can say on list all goes very well.  However, I can easily slip "off list" and once I do it is difficult to get back.  Furthermore, like a few others on the forum, I have just spent almost 2 weeks on "AF6".  Just a cold, mind you, but even a cold renders me nearly useless.<br><br>So it is time for a revival.  AF2 is bound to offer me an exciting fresh start.  A return to better health will certainly help too.  And now your suggestion, Jacqueline, of a July Challenge is truly energizing.  My way of reporting back would be to post my total number of hours spent "on list" every 10 days.</div>

<div class="content">I am so very in for this, great idea Jacqueline! I'll decide my challenge and report back once I've seen AF2 (also have a weeks holiday booked so it will be interesting to include that aspect of it too)<br><br></div>

<div class="content">I shall probably blog something similar myself as part of selling AF2 and giving an example of how it works. Over the last few days I have stayed "on list" from the moment I've got up in the morning to the moment I go to bed at night. It has worked just fine.<br><br>One of the secrets of avoiding distractions is to put the distraction itself on the list. So when I a sudden urge to research photos of the Sarychev Peak Volcano eruption, instead of leaping to Google I put "Sarychev Peak Volcano photos" on my list and the interruption is tamed.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-06-27 11:01</div>
<div class="content">Mark<br><br>I am struck by the difference between my resolve to spend at least an average of 3 hours per day "on list" and your claim that it works fine to spend 24 hours per day "on list".  (All you would need to add is "take 8 hours sleep" to reach a total of 24 hours.)<br><br>From what you have already shared about AF2 it sounds like it may might be easier to stay incessantly "on list" than it would have been with AF1.<br><br>Accordingly, here is a challenge someone might like to take up: To stay "on list" for a total of 744 hours in July 2009  (24 hours multiplied by 31 days - for the mathematically challenged.)<br><br>Whether this sounds possible might well be revealed at 9pm tonight Melbourne time.</div>

<div class="content">Jim, that sounds like an "Impossibility" goal - even if you didn't achieve it, think how far you'd come even in *failing*!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark<br>You stated:<br>"Over the last few days I have stayed "on list" from the moment I've got up in the morning to the moment I go to bed at night. It has worked just fine."<br>That sentence TERRIFIES me!!!!  I pray that this system doesn't require that!  My aim each morning is to FINISH the day's list ASAP so that I can spend as much of my time OFF list as possible.<br>learning as I go<br></div>

<div class="content">Learning:<br><br>The system certainly doesn't require that. You can spend as much or as little time on the list as you like.<br><br>However all the things which you would put into your OFF list time are ON my list.

<div class="content">Jim:<br><br>It is a little bit easier to put everything on AF2 compared to AF because it handles urgent items better. So if I'm in the middle of something and I think "I need to remember to ask the neighbours to look after the cat this weekend", I can just write "Ask Jim & Sue re Furzyworzylovekins" down on the list and it will get done next (or when appropriate).<br><br>This is a hypothetical example. We don't have a cat (and if we did it would be called "Cat")</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>no......I wouldn't want to mix my pleasures list (actually it's a totally optional trigger list) with my required work list.  I like my work time to be separate from my leisure time.  If I combined the two, the work would be harder to do with those tempting leisure options and leisure less enjoyable knowing that work tasks are looming.  I like to keep my required work totally segregated!  (especially the scutwork! LOL!)<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">I have found it very difficult to remain on list with AF (though that may say as much about me as about the system).  But AF2 should make it much easier to remain on list, so I am looking forward to trying to make it work.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-06-27 15:08</div>
<div class="content">Mark, if I follow AF 2 instructions, and add each pleasurable to task to the end of the list, I'll never get past all the pleasurable items. On any given day, there's a a gazillion unproductive websites that I like to visit - mostly military, hockey and markforester.net (your site is not productive if I'm using it to avoid doing work). If I keep adding websites to the bottom of my list, these items will always "jump out at me". I'm assuming a measure of self-discipline and common sense is in order while working the list.</div>

<div class="content">>>instead of leaping to Google I put "Sarychev Peak Volcano photos" on my list and the interruption is tamed. >><br><br>Not exactly. Because of the new instructions, you can easily finish the current task quickly, KNOWING you'll be able to do the "time waster" next.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-06-27 15:20</div>
<div class="content">Avrum:<br><br>It doesn't really work like that. There's a world of difference between deciding on impulse to go to an unproductive website (for example), and writing down a task to visit that website. Writing it down brings different parts of the brain into use.<br><br>Also, if you record the dates that you do items, you can see exactly what you are doing with your time, which is in itself a big incentive to do better!<br><br>(Each morning after I've ruled the "dismissal" line, I put the day of the month (e.g. 27) in the left hand margin next to every task that was done the day before)<br><br>Anyway I'm merely telling you how I manage to stay on the list all day, not suggesting that you necessarily have to do the same. But remember that I am an arch-procrastinor left to myself.<br></div>

<div class="content">For the July challenge, I'm setting down my list here of "Big Hairy Audacious Goals" (BHAG's) under the principle that it's better to come close to meeting an outrageous goal than to meet an average one.<br><br>- Write a shitty first draft of a 50,000 word novel <br>- Finish renovating my #2 bathroom<br>- Garage completely decluttered<br>- Earn $10k at my consulting client<br>- Lose 15 pounds<br>- Follow BFL program and not miss a single workout<br>- Clean house for minimum (and maximum) 15 minutes every day <br>- Follow AF2 EVERY day in July, staying with the system from the time I get up until the time I go to bed (even though I like AF condensed + AF as is) - and at work too<br>- Post on here every day (after holiday) to record progress (no other posting allowed)<br><br>ps - I'm going on holiday starting today for the next week and won't be internet accessible (I'm only bringing my writing notebook and my copy of "Scene and Structure" - nothing to read).  Detoxing from reading should be interesting.  :-)  <br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br>Have a marvelous time!!!!!!!  btw....If you drop the Big/B, the list acronym becomes the HAGS list!   It is,INDEED, AUDACIOUS!!!!!

Last night I had a dream about you!  ROTFL  We met in Atlantic City for Mark's first annual AF fest.....then my dream had us in Alaska sitting at a campfire.  The sky was black and was filled with thousands of stars.....We were wearing Pendleton over-shirts and Timberlake boots.....The fish was frying, the beans were simmering......then you looked at me and asked:  Can I reveal a BIG secret to you?  I said...Sure...only the beaver and moose are in earshot.....<br>You lowered your head and muttered.....You're familiar with GTD, yeah?   I said  Well, of course....he's the #1 most popular productivity guru!  Why?<br>You caste your eyes away........I'm the author of Getting Things Done....I used a psydonym and hired a M.b.a. to pose as me.....I didn't want the hassle of a public life....<br>Then my dream poped......<br>ROTFL!!!!!

<div class="content">Great idea, count me in! I'll report back with the number of hours I'm staying "on-list" during office hours. The target is 9, but I doubt I'll make that, unless I start putting "drink coffee" on the list...</div>

<div class="content">OK - I've been a "lurker" for quite some time and just wanted to say thanks to Mark - I appreciate his sharing.  I have been using AF with some success since it came out, although I am not diligent about it.  I am ready for a challenge and mine will be to use this new AF2 each day as Mark has described it.  THAT will be an awesome improvement, I am sure.  Wish me luck and good luck to all of you with this new system!  <br>As a side note, I feel that I, too, get mired in the tasks that I don't feel like doing, but don't want to dismiss... so this may be a big help.<br>Thanks, again!</div>

So just to take a small selection from my current list:<<<<br><br>It is so interesting to see entries from others' lists.  It adds so much dimension to the usually faceless comments on a mail list.  ;-)<br><br>>>> Learn the controls of my new camera <<<<br><br>LOL ;-)  I took my laptop on my vacation ... I always do.  My books and music are all on that machine!  I don't access the Internet, but I have PDFs of things like ... you guessed it ...the manual for my rather complex camera.  On my vacation, I spent a few hours reading the manual again and working the controls to get at least minimal familiarity with those I have not used in a while.  (P.S.  My rather complex flash unit as well)<br><br>>>> Spanish lesson 29 <<<<br><br>Mine is "learn basis of Esperanto grammar"  Don't ask me why!  LOL ;-)  I've always heard people talk about Esperanto as the most useless exercise ever and I just want to see for myself ;-)<br><br>>>> Cut garden hedge <<<<br><br>Mine is much less fun ... "Pull dead weeds and spray those that are still alive."<br><br>>>> Practise choir part <<<<br><br>Mine is drill piano scales.<br><br>>>> Sort photos from visit to a friend with new baby <<<<br><br>ARG!  Mine is sorting vacation photos.  It is SO much easier to take pictures than sort them.  Did I mention that my digital card holds over 1,000 pictures and I can clear it to the laptop as I go?  OY!  But ACDSee is making life a bit easier in that regard.<br><br>>>> Write review for Hitchcock's "The Manxman" for Lovefilm.com<br><br>Mmmmm, never heard of that one, and I'm a Hitchcock lover.<br><br>>>> Watch "Citizen Kane" on DVD for umpteenth time <<<<br><br>Amazing work!  What a monster talent he was.<br><br>>>> Write today's entry in Journal 10+ <<<<br><br>Yup, that's in mine as well.<br><br>>>> Go for walk  <<<<br><br>Yeah, along with "Work out with dumb bells" for me.<br><br>I wonder how many of us have similar items.</div>

Now, after breakfast, he comes up next to me on the couch, looks at me with his big cow eyes, and waits for me to let him sniff the comb.  Then he rubs his whiskers against the comb which is cat for "PLEEEEASE comb me!"  Then he lies down for a good long combing before he falls asleep.  LOL ;-)  He has finally discovered that running away and hiding is not his best strategy.  But then, cats are nothing if not flexible ;-)<br><br></div>

I'm in!<br><br>My major goal is to finish working through the business planning book I am using with my new business idea: result will be clarified ideas about the business, a draft business plan and a list of steps from here to there (here being the 9-to-5, there being my own business).<br><br>I am committing now to a progress report on here each week, I'll aim for Sundays. <br><br>I will also use AF2 at home and work every day except for the week that I am away.  I had become very half-assed in my use of AF and feel much more positive about AF2.  The structure sounds like it will address the issues I was having with AF; I'll let you know.<br><br>Good luck everyone, <br>Lucy</div>
