<div class="content">I am loving the AF technique so far, and will write more about that later, but I have one question for Mark...<br><br>I have a writing project that I want to work on.  It's something new that I'm starting, that I'm excited about, but have some anxiety & uncertainty about, too.   I notice today, that instead of letting the items related to the project stand out...  I'm going to the list with a strong thought that I should pick the writing project item, even before I've scanned the list.  Is that strong internal push something that I ought to follow, or am I bringing my old mental habits to a new technique?<br><br>So far, the week has been very productive.  And I notice that along with this internal "should," for the first time this week, I have some resistance to approaching the list.  If we get to the list with a "should" thought in the mind, and also some resistance about following through, is that not the real "standing out" that we're looking for?<br><br>Not trying to get all nit-picky about rules here--  It's just this system has worked so well & so fluidly for me this week, I don't want to mess it up & start to resent & avoid it, as I have with other productivity systems in the past.<br><br>Thanks for any thoughts on this.</div>

<div class="content">Kathy:<br><br>I think you have a two choices here if you want to preserve the integrity of the AF system:<br><br>1) Allocate a specific time of day for the writing project and work at it for a specific length of time. Many well-known writers organise their writing this way. If you this, then the writing project won't appear on your AF list at all.<br><br>2) Otherwise ignore the "should" and just concentrate on working the system. You will get to the writing project soon enough, and it will be all the better for the wait.</div>

<div class="content">I have just started the beta testing yesterday and am so far pleasantly surprised - I think the main benefit is the breaking down of resistance to procrastination and allowing you to focus on things that really are important instead of just things you think are important. Often it's not so much that the individual item that is important but the importance is getting it done before it becomes urgent and the little but often approach is key to this.<br><br>I've noticed some big projects that I've been resisting for a while now and one of them is now the first task on the page I'm on. Scheduling time (1) hasn't ever worked for me (though I live in hope...). I have a choice to ignore this (2) and come back when it is the only task on the page (but there are a few others like this on the page so it could make it scary if I leave all the hard ones to the end) but the cool thing about the system is that it also has another option:<br><br>3) Just start it, remembering you only need to work on it for as long as you feel comfortable. If it's not finished, write it again at the end of the list (ie another page - yay!)<br><br>19 times out of 20, it's the idea of starting that's the worst part. Knowing I can just chip away at things and get it off my page to another page both motivates me and breaks down a huge amount of resistance to working on these big scary looking projects.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks so much, Mark.<br><br>I tried the second approach, and it worked beautifully.  Even though I was thinking I *should* work on that writing project when I picked up the list, I stuck to the process.  A couple very trivial tasks stood out before the project, and I did them & returned to the list.  By the time I got to the project, I was really eager to get to it, and that mixed feeling of "should/don't want to" had evaporated.  Very interesting.<br><br>I've done the block of time approach to writing projects before, and it usually ends up with me sitting there and 1) writing drivel, or 2) procrastinating online & then beating myself up for wasting time.  This approach is wonderful.<br><br>Thank you!</div>
