<div class="content">Hi all <br>As you know i am not really a jeek but i red this article and found it very interesting. The author seems to love autofocus and he tried to adapt it on the terrific Omnifocus. <br>Here is the link to read that. <br><a href="http://www.pda-247.com/wordpress/2009/06/omnifocus-15-for-iphone-review/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pda-247.com/wordpress/2009/06/omnifocus-15-for-iphone-review/</a><br><br>So as i have OF i decided to try it and see if may be AF2 method could work with it. <br>It seems to be... incredible no ? <br><br>of course i have simplifie dissmissing tasks just in creating a context dissmiss. The method of dissmissing thing can work except that each item dissmiss must be changed as a context dissmiss<br><br>I did that because of the convenience of omnifocus and as i have an iphone it works so well with it. <br><br>Hope this help.</div>

<div class="content">Yes, I'm implementing AF2 in OmniFocus. I was using OmniOutliner for AF1 as it allowed for the pagination.<br><br>But now that pagination is now longer a feature of AF2, I reverted to OmniFocus primarily because of the iPhone syncing.<br><br>I have only 2 projects - autofocus and out/about.<br><br>I have 3 contexts - active, dismissed and out.<br><br>And a couple of perspectives to allow me to slice and dice my data in different ways.<br><br>I'll try and put some pics up in the Flickr group later.<br><br>So far it works like a treat!</div>

<div class="content">Thank you for these pictures - and for this streamlined way to use Omnifocus. I too have the desktop and iPhone app, and have a GTD set-up - which is great at the outset and then eventually becomes too cumbersome/complex... with AF2 as you've set it up, things are simple again! I've been implementing AF2 on paper, but I'm going to try AF2/OF.</div>

<div class="content">Bongoman: A couple of questions: 1) How do you make Active the default context for the quick entry feature? 2) When I switch back to Context from Project mode, even though I'd chosen Ungrouped for Contexts, it reverts back to Context. Is there a way to make it stay the default? Thanks for your help!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Bongo !<br>Sound very interesting. I like the way you have switch contexts to active, dissmiss and out. <br>For myself i have a lot of projects i need to think about so i kepts a project centralisation ordonated by AREA -. This help me to drag and drop items from projet to autofocus and autofocus to project. Anyway i could erase all my project and keep nothing but autofocus but i would have to add to each task the relative project and make a search about it <br>One thing i love with OF is the end date and start date which help me to affect my priorities and the right management of my time. The other thing i like is the capacity to make an historical sum of each task accomplished. At last i found a very good appliance. This mornig i was with a client "Boris" and i could not remember all the things we had to speak about. I just made a search on my iphone about "boris" and it founds me all the subjects immediatly :))  this is a great help for me.</div>

<div class="content">Just a question Bongo What is OUT in project and context what do you put in there ?</div>

<div class="meta">2009-06-30 12:55</div>
<div class="content">Claudia<br><br>1). you can set the default context for a project in the Project panel of the Inspector  - the third panel in the Inspector.<br><br>My setup basically only has one project for autofocus purposes - the 'Autofocus' project for which I've set the default context to be 'active'.<br><br>2). I think the reason I don't see the jumping between grouped and ungrouped is that I am using Perspectives to jump between the project view and the context view and that Perspectives holds the grouping behavior unchanged. So I set up my desired context view, with ungrouped as the behavior and with the 'active' context highlighted, then take a snapshot of that window to save as a perspective.<br><br>Does that make sense?<br><br>When I first started playing with OF and AF2, I thought that the grouping and sorting in OF would let me down, but so far it has been rock solid, both on the desktop and the iPhone - my list is staying in exactly the same order I entered the items, in both project and context views. So it is possible, but I think Perspectives here are the key.<br><br>The other issue here is that I found in context view if I directly entered a new item, it would sort to the top of the list, whereas if I used the Quick Entry window, it would end up at the bottom of the list. So my default behavior is to use Quick Entry for adding tasks.<br><br>Again, I realise this probably makes it all sound complicated, but it's been a revelation how simple it has actually been.<br><br>Jupiter,<br><br>Out is simply for errands - shopping, banking etc. Typically stuff I do in town after dropping the kids at school, before heading back to my home office. I keep it off my autofocus list following Mark's suggestion to this effect. It just allows it to get synced to the iPhone so I have the errands list in my pocket.<br><br>The Out project and my Autofocus project are kept very separate in OF. There is no mingling of the items at all, and OF allows me to do this in a simple manner.<br><br>I've had a great couple of days with OF and AF2 - I love the ability to jump between the whole list (with active, completed & dismissed tasks all visible) to the 'active' context view, with just the available tasks to be worked on.</div>

<div class="content">It's really interesting because I've been doing something very similar. The only difference is that in the context view I sort by "start date", which means that actions that become available later (because they are time dependent) end up in the correct place. Unfortunately it means I have to manually move those in the project view, but they are so few of them it does not really matter.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-06-30 14:30</div>
<div class="content">Bongoman, I really appreciate the fast reply! Now I have my Perspectives set for Projects and Contexts - thank you. The last thing seems to be the Quick Entry window - how do you set that so that it defaults to AutoFocus as the project and Active as the context? I have to reenter these each time. This is great though - a real breakthrough.</div>

<div class="content">@Bongo<br>Thanks. I love it ! I have modified OF as you have done. I saw the picture on flicks and it sounds really interesting. I think you have found the best way to manage OF. <br>Using AF is great but on paper for me it become really non operational except at the really beginning of it. Using OF with AF is for me a real progress with leads me out of proscratrination. It force me to act ! More i am productive and efficient and this what i want. <br>AF2 is also a real progress from AF1. Dissmissing has always been for me a real problem it is so complicated and difficult to do on the rush. So with an OF context "dissmiss" it makes a real sense. Thanks again for sharing your system with us as you see there is almost one person who was helped by your thread. All the best Jupiter.</div>

<div class="content">In you're using OmniFocus (or another task manager) of AF, is there any reason NOT to use contexts?<br><br>I know that generally you want the long list that is AF, but why not take advantage of the extra data field OmniFocus provides? Once in a while, it might be nice to pluck out a few specific tasks. "Out" is a good example. I would use "basement" for another.</div>

<div class="content">Context may be effectivly usefull in certain case. However i was really a trouble for me in all my test about working on the rush. Sometimes they were too numerous, other time they were not appropriate. Sometime they blocked me in my GTD approach. <br><br>I noticed also, that a strict system killed my intuition. In my mind it was like if suddently putting stuff in a case said to my brain "stop beeing creative" just do. But i am not a computer. I am a human. <br><br>This experience is really for me, one of the worst things that happened in my job for in business most of the deals i do are not done by the computer but only with a flash of intuition about a building or a client.<br><br>It is so present with me that i have stopped working on computer for times just because it killed this little light i have in me. <br><br>MF method lighted the candle again showing me that i could use my intuition and staying creative; It showed me too that i could work in a real mess (what is AF) and still being productive. However, AF1 & 2 with MF really helps me. It is for me the missing link of GTD.<br><br>In OF there is also a little missing function : the ability to make a task dissmiss or wainting for. The incredible fact is that this function exists for projects. I wonder why they never applied it to contexts. It would be realy easy for the appliance of items...<br><br>Anyway, i kept some existing contexts such as errands, For the rest i find very easy to read my long list in the AF2 way i can also see my context active and dissmiss items when i dont know wat to do with them. <br><br>And working on OF with AF rules is for me a real bridge betwween intuition and rationality. <br>Yes i can find items relatives to a person or a project and still work on the rush. <br>In my cas OF has the apparence of rationality but in fact it is nothing more than a collector for my stuff with some big rocks such as due date, projects, or people. And it works with the iphone. <br><br>So this is the reason why i dont use context in the strictly GTD manner. <br>Except that, i follow most of the GTD method and AF2 method too. <br>I dont want to choose. Both of them are good for me and my work.</div>

<div class="content">@ Bongo. <br>I am trying to improove AF2 implementation in OF <br>So i try to make a list with a  task created at the end of the list<br>So i did a perspective, chose project and it work it goes at the end. (if i do it on context it goe at the beginning. But how can i automaticaly choose active in context ? Ho did you do  Thanks.</div>

<div class="content">Bongoman - I hope this is the last thing I have to bug you with! Am I correct that in Context mode, you can only see items still to do (you cannot view completed items here unless you select Completed in the Status view)? You can only see all items completed and not completed in the Projects view?<br>Thanks - I'm almost there!</div>

<div class="meta">2009-06-30 22:19</div>
<div class="content">Jupiter, to choose 'active' as the context in your perspective, set up the window just how you want it in context mode with 'active' selected in the sidebar, then choose "Save Window as New Perspective". You can then name the Perspective as you wish.<br><br>I've also found that if I add tasks on context mode, they go to the beginning of the list - so I only add in project mode OR by quick entry window.<br><br>Claudia, you do have to enter the 'autofocus' project in quick entry, but can do so quickly by tabbing to that field then typing 'af' as OF will locate the project based on the abbreviation. If you have set 'active' as the default context for your 'autofocus' project, then you can leave the context field blank - the task will automatically get the 'active' context.<br><br>Again, if you have set your preferences (in the main preferences window, under 'Data') to 'Cleanup Inbox Items which have a Context' and have set your 'Default List for Single Actions' to your 'autofocus' project then all should be good.<br><br>You should also set your autofocus project to be a 'parallel' project via the Inspector.<br><br>Claudia, you're correct about what you can see in context mode. So I have a Perspective that shows everything in Project mode which I have named 'all' - it's the closest approximation to a paper list if you were running AF2 in a notebook, in that everything is visible at all times. The settings from the Perspectives window are:<br><br>View Mode - Planning<br>Focus - No Focus<br>Filter- Remaining<br>Grouping - Ungrouped<br>Sorting - Unsorted<br>Action Filter - Any Status<br>Time Filter - Any Duration<br>Flag Filter - Any Flag State<br><br><br>Then I have an 'active' Perspective in context mode that doesn't show completed, only 'remaining':<br><br>View Mode - Context<br>Focus - No Focus<br>Filter - Remaining<br>Grouping - Ungrouped<br>Sorting - Project<br>Action Filter - Remaining<br>Time Filter - Any Duration<br>Flag Filter - Any Flag State</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for posting those, bongoman. Looks good; I'm just going to wait and see how crippled I feel without an app running on AF2 on my iPhone (and to see whether the developers of Things make the necessary changes to their iPhone app to get around the current problem) before committing to converting to a new app (and buying it!).</div>

<div class="content">Makes sense, Martin.<br><br>I already had OF for my Mac and for the iPhone, which were sitting there unused since I moved to AF. But with the lack of the concept of a 'page' in AF2, it's been great to dust off both OF apps and find that I have a very workable digital solution, and that the $ I spent on OF wasn't wasted after all.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Thanks@ Bongoman  !<br>I like it. A few weeks ago i was ready to throw away OF from my iphone. This way of doing thing make it really usefull and operational. As i have a lot of items and project it is a great improovement from the basic GTD approach. I also notice since yesterday that i work much faster and also more focus. The function research is indeed fantastic. It works beter than tags and also alouds a lot a freedom near the writing. All the best<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Bongoman, I've now set it up just like you said and will see how it goes today! With Quick Entry, when I create items on the fly, they end up in my Inbox, they don't go by themselves into my list. There must be some little step I'm missing here.... any ideas? <br><br>Regarding AF vs GTD: do you keep a master list of projects? Do you still do a Weekly Review? <br></div>
<h2>Reply by bongoman</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-07-1 12:02</div>
<div class="content">Hi Claudia<br><br>The key to the Inbox issue is the preference setting in the main OF prefs: "Clean up Inbox items which have a context".<br><br>So as along as items have the 'active' context, they will be cleared out automatically. This is another reason to ensure that the 'autofocus' project automatically assigns the 'active' context to items. That way, you only need to send an item to the 'autofocus' project via the quick entry window and it will end up in the right place.<br><br>At this stage I'm not keeping a separate projects list, nor doing a weekly review. I'll see how this goes as time goes on.<br><br></div>

<div class="meta">2009-07-1 15:38</div>
<div class="content">I know this isn't the OF troubleshooting forum, but I have it set up correctly and there my new task created in QuickEntry still sits in the Inbox - with AutoFocus as the project and Active as the context. If I hit the Clean Up icon it moves them out of the inbox and into the list. It's not that big of a deal but I'm baffled.</div>

<div class="content">#2 test of AF2 with Omnifocus<br>The day was hard. I had a lot of things to do and i was quiet stressed by the business. <br>However on the rsh Omnifocus settled as AF2 bravously resisted to the storm.<br>I noticed that i did less task than when i was on paper. Howerver what i did was the most important things i had to do. I easely identified what i didn t do and i know tha if i did nt do it it was simply because i was shortless on time left. <br>I am very happy with this test. Of course the problem for me is still the task with goes at the top on context and at the end on my only project "autofocus". But i think i shall soon get it and it will be ok. The real progress is also about dissmissing things. The way to put<br>+++++++++++++++++++<br>after my non actioned task did nt bring me anythings. <br>On the opposit dissmissing items what much better on the rush during creating or reporting new items on my AF list. <br>Welm, well it sounds really interesting.

<div class="content">one other advantage is the sorting of all my items by dead line. I put an end date to each item i wich or i ought to do and it is sorted automaticaly in the context active. It is so great to do first the most important things. I can focus on my bigs rocks. I think i have found my way. The only incovenient is to spent my time in front of my computer i hate that !!!!</div>

Watever happened everything was under control. I noticed i did look very much at the all list all time. The double reading let the item stand at me naturaly and everything was dissmiss on the way little by little. <br>OF on my iphone did nt helped me at all. But at my office doing thing it was almost perfect. <br>I thinks it worked for me for two reason. <br>1. everything is centralised in a single system<br>2. The research function is great for sorting the items relative to a project<br>3. The AF2 method adapted to OF let me a lot of freedom near paper and the rewriting of items leads me to my objective little by little. <br>4. I trust the system because i know that watever i want to do i shall find my informations. <br>5. With the AF2 system i work day by day. as my item are classified by creation date i can easely go to the past and see what is important or not. So i can easely decides what actions i have to to NOW. <br>Nothing to add. Exept tht i just compleed the system with a list of my most important project classified by their priorities which never leave my office desk. <br>So thanks to @Bongoman for the implementation it's your idea and it's great and thanks again to MF for AF1 and 2 because t really work.<br>I could never imagin 3 weeks ago i would work so eeffciently with a computer and OF.</div>

It's a detail the big rocks of what i want to speak with him are in my peoject PEOPLE @project FXM<br><br>It makes now 2 weeks i have been working like this and i have not changes any things but details. So at last it works for me. <br><br>For the reading i use MF AF method on my mood from the beginning to the end or from the end to the beginning it doesnt matter but it has to be fast until an item stand at me so if after some reading an item doesnt want to stant at me i just dissmiss it on the flow. <br>if it begings in the fiuture i just put a start and end date on it so it appears in grey in my leat and my brain immediatly recognize it and says reading it "OK i understand it is not for now !" let's go<br><br>The advantage of this use of of is a real operational system, which doesnt miss anythings, which let me work on my project, which let me thing about suspended project and read them how many times i want, which let mly work as i need little by little on project. <br><br>I am the first one surprised by how easy is the system. I don't still realise how simple it is and how efficient it can be. It just work. But anyway it is a simple compilation of MF, GTD, Jupiter, and Omnifocus methods.<br><br>Hope this help. <br><br>Jupiter<br></div>
