<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>Isn't it time you changed the main Autofocus link on your website to point to RAF instructions instead of AF1 instructions?</div>

<div class="content">Mark seems to be waiting for RRAF to do so. (See AF vs. TRO thread.)</div>

<div class="content">Wouldn't it make sense to simply have links to all three Autofocus versions accessible from the main Autofocus link?<br><br>Especially since it isn't even sure if and when AF4 will see the light of day...</div>

<div class="content">Cruisader:<br><br><< Wouldn't it make sense to simply have links to all three Autofocus versions accessible from the main Autofocus link? >><br><br>Yes, it would. But I'll have to write some descriptive notes with each link - advantages and disadvantages and the like - otherwise people will be even more confused than they are at the moment.<br><br>However at the rate the new system is enabling me to get through my work that shouldn't take long!</div>

<div class="content">Cruisader:<br><br>I've now actioned your suggestion. You can see the results by clicking on the "Autofocus System" menu tab.</div>

<div class="content">Great!<br><br>When do you think RRAF2/AF4 will be released?</div>

<div class="content">Difficult to say because the whole point of testing is to get the balance right. A lack of balance may only show up after some time.</div>

<div class="content">"RRAF2/AF4"<br><br>Lol.<br><br>While I, like many others I assume, are waiting with baited breath for this new "addictive" system of Mark's, it does make me wonder what newcomers to this forum must be thinking with all these acronyms flying around...it's almost like a secret code. :)</div>

<div class="content">Frank:<br><br>Hopefully they'll have looked at the Autofocus System tab, where all is explained!</div>
