<div class="content">How wonderful to see a new system to try.<br><br>That means I get to start a New List.<br><br>Don't know about you, but my lists always end up quite furry with some things I am not sure what they mean, some things I keep avoiding and other entries I'll never tackle because I don't have enough time or enough committment.<br><br>With a New List I can dump all thoise and start over.<br><br>Maybe I (or we as a group fixated on task management systems) don't really need new systems just permission to start over and dump all the stuff I can't do or won't do...<br><br>Anyone else recognise the pattern???</div>

<div class="content">Actually Mike - what I recognize is something more daft. My general excitement for new systems indicates the following:<br><br>* I have too much time on my hands<br>* I'm not currently engaged in a project that stirs my heart<br>* I'm resisting something <br><br>Redoing lists... taking on a new TM system only obfuscates the above.</div>

<div class="content">Yep, redoing lists is definitely a reason for trying a new system. But so is filling a notebook and starting a new one, which is another reason I'll stick to paper...</div>

<div class="content">Hi Avrum<br>Your post is brilliant!  I've learned to keep to my tried and true system until my resistance to a particularly onerous project is causing me a problem.  Of course, using my timer can and will "force me over the hump", but that takes a LOT of GRINDING it out until I feel satisfied with my results for the day.  SOMETIMES I can inplement a temporary tweak to distract my dislike into a challenge to test the tweak!  I have a question for you.<br>I always know full well that I'm tricking my attitude into doing the work using a slightly different procedure/format,  yet it usually takes the bait anyway.  Why is I know full well that I'm doing the same work anyway?<br>or.......maybe I shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth.......<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>my typo: "Why is I know full well that I'm doing the same work anyway?"<br>It should read: "Why, if I know full well that I'm doing the same work anyway?" <br><br> What I specifically am asking is "Why does the onerous work become less resistant simply because I'm testing a tweak that I know full well is simply used as a cheap trick to temporarily improve my attitude toward the onerous project?  <br><br>You have gifted me with some really great insights in your posts.  Do you happen to know the answer to this?  On the surface, it makes me feel foolish that my mind is so gullible, yet...on the other hand, I'm glad that I can trick it into doing the work with less effort/ginding!  LOL!  Could this be a hidden gift resulting from my brain injuries or is this a normal thing?<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">It's simple, Learning:  "New" is fun and interesting.  "Old" is boring.  Who wouldn't rather do new things?  So change the system and suddenly everything is new!</div>

<div class="content"><<It's simple, Learning: "New" is fun and interesting. "Old" is boring. Who wouldn't rather do new things?

See: infidelity & marriage. <br><br>Or am I being too psychodynamic?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Alan B. and Avrum<br>ROTFL!  I'm not forsaking my work for other activity, so I'm not betraying it!  LOL!  I'm simply dressing it up a bit differently for a small while!  I still don't understand how this works.  Of course, sometimes I'm NOT fooled by it and I'm forced to grind it out with my timer method.  It's inelegant but is still better than  ignoring it.  Avrum, I suppose our work is similar to maintaining a relationship.  Some days are better than others.  Still, the relationship needs continuous nurturing especially during those times that you least want to!  lol!<br>learning as I go</div>
