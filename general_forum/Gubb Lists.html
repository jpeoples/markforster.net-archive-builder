<div class="content">I just came across this free online checklist resource which looks very interesting, not entirely AF friendly as it allows reordering etc. and doesnt allow focusing on one page at at a time, but very good for any checklist you may want to keep and access via the web (including mobile).<br><br><a href="http://www.gubb.net/home" rel="nofollow">http://www.gubb.net/home</a><br><br>Regards,<br><br>Derek.</div>

<div class="content">I checked it out and at first thought: "Wow, all of these sample lists.  They must have done a ton of work thinking about different formats and configurations for each of those!"  But alas, those are only headings.  They are all the same in format.  Item, date, reminder.<br><br>I'm trying to think of why I would just not use EverNote for this application.  And with EverNote I could have check boxes and formatting and all of that fun stuff ;-)  Of course, EverNote does not have reminders.  But then this also looks a lot like RTM.</div>
