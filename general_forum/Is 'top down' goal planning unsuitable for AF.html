<div class="content">Hi everyone,<br><br>Expanding on Jaqueline's excellent post re Goal Orientated Autofocus, I'm interested in hearing Mark's and others views here. <br><br>Specifically, are top down planning approaches like the Seven Habits or Your Best Year Yet (as two examples) compatible with AF. Or, conversely, could they actually interrupt or somehow impede the organic growth in developing goals, from the bottom up, over a period of time?</div>

<div class="content">Leon:<br><br>My own feeling is that there's nothing incompatible between AF and top-down planning. Indeed where you've been given the goals by others then you have little choice in the matter. However I think that AF will tend to favour the goals which you really identify with. The trouble with top-down planning - in my experience at least - is that you often tend to give yourself a lot of goals which you think you "ought" to have, rather than the ones you really want.</div>

<div class="content">Each year I make an annual plan that runs from June to May. It is based on Ditzler's book Your Best Year Yet! I can't see any reason why I would not do the same thing this year, even though I am doing AF. <br><br>I will spend the last week of May creating the plan. Then, once a week, there will be a reminder in my calendar to review the plan. I delete the item from my calendar and put it in my AF list. <br><br>My personal experience has been that any effective bottoms-up system is much more important than a top-down system. In other words, I reaped many more gains by getting organized at the level of tasks and actions than I did by developing 1-year or 5-year or longer plans. <br><br>Covey has you start at the top--missions, values, etc.--and work your way down to tasks. It makes sense, but it didn't work for me any many others. <br><br>But . . . after I was able to get myself well-organized at the task level for a year or two, I started to crave higher-level planning. Then I welcomed the ideas of Covey, Ditzler, Lakein, et. al. <br><br>Some time in May, I will enter onto my AF list "Annual Plan."</div>

<div class="content">Hi Leon,<br><br>I have done this kind of top down planning for too many years to count while not making the progress that I was capable of.  Having started AF this year with top-down goals as well, I feel that my top 3 goals remained the same, but the others have fallen by the wayside a bit.  I think that all but one didn't need the attention that I thought it did - but I fell into that trap of thinking that I had to have "balance" (ie. address all areas of my life - financial, career, health, etc.).  Part of that is due to the realization, thanks to AF, that I really don't have the discretionary time to focus on all of them if I want to achieve my highest priorities for the year.   So it has pointed out to me that these goals were in fact conflicting / incompatible.  <br><br>I still don't understand the concept of organically developing goals without at least having a basic vision of what you want your life to be about.  <br><br>I also believe that being open enough to taking a step in a different direction by responding to an autofocus item could lead to development of something that you never even dreamed of.  I hope I won't dismiss it when that time comes for me. :-)<br><br></div>

<div class="content">I found Jacqueline's original post on Goal Orientated Autofocus very thought provoking and think that it is natural to start AF (or any TM system for that matter) from where we are, i.e. with the goals, projects, targets etc that we have in place.  However, in using AF, it then seems that AF sifts those goals/projects/targets to identify whether they genuinely are the "right" goals/projects/targets for us. I think we need to be aware that AF will identify any inconsistencies between any goals we enter into the system and our genuine values and beliefs, and also cause us to recognise and perhaps act on them differently, according to whether they are "ours", imposed by others, or "oughts".<br><br>I am finding that AF is causing me to look at the way in which I define my goals etc. and that will in the long term impact upon what those goals are.  It seems to me that we start with "Goal Orientated Autofocus" and graduate in a way to "AutoFocus Orientated Goals".  It would make sense to me that, once Autofocus enables us to identify what Mark refers to as the goals we really identify with (from a bottom up approach), then the planning of them can then be actioned in a top down planning session in the way moises describes.</div>

<div class="content">I've posted about my digital implementation of Your Best Your Yet. Because most of the goals I chose are very important to me, I naturally add related tasks to my AF list. I can also mark those specific tasks accordingly and see how much progress I'm making on each goal (at least in terms of number of tasks done). But one problem I've had with Ditzler's approach: She requires you to have one goal per role at least. That forced me to choose a relational goal that really isn't very important to me. I would much rather have had more goals in other roles. And, as expected, I'm doing poorly on that relational goal. Next year, I plan to choose the 10 goals that mean the most to me, regardless of the role they're ascribed to. I'm not so naturally unbalanced that I need to be forced to have a goal for every role. Other than that criticism of her specific philosophy, I think AF works beautifully with top-down goal planning.</div>

<div class="content">Interesting comments, thanks to everyone for you thoughts so far. I was thinking of dusting off my copy of 'Your Best Year Yet' or even checking out the website Mel has remarked on. On the other hand I  feel that AF is working effectively for helping me to sift out tasks and projects that I want to advance, and that are important to me. <br><br>The items I have on my AF list at the moment can all be tracked back to a higher level of goal (e.g. fitness levels, home improvements) anyway. Maybe I don't need a formal top-down planning session at all. Time may tell as my work with AF evolves. <br><br>Another thing about AF is that it is so current, it can provide a snap shot where I am at right now. It seems flexible enough to cater for changing circumstances. Conversely I've found in the past that goals established from top down planning sessions can sometimes seem rigid or outdated.</div>

<div class="content">I agree whole-heartedly with the role issue Mel, I didn't care for that either.  It's like someone telling me that I have to have a spiritual goal - says who?  Or a career goal for a Walmart greeter who wants a low stress job and only views their career as a way to pay for their other goals.<br><br>Do you use all 10 goals though?  I found that 2-3 major and a couple of minor ones are all I can really focus on at a time.  Like the juggler who drops all the balls when they reach their ball limit.<br></div>

<div class="content">I've found it important in my life to look back at what I've actually done over the years and see what threads stand out. That way one can gain more insight into what the underlying goals are that one is unconsciously following. These goals are likely to be far more powerful than the ones we have imposed on ourselves. If you are clear what they are then one can co-operate with them instead of fighting them.</div>
<h2>Reply by Jacqueline</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-03-8 23:11</div>
<div class="content">I see your point Mark.  Isn't that living in conguence with your underlying values?  Say for example someone looks back on their life and see a thread of focus and drive towards a career at the expense of a social life, time with family etc.  Then they come to a stage in life where they decide to retire.  Given their obvious desire to achieve at work/business, it would be foolish to think that they would be happy just sitting by the pool sipping margaritas with friends all the time.  <br><br>But sometimes we have to fight against our natural inclinations, don't we?  Say the workaholic's life would work better if he gets some balance.  Because it's not his natural inclination to spend time with family or friends, sometimes doesn't it have to be forced at first?  Isn't that part of growth?</div>

<div class="content">I'd like to add that there are situations where you absolutely need to plan your larger goals at least a year in advance. One such situation is when you have to plan your holidays for the whole year at the beginning of the year as mandated by your employer and you have to coordinate them with your colleagues on one side and your family on the other. <br>If you want to do some advanced professional training (sorry, don't know the correct English expression for what I mean), or are planning to do the final exams of your part-time studies this year, it's probably not the right year for that trip to Nepal. <br>Sometimes you might even need to plan several years in advance. Say, for example, you want to build a house in the next two years. <br><br>Of course, this doesn't explain how you identify which long-range goals to follow in the first place. <br><br>In other words, planning the next year to some detail is an absolute necessity, IMO, while your long-range plans might come from anywhere, be it Lakein or Covey or intuition, as long as you really want it. Drawing lessons from the past, like Mark describes, will be helpful, but not always sufficient. You might not have enough basis for conclusions, especially if you want to open up new horizons.<br><br>Personally, I have always struggled with planning horizons between pipe dreams and planning for the next six months. Every planning perspective longer than half a year has always overwhelmed me, and not doing said 12-months-or-longer planning has done severe damage to my life in the past. <br><br>Oh, and I agree that 10 major goals for a year is way too many.</div>

<div class="content">Very bummed here as my original post disappeared. UGH! <br><br>Anyway, now I'll get right to the point. LOL Yes, I agree Alex that 10 is probably too many. My best accomplishments have been as a result of having one goal, but I can't keep up a singular focus indefinitely. I've definitely dropped some goals I set last August. <br><br>I don't know that I think only bottom up thinking works for me. I feel restless and unhappy if I can't see the bigger picture in what I'm doing. I also think that no one can be completely bottom up or top down. Working AF lists always involves some goals, just not formally written ones. Working on pre-planned goals also involves changes in priorities and plans. So maybe it's really just a matter of where you prefer to start. <br><br>I had a goal of organizing my digital pictures through 2007 by mid-August. I'm not doing well at all on it. BUT, I have done considerable tagging and organizing for other projects, one of which was a last-minute one. So, am I meeting my goal or not? No if it's getting all my pictures tagged, yes if it's devoting time to preserving our family photos. In that sense, the AF list has sorted out my "real goal" which is to do something with my pictures.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mel<br><br>Just a tip if you lose your post - if you page back to the page you were posting within and reclick the post a reply button it may have retained your writings - it's worked for me a couple of times!<br><br>What I've found with AF is that I've put my goals and projects into AF (which I've already defined from a top down approach) and AF somehow reorders them (the bottom up approach).  I've then taken them out of AF, redefined them (top down) and put them back.  I agree with you that you somehow need to see that level of structure, but for me that is in my project management system rather than AF.  So I guess it works as top down in my PM system and bottom up in AF, with goals/projects etc being moved between the two according to the way in which they need to be worked with.</div>

<div class="content">For me top-down goals are best articulated as what I call "process" goals.<br><br>I put in a full year with Best Year Yet in 2007 and though it was very beneficial, I found that a number of goals became stale towards the end of the year.  I do not feel inclined to follow this course again.  <br><br>However, for many years now, my wife and I have sat down at the end of the year and reviewed the past year and set down "dreams" for the following year.  We call them dreams in order to avoid any feeling of compulsion about them.  But I have found that it is better to set in place "processes" that will assist a proper balance in my life.<br><br>eg FITNESS:  Join the gym and visit maybe 100 times for the year. (I began doing weight-lifting but finished up doing aerobics, yoga and swimming -- You see, the process led to a evolution in the activity)<br><br>eg TECHNOLOGY: Attend the local community centre weekly for the year (I started doing Photoshop but then followed on with numerous other skills that the chosen teacher was adept at - doing many wonderful things I had not specifically planned.)<br><br>eg. SPIRITUALITY: Choose a "spiritual companion" and visit her for an hour a month.  (A wonderful way to encourage me to be "on a path" without knowing where specifically it may lead.<br><br>eg LIFE-PLANNING: Experiment with Autofocus for 2009.<br><br>What all these "goals" have in common is that they involve a commitment to a process and the outcomes are left open.<br><br>This approach gives me an ideal basic structure for the time span of a year. The goals are very easy to keep at the forefront of my mind. They stimulate growth but they avoid most of the dangers of being "over-prescriptive".</div>

<div class="content">I'm a professional writer, working from a small flat. I've been using AutoFocus for ten days, so my experience is necessarily limited, but I have already noticed the following:<br><br>On the first day I wrote down a task 'Think about making flat less claustrophobic' which is still sitting there, waiting to be dealt with. Yesterday, the tenth day, I looked around me and the flat seemed brighter and clearer, although the tasks I had attempted were of the 'organise sock drawer' and 'scrub kitchen sink' variety. (Also 'write novel', but that's another story.)<br><br>So what I have learned in my first week is simply to trust the system. If my subconscious knows what's important to me at the moment it will pick the tasks that are relevant to my goal. Oh, and this morning I've written twice as much as usual of my novel.<br><br>So, thank you, Mark Forster.<br><br>cw</div>

<div class="content">Mark, your last post really helps me understand your thinking on AF and goals. It's as though goal planning is just part of AF and isn't formal. There isn't a goal-planning session (unless you create that in AF). I certainly create many mini-goals using AF. I am going to try creating bigger ones with it.<br><br>I wholeheartedly agree with you on the "workaholic" guilt. Whenever I have been sick in my life, people are quick to attribute it to "stress." I, however, have not been feeling stressed at all. I realize that people look at the number of things I do and think THEY would be stressed so assume I am. Just because someone does a lot doesn't mean they're stressed, out of balance, or not doing something that could change the world.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Mark, I agree that sometimes a life is most well-lived if it's unbalanced in other people's eyes, but as an - ahem - "career oriented indiviual" - I don't want to get to the point where I don't have good relationships with my children or friends - perhaps my "workaholic" example wasn't a good one (yes, I was talking about a "friend" - ie. myself).  My own father was extremely business / financially oriented and quite frankly, is living the cliche of literally old and alone with a big bank account but no friends and no family that visit except out of obligation.  He was probably happy amassing more $, and did change the world in his area of business, but at what price?  He has regrets now, but you can't turn back time or change the habits of a lifetime when you're 90 years old.  Well, you can, but he wouldn't begin to know how.<br><br>Jim, I REALLY like your idea of putting in a process rather than a goal if you're the average person and not say, trying out for the Olympics or wanting the accomplishment of a marathon.  Fitness can mean going for a walk, playing DDR, doing a few body weight squats or stretching while you're making supper.  Good stuff !</div>

<div class="content">I can't get the map analogy out of my head when I think of not having a concrete goal to work towards.  ie. go from Florida to New York without a map (or at least knowing you have to go north) and you could end up in California.  Is what you're saying that part of the goal is the journey, not the destination?  <br><br>Not "did you get your degree", but "what did you learn?"  Not "do you have $2,0000,000 saved for retirement, but do you have enough to feel free / satisfied / abundant?"  <br><br>I just wouldn't want to be the poor schmuck who wakes up at 65 y.o. and realizes that he hasn't saved a penny towards retirement because he never consciously made it a goal to do so.  His underlying goal of "overspend according to your means so you can impress the neighbours" may be powerful, but he's a fool if he cooperates with it.<br><br>I still think that's living in accordance with your values.  The hard part is figuring out what your values are (which you can and should find out from your history - you don't need an AF list to tell you that, but it could be a useful tool) and acknowledging what they really are vs. what is politically correct is important.  ie. People would say they love their families the most, but don't show this by their actions.<br><br>Pardon all my questioning, but this is something I wanted to figure out for myself - where's the line between drifting/wishing but not achieving what you're capable of and living consciously while focusing on the journey and not just the destination?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br><br>Your comment "Pardon all my questioning, but this is something I wanted to figure out for myself " is a very material point.  One of the strongest tools for me in identifying and setting goals IS that very act of questioning.  Where am I now?, where do I want to be?, what am I looking to achieve? etc. That is what enables me to get a handle on what is important to me and to set my goals accordingly.  However, over the past number of years, intensity of work took me away from that Thinking Time and my goals started to drift and more recently other issues have necessitated a complete rethink.<br><br>AF has given me back that Thinking Time, but not only that, by enabling me to put my goals into the lists without grading or analysing them in any way, so that they find their place and get rephrased, progressed or dismissed, what I am being left with is what is truly important to me.<br><br>It is still very much a "work in progress".  Not all of my goals have been fully restated yet, and I am aware that part of that is down to various areas of uncertainty, but also just that, until some of my backlog areas are finally gotten out of the way, it is just not the right time.  If I said that at one time I would have considered that to be classic procrastination ...."what do you mean you can't define a goal until you clear a backlog!?" but now I can see that the backlogs themselves have so much of an influence on our thought processes that in that scenario it would be too easy to state the wrong goals and therefore just set myself up to fail before I even start.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-03-9 21:45</div>
<div class="content">Christine, I can see how it would be very difficult to get clarity on the important issues until your mind was free of the noise, especially if that backlog has caused you to beat yourself up over it in the past - which it sounds like it has, even if it's on the road to being dealt with now.  So does that mean your major focus / #1 goal is clearing the backlog / getting clarity?</div>
<h2>Reply by Christine B</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-03-9 22:03</div>
<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br><br>I would have to say that clearing the backlog/getting clarity would be my "goal of choice" but that is not quite what is happening.  In another post you mentioned that having limited space can be a blessing which I can understand.  However the phrase "getting clarity" is a major factor.  Because I have limited space I cannot get all of the clutter out of sight, and therefore cannot get it out of mind either.  That has a knock on effect because visual clutter clogs the mind pretty effectively.:-)<br><br>I would have expected AF to make great inroads into my backlog and that IS happening, but not in the way I would have anticipated.  Having a backlog is a great excuse for procrastination ...... "when I clear this then I will..............." but of course it never gets cleared.  Obviously my backlog is a major issue and does need to be cleared (and with AF, for the first time ever I feel that is genuinely possible).  However AF is not treating it with the urgency I would have expected.  It seems to be naturally breaking it down into different areas, and in some cases working more on the things that caused the problem in the first place than the problem itself.  It does mean that I have periods when I flap about "my backlog" and try to force AF to "my" way of thinking, but the fact of the matter is that I just need to be patient, work with my lists and let it get done at "the right time". <br><br>As you say it is difficult to get clarity on the important issues until the mind is free of the noise, and it never helps when you haven't been the only one beating yourself up about it :-).  Getting to the point of clearance will be a big milestone!   I have to say that there have been days when the idea of an RV and the open road held great appeal!</div>
