<div class="content">I think AF4 is brilliant and works well.  But I do have some issues that I hope Mark and others can adress.  Sometimes in my position -- and I am sure this happens with many others -- I can suddenly have new and very important tasks or projects thrust into my lap that are urgent.  I know one should use common sense and just work on these as they come along, but then I am ignoring AF by doing this.  I have tried to start my day where I left off on the AF list -- and if it is in the closed section -- I usually can find plenty to do as I go round and round again the list -- all before I come to my open list that has the new, very important, and reasonably urgent items (I don't mean same day necessarily -- a new, complex project that is due in a few days let's say).  But it does not feel right to be working on things in the closed list -- they may be important, but not as important perhaps as these new items -- that are on the open list.<br><br>So how does one resolve this kind of issue?  It can happen to someone in a high-level administrative position like mine a lot.<br><br>Thanks,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">David:<br><br>I think we discussed a similar issue a while back. If you have a strong feeling that you should be doing a certain task, then go straight to it. <br><br>What you are doing is in effect saying that there are no tasks which stand out between where you are now and that task. That's perfectly within the spirit of the system.<br><br>Once you have finished working on that task, continue from it - don't go back to where you were.</div>

<div class="content">YAY, Mark has returned!  Hope you had a fun time and are all rested up!<br><br>David,<br><br>>>>  I know one should use common sense and just work on these as they come along, but then I am ignoring AF by doing this.  <<<<br><br>I look at this in two ways:<br><br>1) How could you be ingorning AF is one of AF's rules is to do what makes sense?<br><br>2) Rules, schmules ;-) ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>It is good to have you back!  Thanks for this advice, which is exactly what I thought I should do.  It is common sense and am very glad to see this is completely in the spirit of AF4.  I would suggest stating something along what you have told me in the instructions of AF4.<br><br>Mike, good comments too!  I am not so anal as to always obey every rule....but, with so much discussion on this site, I have heard Mark say many times that one has to follow the rules fairly closely or one will not gain the benefits of AF.  That is what prompted my question because I felt as if I was moving significantly out of the rules.  <br><br>Best wishes,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">David,<br><br>I agree that following some of the key rules is important.  The trouble is that sometimes it is not clear which rules are key.  In the past I have assumed some rule or other was not important but it turned out to be so after I experienced more.</div>

<div class="content">... and of course even the person who wrote the rules may not know which are the most important at the time of writing.</div>
