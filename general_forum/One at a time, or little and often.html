<div class="content">Given a bunch of tasks, is it better to do them one at a time, or a little of each?  Assume for illustration they each take four units of work. <br>SALLY:<br>aaaa (done a) bbbb ( done b ) cccc dddd<br>eeee ffff gggg hhhh (done to h)<br>FRED:<br>aba abca ( done a) bcdb ( done b)<br>cdec defd efge fghf ( done to f)<br>ghghh ( done to h) <br>GEORGE:<br>abcd efgh abcd efgh<br>abcd efgh abcd (done a,b,c and d )<br>efgh (done to h)<br><br>As illustrated above, Sally does one thing at a time.  Fred ramps up to 4 things at a time. George does everything at once. Result: Although things started slow for Fred, every 4 work units Fred completes something, same as Sally. So the real question is whether Fred is more or less efficient in switching contexts. The answer will vary.  George on the other hand is so scattered. Everything eventually is done with the same amount of effort as Sally and Fred, but each individual thing takes a long while to get from start to finish. <br><br>Seems to me the most important factor is what makes the individual work units efficient.  If you can get in the zone and complete one thing effectively, taking a sally might be the plan.   If you tire of a task, switching to Fred might be a good idea, and you will soon return to your original task fresh. But going by George and working every single item every time doesn't make sense. You lose focus, things take forever to get done, and you return to task b completely cold to what you were doing last.</div>

<div class="content">To be precise: the above illustration used 8 tasks to illustrate the point. I don't think George working on 8 tasks is a big problem. But expand that to doing 80 tasks at once, I think that's less effective than focusing ala Fred.</div>

<div class="content">Good points Alan,<br><br>I've suspected for a while that the GEORGE type scenario may be true, i.e. too many tasks, too thin the focus. <br><br>But the big question is *how* do we manage having less tasks?<br><br>Everytime I try having 1,2,3 projects, other urgently pressing stuff comes up that needs dealing with!<br><br>So how can this cycle be managed?</div>

<div class="content">I think Alan pointed out some interesting things.<br><br>There is something to keep in mind though, and that's maintenance.<br>Some things need a constant flow of work to keep them from becoming a problem.<br>These do not "disengage" us from our previous "creative" things...<br>So we do not come back cold to them.<br><br>I agree that for "Projects" proper, a certain amount of restraint should be used to keep us from juggling too many balls at once. The only thing that will result is that you'll drop a few in the process or go mad and overwhelmed. It also creates a way of thinking that says that you can put as many things on your system as you want... they will get done a certain point! This is all good if you are the only person in the universe but sometimes, people depend on the result of your actions. So speed of execution is a factor.<br><br>@Leon<br>Limit yourself!<br>Learn to say no...<br>But this needs a change of focus, a change in the way you see reality.<br><br>Urgent is all really relative.<br>It's relative to all the other engagements you have and pinning them down and understanding them if really hard to do. Once you start to limit the amount of work you are willing to take, all the things you do are of higher quality AND you start to understand why you previously thought that some things where very important while they where actually not that much :)</div>

<div class="content">Could it be related to whether the tasks can be batched or not? There's a set of articles of batching pro & con here - <a href="http://www.simpleproductivityblog.com/the-cons-of-batch-processing/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simpleproductivityblog.com/the-cons-of-batch-processing/</a> and <a href="http://www.simpleproductivityblog.com/the-pros-of-batch-processing/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simpleproductivityblog.com/the-pros-of-batch-processing/</a></div>

<div class="content">+AJPM+<br><br>Alan,<br><br>If most or all of the tasks abcdefgh are quite hard to do, then I think Fred's method is the best (and most realistic) option, if you look at it this way:<br><br>FRED:<br>(entered abcdefgh into AF) (dismisses defgh into review in a "pre-filter" tweak, realizing he cannot realistically do them now) aba abca (done a, reenters d) bcdb (done b, reenters ef) cdec defd (reenters gh) efge fghf (done to f) ghghh (done to h) <br><br>This is poster Mike's intriguing solution to this kind of dilemma in the following thread:<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/883672" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/883672</a><br><br>I am trying it now, and it looks very promising, imho.<br><br>God bless.</div>

<div class="content">Very interesting. Saving rest of that thread for later. Myself I don't prefilter, but I actively filter stuff as I pass through the list.</div>

<div class="content">+AJPM+<br><br>Sorry Alan for not putting a summary of the thread I posted, as it IS a bit long.  I will try to summarize thus:<br><br>Mike uses a "pre-filtering" tweak every time he enters an item into his AF4.  Every time he enters an item, he asks: can I do this within this week? If he thinks he can, he writes the item down and leaves it as it is.  However, if he thinks it will only languish in his AF for more than a week, he writes it down then immediately dismisses it.<br><br>His reasoning is that everything you write in your AF list is there until you change your notebook.  Even if you delete items, you do it with a line crossing them out, but you can still read them.  Therefore, you can treat AF4 as a "grasscatcher" (recorder of all your thoughts and ideas).  However, for AF4 to work most effectively, it must help you to consider only the current tasks; that is, the tasks that you can do in a specified, reasonable period of time (eg. one week).  Therefore, for sake of effectiveness, enter only the items that you most probably you can do within the said amount of time.<br><br>And here is the genius of the pre-filtering.  If you enter an item then dismiss it right away because you cannot do it within that period of time, then it is not considered during the use of AF4, but <<it is still in your AF4 list>> Probably by next week, during a review of dismissed items, you can re-enter the item and do it by then.<br><br>You can still filter during use of AF by dismissing those items, both in your closed and open lists, that will most likely will not be done in a specified period of time. Both these filtering and pre-filtering of tasks will be very helpful especially when you have an overwhelming amount of tasks to be done.<br><br>Now, you must be able to distinguish between those items that you deleted because you have done them, and those items that you have dismissed because either of the dismissal rules of AF or because of your filtering and pre-filtering.  Mark's original answer is the highlighter.  The problem with it is, as one poster puts it, it is too attention getting.  It is advantageous in the dismissed "for review" part of the AF, but in the middle of the active lists of AF it would disrupt the "standing out" of items vital for AF.  Besides, I personally dislike highlighters because I am always away from my desk and I do not like to go back to my desk regularly just because I am dismissing a few items, nor do I like carrying more than one writing implement on me always.  Therefore, Mike suggested the use of codes.  Personally, since my notebook has a small margin to the left, I write "H" (for "Highlighted") before each dismissed item, and nothing before deleted items, after crossing each out.  You can also use brackets or other codes.<br><br>The last requirement is that you must regularly review your dismissed items, or the tweak and your AF will fall apart.  Mike does a weekly review, which is why he used the current week as his period of time to consider for pre-filtering. I personally am trying the option of adding a "Review dismissed items" item in my AF.<br><br>As I said before, it is ingenious.  Even Mark, in the thread I posted above, recommends it.  As for my current use,  the results look promising.   I have placed back each item in my "Weekly/Occassional Maintenance" into my AF4, and using the pre-filtering and filtering tweaks I have no problems with the added load to my AF4.<br><br>God bless.</div>

<div class="content">I tend to use two lists. The AF list is more of a catcher. Things I expect to do in the near future go on a list I prepare weekly. "Review AF" goes on my weekly list, except for short or busy weeks.</div>

<div class="content">Another alternative is a "Someday/MayBe" list (something I still use from my GTD times). I put there everything I cannot do within the next four weeks (I'm a DWM user), or tasks I'm not sure whether I'll do them at all. Same happens to dismissed items: I either dismiss them for good or I put them on the "Someday/MayBe" list.</div>
