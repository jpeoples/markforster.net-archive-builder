<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-12-9 13:52</div>
<div class="content">When Mark laid out AF4R I had been itching for a change anyway - I'd even gone back to AF1 for about an hour.  I've been a very dedicated DWM user since it came out - for my lifestyle, the timed dismissal works MUCH better than the no-action dismissal.  That said, I've now been using AF4R through one dismissal and I'm happy enough with it that I'm going to keep using it for a while.  One think I've had to do is a slight rethinking of dismissal - at one point yesterday I had only strictly at-home things left on my "old" list so I just ignored it until I was actually at home.  As it turned out they all got dismissed anyway, but I didn't do so until I had considered and rejected them in a context where that was meaningful.  I'm also preserving a bit of a DWM escape hatch... I'm still giving new things a due date of a month from now and unfinished/recurring things 1w due dates.<br><br>So anyway...with that first dismissal I got rid of 3 things, and my current list stands at 28 old, 3 new, 8 recurring, and 17 unfinished.</div>

<div class="content">Sarah:<br><br>I'm doing the same, great minds think alike, or fools . . . ?  (;-)))))<br><br>I think DWM's bequest is that escape hatch.  I found DWM/2 the best system so far,  until AF4R came along.<br><br>It's taken two years of wonderful interactive development under Mark's inspiration and guidance.  I've tried SO many different 'personal management systems' over my many years, only the AF theme has been constant for the longest.<br><br>My score after a couple of days, personal list only, is: 24 - 21 - 8 - 2, after first dismissal (28 day scope) of 2 tasks, but it's still very early days.<br><br>There's no question in my mind that the focus on Unfinished is the key distinguishing feature.<br><br>Another of my several tweaks, which i've been using for several days or weeks, is to write Errands straight into my Moleskine pocketbook which goes with me everywhere.  Out of 59 errands entered so far (and some could be considered recurring!), 4 were cancelled, 11 remain open, the rest done.</div>

<div class="content">There were a couple of other things I meant to add that I remembered later.<br><br>One is that with the no-action dismissal rules I don't enter things on the list in the same way.  For example... if I were using DWM right now "Pack for Christmas travel" would be on my list.  I don't want to start doing it NOW but I WILL have to do it before it's up for dismissal.  Now what I do is if I think of it I put it in my calendar as an AF reminder rather than just dumping it into the list.  Don't know if that's better or worse, just different.<br><br>The other is an observation on how the system impacts the software - I use Toodledo.  For the first couple of days I wasn't checking off and re-entering recurring and unfinished items I'd worked on.  I did this because I had told the system to NOT display recently-ticked items.  Yesterday I turned on the display of recently-ticked items and have started ticking and re-entering those types of things.  I don't know if I prefer this yet... It gives me visual feedback about frequency of engagement with those tasks but it means that I have to plow through a LOT of checked-off items, particularly in my "Old" tab.</div>

<div class="content">And another thing in common!<br><br>If I'm not able to do it immediately, eg away from my computer, I'll also write . . . <br><br>REMINDER: Print CDG Eurostar link information 14/12<br><br>. . . . and then enter it into Outlook as a task with the reminder for that day.<br><br>My daily routine 'reminds' me to look at the tasks in Outlook which I've configured so only Today or Previous Day tasks are shown on my main view.<br><br>Works for me.<br><br>Toodledo: I think I understand what you mean, if you just untick the task on the screen, you have to forego the act and pleasure of striking a line through it.  It also lends credence to Mark's recent re-emphasis that writing a task down can make it 'stick', which is why my suggestion of ticking in pencil, then erasing it to re-use the original entry was probably indeed a senior moment.</div>

Another reason, is I'm waiting for Walter to make AF4R.xls, hence avoiding having to do that myself. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Update early on this Friday:<br>Old 23, New 21, Recurring 9, Unfinished 2 for my Personal list.<br><br>It's also early days with AF4R, I've been populating a host of new tasks, some of which I expect to migrate to Recurring and Unfinished.<br><br>Now going off-line to focus on three tasks on the new list and get them behind me.</div>

<div class="content"><<I've the same appreciation of DWM timed dismissal.

I'm actually surprised my new list didn't grow more from yesterday.</div>

<div class="content">Sarah:<br><br>Seems you've been clearing the Old and doing New Stuff which I have found similarly in these first few days.<br><br>Of the 15 New items entered just today, I've already done 11, not all quick tasks, but most associated with an initiative to catch up on accounting admin.  I've been specifying what each task has to be to be considered completed and not liable to be transferred to U or R.<br><br>Some may argue it's really a chain of R tasks, I don't care, I've made meaningful progress.<br><br>I've found it helps an old codger like me to use the Salami Task Technique to get into the work flow, then progress seems to come along more easily.  My version of the ST is to start the stopwatch at 5 minutes, then add another 5 minutes at each 'alarm'.  So sessions from 5 + 10  . . . .+ 35 + 40 = 3 hours.  Works for me.</div>

<div class="content">Sheesh, I just re-read my original post and it was pretty incoherent on one point, which I will try to clarify.<br><br>With DWM, any thought that occurred to me that I might want to do in the next month went on the list.  Hence the packing example - we leave on the 22nd so under AF4R it doesn't make sense to put it on the list now because it will almost certainly come up for dismissal before I want to start it.  Under DWM, though, it hangs out there and stays in my consciousness.  I'm not sure which I prefer, to be perfectly honest.<br><br>Today my "old" list once again became only things that could be done at home, so I just ignored it until I got home and have since knocked off a bunch of those tasks.  End of day stats: 5O/6N/8R/20U<br><br>At the end of the day: 5 old</div>

<div class="content">I think 'any thought' is best captured immediately in writing on the list.<br><br>I've just finished processing an Interflora order for my Mum who's 95 on Monday.  As I crossed it off, I thought of an alternative more secure way to do online shopping using another credit card I have.  It's not something I'll do very shortly, but I got it down so that the next scan will prompt me to do do anything, or nothing.<br><br>With reminders - see earlier posting of mine on this thread - I then enter the task into AF4R when Outlook reminds me, unless I have/want to do it immediately when I see the reminder.<br><br>One thing I've noticed with AF4R: I'm getting a lot of my New Tasks done quickly or within a short time span.  I'd like to think that the more careful phrasing I've been using to describe a task and its completion status has been helping.  However, it may also be that subconsciously I'm trying to steer clear as much as possible from re-entering items in the Unfinished section.</div>

<div class="content">Sarah and RogerJ:<br><br>One useful application for a single-list system like AF and its derivatives is that one can use it to take notes in meetings. What you do is to write every worthwhile point as a task.<br><br>Examples:<br><br>"J's Division made £400,000 profit this quarter"<br>"Read hand-out about safety implementation"<br>"Self to run Summer Ball this year"<br>"New Government regulations may affect market"<br>"Target for next quarter £350,000 profit"<br>"Nominations for Safety Officer to J by Monday"<br><br>Appropriate action can then be taken, such as entering in records, reading, diarising, considering implications, etc.<br><br>You can also note your thoughts as tasks during the meeting and subsequently do something about them:<br><br>"Bill: four branches in Nevada?"<br>"No biscuits again!"<br>"WEDDING ANNIVERSARY!!!!"<br>"Pick up dry cleaning"<br>"Annex A and B transposed - Why?"<br>"Kanban??"</div>

<div class="content">Mark & Sarah et al:<br><br>Mark: that's a very good suggestion, writing down points as a task or at least as an aide memoire.<br><br>Tuesday is the weekly review meeting which tends to be a bit unstructured (partly because there is no proper agenda and rarely any agreed post meeting notes (I've written them up sometimes).<br><br>So I'm adding to my Work List right now: Feed 14/12 Review Meeting tasks into AF/projects.<br><br>I think I'll keep the meeting notes on another piece of paper/non-AF notebook for now (until I can get a 7" - 9" tablet/slate that supports proper handwriting), then feed the Work List after the meeting.<br><br>The challenge will be to encapsulate the task or information in a one line phrase as we do AF tasks, but that's a worthwhile challenge, stops my propensity for verbiage.</div>

<div class="content">Meant to include: I do take my AF notebook (Moleskine Large = +/- A5) into meetings, it's useful to be able to write down 'thoughts' when my mind wanders away from the topic being discussed, especially when it's being debated in the local vernacular (currently Arabic where I am).<br><br>And if I left that notebook behind, I ALWAYS have a Moleskine pocket notebook which acts as a temporary logbook as well as the place into which I always list errands, to review whenever I leave the apartment or office.</div>

<div class="content">on the "any thought" topic... continuing to run with my "pack for Christmas travel" example (and maybe by the time we finish hashing this out, it WILL be time for me to start packing!).  Yes - I could have put it on the list when it occurred to me and actioned it (in this case, putting it in my calendar as a reminder to cycle into the list a couple of days before the trip) when it came up.  What I did in this case, though, was just skip the putting it on the list and went straight to the calendar reminder.<br><br>I do use my list in meetings, not so much to take notes but definitely to note the things that I need to follow up on / consider / etc!</div>

<div class="content">Do you have a list of things you always take? If not you could start composing it now. Of course that spoils the excitement of wondering whether you have everything.</div>

<div class="content">Right on Erik! My parents navigated life quite well I think but I rarely saw a list of things to pack. Lists for other contexts certainly, but not for packing. It was always a stImulating mental exercise to try thinking of what we needed to take and we usually did pretty well. What we forgot was rarely critical, and only a couple times did we return home after some minutes on the road.</div>
