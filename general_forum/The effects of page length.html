<div class="content">I'm curious about how the length of a page affects the number of items that get worked / dismissed and how frequently items get dismissed. When using a page with 30 lines, how does the flow of SF3 compare to when using a page of 15 or even ten lines?</div>

<div class="content">I'm also wondering about this, since I am thinking about switching from my larger Moleskine with 30 lines per page to a smaller, more portable one (using the left hand page as column 1 and the right hand one as column 2) with only 20 lines per page. Since I've only been using SFv3 for a few days, I don't have any sense of whether the fewer lines would make much of a difference. Anybody have any thoughts on this?</div>

<div class="content">My experience with AF1 and a similar system (not SFv3, yet) indicates hat longer is better, at least when comparing 10 to 30 lines. I've never tested the *upper* limit, though. After all, you could fit *hundreds* of entries on  facing pages of an unruled A4 notebook using three columns per page. Has anyone ever tried "moster" pages with an AF1/SF-like system?</div>

<div class="content">I just switched from a 22 line per page steno book to a 30 line per page Moleskine (large). I did it primarily because I don't like the line-height on the steno book. However, I can already see that I like the increase in the number of items per page and will likely not have to dismiss as much as there will more often be SOMETHING I can still do on the page before moving on. I look forward to hear what others have to say too.</div>

<div class="content">I find the extra large moleskine ideal for me using Superfocus (38 lines). The page width is also fairly spacious for the 2 columns.<br><br> I like to have has few open pages as possible so I guess more lines per page works better for me.</div>

<div class="content">leon:<br><br><< I like to have has few open pages as possible so I guess more lines per page works better for me. >><br><br>I'm using a 30-line Moleskine and at this precise moment I have 46 active tasks spread over 2.6 active pages. Considering how AF1 used to spread itself over page after page even when I was using a larger notebook, I think one of the characteristics of SuperFocus is that it tends to keep the list quite compact regardless of lines per page.</div>

<div class="content">Mark: <br><br>Agreed. I have found this to be a positive attribute of Superfocus compared with chasing an ever increasing AF list.</div>

<div class="content">When I started using SFv3 a few days ago, I used the large Moleskine with squared paper.<br><br>This has 41 horizontal lines versus the 31 of the normal ruled large Moleskine notebook; it also has the vertical lines to demarcate columns 1 and  2 easily.<br><br>I agree that SFv3 has a 'way' of compacting the list length, possibly because of the higher rate of tasks being done or dismissed per the new rules.</div>

<div class="content">I am also surprised of the small number of active pages I have. I thought I was entering too few tasks but in fact I am doing a lot of them in fact. I am putting 30 tasks per page and didn't knew some people actually put 40 or more tasks per page, this is inspiring.</div>

<div class="content">The larger size cashier moleskin I'm using gets me about 21 - 25 per page and it, for now, it seems to be working pretty well.  I'm currently running with Superfocus and I'm very happy with the lower page count.  The list appears to stay much more intact.</div>
