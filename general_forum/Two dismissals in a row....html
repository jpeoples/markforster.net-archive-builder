<div class="content">I just completed my "old" list twice in the past hour.  I don't know how it happened!  The second time, I actually created a little "problem" for myself - I didn't add any NEW items between that list becoming "old" and then its being dismissed!  So now I have an empty "new" list and no old list!  <br><br>I can't imagine this is going to happen often, so I think I'll just add things to "new" as I think of them and then tomorrow morning that will become the "old" list and I'll start a fresh "new" one.<br><br>Only this crowd would appreciate how amused I am by this turn of events.<br><br>(Off to work on some of my unfinisheds!)</div>
