<div class="content"><a href="http://www.timeleft.info/" rel="nofollow">http://www.timeleft.info/</a><br><br>I heard about this from a poster on David Allen's site. I've been using it for a few days and it's perfect for timing, counting down, being reminded every x minutes, etc. If you like timed bursts and other tricks for monitoring behavior, check it out.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Moises<br><br>I like to have a beep which sounds more frequently the closer one gets to the scheduled time. E.g. for a ten minute burst, it would go after 5m, 2m 30s, 1m 15s etc. It helps me pace myself and  round things off in good time. Could TimeLeft achieve the same end?<br><br>I've been unable to find a program online to do this so wrote one :-)</div>

<div class="content">Laurence,<br><br>I've only used it a few days, and I certainly haven't used all its capabilities. You can create multiple tiny digital clocks that count down (or up) and sit on your desktop on top of all the other applications. So, I suppose you could create one countdown timer that goes off at 7:25:00pm, another for 7:27:30pm, another for 7:29:00pmj, another for 7:29:45pm, and another for 7:30:00pm and enable a (different?) sound for each of them. <br><br>The thing is, there is a digital timer staring out from your computer the whole time.</div>

<div class="content">I like this one: <a href="http://theinsomniacsociety.com/timer.html" rel="nofollow">http://theinsomniacsociety.com/timer.html</a><br><br>I especially like it because it shows the timer in the tab, so you don't have to leave it on the timer page.  It has a check box it you want an alert pop-up box or not.  It doesn't however, do all the beeping.<br><br>Thanks.</div>
