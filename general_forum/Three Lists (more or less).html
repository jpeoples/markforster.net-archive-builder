<div class="content">I'm trying to figure out how to organize my tasks with AF4. I'm using a windows program (Tudumo) to handle everything now, but I'm surprised to find I'd rather use paper.<br>Here are the types of tasks I have:<br><br>School<br>   - Planning (40%)<br>   - @School (18%)<br>   - Errands (2%)<br><br>Personal<br>   - Errands (3%)<br>   - @Home (12%)<br>   - Other (25%)<br><br>If I put everything on one big list, I end up having to ignore my "personal" tasks at school which screws up the AF4 rules. Since I am a teacher, I do a lot of my planning at home, so I can't leave my school list at school. Add in the fact that most of my tasks can be done right now, but must be done by X (which is usually between 0 and 45 days out). I also hate having to look through pages of tasks (on multiple lists) to get all my errands done together. I have tried writing the due dates and an errand symbol, but it really clutters up the list and interferes with the flow.<br><br>Right now I am using Tudumo to take care of due dates and to filter contexts, but I still feel like paper could be more efficient (for reasons that have been discussed by everyone elsewhere).<br><br>Using paper, this is the best I could think of:<br>One notebook for "school" and another for "personal" using symbols and due dates. Errands go on my phone.<br>But that is three lists; seems like more trouble than it is worth.<br><br>Is there a better way to handle this? How are you dealing with multiple lists, contexts and due dates?<br><br></div>

<div class="content">I also work at school (university) and at home and at my studio.<br>And I have no trouble with one list which has home and personal and work tasks on it. <br><br>But I have a lot of discretionary time during the day and so the lines between work-work and personal work are very fluid. I can easily do a lot of personal tasks duing the day and I do a lot of work tasks during the evening.<br><br>Your situation may be very different, but here is how I approach things with one list.<br><br>I'm using AF4 and I keep my list in OmniFocus on my laptop and it syncs with my iPhone via MobileMe. (Having one list, and keeping it in sync and always with me, is a dream come true.<br><br>I have some workflows which keep my Autofocus list at a managable (for me) size:<br><br>I keep separate lists for shopping, unless there's an item that's crucial for a project and then it may go on my AF4 list. For example, if there's a cable that I need or I need supplies before work can continue. Or, I may put (Class name) shopping on my AF4 list because I'm responsible for supplies for a classroom and so I keep a running list on my  phone and do that shopping when the time is ripe.<br><br>All classes (that I teach) and work meetings and student appointments (as well as personal appointments) are on my calendar, not on my AF4 list. The only thing that would go on my AF4 list would be "Prep for meeting with x".<br><br>I have multiple pending projects and I'll just put "Work on X" on my AF4 list. If I'm nor sure what to do next on Project X or have competing things I could do I have lists in my project files where I do project planning and keep track of future tasks and set priorities. When an aspect of Project X must be done before other areas of project X can proceed, then I'll put that particular task on my AF4 list.<br><br>Any project with a hard due date--a grant proposal, for example--is calendared and I'll also put "Work on proposal Y" on my AF4 list. I'm a little and often person on complex tasks and so that entry might get crossed off and repeated countless times. And depending on when the deadline is, I also use time-blocking on my calendar to make sure that I have an appropriate number of longer work sessions scheduled.<br><br>I have "task routines" for at home for the beginning and end of the workday (house, garden, pets), and those deal with most of my home tasks, so they don't go on my AF4 list either. (Unless the laundry has really piled up or the refrigerator is about to walk away from me or the cats are threatening a strike if I don't go buy cat food and then I'll put "Laundry!" on my AF4 list.)<br><br>I don't use contexts for my tasks, since for me the context is either obvious or irrelevant. I know I can't drain the hot tub unless I'm at home in the day time, but I might be writing or grading or reading anywhere.<br><br>Don't know if any of this helps, but this is how I manage my lists.</div>

<div class="content">Yes, the way Liz does it is much the same way I do.  I don't sync to a computer, however.  I am paper based but am experimenting running AF4 on my iPhone using ListOmni.  I've not done it long enough to draw any conclusions yet.<br><br>Basically the KEY points for me are:<br><br>- Use ONLY ONE book.<br><br>- Keep the book with me at all times.<br><br>- Keep symbols and codes to a minimum (I mostly put due dates and completion dates at the end of the items.  I'm not sure if I'll keep putting completion dates ... they might come in handy.)<br><br>- Don't put project STEPS on the list ... just "Work on X" with a page for my planning on project x in the back of the book, or other files or books at home.  I seldom have to consult project notes as once I plan a project I usually remember what I have to do.<br><br>- Keep other lists separate (but in the same book): Shopping, books I want to read, errands to run, things to talk with my wife about, etc.<br><br>- Keep ticklers and appointments on a calendar if possible --- the cell phone is ideal for this as I can be alerted.  If using a paper calendar, I keep looking at it during the day.  Actually, with ticklers I usually put them on a tickler LIST first, then only put them on a calendar if they are within range of the calendar.  So I don't have my passport renewal on a paper calendar as it is four years away.  The value of a list for me is that I have all tickler items in one place for quick review when I get those moments where a voice in my head is nagging at me that I might be forgetting something important.  ;-)<br><br>I've been at this a lot of years now and the one thing I know will cause trouble is keeping multiple lists.  I never know what I wrote were.  Here is an example of where a failure in discipline makes it all go terribly wrong.  I needed to make a call and have reference material material available (reference numbers, names and dates, etc.)  I wound up looking in the following places:<br><br>- Notes in the cell phone calendar<br>- Notes in the cell phone contact list entry<br>- Notes in a computer document on EverNote<br>- Notes in my project list<br>- Hell, I probably looked under sleeping cats ;-)<br><br>It was no big deal, but it surely aggravated me that I was not using a consistent system to keep these things at hand.  Any one of them is probably as good as any other, but too many choices confuses things, I find.<br><br>I don't know if you found any help in the "stalagmite/stactite" method or writing home and work stuff in different colored inks, or flipping the book over and working from the back with one of the lists.  People here have tried most everything ;-)</div>
