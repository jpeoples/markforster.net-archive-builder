<div class="content">Did anyone implement "Do It Tomorrow" on Evernote?</div>

<div class="content">I have done it. Are you familiar with "The Secret Weapon," a tagging-based setup of GTD? I re-modeled it for DIT. The .What categories were where I put my Will Do List and Task Diary. I put my Overdue, Today, Tomorrow, and Later tags in the .When tag category. I put @home and @work tags in the .Where tag category, etc. Basically, it's just what it sounds like - The Secret Weapon for DIT instead of GTD.</div>

<div class="content">I engineered my implementation (which might seem over the top) to meet my manager's desire for a weekly log of what I accomplished. I rather like using it and it helps me track a lot of what happens at work.<br><br>Ingredients:<br>* I created a notebook called "My Job Templates" with 8 notes. Seven of the notes are labeled as:<br>2015-00-01 Mon<br>2015-00-02 Tue<br>and so on.<br>I include Saturday and Sunday for those rare occasions I work on the weekend.<br><br>* The 8th note is the "Will-Do List" and simply contains a bulleted list of regular maintenance items (check @Action mail folder, check outstanding worklog tasks, etc.)<br><br>* Each daily template has the following structure:<br>TASKS<br>MEETINGS/EVENTS<br>WAITING ON<br>ROUTINES<br>LOG<br><br>* Under TASKS, I have a list of checkboxes. In Windows, press Ctrl+Shift+C to create a checkbox. The very first item is boldface "CI -- THE CURRENT INITIATIVE" and that's where the very first thing I need to do that day goes. If there's a routine item that needs to be done every Monday, then that task is boldface.<br><br>* MEETINGS, WAITING ON, and ROUTINES also have 2 or 3 lines of empty checkboxes.<br><br>* I selected and exported the daily logs to an Evernote file that sits on my desktop (I keep my desktop pretty clean so I can always find it). Whenever I change the templates to account for a new routine or new responsibilities, I export the files again.<br><br>* I have a notebook titled "My Work Logs". This and the My Job Templates notebook are in the same stack.<br><br>* Create and save a search for all UNchecked checkboxes. I named mine "To-dos - MY JOB". The search command for me is: notebook:"My Work Logs" todo:false. Run this saved search and you'll always see all the notes in the notebook that have unchecked checkboxes.<br><br>Whew!<br><br>Those are the ingredients, here's the recipe:<br><br>1. On Monday mornings, I drag the Evernote export file from the desktop to the My Work Logs notebook. The daily log templates sort to the top of the notebook (I reverse-sort the notebook by note title).<br><br>2. I rename all the template note titles to the actual day, so "2014-06-25 Wed". It's a little tedious, but not too bad. This is all a Monday morning ritual for me that eases me into the week.<br><br>3. I consult my work's Outlook calendar and my personal Google calendar and fill in meetings, appointments, etc in the MEETINGS/EVENTS sections.<br><br>4. I am in charge of some standing meetings, so they're already entered in the template for that day. If we don't meet that week, I simply delete those lines.<br><br>5. The CI for Monday is "CI -- copy/weed open tasks from last week, Waiting-Ons". I run the saved search and see all the notes from last week that have unchecked tasks, or things I'm waiting on that didn't arrive. I decide at that time whether to add new tasks, transfer tasks or Waiting Ons, dismiss the tasks, etc. The goal is for that search to come up empty.<br><br>6. After this laborious detail, we now get to the DIT part of your question :) If a new task appears, and I decide it doesn't need to be done today, then it goes in the next day's TASKS section. <br><br>7. I use the LOG area to track my time on tasks, phone calls, impromptu meetings, etc. <br><br>8. Do the work. Check off the boxes. <br><br>8a. The Will-Do List note is linked to one or two specific days and is a checkbox task. Click the link to display the Will Do list, do the items, go back to that day's note and check the box for "Process Will-Do List."<br><br>9. At the end of the day, delete all the empty lines, transfer undone tasks to the next day (or not -- it's up to me), decide what the CI for tomorrow will be, edit the CI for tomorrow, and go home.<br><br>10. At the end of the week, when I write up my weekly log for my manager (I use an Outlook template I created, of course -- automate!), I simply review each day's notes for the checked tasks, checked meetings, etc., write up what I did, and Robert's your father's brother -- I have a painlessly compiled weekly log.<br><br>11. Any undone tasks on Friday I leave unchecked so that they show up when I prep next week's daily log files.<br><br>I've been using this (what sounds even to me after finally typing it all out) somewhat laborious process for quite a while now -- I have 213 daily log notes. I guess I like it because it's mine -- it's adapted to my workplace needs, helps me track what I need to track, and doesn't get in my way. It evolved over a period of months and I've settled into using it with no changes for a long time. It's just enough tech and just enough hand-sifting of tasks for my comfort level.<br><br>I also keep a lined pad on the desk that holds the myriad ad-hoc smaller tasks or dismissed tasks from the daily logs or tasks that I just can't get to today or this week. I will sometimes use the randomizer method on these items, and they may feed into the daily logs -- I don't have a terribly rigorous process, I'm afraid. The pad serves as the catch-all for everything, while the Evernote daily work logs focus just on today. For my job situation, it works great.<br><br>Sorry for the insane detail, but that's why we're here!</div>

<div class="content">This is what the implementation I described earlier looks like. Say it is the beginning of the work day. You use control-click to select the @work and !Daily tags, which gives you your daily work will-do list. When you reach "task diary" on that list, you switch to selecting @work and Today, and these are your task diary tasks for today at work. As new work tasks come in, you tag them with @work, Task Diary, and Tomorrow. You get the idea. One of your daily will-do tasks needs to be that you switch all your "tomorrow" tasks to "today," "today" to "overdue" (if there are any), and so on.<br><br><a href="http://www.dropbox.com/s/aedab82ovhw00ia/DIT_Evernote.JPG" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.dropbox.com/s/aedab82ovhw00ia/DIT_Evernote.JPG</a></div>

<div class="content">Here is a simplified version that removes some of the redundancy from the earlier one. You just select one .Context and one .List at a time, together, using control-click. As you can see, I've started using it today for my tasks on my trip (for which I created a temporary context @trip that I'll delete later).<br><br><a href="http://www.dropbox.com/s/bds47twht01m6t7/DIT_Evernote_Simplified.JPG" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.dropbox.com/s/bds47twht01m6t7/DIT_Evernote_Simplified.JPG</a></div>
