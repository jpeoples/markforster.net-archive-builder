<div class="content">Mark is in the midst of a series of blog posts that offer a new twist on the old Important/Urgent Eisenhower decision matrix. As I understand it, one should strive to have only Important tasks on one's list, and do them in order of Urgency. While I am coming to understand the logic of this approach, I have negative feelings associated with the terms Important and Urgent, perhaps from the baggage they have accumulated in earlier TM systems and critiques thereof. These adjectives also have too many syllables. :-)<br><br>So what if we use the adjectives Prime and Ripe instead?  List your Prime tasks, and do each when it is Ripe for doing.</div>

<div class="content">I like the suggestion and will try it for myself, but I doubt it will be widely adopted. <br><br>For myself I think a shift in vocabulary can give a different sense and connotation. For myself I had been experimenting with "Soon" and "Postpone" (or "Neglect" if I wanted to emphasise my choices, commitments or default decisions to avoid things). For me "Urgent" is more driving oneself with determination and "ripe" is more in line with intuition letting matters stand out - doing what you feel like doing when you feel like doing it. These issues are the "backstory" to autofocus and superfocus it seems to me. The difference between chronos (clock time) and kairos (the opportune moment) - where value and meaning meet the calendar and the clock. Imagine a Venn diagram, chronos overlapping kairos. The intersection is the "sweet spot" of ripeness.</div>

<div class="content">I don't know if it's the same in American English, but in British English describing something as "ripe" has the connotation of a bit overripe and smelly!<br><br>"That cheese is a bit ripe".<br><br>"So are your socks!"</div>

<div class="content">MarK : i believe that is one sense of it but according to <a href="http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/ripe" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/ripe</a><br><br>adjective<br><br>    1(of fruit or grain) developed to the point of readiness for harvesting and eating: a ripe tomato<br>    (of a cheese or wine) fully matured: a ripe Brie<br>    (of a smell or flavour) rich, intense, or pungent: rich, ripe flavours emanate from this wine<br><br>    2 having arrived at the fitting stage or time for a particular action or purpose): land ripe for development they felt that the time was ripe for a new approach<br><br>When the fruit is ripe, it drops from the tree by itself. One moment it hangs by a thread from the branches of the tree. The next moment it falls--not because it has been forced to fall, or has made the effort to jump, but because the tree of life has recognized its ripeness and simply let it go. <br><br>For me "forcing" vs "allowing" is roughly "driving" vs "what feels ready to be done?". One is tense, one is relaxing and in harmony with one's mood and inclinations. Perhaps "plucking" (joke).<br><br>In NLP energy that is ripe may feel bigger, bolder, steadier, closer, more solid, more present, more dense and touchable, juicier, tender, ready! <br><br>Energy that is not ripe can feel further away, more mushy, hazier, smaller, more ethereal...not here yet. I suggest stepping into it, trying it on, feeling it. Try noticing the difference in how you represent the two within your being.</div>

<div class="content">Mark I believe is correct about the British connotation of ripe, though that use is rare over here. I think Readiness is a more friendly term, but it doesn't capture Mark's intention for urgency.  Hot is a better synonym for Urgent. <br><br>Prime (as in primed) is another synonym for Ready, but used as Primacy it's a synonym for Important. So that isn't a good choice. Key?<br><br>I don't favor any of these words except Important.</div>

<div class="content">Maybe in order to avoid the existing connotations of words, the answer is to give them entirely new names without any existing meaning.<br><br>So in place of urgent, ripe, hot, I will rename it wugmug<br><br>And in place of important, primed, ready, we will have subblemubble.<br><br>So just to make it clear the best way to prioritise is by the degree of wugmug, and the degree of wugmug is allocated according to the task's subblemubble to you.<br><br>Everyone clear?</div>

<div class="content">If you seek to be understood it's imperative you explain yourself in detail (which you are doing).  There probably isn't a word that unambiguously identifies your new ideas.<br><br>Without explanation, people will assume urgency equates to due date.  With your last five blog entries, people would understand regardless of word choice.</div>

<div class="content">"Ripe" makes perfect sense to me, but "prime" is a non-starter. Also, "prime" has 4 out of 5 letters in common with "ripe," which to me makes it visually confusing. I tried but did not come up with anything more compelling than "prime," or "subblemubble" for that matter.<br><br>However, I see nothing wrong with "ripe" and "important."<br><br>Myself, I have often made a list labeled "timely," for things with a rough window of opportunity but no specific deadline.<br><br>"Important" and "Timely"?<br><br>time*ly - adj. Done or occurring at a favorable or useful time; opportune: "a timely warning"</div>

<div class="content">Just for completeness, as well as Prime and Ripe dismissal should be replaced with "stale" ;-)<br><br>Prime -> Ripe -> Stale - like a bell curve of readiness</div>

<div class="content">Subblemubble ("ripe") just sounds like another way of saying "it stands out".</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim,<br><br>You wrote << "ripe" just sounds like another way of saying "it stands out". >><br><br>That was intentional.  But something might also stand out because it is Urgent in a bad way; i.e., the Deadline is imminent.  In that case, I would describe the task not as ripe to be done, but overripe, almost spoiled or rotten (overdue).  So Ripe means that it is the right time to do it, neither too soon nor too late. This idea is similar to Mark's "Urgent to start" concept.</div>
