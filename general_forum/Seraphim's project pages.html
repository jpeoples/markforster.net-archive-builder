<div class="content">Seraphim, I've been thinking about projects and how you had handled them earlier.  <br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1600928" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1600928</a><br><br>Has this worked out for you longterm?  Are you still doing this sort of thing?  If not, did it fail at some point, or was there no compelling reason away from it?<br>I'm not referring to the AF1 style process but the mingling of movable projects .</div>

<div class="content">I still mix them in.  For example, I was still using these with "AutoDIT".<br><br>Recently, I've changed it a little.  When I come across a project page, I try very hard to find all the "next items", and then choose the main ones that stand out and put them on the main list.   <br><br>This works pretty well and I can get a lot done that way.<br><br>But sometimes there are too many scattered items and I start to feel lost.  For example, I get 12 emails from coworkers related to the project, and that changes everything I need to do related to the project.  I need to pull it all together again and re-evaluate.<br><br>If that happens, I move each scattered task back to its project page, and reinsert the project page into the intermixed AF1 sequence.     When I come to the project page during the course of processing the list, I sort through it all, figure out the "next items",  etc., just like I wrote at the beginning of this comment.</div>

<div class="content">Thank you Seraphim!  I have identified 8 ongoing projects, and planned out key steps.  I'll be integrating these into my day much as you describe here.</div>
