<div class="content">If you do a task that you weren't planning on doing -- a task which was NOT on any of your lists -- ,  does the task in some way get entered onto the Autofocus list (i.e. having finished working on the task do you now enter it at the end?)</div>

<div class="content">If in doubt, write it down.<br><br>You nether know what kind of new chain of tasks will be triggered by the task you just finished. <br><br>You can't be perfect, but you can be accountable.<br></div>

<div class="content">I'd agree with Rainer on that, in that I will sometimes write down a task that I've already done.  It sounds a bit strange and I don't do it for everything obviously, but I have found that there are tasks that do seem to have an intrinsic value, not in a way that we can necessarily define, but that somehow have a knock on effect.  Difficult to describe but if I go back to my stack/unstack the dishwasher analogy, that was a task I put on my list primarily because I had a resistance to it (as well as it being something that needed doing of course). By AFing it I identified the reason for the resistance and have not had the item on my list since.  I think we somehow know what items fall into that category, even if we can't necessarily identify why at the time we put it on our list.  Hope that makes some sort of weird sense ?  .... :-)</div>

<div class="content">Christine B. I agree with you.<br><br>And also, when I do a task that is not in my list and it is not a "common sense" task I have the feeling that I am deceiving myself like those who are on a diet where nothing is forbidden ( as I  did recently) and they "steal" something to eat. Yes, I can do  and then, write the task later.</div>

<div class="content">I would not write it down unless I had a reason to want to record it, and since I use a disposable book for AF, it will not help to write it there in that case anyway.  I think it all depends on what you see as the purpose of using AF to be.  For me it is a way to manage actions so I don't particularly care what was done, so much as what I want to do.  Therefore, I don't use the list to record things for posterity.  ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Ooops, hit send too soon ;-)<br><br>There is one obvious exception ... if you did not COMPLETE the task, you write it down because there is more to do.  It then becomes like a task that was on the list in the first place that you worked on and partially completed ... you add it to the end of your list.  But then, obviously, you only write it once!  LOL ;-)  You don't write it down, cross it off, then write it down again because it was incomplete!  This could get rather bizarre of you let the list become your reason for living!  ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike<br><br>One of the things I like about AF is that it is infinitely flexible as to what tasks you enter, and I think that, to a fairly considerable extent, the tasks we list will be linked to the benefits we perceive or need at any given point in time.  Certain tasks I will do automatically, at other tasks those same tasks will find their way onto my lists.  The reason for that is really nothing to do with the task itself but my own mental attitude to it at the time.<br><br>It's more akin to the resistance aspect of the task.  If I have a resistance to a task, I know that the very act of putting it on my list will force me to confront the reasons for that resistance, but in a safe and non-threatening way.  Rather than the "I don't want to think about that, I'd rather just grit my teeth and do it" approach, we can identify the reason for the resistance in an "oh, that's interesting" sort of way and we then have the choice whether to do anything about it or not.  But at least we then know we are making that choice.........<br><br></div>

<div class="content">If I do a task not on my list, I immediately write it down & check it off. It feels good to know I'm getting stuff done :-)</div>

<div class="content">Same for me: I add to AF list, and mark as done, as a good way to remember I did it and possibly continue on with another task if not totally completed.<br><br></div>
