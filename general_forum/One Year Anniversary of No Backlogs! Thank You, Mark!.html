<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">Hi all<br>I know this sounds like I'm tooting my own horn, and perhaps, I might be a little bit.....But, the main thrust of this post is from a position of unending gratitude to Mark Forster.  My original tag was Clogged Like a Diaper In A Toilet!  LOL!  I was buried beyond belief!  All my life, I've been regarded as highly ordered and methodical, yet, also highly creative.  After the auto accident, I've been referred to many negative labels primarily focusing on my brain injuries.  I didn't have any idea what to do.  Somehow, I found many organizing sites, procrastinating sites, anything I could think of to re-educate myself in a desperate attempt to regain some modicum of peace of mind and reliability.  I was directed to this site from a couple of Yahoo Groups.  Mark guided me out of my huge backlog even though I have trouble remembering what I read.  I've read DIT at least a dozen times and it still feels like a new book each time I refer to it....but somehow, via re-reading his book, visiting this site with regularity and following the DIT yahoo group, it started to sink in on a largely subconsious level and using my index card reminders.  <br><br>This is my anniversary date that I've felt the benefits of following Mark's System guidelines and from reading his blog.  I love Evernote and iscrybe that he recommended as well as doing test runs with his various suggestions.  True, my brain is similar to a  both a colander and a kaleidoscope due to injuries and pain from spinal cord injuries....yet, finally, I'm not afraid anymore!  Mark has given me tools to trust myself enough so that nothing huge will ever fall through the cracks at the worst and well ahead of things at best.  Usually, I'm content with staying current with my Will Do List (and it's subsets), moving forward with my current initiatives and my creative instincts growing far beyond my actual capacities....but that's OK with me.  It beats the hell out of being chronically scared and overwhelmed and berating myself because I'm disabled.  I still don't enjoy be disabilities, but I no longer hate myself for them either.  <br>Thank You, Mark....from the bottom of my heart.  You have quite literally given me my life back....moreover, you have restored my faith in both myself and in my future.  God is surely smiling on you!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Hi, Jojo<br><br>I suggest you try filling in the Checklist on p. 202. Then concentrate on the items which you haven't ticked.<br><br>Mark</div>

<div class="content">I looked at page 202 and it basically boils down to having too much to do. Problem is, I just can't seem to find a way to get rid of all of my commitments.</div>

<div class="content">Hi, Jojojo<br><br>Since I don't know anything about your circumstances it is difficult to advise you here. However there's lots of good advice in the book about how to cut your commitments - particularly in Chapter 5 "Real Work v. Busy Work" (p. 67).<br><br>If you let me know more about your exact circumstances, I can give you more specific advice.<br><br>Mark</div>
