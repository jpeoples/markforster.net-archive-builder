<div class="content">The current initiative method is definitely working for me. Though I must say it is hard to keep myself to it EVERY morning. <br><br>I tend to check email first, then check the news, then maybe start my current initiative.<br><br>Does anyone have any advice or tips on doing it first thing every morning?<br><br>Jon</div>

<div class="content">I'm with you there.  I'm so bleary eyed in the morning and I don't come round until I've had a coffee and watched morning news.  Then I have to get ready for work.  I'm better at the weekend.  I can get round to my current initiative then, but it would be nice to do something more constructive in the mornings.</div>

<div class="content">Hi, Sandy<br><br>I assume from what you've said about your current initiative that this a personal one, not a work one.<br><br>If this is the case, then you might find it easier to work on the initiative when you finish work in the evening, rather than in the morning.</div>
