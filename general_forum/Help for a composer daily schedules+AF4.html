<div class="content">Jacob,<br><br>A few thoughts:<br><br>- Why does AF4 "make" you work on the big project all day?  If you "feel" like working all day long on the big project, then perhaps that is what you should be doing.  Otherwise, if you feel like switching, AF4 accommodates that.<br><br>- The AF system(s) all work best with discretionary time.  So if you want to schedule, then block time for things you feel should be scheduled, then block time to work you AF list.<br><br>- Consider what some call the Pomodoro method.  Basically, just run a stopwatch on yourself and work in spurts of 10, 15, 20 (or how ever many) minutes.  Whatever seems right.  So don't worry about time, but have in your AF list "1 hour piano", "1 hour lyrics", or whatever, then keep a timer to make you stop and return to the list and pickup what is next.  If you run the list items on timers, then you'll get back to the "piano" one again soon enough.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike<br>Thanks for your input, really appreciated !<br><br>"- Why does AF4 "make" you work on the big project all day?.."<br><br>well...because it is often more fun or "easy" to do than working with more basic stuff.<br>I tend to choose this work on behalf of the groundwork which is very important in the long run.<br>If I only do what i "feel", i would never get a pool of ready lyrics...<br>Also, if I do a little each day, my subconcious brain works the rest of the time,<br><br>"- The AF system(s) all work best with discretionary time...."<br><br>Yeah, I understand I´m working against the idea of AF !<br><br>"So don't worry about time, but have in your AF list "1 hour piano", "1 hour lyrics", or whatever, then keep a timer to make you stop and return to the list and pickup what is next."<br><br>This is a very simple and usefull tip !<br>I´ll try your suggestions with the aim of doing some work every day..<br><br>Thanks<br>Jacob</div>

<div class="content">When a musician engages with the outside world there can be a lot of admin. Yet using AF4 can help pose some useful questions to you - it is a good tool for self-observation. For example, if you were working on the big project all the time, AF4 would, as your closed list reduced to only the things you have been neglecting, ask you to decide if you really want to do them. You might then add to your AF list, "Think about how to create more disposable time".<br><br>If you are using the system, you might consider dropping the planning (8:30 - 9) and office work (just put Email, Tidy, Phone X back, etc, at the end of the list). The more you destructure your day the more freedom the system has to work.<br><br>Sometimes admin will outweigh creative time, but at others you may want to work at the piano all day. And maybe sometimes you just give the songwriting 5 minutes, but it might be an inspired 5 minutes.<br><br>At the moment your subconscious has been trained to expect only one hour a day for the crucial activity of basic songwriting (9:00-10:00), why not let the Muse know you are always available should She come tapping at the door?<br><br>Hope this helps.</div>
