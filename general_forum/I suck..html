<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-01-26 21:02</div>
<div class="content">I did my first day of auto focus a week and a half after the instructions.<br><br>I read the instructions, dismissed them as a load of rubbish. Followed the forum, warmed to the idea. Then started thinking how awesome it was and I was going to kick ass using Auto Focus. Then fussed over notebooks.<br><br>Then I finally did my first day of Autofocus. It went okay. Was unhappy with that I had achieved (although i never seem to be able to focus and get much done in a day anymore) and was a little concerned I hadn't touched my main project. <br><br>I decided there was a lot of filler stuff that had to be taken care off first and AutoFocus was helping me get rid of that, once it was done I perhaps would have complete focus on the main task, so I need not worry about it too much. I also considered  different ideas for the future. Perhaps a master project list that i spent some fixed time on per day (when i felt like it as the spirit of AutoFocus) and then keep AF for everything else. just things like that.<br><br>To this day, I haven't used AutoFocus since. Not that I don't like it, I haven't used any other system or really done anything. I've just felt stuck, felt I have had to figure some stuff out I'm concerned, I just want to do things right, do great things. But I seem to have forgotten how to do anything!</div>

<div class="content">Smarky:<br><br>No system is going to work if you don't use it!<br><br>You say that you were unhappy with what you achieved on the day you tried AF. How did that day compare in productivity with other days? Did you achieve more, less or the same?</div>

<div class="content">I know, I know. I guess I have "issues" beyond any time management system.<br><br>I was perhaps as productive as I get at the moment. So I guess the system wasn't bad at all =P <br><br>In fact I was more productive than any day since I didn't use it. I'm planning on starting it again tomorrow!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Smarky<br><br>Sounds like you've just been having a bad day that's all!  And probably need a holiday. :-)<br><br>Try taking an hour (or more) off to completely relax and then, pretend you've not read anything about AF, so don't get hung up on what notebook/pen/digital option you are going to use, just grab any old notebook and a pen (or pencil!) re-read the original instructions and start writing!  Don't think too much about anything, just start on whatever takes your fancy ......<br><br>Good luck!</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Christine.<br><br>I have found that I originally started writing my list 1 1/2 pages then stopped and since then - several weeks! - have just done what has occured to me without referring to the original list - I have a bad habit of doing this i.e. working ad hoc or in my head. Looks like I will have to start again and read the instructions!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Nick<br><br>The great thing about Autofocus is that it works exactly as per the instructions - it seems almost too simple but it does work!  I also tend to work ad hoc or in my head but every time I leave my lists and start doing that those old feelings of anxiety start to pop up.  However it works, the "system" is the key - using the lists, both for doing and for noting down every task that springs to mind (without grading it it).  Remember to use the pages exactly as Mark describes and take time to recognise what it feels like for an item to "stand out". <br><br>Best of luck!</div>

<div class="content">I also have the habit of throwing myself into an idea as soon as it pops into my head -- mainly because I have always been afraid that if I didn't act on it immediately, I would lose it, since I didn't have a trustworthy system.<br><br>But now, I just add it to the AF list.  And I am SO GLAD that I do that!  When I finally do come across that idea on the AF list, half the time I think, "what a hare-brained idea, what in the world was I thinking?", and I am so glad that I didn't waste a couple hours taking action on it immediately.  The "thrill" of that idea has completely gone, and is replaced by the thrill of doing what's really important to me instead.<br><br>When I come to that item in the AF list, and I still want to do it, that means it *wasn't* a hare-brained idea (or at least, not so much of one), and I have the AF system to help me track it and prioritize it.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim<br><br>And don't you find sometimes that by the time you get to that item somehow your subconscious has aolready been at work on it and the way to do it just flows?  I've lost track of the number of times I've addressed certain issues or projects in the past and left them part way through; now my approach to those same tasks is so different.  The actions may be the same but the difference in approach makes them feel fresh and new -and achievable!</div>

<div class="content">Christine, yes that's the way it works for me, too.  :-)</div>
