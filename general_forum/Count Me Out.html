<div class="content">I am throwing in the towel. Give me back my standard DIT.<br><br>AF for me was too much like a bad version of GTD: huge overwhelming pages of lists. Too much time searching and flipping through pages. My "intuition" didn't help me with GTD and it's not helping me with AF.<br><br>The last day and 3/4 were pretty hectic. Great opportunity to test the system. And it failed me (or I failed it).<br><br>I recognize that I am one in a thousand. It stands to reason that different people have different work environments, different character dispositions, and different tolerances. Thank goodness Mark created standard DIT for people like me.<br><br>Tomorrow I am ditching my AP notebook and going back to my nice, manageable, everything-on-one page, standard DIT list. I can't wait.</div>

<div class="content">Moises:<br><br>Are you sure you were doing it right? The description you give of huge overwhelming pages of lists, plus tons of time searching and flipping through pages doesn't sound remotely like the way Autofocus should be working.<br><br>I would advise you to read the instructions carefully again and then build your list organically in the way I recommend in the instructions.</div>

<div class="content">I must admit I am really struggling with this system too.<br><br>I just seem to have a big long list which isn't really going anywhere - I am still feeling huge resistance to all the tasks that I don't want to do - but am happy to be drawn to nice simple tasks - which surely is what DIT is trying to avoid?<br><br>I am happy to keep going to see what happens - but I can see me going back fairly soon as this just is not motivating me I have to say!<br><br>If anyone's happy to tell me where I'm going wrong I'm more than happy to be corrected.  Don't get me wrong Mark, I am willing to try, really I am!</div>

<div class="content">I am not sure if I am doing it right, but I am feeling very excited.<br>- first: I am not looking at my list, but things are getting done. I "know" what to do next. I am surprised how it is working.<br>- I only wrote two pages of tasks. I have loads of tasks to be done, but thought this would be enough. Yesterday I had a wonderful day -  only one error, I kept working till later hours. ;-)<br>So today I will apply MF's  recommendation: "On your point about the end of the day, I suggest you do what it says in the instructions, i.e. have a definite stop time."<br>...<br>Have one question:<br>- yesterday I did something that was not in my list and there was no need to be done. How to deal with this? Should I write it in Autofocus or should I ignore as in closed list?<br><br>Comparing it with GTD, there is no stress in ordering things and spending a lot of time on the system. Autofocus seems to me to be a good collect with action following it.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Having completed a lot of tasks (and I do think it is important to include those nice simple tasks) I have found tat the completed tasks included some that i had previoulsy resisted.  However, with a relatively small number of items on Page 1 I found I was resisting many of them.  I knew I could not allow the system to reject them as they were important, but I was not feeling a pull to them.  As I know that for me the system works I then asked why I was feeling like this.  The conclusion I came to was that i was looking at these items from a pre Autofocus perspective.  For example, under DIT I had a backlog list, which although significantly reduced using DIT contained a lot of items with a negative "feeling" attached.  My task was listed as "clear backlog list".  The result was that I still had the same resistance.  By separating that list to individual items it now has a completely different feel. <br><br>I'm not sure if that is of help but before giving up have a look at the items you are resisting, ask why, and see if they can be split or rephrased .........</div>

<div class="content">I agree to some extent about Moises and Jason are saying. That was certainly my initial concern. However my overriding impression at the moment is that Autofocus has unstuck a lot of the bigger jobs/projects (that were on a waiting list before, for several months). Although these projects had no deadline attached, they were causing me some worry as they did need sorting out.  It does feel much more intuitive to me, very fluid. I also like the fact that you can add a task very quickly when in the middle of doing another task.</div>

<div class="content">As setting up an Autofocus system is pretty straight forward I jumped straight in yesterday After initial euphoria I too was ready to throw in the towel earlier today. The key problems where:<br>- a lack of contexts (e.g. @errands etc)<br>- an absence of project-related foci (I like to  list all my next steps for a project so I can see dependencies etc.)<br>- no easy way to set it up on a Win Mobile device (a. I don't like the idea of setting up individual Onenote pages that resemble A4 sheets as others have suggested - the beauty of Onenote for me is that there is no space limit per page and I can just blob everything on; b. I always carry the mobile, but don't fancy carrying the A4 notepad all the time - the idea of several notebooks is a complete non-starter as I like to have the opportunity to get an overview of everything that needs to be done; c. I like to drop things from Outlook Mail into Outlook Tasks and do not fancy having  to write them out every time)<br>- given the post-Christmas backlog essentially ALL the items on page 1 (of 4) shouted 'do me' and thus a) all I accomplished was to do some easy tasks that did not qualify as 'important ' (yes, I know about the common sense recommendation... - resistance was just too big) and b) I never managed to get unto any other pages.<br><br>...then I came across someone else's post highlighting the 'do one thing (that appeals) then move to the next page routine'. This was quite an eye-opener. So, this afternoon, I tried this approach. Although the majority of tasks were again 'easy', I did manage two tasks that I had been putting off since before Christmas and resistance to some of the other tasks has definitely started to decrease. <br><br>While this still does not address the mobility issue I am pretty happy about the crumbling resistance and increasing momentum. So, will try it again tomorrow...<br></div>

<div class="content">I wonder if a number of the problems mentioned here are as a result of folks coming from the DIT approach where you have the mindset that you *must* complete everything on the list?<br><br>The realization that I had and which Tobias has alluded to is that you move through these pages of tasks pretty quickly...again and again throughout the day - don't try to force yourself to do something that doesn't feel "ready" yet otherwise you dredge up all those feelings of resistance again.<br><br>Effectively, you are sifting and searching for the tasks that feel "ripe for plucking", and leave the rest to incubate.</div>
<h2>Reply by Jason</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-01-6 21:00</div>
<div class="content">But doesn't "ripe for plucking" mean the ones that you feel least resistance to... that's how it feels to me anyway.<br><br>I just feel that the "list" is just an open-ended "to do list" which is what, I thought, we were trying to avoid.<br><br>The earlier pages can only be "closed" when all the tasks are completed, but if you're feelinga huge amount of resistance to even one task on say, page 1, it's never going to be closed... but in the meantime you're just adding more to the end of the list.<br><br>I will continue to try the new system, as I do very much value Mark's thinking, but it's not looking good for me, I have to say.</div>

<div class="content">Jason:<br><br>Your first post here worries me because, like Moises' post, your description does not fit at all what should be happening. The results you are getting would fit someone paging through an open list and doing the things which appeal to them. <br><br>But Autofocus is not an open list approach. It consists of a series of recursions through a repeated sequence of closed lists. This tightens the screws pretty quickly on the tasks you are feeling resistance to.<br><br>Perhaps you could describe exactly what it is you are doing, and I will check that you have got it right.<br><br>And it would be a good idea to read the instructions again!</div>

<div class="content">Jason:<br><br>You write: "but if you're feelinga huge amount of resistance to even one task on say, page 1, it's never going to be closed.."<br>But I thought I understood that when you come on  a page with only one task left, you can do only two things before moving to the next page: <br>A) you can do what has to be done.<br>B) you can decide that the task isn't so important after all, and dismiss it.<br><br>When you feel that the task that is left has to be done, you have no other choice than at least do something about it, just a tiny little action.  Only after having done the first stap (looked up the phone-number you need for that dreaded phonecall, taking out and look at that damned file for 2 minutes), you add the task to the end of the list, cross it of from the previous page, and move on to the next page.  But something has to be done!<br></div>

<div class="content">I am usually an Early Adopter, and I liked the concept of AF when I read the instructions. But I, too, find it easier to manage just "Today" & "Tomorrow" with DIT. Helps me focus on what I can reasonably expect to get done today, and leave every-undifferentiated-thing until tomorrow ('Today' late evening when I prep the list for 'Tomorrow', actually).<br><br>Like DIT, I have been using MS Excel for the AF test. With DIT I only need four tabs - AM (personal activities time), PM (business development time), Evening (business marketing time), and Tomorrow. If I need hard copy, I just hit the Print button. Otherwise I just copy the Excel file to a jump drive and it goes with me wherever.<br><br>Nothing wrong with AF, IMHO, I just prefer DIT.</div>

<div class="content">Jason:<br><br>Your second post (which got posted while I was writing my previous reply to you) worries me to because it doesn't really relate to what should be happening. I don't know what you mean by "if you're feeling a huge amount of resistance to even one task on say, page 1, it's never going to be closed". That doesn't describe anything that's part of the system.</div>

<div class="content">Perhaps a look at how some tasks are phrased might be a good idea. Also a fairly key instruction for me is no. 3 in the Quick Start instructions: "Work on that item for as long as you feel like doing so" - this has enabled me to just do a bit until I feel the desire to move onto something else. Sometimes if I've only done a tiny something on a task it almost feels like cheating to move on to another task on the page or onto another page if that task was the last one to stand out for me. However, the key thing is that I then come back to it again and find that the resistance does indeed decrease once I've made a start.<br><br>I think that rephrasing some tasks so they become less of a project and more of a next action can help. Then again I have some projects where I just list an overall heading such as "work on xyz project" and that's enough to keep me going.<br><br>I do have a second notebook for notes on anything which I don't want to list a load of tasks that either can't be done yet or that aren't really thought through, as well as any other ideas and burblings. I also keep all my notebooks with my supplies incl. my diary in an A4 size (bit bigger) plastic box so everything is in one place. Much of the time though I just walk around taking the reporter's notebook I use for my Autofocus list with me and leaving the box on my desk or wherever I last used it.<br><br>Autofocus does seem to work for me but perhaps it is a personality thing and it might not suit everyone? However, I think sometimes things do take a while to click and in the past I have found some things I really didn't like when I first experienced them I then grew to love...</div>

<div class="content">Jason wrote: "But doesn't "ripe for plucking" mean the ones that you feel least resistance to... that's how it feels to me anyway."<br><br>Well, today I almost finished cleaning the toilet at home. I've been finding reasons to put it off for weeks much to the annoyance of my girlfriend. But it just came round on the AutoFocus list and I just felt in the mood at that moment to knock it off - and it felt pretty effortless. Nothing's changed regarding that situation except my view towards it.<br><br>If  you'd asked me two days (or even two months) ago how much resistance I had to that task, the word "infinite" might have sprung to mind.</div>

<div class="content">Let's say I have a particular task on page 1 that I am feeling an extreme amount of resistance to, it doesn't "appeal" to me at all.<br><br>Surely if that task stays on page 1, then page 1 can never be "closed" - am I not right in saying that?<br><br>Now let's use another example.<br><br>I am working through "page 2", let's say a few tasks I am working on, what about if there are more important things that need to be done today, but they're on page 7, for example... how am I going to get around to those today if I'm still sifting through page 2?<br><br>I have actually read the instructions by the way, several times - and I really want the system to work for me, because to have one place where I can store a list of all my work really does appeal to me.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-01-6 22:21</div>
<div class="content">Jason:<br><br>No, you're not right there. If there's just one task left on page 1 and you come back to page 1 and don't do that task, it is dismissed (by being highlighted) and the page is closed. The dismissed task should not be re-entered (if at all) without your examining whether it should be broken down or re-phrased in some way.<br><br>Re your second question: bear in mind that you only HAVE to take action on one task per page and that task need only be worked on for a short while. That means that you could progress from page 2 to page 7 in a matter of minutes.</div>

<div class="content">Thank you Mark.<br><br>Having spent some time reading the forum maybe one thing I wasn't quite grasping was that you need only do a small part of a task you are feeling a lot of resistance to, even just "getting the file out", but you can then cross the item off the list and enter it at the bottom.<br><br></div>

<div class="meta">2009-01-6 22:31</div>
<div class="content">Absolutely right, Jason. That is one of the keys to the whole system, so you get the "little and often" effect, which is very powerful.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jason<br><br>As I posted above I have found that some tasks which I had been previously resisting under other systems, including DIT, were done effortlessly under Autofocus but I also have items which I am still resisting.  Rephrasing, which I mentioned above helped with some but the fact remains that I have one or two items which I am resisting but which cannot be rephrased and which I know I cannot allow the system to reject.  <br><br>I then had to ask myself why I am resisting them.  The answer revealed that the resistance was not based on the item itself but rather what it represented.  I can categorically state that that resistance would be there regardless of what system I was using.  However - and this is a really big however for me - under DIT all I had done was to beat myself up about my procrastination, and how useless I was at following any kind of system etc etc etc.<br><br>Under DIT or any other system I would have been very unlikely to have questioned my resistance but just accepted it as part of my "normal" procrastination.  The remarkable thing with using AF intuitively is that I did question it - and was amazed by the response.  I still have to do the item, but knowing why I am resisting it has opened up a whole new area for me to look at and will ultimately remove a major stress factor from my life.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine,<br><br>That is really helpful, thank you!<br><br>I think that I am slowly getting there with the system, maybe it's taken a while to "hit home" with me, but I think it's coming together.<br><br>Can you just tell me a bit more about your "rephrasing"... I think that might be one of the problems I am having.<br><br>Most (if not all) of my tasks are big projects, but can't be dismissed at all because they are all client-related, so I have no choice but to do them.  But some are just so daunting and I feel so much resistance to them... is this where your rephrasing comes in?</div>
<h2>Reply by Frank</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-01-6 22:46</div>
<div class="content">That's right Jason. You just do as much of the task as you feel you want to, even if it is just an absurdly small amount of effort. Then you just cross the task off and re-enter it on the final page. That little feeling of completion works wonders in dissolving resistance when you come around to look at the task again next time.</div>

<div class="content">(i'm sorry for my poor English - it's not my native language)<br><br>The important thing is to alway commit yourself to spend at least sometime with every item of your list. The hardest part of getting something done, is actuatlly begin doing it... That's why procrastionation affects us so much!<br><br>With the AF system I'm always in touch with things i have to do and i'm always able to give them a chance. Just like Mr. Foster said:  it's a "little and often" approach.<br><br>When there's something that I really don't wanna do in my list, and it's the last item remaining on the page, I say to myself "Okay, let's give it a chance for 15 minutes". So I set a timer and work on it during that while. If at the end of these 15 minutes, i feel llike keep on doing it, I will. If not, I will just risk the item and rewrite it at the end of my list.<br>Oh yeah, I also split big tasks (such as projects) in several smaller ones, being my first task something like "Start planning project X".<br><br>It's been working fine for me this way =)</div>
