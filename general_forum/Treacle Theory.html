It's highly readable (entertaining even) and makes me wonder how Rands learned Mark Forster's ways of thinking. <br><br>Nominally it's about a programmer's job but don't let that stop you. Really it's good for any job or project. <br><br>Where I found this:  My home AF4 list has the task Read Stuff. Now Stuff is a box of interesting but non-urgent papers I've collected which seemed interesting at the time but I didn't want to stop and read at the time.

Go me!</div>
