<div class="content">In summary: <br>I use a system to help me combat procrastination on some tasks, and the autofocus system seems to actively allow it through dismissing tasks, which leads me to think it may not work well for me.<br><br>To explain:<br>My undesirable behaviour is avoidance and procrastination on the things that I am not motivated to do. There are many of these. eg. business accounts, going shopping, cleaning.<br><br>Currently I use a random selection and timer technique from Mark's "Get Everything Done" which prevents these un-motivating tasks moving towards the end of my long list and never getting done. These two techniques allow me to get past my resistance.<br><br>If I understand the Autofocus system, the tasks that don't motivate me are the tasks that will not, or may never "stand out". Autofocus system says if no items stand out on a first pass all outstanding items are dismissed. What if the consequences of dismissing these, or doing these at a later date is undesirable? eg. Late accounts, hunger/take-outs and a dirty flat!<br><br>Have I misunderstood what "stand out" means? Perhaps I don't fully understand the system yet. Perhaps I need to work on motivation. Any feedback appreciated.</div>

<div class="content">I've got exactly the same problem and I'm looking forward to clarification about this issue.</div>

<div class="content">Taragh:<br><br>I think you are misunderstanding the instructions about dismissing tasks. I will try to make them clearer in subsequent rewrites. In the meantime look at my reply to Jacqui at<br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/622031" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/622031</a></div>

<div class="content">Just to add to your comment Mark about dismissing tasks and clarifying in subsequent rewrites. Your comment to Jacqui clarified this beautifully. I was really unclear about it until then, although reading your original notes it is in there, and couldn't see how I was ever going to get onto page 2 of my task list! Now I think I can see how it will work and it currently feels like a nice system which will need a while to test to see whether tasks I can't face today on my first day back will still be done in time!!<br>I would though, also find it really useful to see an example in a future rewrite with three pages of tasks, say, briefly describing how many tasks you did on each page before moving on etc......that is when you have time to do this!<br>Thanks<br></div>

<div class="content">Naomi:<br><br>Good suggestion. I will probably incorporate something on those lines. <br><br>In the meantime, I am currently working on my last full page. Item: "Comments" (which has been re-entered three times today already!)<br><br>There are 34 items on the page of which I have completed 14. I will probably complete quite a few more before I move on to the next and final page (which may of course not still be the final page when I get to it!)<br></div>

<div class="content">Mark, your recent comments to Seb on "AFTM Deadlines?" <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/622052" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/622052</a> has made this clearer:-<br>The "release" that one feels when an item is ready to be done ("stands out") is not the same as "feeling like doing it". Plus little and often to get through the lists quickly seems important too in order to trust the system. <br>Thank you!</div>

<div class="content">Another grateful Beta tester here.<br><br>I would second Naomi's request for an example of three pages worth of your tasks. <br><br>Unlike Naomi, however, I not only struggled with your original description of 'dismissing tasks' but I also struggled with your clarification to Jacqui. I found myself reading over the same paragraph several times before finally (I think) getting the gist and realising that I was probably trying to make it more complicated than it was. If it helps, I believe my initial confusion was due to being uncertain of the difference between a 'dismissed/highlighted' item by comparison to a crossed off item. <br><br>Unless I've missed it, you don't offer any indication on when one should review a page of dismissed items, or whether that page should be seen as 'active' or not. As a knee-jerk reaction, I find this a little disconcerting (although that's probably a sign that I need to be particularly careful to adhere to your advice and not to re-enter a task without serious consideration). Am I right in thinking I need to be a little bit more adult about this and take on the responsibility to review dismissed pages as regularly as is appropriate to my particular workload and style?</div>

<div class="content">Neumatist:<br><br>Items are crossed off if you do them. They are dismissed (by being highlighted) if you have decided not to do them at all (for the present anyway). All pages on which there are items which have not been crossed off or dismissed are active. Pages on which all items have been either crossed off or dismissed are not active.<br><br>I suggest the easiest way to decide when to review dismissed items is to put an item on your list "Review Dismissed Items"</div>
