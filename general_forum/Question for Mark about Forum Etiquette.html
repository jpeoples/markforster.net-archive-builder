<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>I tried to email you, but it did not seem to go through.  I have a question.  I have finished another short ebook with a new paper based method I am using quite successfully.  I was thinking of selling it for a nominal charge like $5 us.  I do not want to post links if you feel it is inappropriate, as you obviously have your own products.  Please let me know your policy.<br><br>Gerry.</div>

<div class="content">I've no objection to people posting links to their own stuff provided it's directly relevant to the discussion on the list, which I assume yours is.</div>

<div class="content">I have to put it up on my blog, which is stale but has a free version of another system I wrote.  I am also working on another system called Desired Outcomes Implementation Technology or Do It for short which will also be available soon.   Although, it is similar to Wishcraft, just simpler, as I always look for the minimal way to get maximal results.<br><br>Here is the blog with the first free ebook.<br><br><a href="http://simpletimemanagement.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://simpletimemanagement.blogspot.com/</a><br><br></div>
