<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2011-12-16 0:03</div>
<div class="content">Since my last post seems to have been contaminated by a crank (Grinch?), I'm starting another thread on adapting the ideas from<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2006/9/9/plus-or-minus.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2006/9/9/plus-or-minus.html</a><br><br>to AF1.  I've been using this adaptation all day and am really excited about it.  Here's how I'm doing it:<br><br>1. When visiting a page, do the normal slow scan without evaluation. Then do another scan, and make a light pencil minus (–) or plus (+) sign in the left margin on each row, depending on whether you feel resistance or not, respectively.  In my case, I leave some of the entries unmarked, if the context means that it's not practical to do some of the tasks right now.<br><br>2. Take action on at least one of the plus-marked tasks.<br><br>3. Before leaving the page, rewrite each of the minus-marked tasks in a form likely to merit a plus-mark when it comes around next.  In the case that it's hard to think of another way to make the task more palatable, you can still "just do it" (fight the resistance) or decide now that you're never going to do it, and so delete it.<br><br>4. Erase all the pencil marks so that you do the resistance-evaluation fresh when this page comes around again.<br><br>I think this modification will result in me making better progress and seldom needing to dismiss a page.</div>

<div class="content">(off-topic: it was your other post's title that lead people down a different discussion path)<br><br>On-topic:  I think this is an incredibly helpful idea, both how Mark described it, and how you apply it to AF1.  My electronic list isn't good at easy - + over tasks, but I'm thinking to adapt this by highlighting ready stuff, and rewrite/delete negative stuff.</div>

<div class="content">At hOme today, using a pen, so erasing marks doesn't work. I suggest:<br>1. Scan page.  Write a minus by things I could do now but resist.<br>2. Rewrite the minuses to the last page.<br>3. Do some unmarked items.<br><br>Upon reaching the last page, a flow should ensue like Mark describes:<br>Scan, minus, rewrite, scan, minus, rewrite, do, do, do, done.</div>

<div class="content">Puzzle: you mark some tasks as + (no resistance), but only do some of these.  Why not all?</div>

<div class="content">Doing all "+" tasks could take a long time, so I might not leave the current page all day. Just because a task as written offers no resistance (no negative feeling about doing it) doesn't mean it feels "ready to be done." But I agree that it's really only necessary to mark the minuses. In practice, I've been leaving the minus-marked tasks until I'm ready to go to the next page, at which time I rewrite/delete them – gives me some time to think about why there is resistance and what to do about it.</div>
