<div class="content">Hi all, I wanted to share the system I use.  To recap, I posted a couple of months ago to explain I had been using the system detailed at eric.biz for around 6 months with great success.  This involves writing a daily to do list and a weekly to do list and then working the list.<br><br>When writing the daily list I found that some items would carry over (because other things had taken priority), others would be done and new things would appear.  It seemed silly to keep writing what was essentially a rolling list so I ditched the re-writing and simply used a rolling list.  And when writing the weekly list I found that I invariably ended up focusing on the things that needed doing even if they took longer than a week.  So I ditched the weekly list and made it into a focus list.<br><br>This has been working a treat both at work and home.  The dynamics of each location are different and it stands up well.  I thought I'd share the details in full in case anyone wants to try it.  I've seen a few comments here recently which this would address.<br><br>Equipment - a cheap hardback A4 book from any stationers, the kind that doesn't have a spiral so you can write unimpeded.  A cheap ballpoint pen.  A few Post-IT page markers.<br><br>Layout - as follows - when I say "page" I'm usually referring to a single side of each page.<br><br>Month pages - title the first few pages with the next few months, ie, Nov 11, Dec 11, Jan 12, Feb 12, etc.  Use a page marker to mark the current month.  These are used as a tickler for things that you need reminding about later on, eg in Feb 12 you might write "Review villa website for holiday" at the end of the page if you want to do that towards the end of February.<br><br>Waiting for - title this page Waiting for and give it a page marker.  This is used to track that someone or some place needs to get back to you about something.  I always start each item with the date it passed to that entity.  Eg, "31 Oct - Fred to advise on correct measurements"<br><br>Project focus - title this page Project focus, give it a page marker and stop for a moment.  Think about all the things you need or want to get done and which ones mean the most to you, ie they are causing stress but you know you need to tackle them, or perhaps you really want to get started on something good.  Select 3 or 4 such things.  For each one identify the various completion criteria.  Be as detailed as you feel you need to be for each one.  Stressful ones might benefit from much more granularity so you can take bite sized chunks out of it.  You will instincitvely know which projects you need to start with here.<br><br>Write down the project name and the success criteria on this page, for each of the 3 or 4 projects.  You might want to use a couple of sides of paper.  At the end draw a line under them and title the remaining space Holding area.  This is for project ideas that come in before these ones are finished.<br><br>Daily - title this page Daily actions and give it a page marker.  This is for the day to day stuff that needs to get done.  These can be individual actions or things that need a few actions, doesn't matter.<br><br>Notes - this is just you taking notes about anything.  It doesn't need a marker and you can title it whatever you want.  Just go to the next blank page and start writing.  Eg "1 Oct 11 - reviewing lead generation campaign with team".  Make notes pages wherever you want and use them for capturing meeting notes, diagrams, customer calls, project ideas, etc.<br><br>Working the system<br><br>Very simple.  Your goal is to work the project focus list down to nothing.  Get those projects done.  Get the completion criteria done.  No need to write individual actions, just do what you need to do to get the completion criteria done.  If you want to jump between projects a bit to keep it interesting where needed, feel free.<br><br>Also work the daily list, knocking items off here and there while staying focused on the projects overall.<br><br>If you get a new idea for a project come in, make a note in the holding area.  If need be, start a new page for the project and make some notes for later on.<br><br>Periodically review the waiting for lists and the monthly tickler and follow up as needed.<br><br>The whole thing is very free form and open.  The four page markers are the main parts you use.  If you need to record something just turn to the next empty page and record away.<br><br>After a while you will have completed your projects.  Congratulations.  Turn to the next blank page and pick 3 or 4 new projects and repeat.  Use the projects from the holding area as ideas for this batch - maybe you can run with a couple, scrap a couple and put one in the monthly tickler for a couple of months away because you feel it will be more relevant then.  Also use the tickler for ideas - perhaps a project is now ready for action having been tickled a few weeks ago for around now.<br><br>I also found it helpful to number the page corners as I went along, and every couple of weeks update an index in the back of the book listing key words or ideas for what's on that page.  This allows me to find stuff very easily. It also means if I add a project into the project focus and I've made some notes previously on it, I can put the page number in brackets so I can reference those notes as I work the completion criteria.<br><br>This system has a number of advantages<br><br>1) absolutely everything is in one place - tickler, projects, notes, waiting for tracking, actions<br>2) it keeps focus tightly on 3-4 key projects at a time until they are done, no need to feel distracted<br>3) it allows other ideas to take root without losing focus or being forced to put them to one side<br>4) it provides flexibility and is not rules bound<br>5) it's cheap - a book and a pen and some page markers<br><br>I use a separate book for home and for work.  The dynamics of each are different for me.  At work I have tons of notes pages and a nice churn through project focus with a few daily actions each day.  At home I have slower project focus and fewer notes and more daily actions.<br><br>Thanks for taking the time to read through it, I hope it's useful.  It's been working well for me for around 6 months.  Any questions please ask.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Chris, I'm going to try your system, but I'm going to make a few changes to it. Do you have a space for your calendar?  I'm going to try using two full pages per month- left side numbered 1 - 31, right side for a tickler for that month.  I have been using a free-form notebook which also includes a hand drawn weekly calendar, but it's a much smaller size. (the medium sized moleskin). <br><br>Instead of limiting my current projects to 3 or 4, I'm going to use however many I'm currently working on. I'm afraid an important project might fall through the cracks.   I'm going to use a "someday/maybe" list for projects that are on hold. I think I'll list the projects a la David Allen's natural project planning - purpose, vision, organization, next actions (they can go on my AF list). <br><br>For daily pages, I'm going to use a running AF1 list, continuing a full page on the next available page, keeping with the free-form idea. I also have separate waiting for list that I will continue to use. <br><br>Your "notes page" looks good, I used to use a Daily record of events page, but it amounts to the same thing. I draw a line down the margin and a line under each item creating a checkbox.  If it's actionable I make sure it gets on the right list and then check it off.      <br><br>As I mentioned, I have been using a free-form system as well, but your system seems to have a little bit more structure and an interesting project focus.  I find my free-form book is a bit uncomfortably scattered.  I'll let you know how it works.</div>

<div class="content">How can you limit yourself to 3 or 4 projects?   I must have 30 or 40 going at any given time or I just get bored.  :-)</div>

<div class="content">Couldn't you make it even simpler by combining the project list with the daily actions list? That way you could avoid having to jump from list to list.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Paul,<br><br>Calendar - I use an electronic calendar (Sunbird Portable) and Outlook at work.  Adding a calendar to the book is a great idea if it delivers a way to remind you of stuff and lets you record stuff.  In that case I'd be inclined to do away with the month section and use the month calendar for tickler type items (same difference really).  For me the month section is all I need to track something that needs to be looked at weeks later.<br><br>Projects - the power of this system is the project focus on a small number of projects with a view to getting them completed.  The focus is on finishing.  I fear adding more will mean you work on more but don't get them finished because you lose the focus.  Plus I find completion criteria tend to drift for projects that are dragging on.  If you think you can really get moving on lots of projects, define completion criteria and get them finished, by all means try it and I'd be interested to know how it works for you.  Don't worry about any slipping through the cracks with just 3-4 though.  The holding section takes care of that and if you've got a buzz of ideas about another project by all means start a project notes page for it to return to when you eventually get it on your focus list.<br><br>Daily AF list - the daily list can feel similar to AF but bear in mind you're not dropping all ideas into this list.  It's for the other stuff that needs to get done *despite* working on the current project focus.  You want the daily list to remain relatively short and not get out of hand.  I use it as a mental break from the project focus, ie I spend maybe 30 mins getting a few of them done then return to project focus.  I tend to add fewer than 10 items a day to this list at work.<br><br>I used to have a Someday/Maybe back in GTD days but I ditched it.  It became a cluttered mess of the very things I was seeking to clear up, a sprawling mirror of the random ideas that everybody gets.  It was quite a relief letting go of them and trusting that as life moves on relevant, realistic ideas will resurface.<br><br>The notes pages are one of the real strengths of this for me, especially at work.  Customer meetings, events, product updates, it's all there.  I also plan projects in notes pages and refer to them when the project gets focus.<br><br>The main thing is having something that removes stress, gets stuff done and that you stick with.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>The project list doesn't contain tasks or actions, but completion criteria.  These are the things you consider must be done to class the project as done.  Each criteria may have a number of actions which you just get on with.  You're not really working a list here.  The daily list is for stuff which comes up despite the focus on the projects.  It's a place to note things so you don't forget while you're getting on with the projects.  Now and again you get a few of the things on there done.  You're not jumping around at all in normal use.  Much of the time you may not even be in the book.</div>

<div class="content"><<The project list doesn't contain tasks or actions…>><br><br>Some very good points, Chris.  Enjoyed your posts.<br><br>Mark, with utmost respect, I do not see how project list(s) can be mixed with tasks or actions.  The project list could be extensive, and have various levels of importance.  It seems valuable to have a concise summary of projects; knowing instantly which ones are current, medium-term, long-term, on-hold, etc. with short notes as key reminders and "criteria" as Chris puts it.  <br><br>As usual, I am always paying a lot of attention to Alan’s (and Jupiter’s) posts.<br>The following is a long quote from Alan in <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1634312" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1634312</a> , but I would like to include it here because it is so right-on-the-money for me, and touches on previous threads that appear contradictory to me (an open issue):<br><br>“My idea is to aggressively push stuff from AF into projects. It should be easy to reduce autofocus to 60 tasks or less, including projects. All tasks are either Do soon, Do later, Do on schedule, Do at a certain place/time, or Don't. Only the first need stay in AF. The second and fourth can fit into project planning. Here's the scheme (not rules):<br><br>If something is not ready to do, I consider under what circumstance I will be ready. Usually, the thing will be put into a project, and the project itself added to my list. Next, in processing the project, I consider goals, plans, etc., and select an action or two for AF. Later after working an item, I reconsider the project, and what to do next. <br><br>The effect I hope for is <br>1) very fast AF<br>2) clear view of all important projects<br>3) ability to decide what projects to focus on<br>4) no sense of stuff hiding in corners forgotten<br>(#5) systemizing efficiency within groups of similar tasks.”<br><br>I agree with all these points (emphatically).  <br><br>Isn't the active list dynamic and prone to get marked-up and outdated very quickly?  Many times I have just forgotten about projects that were started/stranded, but needed finishing or follow-up.  Some of these are so numerous I would be very reluctant to mix these in with things that would appear on a daily actions list.  And if I did want to re-write or update my project list, it seems I would want it all in one place to see the “big picture”.</div>

<div class="content">BKK:<br><br><< Mark, with utmost respect, I do not see how project list(s) can be mixed with tasks or actions. >><br><br>I was, I admit it, being slightly sarcastic. The reason is that I find it difficult to believe that anyone has enough active projects to need the suggested degree of organization. My experience with projects (and I've run plenty of very complicated ones) is that if you are actively working on a project, it is basically alive in your mind and you can sum up the action required on it almost at will. <br><br>That's not to say that you may not need project documentation or reminders. I use all those constantly. But what I don't use is a list of outstanding current tasks for a project. The right place for those is in your AF/SF list. <br><br>There's a very simple reason for this. If you group all the project tasks together, your mind looks at the project as a whole. To use the old saying "A journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step", your mind sees the 1,000 mile journey instead of the step.<br><br>If your mind sees the steps individually then there is much less resistance involved.<br><br>Of course it is important that some of the steps are "Project Management" type tasks, such as:<br><br>Review Project X<br>Discuss Project X with Y<br>Think about Project X<br>etc. etc.</div>

<div class="content">There appears to be some failure in communication here. BKK quotes me, but I fully agree with Mark. In particular, I agree with this:<br>"But what I don't use is a list of outstanding current tasks for a project. The right place for those is in your AF/SF list."<br>I have outstanding not-yet-current tasks listed with a project, but when one of these becomes current, it moves to the AF list. <br><br>I should also emphasize to BKK: what you quote there is largely untested. It might not work.  Also note that I stretch the definition of project well beyond Mark's use of the term.</div>

<div class="content">I usually have more than 30 projects going at once (defining a project as anywhere from a handful of related tasks that probably have sequential dependencies, all the way up to months-long endeavors involving many team members).   I can't focus on just 3-4 at a time "until they are completed", because many of them last for weeks or more, and have external dependencies such as schedules, other team deliverables, etc.<br><br>I may focus most of my attention on 1 or 2 projects for a few days, but still need to make sure things are staying current with the others.   As a result, I can't keep all the details fresh in my mind for all my active projects.<br><br>Interspersing project pages with "misc" pages in my notebook works great for this, and cycling through all of them in the spirit of the AF rules.</div>

<div class="content">Sorry to bring this topic up from the grave, but thought I'd throw out an idea I've been using lately for projects.  I use AF1 mostly, with a few minor tweeks to fit my work style.  I was using a pocket size notebook when I first learned of this system, but have recently switched to a larger notebook (5.5" x 8.5").<br><br>Anyway, for projects, and other items that I want grouped together, I purchased some large post-it notes (4" x 6", lined).  I use one for each project. I place these on the most recent dismissed pages, so they do not cover any open items, and process them as any other AF page.  When I dismiss another regular AF page, I move the "farthest back" post-it note forward, so they are as near to the active pages as they can be.  I also use this for a shopping list, then when I go to the store, I just pull the post-it note out and take it with me.</div>

<div class="content">I like the Holding Area for projects. I sometimes try to work on too many at once. We always have the option to say we've done enough on one project for now and move it to holding, and move one from holding up.<br><br>Not all projects have completion criteria. I take voice lessons because I enjoy them, not because I want to reach a certain level. It's still a good question to ask, though, when we examine a project.<br><br>I use different methods for recording project-related tasks, depending on the project and the day. If I need to focus on a short-term goal for the project, it goes on my active list to keep it fresh in my mind. The individual tasks also go in my active list if there aren't very many.<br><br>If the project is big enough to need a page of its own to plan, I'm happy leaving the details on the project page. I write the project name in my active list.<br><br>It's the same with many recurring events. "3 weekly tasks" and "room of the month" go on my active list. It's faster to write that than to look up the tasks or room when I'm planning. Once it's time to work on one of the tasks, I look it up (or not -- sometimes the room of the month gets chosen for reasons other than its spot in the rotation).</div>
