<div class="content">See Mark's latest blog entry. <br><br><<If you’ve got some tasks which are “sticking”, have a look at what you’re saying to yourself when you pass by them. “I’ll do it later because…”<br><br>Then tackle the “because”!">><br><br>Well isn't this the (dynamic) rub? What if the "because" is: "because I never really enjoyed doing this task/project but now I'm stuck doing it because...". David Byrne captured the spirit of this idea with these phrases:<br><br>    And you may ask yourself<br>    Where is that large automobile?<br>    And you may tell yourself<br>    This is not my beautiful house!<br>    And you may tell yourself<br>    This is not my beautiful wife! <br><br>Then the real work begins. Perhaps the first item should be: Shred the list.</div>

<div class="content">Yeah, what Mark said.  I was wondering that as well.  The baby and bathwater thing comes to mind ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Good call Mike. It should have read: Shred much of the list.</div>

<div class="content">You've got one of these new-fangled selective shredders, have you?</div>

<div class="content"><< You've got one of these new-fangled selective shredders, have you? >><br><br>Yes, but you invented it. I believe it's called Dismissal :)</div>

<div class="content">ROTFLMAO ;-)  Now THAT I agree with.  Much clarity comes from ripping out what is causing the problem.</div>

<div class="content">Oh this thread made me laugh so much. Why? Only because I have been completely rubbish at dismissal and so have reached exactly the same point as Avrum with a bunch of sticking tasks and starting to feel rather Groundhog when I go through my list. I too was passing them going "I'll do that later" and, guess what, no action occurs and they're still there weeks later...As soon as I read the posts I had one of those little light bulb moments.<br><br>So, today I am going through the list and examining all those hangers-on hiding in there and either dismiss, do something (anything) be that take a small step or rephrase if it is still important. I'll report back on the outcome later.<br><br>Thanks as always guys for such a stimulating forum.</div>
