<div class="content">I'm reading The Brain that Changes Itself, by Normal Doidge.<br><br>Summary: The brain changes in response to stimulus (and lack thereof), even as adults. The parts in charge of frequently-used functions grow, at the expense of less-used functions. As you get even better at a skill, the neurons get more efficient, and fewer are devoted to the task. The total mass of the brain can also increase. If an area is damaged, other areas can be recruited to do the same job, often very well. In 1970, anyone suggesting this happens past childhood wouldn't be published. They stopped post-stroke therapy because any more was thought to be useless. Kids who had difficulties were shunted off to "don't bother teaching". Kids with problems in some areas were (and still are) taught to compensate with different skills (datebook rather than memory), and they don't bother working on the weak skills.<br><br>Now, neuroplasticity in adults is accepted -- at least among those who learned with current text books. Adults' brains aren't as plastic as kids' brains, but it's still plastic enough to be worth the effort.<br><br>The book is well-written, lots of engaging case studies and interesting researchers.<br><br>And how does that apply here?<br><br>The book describes a computer program to help kids with language problems rewire their brains. Cute characters, tasks start easy then get faster, reward. Same-old, same-old. We all know kids won't stick with it if there's no reward.<br><br>And then, "This 'reward' is a crucial feature of the program, because each time the child is rewarded, his brain secretes such neurotransmitters as dopamine and acetylcholine, which help consolidate the map changes he has just made. (Dopamine reinforces the reward, and aceylcholine helps the brain 'tune in' and sharpen memories.)"<br><br>My interpretation: We need to reward ourselves for anything we want to do more of. After working on an unliked task or finishing a routine, have a small sweet. After going to the list rather than the internet, pick something you look forward to. (In moderation.) After finishing an AF1 page or an FV chain, do something fun.<br><br>We also need to reward ourselves for learning even little bits. Lock it in so we don't have to learn it again. That's not the same as rewarding ourselves for spending an hour not focusing.<br><br>Conversely, we need to not reward ourselves for things we don't want to reinforce. Don't reward myself for having a treat by having a second one. (E.g., Take morning off, then go out for lunch.) Don't take the morning off after going to bed late. Don't have a can of pop to get energy after not bothering to have a proper lunch.</div>
