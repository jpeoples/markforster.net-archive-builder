<div class="content">Firstly, some background about me.<br>1. I've been using GTD for about three years and have tried various methods of recording next actions (currently I'm using Thinking Rock).<br><br>2. I haven't yet tried Autofocus, but I read many of the posts in the Forum.<br><br>Autofocus is a very interesting system. The concept is simple and I understand why many people here support it strongly. In my opinion, the most important thing to bear in mind is to keep a separate system for tasks that are time-sensitive. Autofocus, like GTD, is about using one's discretionary time, not time which is already committed.<br><br>If I were to start using Autofocus, I would probably use a spreadsheet and enter data in the following columns:<br><br>A  Entry serial number<br>B  Date of entry<br>C  Action (task) detail<br>D  Context<br>E  Follow up date<br>F  Deadline/action date/scheduled date<br>G  "X" - to mark the "stopped here" spot.<br>H  Date action (task) was done<br><br>Comments about the above list:<br><br>Having a record of Context solves the problem about, for example, knowing what matters/tasks/actions form the agenda for discussion with my boss (context @Agenda - Boss, for anybody familiar with the GTD methodology).<br><br>The Follow up date and the Deadline/action date/scheduled date, would help use the spreadsheet as a diary for any time-sensitive tasks. Thus one would avoid having to keep two systems (Autofocus and a diary).<br><br>In practice I would use the spreadsheet filter and/or sort functions on an ad hoc basis to determine common contexts or date-specific tasks. The entry serial number would help me to sort the entries back to the original order.<br><br>Having said that, I should also say that using a spreadsheet may not be very productive, because a spreadsheet is not as portable as a notebook or even a few loose sheets of paper. As I wrote earlier, I haven't actually tried Autofocus, hence my comments are not validated and indeed could be flawed.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Dean<br><br>I can see where you are coming from but AF is not GTD and I think that you may run into problems if you try to combine too much.  I have experimented with additional tags etc and to be honest found that anything added to the system as written adds distraction.  My recommendation would be to try the system exactly as written so that you can experience the benefits for yourself. <br><br>I use a standard A4 notebook, pretty similar to that seen in Mark's video.  As you have identified, AF is for discretionery time, and therefore an external schedule is also required, as is a system for management of certain outside factors such as projects and your context lists.<br><br>What I personally do to manage all of that is to use Microsoft OneNote.  That includes my schedule, all project management and I have all of my pages set up in OneNote as well as my notepad. It takes only a minute or so to add a page of items into OneNote and those items can be sent to Outlook if necessary or tagged according to context.  It is then very easy to print a summary of all tagged items (by context) for reference in a meeting. <br><br>Give it a try, using just a simple format, and see how you get on .........</div>

<div class="content">Thank you for your comments. I'll follow up on the idea of using OneNote (and Outlook).<br><br>My biggest problem may be the transition from practicing GTD to testing Autofocus. There is a natural doubt of success and fear of the uncertain that I would have to overcome.</div>

<div class="content">That's a great idea to use a simple spreadsheet.<br><br>You can alternate the background every 25 lines or so to signify a page.  Then resize the window to show 25 lines at a time.<br><br>Use Google Spreadsheets for portability.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Dean<br><br>It is totally natural to have that fear factor but even that is something that I think you will find AF has an impact upon.  I know it sounds as if many of us go a bit overboard in singing it's praises, but that's because it has such a profound impact that it's simplicity disguises.<br><br>I've been using AF since day 1 of Beta testing and am still hooked - that has NEVER happened for me with any other system - there have always been some degrees of procrastination - and I have never been able to use a system for this length of time without going away from it periodically.<br><br>Do let us know how you get on ......<br><br></div>

<div class="content">I just started this system and must say that the initial getting everything into the notebook is time consuming, but great to just get it out of my head.  I also like that it isn't overly complicated and I don't have to prioritize and analyze everything, just do it.  <br><br>I've started three notebooks (wedding, home/house and work).  I did have everything for the wedding in all kinds of different lists, etc. but find that using this system of just getting it all on paper without using categories, priorities, etc. looks to be much easier than the other systems I've tried.  Obviously there are things that must be complete by certain dates, but those things I can put in my Google Calendar with a reminder when I need to work on it.<br><br>Like I said, I've just started, but I'm excited to see where it goes.</div>

<div class="content">Deb:<br><br>Actually my recommended method of starting is just to write down a few items at first and then add others as you think of them or as they come up. That way you have a list which reflects your live concerns.</div>
