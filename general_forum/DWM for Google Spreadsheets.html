<div class="content">I've been learning some Google Apps Scripting, and found it more powerful than I thought.<br><br>I'm building a spreadsheet that's similar to DWM.xls, but obviously with some differences.<br>It's slower, but usable.<br>It doesn't support keyboard shortcuts to run scripts, but I've found a workaround that I like.<br><br>I hesitate if to build it for DWM or DWM2. The latter works fine for my DWM/DIT combination, but it could be adapted to DWM1, somehow.<br><br>This is how it's looking by now:<br><a href="http://i153.photobucket.com/albums/s238/walrez/DWM-DIT.jpg" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://i153.photobucket.com/albums/s238/walrez/DWM-DIT.jpg</a><br><br>Walter</div>

<div class="content">Looks good Walter.<br>Might even be good enough for editing DWM-DIT spreadsheet using mobile browsers. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">DWM is a must.<br><br>DWM2 - perhaps, rather as an option, I don't quite understand its rules - too many, too complex.<br><br>I specially stick to AF2 - imho it's the most productive option in my case as number 2. DWM rulez!!!<br><br>So, AF2, and perhaps AF1 and AF4 would be a luxury.<br><br>Just in case you have too much time. :-)<br><br>Regards, and thanks for your work.</div>
