<div class="content">Hello all ! <br>Last month I tried to explain how I used a paper base autofocus base and evernote for The following of my project. Well i had to adapt it again for I Launoy spent all my pats month outside my office and i fond very difficult to follow and adapt my system on The Road.<br>let's summerize what i realised i needed.<br>1. Use a Gtd approach - ie project list, deadlines, some contexts such as @Call, @mac, @Wait, @Someday MAYBE, @work, @home, @info, @ticker<br>But also Time réserved  to Work  on my project<br>2. Keep The advantage of af ie a long actionnable list of tasks mostly relative to a project with appliance of af dissmiss rules <br>3. Keep only but one system where all CAN be centralised because if i don t all thibgs Will Become much complicated.<br>4. Take altitude about things to identify my bigs rocks and do at The Right Time what is only but necessary<br>5. Take The best of what i learned The past 4 years about Gtd and autofocus Because there are some indeed interesting principle on both system.<br>6. Find a software wich CAN either Work on mac and on my iPhone and be synchronized.<br>7. Be able to Take notes relative to m'y projects and tasks even if they are short.<br>So i went back to Omnifocus.<br>I added a New context Call @Hotlist wich contains The mots active and important tasks i have to do and if it is a baclog it simply goes to my others context.<br>For The rest i simply follow mf rules for af on my Hotlist context and Gtd rules For reviews and project s Work.<br>The implémentation from evernote to Omnifocus was short about an hour for over 180 tasks.<br>I gona report later how it works.</div>

<div class="content">Let me guess what you're doing.  You have an AF4 list divided into open and closed parts, and each task is also assigned a GTD context.  Then you filter your list to the appropriate context, and work that sublist according to AF4 rules.  Plus you started a hotlist context to filter down to a select few tasks when needed.<br><br>P.S. "I Launoy spent all my pats month..."?</div>

<div class="content">Nb read i had to adapt the system for i spent my time ouside of my office.. And i may add it was difficult to update with evernote<br>------<br>Hi alan<br>I think you got most of it.<br>Except each task is assigned to a project ( more often) and a context when it is dissmiss, not important, non urgent or specialised ie @call or @mac<br>Hot list is reserved for hot and important actionable tasks watever mzy be the context.<br>Then clearly i focus on what is urgent and what is important with the hotlist context.<br>I can read the all list just clicking on context, i can focus on my most urgent/important tasks just clicking on hot list, i can see all my call just clicking on call, or see what i am wairing for just clicking on wait context and if i have to work on the all project i just focus on the project and work on it..,</div>
