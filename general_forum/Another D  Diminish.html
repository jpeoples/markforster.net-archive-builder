<div class="content">We often talk about the 4 D's: Do, Delete (or Dismiss), Defer, Delegate. (Vague memory that another was suggested.)<br><br>Judith Morgenstern has another. Diminish. According to the article which quoted her, she means dividing it into smaller steps. I'd call that Divide.<br><br>To me, Diminish means reduce the scope. Be less of a perfectionist. Do just enough. By definition, just enough is still enough.<br><br>So now we're up to 6 or more.</div>

<div class="content">And if your preferred option is Delegate, then make sure you read the chapter on Delegating in "Secrets of Productive People" first!</div>

<div class="content">+1 for Divide, Divvy.<br><br>-1 for Diminish, despise, disparage, demote, downsize.  Belittling tasks doesn't seem the right frame of mind.</div>

<div class="content">Just enough (or good enough) doesn't have to mean half-hearted or barely. It means do enough to reach your goal, but no more. Or even ask if you've accurately described your goal in the first place.<br><br>If your goal is a relaxed Christmas with your family, make only 2 pies, not 5, or even, gasp, buy them. If your goal is to have a comfortable home, vacuum weekly, not daily (unless you live near the beach). If your goal is to earn a degree while raising a family, aim for B's rather than A's, and spend the time you save with your kids.<br>None of those are routine, and you would probably have your heart in each of them.<br><br>Living well enough that I can look back and say it my life was well-lived is a very high standard.</div>

<div class="content">More thoughts. Diminish is only one option, just like the other Ds. It's on the list to be considered, not something that you should automatically do.<br><br>Looking at Christmas dinner, the family travel plans, their  schedules, and their cooking skills, I cannot dismiss it, delegate, or defer. I can, however, reduce the number of pies that I bake.<br><br>I like Divide.</div>

<div class="content">(My horrified voice) But... but... but... is a two-pie Christmas rather than a five-pie Christmas really Christmas at all?</div>
