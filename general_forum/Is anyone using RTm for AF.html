<div class="content">I used Remember the Milk for my GTD lists and liked a lot of the features. Is anyone using it for Autofocus (AF2/RAF)? Is it even possible since (as far as I can tell) you can't sort by task entry date?</div>

<div class="content">I tried using it on my iPhone (I had RTM Pro) and couldn't get it to work because of not being able to sort by task creation date.</div>

<div class="content">Yep, the lack of Task Creation Date is a showstopper for that software.</div>

<div class="content">I looked at the feature request forum and people have been requesting that every month or so for the past year. That is too bad, RTM is literally faster than paper for me.</div>

<div class="content">Try Toodledo. You can sort by start date, due date, date added, date last modified and more. I sort by date modified.</div>

<div class="content">I am testing FocusPad for the iPhone and so far absolutely love it. Much better for AF than Toodledo, though I really liked Toodledo at one point.</div>

<div class="content">I use RTM. Each task starts with a line number. 001, 002, 003, etc. Then sort the tasks by "task name."</div>

<div class="content">Duane:<br>That is a great idea! I wonder if there is a way to automate that process - so that if you are in your inbox, you dont have to switch to a list to see your current number.<br><br>What do you do about not being able to see competed items on the same page?</div>

<div class="content">JTKaspar:<br>I don't need to see completed items, but I do need to see unactioned items on pages for the Forward Mode. I use imaginary pages - 20 line numbers (completed or not) per page. I just wish that RTM would allow the printing of selected items instead of printing the whole list.</div>

<div class="content">I'm using RTM but have reverted back to Do It Tomorrow which it works perfectly with.<br><br>Have decided that I prefer the closed list approach.  Anything that doesn't get done stays on the list as active.  The repeat options (i.e. every 1 day and after 1 day) make life a lot easier too.</div>

<div class="content">Duane:<br>How do you know which tasks are "up for review" if you don't know where the completed tasks were? Do you use the line numbers, or do you put a fixed number of tasks up for review at the beginning of each day?</div>

<div class="content">JTKaspar:<br>I use line numbers to identify the tasks to be put on notice for review. If my first contiguous block of line numbers ends, say, with line 123, I create a new dummy task with line number 123rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr. This line will be sorted between 123 and 124, and serves as my separator line.</div>

<div class="content">Duane:<br>This is looking very doable. How do you decide which items to put up for review if the completed tasks are gone?</div>
