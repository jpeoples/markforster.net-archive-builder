<div class="content">+AJPM+<br><br>As promised two days ago in another thread,<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1244400" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1244400</a><br><br>here is my tweak for AF4.<br><br>----<br><br>INTRODUCTION: A little background story<br><br>(You can skip to THE TWEAK ITSELF section which is the next post below)<br><br>I think my situation is familiar to many AF users: AF lists chock-full of repetitious tasks than we have to do again and again on different days, or maintenance tasks as Erik would call them...especially house chores.  They fill up our AF lists with stuff that will never be written off but will forever be crossed out then re-written in the end of the list, yet most of<br>them we cannot even do now, and yet vie attention with our other tasks.  And the problem is that (at least with my observations in its use) AF4 rapidly breaks down in effectiveness when you go past 200 or so tasks.  Of course we can switch to AF1 which, to my amazement when I was using it before, does not break down when you put lots more tasks into it,  but (for me) it does not handle urgent items very well.  Then there is AndreasE's "Ping Pong" AF1 tweak which tries to remedy that, <br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/988459" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/988459</a><br><br>but, for some reason it didn't help.  After using AF4 and then Ping Pong AF1 for a couple of weeks I switched back to AF1, even though I just do not like how it does not handle urgent matters, because of the latter's effectiveness in handling large volumes of tasks.<br><br>The breakthrough came when I watched Erik Lorraine's videos.  I was intrigued by his Kanban time management scheme (TMS) and tried to emulate it, but since using those pesky Post-It tags would mean I have to discontinue using my fountain pen (BOOOO!) <br>and also since I found that filling up "energy/time blocks" is not as important for me (sorry if I mangled up your terminology, Erik; and also, please correct me if I misrepresent your thoughts/ideas later on) I just sticked to my own AF list.<br><br>Now, something Erik said in his third video really puzzled me.  He already mentioned in his second video his observation/opinion that putting all of one's task reminders ("triggers") in a list could effectively cripple that person.  <br><br>And yet in the third video he then says that he does not see his Kanban system as a list, although he cannot understand why, and I think it was in his fourth video that he says he puts all of his task reminders in his Kanban system because, well, it is not a list.<br><br>And yet for all appearances, Erik's Kanban system LOOKS like a list.  It may have movable items, but it still is a collection of written items...hence a list.  Now I was intrigued, maybe there was something I did not understand or pick up in Erik's first video, which explained his system in detail.  So I watched it again a few times, and then, it clicked.<br><br>Most TMSs like AF and GTD use to-do checklists.  Erik's Kanban system, on the other hand, is a collection of <<systems checklists>>.<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdGaRUklIig" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdGaRUklIig</a><br><br>The main difference between a systems checklist and a to-do checklist is that the systems checklist has a predefined goal---maintain the system---while the to-do checklist has none.  Therefore each item in a systems checklist is predefined and can be used again and again.  A systems checklist lists components of a system to be checked to make sure that a system is working properly.  For example, in the video above, a preflight checklist is done to be sure that the airplane is working properly before flight.  <br><br>In Erik's Kanban scheme, he treats the maintenance part of his time management  as system checklists, and these systems include Himself, His House, His Family, His Work.  The Kanban scheme highlights those items in each system that need to be addressed so that the system will function properly.<br><br>Now I realized that handling maintenance tasks like this would be very effective in reducing the active items in an AF list because these repetitive tasks would be considered by the AF system only when they SHOULD be considered, not before.  I then began thinking of a way of doing this efficiently, because I quickly realized a method in which I have to write each maintenance task from a list into my AF list would consume too much time.<br><br>How effective was the resulting tweak?  My AF1 list immediately shrunk from around six or seven pages to just TWO, and therefore I shifted to AF4 which I felt was more effective in this situation, and I never looked back since.</div>

<div class="content">+AJPM+<br><br>THE TWEAK ITSELF<br><br>A. How I did it: Setup<br><br>1) My AF list is in a Rollabind notebook, so my Maintenance Checklists are in a separate section of my notebook.  However, I think it is also quite feasible for users of fixed page notebooks to have their checklists at the BACK.<br><br>2) In my AF list, I marked each repetitive task to help me consider them better, then I considered the different systems that they may be in.  I eventually got these categories:<br><br>Morning House Upkeep<br>Midmorning House Upkeep<br>Afternoon House Upkeep<br>Evening House Upkeep<br>Daily Unscheduled House Upkeep<br>Weekly/Occassional House Upkeep<br>Room Upkeep<br>Computer Upkeep<br>Mental/Social/Emotional Self Upkeep<br>Physical Self Upkeep<br>Professional Upkeep<br>Car Upkeep<br>Time Management Upkeep<br>Miscellaneous Upkeep<br><br>3) I wrote each category of tasks in a separate page in my Checklists section, and I also indicate the page number in the top right.  The page numbers are important, as you will see.<br><br>4) I then crossed out the repetitive tasks from my AF list.  And boy, they were A LOT!<br><br>5) Finally, I entered each category into my AF list, enclosing them in <> to distinguish them from other entries, and beside them the page number.  Thus:<br><br><1: Morning> <br><2: Midmorning> <br><3: Afternoon> <br><4: Evening><br><5: Daily> <br><6: Weekly/Occ'l><br><7: Room><br><8: Computer><br><9: MSE Self><br><10: Px Self><br><11: Prof'l><br><12: Car><br><13: TMS><br><14: Misc><br><br>B.  How I did it: In Practice<br><br>1) For reference, let us look first at a scan of one of my checklists:<br><br><a href="http://i994.photobucket.com/albums/af63/nuntym/test/ScanImage002.jpg" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://i994.photobucket.com/albums/af63/nuntym/test/ScanImage002.jpg</a><br><br>and here are the meanings of each symbol beside each item:<br><br><a href="http://i994.photobucket.com/albums/af63/nuntym/test/ScanImage001.jpg" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://i994.photobucket.com/albums/af63/nuntym/test/ScanImage001.jpg</a><br><br>(I apologize for my atrocious handwriting :blush:)<br><br>2) I have to prime each category before use.  That is, I have to mark out with a ∙ each task that has to be done.  I can do this in two ways.  One is to set aside a time to mark through each category.  Another, and one that I find I am doing more often, is to do the marking when you are processing a checklist, as detailed below.<br><br>3) I then process my AF4 list per the original rules.  <br><br>4) Once the AF4 points out that I need to do a Maintenance Checklist, I look at the page number and go to that checklist.  I then process it as I would a page in AF1, with the first pass an overview, the second pass to mark (∙) those that I need to do, mark with checks (√) what I have already done, and mark with crosses (×) what I had failed to do before but cannot do now, and the third pass picking out what I should do now from all the items by marking it with the first part of a check/cross (\).<br><br>5) Once I finished a task, I complete the check symbok (√) beside the item, and (if needed) write the date I need to do it again, then I remained in that checklist to see, using the AF1 rules, if I need to do something else from those marked with a ∙.<br><br>6) If I run out of space to mark a task, I just cross it out and rewrite it on the bottom.<br><br>7) Once I am satisfied that I finished all I want to do in that checklist, I go back to my AF list, cross out that Maintenance Checklist item, and rewrite it at the end.<br><br>And that's it! I hope this will help somebody.<br><br>God bless us all.</div>

<div class="content">This is awesome nuntym!  I've been moving in this direction myself but I haven't gotten as far as you have. I really like the connection you make to airplane system checklists. That really illuminates. <br><br>In my case I currently have 4 checklists which I operate as one-offs:  <br>Morning, starting work, finishing work, and bedtime. Besides this I'm building lists for other tasks and projects but I don't operate them like checklists. Details are changing as I write, so I'll save that for another day. And I'll start looking out for more system checklists I can make like yours.</div>

<div class="content">I like this. It groups tasks that are logically done (or at least considered) together, and keeps them that way even if some things aren't done each time through.<br><br>Questions:<br><br>It looks like you mark-up the system list. Do you rewrite it each time? Rewriting the mid-morning list each day could get tedious. Also, when you rewrite it, do you note which items you've skipped? (So they don't get skipped several times in a row.)</div>

<div class="content">+AJPM+<br><br>Alan,<br><br>Well, I do not treat projects as checklists, because I do not think that's feasible.  I organize into checklists only those items that are repetitive maintenance tasks.  Projects are more of to-do lists, so I treat them as such using more or less the method you detailed in another thread.<br><br>I'm glad this helped you Alan.  Good luck with your hunting for systems ^__^<br><br>God bless.</div>

I use therefore those symbols, the dot (∙), the half-way symbol (\), the check (√), and the cross (×) to mark those tasks that are pending, being worked on currently, done, and not done, respectively.<br><br>I only rewrite when there is no more space to write those symbols to the right of each item.<br><br>Sorry if the instructions were not clear.<br><br>God bless.</div>

<div class="content">Hello All,<br><br>I like the concept of checklists which I know has been debated on this forum before.  Like some of you, I too am putting these maintenance/repetitive tasks on a separate list.  There are some useful hints already in this thread about how one can do this.<br><br>I thought of using a worksheet like Cricket, but got into the same situation as Cricket, ie 'but I found I always skipped the same tasks, even when I saw a long row of unchecked boxes'!<br><br>It was this forum where I first saw mention of The Checklist Manifesto book which I read (I've just bought the author's two earlier books and can detect the beginning of the Checklist Manifesto in his first book).<br><br>Not only am I drawn towards the checklist as a tool for managing maintenance tasks, but also for important ones, a a la pre-fllight checks which Alan's mentioned.<br><br>In my current assignment in Syria with a water utility organisation, I am developing documented procedures for the commercial management side of the business (the bit that often gets ignored and impacts sustainability).  What the staff currently do has never been documented and the improved ones must also relate to the new billing and customer management system.<br><br>So I am adopting the inclusion of checklists into the procedures and the person repsonsible will have to check off all the vital tasks and submit the signed sheet daily.  Why?  Because I need to get the new procedures embedded deep enough to become habits,<br><br>The it struck me: I had better practise what I preach in the hope that it too will make the worrisome tasks become a matter of habit.<br><br>Keep the ideas flowing, as long as none of us overcomplicate things and diverges too far from Mark's principles.  On the other hand, we must find what works for us as individuals!</div>

<div class="content">+AJPM+<br><br>Cricket,<br><br><<Do you find it gets confusing, with some tasks having more marks than others?>><br><br>Not really, and I am not really sure why.  Maybe it's because I treat each checklist as a system checklist, in that I have it in my mind that if one component does not work, then the system as a whole is not 100% efficient.  That means subconsciously that I have to be more careful in checking my items.<br><br>Another thing may be because I do not allow my checklists to get too long.  The scanned page I showed above is the average length of each checklist: 5-15 items is the range when I checked them just now. I just found that if they are more than that range, it is better to find a better way of dividing the tasks.  That's how the Morning, Midmorning, Afternoon, Evening, and Daily Unscheduled Upkeeps emerged.<br><br>Of course that is just speculation, but no, I have not found it confusing over the month that I have been using it.<br><br><<I used to use charts I made in Excel for recurring tasks, with the tasks down the side and dates across the top.

<div class="content">@nuntym: once again, thanks for starting a very good thread!<br><br>I may have missed something, but is the A5 list as you write it in the 'main' AF4 list?  Do you write them every day in that sequence?  Could you show us part of your current AF4 list in practice?  Do you mix up Work and Personal all on one list?  I'm currently using two AF4 lists in an ongoing drive to keep focused on work issues.<br><br>I llike what I see and have read from you and others, I'm just wondering about the 'overhead' from writing these regular tasks.  When you've done say, Mid Morning, do you add it again to the end of your AF4 list like any other 'recurring' task.<br><br>As I use Outlook, I was wondering about using the Task Manager to bring the checklist up via a reminder, with the individual tasks in the notes/text space in the task window.

<div class="content">I've tried both rewriting,  checklists and now I'm using small post-its like Erik. Obviously the things I do everyday are getting less sticky. So I'm working on doing them slightly different, making a new note and keeping things more interesting. I had a trainer that moved equipment around the gym and changed the size, color and location of the notes she put up to say our dues needed to be paid. Just like muscles our minds get dull to the same stimulus.<br><br>I also read The Checklist Manifesto, it is fascinating, though it made me a bit wary of flying or being operated on. I wish there would have been some examples of lists. He mentioned  they made them short and printed them in large type. I think check lists are important for things you would like to or need to delegate at some point.<br><br>It's so interesting to hear how every one is keeping the ball rolling. I do miss using a nice pen on good paper.</div>

<div class="content">You know this talk of checklists reminds me slightly of the flylady approach. They advocate having checklists - say a morning one, a lunchtime one, an evening one. The checklist contains a list of all the tasks you should do - for example get something sorted for dinner, load washing machine, and so on.</div>

<div class="content">Checklists are great when there's a lot of things to remember because it transforms the tough memory challenge into a very easy one: remember to look at the checklist.  Next it provides a foundation to improve something. Before you always did ABCDE. Now you want to do AFCBGE.  Going by memory and habit this would be a monumental change. Going by checklist, it's quite easy to pull off.</div>

<div class="content">@Erin: I think the examples Atul was dealing with are pretty comprehensive and may be a bit technical to non-medical/aviation readers.  On the contrary, I'm even more relaxed about flying or going under the knife if I know they are using checklists, especially as such checklists are constantly revised as necessary.  My wife is not gung-ho about flying, so I encouraged her to watch 'Air Accident Investigation' and 'Seconds from Disaster' on the documentary channel; she now understands that each accident leads to safer flying later.<br><br>She's still not overly keen, which is why I never told her last month that I was going up in a WW2 Tiger Moth open cockpit biplane trainer until after I had landed!<br><br>@Alan: as usual your post is succinct and goes to the heart of trying embed a checklist!<br><br>Last night I was watching Part 1 of Band of Brothers again, the episode contains the paratroopers getting ready to board their C-47s/Dakotas before the night drop into Normandy.  The one Easy Company soldier walks around calling out every item he, and his colleagues, is supposed to be taking with him, and wondering how he's going to be able to fit it in/on AND climb aboard.<br><br>It struck me as a perfect example of a checklist in action, with not a pen or iPhone in sight!</div>

<div class="content">@Roger: Yes, your are right, we are safer because of Checklists. What is amazing about the book is the actually measured improvements in hospital care. <br>@Alan: Good point, habits are like music or poems, they work best remembered in sequence. I find checklists slow me down, but they have saved me.</div>

<div class="content">Checklists are my friend, at least some of them. I used to rhyme off all the things each kid is supposed to do before school, before TV, after dinner, etc. Yep, if I forgot something they'd watch TV before everything was done and blame it on me. Now I just say, "Is the list done?</div>

<div class="content">+AJPM+<br><br>Over the past 2 1/2 weeks since I posted this thread, these had been my observations concerning Maintenance Checklists:<br><br>1) The "Filtering/Pre-Filtering" AF4 tweak outlined in this thread,<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1262814" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1262814</a><br><br>is, in my experience, much more effective in reducing overwhelm than the Maintenance Checklist.<br><br>2) The only Maintenance Checklists left in my system are the time-sensitive ones: Morning, Midmorning, Afternoon, and Evening.  All the others' tasks were re-incorporated into the main AF4 list, and they were effectively managed by the "Filtering/Pre-Filtering" AF4 tweak.<br><br>So ends the experiment, I guess.  But it was a success, in my opinion: I have a more streamlined, efficient, and effective AF4 list now.<br><br>God bless.</div>
