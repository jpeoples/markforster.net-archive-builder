<div class="meta">2009-02-12 0:52</div>
<div class="content">Hi Mark and all, I bought the DIT book only last week after weeks of anticipation and feeling the need for some fresh thinking for my GTD-based system. What a great book! DIT has brought a new impetus to my daily work planning and actually getting things done. However, just as I was up and running with my first current initiative, my will-do list and my "in today and out tomorrow unless it cannot possibly wait" work cycle, I read about Autofocus.<br><br>I am apparently not the only one to experience some confusion on what the arrival of Autofocus means for DIT. The more I read the Autofocus instructions, the more I get the intuitive logic in the system. However, I sense there are many DIT principles that remain intact, including the fundamental manana principle, closed lists in some situations, task diary (for items that should only be done on a specific day in the future), the current initiative etc.<br><br>I think it would help to have some specific guidance from Mark on where Autofocus works within or alongside DIT and where it is intended to upgrade or supercede it. I assume the intention was not to throw the baby out with the bath water! Have I missed anything that addresses this specifically on the forum?<br><br>My own situation is as a senior manager in a small international consulting and business research firm, but working from home. My work is characterised by regular hard deadlines, a short project cycle requiring disciplined short response times on most items (even though DIT is usually OK) and multiple levels of responsibilities that require structured review and consistent follow through. As it is a small, flat client-facing organization, it is unfortunately the case that being overcommitted is something one has to get used to. A lot of my work-related tasks may not be hard calendar items but they also not entirely next actions to do whenever I can get to them either, as they have a narrow window of opportunity to get done. DIT seems well designed for this type of environment, supported by the collection, processing, organizing and reviewing processes of GTD.<br><br>In my situation I see a fit for Autofocus primarily in productive use of discretionary time to move on "next actions" that genuinely can wait if necessary but still represent active commitments, including many of my "personal" items. This is a category of my "commitments" that has been the main sticking point and source of neglect and resistance in GTD. Autofocus provides an ingenious process for 1) regularly reminding oneself of all the outstanding items; 2) providing a structure to incrementally move on aged or backlogged items; and 3) deleting items that are no longer commitments or moving them onto some form of someday/maybe list. I therefore work the GTD process on the front end, use DIT to batch work and manage daily work load and have set up a "daily task" to review and spend some time working on my two Autofocus lists (@home for home/after hours and @office for work/business hours) for next actions that "stand out", whenever my schedule allows.<br><br>I appreciate this may seem an unconscionable hack of the system. And when new systems are uncovered it is tempting to believe they have complete and universal applicability. However, I see the system applying to the greatest extent for people who have more discretion with what they get done when and can work one list in an intuitive manner. My sense is that in more structured, fast-paced, high-volume work environments, Autofocus has a role more as module/category of task management within a larger system. In other words, it's horses for courses.<br><br>Interested in Mark's and others' thoughts on this and whether there are any GTD-type Autofocus beta testers that work in a similar environment to the one I described that have made a complete shift to Autofocus and found that it works even with a high volume of calendared or time sensitive items and a need to track and review multiple tiers of commitments.</div>

<div class="content">In regard to the Do It Tomorrow principle, it seems to me the essential principle there is "don't act immediately on new inputs" -- put some space between the new input, and taking action on the new input.  DIT defers the action till the next day.  AF defers the action to "whenever you get to that page and the item stands out".  But in both cases, the essential principle is the same.<br><br>My first reaction to AF was similar, though -- it seemed like DIT was just being cast aside.  But the more I work the AF system, the more I realize how it embodies the same principles as DIT.  But AF is like hyper-DIT -- it follows all the same principles, but an order of magnitude more effectively.<br><br>Regarding your other questions...  I personally work on a deadline-driven, high-intensity team in the semiconductor industry.  Our current project has me focusing on multiple critical priorities, as well as tracking the progress of other team members and trying to help keep us all on track so we hit our big deadline at end of quarter, which is looming over us.  The mood often swings between "if this project is a success, it will do great things for this business group!" and "how in the world did we ever get into this mess???"  :-)<br><br>Anyway, I've been using AF to help manage my own workload, and all I can say is that it is *especially* good at dealing with multiple high-pressure deadlines.  As long as you keep your list fairly "lean and mean", and stay current with working the AF system, it is surprisingly effective.  I actually feel far more in control of my workload than I've felt in a long time, and have more and more confidence that I can meet my deliverables on time.<br><br>When I say "keep it lean and mean", I mostly mean, don't overload it by transferring too many things from your old system.  I do have a recurring task "tfr stuff from old system", and occasionally transfer a few things, but mainly focus on whatever is currently on my mind.  This works really well.  My first attempt at AF was different -- I copied over everything from Outlook and my Toodledo list, but it was just too overwhelming, and most of that stuff just wasn't "fresh" anymore.  Sure, copy it over sometime, but in small chunks.  But besides that, I do throw everything else into the system -- voicemails, emails, random thoughts, random tasks that pop up throughout the day -- and it handles them really well.<br><br>At home, I'm probably trying to do even more, and it's somewhat harder to keep that list "lean and mean", but still, it is the best system I've found.  <br><br>At both home and work, every other system I've tried ends up dropping things -- if it's not critically urgent, a task gets lost in the shuffle.  With AF, that doesn't happen -- if something gets lost, it gets lost on purpose, or at least for a reason (meaning, it gets dismissed, or crossed off because I realize it was a silly idea or just not important).  <br><br>Anyway, that's been my experience so far.  Still overwhelmed with too much to do, but AF is helping me realize what's most important and keeps me focused there.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim<br><br>That's really great to hear how AF is settling down for you in that high pressure high turnaround environment.<br><br>Benjamin<br><br>One of things that many of us have found, especially when we are coming to the system with a backlog of old stuff as Seraphim mentions, is that it can take a while to learn how to use the system to it's best advantage for our individual scenarios.  It is essential to stick to the instructions, but there is a lot more flexibility within the instructions than is sometimes appreciated.  It is the learning of how to use the system in the best way for you that is important.  For example, using one notebook for all or using separate notebooks for different locations, identifying the best way to use our scheduler, the way we use our project management system/s, the way we define tasks, using the "common sense" rule where appropriate etc.  A lot of these things actually change quite considerably, as AF itself enables us to see how best to use the system and when and how to "trust the system".<br><br>I use a number of techniques, terminology etc from Mark's previous books - AF does not nullify the benefits of those books but adds to them, restates things in perhaps a different way, and enables us to identify why one thing works well for us when another doesn't.  That can be a major key to changing our approach to things.<br><br>As a Beta Tester from day 1, I have now been using AF for nearly six weeks.  That in itself is remarkable and is the longest I have consistently benefitted from any system. Apart from the ridiculous amount of tasks I have actioned, as a result of using AF I have questioned so many areas of working and changed practices in many of those to quite an amazing degree, also far more than with any other system.  I have met deadlines without stress, identified areas that are really important to me, and made inroads into my backlogs.  I still feel that I am just beginning and am still excited about how AF will continue to work going forward. The thing is that learning how to use AF from a mechanical perspective is easy - learning how it "really" works is a true learning experience and that experience improves the more we practice.<br><br>Good luck with your journey!</div>

<div class="content">Simon (and others):<br><br>When I wrote the instructions for AF I was aiming to provide something self-contained - in the sense that someone wouldn't need to have read any of my books (or anyone else's) in order to make it work. And I suspect that probably is the case with the majority of people who are using it.<br><br>But obviously whatever principles were true in DIT and GED (not to mention GTD) are still valid - the principles themselves that is, not their precise application. So using what you've learned from any of these books in conjunction with AF is fine - just so long as you are careful not to destroy the essential characteristics of AF.<br><br>One thing I used to counsel again with DIT - and it applies just as much to AF - is overloading the system with unnecessarily heavy project planning methods. This tends to be something that people coming from GTD are particularly prone to!</div>

<div class="content">Definitely agree with regard to "unnecessarily heavy project planning methods".  Whilst my overall project planning requirements have not changed per se, AF has encouraged me to drastically overhaul the way I planned them which has "lightened the load" so that they now feel totally different. I am still working the same projects, with the same tasks, but with a streamlined system thanks to AF.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks to all for the feedback. I guess I will only know if it works for me if I jump in and test it out... once my current work crunch subsides and I can experiment with new methods. For now I still need some of the old props that I have got used to, for better or for worse...</div>

<div class="content">Benjamin<br><br>I think we can all relate to the need for our old props, our "security blankets" if you like. You are right in that you will only know by actually trying it out.  Don't rule out using the system with your current work crunch.  I would say "don't be afraid to" but when you have a sizeable work pressure situation then fear seems almost a natural by product.  All I can say is, when I started AF I had some horrendous issues with tight deadlines, that my logical instinct would have insisted that I concentrate on to the exclusion of everything else.  AF worked for me in that scenario, although I can't say it wasn't scary.<br><br>Good luck!</div>

<div class="content">Benjamin, your original post has articulated very clearly the issues I have with AF for work (large public sector management role). Little discretionary time, after meetings and producing work for deadlines, and after keeping up with the daily load of emails. I love the AF approach and can totally 'get' what AF is about, and am using it for home/personal tasks, so I am not a sceptic about the method.  And I've also benefitted for a brief couple of hours in the last week or two at work where a gap in the daily essentials left time to look at the AF list - and I was surprised at what it's helped me do (I especially like the idea of a mini AF list for the sub tasks within a big offputting task.)  But generally I have to work to the diary and project commitments, for which GTD framework, and DIT techniques provide the main structures I need for keeping sane.  If you do manage to breakthrough the barrier to make the looser structure of AF work for you in this kind of environment, plse let us know! Good luck</div>

<div class="content">Benjamin, Jane, <br><br>I can totally relate to your feelings re the promises of AF vs. the reality of work. When I tried AF at home (for the little time that I could do so), it worked. But in my workplace, it keeps getting crushed by high-pressure (i.e.: absolute) and very short (measuring in hours or even minutes, not days) deadlines, interruptions, meetings and a nearly industrial workflow. <br><br>I once posted a question about those very short deadlines, but I don't have the impression there has been a solution. Mark proposed prioritizing by urgency only, but that's exactly what I have been doing for years, and why long-term, important but not urgent projects have been cast aside and deferred for sometimes ridiculous time.<br>DIT could be a solution to that, but it lacks a lot of the potential of AF, and switching between basic modes of operation seems to be quite difficult for the human mind. I tried the 'additional index card' method, but the urgency addiction quickly began to overrule AF.<br><br>It's about time the 'one size fits all' stance is abandoned (this it not meant to be offensive against you, Mark). As far as I can oversee the time and life management 'landscape', there is too little assessment of which methodologies to use for specific personality types and/or work situations. Maybe I'm expecting too much, but I have the impression that this assessment should go first.</div>

<div class="content">Alex,<br><br>You really hit the nail on the head.  I get the impression that time management authors write/create systems for their own personality style and context.  It simply does not make any sense that a system that will work for the CEO of a Fortune 100 company would work for the assembly line worker in that company.<br><br>It is clear that one can lay down general principles (such as: make time for the important things so the urgent ones don't crowd them out), but for each different personality type there is going to be a good way and a not so good way to implement those ideas.<br><br>With AF, it is clear to me that it operates outside of a calendar driven context.  If your day is spent in meetings, then AF is not going to be as helpful as if your time is completely discretionary.<br><br>Those writers who have addressed how to work in the kind of high pressure environment you describe advise "getting away" from it so that you can do your bigger more important projects.  Easier said than done, but the idea is that if you are out sick the work somehow gets done.  So just schedule a "meeting" off-site and meet with yourself to spend an hour or two working on the big things.  Or so they advise ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Jane, Alex, Mike,<br>Glad to hear others having similar thoughts and perceptions.<br>I may try out full blown AF at some point, but I do not see conceptually it working for me on its own based on the workflow I currently have.<br>I agree that different systems align better with different people based on their personality, circumstances and work styles. The trick is to keep an open mind and adopt techniques and systems that work best for you and your unique situation.<br>I see quite a few people on this site and on general blogs writing off GTD as it were some fad whose time is past. I think this is mistaken. People just want something new once in a while. It just does not suit everybody. And it is essential to stick to the basic principles and adapt the details to what works best for you. Good ideas never truly expire. I think that's true for GTD, DIT and Autofocus, as long as you engage with the systems, adapt them to your circumstances and make them work for you.<br></div>

<div class="content">Whilst I do not have the same volume of urgent, high intensity fast turnaround, stuff that Alex talks about, my week is very fractured, some with a lot of discretionary time and others with virtually none.  However, as I use the same list for home items I am likely to use it in the evenings and at weekends, and also in any snatched moments such as travelling - by train not car :-) <br><br>What I find is that the very action of keeping my lists fresh in my mind is that tasks do get done, not necessarily according to the structure of AF "I am on page 1 so can only work on items on page 1" but on the basis that my mind will somehow identify tasks that can be done in those limited discretionery time periods when I may not even be in a position to look at my lists.  Consequently the tasks do get done, the pages get cleared, and I make progress.<br><br>This seems almost to be operating outside of the lists but I feel it is more a hidden feature of AF which I suspect operates most effectively in the high pressure, low discretionary time, type environment.</div>

<div class="content">All:<br><br>I think there's a bit of confusion in this discussion about what exactly it is that a system like AF (or DIT or GTD) is intended to do.<br><br>These systems are about managing your discretionary time. If you don't have any discretionary time, then you don't need a system to manage it. You simply do what you're told to do or take action on whatever presents itself next. It's only when you have a choice about what to do that you need a system to give you a framework in which to make that choice.<br><br>So Mike mentioned an assembly-line worker. Why would an assembly-line worker need a time management system? All he or she has to do is follow a previously laid down routine.<br><br>If you spend *all* your time in meetings, then you don't need a time management system. You just turn up for the next meeting. <br><br>If you spend *all* your time dealing with urgent items as they come up, then again you don't need a time management system. You just deal with the items as they present themselves.<br><br>But for most of us that is not the situation. We have times when we have no choice what to do and times when we can choose what to do. AF and the other systems are about managing the time when we do have a choice.<br><br>AF in other words is about managing your discretionary time. If you have no discretionary time, then AF is not for you. It is not intended for you and you don't need it.<br><br>The problem comes when you don't have enough discretionary time for the number of tasks which require discretionary time.<br><br>In which case there are really only three things you can do:<br><br>1) Reduce the number of tasks requiring discretionary time (e.g. by auditing your work load)<br><br>2) Increase the efficiency by which you make use of your discretionary time (e.g. by using a system like AF)<br><br>3) Increase the amount of discretionary time you have (e.g. by avoiding overscheduling, or by improving your procedures for handling non-discretionary tasks)<br><br>In my experience, AF is the best method of managing my discretionary time that I have ever come across. I have been in some pretty high-pressure jobs in my time and I only wish that I had had AF back in those days.</div>

<div class="content">Amen to that Mark.<br><br>I so wish I had had AF in the past - the less discretionery time I have the more I need for it to be used productively, whether that be to do tasks or to get quality leisure time.  Without some sort of system that time just gets lost.  Things may get done but not recognised. Leisure items may happen or just be bypassed with procrastination.  Thank goodness for a system like AF which can balance that time!</div>

<div class="content">Mark says: "The problem comes when you don't have enough discretionary time for the number of tasks which require discretionary time."<br><br>I would add that a bigger problem for me has been the "get everything done" or "getting things done" EVEN WHEN THERE IS ENOUGH DISCRETIONARY TIME. Whether you call it "procrastination"  or "fear of failure/ success" or "aversive tasks"  or "psychological blocks" etc etc etc, AF has been an enormous help to me in this area. (GTD had FAR too much mental overhead in separating into contexts and next action steps for it really to be workable in-the-moment for *me*.) One can do all the careful planning and/or scheduling in the world, but if one has the discrectionary TIME but can't get one's self to set up that xmas present from 2 years ago, it really doesn't matter!<br><br>I do realize this kind of fits into Mark's "2) Increase the efficiency by which you make use of your discretionary time (e.g. by using a system like AF)" but I think it doesn't really do justice to one of the most powerful benefits of AF, and I don't think most people would call their "procrastination" problems a problem of "efficiency."<br><br>Anyway, I just wanted to highlight this extremely empowering aspect of AF.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-02-15 9:31</div>
<div class="content">Mark,<br>I think the problem several of us are interested in exploring is - what is the best way to organise ourselves to meet the short/ medium/ long term commitments we have, when much of the day is full of pre-programmed activities (towards those commitments) or the need to keep pace with latest information or short turn round requests.  It is not that we (at least I) don't have any discretionary time.  It is that my way of spending it is driven by which report is due next, which meeting papers I need to read next, keeping track of what I need to discuss with whom, and am I keeping up with my emails - all overlapping in timeframes, levels of importance and potential for impact.  It is the job of the manager to balance those 3 factors you mention (working efficiently, doing the right amount of work, and getting more time to allocate to the work) to get the best results in the time available.  <br><br>Given all that, I'm interested in whether 'pure' AF is the best tool for juggling all this, or whether my existing tools ('collection' book for real time notes, appointment diary, task diary and project list, agenda sheets, plus daily email slot) are best retained alongside an AF list.  In practice I use all the above to write a will do today list (a la DIT) which is helping.  I think this could be similar to the 'hybrid' versions of AF talked about already on the forum.  One thing which would be a useful addition (I think) to the AF instructions is how to use it alongside other tools such as those I've mentioned. <br><br>Anyway, this is a great forum, compulsive reading and I am very impressed (relieved!) to find there are so many thinking people out there who are as keen on their lists and organisation systems as I am!!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jane P<br><br>Any time specific tasks should be kept outside of the system by means of a schedule or diary or whatever tool is best suitable.  AF is also not a project management system but does work alongside to manage the time elements and tasks of a project.  The type of schedule/diary and/or project management system will ineviatable vary from person to person.<br><br>You say "It is that my way of spending it is driven by which report is due next, which meeting papers I need to read next, keeping track of what I need to discuss with whom, and am I keeping up with my emails - all overlapping in timeframes, levels of importance and potential for impact."  It is these very issues that AF works incredibly well at.  It would appear that your existing pattern as described above is very much planned rationally by what you believe to be of most importance, and that you use the same criteria for your will do list.  <br><br>AF works in a totally different manner.  The instructions are that all items are listed - those items are not graded, for urgency, importance, or by any other criteria.  The system itself handles that by means of the item/s standing out at "the right time".  <br><br>Basically everything, with the exception of scheduled items, is best handled by AF, including email (by means of a check email task), reports, reading, projects (either by blocks of time or as individual tasks), although the project management itself will generally be handled outside of AF.   <br><br>Hope that helps ....... :-)</div>

<div class="content">Jane:<br><br>Christine has given a very comprehensive answer to your question. AF is better at managing one's discretionary time than one's rational brain on its own. I would also mention the difference between managing a project (which is not in the scope of AF) and managing oneself within a project (which is).</div>
