<div class="content">One of the most helpful aspects of Mark's systems is the habit of ongoing engagement with one's lists (tasks, projects, etc). David Allen has his own take on this in his coaching around Weekly Reviews. In summary, one should review every active project - weekly - and ensure there is one Next Action associated with each project. <br><br>I'm trying to bring to the fore the above ideas. I purchased an index card bleacher from Levenger - <a href="http://www.levenger.com/home-office-22549/desk-accessories-organization-23000/nantucket-bamboo-compact-bleacher-18083.aspx" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.levenger.com/home-office-22549/desk-accessories-organization-23000/nantucket-bamboo-compact-bleacher-18083.aspx</a> - and index cards from Baron Fig - <a href="http://writeexperience.com/blog/baronfig-strategist-to-do-cards-premium-and-useful-index-cards" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://writeexperience.com/blog/baronfig-strategist-to-do-cards-premium-and-useful-index-cards</a> <br><br>Each index card with represent one project, and will always have one Next Action associated with it. The bleacher will ensure the most important/pressing projects are dab smack in front of my face. <br><br>Curious to see if these tools will help me engage with my commitments on a more regular basis.</div>

<div class="content">I’ve never thought to bleach index cards before but this does seem neat. I have mounted cards on a wall on more than one occasion. Or sticky notes. <br><br>“one should review every active project - weekly - and ensure there is one Next Action associated with each project. “<br><br>I am in total concordance with this advice.</div>

<div class="content">I am using out of sight, out of mind for the opposite purpose, which is to say that I am specifically hiding things so that they don't come to my consciousness too often, and I rely on my ability to regularly review so that I know I can focus on a single thing in the moment without having to constantly see and be convinced that I'm still "on top" of everything.</div>
