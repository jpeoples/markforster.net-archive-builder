<div class="content">Such a flurry of activity this week!  That can only lead to great ideas becoming even better ideas.  Here's my idea, which I've been holding tight for three months because I wanted first to be sure it works.<br><br>The Fundamental Idea:<br>The system uses an AutoFocus type framework to encourage these work habits: <br>	- Focus only on a few things you've started.  Stay focused.<br>	- When something new comes up, put it  off.  <br>	- When you want to work on something new, first work on something old, so nothing gets forgotten.</div>

<div class="content">Usability<br>The system works extremely well with my project system, in my contexts : <br>Work (OneNote) - many projects, several daily interruptions, some urgent things.<br>Home (paper & clipboard)- some projects, no interruptions, nothing urgent, much optional work.<br><br>The project system helps me aggressively dismiss tasks from AF.  My oldest AF task is less than two weeks old.  Important stuff, if it can't be done in short order, will get put in a tickler or project.  <br><br>I have not tested the system beyond these contexts or without this project management.</div>

<div class="content">History<br>I've been searching on and off for a system that meets the above goals since January.  Most things I tried floundered,  but in August I found a winning formula.  <br><br>In essence, it was AF4 with three lists: Closed, Open, and Focus.  [But not like Mark is doing now.]  This worked, and better than AF4.  But it bogged down:  When the Closed list doesn't clear fast enough, then Open gets too big, and Focus loses its focus.<br><br>Last week I solved the above problems  by cross-breeding the system with AF1 and DWM.  The result no longer resembles AF4, but retains the above essence.  Stay tuned for details.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Alan, <br><br>I would be interested about a step by step example. It's not very clear for me. <br><br>What I understand is that you are indeed interupted in your work. So you divided your task list in2. One is about the incoming tasks, you will do them later (ie DIT ? ) the secont is what you are working on. So if you work on project X you don't do anything else but project X. <br>Then later you focus first on older tasks or project and then will do the tasks you put of...<br><br>Then you have 3 lists <br>one is the close list = backlog<br>one is the open list = The active list<br>one is a special call focus list where you have your most important tasks .... <br><br>Is that right ?</div>

<div class="content">Sounds like some sort of AF2 to me. You work on the new stuff, then go back to the old stuff,  work on it or dismiss it, then back to the new stuff. Very interesting.</div>

<div class="content">Close Rainier but not quite. It's like AF2 in the working pattern, but the content of what's worked on is very different  That's more like DIT in that you always work on things you picked to do, while new stuff is explicitly kept inactive until you put aside your focus list.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Alan.

<div class="meta">2010-11-4 12:41</div>
<div class="content">You are right about the mix, and about balance, but there isn't anything like AF4's active list.<br><br>The Focus list only has tasks you recently chose to work on.  These could have come from either the open list, or a closed list.  <br><br>The second-last page, which in AF4 might have been called Active certainly isn't active in this system.  It consists of previously active tasks and new tasks, but you only examine it occasionally.<br><br>Good luck.</div>

<div class="content">Let me try again.  Look at the last page. It's got a list of things.  Draw a line under that list, as in AF4.  Now add a new page, and call this your new Focus.<br><br>The line has no meaning in the rules, but it's a visual cue separating what you were working on from new ideas.</div>

<div class="meta">2010-11-4 14:54</div>
<div class="content">Alan,<br><br>Thanks for explaining the details.  Seems a little complicated to me, but I like the idea of deliberately putting off new stuff, like DIT.  I never tried DIT, because I feared  the Tomorrow list might become an overwhelming Today list in short order. In your system, you deliberately add a Focus page, but there is nothing in the procedure to prevent *that* page from growing into yet another overwhelming "active" page. So you have the anytime-refocus step. When I use any system for productivity, I like specific rules to help me get in the flow. Perhaps the refocus should be done when your current focus page has more than N undone items on it? If so, I would set N to 3. You would also need to force a refocus if the current Open or Focus page gets filled up, right?<br><br>Another issue I anticipate is that this system may end up having a bunch of half-empty pages. Whenever you refocus, the previous Open page for new entries might not be filled up. But it now becomes a shorter closed list. This is the same problem that DWM has.<br><br>Your other novel idea - choosing at least one item either to do or to dismiss before turning a page - could be used to modify AF1 as well. I wonder what Mark thinks about this. I have a vague recollection that there was much discussion in the past about the merits of page-level vs item-level dismissal...</div>

<div class="content">Yes, the New Page rule is incomplete.  Ideally it would tell you when to make a new page, but I haven't figured out when is best, so I left it unspecified.  Flexibility may be an advantage though.  I have tons of possibilities you could try.<br><br>AF4 mode: When the first page clears, I tried this for a long time, and it really pressures you into dismissing.  But sometimes the first page doesn't clear fast enough, and sometimes it clears too quickly.<br><br>DIT mode: near the end of your day, create a new page.  Scan through the pages selecting the important tasks you want to achieve tomorrow, and prepare for each of them, thus shifting them to the active page.<br><br>"No wasted paper": when the Focus page is3/4 full, or the previous page is full.<br><br>Refocusing: A trick that fits the flow of the system: If you pick up too many tasks from going around, just start a new page and only reactivate a few tasks from the current focus.  You don't have to go through everything again.<br><br>New context: If you are switching contexts, start a new page, and pick up tasks that will be useful in the new context.<br><br>Project-zoom: Take a project page or checklist and copy tasks from that into a new Focus page.<br><br><br>Re the other novel idea: I don't recall that discussion.  But here only the first page demands something be chosen and worked on.  If you had to chose one thing on every page, you might get too many things.</div>

<div class="content">Alan,<br><br>You wrote: "Re the other novel idea: I don't recall that discussion."<br><br>IIRC, in the early days of AF(1), there were some folks who would dismiss certain items while scanning, rather than waiting for no items to stand out on the first pass through the page. I believe Mark suggested the we just follow the rules, as your intuition/mood might change and those items might become 'ripe' for action on a later pass.<br><br> You also wrote: "But here only the first page demands something be chosen and worked on. If you had to cho[o]se one thing on every page, you might get too many things."<br><br>Ah, I missed that part, that you only have the 1-or-more do/dismiss rule on the oldest page. In AF1, every filled page is a closed list and is treated the same. I have now gone back to AF1, so I'll think about this some more. I like the idea of some sort of added pressure to clear out the oldest page...</div>

<div class="content">In light of Mark's experiments with a 3-list, it seems a good idea to stick to the bottom of the focus list, following AF2's strategy but on this small closed list.</div>

<div class="content">John C Maxwell says that your best ideas can't be your best ideas until you share them and others help make them better.  That seems true. So better idea 1: (thanks nuntym)<br>Instead of two pages combine Focus and New on one page divided down the middle:<br>New | Focus<br>----- | -------<br><br>Better idea 2: (thanks Mark, ubi, and Gerry)<br>When working the Focus list, stick to 3 tasks at a time, and get 2 Done. If there's a second phase to a task, consider that New and write on the left.<br><br>The effect of this is there's no need to refocus, so the new page rule becomes the obvious:<br>If the focus page is full, start a new one :-)</div>

<div class="content">@Alan<br><br>I really like the fact that you want to share your ideas with everyone and add to the whole :)<br>It has been one of those revelations to me that it is probably the most important things that give meaning to our lives. Continue the great work! For my part, I think you where right to start with explaining the idea and concept before going into details.<br><br>On another hand, I'm trying to grasp the idea of the Focus page and how the dynamics of it work but even with actually trying it... I can't make heads or tails of it !?! That said, one things really stands out. It's the fact that you must activate or dismiss something. Dismissing is a key part of Autofocus that often takes the backseat. With that "rule" in mind and having to rescan until you activate or dismiss, it helps alleviate the feeling of unease of dismissing a bunch of tasks at a time not knowing if you did the right thing...</div>

<div class="meta">2010-11-8 3:25</div>
<div class="content">Thanks for the encouragement Erik!  Following the revised page configuration, the focus page has new tasks on the left and active tasks ( what I have been working on ) on the right, and you would loop through tasks on the right side only. Here's how that plays out in practice:<br><br>Effectively there are two phases in the system:<br>1. Picking (and starting) tasks from the full list. <br>2. Working recently picked tasks. <br>Suppose I have no tasks on the right (focus list). Then I will scan through all the pages, maybe picking 10 along the way and doing a little work on each as I go. <br><br>As I return to focus, I repeatedly pick among those 10 only. Likely I will stick to just a few (3) and get those few progressed, and later switch to a few others, and the rest don't really need more work at this time. <br><br>New stuff will be written on the left, but I should not work on it yet. If it's truly necessary I must switch to the picking phase and pick more tasks, old and new.  The effect is to discourage distraction because normally I don't want to pay the price to start new tasks before I finish the current ones <br><br>One useful work pattern is to start a new page shortly before leaving work. Then I scan through looking for what I want to do tomorrow and prepare each.  Then my focus list is exactly my DIT plan, and I have each task ready.<br><br>Likewise, if I'm going on errands I can start a new page, collect tasks useable on the road, and then get to them.<br><br>These are the current ideas. I'm open to refinement.</div>

<div class="content">About the "do tomorrow" preparation.  I find it more useful to just prepare *some* of what I will do, rather than everything.  That way I can <br>a) get going and accomplish much of it early in the day, and grab some more work, or<br>b) get going, detour for an interruption, or two, and still complete my day's work</div>

<div class="content">My System of focusing tasks also works with DWM2:<br><br>1. Each day write a new date as per DWM2 rules.<br>2. Enter tasks exactly according to DWM2 rules.<br>3. Dismiss tasks exactly according to DWM2 rules.<br>4. Scan through all tasks starting with the oldest. Work on any, and rewrite with a black dot.<br>5. Now Focus exclusively on today's tasks with a black dot.<br>6. When you want to work on something else (including today's items without a black dot), go to 4.<br><br>I follow the above process except for two things:<br>- Instead of dots I use two columns: left = new, right = re-entered.<br>- I don't dismiss by date, but by lack of activity.</div>

<div class="meta">2010-11-13 12:25</div>
<div class="content">Having read through the various posts, I'm not sure I understand Alan's system. However this is my best shot at an overview:<br><br>Alan's system consists of two unequal parts. A  main list and a focus page. The focus page is populated by unfinished tasks re-entered from the main list. Once you have finished working on the main list, you work on the focus page for as long as you wish, while new tasks continue to go on the main list. Once you've done as much work as you want on the focus page, it is absorbed into the main list and a new focus page is opened.<br><br>In Super Autofocus on the other hand the rules are the same as for AF1, except that a second column is added to each page which can be used to add tasks to full pages when you are working on them. These are either unfinished tasks or urgent items.<br><br>In fact there's very little resemblance between the two systems (if I've understood Alan's correctly). In Alan's system the focusing comes at the end of a pass through the whole list. With mine the focusing is continuously on what one is working on at the time.</div>
<h2>Reply by Alan Baljeu</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-11-13 14:23</div>
<div class="content">You sum it well.  Except the "absorbed into the main list" doesn't happen every time 'round.  Also, in later posts I suggested that rather than 2 pages you have 2 columns: left is unactioned tasks, right is actioned tasks.  <br><br>The systems are similar in these factors: 2 columns, re-entry on right, page by page working, focusing on one page for a while, and a general autofocusy style (record everything, go round and round, dismiss at appropriate times).<br><br>The primary mechanical differences are only three: rewrite to last half-page vs. rewrite to current half-page, and loop each page vs loop last half-page, and the dismissal rules.<br><br>The practical differences are though VERY significant:<br>- Look through everything quickly, vs. look at one page<br>- Focus only on a few things you've started, vs. focus on one page at a time<br>- When something new comes up, put it off vs. do it now if you want<br>- Work old pages before new vs. every page treated equally.<br><br>The difference is because Super AF comes out of AF1, whereas my system evolved out of inverting the AF4 open/closed list [which doesn't work], and DWM's separate treatment of new and re-entered tasks.  <br><br>(I never got into AF1 because it didn't make sense - in my context - to work everything equally.  Some things need to get done now.  The rest need to get done, but not now.  Running through AF1 meant either dismissing many pages of stuff, or else taking too long to get to the few things that need doing now.)</div>

<div class="meta">2010-11-13 15:01</div>
<div class="content">Alan:<br><br>I'm not quite clear about something. When you go through the old pages, are you actually working on tasks and then re-entering them if unfinished on the focus list, or are you simply selecting them for the focus list without working on them?<br><br>I assumed it was the first when I wrote my summary, but I'm not so sure now. "Look through everything quickly" seems to imply that all you are doing is selecting things for the focus list. If this is the case then the two systems are further apart than I thought.<br><br>On the other hand you describe the right hand page/column as "actioned tasks" which seems to suggest you are working on them..<br><br>If this is the case then how do you deal with urgent tasks that come in while you are at the beginning of the list? Do you just abandon everything else and rush to the end of the list? If so, in your context of many things that need doing now, how do you ever get through the whole list without being interrupted?</div>
<h2>Reply by Alan Baljeu</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-11-13 15:54</div>
<div class="content">Your first guess was correct.  I insist on working on things to activate tasks.  This discourages grabbing too many things, and encourages preparing to actually get stuff done.<br><br>To achieve "Quickly", I keep my list short, and pick very few things. Usually this takes under an hour.  If something is "right-now urgent", I'll go do it.  More usually it's "same-day urgent", and I'll get to it shortly.  <br><br>E.g., Phone rings, I answer it.  Talk to customer.  They have a problem with a file.  Need it fixed today.  I write it on my list as a new thing.  I continue what I was already doing, wrap that up [done for now], then go get that new thing, following the rules.<br><br>The biggest factor to avoid interruptions is that I anticipate what will come up.  I know the things going on around here, and generally those things are on my Focus list.  <br><br>E.g., I see an item languishing. I know it's important, so I ask somebody working on it, how it's progressing.  Note response, item is activated.  Now I might use that active item plan what's next, and the interruption "I'm done" just fits my flow.<br><br>P.S. Visiting this site is currently on that list.  I visit when I need a break.</div>

To see it, I need to scan through all the pages.  In something like DWM, that's allowed.  In AF1, I must pause on each page and do something on each.<br><br>I also really like how currently I can look at one page and know it has everything I need to do.<br><br>Having said that, I think Super AF looks very good, and it would be awesome if everyone could rally behind one system.
