<div class="content">Hi all,<br><br>how do you combat overcommitment?  I find that I am having a hard time estimating what can be done in any given time-frame, and so more often than not things get either really tight, or postponed or not done at all (all not good).</div>

<div class="content">Joshua:<br><br>What time management system are you using?<br><br>Autofocus helps with this if you follow the rules for dismissal properly, since these make you look carefully at why you are doing certain tasks.<br><br>DIT requires you to audit your commitments if you don't succeed in keeping up with your work.<br><br>Apart from these, the best way to improve your ability to estimate what can be done in a given time-frame is always to record an estimate of when you think an important task or project will be finished. Then when the task/project is finished compare your estimate with the date it was actually finished. <br><br>If you find that you are constantly underestimating certain types of task then you can increase the length of your estimates, and vice versa.</div>

<div class="content">Joshua,<br><br>I presume that you are referring to things that once you have committed to you feel obliged to do, such as meetings. We had a bit of a discussion of this on <br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/760674" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/760674</a><br><br>though I don't think that we came up with any easy answers.<br><br>Otherwise, enter potential commitments into AF and dismiss them according to the rules (takes time to learn that, and I am still not very good at it myself)</div>

<div class="content">Joshua<br><br>One thing I found helpful was to set a task of "thinking time" and then I stopped and really thought as objectively as possible about my commitments.  I am very much overcommitted in some areas but not all of them can be changed.  That exercise caused me to look at the best ways of managing the commitments that I am not able or willing to give up and look at the other demands on my time.<br><br>It is easy when in a state of firefighting to concentrate only on the immediate fire and not the tools or lack of them that we have to fight it, or alternatively to see what is feeding the flames.<br><br>In my situation, I realised that my "problem" was less my commitments than firefighting problems caused by my backlogs.  The fact that those backlogs were not all incurred through my own fault is irrelevant and bemoaning their existence is about as unproductive as you can get!  The only solution is to clear that issue, put out the lingering fires and move on and that is where I am now.  The fires are still there but nearly manageable - the backlog is still there but reducing - and there will come a point at which my time will match or, more probably, exceed my commitments.<br><br>Sometimes there are no quick fixes and hard decisions need to be made.  It may well be that you are in an interim period of "clear out" which needs to be done before AF can work to it's full effect.  It is definitely worth stopping to take stock and see whether those commitments are genuine or a result of firefighting.</div>

<div class="content">Norman: you're starting to sound like a a poor man's version of mr miyagi<br><br>To add to other points: <br>I know I have have set unrealistic expectations on how long it will take me to get things done. Consistent use of a time management system is obviously a big help. The only problem is that if you're dealing with tasks that involve uncertainty, novelty, dependencies and other factors, it's hard to provide a good estimate even if you've got a realistic sense of how long you take to get things done. <br><br>I've developed a few other rules of thumbs that help me with projects. <br><br>I've often seen that projects deadlines often exceed 2-3 times its initially intended finish dates. Much how like big projects usually cost two to three more times than what was originally estimated. To counter that you could set an initial estimate and multiply it by three. <br><br>The problem with that strategy is that usually people take the time that is alotted to accomplish a task. If you set out to do a task in an hour or two hours, in both cases you might be able to succeed, but in the latter case you will have spent an hour longer.<br><br>To counteract this I not only 'multiply' my original estimate by three, I set two types of deadlines. One is a 'public' or hard deadline. This is 3 times the estimate of how long you think you'll need. The other is a shorter 'private' or 'internal' deadline, you set this to 1/3 or 2/3rds of your initial estimate. For maximum effect get someone who you can be accountable to, to hold this deadline, but is in now way related to your 'hard deadline'.<br><br>Example:<br>You're asked to complete a big report that involves quite a bit of analysis, research, and so forth. You estimate you'll need 3 weeks to complete it. If possible, state to your client it will be completed in 9 weeks. <br>At the same time, set an 'internal deadline' of 2 weeks and schedule 2 weeks of work accordingly. Communicate the deadline to colleagues and get to work. <br>You might find yourself completing a project in record time without bearing any stress. In any case you're pretty much certain that you'll complete a project within the hard deadline. The internal deadline keeps you efficient and stopping from procrastinating. The external deadline makes it easy for you to exceed external party's expectations: it's now realistic you can meet your deadlines ahead of time.  <br><br>Likewise, using your initial estimate as an anchor for making decisions about your commitments is very useful. Before taking something on, ask yourself how much time you think it will take you. Then multiply it by three and ask yourself if you'd still be willing to do it. If the answer is yes you're almost certain that this is something worthwhile. It makes saying 'no' to people asking you for your time much easier. <br><br>This strategy doesn't apply for every situation, but it does work for a good many and it does help prevent over-committing. <br><br><br><br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Norman, I think he was asking HOW to quit doing so much. In other words, how does one choose how much to do and which commitments to keep. <br><br>Joshua, a couple of things that have been helpful to me:<br>1) Determine how much time you have for discretionary activities. Once you factor in sleep, meals, must-do job-related tasks, etc., how much time is left? Then determine how much time each discretionary activity takes and the decision-making is a little easier.<br>2) Have someone hold you accountable. I just asked my dh which of a long list of big commitments I should take on this summer. He said, "None." That wasn't an option I was even considering, but I'm so glad he said it! That's exactly what I plan to take on. :-) Often in the course of describing a potential commitment to him, I realize I shouldn't take it on. Other times he says go for it. I HTH even though it took me more than four words to say. :-)</div>

<div class="content">Mel,<br><br>I get that, but I doubt that I can give anyone insight to what their priorities are. AF does a good job of this. Read the FAQ, look at the stuff you are not doing, and ask yourself if you truly want to be doing them.<br><br>I found when I was stressed and not enjoying what I thought I had to do, I pretty much could have used a dartboard to eliminate stuff I was doing and it would have helped.<br><br>AF is better.<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Norman<br><br>I totally get that you don't like my long posts and maybe the ultimate answer is very simple, but I know that I have previously found it helpful when someone has taken the time to detail their experiences.  That has quite often lead to that "aha" moment for me and I tend to work on the basis that if something works for me, well, then it just might work for someone else.  Hence my long, possibly rambling, but hopefully occasionally helpful posts.<br><br>I can only hope that they may be of help and so will probably continue my musings but please don't feel you have to have to read them all.  I can see that you prefer much more concise communication and that is absolutely fine - just something I'm not particularly good at myself :-)</div>

<div class="content">I think the problem here is once again related to personality. Bob and Norman like short and to the point. People like Christine and I prefer something a bit longer and more colorful. That doesn't make either approach wrong. My preference would be that we'd read the posts that are our style and wouldn't critique those that aren't.</div>

<div class="content">Christine,<br><br>Your point on firefighting backlogs is relevant and useful. I don't think we should expect you to edit it down for publication: your life is too short.<br><br>Norman,<br><br>Perhaps this is something you would like to take on now and again? That would certainly be valuable for the rest of us, and you seem to enjoy the pithy summary.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Joshua,  <br><br>In terms of estimating how long things will take - I'm good at this at work, but not so good with things I'm less familiar with.  I would follow all of the advice above - especially Mel's point #1.   It depends on if your commitments are what you perceive as optional or not.  I've had jobs where it didn't matter how I estimated (and I always under-estimated) I was just overloaded.  If they are optional, then start learning to say no to everything that isn't your core job that nobody else can do.  There's no reason you can't come back and help someone else out later if you have the time.<br><br>If it's non-optional things - I would use Neil Fiore's Unschedule approach - get a copy of a weekly calendar with ~ 1/2 hour time spots, put in your recreation and committed things.  Then you see how much time you have left for actual work on the projects.  Then, instead of scheduling what you're going to do in those slots, write down what you actually do (in hindsight).<br><br>Or you could use this in conjunction with AF:<br><a href="http://davidseah.com/blog/comments/emergent-task-planner-free-version-updates/" rel="nofollow">http://davidseah.com/blog/comments/emergent-task-planner-free-version-updates/</a><br><a href="http://davidseah.com/blog/comments/emergent-task-timer-updates/" rel="nofollow">http://davidseah.com/blog/comments/emergent-task-timer-updates/</a><br><br><br>I like the short, get to the heart of it comments (even if I don't do it myself).  I didn't have time to write a short comment, so I wrote a long one instead (apologies to Mark Twain)<br>.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Joshua, you may find the Pomodoro Technique by Francesco Cirillo very useful for estimating task  time - the inherent feedback loop is also a useful feature for improving furture estimates based on past experiences.  There is a free downloadable book at www.pomodorotechnique.com <br><br><br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">First of all: Thank you to everybody who replied to my question!  I had to finish off a project for work and therefore did not get to reply to you before now.<br><br>I will work through your answers and get back to you.<br><br>Thank you again very much!<br><br></div>

<div class="content">My recommendation is - try AF for 4 weeks, if you are still stressed out and not managing your time as you (and others) think you should, write a list of your projects, then tick off the ones you can delegate, ones you can ask to be put back, ones you can ask to be reallocated to someone else, and ones you would like addtl. resource to delegate to. - then start tackling you overcommitent by entering appropriate actions into AF.  A staged approach to this is recommended to avoid coming across as someone who just cant cope and all the stigma etc that entails.<br><br>AF can only go so far, then you must grasp the nettle and seek to reduce your commitments.<br><br>Hope this helps,<br><br>Derek.</div>
