<div class="content">So I'm still experimenting with Dreams, with varying amounts of success.  It can be tough to trust my feelings because I'm a bit OCD about knowing how exactly to do it.  Right now I'm strugging with how to ID "green lights" and how they come up.  Like, do you just let them happen to you, or do you try to summon one up somehow?  Is it more like a "oh, sure I'll do this", or a strong impulse, or a genuine sudden desire?  Having tasted the last one, I want to try and recreate that feeling.</div>

<div class="content">I'd say you were feeling for inspired action from your inner wisdom, rather than motivated action (an outside-in approach, which can be self-demanding and self-instruction). I believe this best arrives when you are relaxed enough to receive it. It doesn't seem forcible on demand to me. Perhaps the opportunity here - the gift in the challenge as it were - is the opportunity to develop that awareness. Perhaps the inner goal, rather than the external achieving type goals, is to allow yourself to come to that state of trust in your own wisdom. A guided meditation or visualisation may be one route to that, eg <a href="http://www.meditationoasis.com/2010/04/26/accessing-intuition-guided-meditation/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.meditationoasis.com/2010/04/26/accessing-intuition-guided-meditation/</a><br><br>You might also pose yourself the question "What would I love to do today?" and return to it from time to time. It seems to engage imaginative possibilities.</div>

<div class="content">A similar question is : "What is my heart saying?"<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2006/8/14/listen-to-your-heart.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2006/8/14/listen-to-your-heart.html</a></div>

<div class="content">I wonder if there might not be a range of answers to this question. My own response is written as a woman, a meditator, and a social worker -- all of which have shaped my ways of knowing and "listening" and which therefore shape my experience with Dreams. <br><br>In following Dreams, my biggest struggle is to quiet my rational mind, which is full of "shoulds" and deadlines and to listen at a deeper level. Mark documents his own experience with this quite well in his book. You yourself describe how hard it is to let go of control.<br><br>I like Marks's comment about listening to the heart. I think Dreams requires listening to yourself at a level that is deeper that that of the rational mind. Different people have different images of this process: listen to your heart, what does your gut say, intuition, womb-knowing... <br><br>I think the logical, analytical and rational approach we have strongly developed in the Western World is both a strength and a limitation.  When following Dreams, I think we need to learn how to access other ways of knowing and other ways of being (beyond the rational mind). I love it that Dreams is so integrative and holistic... It's what gives it its power and strength, but it's also what makes it hard to do. <br><br>My advice... Find your own metaphor, listen to your inner knowing in a way that resonates for you.</div>

<div class="content">I do know that I like a little structure, but I became concerned with trying to use that structure to force a green light.  In a way, doing so can seem like another kind of Push Mode.  For me, I'm more motivated by a life purpose than a vision - I'm a performer at heart and I've practically done so all my life.  But I'm also worrying about how to properly tap into that without forcing it.  For me resistance tends to pop up easily - it might be worth asking "what would I love to do today" as more of a feeling than a question, so I can bypass that.</div>

<div class="content">It wouldn't hurt to break things down further, though my primary concern is to have that driving force in place to give me meaning.  Otherwise, why bother doing anything?  I'm still working on that - surprisingly tougher than I expected.</div>

<div class="content">michael:<br><< To bring clarity to "standing out" it may help to reconsider<br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2006/9/9/plus-or-minus.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2006/9/9/plus-or-minus.html</a> >><br><br>Thanks—what a nice little article! (And thanks, Mark, for writing it.)<br><br>While breaking tasks into smaller steps is not a new idea, this little scheme of writing plusses and minuses makes a simple game of it, when otherwise our resistance invites us to turn away from the list altogether.<br><br>As an Autofocus user, I am thinking of the following amendment:<br><br>If something stands out on an AF page, action it as usual (it is a "plus" item), but if nothing stands out (i.e., all items are "minuses"), make another scan in which you imagine each item preceded by "write the smallest initial step of ..." If any of those rephrased items stand out, cross them out and rewrite the smaller-step version on the open page. Tasks that don't stand out on this pass are so far gone that you don't even want to *plan* them! That's okay, you'll be seeing them again.<br><br>And now, congratulations: you've just actioned some high-resistance items! You can action their little steps when you reach the open page.<br><br>Alternatively, you could always keep in mind that "write a small initial step of ..." is a perfectly good way of "actioning" any AF item at any time. Now, generalize that: "Clarify ..." can be a way of actioning an item. E.g., jot down "landscape lighting timer losing time" on the open page, really more of a complaint than a task, and later, "action" it by rephrasing as "call electrician for estimate on timer." This truly allows writing *anything* in the list, even when you are too busy to formulate it as an action.</div>
