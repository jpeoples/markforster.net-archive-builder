<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-02-20 11:38</div>
<div class="content">I've been using DWM for nearly three weeks now and I suspect, after a year of attempting to stick to AF, that this may actually be the one for me.<br><br>My problem has always been that I don't spend much time on-list, so I don't cycle through it very often, and I tended to cheat the dismissal rules on AF.  I needed a system that I could look at quickly, find a task that needed doing, and do it - and a dismissal system I might actually stick to.<br><br>With DWM, I was initially worried that there would be too many pages to flip through to find what I needed to do quickly.  I have RSI, so actually flipping through 15 pages to see the month's worth of tasks is sometimes a bit of a pain - with certain types of notebooks at least.  But I've now settled on a little soft-back sewn notebook that's much easier to flick through than the ADOC/Circa type book I was using before.  I'm writing two days on each page, giving me up to nine tasks on each day.  For me, that's usually enough.  It allows me to see the whole active list by flipping over eight pages, which is OK.  <br><br>I go through the list at the beginning of the day, and put an asterisk next to each task that really needs to be done that day (or on either Saturday or Sunday if it's the weekend) and so I can easily see what needs doing when I look at the book during the day.  If I feel like doing anything else, I can scan the list quickly to find something that appeals to me.  <br><br>Tasks in the future that I'm resistant to slowly march closer to the present, during which time I often find I gradually come round to the idea of actually doing them - ie they don't scare me so much (my procrastination is perfectionism-based, and I often don't start tasks because I'm afraid I won't do them well enough).  With AF, they hung around on the list, making me feel guilty that I wasn't doing them.  With DWM, they're safely in the future for a while. <br><br>The fact that there is today's date on the page that is about to be dismissed seems to make it harder to ignore it and cheat.  Today was the first day I had tasks left to do, and I was tempted to cheat as I had two tasks left and not a lot of time to work on them, but I did in fact do a little on each one and saved them.<br><br>I'll see what happens in the coming weeks, or when things get stressful.  But I think this might be the system for me, the one that suits both my working pattern and my psychology - so thank you Mark.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Annette,<br><br>This paragraph of yours:<br>>>Tasks in the future that I'm resistant to slowly march closer to the present, during which time I often find I gradually come round to the idea of actually doing them - ie they don't scare me so much (my procrastination is perfectionism-based, and I often don't start tasks because I'm afraid I won't do them well enough). With AF, they hung around on the list, making me feel guilty that I wasn't doing them. With DWM, they're safely in the future for a while.<<<br><br>. . . . sums up my reaction, and like you I think unreasonable perfectionism underlies my procrastination, but I now, in my senior years, am worrying less and less about it, and this is partly due to the relative success I've been having with AF4 and even more so with DWM.<br><br>That phrase 'safely in the future' captures for me the essence of DWM, and the Current Initiative handles accumulated backlogs to date IF I feel like it.</div>

<div class="content">Annette, that sums up my reaction to MWD, too!<br><br>You mention having two days per page. When I first set up my paper system, I was travelling and didn't have access to a real calendar. I wound up drawing one myself, with SEVEN days across the page in long, narrow columns.<br><br>For anyone who doesn’t like flipping through the infamous 31 pages, you could try a set up like that. I found is was plenty of room to list my tasks. <br><br>(I may have been inspired by the look of www.teuxdeux.com).</div>

<div class="content">Annette<br><br>Your post has inspired me to re-try DWM!<br><br>When I started using it, in a page-a-day diary, I gave up in disgust after half a day. I know it was not the thorough testing that Mark wanted but I could not get my head around it all. Since then I have been lurking on the web site, reading lots of glowing reports about DWM and feeling left-out in a petulant kind of way!<br><br>I think it was your suggestion of using two days on each page which swung it, as I am VERY resistant to flipping through 31 pages. Using it the way you describe allows me to see four days on one 'spread' which I find very reassuring. The whole month's tasks can be accessed far more easily and so there is less concern about missing an important task.<br><br>Also, your comment about how DWM helps you to overcome perfection-based procrastination rang a bell for me, as that's one of my biggest problems. So here I go with DWM (again).<br><br>Thanks very much to you Annette (and all other posters) for your suggestions. They have been very helpful.</div>

<div class="content">I think a useful metaphor might be "zoom".  Mark's system is zoomed in to a single day at a time.  Some seem to like it zoomed out to various degrees: two days, a week, a month, or perhaps even a year.<br><br>I know I have a one year poster on my office wall on which I have key deadlines and blocks for vacation, projects, etc.  Of course, the information I can put there is basically only a symbol or two.  I also have a single month (rewriteable) on the wall which is the next level of zoom in.  My book has a monthly page as well as pages for each day.  I usually check the monthly page first to see what is on the horizon, then I scan/work the pages.<br><br>I think that one way or another we all pretty much scan and zoom to move around our landscape.  I think that is why I was having a hard time getting why there were so manyh complaints about "flipping through 31 pages".  I don't "flip" - I "plod".  ;-)  After seeing my zoomed out view, of course ;-)</div>

<div class="content">I am working on DWM again using a digitial setup -- all in Outlook 2007.  I use a lot of GTD contexts, but with the beauty of the pending dates of doom in DWM, this combination may have finally work well for me!<br><br>-David</div>

So in a way, DWM is Autofocus with  a zoom lens added. :)</div>

<div class="content">"DWM-Zoom" requires the Welsh pronunciation (I think) for DWM = Doom!<br><br>Actually I'm finding impending doom arising from undone stuff reducing markedly with DWM with touches of AF4.  Equilibirum as per Alan B?</div>

<div class="content">I take it you mean hovering around the upcoming tasks rather than going through them all?  I remember Mark saying that didn't work well for him.  Myself I'm generally inclined to follow his advice but in this case I'm far too  motivated to stay focused on the front end, that I find it hard to break away to the later weeks.</div>

<div class="content">Alan B:<br><br>If I interpret your question correctly, yes, I am tending to look at the short-range stuff, but not exclusively.  Perhaps I'm trying to blend DWM and AF4.<br><br>Like you, I'm also more motivated to zoom in on the front end, but when I feel inclined, I do scan the whole list, sometimes as a break from the front end focus.<br><br>Perhaps it's the fear issue you raised that's working!  Whatever, DWM in my incarnation is the best I have ever come across and is producing better results than any other approach.<br><br>I'm also being more pragmatic when entering new tasks;  most do indeed go into Today + 28, but if I know it's better or should be done earlier, I'll allocate an earlier date.  Of course, non-negotiable dates (eg VAT returns) are given reminders as well in Outlook even though I do include such items in DWM.</div>

<div class="content">@Linda<br><br>Best of luck with your second attempt at DWM!  I nearly gave up on it more than once, but as I'd written the tasks into a new DWM notebook, I decided to stick with it for a while to see what happened.   It probably takes a while to see whether it's going to work for you or not.</div>

The idea is that the date entered does not mean date due, only how long it waits on the list before you kill it.</div>

<div class="content">Mike, Lillian,<br><br>Thanks for feedback, it's good to have other insights.<br><br>You, and Mark, are right,  but the times I do break the 28 or 7 rule are in the minority.<br><br>If  the REAL ABF date for a new task only just on the radar, due to omission or commission, is < 28, then I'd rather do it adjust the date; it's still out there in the future, as opposed to previous practices which advocate noting it by date of entry.  <br><br>So far it works for me. which for me is all that really matters, but I'll keep on reading comments on the forum, which I believe is one reason why DWM et al are successful.</div>

<div class="content">Roger, I agree. If the actual expiry (due) date on a task is less than one month away, I enter it in DWM with its actual expiry date. It seems a bit daft to insis upon anything else, really.</div>

<div class="content">Roger, Trevor - <br><br>So where do you put things that need to be done today? (I don't mean something that popped up a couple of days ago that needs to be done today. I'm talking about the stuff that comes up at 10am that NEEDS to be done today, but it's not a 'drop everything and do immediately' task.)<br><br>*If* you put it on today+28, what's the difference between that task and a task that pops up today that needs to be done by next Friday?  (which sounds like you'd put on next Friday's date instead of today+28) <br><br>If you don't put the 'must do today' task on today+28, um.. well, then, I guess you can ignore this question... :)</div>

<div class="content">So far, I've found that entering new tasks according to the rule with a note as to the deadline (I'm leaning towards making it +28 instead of +30, but the principle is the same) AND entering it on the "Appts" side of the calendar on the date it's actually due helps relieve any anxiety I have over remembering to get it done.<br><br>That _may_ be a violation of the "limited entry areas", but since it keeps me using the system I will keep the tweak.  Basically I'm using the "appts" side of the calendar as a tickler file, so that I only have to carry one calendar around.<br><br>I think that if I were to _only_ enter it on the day it was due, I would completely lose the benefits of this system (having the "freshest" tasks in predictable places.  So far, I like being able to see how long I've been thinking about doing something, but not acting on it.  One problem I had with AF4 was how long some tasks would sit around without my acting on them, dismissing them, or rephrasing them.  Another was not having a way to deal with calendar items.  DWM does offer room to deal with date-sensitive items along with non-date-sensitive ones.<br><br>I'm still playing around with the format I like best--I've been using various notebooks and paper or index cards I already had so I'm not investing any money till I see how it will work after more time.</div>

<div class="content">I, too, feel that this is the system for me.<br><br>When I first started it, I was in the midst of preparing for comprehensive exams, so I added a major modification: Instead of cycling through the 28 pages repeatedly, I went through it once in the morning, pulling out the tasks I thought I would actually do that day. I can see why I felt I had to do that ~ it was a crazy couple of weeks, and I knew I would not be able to cycle through the list more than once, if even once, and I had to get the essential tasks done.<br><br>But now I've had a week of normal life again, and I decided that Mark's rules will work best during normal times.<br><br>I also made my own pages, and bound them with a plastic comb binder, because I can add and remove pages to keep the book slim.<br><br>My newly designed pages have a narrow column on the left for calendar items, and the rest of the page is for the list. I am cycling through the list several times a day, for both work and home, and it's working out great. I like having the calendar on the pages, too, because it keeps reminding me of upcoming events. It also seems to make a stronger connection in my mind that there are things coming up for expiration, and when they do expire, I think of them as "in the past."<br><br>Psychologically, I feel like I am doing things "ahead of time," maybe because they are on dates for future pages. With previous systems, including AF, I just felt like it was a huge list of things that have been on the list seemingly forever, and I felt "behind."</div>

<div class="content">There's nothing wrong with putting a reminder in your diary/ calendar.<br><br>Entering a new task any time other than one month/ 28 days out or a continuation any time other than a week out is a major change to DWM. Given that this is a beta test and Mark is asking for input, there is nothing wrong with that, but he will need to agree to the change. So far, I believe his position is clear: we should not do anything that confuses expiration date with due date. DWM tracks due date by writing it next to the task: you have to get through the whole list multiple times a day.</div>

<div class="content">All the recent respondents:<br><br>Interesting feedback, food for thought. reminder of the basic principles etc.<br><br>I have to admit I like that comment about the "freshest" entries being in the same area of the list and the helpful reminder that the list should be processed several times a day.<br><br>Perhaps Will's contribution is the way to go, add a reminder in Outlook, but keep to Mark's principles.  I think I prefer that to annotating the task with the do/due date.<br><br>Lillian: those NEED to to TODAY tasks that swoop into the system at 10h00, I write down ALL new tasks "below the line" at the end of my ListPro report which is printed at the start of the day.  As described by me elsewhere (ad nauseum, ad infinitum??), during the day I enter new tasks with the pen on the ListPro printed page.<br><br>At the end of the day, I review the printed and handwritten tasks.  Hopefully those 10h00 type tasks will already have been done and as with other done tasks, will never make into the ListPro system.<br><br>Of course, CRITICAL MUST DO ASAP tasks should be done without any recourse to the list, as I think Mark has advocated from AF1 onwards, except maybe to reflect on any sins of omission or commission which may have prevented the urgency.</div>
