<div class="content">I'm curious to know how long it takes others to begin and finish their pages, and how that's changed since beginning AF.  <br><br>My longest time to complete a page was 64 days - I think I had 25 active pages or so at the time.  Most pages that I have completed lately have been turned around in 26-28 days in my home book, but my time to complete is getting consistently shorter.  <br><br>I think it's useful to monitor this stat to see how far in advance you can put things on your list and know it will come up at the right time.   Also, you can determine if you want a project done in the next x weeks, whether you should enter the whole project onto the list or not.  <br><br></div>

<div class="content">I don't keep stats.  It was a conscious decision on my part to avoid falling into the trap of becoming an "AF Junkie" ;-)  Seriously, one can get all wrapped up in methods and forget that the idea is to get things done (not the "system", of course, but the end result ... LOL ;-)  I'm also a recovering GtDer).<br><br>I can tell you subjectively, however, that the time has been steadily shrinking.  I think that is because I have been writing more discrete tasks.  I've also been writing simpler tasks.  One of the first tasks on my currently first page (remember, I trash them when completed) is: <br><br>- Clean the bathroom and find the shower radio and replace the battery<br><br>OY.  That hung around for a while and kept the page active because it is too complex.<br><br>Now I would write:<br><br>- Clean Bathroom<br>- Find shower radio<br>- Find battery for shower radio<br>- Put radio back into shower<br>- Burn copies of some CDs to put in shower radio<br>- etc.<br><br>Writing smaller tasks has made the pages turn over more quickly.  I currently have 35 open pages of 15 lines per page.  I think I have been stable at about that number for a while now.  Most of my early pages are down to only one or two items, as you'd expect and will be closing soon.  (I've had some really big tasks that have kept me moving through the AF list more slowly than I will be now.)<br><br>As to the right time ... I don't have that problem as one of my tweaks is to review my list daily and see if there is anything on it that needs to be done right now.  Ironically that has an interesting side effect.  I kind of know all of the items on my list so if I'm walking through a room I remember that there is something I need to do there and will just do it.  Then on one of my reviews I'll see it (out of order) and mark it complete.  YAY!  ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Usually 10-14 days, with approximately 28 items/page.<br><br>However...<br>I move through my "work" list multiple times daily.<br>I move through my "personal" list every couple of days.<br><br>So... if there is something time-sensitive I know I will get to it in that time-frame; I don't see how long a page stays active as being related to the urgency of items.  I suppose it does give you a relative time-frame of when things will be either done or dismissed, though.</div>

<div class="content">Mike, I write the date down beside it because in case I lose my active page, I can tell where I've ended off.  I also like to be able to tell someone "yes I did that on April 4" just because I've been burned a couple of times in the past by not writing down the name of some person I was speaking to, say if you're cancelling a service or something.  <br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br><br>I've been caught by that one too!  When a company assures me they have dealt with something my brain is obviously still hot-wired to those dim and distant days in the past when people did what they said ........ why, oh why, am I still so trusting ......:-(</div>

<div class="content">I have abandoned almost all of my tweaks involving tagging or noting items or pages with start and end dates.  The reason?  It made it too cluttered for my eyes to get through the list quickly.  I would notice that my internal processing on each item got very long as I saw dates, tags, stars, lines, arrows, bullets, etc.  I could not see the reason to keep stats as I saw that the system obviously was working for me.  Those things that I started out tagging I simply moved to their own list: ticklers, shopping, etc.<br><br>As to those gotchas you mention ... I've  always been aware of that and I manage it by keeping a log of what I'm doing ... people I've called, the name of the person I talked to, what they said, the reason they gave, etc.  I have found that if I'm able to say: "I talked to Jackie on March 3rd at 3:04pm and she said she was reversing the charge and that I had been charged in error because they inadvertently put the payment through twice." ... then I was better able to make my case.  If I simply said: "I called before and someone told me that it was handled." ... I had much less credibility and had to go through the whole thing again.  I also put this kind of thing on my tickler list: "03/15/09 Credit from XYZ - $123.45" and cross it off when I see the credit on my bank statement (which I check on line daily, BTW.)<br><br>Trusting ... it is one of those hope for the best but be prepared for the worst kind of things.  Business is becoming more cynical and devious.  I had one company (XM/Sirius) charge my credit card for services I'd discontinued ... and that to a credit card that had expired and for which they had asked me to re validate with a new expiration date and I had refused!!!!  Another company (Comcast) tippled the price of my internet service ... a SECOND time ... with no notice.  I had to go to the government oversight people the first time to get it all reversed as they simply hung up on me or put me on hold forever.  It has been six months or so and no they have done it again.  I mostly have bills paid automatically but this company has proven that they can't be trusted not to simply steal my money if I give them access.<br><br>I'm sure most businesses are honest but when you identify those that are dishonest, you have to watch them like a hawk ... unless you can find an alternative.  Unfortunately there is no alternative to Comcast here.</div>

<div class="content">Mike you are so right!  So much customer service has become reliant on computers and as people are only trained to believe what the computer says ....... :-(<br><br>Very rarely have I had problems with a business being genuinely dishonest (if genuine and dishonest can go together!) but it's the inefficiency of businesses that really causes the problems.<br><br>And what really gets me are those systems that create ridiculous scenarios, such as the fact that, because a debit card acts like a guarantee you cannot stop transactions.  I had a company in Australia debiting my account, and because it had not been reversed quickly enough the first time, when they claimed the same amount the following month it became "a recurring transaction" and apparently "could not be stopped"!  I was told by my bank to contact the merchant directly (but they could not tell me who they were!), to contact Visa Australia, to contact the police in Australia, and to contact the police in the UK.  Even though I knew what they were telling me was ridiculous I had to do as they said or they would have said I wasn't co-operating!  To cap it all, I changed cards and they transferred the authority to the new card, and told me "the system did it automatically because it was more convenient for the customer!"  Over a year later and I now have an overdrawn account my bank can't close, and which is still affecting my credit rating! Huh!   <br><br>I'll climb down from my soapbox now! :-)</div>

<div class="content">I guess if it takes longer in days than the no. of lines on your page then you can't be touching all the pages in a day. So that would be a bad number to go much below.<br><br>But I've stopped putting anything at all on the page now other than the tasks - I found even adding a date here and there was distracting and spoiled the flow somewhat.</div>

<div class="content">Sarah, that's exactly why I track how long it takes to complete a page - I am trying to get to a point of "this month we will renovate the hall bathroom", so then I know I can put everything related to the bathroom on the list, and it will be finished within that month.  I think you could apply this to a lot of things, if you knew you took about 30 days to get through a page, and you wanted to read 4 books a month, you could write them down on the list and know they would get read.  (Assuming you don't dismiss).</div>
