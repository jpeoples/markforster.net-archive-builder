<div class="content">Hi Mark (and everyone else),<br><br>Well, January (the accountant's nightmare) is now over, so the time has come to get a "proper" system in place before it all starts again.<br><br>This is what I have in place at the moment, so any ideas or input on how I could improve it would be immensely appreciated!<br><br>1)  I have a notebook with a list of tasks to do (not the date-driven ones though) - like AF I guess.<br>2)  I have a will-do sheet which I print off daily whereby I "tick off" my daily tasks - such as e-mail, voicemail, back-up, that sort of thing - the stuff I have to do every day.<br>3)  I have a list of where all my client's bits & pieces are in my office (eg Fred's books are in box 1, Mary's books are in box 2 etc).<br>4)  I have a date-driven "reminders list" (created on Excel) which tells me how many days until accounts are due, etc, etc. (quite vital for not missing deadlines!)<br>5)  I have a diary where I write all my appointments into.<br>6)  I have a new computerised system which I have just spent a lot of money on which should ultimately replace point 4).<br><br>I would ideally like just "one" system instead of having to refer to different ones on a daily basis!<br><br>If anyone can offer any insight, ideas or thoughts, I would be most grateful!<br><br>Jason</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jason,<br><br>First of all ... Breathe ;-)<br><br>The main thing to realize is that your goal should not be system driven, but rather results driven.  IOW, don't try to minimize the number of systems or anything at all with reference to systems.  You should use whatever works.  Clearly, if there is a way to combine functions, you probably should do it but don't sacrifice function for the sake of a nice system..  SO:<br><br>1) I have a notebook with a list of tasks to do (not the date-driven ones though) - like AF I guess.<br><br>This could be AF, if you like how that system works for you.  It is basically a TO DO list.<br><br>2) I have a will-do sheet which I print off daily whereby I "tick off" my daily tasks - such as e-mail, voicemail, back-up, that sort of thing - the stuff I have to do every day.<br><br>Why do you print it daily?  If it is a list of routines then they are ... well ... routine ;-)  Make it once, post it on the wall or in a picture frame on your desk, then see it all day long and do them.  Personally, I have my routines on 3x5 cards in a 3x5 file box filed according to a 43 folders system ... Jan - Dec & 1-31.  I got the idea from a book by "The Sidetracked Sisters"  ;-)  I use colored cards for the repetition period: White = Daily; Blue = Weekly; Yellow = Monthly; Red = Annually (or bi-annually).  When I do what is on the card, it gets shuffled to the proper date for the next occurrence.  I find it useful for those kinds of things where there is data along with the reminder: "Replace furnace filter; buy filter #1234 at Store X; etc.)  Obviously, this could be a task in Outlook with the attendant data in the body of the task, but I set this up years ago and see no reason to automate it as it is working just fine as it is ;-)  But you could make these "appointments" in whatever system you are using and have them pop up when needed.  It all depends on how involved it all is.<br><br>3) I have a list of where all my client's bits & pieces are in my office (eg Fred's books are in box 1, Mary's books are in box 2 etc).<br><br>That is basically an index and does not relate to the other things nor can I imagine how you'd combine it with them.  Personally, I'd put those into a  computer file so you can quickly search to find things ... maybe Access or Excel ... even a Word file is searchable.  OT ... hmmmm .... you could also enter this kind of thing as notes in your contact list -- again, if using something like Outlook you could add that info to each client's record.  But be sure to print out a paper copy for your files and keep it current.<br><br>4) I have a date-driven "reminders list" (created on Excel) which tells me how many days until accounts are due, etc, etc. (quite vital for not missing deadlines!)<br><br>Below you say you have replaced it with a special system.  That is smart, but again, I'd also print out a copy and keep the printout current (monthly, perhaps).  Again, this does not fit with the other things so needs to be separate.<br><br>5) I have a diary where I write all my appointments into.<br><br>Now that might be somehow combined with # 4 because they are both basically a calendar.  My simpleminded approach would be to use something like Outllook with dates for deadlines and appointments all entered as appointments.<br><br>6) I have a new computerized system which I have just spent a lot of money on which should ultimately replace point 4).  As above, 4,5,and 6 could all be the same system.  Possibly 3 as well if it handles your contact list in some way.<br><br>Just a few thoughts.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Jason<br><br>A few thoughts on your system - <br><br>I guess from the fact that you don't feel you have a "proper" system in place that this is something that is causing you anxiety and from your comment at the end of your post the fact that you have "so many different systems" is something you want to change.  Mike is absolutely right when he says "you should do whatever works" - the problem is usually to identify what that means for you.  Creating one system is actually not as hard to achieve as you might think.  At this point you are looking at all of your procedures etc as different systems - if you view them not as systems but as system components , that can change the perspective with which they are approached.  I personally use and recommend a number of different "system" components (both hardware/software/filing systems etc) but I feel that the key to the "single system" concept is actually what you overlay those components with to manage them.<br><br>As an accountant you will always be working with multiple components,  probably using numerous software packages in order to handle client accounts, and having to manage client records presented in varying formats.  There are methods of standardising that type of scenario, and from my experience of AF over the past few weeks it can be an excellent tool in that process.<br><br>My current "system" is easily managed through AF and also my project management system within Microsoft OneNote.  The tools for AF are simple - a notebook and pen, with the addition of a scheduler of some sort and the ability to deal with time specific tasks on a practical and productive basis.  If you start with AF, using a notebook and doing AF exactly as per Mark's instructions, that will deal with (1).  I would recommend including the daily tasks within that same notebook - my experience is that those routines are actioned more easily that way and don't get forgotten as can be a concern.  (There are postings on alternative options for such tasks but my recommendation would be to at least give AF the chance to work with these items before looking at other options).  That will deal with (2). <br><br>I use MS OneNote as my project management system, and keep within that my Schedules (monthly calendar format) and any other lists.  Your list of clients' stuff can be kept here and you can also use AF to update that list by means of tasks such as "set up box for client x" or "amend details for client x" etc.  If you use OneNote as a project manager, then you can have a page for each client including links to their box no and notes, and also embed their files into that page.  For example a page could include an embedded Sage or QB file, their tax return, VAT returns etc and be managed from that source. That would deal with (3).<br><br>Excel is not the most efficient resource for such a list - Outlook would handle such reminders more efficiently.  The creation of those reminders can also be recorded within AF so that you do not forget to record or update them.  The benefit of making that original update task in AF is that you do not need to be at your PC or in any particular location - if you are at the client's premises you can still record it into the system. That would deal with (4).<br><br>I keep my schedule within OneNote as I mentioned above but items in OneNote can be directly tasked straight into Outlook.  If you are travelling and use a manual diary then just treat that as a separate tool and make a routine task within AF to "update schedule" whether that be in OneNote or Outlook.  That would deal with (5).<br><br>Without knowing details of the computerised system it is impossible to be specific, but depending upon<br>how it acts as a scheduler you may be best to incorporate that as your schedule/reminder "component". <br><br>Of course there are added "components" such as how you store your client records (which is actually pretty important and has more of an impact in your type of business than may be realised), physical filing systems etc.<br><br>In short, your system could be managed by a simple combination of AF, Outlook as a scheduler (as well as email manager) and OneNote or alternative project management solution.  All are complementary and all can be managed from your AF lists.<br><br>What I would suggest, now that Jan 31 is out of the way, that you create a task to "think about new system".  Don't rush into anything - one of the benefits of AF is that it somehow provides additional and more focused thinking time - use that to identify what it is that is important to YOU in any new system.<br></div>

<div class="content">@Mike RE 43 folders -- I do something similar, but:<br><br>(1) Instead of color coding, I just write something in the upper right corner:  +1w means repeat after 1 week.  +3m means repeat after 3 months.   Etc.  This is very simple, and very flexible.<br><br>(2) I use file-folder sized accordion envelopes, so it can accommodate more than just reminders.  If I have a magazine I want to read, but don't want to deal with it right now, just throw it in next month's folder.  If I have a bill that must be paid in 5 months, just throw it in that folder.  If my car needs a tire rotation in 3 months, I just throw the tire-rotation record book in that folder.<br><br>My AF list has repeated occurrences of "Check tickler file", which refers to these 43 folders.  And whenever I pull an item from those folders, the first thing I do with it is add it to the AF list...<br><br>Anyway, just some ideas... :-)</div>
