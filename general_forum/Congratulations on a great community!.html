<div class="content">Hello everyone!<br><br>First let me say that I have been a regular reader here for the past few months but it's the first time I actually posted anything.<br><br>I wanted to comment on the status of this community which is one of the best I have seen around the net. People here can actually give their opinion and be respected while receiving constructive criticism and encouragement.<br><br>I thought this had to be pointed out and that you all deserve a real good pat on the back!<br>Cheers!</div>
