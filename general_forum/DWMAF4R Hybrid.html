<div class="content">So, Mark's mentioning of the final version's influences got me thinking: What if you took DWM's dismissal process and added this aspect of AF4R to it.<br><br>Recurring tasks are written on separate pages that have a dismissal policy of 1 day. That means you must work on recurrent tasks at least once per day or they are dismissed. Or more aggressively, you must *complete* them everyday or they are dismissed.<br><br>A similar technique could be used for aggressively approaching incomplete tasks. An incomplete task must be worked on every day or it will be dismissed by falling over the waterfall.</div>

<div class="content">Ryan:<br><br>In order to make this a useful idea you will have to find a different basis for dismissal than the day. The trouble with work days is that they tend to be very variable in the smount of discretionary time available. Over a period of 7 days as in DWM this will average out, but that won't be the case with with next day dismissal.<br><br>One day it will be easy to work on all your recurring and unfinished tasks, the next impossible. You are then going to end up either dismissing most of your recurrent and incomplete tasks or ignoring the rule. Either way the force of the idea is lost.</div>

<div class="content">I just wanted to share my current system - a hybrid of DWM and AF4R in a digital implementation (Remember the Milk).  I use 3 lists: New, Recurring, and Unfinished. I circulate each list until nothing stands out and move on to the next one.  For New/Recurring, I use due dates of one month.  For Unfinished, I use a due date of 7 days.  A task is deleted when it goes past its due date.<br><br>re projects: I keep a list of active projects, but they aren't part of my time management system.  I have a task 'review projects list' where I ensure all my active projects have at least one task in one of my 3 lists.  When I finish a project task, I choose another one and add it to 'new'.  I keep my project tasks in RTM and all my project notes/logs in Evernote.<br><br>This system is working great for me.  I feel like I'm moving the right things forward and I always have a view of what's on my plate (unfinished).<br><br>A disclaimer - I've been using Mark's system since AF1.  I think the past few years has really helped in training my mind in choosing tasks that 'stand out'.  I don't know if this system would work as well for a newcomer to the AF world.<br><br>If anyone is interested I would be happy to share more details of my implementation in RTM.</div>

<div class="content">It strikes me that you retain the single-place-of-capture, frequent cycling, and the "stand out" features of AF1, with the dismissal rules, overall organization, and underlying medium (RTM) all adapted to fit your particular needs.<br><br>That's pretty much what I did with AutoDIT, too.<br><br>And that's pretty much what Gerry always seems to fall back to:  capture everything in one notebook; cycle through it; do what stands out.  The rest is an optimization exercise - which might or might not be worth the effort.</div>

<div class="content">Sabrina:<br><br>I've heard of RTM (I think I came across it several years ago when I was dabbling with GTD) and tried others, however on the strength of your post and having had a look at RTM's site, I think I might give RTM a trial along the lines you describe.<br><br>What smartphone or other device do you sync RTM with your computer?  Are you using the Pro version?<br><br>If you like, you can email rhj1947ATgmail.com with your answers and other details.</div>
