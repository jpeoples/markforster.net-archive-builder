<div class="content">I know AF is intented to use in our discretionary time but I have difficulty to trace a line between my hobbies, time with family, the things I have to do like housework, and the projects I really want to do(may be the most important for me).<br>Should I put everything in AF or should I use AF just for a part of these things with a time blocking methodology to work on AF lists only in yhese blocks and outside I would be free to do what I want with my hobbies for example.<br>I guess I should put everything in AF but I feel like it is not always good for creative work since I obey to moods and inspirarions(it may be a bad thing?)</div>

<div class="content">isd,<br>recently i started a pretty similar post (What do you put on your list?). I also struggle with the question which things should go on the list. I think, that NOT putting everything on the list  (except emergency stuff) will corrupt AFs' "flow". On the other hand I resist to put common stuff on the list or work 24h of the list. <br><br>Since GTD times I always found the term "three-fold nature of work" (as DA puts it) usfull. Which also applies with AF. <br>a/ Do work as it shows up (without putting it on the list, but put follow-ups on the list)<br>b/ process predefinded stuff (from your list)<br>c/ process incoming stuff (inbox - putting on it on your list or do it immediately)<br><br>But as mentioned, the balance between a/ b/ c/ will impact AF and possibly corrupt it's advantages.<br><br>- Jens</div>

<div class="content">My problem is that I prefer doing "work" as it shows up, I mean as I feel it necessary, otherwise I procrastinate. So writing it makes me forget it and most of the time helps in fact doing something else I better feel doing. So I end not using the system unless I feel the need to check my list to verify if I have forgot something. So I just always do things as I feel and check them off the list afterwards if they happened to be written.<br>It is my tendancy that I try to fight but I would prefer to find a system that fits it.<br>Not sure if I explained well.</div>

<div class="content">You can go either way. I'm not sure you explained yourself well enough to give a great answer, but I'm sure an answer can be found with SuperFocus. Try this:<br><br>Have some dedicated times when you don't follow the list, and times (more than now) when you DO follow it.  Get the habit of choosing among the options presented. This still allows freedom to choose what's suits you for now,and control over how long you work each item.<br>If you want to do something other than what is listed, aim to turn the page (following thre rules) or write it in as urgent. Only for these "urgent" items, try working a while, rewrite as unfinshed, do a bit of other stuff, turn the page, and resume your chosen activity. <br><br>Doing this balances what you want to do now with all the stuff you should get to eventually. You retain creative control, same as a painter who chooses to use only pastels is still in artistic control.</div>

<div class="content">isd:<br><br>I use the list for anything I consider NOT play or food. That includes work, school (when I was in it), personal tasks/errands (put keyboard on ebay, etc.). <br><br>So for yours, I would put homework, projects, housework on the list. Maybe hobbies. <br><br>Hobbies is your call, if you love your hobbies and use that as a way to relax from your other work, then no need to have it on the list (again, my opinion). But if there is any psychological resistance to certain hobby tasks, or some tasks get stuck undone for a while, then you can use the list to get them done. I put most of my hobbies on the list as they often have little tasks that I somehow resist for some reason and am thus frustrated that the big picture is not moving forward.</div>

<div class="content">As I said on another thread: "It's up to you what you put on your list". <br><br>It may take some experimentation to find what is the best balance for you. Remember the list is there to help you get work done, not to get in your way.</div>

<div class="content">Mark: that last sentence in your 18:29 post seems familiar, I think you've quoted it before.<br><br>That's ok, because it's a good reminder as each of us strive to find our own 'perfect' system.  <br><br>What works for each of us is important, however I think some of us like to notify the forum of our latest tweak to have the jury consider its verdict.  It's the 'do it, try it, fix it' which keeps me keep coming back to the forum.<br><br>Like Alan B and others, I am a procrastinator and I may even have A2D2, so I have to beware of spending too much time tweaking the system and not getting tasks done.<br><br>As a one-man show, I have to do all my own admin and other things taken for granted by corporate types (been there, done that).  To keep myself more focused on the work that brings in the money, I am trying out my 'Work' list will contain ONLY those tasks which concern my current projects.<br><br>All the tasks associated with admin, maintaining my IT infrastructure, dealing with future assignment prospects etc are no longer on the 'Work' list.<br><br>These are now appearing on my 'Personal' list.  I don't want to have three lists, so I'm trying to think of another label for the list with both personal and non-current work tasks.<br><br>But I sometimes do insert a few tasks from the non-Work list into the Work list because I know I can fit it in here and there, and use the better Internet connection at the assignment office.<br><br>Any ideas for the label for the 'Non-Work' list, other than that?</div>

<div class="content">Thank you everyone for your help. I think I begin to get it.<br>I was putting on the list things I would naturally do eent if It was not written on the list so the list would get in my way. I will try to write only things I may forget, then use this "rule" as a startpoint</div>
