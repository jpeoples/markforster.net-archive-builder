<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-05-1 23:34</div>
<div class="content">I visit this forum from time to time and truly enjoy reading the views, perspectives and information given. There really are some wonderful regular contributors here! But I rarely post. I guess I could be called a 95% lurker-5% participant. <br><br>However, in recent months, I would visit this forum and feel this rather strange vibe here. I don’t need to go any further into the “He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named” issue, enough of that! Except to say, I feel a bit like the Munchkins did after the Wicked Witch met her demise in Oz…and how it is now “safe” to come out from hiding/lurking. <br><br>And I wonder if there are others such as me…not a Dorothy or a Tin Man or Courageous Lion or Noble Straw Man (how I envision the “regulars”), but just a curious Munchkin.<br><br>Munchkins have time management issues, too. <br><br>And herein lies the real purpose of this post. I wonder if there are others, as myself, who have “on-topic-to-this-forum” issues that they would perhaps like to throw out to this wonderful, intelligent cast of regulars for input. <br><br>Some ideas might be (and all issues of mine, btw):<br>* Techniques for staying focused when you get off-track. Ideas for getting back on? For  not getting off in the first place?<br><br>* Time Bursts—love the idea. Could someone explain them in more detail?<br><br>* Reviewing ones bigger goals against how we actually spend our day. Meaning, ways to keep those two in alignment. Macro vs. Micro issue perhaps?<br><br>And of course there are others. Just wanted to suggest some ideas for topics/threads. I realize that these have been discussed here before, but thought it might be nice to reintroduce some of them in an "on-topic" way since, let’s face it, they do still exist in real time, well, at least in my world.<br><br>With a sigh of relief~<br>Beth<br><br>P.S. I purposely didn’t list AF-DWM topics since they are extensively covered and easily searched for.</div>

<div class="content">Ding dong the witch is dead!<br><br>Wow Beth, that's a lot of things to discuss!  If you started one thread for each of those, you'd become an honorary regular :-)  Fact is, none of us are experts on this stuff.  We just like to share and learn together.  I'm sure you or any Munchkin could contribute as much as I do if you are inclined.  In fact, please do!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Beth,<br><br>>>>  * Reviewing ones bigger goals against how we actually spend our day. Meaning, ways to keep those two in alignment. Macro vs. Micro issue perhaps?  <<<<br><br>I'm not sure what you want here, maybe if you gave some examples?  The only thing I have found that works for me is to have my goals worked out, from longest term to shortest ... down to projects and tasks.  I review those weekly and ensure that there are some tasks for my biggest goals on my weekly list.  I've never found a better way.<br><br>As to goals themselves, I refer anyone to Alan Lakein's book as the best one to develop ones list of goals.</div>

<div class="content">Sorry Beth, not to hijack this thread or anything, but David: I would just like to warmly welcome you back. I identified with many of your posts about the troubles you had choosing the right system amongst Mark's array.<br><br>Beth: I cloak and decloak every now and then, so in a way I'm like you too. It may feel like there are sharks in the waters at times, but I do like to dip my toe in every now and then when, er, well, it stands out!</div>

<div class="content">Beth, David,<br><br>Welcome back!<br><br>I'm sorry that I missed the chance to comment on the hatchet job someone (Mel?) did on Norman, but that topic is now closed. The chance to hear from old friends is certainly some compensation.</div>

<div class="content">JD - you took the words out of my mouth (only put them more eloquently than I could).<br><br>Another topic I struggle with is dealing with projects. When I have several on the go at once, I can't seem to manage them properly, and how best to incorporate all the others I want to do as well. Plus the benefits/drawbacks of putting tasks into specific timeslots on the calendar. Also I'd be interested in knowing how many people do a weekly/monthly review, as that's one of the things which AF does not include.</div>

<div class="content">How nice to feel "safe enough" to decloak, as JD says. The feeling is actually quite tangible. Ding, Dong, indeed :~)<br><br>Mike: I will start a thread on the topic of aligning Life Goals with one's day-to-day tasks after I haven given a bit more thought to the real issue that lurks below the surface issue, if that makes sense. Your suggestions here are simple and applicable, so thanks for that. I don't know of the author you mention. More on that in the "official" thread.<br><br>Linda: I agree with you about the management of projects being tricky. Another thread perhaps?<br><br>~Beth</div>

<div class="content">Will,<br><br>I'm a bit puzzled by you lately.  Of all on this forum, I've had the highest opinion of you ... maybe it is your cute cat?<br><br>>>>  I'm sorry that I missed the chance to comment on the hatchet job someone (Mel?) did on Norman, but that topic is now closed. <<<<br><br>In one sentence you manage to:<br><br>- Characterize the villain as the victim and the one who pointed out the villainy as the one doing evil,<br><br>- Note that the topic was closed<br><br>- Re open it here, as a hijack to Beth's question rather than as its own new thread<br><br>- Accuse Mel of being a new villain<br><br>That is a pretty impressive accomplishment.<br><br><<< The chance to hear from old friends is certainly some compensation.  <<<<br><br>Compensation for what?  Having to read Beth's post?  Not getting to take a whack at Mel in a previous post?<br><br>I confess to being a bit disappointed.  I expected better of the owner of a beautiful calico queen.  I will tell you that Louise is scandalized!</div>

You will usually find someone in your corner if you are being treated harshly.<br><br>Yes, feel free to start a new thruead on goals.  I the mean time, a search on his name will reveal quite a few posts about him.  He has been around for quite a while.  You can get his book here:<br><br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Control-Your-Time-Life-Signet/dp/0451167724/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1272788633&sr=1-1" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Control-Your-Time-Life-Signet/dp/0451167724/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1272788633&sr=1-1</a><br><br>You can find used copies for as little as $0.01 plus shipping which puts it at about $4.00.  Or you can hit your local used book store and most certainly find a beat up copy there for whatever they feel like charging ;-)<br><br>There is also a thread going on about Tony Robbins.  He has some goals and values work in his books and tapes.  I still think, however, that the book I mentioned is the best as it is very prescriptive with exercises that will take you a couple of weeks if you do them with the effort they deserve.  At the end of the process you will know WHERE you are going and WHY.  You might or might not like his approach to time management (I do) and he also has a number of tips on overcoming procrastination and other problems you might run into.  Big "bang for the buck".</div>

I'm not sure I understand why you are bothered by any of that.  If yo stick your toe in the water and something chomps it, reach in and grab whatever it is, snatch it out, run a stick through it and stick it on the fire for dinner!  Sticks and stones ... remember?</div>

<div class="content">Linda,<br><br>The only way I've been able to manage projects IS by doing weekly reviews.  For me, that is the whole point of doing weekly reviews.  Keep your projects together in separate folders (paper or electronic).  Look at them at least weekly.  Pick tasks you will do for each for that week.  Assign a time block when you will do them, then do them.  Go back to the folder for additional tasks as needed during the week.  Review and reevaluate again next week.  Lather, rinse, repeat.</div>

<div class="content">Projects: Used to do it the way Mike describes it, religiously so during my GTD days. But I used to miss those review dates, and as time wore on, I felt like I was letting myself down.<br><br>Now I am happy enough to allow them to sit as part of an external list, or to write the next steps of a project in the AF list directly. On the list, the task may get "project X" appended to them, but more often than not, it doesn't matter which project it is attached to. Just doing it when it stands out means that you are working on a project when it is most important for you.</div>

<div class="content">Mike <br><The only way I've been able to manage projects IS by doing weekly reviews.> Yes, I have used weekly reviews, picking out tasks and scattering them through the week, but the ones that fall into the 'important but not urgent' ones often get bypassed when other stuff comes up. I do try to schedule time for such tasks occasionally but that's just an invitation to procrastinate, for me, and I'm better off just with a will-do list.<br><br>Mark<br>I'm using DIT at the moment and trying to progress projects by doing a little every day on them, recycling them for round for tomorrow. However, it's impossible to juggle too many of them at once like that or there's no feeling of progression.</div>

<div class="content">One thing that works for me -- I learned it from Neil Fiore's great book "The Now Habit" -- is to set a limit on how much time I will spend on an unpleasant task over the course of a  single day.<br>For example -- today -- i have a ton of reading to do for a course teach at a university.  It is a beautiful spring day  and I have NO desire to do this reading (which is one reason I'm on this forum at 10:07 a.m.).   However, I am going to say to myself the following:  "You will do SPEND NO MORE THAN FIVE HOURS reading today." That's the limit.  I will time myself -- and make sure I don't go beyond that limit  And that leaves me with nine or ten hours to do other things. I usually only use this technique at times when I have a huge amount of work and a great deal of resistance about doing it. <br>It's usually effective for me and others may find it useful as well.</div>

<div class="content">Beth L and  Linda :  Gerry of simpletimemanagement.blogspot.com has a neat way of organizing and acting on projects.
