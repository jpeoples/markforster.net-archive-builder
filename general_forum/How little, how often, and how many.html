Then you repeat doing a little of each.<br><br>But it's often the case that you can do bigger tasks more effectively by concentrating on them for 30min or maybe even a few hours.  And smaller tasks are more effectively done in 10 minute bits than in 30 second bits.<br><br>I'm thinking the most effective strategy is to daily do little bits on a good number of things, and lots on a few things.  I think it's less effective to pick up those few things lots of times, doing only a little bit each time.<br><br>But I'm really not sure.</div>

<div class="content">Little and often applies in two ways in SuperFocus and 3T:<br><br>1) Medium to large sized tasks can be worked at in several goes over a short period in Column 2.<br><br>2) If these tasks are part of a larger whole another task from the whole can be entered at the end of the list.<br><br>For example, reading "War and Peace"<br><br>"Read Chapter 1" takes several goes, which are controlled in column 2.<br><br>When that is finished, the next task is "Read Chapter 2" which is entered at the end of the list.<br><br>So the whole book is read little and often.<br><br>Small tasks, e.g. "Select which book to read next" etc can be done in one go.</div>

<div class="content">Hours worked per week = number projects x sessions per project x time per session.<br><br>If one number on the right goes up, another has to go down. There's no way around it, unless you change the number of hours in a week.<br><br>So, yes, if you have an hour a day for projects you could do 5 minutes on 12 projects every day, if 5 minutes were effective. You could also do a full hour once a week on 5 projects, or a full hour all 5 days on one project.<br><br>For projects, my Goldilocks zone is 30 minutes per project, at least every other day. I have 90 minutes a day, so that's a whopping 6 projects. 5 is more realistic. When a system is filled to capacity, it can't react to changes. If nothing happens to the extra time, I can do an extra session or relax. (Or I can fool myself into thinking I can handle an extra project and watch them all suffer.)<br><br>Less than 30 minutes and I don't get into the project. The first 5 minutes are usually the least productive and messiest. 30 usually finishes a defined chunk. Also, if the sessions are too short I spend too much time moving between them, putting away one file and getting out the next.<br><br>If I miss more than a day I get out of the habit. The light at the end of the tunnel gets dimmer and seems to recede. Also, the file and equipment gets buried. Twice in a row is often good, but it can leave me feeling so virtuous that I skip, not just one day, but several. See previous comment about receding light.</div>

<div class="content">Sounds like you do exactly the same amount on each project.  If the amounts vary, the equation doesn't work so simple.  But I think the results may be better: More on X and Y, and less on everythnig else (of those you do keep up with) seems to be the trick.  I think.</div>

<div class="content">My largest group of projects work well with that size chunk, but it's fuzzy. If I'm on a roll I do more, if I can't get into it I move on.<br><br>Little-and-often taken too far is multi-tasking. It works just enough to fool us into thinking it will work all the time.<br><br>Also, the temptation with little-and-often is to say, "I can get everything done by slicing the hour into minuscule pieces." There's a practical lower limit to little.<br><br>I think I'm reacting to a leadership piece I just heard. Checking on each employee every hour gets in their way and disrupts their work.</div>

<div class="content">In the term "little and often", the word "little" is relative. What it means is working at something regularly rather than in one huge effort (usually at the last minute). <br><br>The classic example is piano practice when you have a weekly lesson. The teacher will encourage you to practice your exercises for a relatively short time every day, rather than have a huge session the night before the lesson. In this case "relatively short" probably means half-an-hour daily, rather than two to three hours in a panic.<br><br>In the case of a concert pianist "relatively short" would probably be more like four hours.<br><br>On the other hand clearing your email little and often might only take ten minutes.</div>
