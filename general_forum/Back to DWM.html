<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2011-01-14 13:10</div>
<div class="content">After a couple of months (has it been that long?  I guess so...) with AF4R, I've decided to go back to DWM.  The reason for this is purely a "feature" of my personality: I'm a starter, but not a finisher.  I have GREAT ideas, I start implementing them and... Well, I can't count the number of half-finished craft projects that are upstairs in my sewing room. It's simply miraculous that my "unfinished" section only had 18 items on it when I shifted everything back to DWM this morning.  I need the time pressure of the dated dismissal to keep me moving on all the things I start, or force me to really take a hard look at whether I really ought to be spending my time on that particular idea. I also never REALLY adjusted to not being able to dump anything that needs to be started in the next 30 days on page M and then know that it would stay active in my subconscious.</div>

<div class="content">Were you satisfied with DWM before?</div>

<div class="content">Extremely.  It's so intuitive for me to use that it recedes into the background in a way that none of the others have.  At one point I was cleaning up my hard drive and found the step-by-step DWM demo I did last year and paged through it quickly, thinking to myself the whole time, "This is a really elegant system, why am I not using it anymore?"  And then I realized... I am!  It just doesn't even feel like a system to me.</div>

<div class="content">Sarah,<br><br>I've been doing DWM.xls since it came out. I never stopped. I haven't even been tempted by Mark's more recent systems.<br><br>A good system has to harmonize with at least two things: the personality of the user and the pace of the work that the user does. For me, DWM fits the bill.<br><br>Does that mean I no longer procrastinate? No! But DWM.xls keeps me a lot more focused than anything else ever did.<br><br>I am glad to hear that there are still other DWM devotees.</div>

<div class="content">"I no longer procrastinate" definitely doesn't describe me.  But the system still works, even if I ignore it for a week.  New stuff got recorded, and I quickly find and do whatever is pressing.</div>

<div class="content">Sarah, thanks for testing AF4R for us DWM devotees. Now, I'm even less tempted to go try AF4R and lose precious time & hair.<br><br>I did recently move from DWM.xls to DWM on Toodledo just to freshen things. Now I can easily do DWM on basically the same list in different modes: (1) paper A7 booklet, (2) mobile via www.toodledo.com/slim/ , (3) portable via iPad toodledo client and (4) full fledged www.toodledo.com on my desktop/notebook. <br><br>Any other DWM devotees here on Toodledo? ;-)</div>

I like the modes that you have identified as available.  If not would you be willing to write a how to post based on your implementation?</div>

<div class="content">I'm a Toodledo user, actually (for DWM and also when I was trying AF4R).  There are a couple of descriptions of Toodledo DWM implementations here: <br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1351338" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1351338</a><br><br>And some discussion in a much larger thread about going digital starting about here:<br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1002402#post1002819" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1002402#post1002819</a><br><br>My basic implementation is to have two folders: active & dismissed. New tasks default to active with a due date one month in the future.  I sort by due date and when I work on something I check it off if completed and clone it and reset the due date on the cloned task for one week in the future.  Both the web and iPad implementations of Toodledo make this very easy - there's a shortcut for both one month (although you can create defaults for new tasks in the iPad version) and one week due dates.  When I dismiss a task I just change it's folder so I can review it later.</div>

<div class="content">There is a way to combine AF4R with the time-based dismissal process of DWM: Every morning I write the current date on the right hand side of the first unused line in each section. Thus for each task I know when it was created/rewritten. The time base-dismissal rule (parallel to the AF$ dismissal rule) is as follows:<br>BACKLOG/NEW: one month<br>PROJECTS: two weeks<br>RECURRING: one week<br>UNFINISHES: one week<br>What do you think?</div>

<div class="content">I practice this informally on the Unfinished page.  The rest I wouldn't observe, but then I never really liked DWM.  I can tell you though many projects and many recurring items go much slower than 1 or 2 weeks, so that time scale won't work.</div>

<div class="content">Christian, I can see that working; I just prefer not to keep track of two dismissal methods.  :^)</div>

<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>Maybe it's because of how DWM2 is, but I got bogged down by the sheer number of active tasks.  How did you guys cope?<br><br>God bless!</div>

<div class="content">nuntym, if anything I was getting bogged down with active tasks in AF4R, because once something migrated into unfinished there was no outside pressure to get things off the list.  With DWM (though I suppose my Toodledo version of DWM is more like DWM2 since there are no pages to deal with) I haven't had any such problems.  As I said at the top, though, this is at least in part due to my "starter" personality.  I NEED that outside pressure to keep things moving along or force me to make decisions about them.</div>

<div class="content">Me too Sarah.  That's why I've tracking days on the active list.  Force me to move everything forward or dismiss stuff or at least be aware of how what I'm neglecting to finish.</div>
