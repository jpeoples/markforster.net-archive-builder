<div class="content">Hi, I'm very curious on how you organize the folders on your computer to be more productive.<br><br>Currently I'm using a 4 folders system:<br>- Inbox - keeps all my downloads and temporary files (emptied weekly)<br>- Current Projects - contains the directories holding all the data for my active projects (one directory / project)<br>- Incubate - has all the projects that are On Hold<br>- Archive - all other info:<br>* personal<br>* business<br>* financial<br>* health (fitness, food, medical)<br>* software (backups, how to do X using program Y notes)<br>* references / scanned files (diplomas, ids, other stuff)<br><br>I'd like to know of other systems you use so that I may learn from your wisdom and improve upon my system.</div>

<div class="content">I have to admit that I don't make any attempt to organise my folders at all. I keep all documents in Documents, keeping the sort function on date order so I can quickly find what I'm working on and rely on Google Desktop to find old stuff if necessary. Occasionally I will take a file I'm using a lot and put it on the Desktop so I can get at it immediately - that is usually only for a pdf or other long document which will take some time to read, or image files which need some sort of processing.<br><br>As far as email is concerned I use NEO email organiser, which again requires no conscious organising.<br><br>For photos I keep my files in dated folders - one per day - which my camera does automatically.</div>

<div class="content">For work only:<br>- autofocus in OneNote, including embedded documents and links to projects<br>- Projects - plans in ON. Docs arranged by subject<br>- customers<br>- software<br>* business, financial records<br><br>At home I don't even use a computer. I have financial records, an alphabetical file box, and project books.</div>

<div class="content">Oh I have quite elaborate file structures in outlook and on my laptop. My system probably wouldn't work for you as my business is probably quite different. I have a top level of Business, Customers, Personal and everything else drops in beneath.<br><br>I've found it invaluable to keep files from work as I have on several occasions had reason to check back on files - sometimes two years after a project has been 'completed'.</div>
