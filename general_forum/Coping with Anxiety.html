<div class="content">Dear all,<br><br>could you please advise your methods of coping with anxiety?<br><br>I have symptoms which can be best described by "General Anxiety Disorder" definiton. When I'm almost "free" of anxiety I'm very productive using AF4 and DIT tools (coupled with project management tools from Wishcraft book).<br>But when anxiety comes, I'm becoming very unproductive/inefficient.<br><br>Could you please advise books/URLs which help you to cope with anxiety. I can recommend Wishcraft (which can be downloaded from www.wishcraft.com), "10 steps to self-discipline" and "relaxation response". <br>Any tips/suggestions will be much appreciated also!<br>Cognitive behaivor therapy and NLP do not work for me or I don't understand how to use it correctly.</div>

<div class="content">Veslavvv - you're in good company. Anxiety (read: suffering) is one of the few universal experiences that bind us all. Some employ quick fix solutions hoping to reduce symptoms and keep doing the same ol, same ol. Other ride the anxiety wave towards self-exploration and growth. As a therapist, I've yet to meet an individual, couple or family who experience meaningless anxiety. As such, I'm not a huge fan of (long-term) medication and/or CBT therapies. <br><br>Beyond finding a good therapist, one of the best books (both theoretically and practically)  I've read is: <br><br>Finding Serenity in the Age of Anxiety:<br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Finding-Serenity-Anxiety-Robert-Gerzon/dp/055337978X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1260455846&sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Finding-Serenity-Anxiety-Robert-Gerzon/dp/055337978X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1260455846&sr=8-1</a><br><br>Good luck!</div>

<div class="content">Hi, I've found Neil Fiore to be an invaluable resource.  His presentation is straightforward and he cuts to the root of the problem and has practical suggestions that seem to help.<br><br>First, I would recommend The Now Habit:<br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Now-Habit-Overcoming-Procrastination-Guilt-Free/dp/1585425524/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1260523197&sr=1-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Now-Habit-Overcoming-Procrastination-Guilt-Free/dp/1585425524/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1260523197&sr=1-1</a><br><br>Second, I would recommend Conquering Test Anxiety, which is helpful in thinking about hard deadlines and large projects, since a Test and  a Project can be treated similarly with ramp-up to a final day:<br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Conquering-Test-Anxiety-Neil-Fiore/dp/0446385387/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1260523227&sr=1-8" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Conquering-Test-Anxiety-Neil-Fiore/dp/0446385387/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1260523227&sr=1-8</a><br><br>Finally, for a wider scope about life generally, Your Strongest Self is pretty good.  All of these materials are available on audio as well as in print, so if you don't have the time to sit and read you can listen in your car or on a jog.   <br><br>Good Luck!</div>

<div class="content">It seems to me anxiety may be a bit of a catch-all term, there should be as many words for anxiety as the Eskimos have for snow :)<br><br>For example it could be fear of missing something that matters, an important appointment or deadline.<br><br>Or maybe it's a general dissatisfaction that time is not being used as well as it could or should be.<br><br>I suspect a lot of anxiety stems from from a perceived inability to deal with uncertainty.</div>

<div class="content">Hey Pete,<br><br>The way he used the term was very specific.  Generalized Anxiety Disorder is not anxiety about anything in particular, that is why it is called that.</div>

<div class="content">"I suspect a lot of anxiety stems from from a perceived inability to deal with uncertainty."<br><br>I would agree. <br><br>I'd also take all DSM categories i.e. GAD with a grain of a salt.</div>

<div class="content">'The way he used the term was very specific. Generalized Anxiety Disorder is not anxiety about anything in particular, that is why it is called that.'<br><br>I hear you, but it's not clear that the OP is anxious /despite/ using AF4 and project management tools.<br><br>Also it's quite possible that anxiety has more than one root causes, and so a complete cure/solution must be holistic.<br><br>(Acute anxiety/panic about absolutely nothing may be a symptom of clinical depression AFAIK, but it sounds like that's not the case for the OP.)</div>

<div class="content">Hey Pete,<br><br>I guess I don't consider myself competent to diagnose someone long distance, from an email.  I can only take him at his word that he has given it some thought, found no reason for his anxiety, and thus labels it "generalized".  Of course there are reasons for everything, but with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, the anxiety is rooted in something other than what it is temporaly associated with.  IOW, if you are anxious about a plane ride when one is coming up, and are not anxious at other times, then there is a logical connection and I would not call it generalized.  If you are anxious all the time, and one of those times is when you are on a plane, I would not think the plane ride has anything at all to do with it.<br><br>As to the question of his being right or wrong in how he diagnoses himself ... who knows?  But he is in a better position to know than we are, I'd suppose.</div>

<div class="content">OK OK I'm getting there...<br><br>Suppose the OP is doing what they can in terms of time and project management, but /still/ feels generalised anxiety...<br><br>What seems to work for me is to get *moving* on *something* so I'm not making myself anxious dwelling on things.<br><br>Seems if my subconscious is trying to solve or come to terms with a problem or situation, rather than fight it by constantly and consciously thinking about it, it's better to occupy myself with other things.<br><br>That said it may not work for other people or even be seriously counterproductive in some situations, but it seems to work well for me in  short term situations.</div>

<div class="content">Pete,<br><br>You might not have an appreciation of what GAD is.  It is being in a state of anxiety (from a low level to near panic) almost EVERY waking hour ... and no matter what you do or how you do it ... it makes not the slightest difference.  You can't take a vacation and get away from it.  Working harder does not help.  Working a new system does not.  It is just ALWAYS there.  It feels as if the universe itself is a threat to your life and/or well-being in some undefined way.  You can't say what you are afraid of.  You can't think why you feel anxious.  You just DO.<br><br>This really is vastly different from feeling as if you are missing a deadline or forgetting an appointment.  Those can be identified and dealt with.  Imagine that you are feeling anxious over a project and someone gave you a large sum of money so you could either hire someone to do everything for you or you could retire to the Bahamas.  You'd feel much better ... yes?  With GAD it would make no difference at all.  Lying there in the sun on the beach would leave you feeling just as anxious.</div>

<div class="content">A huge factor in GAD that hasn't even been mentioned is the physiological. Individuals with GAD suffer from extensive, debilitating physical symptoms. Yes, those physical symptoms may be a response to mental angst, but the opposite path is just as likely. <br><br>I had a CT-scan as a teen and during it found that I was itching and unable to breathe. Being a psych student even then and knowing the contraption's rep for causing anxiety, I determined to relax and breathe as deeply as possible. This despite the fact that I didn't "feel" anxious. I discovered when it was over that I was experiencing an anaphylactoid reaction. My BP had bottomed out, my face was swollen beyond recognition, and my body was covered with giant hives. I was in the hospital for a week recovering. It was a case of misattribution for sure. :-)<br><br>GAD patients were my specialty in grad school. Physical symptoms must be managed before any psychological work can be effective imo. That can be done with meds or preferably with lots of exercise and to a lesser extent relaxation training. That being said, spiritual growth has been the most effective means of managing anxiety for me personally and professionally.</div>

<div class="content">"lesser extent relaxation training."<br><br>Mel - I agree with your placement of the above. MSBR literature promises all sorts of things, but (in my professional and personal experience) delivers little of it. Still, I try and meditate on a regular basis. I've learned to appreciate meditation for the moment I'm meditating vs what may happen later. To date, I'm still a little neurotic a la Woody Allen. And last I checked, almost all of my MSBR classmates have either:<br><br>* stopped meditating <br>* continue to do so but have not experienced significant reductions in anxiety</div>

<div class="content">Thanks to all for helpful suggestions.<br><br>It seems that anxiety is little bit different for all of us. I cannot describe mine better than it has been done at: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_anxiety_disorder" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_anxiety_disorder</a><br><br>I've found this brief book review very helpful <a href="http://counselling.anu.edu.au/sites/default/files/The_10_Best_Ever_Anxiety_Management_Techniques-1.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://counselling.anu.edu.au/sites/default/files/The_10_Best_Ever_Anxiety_Management_Techniques-1.pdf</a> It contains different methods - maybe one of them or combination would work for you.<br><br>But even more helpful I've found usage of herbals (valeriana and motherwort). And no coffeine usage during usage of pills. Of course, it's temporary solution, but it works for me.<br><br>And plus these three daily activities:<br><br>1) Walking - 30 minutes.<br>2) Journaling - 10-15 preferrably by hand<br>3) Meditation - 10-15 minutes.</div>

<div class="content">Chris, thanks for the good humor! Avrum, I wasn't referencing meditation, though I know many who swear by it. For me, it's a matter of who's in charge. If it's me, I have reason to be anxious.</div>

<div class="content">Veslaav, great suggestion you gave yourself on journaling. LOL Even if it's not formal journaling, simply recording every matter of concern and then taking one more step and writing what you will do about each helps me tremendously.</div>
