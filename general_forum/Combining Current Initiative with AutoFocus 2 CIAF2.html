<div class="content">People experimenting with time management techniques means it is time for me to do my own! <br><br>Reverse FVP was a bust for me because of how clunky it was with urgent tasks, and it felt too complicated.  It showed me, however, how great of an idea it was to have one or more "current initiatives" to keep my focus on the important stuff throughout the day.<br><br>So, I thought, why not simplify Reverse FVP by removing all preselection except for the current initiative? Of course, by doing that, the new system becomes a lot like AF2, which is why, after refining the rules, I call it CIAF2.<br><br>1.  Select a "current initiative" from anywhere in the list, cross it out, and re-enter it at the end of the list with a special mark like an asterisk or a cross.<br>2.  Scan from the end of your list going up, looking for a task that "stands out". This can include the "current initiative".  Mark it with a dot.<br>3.  If the task that "stood out" was not the current initiative, do it in whole or in part, then cross it out. Re-enter the task at the end of the list if necessary.  Go back to step 2.<br>4.  If the current initiative was the task that "stood out", and you have done some work on it but not finished for the day, cross it out and rewrite it with the special mark at the end of the list, then again go back to step 2.<br>5.  Once the "current initiative" is done for the day, cross it out and, if needed, re-enter at the end of the list without the special mark.  Go back to step 1.<br><br>Since it would give the user a context for selecting a task, I predict that the current initiative will overcome the major weakness of AF2, which is the phenomenon of "playing catch-up": as the list becomes longer, it becomes harder to choose a task as you may have to scan many pages before a task could be selected.  Meanwhile, AF2's strengths in urgent tasks and in encouraging "little and often" (arguably the strongest among Mark Forster's systems) will be kept intact.<br><br>Anyways I will report on CIAF2 for the coming days in this thread, and of course anybody who wants to try this is welcome to do so.</div>

<div class="content">Reporting on my 3rd day of use of CIAF2:<br><br>Wow, I didn't realize how much I missed "standing out"! Since there is minimal preselection before picking a task, I am finding this system to be more nimble than even vanilla FVP. And compared to both FVP and rFVP I seem to feel more free in picking tasks. <br><br>At the same time, I sense that I am also more focused as I choose tasks that are in context with the current initiative.</div>

<div class="content">Another report:<br><br>Traditionally, lists are used to relieve distractions: if you are being distracted by thoughts of other tasks to do later, just write them in a list and get back to them later.  Because of how the other AF's were, this way of relieving distraction was not so good since it will take some time before you can get back to them.  Not so with CIAF (and maybe AF2 back in the days) because you always start from the end of the list. I am getting confident of how CIAF is reminding me of ideas I thought of just minutes ago, and thus has been very good in relieving distractions.</div>

<div class="content">Hi nuntym<br><br>As a longtime fan of AF2 and an occasional user of AF2ND I'm curious as to how much this actually differs from AF2. Do you "have" to do the current initiative when you come to it? Or is the special marking just to draw your attention to it and make it more likely to stand out?</div>

<div class="content">Oh, and by the way: I found a way to use CIAF2 to break down a current initiative into smaller steps and then do these steps into however order you want to do them, irrespective of the order you wrote them in the list, WITHOUT losing the focus of the current initiative. I will show how I do this with examples; the plus symbol + will be used as the special current initiative symbol, and the bullet • will be used to mark the task being done.<br><br>Let us say we have a list of five tasks:<br><br>Task A<br>Task B<br>Task C<br>Task D<br>Task E<br><br>And I want to use Task C as my current initiative, so the list becomes<br><br>Task A<br>Task B<br>-c-r-o-s-s-o-u-t-<br>Task D<br>Task E<br>+Task C<br><br>I wanted though to break down Task C into smaller tasks.  Therefore, Task C "stands out", I dot it as my present task, and wrote down the subtasks of Task C, like so:<br><br>Task A<br>Task B<br>-c-r-o-s-s-o-u-t-<br>Task D<br>Task E<br>•+Task C<br>Task C1<br>Task C2<br>Task C3<br>Task C4<br>Task C5<br>Task C6<br><br>But since I did Task C I cross it out and re-write it at the end of the list like so:<br><br>Task A<br>Task B<br>-c-r-o-s-s-o-u-t-<br>Task D<br>Task E<br>-c-r-o-s-s-o-u-t-<br>Task C1<br>Task C2<br>Task C3<br>Task C4<br>Task C5<br>Task C6<br>+Task C<br><br>So let us say I added a few more tasks and worked on tasks other than Task C and its subtasks:<br><br>•Task A<br>Task B<br>-c-r-o-s-s-o-u-t-<br>Task D<br>Task E<br>-c-r-o-s-s-o-u-t-<br>Task C1<br>Task C2<br>Task C3<br>Task C4<br>Task C5<br>Task C6<br>+Task C<br>Task F<br>-c-r-o-s-s-o-u-t-<br>Task H<br>Task I<br>Task G<br><br>After doing Task A I scanned again the list, and Task C3 "stood out".  However, since I know Task C3 is a subtask of the current initiative Task C, I crossed out Task C3 and rewrote a short description of it right beside Task C, then dotted it.<br><br>-c-r-o-s-s-o-u-t-<br>Task B<br>-c-r-o-s-s-o-u-t-<br>Task D<br>Task E<br>-c-r-o-s-s-o-u-t-<br>Task C1<br>Task C2<br>-c-r-o-s-s-o-u-t-<br>Task C4<br>Task C5<br>Task C6<br>•+Task C: C3<br>Task F<br>-c-r-o-s-s-o-u-t-<br>Task H<br>Task I<br>Task G<br><br>I then do Task C3, then once done I crossed out Task C and re-wrote it in the end of the list with the special current initiative symbol beside it.<br><br>-c-r-o-s-s-o-u-t-<br>Task B<br>-c-r-o-s-s-o-u-t-<br>Task D<br>Task E<br>-c-r-o-s-s-o-u-t-<br>Task C1<br>Task C2<br>-c-r-o-s-s-o-u-t-<br>Task C4<br>Task C5<br>Task C6<br>-c-r-o-s-s-o-u-t-<br>Task F<br>-c-r-o-s-s-o-u-t-<br>Task H<br>Task I<br>Task G<br>+Task C<br><br>So yeah I love how CIAF2 is evolving in front of me.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Caibre65! Yes the current initiative is there to "draw your attention to it and make it more likely to stand out" as you put it.  You do not have to do it when you get to it<br><br>The current initiative essentially replaces the dismissal process of AF2 and the rewriting of the oldest task of AF2ND as the motive force of the system.  How well it does to clean up the system though remains to be seen.<br><br>And you are still using AF2ND occasionally still? I'm surprised you are still using that!</div>

<div class="content">Hi nuntym<br><br>AF2ND is a great way to weed or tidy your list over a short period of time. However, the constant rewriting becomes tedious (to me) after a while. I can't really remember why you abandoned it yourself though.</div>

<div class="content">Caibre65:<br><br>"AF2ND is a great way to weed or tidy your list over a short period of time. However, the constant rewriting becomes tedious (to me) after a while. I can't really remember why you abandoned it yourself though."<br><br>A way around the constant rewriting of AF2ND (Autofocus 2, No Dismissal), is to use the dismissal of AF2 to batch process this. In the morning, when it's time to dismiss a group of tasks like in AF2, rewrite the group at the end of the list. No more rewriting of tasks from the start of the list is necessary until the next morning. Essentially, just use Autofocus 2. <br><br>Why?<br><br>If you think about it, the dismissal process of AF2 is allowing you to:<br><br>• Examine why you've not actioned a task yet<br>• Change the wording of a task<br>• Delete no longer relevant tasks<br><br>AF2ND is allowing you to overcome one of the drawbacks of AF2—rarely reaching the tasks at the start of the list. By moving tasks from the start to the end, you are more likely to action those tasks, decide how to reword them, or delete them. Following the dismissal process of AF2 achieves exactly the same thing more efficiently and without the constant rewriting.</div>

<div class="content">Hello again Caibre65.<br><br>Well I don't think I ever mentioned why I stopped using AF2ND, but if I remember right there were basically two reasons.  One is, as you mentioned, the tediousness of rewriting the oldest tasks.  Second is that the mixing of old and new tasks just diluted the power of AF2, since the newer tasks get buried by the older tasks and the older tasks blend in with other tasks when scanning.<br><br>Although it never did occur to me to do the process at bursts only.  Interesting idea, I might try that in the future.<br><br>And hello Michael B. I do not know why, but I never did like dismissal on any of the AF's, and Mark's systems did seem to abandon the idea eventually.</div>

<div class="content">nuntym:<br><br>"...the mixing of old and new tasks just diluted the power of AF2, since the newer tasks get buried by the older tasks and the older tasks blend in with other tasks when scanning."<br><br>Hello, nuntym. Perhaps one could do the following:<br><br>1. Every morning, draw a fresh line in the next available space at the end of your list. <br>2. Move the oldest block of unactioned tasks at the beginning of the list to the end. Similar to AF2. <br>3. Draw another line in the next available space at the end of the list.<br>4. So that only one block of older tasks is visible at a time, simply write the word "Task" (or perhaps the date) over the previous morning's drawn lines. Then those previous lines will appear to be crossed out tasks and will not distract you from seeing the current block of older tasks.</div>

<div class="content">Essentially, this is AF2 with the dismissal block moved to the end of the list, with no dismissal. Every morning the oldest block of unactioned tasks visually replace the previous day's block at the end of the list.<br><br>Or, one could use the dismissal process on this block at the end of the list. Starting in the morning, you have 24 hours to help these tasks escape from their block or they're all deleted.</div>

<div class="content">I have decided to abandon this idea.  Too much resistance was happening in using it, to the point that there were days I did not pick the notebook up.</div>
