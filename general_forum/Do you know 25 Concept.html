<div class="content">Hi,<br><br>I have used AF4 and DWM system but this system I explain here works well to me.<br><br>Some years ago I read about one Time management system that was based on some psychology study. Some fortune 500 CEO's use this system paper based <br>I have lost t he pdf file :(<br><br>I will try to explain it let see if you understand.<br><br>Each task you do need to be done between 2 and 5 times unit.<br>Time unit is hour , day , week , year. Other time unit can be use but I use those.<br><br>Example :<br><br>Hour.<br>You call a customer and he says call me back later today. Then you should call him back between 2 to 5 hours from now.<br>1 hours is to quick and 6 hours is to faraway.<br><br>Day.<br>You send an email to a friend / contact. You can/should remind him  between 2 to 5 days from now.<br><br>Weeks.<br>You order some books on one e-shop. The product should arrive between 2 to 5 weeks.<br><br>Today I use one Google spreadsheet that I can read / update in my mobile phone. Very basic spreadsheet but works for me. <br><br><br><br>Maybe someone here have the pdf or use such system.</div>

<div class="content">I get the concept, sort of.  But to say I should call my friend 2-5 days from now is fine.  (why 1 or 7 is bad I don't understand)  But how does this work in practice?  Do you choose a number?  Do you write stuff on a Days list, and everyday tick things so you know how many days have expired?<br><br>Is this list mostly for items that require you to wait for something, or is this intended for everything?</div>

<div class="content">Hi,<br><br>I do not remember why 2 to 5 was the best. If I found the study I can sent it over they explained everything.<br><br>I use this for all my tasks.<br>I do not know how people use this on paper based system.<br><br>I use Google spreadsheet so my "working days" are give by the spreadsheet.<br>So I get the tasks I need to work on. <br>I also have priority on my tasks.<br><br>B.R<br>Henrik</div>

<div class="content">Sounds pretty similar to DWM.  If a task is entered at Today+7, then I can take action on the task anytime from today to today+7.</div>
