<div class="content">Here's how I've been combining FV and the Random method and it's been amazing. First, my default, "go-to" method is the random method, where I just pick a number at random and do that task. This method has been described elsewhere, and it has the advantage of completely eliminating resistance. Little and often apply, and I throw anything and everything at the list, as other autofocus systems. <br><br>However, at the beginning of the day, and whenever necessary, I start at the end of the list and ask "is there anything I need to work on right now, before I start the random method?" Sometimes two or three tasks stand out, sometimes none. If there are tasks that stand out, I put a dot beside them and do them in whatever order feels right. Then, back in random mode I start with the last task completed. <br><br>The idea is to be on top of my stuff enough that I don't have to resort to FV, but it's there if I need it. This way, deadlines are met and urgent matters can be addressed easily. What do you think? <br><br>Paul MacNeil</div>

<div class="content">In practice this is very similar to what I've been doing in a more ad-hoc fashion, i.e. suspending “random” when something stands out and should be done first: systems are there to help, not to enslave :-)</div>

<div class="content">I really like this way, Paul. It gets all those things tugging at you to be done out of the way first, leaving peace of mind to get on and enjoy processing the rest of the tasks. <br><br>FV and Random are my mainstays - the methods that produce results and make me feel good about my choices and, hence, my life.</div>

<div class="content">I'm thinking about another tweak for the "random method:" Rather than use FV and random (as above), I'm treating the last page as AF1 - when I arrive on the last page, I drop the dice and just circulate around until everything is worked that feels ready to be worked on. If items on the last page spill over onto a new page (making the last page the second last page) I keep working on the same page (i.e. the second last page). <br>This way, urgent items get a fair shake. If an urgent item comes up, I add it to the last page and start working the last page as AF1 regardless. BTW, my pages are only 22 lines long, my random string is based on any number between 1 - 15. I'm a bit nervous about getting stuck on the last page, but it should be fine if I follow AF1 rules about moving from page to page. Once I feel ready to move on from the last page, I start the random method from the last task that I worked on. I'll let you know how it works out.</div>

That way some urgent tasks may get missed. Maybe treat everything that's arrived since your last visit as one virtual page. All you would have to do is to mark the end of the list each time you go back to the beginning of the list - or just start AF1 processing from the last page to have a crossed-out task.</div>
