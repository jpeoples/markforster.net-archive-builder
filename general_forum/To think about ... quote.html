<div class="content">Hi - a week or so ago, the "To think about..." quote to the right-hand side of the website was something about being idle being harder work than having employment, words to that effect.  I meant to take a note at the time but forgot.  Can anyone remind me of it?  Is there a section where past quotes can be accessed?  Thanks for your help.</div>

<div class="content">“He has nothing to prevent him but too much idleness, which, I have observed fills up a man’s time much more completely and leaves him less his own master, than any sort of employment whatsoever.” –Edmund Burke<br><br>No, I don't keep any record of which quotes I've posted and when. But I do keep all past, present and future quotes, so as long as you can remember a word or two I may be able to find it. Best to copy it at the time though!</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for that, Mark - that's the one.  I've already copied the current one - a reminder to me that my own version of ignoring reality will come back and bite me soon.  I've been spending too much time planning work, and too little time doing it.</div>
