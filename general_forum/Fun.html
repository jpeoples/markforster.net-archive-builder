<div class="content">Ok, after a month or so of trial and error, I've got my system sorted out (I just had way too many commitments) Now I'm pretty much getting my list done every day. One problem though, I'm working all day every day and there isn't any time left for fun. Any suggestions?</div>

<div class="content">Hi, Dave. I suggest you have a time in the evening at which you stop working whether you've finished or not (say 6pm), and also at least one day a week in which you do no work (Sunday?). It's also a good idea to have a set time for lunch during which you do no work either.<br><br>You may find that you actually get more done by limiting your work time in this way. Working all hours of the day and night can seriously damage your productivity.</div>
