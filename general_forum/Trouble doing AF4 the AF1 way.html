<div class="content">As I understand the AF4 directions I am supposed to cycle through the open tasks of my open resp. closed list sequentially and choose one that stands out. This "do? yes/no/next" feels quite different from the "scan, reread, choose one or none" in AF1.<br><br>In my notebook whenever I close an open list and start a new one I start it on a new page so I can handle my open and my closed list page-wise as in AF1. This works great for the closed list. In the open list, however, in AF4 I am supposed to return to the closed list after one sequential run through the open list and I have trouble to define this point when working page-wise (i.e. how many AF1-rereads equal one sequential scan?).<br><br>Do I miss something?</div>

<div class="content">We can close this (short) thread. Error #1: Not thinking before posting.<br><br>I just realized that by doing AF4 pagewise I am actually doing a modified AF1. It works well but only because I currently have quite short (2-4 pages) closed and open lists.<br><br></div>
