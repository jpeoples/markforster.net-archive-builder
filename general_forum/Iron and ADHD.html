<div class="content">Several months ago, in response to one of my less productive weeks, people here suggested I get my iron checked. I assumed it was the usual borderline low, but last week's numbers came back even lower. Thanks for the heads-up!<br><br>This article just came up on my news feed.<br><a href="http://medicalxpress.com/news/2013-12-mri-technique-reveals-brain-iron.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://medicalxpress.com/news/2013-12-mri-technique-reveals-brain-iron.html</a><br><br>Newer, more accurate MRI methods confirm the suspicion that kids with ADHD have low iron in their brain, and the stimulant meds change that.<br><br>It's a very small sample. It also doesn't say whether the problem is iron levels in the blood or actually getting the iron into the brain.<br><br>Regardless, it's one more reason to remember my daily pills. I'm also going to ask the pediatrician about a safe dose for the kids.</div>
