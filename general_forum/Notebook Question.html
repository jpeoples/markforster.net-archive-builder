<div class="content">I'm curious about a set-up issue. Do you carry around one notebook with the list and a second, separate notebook for taking notes? Or does everything go into one notebook? I'm very interested in trying this out, but I tend to take a lot of notes during the day and am not loving the idea of commingling notes/tasks or carrying around two notebooks. How do you handle this?</div>

<div class="content">I use one notebook. I have written about  it extensively on the forum and a blog. It makes life simpler to only have to worry about one thing. I recommend writing in one place and reviewing the one place often. A spiral notebook works great. You cen get my free ebooks here if you are interested<br><br><a href="http://simpletimemanagement.blogspot.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://simpletimemanagement.blogspot.com/</a></div>

<div class="content">Mike,<br><br>We have discussed the concept of a free-form notebook several times on this forum.  Here are three postings:<br><br><a href="../general_forum/Free-Form Notebook.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/1582112</a><br><br><a href="../general_forum/Free-Form Notebook.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/1603504</a><br><br><a href="../fvp_forum/Free-form FV.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/fv-forum/post/1864819</a><br><br>Hope this helps,</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the information. This is helpful. Can you give me an example of what the back of your notebook looks like? Is it a list of tasks? Or just the three daily goals? What would a sample set of goals be for a given day?</div>

<div class="content">How is a "note" not an item in a list?<br><br>Aren't the "notes items" not a list by themselves?<br><br>I am using a single notebook for both the "notes" and the "system" and it works pretty well.  I am with Gerry: review often.  Also: re-write.  It will make the notes more current, you incorporate knew thoughts and information that occured since the last time you jotted the "notes item" down.<br><br>Develop your own way to paginate.  Use coloured pencils.  It is easier to carry many pens than to carry many books.</div>

<div class="content">Mike:<br><br>My list remains on my desk, static, and doesn't travel with me. It's not a notebook but a loose-leaf binder with lined A4 sheets.<br><br>When out-and-about I write notes on unlined record cards which I then scan into my Doxie scanner at the earliest opportunity. I often take the scanner with me to meetings. It all then goes straight into Evernote.</div>

<div class="content">Alan:<br><br>I extract any action points in them into the list in the binder. But having the notes in Evernote means I can reference them easily.</div>

<div class="content">I'm in the one-book camp. (Two if you count my purse book, which is an extension of the desk book.) Most of my notes are short-term.<br><br>If a page is mostly notes, I draw a circle in the margin beside each action item (including "decide if this is an action item" and "at the break, tell Joe...") If a page is mostly tasks or planning, I draw a box around notes.<br><br>Of course, if there's a better place handy, I use it. A few projects have their own files. Calendar is obvious. If the better place isn't handy, notes go into the everything book. Since that book is also my todo list, I review it often. I do my weekly planning in the same book.<br><br>I tear the corner of each page as the action items are finished.<br><br>I carry a small book in my purse, and use in it the same way. The only difference is I don't check it every day.<br><br>The downside to this is filing. I tear out the page, or transcribe, or photo-copy, depending on what else is on the page and how neat it is, and the type of book binding. Most of the notes are short- or mid-term, so I let it sit for a few months rather than file things immediately. By that time, most of the pages can be thrown out.<br><br>I have a few tricks to make filing easier, but don't always use them in the moment.<br><br>The best method changes with job and your temperament. At school, I carried a folder for each class, and they were information-dense. I have a separate book for work, and use my purse book for home notes taken at work and vice-versa. (Often, it was "Write in book in front of me. Oops, better re-write that in the right place.")<br><br>Dad takes neat-enough notes for work all in one book, then indexes them and shelves the books by date. Extra notes either get glued into the notebook or go in a separate file. He often has to look up old notes, but rarely has to carry them around. He's a design engineer, and does much of his thinking and brainstorming in those books, in black ink. Supposedly that helps if there's a patent dispute. His daily and weekly planning, though, go on separate sheets that are tossed, as do any rough drafts.<br><br>A lawyer, on the other hand, wouldn't want to carry six months of notebooks, including notes from unrelated cases, to each meeting. Nor would she want to keep a record of her brainstorming.</div>
