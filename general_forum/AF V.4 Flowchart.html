<div class="content">Hi<br><br>I've been trialling the AF system, especially after buying and reading Mark's great book Do It Tomorrow.  With the preliminary instructions I setup my ruled notebook so that I had notes on the left hand page and tasks on the right hand side. (A great suggestion from another Forum user)<br><br>After running with the system for about 2 weeks I was losing track of the method and needing to refer to the printed instructions, which I kept losing meant almost putting a task entry of 'Print out AF V.4 Instructions' on my task list.<br><br>Well to make a long story shorter I put the instructions into a flow chart.  Not sure how to upload files to the forum, so i've put it on my me.com account as <a href="http://files.me.com/grantsayer/b9nqmw" rel="nofollow">http://files.me.com/grantsayer/b9nqmw</a>   What i do now is paste a copy (it's formatted for A4 size) in the front cover of ruled notebook and then I can easily refer back to the process when I get lost in the detail.<br><br>Interested in comments on anything I've left out.<br><br>grant</div>

<div class="content">Hi Grant,<br>Thanks for that.  I was wondering when someone would do a flowchart of AF4.<br>I think you've missed a few bits out.<br>When you finish the closed list (I think Mark has suggested changing the name from Backlog to closed list), IF you have worked on any item on that pass then you need to go back through the closed list again.  And again, and again - as long as you keep working on at least one item in a pass through.  Only when you pass through it without working on any item do you get to move to the active list (where you are only allowed a single pass).<br>Also, if your very FIRST pass through the closed list doesn't lead to any item being worked on, then any of the un-crossed-out items are highlighted for review on the next pass through (after marking the new closed list and working through it, and any new active list).<br><br>Does that make sense?<br>It's a simple and elegant system, but strangely difficult to capture in a flowchart.<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Ben<br><br>Thanks for the comments.   I'll revise the flowchart and upload a new version.<br><br>Your right that converting the process to a flow chart was more complex than I first thought.  It did help to clarify the process.<br><br>grant</div>

<div class="content">Ben:<br><br>>un-crossed-out items are highlighted for review on the next pass through (after marking the new closed list and working through it, and any new active list)<<br><br>I don't think the new active list is worked through at this time. The highlighted items are revisited when the expanded closed list has been worked through, and one cycles through the new closed list for the time being, until there is a pass where nothing is done - then one works through the new active list.<br><br>Correct me if I am wrong.<br><br>Laurence</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark<br><br><<I would be interested to know which bits of the system (or the instructions) were causing this problem.>><br><br>Firstly, overall the instructions were better to follow since it fitted on one sheet of paper printed double sided.<br><br>Where I tended to need to refer back to the steps was at Steps 4, 5.  Given that i've worked through the other AF versions I figure that I hadn't read this part as close as I should.  Hence the motivation to make a (supposed) simple flowchart to put on the inside cover of my notebook.<br><br>The other item was Step 6.  Here you are working in the Active list, as stated, working on tasks that feel ready to be done.  What happens if you don't complete a task on the Active list.  Is it just crossed out and re-entered at the end of the Active List ?<br><br>Hopefully that made some sense :-)<br><br><br>regards<br>grant</div>

Presumably you did not do a whole slew of them ;-)<br><br>Basically, you do the same thing at the end of a pass of the open list no matter what ... you go back to the closed list.  The only "choices" you make are with the closed list.</div>

<div class="content">I believe I understand what Grant is asking, and I think the answer is yes. If you get to a task in the Active list and work on it but don't finish (or know that you will need to do again soon anyway), then you cross it off and re-enter it at the end of the Active list, which means, obviously, that you will hit this task again before reaching the end of the Active list. I actually love this, as it works very well for things like "process email," which I want to deal with on a regular basis but with other tasks in between.</div>

<div class="content">I've made a flow chart of my own, based on Grant's version to the benefit of myself and whoever finds it useful. I clarified Grant's version a bit (I hope) by distinguishing between closed and open lists and I also added recurring tasks to the flow chart.<br><br>You can check it out here: <a href="http://create.ly/fzr4bk5y3" rel="nofollow">http://create.ly/fzr4bk5y3</a></div>

Would you mind me using that chart (or derivative of it) to describe in a blogpost how to use AF4 on a Google Docs spreadsheet I'm currently using? Thanks. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Add another gray box: "Start at the beginning of this "closed list", which goes directly into the top of the first green decision box.  This clarifies what you do the first (and only) time you start the list.<br><br>Add some more arrow heads to clarify the direction of processing for some of the paths.<br><br>If the task is complete you don't mark it done.<br><br>There may be other things but I'm pushed for time right now ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Following on from Tijl's great version of the chart and inspired by the colour palette :-) I've created another version of my original chart.  The updated version is at <a href="http://files.me.com/grantsayer/w25yiv" rel="nofollow">http://files.me.com/grantsayer/w25yiv</a><br><br>If anyone wants the source for the diagram (it's in OmniGraffle format - for Mac OS X) let me know</div>

<div class="content">Heya fellow flowchart geeks, I'm here to join the party with my own contribution! :)<br><br><a href="http://screencast.com/t/vyb2qzZP" rel="nofollow">http://screencast.com/t/vyb2qzZP</a><br><br>I made mine with the intention that it will guide me in everyday use, so it doesn't include information about how to set up the list in the first place and it doesn't explain much about the difference between open and closed lists -- it just shows what to do when working through them and transitioning between them.  It also doesn't really specify where to start, although item in the top left corner was purposely chosen to remind me that the point is to DO the things on the list, not just have an awesomely designed list with a great system that might maybe help me get through them.<br><br>I also coined a term for myself that sums up the notion of a task feeling ready to do:  I consider it to be RIPE.  This evokes the idea of a juicy fruit hanging from a tree, ready to be plucked and eaten. Yum!  I also use the term when I am dismissing items on the Closed List if I made a pass through without doing any:  I say the highlighter 'ripens' the tasks.  They must then either be done on the next pass, or dismissed, or revised and readded, or whatever, but the point is that they must be handled some way or another or else they'll start to rot and stink and nobody wants that! :)<br><br>I also tend to scribble out processed tasks completely (because it's fun!), so if a dismissed task might be worth doing someday, I have to add it to a completely different list.  (I use Toodledo, and might eventually figure out a way to use it for AutoFocus, but I first want to work from paper so I can get a feel for what I need to make Toodledo do.  If you want to check out Toodledo via my referral link -- <a href="http://www.toodledo.com/index.php?ref=td470bfd1829679" rel="nofollow">http://www.toodledo.com/index.php?ref=td470bfd1829679</a> -- and if you end up liking it and become a paying customer like I am, you'll bless me with a 3 month extension on my account.)  This also means that I don't have anything in the flowchart about how to handle highlighted tasks:  they are marked as ripe, and then I am forced to deal with them, one way or another, on the next pass.  And then I scribble them out furiously!<br><br>I designed my flowchart of appropriate proportions to print on an index card, but I zoomed in for the screenshot I took of it so it would be easier to be read.  It's a PNG so it should be able to be shrunk down for printing at whatever size you like.<br><br>I might revise it a bit as I get practice using the system, but I felt like sharing this now even though it's a work in progress.  I should point out that this sharing of the flowchart isn't actually ON the list, and so I really shouldn't be letting myself do it at all!  I must still be procrastinating tasks on my list still... but I am giving myself to be a work in progress too.</div>

<div class="content">Oops. That last sentence should say, "giving myself PERMISSION to be a work in progress".  I guess that means I'm allowed to miss words in sentences too?<br><br>Figures I check back for replies, and all I see is an editing error on my part. I was so sure I reread that a bunch of times before posting... oops! :)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Qrystal. Just had a look at your AF4 chart. Yours is certainly simpler and more compact than TijlKindt's AF4 chart. It a toss up between the two charts. But FWIW I'll go for TijlKindt's cause it's more specific. ;-)</div>
