<div class="content">I am very disappointed, and hesitate to call this a system. For me it ends up in one long To-Do-list where it is hard to find what I should do next. Being a very active procrastinator, it only increases my unease of mind. This is how I feel.<br>I have say 10 pages with items. I have sorted out some items on each page, lots of easy wins, doing the obvious things that I can easily do. That's fine.<br>But after some days, it is getting tough. When I'm back on page one, eventually, I suddenly can't find anything to 'stick out' enough, among the remaining 3-8 (for example) items on this page. I have un uneasy feeling that there are more urgent things somewhere, on a later page, that I _should_ do instead. So I don't feel like doing any of the page one items. Same on page two, I don't 'feel like doing' anything there. This creates a big loop for me, looping through all the pages, trying to find the one that I should start with. In the end, it's nothing better that having one giant list to browse through.<br>And the rule that if in the first reading of a page, I don't feel like doing anything on the page, I should highlight these items, close the page, and not reenter them again (since I'm not committed to doing them, obviously) - that makes me even more uneasy.<br>I get the feeling of closing this page of a few 'someday/maybe' items, some not so important items (as maybe some other items on another page), and then loosing them for some time (until I start thinking that at least a few of them maybe should have stayed).<br><br>This method seems to be far to random for my mind. If a couple of heavy tasks happen to be left on the same page, they tend to be closed, since I don't feel like doing any of them, since I have in my mind that there are some other, less heavy things, more important(?) somewhere else, that I could 'feel like doing'.<br>The closing of pages with 'non committable tasks' makes me uneasy, and I can't trust that the system keeps what is relatively most important any more.<br>So what else can I do: looping throught the pages to find the one task to start with?<br><br>I am stuck. Easy wins I have done away with, so I was happy for a while, but now I don't trust my system any more.<br>I have to look through my closed pages, to reenter a few of those items. When they are done, it's back to zero again. The idea of splitting up the list only ends in suboptimizing. I'm doing some things, but I don't think it's the best use of my time.<br></div>

<div class="content">There are certain points I do agree with here, the system does feel like a huge "to-do list" with no end.<br><br>I too have a few larger tasks on the first few pages, but the more I enter things at the end of my list, the more I procrastinate over the earlier larger items.<br><br>I just can't get this feeling of items "standing out" at all - just looking through the list fills me with dread so I just end up picking out the easier tasks to do.<br><br>I don't get the "closed list" feeling or sense of achievement as I did with DIT - it just seems, as I said, a never-ending, open-ended to-do list.<br><br>Maybe some day soon something will leap out at me, I do hope so!<br><br>Simon</div>

<div class="content">Jabbe and Simon:<br><br>Since you are having such problems with procrastination, here are a few suggestions:<br><br>1) If you can't get the hang of "standing out", then just give yourself a rule that you must work on at least one item per page before moving on to the next page. (You can do more than one item if you want to)<br><br>2) With the more difficult items that you are resisting hard, cross them out and re-enter them at the end of the list as easier first steps so that they too become "easy wins". This counts as "working on an item".</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>I really like these two simple suggestions you provided. I hope they make it into your final version of the instructions,</div>

<div class="meta">2009-01-15 8:20</div>
<div class="content">Jabble:<br><br>One aspect of the instructions that is very important here, and that I have the feeling is not fully appreciated, is that you *don't have to finish a task* to cross it off and re-enter it.<br><br>I tend to have difficulties with procrastination myself, and once only a limited number of tasks is left on a page, they're all the hard ones and I don't feel like doing them. But the rule mentioned above gives you a way out. What I do is take one of those tasks (most of the time, you'll know on which one you need to progress), and just find a simple thing to do that still creates some progress (like making a list of steps to completion, or starting to draft an email, or booking a meeting, or just jotting some ideas on paper). This removes the resistance. Even if you stop after that you'll have made some progress, can re-enter the task at the end and move on to the next page. And often, just starting doing this small action, you'll find you continue working on the task without even realising it.<br><br>If you didn't already do so, I strongly recommend you read Mark's article on this site "I'll just get the file out", which explains this approach. I've been known to procrastinate quite a lot, but this really works for me, especially as it's backed up by the rules of the AF approach (I prefer to call it an approach rather than a system).<br><br>Hope this helps...</div>

<div class="content">I have also suffer from procrastination and, like many people, tend to do the easy "busy" work and put off the things I am resisting. I hit this problem with AF yesterday as my first active page had only four items left, all of which do need to be done but I was resisting doing all of them. <br><br>Following the rules nothing "stood out" but if I didn't do any of them I had to dismiss them which wasn't an option. Then I realised I only had to work on one of them and then not to completion so I just picked one and once I got started on it I actually did complete all the work that could be done now and felt really pleased that I'd cleared one of my tasks that had been outstanding for about a month. The last step was to send the results out to someone else and enter on my AF list " response rec'd from x (email sent 14/1) ?"<br><br>I then did a bit of thinking about why I was resisting these particular tasks and it helped to clarify some of the reasons why I am not happy in my current role at work. This will be useful as telling my boss I hate my job probably wouldn't be a good idea in the current climate - but talking to my boss about maybe doing things differently could be a win-win<br><br>So as well as doing a small action on a task you are resisting and then re-entering have a think about why you are resisting it and see if you can do anything about it. Enter new item on A+F list of think about resistance to whatever it is. Hope this is helpful<br>cheers<br>H</div>

<div class="content">I think Marc from Brussels is right. Again, I think this is mostly not a problem of the system itself, but the problem of how to phrase the task when you write it down. Most items can be jotted down in a way that you are wouldn't have to commit large amounts of time to consider them accomplished ("begin first draft" instead of "write proposal", "think about X" instead of "plan out X" etc.).</div>

<div class="meta">2009-01-15 8:47</div>
<div class="content">I think Helen's reply pretty much sums up how I feel about the advantages of the AF approach. There's still resistance when only the "worst" items are left, but I have to do something about at least one of them. While it's a minor achievement, it still feels like I'm passing a major obstacle. I haven't really felt that way before, having tried the DIT system among other things.</div>

<div class="content">I understand it could be enough, from the system point of view, just to do one thing on the page, and even just do a small part of one item, and then rewrite it on the last page.<br>But this creates another uneasy feeling for me: lack of focus. It is best, for me, to try to concentrate on one task at a time. Then having to scrape on another, just for the system's sake, doesn't make sense. Then I'll have to reset my mind when I later come back to that task again.<br>It is also a problem with the AF system, to keep track of what is called projects (in GTD lingo). If I haven't prepared the steps in one project in advance, I will have to restart the project the next time again, loosing time to rethink what to do next in the 'project'.<br>That's one thing I miss in AF, some link or reference to other material, mindmap or whatever.<br>I really see some advantages with AF, also in combination with GTD. But I also, as a beta-tester, wanted to point 2-3 major riscs:<br>- It's easy to just select (and even create) easy, trivial items, to make the system 'float'.<br>- Depending on the size and the number of pages, you can get the feeling that you might miss some important task's deadline on some later page (which page size you choose has some influence on this, imo)<br>- The random combination of tasks on one page (e.g. active low-prio + vague ideas) might result in some things inadvertently being dismissed and 'lost' for some time (they may be impossible to do for some days for overload reasons - and therefore the page was closed - but possible when other urgent things are cleared)<br><br>I like the my GTD system, because I trust I have everything in it.<br>But I hate it when it comes to selecting what to do. i think AF might help, if I can get a trusting feeling.</div>

<div class="content">Jabbe:<br><br>It's difficult to advise you without knowing more about your work cirumstances, but I am picking up on what you say about liking GTD because you trust you have everything in it but you hate it when it comes to selecting what to do.<br><br>To me it sounds as if you like the system more because it gives you a feeling of security than because it actually helps you to get things done. If I'm wrong in this, I am only going by what you have said.<br><br>To get a feeling of security from Autofocus (and to get things done as well) you really have to let go of your ideas about GTD or any other system, and work AF as it is supposed to be worked. If it's working properly, you will be on top of your projects because they are fresh in your mind, not because you've got them written on some list somewhere.</div>

<div class="content">Just two days ago, I added an item on my AF lists: "Create some project/initiative sheets". While I feel I'm making more and easier progress on the projects/initiatives I'm assigned to, and even am able to handle more of them in parallel, sometimes I may have some problems when I need to give a status on them in my weekly meetings with my boss. Just saying it's progressing and I'm confident I'll get there without some form of overview isn't really reassuring for him.<br><br>Even when using AF to drive the tasks forward, you need some project documentation on the side as supporting material (unless you're only facing small tasks). And that's where I plan to keep a list for the more extensive ones where I list major tasks and milestones achieved.</div>

<div class="content">AF isn't for project management, it's for getting things done. When I'm working the system I end up doing work on projects that are important but I know I would have otherwise put off for "more important" stuff. But AF (and GTD for that matter) runs on the philosophy that everything needs to get done. The beauty of AF (and advantage over GTD) is that I spend very little time categorising tasks lists (I only have three separate places: work/home, my parents' home, and errands) and I was able to start right away, it also lets me capture ideas that come into my head without the associated of stress of "how do I categorise this into the system" - it goes into the system, when I see it next I either take action on it if I can or I put it somewhere I can.<br><br>I keep my project lists separate as it will have lots of things that can't be done now or are dependent tasks. Next actions or near actions go into my list. But here again, I don't worry too much whether it's strictly a next action a la GTD, but if it's near enough - if for some reason I need another task to happen, I'll re-enter it with the task that needs to get done first (or if that prior task is on that page, do that task). I find that AF is less about working out exactly what you have to do before you do it (like GTD) though you can do this if you like, but it works very well with less defined tasks - if you need to refine it down, you will. If you don't, you save time.<br><br>While I still have room for improvement, I am finding I'm consistently doing more work on things before they are due and chipping away at stuff I'd normally ignore through extreme procrastination. I never finish my closed lists anyway so I'm not missing out on that satisfaction!  I feel better about myself because I do far less procrastination (and will hopefully eliminate it all together once the system finds equilibrium - ie I've caught up with my backlog, readjusted to a more sustainable workload and find myself regularly working on things before they are urgent).</div>

<div class="content">My circumstances: today I've got roughly 30 items to-do within 2 days,, constantly changing. I also have about 10 real projects (2-5 days of work each) + 50-80 things I need to do within say 1-3 months, >150 other ideas of things to start (in GTD called someday/maybe).<br>The last 150 I reall don't want to keep fresh in my mind, because then I will start thinking about them, even though I know I can't commit to doing them now. I want to have them safely tucked away, to look at once a month or so. If I keep them in AF, I will get the problems I described, imo.<br>I think I'm 'on top of my projects, i.e. the 30 + 10. The 50-80 could be in the same list, and I need a reminder now and then, to start working on them, before it's getting too late.<br><br>The feeling of security is important to me. If that is lost, I will disturb myself with thoughts about things that I really don't need to think about now (or maybe I do...?) <br>If I know I have every input safe somewhere, knowing how to locate it again, I don't have to worry about forgetting anything.<br>The security feeling is vital, otherwise I have a hard time concentrating on one thing at a time.<br><br>The big problem of working with these ~250 items in the same list, mixed up in random, is my major concern with working with AF. I can't dismiss a page, because I am not sure if it contains 'not-so-urgent' things together with 'possible ideas'. Keeping all this 'fresh in my mind' reading through the pages will be a huge waste of time and thinking.<br><br>But maybe I misunderstand AF? Should everything, regardless of 'urgency' and 'importance' be mixed, or is it only meant for more active tasks?</div>

<div class="meta">2009-01-15 12:06</div>
<div class="content">Jabbe:<br><br>One of the things I’m am finding from the Beta Testing is that people who import all their tasks into AF from a previous system tend to have problems. It’s not that the system itself can’t cope with the tasks. It’s that the people themselves tend to get symptoms of overwhelm because they are giving themselves too much stress right at the beginning to be able to learn to work the system correctly.<br><br>So what I am recommending (and will incorporate in the revised instructions) is that one should start Autofocus just by writing down the first few tasks that come into one’s head, and then add tasks as one thinks of them or as they come up. That way the list grows “organically” and one is actively engaged with all the tasks that have been entered. That greatly reduces the feelings of overwhelm.<br></div>

<div class="meta">2009-01-15 12:11</div>
<div class="content">Hi Jabbe,<br><br>The point of AutoFocus (as I see it) is to keep you "automatically focused" on what you need to be DOING right now.  Not everything SHOULD go on the AutoFocus list(s).  In fact, the immediate fallout of runing the list as described, is to flush out the "someday/maybe" items.  If they were put on the list, and if your book is a bound one (as Mark uses) you will have a history of highlighted "someday/maybe" items that you are not going to work on until ... well, someday ... maybe.<br><br>If you know in advance that an item is "someday/maybe", simply do not put it on your list ... or put it on your list and dismiss it immediately if you wish to keep all items in that same book.  My own personal preference is to do my planning (Vision/Mission/Objectives/Goals/etc.) on the computer in some simple word processing program (used to be MS Word, is now OneNote).  My planning document does not need a lot of frequent reference.  I do it only once a week.  That planning/replanning exercise produces "actions" that get put on my list and the list is worked for a week.  Thus has it always been (well, for the last 40 years or so anyway ;-)<br><br>There is absolutely no reason that everything MUST go into AF.  However, I can see that AF will accommodate everything ... one way or another.  And there is something to be said for one place for everything.</div>

<div class="content">Helen<br><br>Your post is really helpful in explaining the way in which AF does help to clarify why we are resisting things and they can be quite major reasons such as not being totally satisfied with your job - what I find so beneficial is that it doesn't just leave you there but that the added focus enables either a solution to be found, or a way to approach the issue which we would have been too stressed by to even consider previously.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-01-15 23:04</div>
<div class="content">Jabbe<br><br>Like Catherine I keep project work separate but refernce those projects, either as "next action" tasks or to remind myself to work on a project where all of the relevant data is in another place.  For something to be sufficiently large to be considered a project it will normally have a load of accompanying £stuff", whether physical, files, papers, correspondence etc, or virtual, data files etc.  That "stuff" needs to organised in one way or another and controlled in order for it to reach completion.  For me AF manages that process perfectly, not necessarily in the same way for each project (eg some projects will be listed in more detail than others) but above all it does give me that sense of control which you say you are lacking.<br><br>As Mark says, don't try to enter all of your backlog into the system in one go, but be willing to look at introducing some of those items gradully over a period of time.  That will enable them to be evaluated by the system and fall naturally into the right place. Marc (from Brussels) mentioned preparing project sheets.  That is a great way to manage projects - if you have some form of summary document - be it a list of next actions, details of where things related to project are, or a staus report, then that immediately helps to refocus your mind on that project when you next return to it.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-01-16 19:04</div>
<div class="content">Jabbe,<br><br>If it's any consolation, I'm having exactly the same issues and concerns with AF as you are. In fact, I decided at the beginning of this week to go back to my old system of having a daily 'must-do' (or will-do') list and I felt a huge sense of relief once I'd made that decision and had drawn up my next day's list at the end of Monday.<br><br>I have just written a very long 'report' which I will email to Mark (it's too long to post on this forum), outlining why I've decided to go back to my old system. Nevertheless, there are a number of things that I did - and still do - like about AF, and Catherine mentions one of them in her post above. It's a great way to capture everything in one place without having to worry which list it should go on.<br><br>I'm planning to carry on using AF, but only for non-deadline or time-sensitive tasks. I have also started using a separate AF list for all "billable time" tasks (I work freelance from home and am juggling a number of different jobs, clients and activities). I use my old-style daily 'must-do' list to help me keep my focus and remind me of the tasks have deadlines and *must* get done today. Once these are out of the way, or I've done sufficient work on them to warrant a 'break' I turn to my AF list, or, if I feel I need to put in a few more paid hours for that day, I have a look at the "billable time" AF list, to see if there's anything on there that stands out.<br><br>It's a bit of a hybrid system and still calibrating itself, but I already feel much more comfortable with it than I did when just autofocusing things. And I've got more on top of things again that had been sliding rather behind during the week I was just using the AF system. <br><br>I like Mike's approach, which sounds somewhat similar. I think for some people who are used to a very clearly defined structure and have previously been using relatively rigid systems, AF just feels a bit too random - a bit like free fall. Exactly what makes it so appealing to others, I suppose.</div>

<div class="content">I have three comments on AF, as I interpreted it from the beginning:<br>- I noticed in another thread a proposal to put 'same day urgent' items on a separate index card, and attach that to the 'active' page.<br>- there is also one discussion going on about not entering the backlog at once but adding these gradually. I had the same concerns about my own backlog (someday/maybe/ideas).<br>- Handling of projects, including having reference to side material, isn't too clear. It is virtually impossible (at least for me) to have all projects 'fresh in my mind' when I read through the pages - and at the same time quickly being able to focus on the task that 'stands out'.<br>This is really why I didn't consider AF to be a 'system' that would work (for me).<br><br>For a lot of other items than the three categories above, I have found AF to help me significantly. It is easier to find something to work with,  and to do that work, instead of just fiddling with the list!<br>But in the end, I also get a feeling that it's often the easy wins that are taken care of.<br>However, that's not too bad either. If you sort out quick items, you will reach the other ones sooner.<br><br>I'm also still struggling with David Allen's ideas about a 'mind like water'. You must be able to trust your system _completely_, so you can receive any and all input easily, and then focus on what you are/were doing again.  I'm not convinced that AF will provide that feeling of 'security'.<br><br>My private conclusion for now: with some clarifications on urgent items, and how to handle backlog, AF can help. I will continue trying it out.<br></div>

<div class="content">ps It has also been immensely helpful to me to be "in the forum".  By reading the posts and replying to many of them it has really enabled me to clarify my own thoughts, and to identify why something is working for me or not.  I think that in itself has probably accelerated the process for me.  What is amazing is, that although I have spent a fair amount of time in the forum, only once have I felt that I was procrastinating (which was helpful in itself to recognise - as I now instantly know the difference!) and have completed an unbelievable volume of tasks in the days since launch.</div>
