<div class="content">Hi,<br>I'm going to facilitate a group and I got the idea to do it AF style.  They have a long list of stuff, so I would put all items on a large sheet and hang it on the wall.  The participants pick a task and start working on it.  And here are my questions<br> - How to pick a task?  Pick the one that gets the most votes?  Or shall we strive for a group agreement?  Or go with the task picked by the fastest member?  Or...<br> - When to stop?  When the first member is running out of oomph?  Or when the majority feels like doing so?  Or...<br><br>Any suggestions?  Has anyone tried AF in a group setting?</div>

<div class="content">Adam:<br><br>Interesting idea - I'd love to hear how you get on with it.<br><br>Research has shown that you get the best decisions in a group context if everyone votes without knowing what the others have voted for. So you best procedure might be to give everyone a personal copy of the sheet and ask them to go down it and see which item stands out for them, then take the vote.<br><br>As for stopping, I suggest you give each member some form of marker by which they can indicate when they feel they've done enough. Once a majority of markers are showing, then stop.</div>

<div class="content">Mark, thank you for your ideas.  I didn't know about the research findings you mentioned, sounds promising.  I'll let you know how it worked.</div>

<div class="content">I realized what I was looking for was how to have a meeting in AF style.  I blogged about my (very good) experiences how an AF-inspired approach could work in a meeting:<br><br><a href="http://taskberry.com/2009/03/23/spinning-plates-meeting-method/" rel="nofollow">http://taskberry.com/2009/03/23/spinning-plates-meeting-method/</a></div>
