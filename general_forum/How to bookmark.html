<div class="content">I would like to be able to switch quickly between the first uncompleted page, the task I am currently working on, and the final page. Oh, and similarly with the end of the book, where I keep a separate list for planning meetings. Post-its are a little big. Paper clips - well, there are two sides to those! Dots (Mark's way) - require finding the page the dot is on in the first place.<br><br>So what are the rest of you using for this?</div>

<div class="content">How about Post-it tabs?  Something like these: <br><br><a href="http://www.3m.com/us/office/postit/products/prod_ft_arr.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.3m.com/us/office/postit/products/prod_ft_arr.html</a><br><br>or these:<br><br><a href="http://www.3m.com/us/office/postit/products/prod_ft_ss.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.3m.com/us/office/postit/products/prod_ft_ss.html</a><br><br>I don't use them for this purpose, but I have used them, or similar sicky, re-usable tabs, when I wanted to mark a page in a notebook temporarily.</div>

<div class="content">Try those smaller plastic kind of post it flags (the "sign here" kind).  They have a lot more staying power than regular post-it notes and come in ~ 1/4" - 1/2".</div>

<div class="content">I use these durable ones -- the one-inch kind:<br><br><a href="http://www.3m.com/us/office/postit/products/prod_ft_dur.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.3m.com/us/office/postit/products/prod_ft_dur.html</a><br><br>I like them better than paper stickies or the cheaper plastic stickies, because they can take a lot more unsticking and resticking before losing their stickiness, and are just generally more durable.<br><br>With the new AF, I have three different tabs for my last active page.  They are all the same color, but I wrote on them "Forward", "Reverse", and "Review".  I put the tab on my last page that corresponds to the mode I am in.  I keep the other two tabs stuck inside the back cover of my notebook.<br><br>I use a different colored tab to mark the page that I'm currently acting on.<br><br>Works great!</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br>I have found similar small postits in an old file, and attached them to my notebook, more or less as you describe, but I have kept them all in place, rather than finding the appropriate page manually when I change mode.<br><br>I found a translucent yellow one to mark the task (and page) I am working on - I might be able to dispense with the dot!</div>

<div class="content">The notebook I am using comes with 5 movable dividers which are also storage pockets and useful for notes or schedules.  I use those to mark the relevant pages.</div>
