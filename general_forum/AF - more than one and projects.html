<div class="content">I'd liike some help please. I have settled on AF as the best system for me but I am having a dilemma. I have three main areas with projects within each.<br><br>1. Business one - with a few large customers who each have projects I am working on. (This is a business writing, bid writing and training business).<br><br>2. Business two - lots of small customers, lots of smaller tasks, with a big output every couple of months (it's a magazine publishing business).<br><br>3. Home - lost of projects and daily/weekly/ monthly tasks.<br><br>What I am finding is that:<br><br>a) if I put everyone on one long list I get a bit confused with the two businesses, deadline stuff and the projects tasks and customer tasks all get mixed up so it's hard to see an overview for each customer/project/business<br><br>b) if I break it down into businesses/projects and so on - I sort of end up with a number of lists which can be confusing and I feel I have too many reference points.<br><br>I'm probably overthinking this (too close to the problem and am only steps away from being overwhelmed). I am only feeling overwhelmed because I can't see the wood for the trees, theoretically I do have enough time to do most of what I need to - I just end up procrastinating because I feel disorganised.<br><br>Is there an easier way to 'work the list' so to speak to sort this out?  Should I list only customers and projects and other ad hoc tasks and refer to another list to see what needs to be done? I'm very interested in finding out if anyone else has similar challenges and how you overcame them?<br><br>Many thanks in advance</div>

<div class="content">Alison, the kind folks here talked me through having a separate notebook for each major context (home, work). My experience so far has shown that I like the separation.

<div class="content">Thanks for this Erik - however I sort of have three areas rather than two and lots of projects so am unsure if I could hack three notebooks!<br><br>However thinking about it I believe separating work and home would be quite useful - although I work from home I am eager to separate the two as I tend to work too much and have to learn to draw a line under it and do other things.<br><br>So how do you guys sort out projects?  For example one of my customers has me doing all sorts of marketing work for him - we are building a new website, setting up email marketing, creating new brochures, writing bids - all quite different projects with deadlines and different tasks.  How would you use AF to deal with these?</div>

<div class="content">Tag your list items then.  <br><br>B1 - get quote for XYZ<br>B2 - deliver goods to ABC<br>B1 - etc.<br><br>As for projects I prefer to write the project details elsewhere and just name the project in AF.  It's up to you how big or small a project should be to get included in AF.  Be flexible and adapt as you feel is right.</div>

<div class="content">How about a three subject notebook.  The dividers will be built in and there will be pockets for support material in some.  You do do an AF style list for each area in the notebook.  Also, check out the article entitled project focus on my blog, it is a way to use AF style processing with projects.  Good luck.<br><br>Gerry<br><br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management</a></div>

<div class="content">Pretty much what Alan said.  Just list the NAME of the project to work on and then keep the details in a project notebook.</div>
