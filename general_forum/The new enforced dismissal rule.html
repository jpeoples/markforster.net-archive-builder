<div class="content">I am enchanted with the new AF. However, there is one thing I don't like, and more than that, I don't understand why it should be so: The paradigm shift from the "let dismissed items in peace for some time and reenter them only after a week or longer"-rule in AF1-3 (and in the original AF1 rule set, there was put very much emphasis on this rule!!) to the new "dismiss and decide almost immediately what to do with the dismissed items, either re-enter (reworded) or delete"-rule of AF4.<br><br>I have to admit that in the beginning (AF1-era), I felt uneasy with dismissals for a very long time. It was only when I went through my old lists after months and had a look on what was highlighted, I suddenly realized that really most of what had been dismissed had been RIGHTFULLY dismissed - tasks that appeared far more important at the time I entered them that they were with hindsight. So, I came to peace with dismissals, and I started to like the fact that AFs dismissal processing was creating a "someday/maybe"-list automatically, without any additional work besides the simple highlighting.<br><br>I know for sure that were I forced to decide about the fate of these rightfully dismissed tasks IMMEDIATELY, I would have re-entered most of them, thus creating unnecessary work for me!<br><br>So, I won't adopt this part of the new rule-set. I will simply dismiss the backlog/closed list when  appropriate (on no task standing out on first pass), highlight the remaining tasks and leave it alone: This appears more natural, too.<br><br>Apart from that, AF4 "is it". A real stroke of genius.</div>

<div class="content">Hi there<br><br>I can see where you're coming from but last night when I drew my first line for AF4 I decided to treat my existing 'dismissed', i.e. highlighted tasks, as if I was processing them in AF4 and it felt really liberating to realise that they aren't relevant at the moment, they could be crossed off and that they would come back into my head if they ever do become relevant again.<br><br>I guess there might be a fear that you lose a good idea along the way but my list didn't include any of them ;-)<br><br>Lucy</div>

<div class="content">Andreas:<br><br>I suggest you try it before rejecting it. I've found that this type of dismissal suits this system well.<br><br>As I said somewhere in the Comments on the live demo, I would probably not have dismissed so many tasks if I had not had an audience to whom I wanted to demonstrate the dismissal process. It would have been more like two or three at most.</div>

<div class="content">OK. I'll try it. You are right, I should not judge the system before having it used according to the word at least some time.<br><br>It was only because I had this "Wow" again I had when I came across AF1 - only that one tiny details didn't "wow" me... :-)</div>

<div class="content">Hmm - I'm not sure whether to try this one. I'm wondering whether the idea to give a talk (which led to a very rewarding project) would have been dismissed in AF4. It took a while to germinate and grow in AF1 and I think it needed the time to inculcate. I wonder if AF4 would allow intuition as much influence as in AF1. Having said that, I have been in reverse mode most of the time of late in RAF, so the same applies there too.<br><br>I'm also not sure how the automatic planning of projects (adding ideas as they come to mind) will work in AF4, as they often require some time before actioning. Perhaps the concept is to offload them to a separate project file/list.<br><br>Hanging in there with RAF till people come in with comments.<br><br>Meanwhile I have also been considering trying an AF1 type method, but using contiguous groups of unchecked tasks in place of pages, and being able to move in either direction through the list.</div>

<div class="content">If I understand it correctly highlighted and crossed out items are either dismissed or reentered into the list. So there is no explicit journaling in the list of dismissed items.  This could create a greater hesitation to dismiss (my memory has the consistency of Emmental).  <br>An alternative could be to cross out only the items that are reentered as the orthodox dismissal is a single pass and it is clear what the state of the list is. But then the dismissal lacks any physical action and that's probably worse.</div>

<div class="content">Damien:<br><br>I'm not quite sure that I understand your post, but here's a summary of what happens with dismissal in AF4:<br><br>1) You visit the Backlog and no tasks get done: Highlight all the tasks in the Backlog and convert the existing Active List into the new Backlog.<br><br>2) Continue through the new Backlog until you reach the end of the Backlog.<br><br>3) Return to the beginning of the list.<br><br>4) Cross out all the highlighted tasks. They may be discarded or re-entered, etc.<br><br>5) Continue working through the Backlog and so on.<br></div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>Here is the point I'm not clear about. <br><br>After marking items for dismissal and converting the Active List into the new Backlog, do you<br><br>A) Continue through the new backlog (multicycle) AND the active list before returning to delete the dismissed items? <br><br>Or<br><br>B) Read through the new backlog once, and count the dismissed items as part of your backlog and delete them immediately?<br><br>Your instructions (to me) seem to indicate A, but your response to Damien seems to indicate B.</div>

<div class="content">Amazing!<br><br>One week ago I started experimenting with AF2 ("Backward Mode") with a similar "Review Mode" policy.<br><br>When reviewing, I start browsing my dismissed tasks, and for each of them I decide between:<br><br>- Doing it<br>- Reenter/Rephrasing it<br>- Destroying it<br><br>This way, I keep using AF2's excellent management of urgent items, while promoting older tasks to the end of the list on a frequent basis (or doing them, or killing them). They can't stay idle.<br><br>This deals with AF2's shortcomings (not giving enough attention to older stuff), and proved to be very dynamic.<br><br>Now I'm going to try AF4, but I must say that this method worked really, really good for me.

<div class="content">As I mentioned in a blog comment, I'll definitely try this before dismissing (!) it, but it does seem to me that the threat of dismissal is greatly weakened. Earlier versions of AF always said "please take seriously the instruction to let dismissed items stand for a while..." and the reason for this, I thought, was to make dismissal something real and serious — thus making it a good way of distinguishing between tasks you're procrastinating on but really care about, vs. tasks that need weeding out of the system. With AF4, it seems likely that in a few days my brain will learn that dismissing is no big deal, eliminating this very useful filter in the system. BUT... I will try it! I promise!</div>

<div class="content">I'm a long time AF1 user. AF2 and RAF didn't appeal to me, but this new system I like: it eliminates the artificiality of the single-page sublists.<br><br>I basically use it as an AF1 list with two pages: HEAD and TAIL. The HEAD is the last, open page, never dismissed. The TAIL gets dismissed if no action is taken. I tried it and already finished my first (short) backlog. No dismissals this time. <br><br>The thing is: I always liked the AF1 dismissal rules. Dismissed items would stay around forever. That allowed me to put stuff on the list as I thought about it. Of course, I couldn't do all of it NOW. But I liked the way AF sorted out what I decided to do. The rest stayed around. It was dismissed, but nothing was really wrong with it, apart from the fact that you cannot everything at once. AF4, on the other hand, says to handle your dismissed items (almost) immediatly. So I decided to handle the dismissed items the AF1 way.<br><br>Well … so I thought. The more I think about it, the more I believe the AF4 way is right.<br><br>Why? Let me explain. Some information doesn't belong in a todo list. Some people wanted priorities, but I always thought priorities don't really belong on the list. That doesn't mean you shouldn't set priorities or think about your goals. But once on the todo list, all tasks are equal. Priorities distract from the autoFOCUS part.<br><br>Same thing with the indeterminately dismissed items. Dismissing in AF1 partially regains focus, but only partially. AF4 seems to force you to decide what to do with the TAIL, if you don't work on it. Are the tasks unclear? Are they still urgent? Or is this not the right time to do them?<br><br>Handling the AF4 TAIL is more work, because you must decide what to do with the dismissed items. On the one hand, that is a big drawback. You have to maintain an extra list with ideas and someday-items. On the other hand, the focus is clearer. We will see how this will turn out.<br><br>AF4 already made me do some tasks I wouldn't have done otherwise. I still don't really know how to feel about that.<br></div>

<div class="content">I had similar concerns about the new dismissal rules, which I posted to the "AF4 in Brief" discussion.  I'm re-posting the same comments here.<br><br>Assuming I am understanding the rules correctly, the one thing that has me a bit worried is the built-in automated processing of the highlighted items.<br><br>I'm not so sure I like having them deleted like that. I could always put them in my tickler system, but I kind of like the way AF1 would keep them percolating as long as I needed them to, with my periodic "review dismissed items". It was up to me to decide whether to delete, rewrite, put on the tickler, or whatever.<br><br>That was my initial reaction, at least.<br><br>Upon further thought, some additional things occurred to me.<br><br>(1) Mark's demo was in "high speed". He himself said it would normally take several days to work through a Closed List before any of the items got highlighted. And then it might still take a while before he got to the point of deleting those items. So, the percolation effect is still in play.<br><br>(2) In some ways the added discipline is really appealing: being forced to deal with highlighted items, forced to make a decision, not just letting them sit there to be reviewed occasionally.<br><br>(3) Maybe the new deletion of highlighted items changes the psychology of the system (for better, or for worse?), and maybe it will mean lots of rewriting and redispositioning of highlighted tasks. But I'll just have to give it a try and see how I like it.</div>

This is exactly why I feel dismissal in AF4 has actually been strengthened. In previous systems, dismissing an item was just another way of not dealing with it - it could linger on your list for days. In AF4 you are forced to make a decision either way.<br><br>I started using AF4 yesterday and nothing has been dismissed yet. As soon as I felt like there was a closed list again, items I had been putting off magically got done.</div>

It certainly highlights just how subtle are the energies and dynamics at work here.</div>

<div class="content">Mike-<br><br>If you archive your old items in AF4, you won't be able to tell the ones that were added back from the ones that have just been left undone (dismissed).  All the highlighted items get crossed off on the next pass.  <br><br>I think I like the way AF1 marked dismissed items better.  Highlighted, but only crossed off if you did make a conscious decision to never do it or if you had added it back to the last page.  Otherwise, it remained highlighted to look at during a review.  In other words, it was archived.  But I do like that you are forced to review them shortly after highlighting them.  It is only the marking that I think may be done differently.</div>

<div class="content">Mike,<br><br>I have seen Andreas presentation - which is very clear to me, but anyway - for me this rule creates possibility of endless task rewriting instead of doing something with it (decision) - like you mentioned in your previous reply. I would not feel pressure that I have to do this task (or even small part) - or this it would be dismissed, I will always feel free to skip unwanted tasks, because they can be easily readded. I know it sounds stupid, but I know I will act in that manner - that's why I need so badly Mark's AF.</div>

<div class="content">Greg,<br><br>I hear 'ya.  But the thing is, even under AF1, you could review dismissed tasks and add them back.  And, thinking about it in the widest possible context, you can "cheat" any system if you really want to.<br><br>Why not just take a moment ... a LONG moment ... over each task in the backlog that you skip over and really think about what it means to you, why you put it there in the first place, etc.  I mean, it all comes down to what you want out of life, yes?  No one is holding a gun to your head ... and you don't have to either.  Just put tasks on there that you WILL do because you WANT to do them ... and then remind yourself that you put them there because you wanted to do them.  Then just stare the task down!<br><br>Add a new rule to your AF4 system: "I will never re-add a task unless it can't be done now because of contextual constraints."  That ought to do it ;-)  In fact, Mark suggested (strongly, I thought) that the task be reworded when it was re-added.  I.E.  Chunk it Down when you re-add it.  Can't bring yourself to start doing your taxes?  Re-add the task as: "Buy Tax Software".  Or ... "Pull Last Years Tax File Folder from Cabinet and Read it over".<br><br>You might think about shifting your focus from being controlled by your feelings about a task to being in control of it.  Just a thought or two that might help.</div>

<div class="content">Hmm, I have never felt that AF (any iteration) helps me "defeat my nature".  In fact, I find the opposite -- it helps me "make the most" of my nature.  The AF rules are designed to accommodate human nature and the psychology of getting things done, rather than opposing it.  <br><br>Yes, I have to "make myself" pick up my book and start working through it, and sometimes I just want to start working on whatever it is I just want to do right now.  But I have been learning more and more to just use the system (whichever version it happens to be at the time), because it is such a small price to pay with such a great payback.  <br><br>AF has a tremendous "pull" to it -- I really don't feel myself having to force myself to use the system.  Even when I do just start doing whatever I want without referring to the book, I feel it "calling" me, and I usually heed that call, because it's just so much more FUN (and productive) to use the AF list.<br><br>In the day and a half that I've been using AF4, that feeling of "fun" and "pull" is even stronger than with previous iterations.  <br><br>And one nice thing about AF4 is that you really can just jump directly to whatever is on your mind, by adding it to the end of the open list, and just not having anything else "feel ready to be done".  If you've just started working the Closed List, you can touch one item very quickly to avoid dismissing the whole lot, and skim through the rest (or just flip past them), then go to your Open List, skip through everything to the very end, and behold, you are now working on whatever it was that just popped into your head (or got thrown onto your desk by your boss).  (*)<br><br>Maybe the fact that one is allowed to do this, will bring out the perversity in our natures and completely undermine the whole system.  So far, I don't find that happening.  And I am certainly the kind of person who will naturally gravitate towards doing anything I can to undermine the system.  :-)<br><br><br>(*) The only time the rules prevent you from doing this is when you happen to be working through a bunch of highlighted items on the closed list -- the rules say you must deal with each of them somehow.  If you've got 20 or 30 of them, it can really slow you down for a bit.</div>

<div class="content">Yes renaming task of course helps, but I would like to keep system pure - and I just have a feeling that this is some kind of tweak (so instead of readd you have to rename - this is against rules, because you can readd without changing anything). But ok, I think I will work for a few days and see how it works - but unfortunate I am bit concerned about my nature :)</div>

But sometimes - a week or two later - when the idea might have survived still with AF1, there has been time for the idea to develop more subconsciously and one might think, when the page is facing dismissal, that maybe that it's more than whimsy after all. However whether this applies to the example I was thinking of in my post above, I do not know all these months later.  <<<<br><br>But the tasks remain in AF4.  All you have to do is periodically go back through your book and review the highlighted ones.  Even if they were not copied, they are still there.  The only change from previous AF versions is that they have a line through them.  You can still read what they were.</div>

<div class="content">Laurence,<br><br>In my experience those whimsical ideas generally pop back after a while - it's partly that which lets you know they're something you genuinely want to do, rather than as a result of some fad.<br><br>A time management system is not designed to replace your mind, and contrary to popular belief, it is not against the rules to actually remember something that isn't written down!</div>
