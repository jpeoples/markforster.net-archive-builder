<div class="content">My job requires a lot of writing of documents that may be 20 pages each or more.  Procrastination and resistance around writing has been a lifelong issue for me (you might wonder why I've chosen to work in an area that requires so much writing -- I wonder the same thing, but for the moment, I've got these commitments (& deadlines) & must meet them).  What I have on my Autofocus list for one writing project is several tasks in the pattern of Write (topic), with "topic" being a section of the thing I need to write.  I am finding that I'm just as resistant to doing this on an Autofocus list as on any other list.  I also realize that resistance and procrastination around writing is not uncommon.  I'm wondering how other people deal with this in the context of Autofocus -- any particularly helpful ways you've found to break down writing projects? to phrase them? etc. <br><br>Many thanks!</div>

It sounds as if you would be best using a fixed period of writing in which you have to produce a fixed number of words per day.</div>
