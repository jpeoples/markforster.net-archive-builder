<div class="content">This forum has been great to appreciate how common the problems are that many of us have with task/time management, not to mention what seems to be endemic procrastination.<br><br>I especially appreciate the comment many have made about how many different systems, tools, techniques  etc they have tried, to little or no avail.  The practical feedback and tips are invaluable, provided one doesn't attempt to try all of them.  As I've mentioned previously, one has to find the approach that suits one's own perceived needs.  AF is especially suitable for tweaking, provided you don't stray away too far from the core principles - Mark's feedback keeps pulling us back into line by reminding us of them!<br><br>In the couple of weeks of this beta, my productivity has got much betta (dreadful, I know, couldn't resist it) during a fortnight which has seen me prepare for a one month assignment in Zambia, fly to South Africa to mix some business with pleasure, then fly on to Zambia where I am now; five flights have given me time and occasion to work on and think about AF.<br><br>I have already modified AF more than once and have now returned to a paper list IN ADDITION to still using OneNote which integrates nicely with Outlook which is where my time-bound stuff and reminder s reside.  I found that my use of three highlighters is too distracting, so just cross out completed items with a straight line (cancelled, rubbish items get a wavy line), so that Defer To Do Later (items which cannot be done while I am away from the UK) are in yellow and the Dismissed For Review Later items in pink.<br><br>What time interval are others using to review Dismissed items?  I'm starting off with one week and will see how it goes.<br><br>I'm still using an A5 notebook (front for work, upside down from the back for personal) and will probably stick with this even when not travelling or away.  I've always thought A4 is too big, for office and travel.<br><br>Ultimately, I want to get one of the just-announced Asus Tablet NetBooks with 8.9" screen (nice size for ageing eyes and for use in cattle class on flights) and will then write everything on it, without any attempt to deploy handwriting recognition.  This model should be available from March or April.<br><br></div>
