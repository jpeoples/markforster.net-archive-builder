<div class="content">Mason Curry's book, Daily Rituals, has many examples of morning routines of well known authors and artists. One I like is author P.G. Woodhouse stepping out onto the back porch for the "daily dozen" series of excersises then eating, reading and going for a walk before writing.</div>
