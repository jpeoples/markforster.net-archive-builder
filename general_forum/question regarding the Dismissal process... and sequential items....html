<div class="content">as a newbie trying to get my head around the the dismissal process...<br><br>as the owner (or renting-from-the-bank type of owner) of an old house there are PLENTY of DIY renovations to be done... pergola... wood oven... finish off laundry... finish off bathroom... new kitchen (including the replacement of the complete flooring, cupboards etc etc)... etc... etc... etc<br><br>now... these items have to be squeezed in on ever too short weekends and all too infrequent holidays... and as they are all tasks that are not simpley ones which one wakes up on Saturday morning... reads through the list and says... OK... I will rip out the kitchen floor today... or build 8 individually sized custom doors for the laundry to finish it off... as they are ALL not things that may be necessarily finished in a few hours... many may take several weeks or longer to be able to be classed as complete... <br><br>so... if I have all these items on my HOME list... and I read over the list and nothing stands out as do-able for that day... and then the same happens again... and again... according to my reading of AF and the Dismissal "rules" they are to be removed from the list<br><br>but... then they are not "out there", as-it-were, as a reminder of where they stand in the overall status of the home renovations... <br><br>and also... sort of related to this...<br><br>most of the home reno type of tasks... like all building related tasks... are sequential... footings first... then the floor... then the walls... then the roof... with all of the associated in-between or sub sequences for each of the sequences... and in most cases cannot be deviated from... roof without the walls first...? mmmm... not so sure  :-)<br><br>how can one easily... especially in a paper based version of AF... take into account and manage these sequential type list items ??<br><br>cheers from Oz</div>

<div class="content">Hi Trevor,<br><br>This is just my personal experience with doing the same kind of major home renovation that you are doing using Autofocus as well for a number of months.  <br><br>The one thing I wouldn't do is to put all of your projects on the list, because you will find that you may start many projects - deconstructing etc. but not having the time to finish in a reasonable time frame because you're busy deconstructing (the first step) something else.  <br><br>What worked better for me was scheduling everything that had to do with these projects except for the ones that were big jobs that I kind of dreaded and didn't have a real need to complete in a certain time frame (like removing stipple from the ceiling or glued down mdf from the floor - ugh!).  Basically anything I could work 'little and often' on without making a huge mess.  I used AF condensed for this and it worked the best for me of all the methods.<br><br>I would imagine you could just tackle one project at a time using the list.  I just never found for myself that I made progress as fast as I could have with scheduling it.  <br><br>I prefer Mark's ideas around "current initiative" for reno projects.  It worked better for me to focus on doing something on a particular project (only one at a time) every day as soon as I got home (like ripping up carpet) or picking stuff up on my way home from work and then a big push to do the major time consuming parts on the weekends to finish it off.<br><br>I should say however, that using Autofocus to start working on these projects was literally a life-saver because it got me started and I did make quite a lot of progress using it (the only problem was that I was left with a lot of stuff ripped up but not finished).  The AF method reduced the overwhelmed feeling that I had when looking at everything I had to do that had paralyzed me into not doing anything at all.</div>
