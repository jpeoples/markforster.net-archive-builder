<div class="content">Borrowing from a comments by Scott in Mark's post "Which is the Best System?"  <br><br>He shares this interesting picture:<br><a href="http://www.moehrbetter.com/uploads/8/9/0/3/890360/index_card_system.pdf" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.moehrbetter.com/uploads/8/9/0/3/890360/index_card_system.pdf</a><br><br>The typical use is for cards to hold details which are called out by name from an FVP-style master notebook.  This organisation has something to do with implementing systems theory ideas in a non-digital medium.<br><br><a href="http://blog.cabreraresearch.org/solving-st" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://blog.cabreraresearch.org/solving-st</a><br><br>Quoting Scott:<br><<1) I now keep a stack of blank index cards on top of my sticky notes. I don't use stickies much anymore, and I'm much happier. I found I was putting things on stickies to remind me of things that were on my lists, lol. So, when something new comes in where I would have reached for a sticky, I now see the index cards. It broke the pattern. Instead of a random sticky, I now either make a new project card, or add the new task/info to an existing card, or add it to my FVP notebook. Funnel things towards you, instead of continually spreading out, right? :)<br><br>2) The die has six sides (obviously). Whichever side is up is what I'm working on now. It's about being more intentional. The sides I have are:<br>- Billable (freelance)<br>- Project (personal, but building something tangible)<br>- Connect (reach out to actual people, to maintain or build relationships)<br>- Daily mese-en-place ("everything in it's place", so cleaning up, or working on systems)<br>- Wandering (conscious serendipity, but choosing to actually do it, and then stop)<br>- Rest & Recharge (I flip it to that side at the end of the day, and it "closes the shop")<br><br>I have fallen in love with using physical objects to help manage my work. I've used so many digital tools, and still do, but there is something about writing and doodling by hand, and moving objects around. It really engages me with the work, and reduces the resistance to almost nil. For task management, I like paper. For collecting reference and doing serious writing, it's digital.<br>>></div>

<div class="content">As a family systems therapist, I'm quite intrigued by his use of systems theory to guide his workflow. I've reached out to him - curious if he'll respond.</div>

<div class="content">I'm flattered by your splitting my ideas off into a separate thread! <br><br>I'm also intrigued by your interest in systems thinking. I'm still a neophyte in this area, but it's been fun learning about formal, well-developed concepts and realizing that I had frequently done something similar on my own. <br><br>I think the most relevant area to this group is that software is a terrific help for managing knowledge work, but so is paper and other physical objects. As Mark often alludes, do you need more than the simplest approach that helps you get the job done? Does your tool or method work for you? Then use it! There's no shame in low-tech solutions.</div>
