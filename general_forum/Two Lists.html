<div class="content">For some time I've been thinking that the best productivity system would include simply a master task list and a daily task list. I couldn't get it to work though. SF is the answer. Master list in left column/today's actions on the right. The missing piece was the AF-like rules that govern each. <br><br>As with many great things, SF is so simple, I wonder how noone created it before. It seems so obvious. I think I am finally done tinkering with systems and ready to focus on getting stuff done. Thanks Mark!</div>

<div class="content">Fancy that ! @Scott I thought exactly that. For years I use the master and daily list technic but SF is much better. There is no double beam, no loose of time. It is just incredible. I admit at the beginning it was hard for me but now it s ok and it goes very very fast. I love it.</div>

<div class="content">I view TT the way I use it as a variant of a master list and daily list type of system.  It works for people who have a must do type of need. <br><br>Gerry</div>
