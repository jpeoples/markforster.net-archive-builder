<div class="content">Just wondered what everyone is using?  Do you keep work and home in one notebook or separate ones? Are they different notebooks or similar?</div>

<div class="content">Moleskine, index card sized.  I could imagine there's better available, but not that I've seen.  It fits in my pocket and doesn't fall apart.</div>

<div class="content">+JMJ+<br><br>I use AF only at home, work is too fast paced for it.  I use 3"x5" top-spiral notebooks from Walmart with a faux-leather cover from Staples.  Tough and inexpensive, always in my pocket.</div>

<div class="content">A5 with spiral wire spine - easy to remove unwanted pages.<br><br>I also use an A4 spiral wire spine for journalling etc, and for any "Dreams" exercises.</div>

<div class="content">I use a thin pocket notebook with subtle graph/quad/square ruled lines. Either Field Notes or Moleskine Cahier. I use ink color to tag Home vs Work contexts, but these tasks are all interleaved throughout the list, all in the same notebook.</div>

<div class="content">HTC Desire smartphone with Google Tasks. I put a task entitled "BREAK" every 25 items or so to delineate a 'page' for AF and process them accordingly. 2 lists: "Inbox" for everything captured, "Dismissed" for you know what. After I begin a new 'page' I clear completed tasks to make review simpler. I always have my phone with me and always have an immediate backup of my list on any computer within reach.</div>

<div class="content">Loose-Leaf in a cheap, thin notebook with re-cycled A4 paper, but three-hole punch.  OmniFocus sync with iPad and iPhone for certain items (or for capture) when I feel like it, or want to use its great reminder features, or plan a project digitally.  <br>I use an Excel form for AF sheets to get it like I want, but not so expensive with a laser printer.  Loose-Leaf gives me freedom to add/remove/move, etc.  Temporary context or project sheets, etc. can also be interspersed at will (and temporarily).</div>

<div class="content">I use a ruled moleskine. It irritates me terribly though how in Waterstones and other outlets, they have a whole stack of moleskine wellbeing, dog journals and peanuts anniversary journals, but are usually out of stock of the plain black ruled notebook - which would probably be their bestseller if they put a few more on the shelf. Somebody needs to have a word with their merchandisers.</div>

<div class="content">Lately I've been using some lined pocket journals made by DiVOGA, which I believe is Office Max's house stationery brand. They're about 5x7" with 35 lines/page. Not as durable as a Moleskine but good enough considering how quickly I'm using them (the current one was started on 11/11/11 and will probably be filled before mid-March; the previous one was filled in about 3 months), and the price was right (I stocked up when they were on clearance for $2.50). The paper *seems* thin but it holds up to fountain pen ink quite well.</div>

<div class="content">My favorite by far is the X-47 organizer from Germany. The start-up cost is high, but replacement inserts are economical. I work from both an office and home setting and have been separating home and work tasks for about 6 months. For me this works much better.<br><br>With the X-47, I can carry 2 inserts for my task lists ( home and office) and one calendar insert. I just started this year with the Time Circles weekly calendar and I really like it. With the way the inserts are made they are very flat and have more writing room than a bound book, spiral notebook or binder. Currently I use the A6 size ( paper 3.86 x 5.71 inches.) My current  X47 is about ½ inch thick with all my inserts and note cards in the pockets.  Fits in my pocket or bag very well.</div>

<div class="content">Was using loose leaf paper, I had some very nice letter size plain paper and used that up.  I've now changed over to my favourite type of notepad, a Rhodia Webnotebook.  They come in A5 or A6 and are similar to Moleskine (back cover pocket, elastic closure) but with much better paper.  Covers are nice, come in orange or black.  Paper is 90gsm, very smooth, in an ivory/off-white shade and takes fountain pen ink beautifully.  Can be had plain, lined or dot gridded.  Mine is the A5, plain pages with an orange cover - orange so it stands out and helps me not forget it!</div>
