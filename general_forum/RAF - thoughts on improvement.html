<div class="content">I have to admit that in the beginning, I didn't like RAF very much. It was too much AF2, and AF2 never worked for me at all.<br><br>But if one thing is true, it's that you have to work some time with a system - and QUITE some time! - to know how it works for you. First you have to really wrap your head around how it works, second you have to pass through an eventual "it-works-great-because-its-new-and-so-I'm-very-motivated"-stage... and not before you reach a time when you *no longer think about HOW* you manage things, you simply manage them: then you're there.<br><br>And from here, I have to admit I have made my peace with RAF. It works. Not perfect, but good enough. Which means: Better than all the other systems I tried. I'm more in touch with my subconscious. No bunch of lists, half of them orphaned graveyards of maybe... someday... never tasks: Just one that is constantly moving forward. No deciding upfront where to jot it down: There's only one place available - the end of the list. And so on. We've discussed this happily all over this forum.<br><br>But... still... as Mark has mentioned he is working on RRAF, I started meta-thinking again. What are the weaknesses of the current system? The big one is that you hardly get to the pages in the middle. You start at the end, at some point jump to the beginning, working forward... and at least I always get thrown back very soon. So, a task gets done either immediately - or very late, hopefully short before it's due, or when the "line of doom" strikes...<br><br>What to do? Just some ideas:<br><br>PICK WALKING: What I am doing from time to time is to have a first walk-through in the morning from the beginning to the end of the list (this is what RAF achieved for me: I read the whole list every day. Which helps a lot. I never arrived at doing so with AF1, for some reason I still don't know.), and I not only read, I pick things that look like I could either get done in minutes or at least touch for a short time. I do so when I am not in a hurry the day, and this routine throws at least some things forward.<br><br>However, this is for short actions only. Otherwise, it would be noon before I reach the end. And I don't dismiss anything. I just go through the pages and pick what lifts its head.<br><br>I have to admit that in the beginning, I didn't like RAF very much.

And I don't dismiss anything. I just go through the pages and pick what lifts its head.<br><br>URGENCY RUN: This is something I tried several times, but not long enough. Imagine following classical AF1, with the only addition that whenever I open a new page (having finished a last page), I go from where I am page by page to the end, marking all tasks that have become URGENT. When I reach the end, I go backwards and complete these urgent tasks one by one until I am on my current page again.<br><br>The point here is not to look for what „stands out“, but what is URGENT. And *urgent* means: *It will cause bad consequences if not done today.* In my list, there are normally not more than 2 or 3 of those tasks. So I won’t miss urgent tasks while working my way through the list page by page.<br><br>(I did something similar with my „REV AF“, only that I went backwards through the pages instead of forward as AF1 demanded. This going backwards resulted in the habit that once I reached the first active page and jumped back to the end, I tended to stay there for days... And I didn’t make the difference between „urgent“ and „standing out“ - which is crucial, I think.)<br><br>One might think of another signal to do the urgency run, but I haven’t come up with another idea that „another page got filled“.<br><br>META TASKS: Sometimes, when I read through my list in the morning, I notice some patterns. For example, that there are a lot of letters to write. Or a lot of things to buy. When I notice this, I add „meta tasks“ like:<br>- Write all letters that are due!<br>- Define a day to go to town and make a shopping list.<br><br>In a way, I suggest myself to batch similar things. This way, when this meta task stands out, I follow „horizontal threads“ through the list - from „letter to insurance“ to „letter to X“ and so on - and get through the middle again!<br><br>I try to avoid meta tasks as much as possible (because actually, these are tasks that exist only because of the system, so they have to be considered overhead), but sometimes they are useful. I don’t *search* for patterns, I try just to be open for them. And when a thought like „hey, a lot of things concerning the garden are on the list, maybe I should take care of them?“ comes up, it feels natural to jot it down.<br><br>Enough for today...</div>

<div class="content">Andreas,<br><br>Before RAF came out, and I was completely frustrated with AF2, I described my "tweak" in which I scanned the list in the morning, picked off the "hot" items and made an index card with "Thing I Must Do Today" on it.  It works.<br><br>As to "meta tasks", those tend to be standing tasks for me so I keep seperate pages for them and move items there as I go or in my morning scan.  It also works.<br><br></div>
