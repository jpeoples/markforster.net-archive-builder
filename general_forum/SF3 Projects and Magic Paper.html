<div class="content">[this is a refined consolidation of a blog comment which seemed off topic there]<br><br>With projects that contain a list of tasks that evolves over time and thought, and 'initiatives' which for me, are more vague groupings of ideas/tasks/considerations, I find that 'outside lists' end up being places where items which have a strong resistance to doing can hide themselves, since there are no rules to process/dismiss/focus on them and gain the benefits of the main normal flow of the system. For me, the off-list accounting for these items causes the system to break down because there is a different set of rules there (no rules).<br><br>The challenge (for me at least) here is that either every item on the separate project list needs to be duplicated onto the main list and the ProjectX list at the time they are thought of (possibly using shorthand mention to each item individually) or a call to action of ProjectX Task1 -> WNL  . This being a shorthand to do Task1 and when done, check the projectX [Whats Next] List for what to do next.  What happens repeatedly to me is that the ProjextX List is a list bucket where things can go to hideout, as additional ProjectX related ideas/tasks can be added and then chosen to be the What's Next (the non resistive ones), and the resistive items on this offbook ProjectX List hide.  It also can mask and hide when you dont want it to the amount of things you have on your already input plate.<br><br>Does anyone have thoughts on an approach that is a mirror of the main benefits of the main sf3 list on these outside lists? Maybe a shorter split horizontally page approach where there are only 5 rows for col1 and col2?<br><br>Filtering/Focusing vs main list processing<br><br>For myself, sometimes I want to decide to heavily focus on a project or (maybe two) specifically.  This allows for a often needed 'forget the world' big push and jump in completion in an important area.  In this case, all the other items on this list are just distractions pulling away from this.  Now for a more balanced and everyday processing, the SF3 main list seems to work very well in getting things both started and completed.<br><br>Having both the time based entry and filling up of pages/columns as a limiter and task selector/behavior modifier along with a way to see 'All of ProjectX' for thought, planning and actioning to me seems as the primary benefit for a electronic or yet to be discovered paper implementation.<br><br>On a related note, what could a solution look like to this electronically where lists and project/sublists can be merged/managed virtually in the two ways for their purpose? To keep things simple, I'll rephrase this as : "What could SF3 look like if you had magic virtual paper and a magic notebook that can do whatever you want and be displayed in any and multiple formats?<br>Think of pages that could dynamically expand, replicate, filter and shrink, where project lists could be inserted inline as an example.<br><br>Keeping the paper paradigm here I think will help so it is easy to understand in any discussion and keeps it simple and focused even though there are many non paper/page paradigms possible.<br><br>My thoughts here are possibly an inlining of sublists/pages/parts of pages, maybe with different # (much less) of lines per inlined virtual page. So projects or other initiative lists could gain from the filling/dismissal incentives.<br><br>Keeping it simple is still a major requirement - but I think something that handles these two levels/views of tasks/activities is important.<br><br>BTW- I have and use "magic paper" - a tabletpc, and writing (inking) is natural and I feel can give the best of paper and electronic. It really works great, and with prices dropping and selection in the tablet space increasing exponentially right now, I see this not just as a limited to geeks possibility for broad use in near future.  I've been developing simple list/task software for tablet/pen focused devices, much applies to standard keyboard entry as well (just not as efficient and doesnt feel the same).  I'll post images of any development work here for others to see a virtual AF/SF system if interested. <br><br>Does any of the above seem like a common area which you can relate to or am I off in my own in crazytown?</div>

<div class="content">About stuff hiding in other lists, I totally agree this is a small problem. For a while I was doing SFv2 over these other lists. It worked okay, but SFv3 seems to flow much better and I don't see a good way to marry SFv3 effectively with such lists other than how Mark is doing. So what I'm at for now:<br><br>all these old lists are treated as dismissed pages that I review regularly for things to add in to SFv3 as individual tasks. In SF I have tasks written as "task -> project" to remind me that I should go back to the project if I finish the current task. But I must also do the reviews so I miss nothing.</div>

<div class="content">Alan - Thanks for giving more detail on this. <br><br>As I've went through this again, the virtual paper paradigm provides what I think is a clear solution to looking and working on tasks on there own, and as part of projects/groups.  Here is my theory:<br><br>For SuperFocus3 (and probably most of the other AF based methods)<br><br>-Time of entry and time of action are the principle mechanical drivers of the system.<br>-DWM used a calendar/specific actual passing time as the constraint<br>-SF3 and the other AF uses the page or closed list as the constraint<br><br>One attribute of SF3 that I think makes it unique is the visibility of whats on your current page.  Seeing Col2 for urgent and ongoing is always in front of you. This both drives and puts mind at ease.<br><br>So, following this theory the virtual paper way of handling having these dual views, is to have time of entry drive where an item goes on the list, same as it does with standard SF3 AND for this item to also be in the time of entry ordered list on the virtual project page.  So one entry, is on two virtual pages. Its visually duplicated onto two pages for free.<br><br>This handles being able to see the Project View as a whole with all tasks entered, started, completed, dismissed - which I think is really important when working on many tasks for the project.<br><br>By putting in Col2 - ProjectX DoNextThing until X complete, projectX will be worked on until complete.  As per the rules, you would pick something from projectX to do and this would be on col2, when done, the next page col2 gets ProjectX DoNextThing until X complete.<br><br>I think this apporach is good for the little and often mainline approach.<br><br>Just as a clarification here, there would be only 1 item that is on 2 virtual pages.  If you are working (focused in) on the project virtual page - any new item entered here will also show up on the main SF3 page it would as if it was not part of a project - either on col 1 or col 2 as rules state.<br><br>The only thing left to handle is how can the same system be used when you want to be hyperfocusing/working on one or two projects exclusively?  It would be great to get the same SF3 mechanisms and benefits but constrained to these focused chosen projects <br><br>And maybe combining in some of the rest of the main lists items somehow to keep some 'easy' stuff available to jump to for a productive 'break', with the pull being the same as how SF3 does but just for the benefit of these chosen projects - at expense of everything else.<br><br>I'm drawing a blank on how to handle this last part, any ideas?<br><br>For me, I think the power of filtering in / out things based on a choice that only needs to be made once upfront (for one day as example)- which then hides/shows only things inline with that choice (ie - spend time today on projectX and projectY/ignore rest) is central to controlling distraction.<br><br>I'm sure others have the same distractability/hyperfocus abilities that are both a blessing and a curse :-). Kind of like, hey the system is great because I don't forget or lose things, but damn, there are so many things that I put down a day ago that I don't want to be distracted by (see) right now.<br><br>Any input appreciated, especially if you have experience with going back and forth between paper/electronic for what the key drivers are for you.</div>
