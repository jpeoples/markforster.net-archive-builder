<div class="content">I notice resistance when I switch between the 2,  Somehow if I am doing x then doing y its easier to do z, rather than doing x desking a doing y desking b etc.  So what I am going to trial this week is my new "Do vs Desk Designator": an orange circle, if truth be told ! on the lhs or rhs.  This applies to the one-off task list in DIT so might not be of use if you are using a different system.  Does anyone else think this might be useful of can you think of a better way<br>Mrs M (can hardly be Mrs MF!)</div>

<div class="content">Mrs M:<br><br>I'm having trouble understanding what you are proposing here. What does the orange circle do?</div>

<div class="content">Alan:<br><br>I wondered that too, but in the end I decided it meant the same as "shelving", except that instead of putting the stuff you don't want to do on a shelf somewhere out of sight, you put it in a pile on your desk.</div>

<div class="content">Desk tasks are anything I do at my desk.  PC jobs, email, cards. <br>Doing jobs are nipping out for something, cooking, i,e more menial. Clearing a cupboard, hanging the washing anything like that<br>I find it easier to do one "desking" job after another, or one "doing" task after another<br>but switching from tax return to weeding to emailing a friend to putting a shelf up makes no sense at all, at least to me. <br>I need a marker so when I do SS I can see at a glance and if I am on a roll physically I keep going with that or on a roll at my desk I can keep going with that.  placing a diffferent marker at the side of the task has helped this - I will keep going with that for a while and see how i get on.</div>

<div class="content">I’d be tempted to list them separately in the first place. Much easier to distinguish for the purposes of batch processing.</div>
