<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>I have commented here that I used GTD for quite some time and for the most part, found it an outstanding system for capturing and maintaining all of one's open loops.  I have seen you make a few comments here and there about how complex GTD is and that maintaining all of those lists is cumbersome.  I would like to ask you if you ever tried to work with the GTD model and if you could provide a comprehensive assessment of the GTD approach versus your outstanding DIT approach.  I find DIT to be very good to say the least.  The reason I am asking is that GTD has become a world-wide phenomenon.  There is even a world GTD conference that is going ot be held in San Francisco.  If one googles GTD, one can find literally thousands of blogs full of testimonials on how GTD is THE  best time management system ever.  Major corporations across the USA and the world (I saw a post on how a major company in India has adopted GTD for all of its employees) have had training sessions on GTD.  I know that one of the major issues with GTD, at least the one I had, was the ever-growing next actions list with seemingly no end in site.  It was discouraging.  <br><br>So, Mark...would you please compare and contrast GTD and DIT and how would you convince people that DIT is the way to go and the world-wide, almost cult-like status of GTD is not the way to go.  I am asking because I am using DIT, but am surrounded by many who still use GTD.<br><br>Thanks,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Dear David<br><br>Good question!<br><br>I'm not sure I can give an answer in the detail which you are asking for. I only used GTD for a short period and found that I didn't get on with it at all - though I did pick up some useful points - so I'm probably not the best qualified person to answer. <br><br>You will find a lot of discussion on the web about about DIT v. GTD. Googling "DIT versus GTD" returns a large number of hits - so I suggest you have a read through some of them as many of them will be written by people who have given both systems a serious try.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>I would be very interested in hearing exactly why you could not get GTD to work.  <br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Dear David<br><br>Well, it would have been getting on for ten years ago now, so I can't remember the details. But I'm pretty sure that, after a lot of very complicated shuffling of projects and tasks, I ended up with the same problem that I had when I started.<br><br>That problem was that the number of things I put on my list to do kept growing faster than I was able to action them. The things that did get actioned were the easy things, while the things that would have made a real difference got put off.</div>
