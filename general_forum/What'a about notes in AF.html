<div class="content">1) i have a lot of information coming from clients about projects. I use Mark method to put all my task in AF but how do you treat notes. Do you put them into AF treating them like a task one after the others or do you put them at the end of your note book ? Ho do you do ? <br><br>2) About projects i have a lot of projetcts wich need to be followed ie historical reports, strategy, where do you put them apart in a folder or inside your note book ?<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Jupiter:<br><br>AF is a task management system, not a project management system. So if you have notes or other details about projects then those need to be kept separately. How you do it is up to you.</div>

<div class="content">I agree completely. Notes have to be in another place. But I reserve some pages in my AF-Notebook for notes just because I'm carrying this book always with me an so no idea or note cant get lost.</div>

<div class="content">I don't do project management of the sort that Project Managers do... but here's what I use:<br><br>1) Journler (Mac only, a competitor to OneNote and possibly OmniFocus, though I'm not all that familiar with either of those applications) for just about all electronic notes, jottings from meetings, notes to myself.<br>2) iCal for timed reminders of things to add to my AF list and other appointments.<br>3) a pocket moleskine journal when I'm out and about.  Yes, this means that I'm carrying two 5"x7" notebooks around for the time being... my journal is almost full, though, and will be replaced with something smaller so I'm carrying less.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jupiter, I keep my notes seperate to my AF list. I use a moleskine notebook and find that the pocket at the back is useful for keeping note paper in that can be used when needed. I then toss the note into my inbox for processing. I think it's more helpful to keep notes by topic in a relevant project or reference folder -  if the notes are for future reference I need to be able to find  them rather than flicking through half a notebook containing random ideas!</div>

<div class="content">I attend (and run) a lot of meetings, and someone has to capture the minutes and the action items.  Often it's me.  I usually write those up in an email which I send out at the end of the meeting, to all the participants and all the need-to-knows.<br><br>While taking the minutes, if I myself get an action item, I'll add it to my AF list right then.<br><br>If I don't have time to do it right then, then I'll scan the action items after the meeting, and copy mine to the AF list.  Also, if someone else has action items but I need to track their progress for some reason, I'll add that to AF too ("follow up with Mike on the new XSL").<br><br>This is all very low overhead, and works very well.  It works well even if the meeting is just a 1-on-1, or just my own personal project-organization session.<br><br>If I'm not sure if something is an action item or just a "note", I'll add it to AF and let AF decide.  :-)</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br>That's a very good example of how flexible AF is.</div>

<div class="content">Great illustration Seraphim - and I like the fact that you have meetings with yourself too!</div>

<div class="content">I've started the practice of using a notebook for AF as follows:<br>Keep all AF items on the right page.<br>Keep the left page for notes, often related to the items on the right page.<br>Not sure if I will keep doing that but it also satisfies my desire to start my AF items listing on a clean page every time I start a new page and not be writing on the back of page.</div>

<div class="content">@ Christine - Yes, my name implies that I am a plural singularity, as some of my more grammatically-strict friends tell me.  As such, it makes meetings with myself more interesting.  :-)</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim, <br><br>I've searched a bit but wasn't successful in finding one.... is there a description of "your system" on the forum?  -- Home/work lists? one notebook, style of note book... etc?   <br><br>Just curious... <br><br>Thanks for sharing...<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Mary,<br><br>I'm using "standard" Autofocus.  I have two notebooks, one for work, one for personal.  Just regular cheap stitch-bound notebooks with about 100 pages each.  For work I like using a graph-paper format, for home I use a college-ruled book.<br><br>I think the only "exception" that I make to the rules is when I have a sudden batch of very urgent tasks ("must do today").  In that case, I add the tasks to the last active page, as usual, but then make that page my "active" page and start working it as normal.  The only rule I am breaking by doing this is not going through the pages sequentially, but jumping straight to the last page.  <br><br>Otherwise I just use standard AF.<br><br>Did that answer your question?  Maybe I misunderstood what you were trying to ask.</div>

<div class="content">Thank you so much for your thorough response. I appreciate your time.  You and Christine B and Jacueline have my nomination for AF MVPs.... Mark--you're up for MVC(most valuable coach), of course!!  Thanks again, to one and all.  Mark AF is a simply wonderful tool. Thank you for sharing it so freely. <br><br>~ms</div>
