<div class="content">Avrum,<br><br>Thanks for the link.<br><br>I had just read the book and feel it could be life changing. I already feel I am over the compulsion to write down every single to-do for fear I may forget it or not do it at the best time. <br><br>It also struck me that Time Surfing + Dreams could be a powerful combination. They seem to complement one another very well. For instance, I can see the third aspect of breathers (p.62) being all the more efficacious with a strong vision behind them, and a "pull" methodology/mindset. <br><br>So I think I'm going to put together a program/timetable that builds on the step by step course at the end of Dreams to incorporate the learning points, exercises and assignments in Loomans and see what happens!<br><br>IanS</div>
