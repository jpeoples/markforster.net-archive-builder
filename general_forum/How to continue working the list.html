<div class="content">I'm a newbie with AF1. I stopped yesterday at item X. Now starting work today, should I read through all the items on the same page and then go one by one. Or I continue working the next item after X?</div>

<div class="content">Most of us here are using AF4. With AF4, you just carry on where you left off.<br><br>Rather than think of a bookmark for your list, it may help to think of the list as a bookmark for your life.</div>

<div class="content">It's clear. I mean I start from the same point I left. The question is should I start from re-reading the whole page or the next item after the item I stopped at?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Eugene,<br><br>Good question!  <br><br>I've only worked with AF1 and never kept a record of where I stopped on the page (ie. the last item worked on), only what page I left off on.  I don't think I would have known which item I left off doing, so I think the answer for me when doing AF1 was to start off again at the top of the page you left off on.  <br><br>FWIW, I usually started the day on the page AFTER the page I worked on the night before (as long as I'd done something on it).  ie. I would go quickly through the page in the evening from the last task done, nothing remaining stood out, I would move the page marker to the next page and leave the list for the remainder of the day and start on the new page in the morning (which is starting from the last item left, I guess).  <br><br>In AF1, it likely shouldn't really matter if you start in the middle of the page or the top because you're circling around the page multiple times?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Steve, <br><br>No, I'm not using AF right now, but may go back to using it in January.  I don't know, there's something else I've been playing around with that's a bit more project based.  <br><br>In the last few months, I haven't had a lot of discretionary time.  It's been one thing right after the other of really big, time consuming projects and urgent "we need this by midnight" or "oops changed our minds, we need to split the year into two periods - can we get that in 5 hours?" requests.  Sure... LOL  <br><br>Even AF cannot withstand the demands of a bunch of lawyers and accountants working together plotting world domination.<br><br>I just don't think it's a good idea to work a system like AF unless you have at least a few hours a day - every day - to work through it properly.<br><br>How about you?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline,<br><br>Your post is intriguing.  I have many colleagues that use GTD and state that if one is as busy as they are -- and in the manner in which you described -- then GTD works better in an environment like that.  They are aware of Autofocus, but state almost what you have said -- one must have considerable discretionary time to make this work well.  If you do not have that -- then it would be best to follow the GTD approach where the decision-making is done upfront, with projects and next actions developed accordingly.  Hmmm....really interesting....thanks for sharing your comments on this.<br><br>Mark and All, what do you think about this characterization?  I am not saying at all that I agree with my GTD colleagues....but this can develop into a good discussion!<br><br>Jacqueline, I do hope you are well.  Best wishes.<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">If you have little discretionary time isn't a system with low overhead like AF good?  The question becomes can you keep up with your work.  As the AF list grows or shrinks you can see how you are doing.  In DIT we had the audit process to assess this.  If you are in a busy patch then its fair enough that you fall behind however if your busy patch is permanent what are going to do.  Work more hours (hello burnout), work more efficiently (hello time management system) or cut work out.  The latter is difficult when you are under pressure and more so when your boss is difficult.  You've got to choose priorities (ie what you'll do in the next few days) and agree with stakeholders.  Alternatively list everything and divide between must do, should do and could do.  I can tell you all what won't help.  Spending hours researching and choosing a new time management system, especially GTD.  By the time you've listed your 100 open loops and the next actions you'll certainly feel swamped.  <br><br>Which brings me to another issue (sorry if I am repeating a recent post), the idea that a project can be reduced to quick actions like call peter, meet susie, book room etc.  Some projects require you to think what needs to be done which takes time when you haven't done it before and you don't know what to do next.  Some projects just require hours of hard slog and you've just got to face it.  Don't be seduced by thinking there is an easy way, sometimes there isn't.</div>

<div class="content">Hi David and MOK,<br><br>Thanks David, all is well and I hope everything is going great for you!<br><br>This was a weird situation that I've never really been in before - or at least not to this degree.  As you guys know, I work a full-time job at the university and do consulting work as well.  I've been able to juggle both all year using AF but in September, I decided that I really wanted to max out my income for the year via the consulting work (I get paid base salary for my regular 40 hour/week job, so I have no incentive to work OT there).  :-)<br><br>It's an odd situation because at the time, I could basically put in as much time as I wanted and whatever I couldn't do or didn't have the time to do would get farmed out to outside tax consultants and lawyers.  (One lawyer billed 20 hours in a single day, imagine that!)  LOL  So I was working pretty much solely on priority, with that being my #1 (actually only) priority.  Everything else was noise (except my kids, of course).  <br><br>The consulting work is discrete project based, so I don't really have multiple things to juggle and since it's work I've done before, like MOK said, it's just slogging through the stuff.  And the deadlines are very clear - a court date here, a tax filing there.  And then of course, there's the bizarre collaborations between lawyers and accountants that occur where decisions are made to go one way or another - all at the last minute, and pretty much completely out of my control.  It's almost no different than being an EMS worker and responding to the latest emergency - which, as I think we discussed before, a system like AF isn't appropriate for.  <br><br>Sure I put in a lot of 16 hour days, but it was a good experience because there was a definite end in sight and it's work I enjoy for people that appreciate it.  Oh, and the money helps. :-)  Having said that, thank god that business is over until it starts up again in January!<br><br>Re. the project based approach - believe me, it's nothing fancy.  I've just been listing each project (based on my goals) on a separate sheet with a bunch of stuff to do for each one, kind of like contexts in GTD I guess.  That way I'm not losing sight of my goals.  Then I just work on each one via a standing out method.  With the little stuff that I have a problem with (what Knaus calls maintenance procrastination items), they have their own section.  That's just because I didn't really realize before that I don't do that stuff (like cleaning or getting the oil changed in the car) because I filter it out as unimportant.  But I was doing a lot more of that kind of thing with AF - too much for my own comfort!  :-)  So I want to spend a bit of time on that stuff, but not to the exclusion of things that I know will make more of a difference.<br><br>In January, I'm moving to semi-retirement, so we'll see how the method holds up or if I go back to pure AF (v.1).   I know there's an aversion here to working based on previously determined priority, but I can't help it, I've done it for so many years that I feel discombobulated if I don't do that - like I'm doing something wrong.  And it's worked so well for me that I hate trying to fix something that isn't broken.<br><br>Sorry if that was TMI, and if it sounds even more appalling than my 2 book method (which actually worked really well too) but I don't use methods of working to make other people happy.  David, you're probably sorry you asked.  LOL</div>

<div class="content">I'm actually a bit puzzled about what Jacqueline says about not being able to work AF unless one has lots of discretionary time. All time is discretionary unless one has no choice at all about what to do. So being in a meeting isn't discretionary time and a true emergency isn't discretionary time but just about everything else (in an office context) is. So if you have two urgent reports to get ready by close of play, then that is still discretionary time because you still have to use your discretion about which report to work on first and what other tasks need to be done as well as the two reports in the time frame.<br><br>I find AF4 extremely powerful in situations where I only have a short time to do a lot of work. If one is floundering, the solution is not to abandon the system but to focus it. You do that by cutting everything out of your list which isn't essential to the goals which you are currently working on.</div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline<br><br>I would see your project lists as checklists.  They aren't GTD context lists which are groups of actions based on where you are or the apparatus you would use for the actions.  I'm also giving myself a gold star for being a pedant.

<div class="content">I am not at all unhappy that I asked you, Jacqueline!  Your response was intriguing.  I certainly see myself a lot in the way you have described your consulting work.  The key question is if AF4 would work well in this type of situation.  Mark, you say that "If one is floundering, the solution is not to abandon the system but to focus it. You do that by cutting everything out of your list which isn't essential to the goals which you are currently working on".  This sounds exactly what Jacqueline was doing in terms of selecting her priorities and focusing on them.  So do you mean that as one goes through their AF list, one is quickly drawn to the things that they at heart know are most important, urgent, due, etc. and focus on those items?  What if these things are not clustered together on the list but may be scattered through a few pages?  Would one still work by the rules because of the feeling that one needs to focus on those particular items?  Is this a common sense thing that you have always said that if it needs to be done, then just focus on it and do it?<br><br>Best wishes to All,<br>-David</div>

I have days where I am just doing what I know needs to be done today, tomorrow, or this week and am just so busy that I seem to ignore my time management system.  Then when things slow a bit....I catch my breath....and then go back to my AF list.  I am not sure this is the way to do things....Mark suggests that one should focus even more on their AF list when things get crazy.

<div class="content">Mark, you state that one should "cut everything out of your list which isn't essential to the goals which you are currently working on" when being extremely pressed on things due in a short period of time.  So when going through your AF list, one becomes very ruthless in terms of dismissing items?

<div class="content">David and Mark: if time presses, presumably other tasks will not stand out.

<div class="content">Hi David,<br><br>I think you and I - probably to a lesser degree, have a somewhat different perspective due to the kind of excessive demands on our time.   I think it can almost change your brain when you've done it long enough - you get into survival mode.  I know that's what's behind my intolerance for any kind of busy work.<br><br>What I would really like to know though David, since you have been in your career for quite some time I think, and are a "work oriented individual" (not that there's anything wrong with that...) :-) like I am - how do you see your time management approach changing when you retire or scale down?  Do you think you'll feel lost without your work?  I need some ideas for the upcoming retirement because the thought of having no external accountability to structure my life is kind of scary.<br><br>Seasons Greetings everyone!</div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline,<br><br>I think that the "next stage" of one's life requires some evolution ... from external to internal accountability.  Some do that better than others.  Some find that they must make artificial external markers ... tell their spouse that they will do X by Y so they will be embarrassed if they don't, kind of thing.<br><br>Identifying early that you might have trouble there is a good first step, I think.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline,<br><br>Mike makes very good points and it is excellent advice.<br><br>As to you and I -- yes, I think we are very much alike and have the same type of jobs.  I have been trying to maintain my normal, 60+ hour a week position as a regular full professor with two NIH grants and thus a large research team -- here and a field team as part of my main study.  Then last April, I was elected as President of the Faculty Senate at my university.  Shared governance is very strong here, so this is a very important position to have.  To say it is a second full-time job is an understatement.  So this is the reason for many of my posts where it seems as if I am still trying things out -- with the different versions of AF, GTD, and other approaches (like Julie Morgenstern's approach of time mapping and scheduling all major tasks).<br><br>My presidency ends on April 28, 2010.  So I will be going through some of the angst of retirement in a sense.  I will have been so harried and on an emergency scanning mode (actually, there was a great article about this on one of the GTD sites that many professionals are on perpetual emergency scanning mode and need a time management approach to deal with this) for so long, that I wlll not know how to act once I become the past-president.  I will still have many responsiblities as past-president, but most of the pressure will be off -- at least with that part of my professional life.<br><br>I am not at all ready to retire -- I am in my mid-fifties and won't retire at the standard 65 anyway as long as my health holds out.  Why?  Well, as a professor, my work is everything to me.  My family always comes first, and I am a very dedicated husband and father....but they know that I am always at my best when very busy.  The thought of how I will handle retirement is indeed a scary one.  I suspect that I will volunteer a lot, and have multiple projects going.   I will be active as a professor emeritus too.  My time management system?  I think AF will be the best then for sure. To be honest though, I am still not convinced entirely that AF is the best for my situation at the moment.  GTD is always there too and I have embraced many of the principles of GTD too over the last year.  I find I have so vey little discretionary time....and so much work comes my way -- not planned work --that would be MORE than enough -- I mean new crises and things that show up in email, phone, etc.  <br><br>At any rate, I think people like us will have some problems initially with retirement.  We must find ways to keep busy.  Here it is on Christmas Day and I am answering your post.  Once done here, I will go back to family and enjoy their company.<br><br>All best wishes,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike,<br>I'm not sure how this will all play out since when I was self-employed and had time management issues years ago, some of that was due to not really enjoying working alone, not so much because of the work in itself.  We'll see.  I'm sure I'll enjoy figuring it out.  :-)<br>Right now, I'm almost giddy with happiness in having so much time available.<br><br>David, thank you for your thoughtful reply.  I hadn't considered before that there was a possible downside to working in a field that you're passionate about.   :-)  I see these profs at my job keep working into their 70's as well and find it inspiring (although I wish they would retire so our budget could balance!)  LOL  <br><br>Trying to keep on top of everything and to give everyone everything that they need from you is almost impossible in those situations.  And if someone is conscientious, they will feel stress and guilt over not keeping up with everything.  I used to be like that, but don't think that way anymore.  I think it came from feeling that my job was SOOOO "important"  (rolling eyes here).  It took my hair falling out in spots and months of illness that I worked and pushed through to make me realize what stress really does to the body and to vow never to go through that again.  I also had to learn how to delegate more, and how to focus on priorities and let the little stuff go and come to the realization that the world wouldn't end if *everything* wasn't done.  If you are your own boss and don't have realistic expectations of yourself, there's certainly nobody else to 'protect' you either.<br><br>I just hope you can get through this busy time without getting burnt out, it sounds like the love of your work will help with that.<br><br>Hope you had a lovely holiday and a wonderful time reconnecting with your family!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline,<br><br>Thanks for your nice comments and advice.  I too hope I can get through this without too much damage due to stress.  Yes, it certainly is hard to do everything, but there is so much that is my responsibilty that it does create some very long days indeed.  But I am getting better now at delegating all that I can.<br><br>I am still using AF4 as my main system although, as I said, I have so much work that just appears at my door, phone, and email that requires me to act NOW that it makes things difficult.  I average at the mimimum four meetings a day, with some days solid from 8:00-6:00.  SO the evenings become time when I catch up on email, my work, etc.<br><br>I was thinking of doing something a little different.  I am thinking of keeping a separate list every day of all of things that come during the day that all of a sudden need my attention today.  It will be interesting then to see how much I get done off of my AF4 list versus the unexpected work that drops in my lap and is very urgent.<br><br>What do you think?  Others?

<div class="content">David<br><br>It sounds a good idea to have a 'current daily list' of the things that crop up that day. If they become less urgent you could perhaps add them to the AF list. Or, perhaps, as others have suggested, is to work the AF list for a certain time period each day. Or focus on the MiT's for the first part of the day, then Urgents, then AF, then urgents, etc?</div>

<div class="content">I don't know David, whenever I've found myself in that kind of situation, I've tried to look more at the source than trying to keep up with the volume, if you know what I mean?  What's the source of all the 'drop everything and do this now?'<br><br>I just have found that any time I have to work in a mode of "this is urgent do it now among all your other things you have to do that will take 14 hours today", I just don't work very effectively.  I need that break to plan things out a bit, skip steps, get someone else to do some or all of it.  If you don't have ADD already, that kind of urgency you're experiencing will lead to it, I'm sure.  It sounds like the kind of work that traders that I've worked with do.  I do like your list idea, if only to capture things things in one place and to analyze what's the common denominator.<br><br>So when you were ill earlier this year, what happened with the work?

<div class="content">When my time stops being "discretionary", I just move into AF2 (where I work repeatedly from the bottom of the list upwards). I've had some urgent situations lately and it just was natural that way. The advantage is that I only need to use one list. Some days, I am basically putting out fires all day.</div>

<div class="content">See the thread about my 2-rule productivity system.  You only need AF4 to direct you if you don't already know what you must work on.  Things that come up during the day which are obviously urgent fall in that category.  There's no need to fret over staying within the system because systems are not needed here.  Return to the system when you have discretionary time.</div>

<div class="content">The problem of running one list which captures both urgent and longer term tasks can largely covered by working the list the AF3 way, I find, and not being too rigid in interpreting the 'rules'. You check from the end frequently for new urgent tasks, but when it feels right, go back to the beginning to tackle the older ones.</div>
