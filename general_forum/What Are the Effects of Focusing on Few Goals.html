<div class="content">Trading coach Van Tharp recommends simplifying one's life and therefore being  more effective by " deciding what you want in life (i.e., your dream life) and then focusing on only one or two simple goals from that dream life"<br><br>I usually have many goals. I am wondering what it would be like to focus on only one goal. Would my life get thrown out of balance? Or would I be much more effective and have more peace of mind? I don't know.<br><br>Has anyone tried focusing on only one or two goals? I would like feed back.</div>

<div class="content">Mark T.<br><br>I have written about focusing on three goals and have personally found it very effective.  Many years ago, I stumbled upon an article about the marine corp rule of three which discusses the idea of three goals or responsibilities being the optimal amount for a soldier to focus on.  When the number increased to four effectiveness fell radically.  This concept along with others I found or developed formed the basis of a goal system I use and now market called Desired Outcomes Implementation Technology.  I found the way to accomplish lots of goals is to keep the list of goals small.  This way you actually get them done and over time get many lists of three completed.  This is more effective than listing say your top ten goals and not making progress on them or having it be very slow due to spreading yourself thin.<br><br>Additionally, I make a distinction between time management and goals.  I have system for time management and then I time block and switch into goals mode.  For instance I work during lunch and evenings on my personal goals using DO IT and during the morning and afternoon I am using time management to try to be an effective employee at the office.   I have some excerpts of the ebook on my blog. Let me know if you have any questions.<br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://www.desiredoutcomes.info" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.desiredoutcomes.info</a></div>

<div class="content">Currently I'm setting up a combination of AF4 and ZTD (Zen To Done), which is very inspiring. Suggest that you have a look at <a href="http://zenhabits.net/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://zenhabits.net/</a> for further ideas goals-wise.<br><br>HTH and lot of success.</div>

<div class="content">I also believe less is best!<br>But for what it's worth, if it where me, I'd go slowly with the decrease.<br>Otherwise, i'd destroy my present points of reference and in my experience, any change in habit rarely stick if it's too sudden.<br><br>@Gerry<br>This study about the Marine Corp is quite interesting!<br>It supports my gut feeling about the subject :)</div>

<div class="content">I think there are certain ongoing life goals; health, family and friends. To pursue other goals exclusively at the expense of these probably is foolish.<br><br>If you want a simple bottom up approach, you could try listing all the things you can do today, but major on the ones that work towards your top 2 or 3 goals.<br><br>cheers,<br>Pete.</div>

<div class="content">I think SmileyPete is right on the spot!<br>The kind of goal that is "Maintenance" on your Areas of Focus should always be addressed.<br><br>As for real big "Projects" as goals (new things in your life),<br>I think that more then a few and they start to be less manageable.</div>
