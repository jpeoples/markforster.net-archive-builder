<div class="content">Here is my simple implementation of AF4 (my "customised" version of it) in OneNote.<br><br>OneNote is very nice software to implement AF because of following features:<br><br>1) It's easy to integrate with Outlook (links, reminders, contacts)<br>2) It's very easy to move tasks from one list to another (e.g. from Open List to Closed List)<br>3) You can tag your notes and then collect (filter) notes by tags. For example - "call" or "shopping"<br>4) You can print page(s) if you decide to go "paper" or like editing notes in paper.<br>5) Very nice feature - OneNote remembers the time of creation/modification of each note, even in one single text block - very useful for DWM users (which I'm not).<br><br>I have created one text block with 4 separators - Current Initative, Urgent (Today) Actions, Closed List, Open List.<br><br>Current Initiative - this is from DIT, that is the single project which you do everyday, first, before any other actions to push this project forward.<br>Urgent Action - what is to be done today (like take someone home from hospital)<br><br>Closed List and Open List are from AF4 - notes can be easily dragged from one to another.</div>

<div class="content">Hi! I've happily done onenote with AF4 for nearly one year now. In my case, the open list and closed list are sections, and tasks are onenote pages, and it works well. I don't use outlook for tasks but it's possible. <br><br>I don't understand your approach. It reads to me like everything is on one page (fine) with just line breaks separating tasks and ------------- separating sections. If so, how does that give you timestamps and dragging and outlook etc. ?  How is this more than you could do with notepad?  I'm sure it is more but I'm not understanding.</div>

<div class="content">Your approach is also interesting, but I can hardly imagine how I can print it if I need to work/do things without PC. Also it Yurihard to create nested blocks of text notes for projects - which I like and do a lot.<br><br>Regarding your question - in my Onenote I can see timestamps (time of last modification - exactly what I need - of each text line in textblock). <br>The same applies to integration with Outlook - I can create linked task from each text line in text block. <br><br>Notepad has no integration with Outlook, no tags, no timestamps. Also Onenote is a very good place for brainstorming and journaling - later items from these sections/pages can be exported to active AF lists.</div>

<div class="content">Printing is slightly awkward for me.  Select all pages - copy as hyperlink - new page - paste - print - delete page, will get me the page titles printed.  Naturally it's quite easy for me to put project notes on any page, though I can see nested text blocks works too.<br><br>I still have no idea how you get those timestamps to appear automatically.  The only times that I ever see is page-creation time.  <br><br>Agree on everything else.  In my case, I use Outlook's Send to OneNote to convert emails into tasks (page = task for me), and don't use Outlook for anything but email.</div>

<div class="content">Alan - Have you tried Mobile Noter for the IPhone?  It syncs your OneNote notebooks nicely.  Handy way to have your AF4 lists with you.  I've structured OneNote as you have with one task per page.<br><a href="http://www.mobilenoter.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.mobilenoter.com/</a></div>

<div class="content">Last I checked MobileNoter didn't allow editing my pages (only its restricted pages), so I found it useless.</div>
