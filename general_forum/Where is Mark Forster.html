<div class="content">He was on vacation in Spain, but is now back. His last Facebook update was 2 hours ago, so he's fine and I guess he'll soon start posting here again. :-)</div>

<div class="content">Even though we might have good reason to suspect it, TK, and even though I know you're being cheeky...I'm not sure about AF5.<br>For me, AF4 has got the balance right.<br><br>Still love it.</div>
