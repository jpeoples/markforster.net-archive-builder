<div class="content">One of the pains of (analog) DWM is the number of bookmarks and jumping around you need to do. But with a Circa system, I remove 1 month from today, 1 week from today, and place them at the beginning of my Circa notebook. The only place holder I need is to remind me where I left off while using DWM (the same way you'd mark a book you were reading). If I have a new idea, project, etc, I simply open my Circa to the first page, and presto, jot it down. Same thing with an unfinished task (though I place this page behind the 1 month from today page). Simple, quick! At the end of the day, I place the pages back where they belong.</div>
