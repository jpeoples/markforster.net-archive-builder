<div class="content">Hey all and hello Mark! I've been reading through all of these systems recently and I really like them. I've read a bunch about Autofocus, Final Version Perfected, Fast Final Version Perfected, etc.<br><br>What I'm wondering is - what is the most recent system that has been created? <br><br>Right now I've just been reading through a bunch to see what stands out to me. I very much like the three I listed above.</div>
