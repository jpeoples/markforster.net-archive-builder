<div class="content">Hello Mark and All,<br><br>One thing I really liked about GTD was the ability to have certain things in contexts that made sense.  For example, the @Agendas context for people you work with.  If I remember things I want to talk to my lab manager about, I would simply add these to her entry in this context.  With AF, I add these to my lists as I remember them or come up with things.  But they are scattered amongst all of the lists.  So when it is time to bring things up in a staff meeting, one has to scan through pages of AF lists to find the topics.  To say the least, this is not very efficient.  I am wondering how to resolve this issue in AF.<br><br>Any thoughts?<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">I use a separate page in the back of my AF notebook for a few things like that -- one for my wife, one for my boss, etc.    I use stickies to make little "tabs" for those pages, so it's easy to turn to them.<br><br>When I have a new task such as "Discuss XXX with boss", I add it to my Boss page, and also add it to my AF list.  Sometimes though, I might just add "Boss" to my AF list -- reminding me to find my boss and discuss the stuff on his list with him.  That reduces the double-entry.  But sometimes having the full entry in the AF list helps to remember that it's particularly important to make sure I grab some of my boss's time.</div>

<div class="content">Hmmm...maybe just keep a separate list of agenda items per person like I just described?<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Hi David<br><br>If I have an item that I feel needs to go on a separate context list such as you describe, I record it in AF as "add x to y list" and then action it by adding it to the context list when I reach the item.  I am normally at my desk when working on my lists and as any supplemental lists are on my PC then those tasks inevitably get actioned on my first pass through the relevant page.  I would then use any necessary reminders (print x list, review x list etc) within AF as appropriate.</div>

<div class="content">Personally for each meeting or conversation, I make out a "Points for X" list. Making that list is of course a task on AF.</div>
