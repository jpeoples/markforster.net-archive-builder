<div class="content">After some weeks of not visiting the forum frequently, I have resumed to see what's new in the way of threads and new responses.  By making a daily visit, I can just focus on postngs wth 'today's' date.<br><br>At least three of the new responses date back to several months ago or even to 200 for the last worthwhile post, eg Christine B's topics, sadly missed now what became of her?<br><br>Also, the latest responses to old topics have spam and/or foreign language entries, notably Russian.<br><br>Maybe the new Mrs Forster finds her new boots Uggly and wants to be Back In The USSR! ;-))))))<br><br>I appreciate newbies can find value n older postings, but  there s a case for corralling all topics without any previous posting for the last three or six months into a separate holding area.  Any updates to these can be notified as a one message on the live, current forum.</div>

<div class="content">On the other hand, if newbies weren't resurrecting old threads, how much  activity would there be?  I think the ones they're finding are worth a second look.</div>

<div class="content">I just counted now.  So far today, 5 spammed threads, 3 useful content threads, and this one.  Which unfortunately means useful new content is hard to find.  I wish every post was controlled by a captcha system so bots couldn't get in.</div>
