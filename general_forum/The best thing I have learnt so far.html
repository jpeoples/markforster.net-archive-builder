<div class="content">The best thing I have learnt so far on this site (and I haven't finished reading yet!) is to ring fence the backlog.  I can't tell you have many areas of my life feel out of control, and I've read so many organisation books that my head spins.  It all seemed so complicated to set up these systems - especially in view of all the things I had piled up that I needed to see to.<br><br>What I love about this one piece of advice is that it takes away all my most pressing concerns - I can set up a sensible system (I'm working on AF) and the backlog is now just a project that I spend time on and which I know will eventually clear instead of just getting bigger.<br><br>This has been so stressful for me, that I now feel a great weight has been lifted and I can now move forward with some energy.  The only thing that annoys me is that I am a fairly intelligent person and this just never occured to me!  Talk about not seeing the wood for the trees!  They really should teach these life skils in school.</div>

<div class="content">Alison, that's one great thing I've learned from Mark, too! And another has been the "little and often" technique. Actually, there's been SO many helpful things, but that one is top of mind this morning!</div>

<div class="content">If you have a large backlog, I will be curious to see if this aha lasts very long. This is why so many people continually tweak and twist rules and spend time prognosticating on what Mark might be doing next. Getting honest on what you can do and what you *want* to do is IMHO the bedrock of AF.<br><br>Mark's AFs in all their flavors have been helpful for me. The most important thing I have learned is to relentlessly dismiss, dismiss, dismiss.<br><br>I don't look at the techniques as much as time management, but rather energy management. How many things do I put down to do have more to do with my naive fantasies about life and my fantasies about the expectations of others'?<br><br>I typically do not wax as nearly newagey as others here, but rather than asking what I need to get done, the better question for me is what needs my help in getting done.<br><br>The humbling answer is not much of anything. For me and for others this undramatic answer is the outgrowth of discernment through meditation, prayer, and in my case AF as well.<br><br>Good luck!</div>
