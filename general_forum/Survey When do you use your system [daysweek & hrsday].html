<div class="content">All day, all week, but I deliberately make some "time off" to break from using it and to enjoy more freely what comes to my mind: usually evenings and Sundays. I work/live more intuitively/without tight structure during these times. It is both refreshing and important for me.</div>

<div class="content">Pretty much all the time.<br><br>I have some routine activities, basic one like bathroom usage and others like some type of readings, that I don't manage with the system but just do. More or less strictly.<br><br>Everything else is in the system.</div>

<div class="content">Previously only in spurts. Latley I have been using it all the time but with my "unit" being a week instead of a day. Been helpful.</div>
