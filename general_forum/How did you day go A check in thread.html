<div class="meta">2014-02-14 1:17</div>
<div class="content">Hi,<br><br>Anyone else think it might be instructive to report on our productivity for the day, along with accomplishments, system used, mitigating factors and lessons learned?  I'll start:<br><br>Today: Productive day, not highly productive, but productive<br>Accomplishments: Much if not most of one large difficult prpject done. Lots of small tasks that contribute towards larger projects done.<br>System Used: Modified DIT with Randomizer. Modifed in that I randomized my hotlist of about 10 items with yesterdays tasks. If I stop work on a hotlist item but do not complete it (my large difficult project) I add it back on the hotlist. I got through the hotlist (but not the difficult project) and yesterdays tasks. I did not formally get to anything else.<br>Mitigating factors: Snow day, office closed. Three work phone calls but no other meetings (Bliss!) Family matters though, but was able to work most of the day (Thanks spouse!)<br>Lessons LEarned: This was a productive set up. I got most of the important things done via the hotlist and randomizing made it go quickly. I got a few less urgent tasks that were created yesterday done, it was nice to have them addressed so quickly. But I did not get to the rest of my list, and I did not complete my major project (though I am close). <br><br>Looking forward to trying this again tomorrow and hearing from others on what worked for them today.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Veghead Jones<br>I had clear snow of car on list, but then it rained afterward. Yay!<br><br>I worked about 75% the standard way - do the list. <br>I'm about 30" away from closing out a project because I lucked out by getting the groove of what I usually hate.  Don't ask me how it happened. It just did. <br><br>Then I spent about an hour playing the randomizer game on the list like you do.<br>Then I spent about 30 " clearing up the day. Rounding up 3 projects I started, filing.<br><br>Then after dinner I decided to play the randomizer for house work like your list just for the hell of it..  Laundry done and house is sparkling (detailed work).  I can't say how it happened. Most likely, it was the novelty of the game and my pain wasn't so bad. Or....it could be that I want to go out tomorrow.  I only have about 3hours of MITs tomorrow.  Fingers crossed that nothing same day urgent arrives to mess up my little plan.<br><br>Thanks for telling us about your system.  I can't take credit for doing so well with the dreaded project. I don't know why it happened.  It felt like running the table after the break and doing 2 more times.  Being "on" is purely a gift.  It doesn't happen very often to me. I'll take it when it comes.<br><br>I had a better day today than yesterday for sure! I actually feel a little bit proud...<br><br>I'm actually looking forward to tomorrow.  I'm waiting to see my resistance to really stalemate me so that I can really test your method.  I will happen. I can count on it.</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>I don't rewrite. It stays there until it's done for today.  I had 2 little things from yesterday that I forgot. That took 3-4 minutes.  I'm pretty good at clearing the MITs.<br>To be frank, I usually don't blitz my house like I did tonight after my work.  I hope it was because of your system and not just a fluke. Usually I spread the detail dirty out a bit.  I'm glad it's gone for awhile! Thanks!  LOL!</div>

<div class="content">Systems Used: <br><br>- Day list. About 10 LAOs, then about 15 tasks or projects are urgent or are bothering me. Do not erase from other lists; worrisome projects have several entries.<br><br>- Morning LAO block. Doing several LAOs in the morning works well, but not so many that I neglect the other projects. Do in order that makes sense or feels right at the moment. <br><br>- Randomizer. Use a large enough die to get me off the day list 1/4 of the time. Very rough count, and continue using same die as day list shrinks). Start on day list, then day lists for last week (keeps projects moving, often has tasks with "next week" deadlines), then to the bookmark in main list. Count "done" lines and slide as per Mark's system. Tweak: Near end of day, slid to task needed for meeting.<br><br>- Common Sense. Had to review the outstanding accounts to make report for meeting, and randomizer refused to choose it.<br><br>Results: Happy<br><br>Success on most of my LAOs. Meditating mid-day as mental reset wasn't working. Kept delaying it and other things. Today put it back in the morning LAO group and had a good day. Singing after daughter came home worked.<br><br>Happy with number of mosquito tasks done. Landed on several tasks to prepare for the evening's meeting before I activated the "slide until you reach one" tweak. Finally had to do the "remember 7 things at once" task, which the randomizer hadn't chosen in 3 days, and discovered (no surprise) that it was easier than I expected.<br><br>Plan: Same thing today, but start with quick pass for things due before Monday.<br><br>Learning,<br><br>Sometimes I blitz the house and am so happy with the results that I wonder why I try to spread things out. It lasts two blitzes if I'm lucky. The important parts are on my list (and tickler for longer cycles). The detail cleaning I do as I feel like it, but I'm thinking of adding "detail room X" to my big list, and letting randomizer deal with it.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Veghead Jones<br>I was so worried about MITs interfering with plans that I woke up at 4am ish and knocked them out using the standard method.  My estimated 3' total time was sliced down to about 2 1/4. Yay!<br><br>This is where I sometimes get stuck. My MITs are completed and I have the day in front of me yet I'm reluctant to do the lesser work.  It's 1pm and I haven't touched ANYTHING beyond the MITs which is usually OK.  Hmmmm.  Aha!  This is the perfect opportunity to make another fake MIT list and try out your system!<br><br>Hi Cricket<br>I keep the house clean every day from habits. It's the detail work that I spread out. <br><br>For some unknown reason when I did it last night (I rarely clean at night), it was almost enjoyable. I do not enjoy doing this kind of work at all!  Maybe that was the randomizer effect. Nobody else notices such things as the calk is scrubbed or the oven is gleaming but I notice. I suppose that's all that really matters, yeah?<br><br>Hi Avrum<br>Ignore my posts. I usually come here when I'm too drugged to do much else. Because I sometimes go over a month with no interaction with anybody, this is my only communication. Sucks, right?  LOL!</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>Now that I'm between German Shepherds, my house work and dog maintenance is reduced by over 50%. My previous GSD allowed me to vacuum her daily with the Dyson hose and use the Dremel sander to keep her claws short and tight to keep that beautiful ball formation of the paws.  My last GSD was a real weeny.  I had to hand comb and rake her 2 coats and I had to use a human toe clipper and nail file for her claws.  She was worth it though.  I love having so much less work yet I'm starting to jones for another GSD.  I've had them since 1976. They are so easy to train and so interactive.  You have to stay of top because they can get an attitude.  LOL!</div>

<div class="content">I agree with avrum - shorter is better when you're tracking progress daily.<br><br>I do try to keep track of my progress at work (weekdays) through a text file that I call my LCS Diary.  I draft an entry at midday and finalize it at the end of the day or the next morning.  Each entry consists of something I Learned, something I Created, and something I Shared.  A bad or unproductive day is one for which there is a blank after the L:, C:, or S:.  A good day is when all three are related and/or some have multiple parts.<br><br>Usually there are just three short lines of text for each day.   Here's a recent example:<br><br>========<br>Wed 12 Feb<br>L: PolCov is amp-scale-sensitive, but maybe try PolCor?<br>C: polcovim-5sc.png<br>S: polcovim-5sc.png (to Stevens).<br>========<br><br>This obviously won't make sense to anyone but me, and it's not focused on what productivity system I'm using.  But it is short!</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Learning! I am not so sure that it is really my system, but I am glad it worked fo you!<br><br>I had a very productive day. The office was empty so fewer interruptions, which helped a lot. I finished my really big project, got one near completion and started a dreaded one. <br><br>Same methodology of creating a hotlist, randomizing that with yesterday's tasks. My hotlist had 15 items with 11 items completed. Yesterdays list was 14 items, 11 completed.<br><br>Lessons learned: The system worked again. ooking forward to seeing how it does next week. WIth that one big project done I hope to have at least one day of working the whole list. We'll see how it goes</div>

<div class="content">Good tool for this kind of thing:<br><a href="http://idonethis.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://idonethis.com/</a><br><br>I spent almost all day in meetings (thankfully, good productive meetings).  <br><br>In between meetings I researched product information management tools.<br><br>At lunch and a bit in evening, I researched some project mgmt tools, and was happy with the progress.  I'll post separately on that.  <br><br>Happy with the day - meetings were very productive, research on PIMs was very interesting and will be useful, research on TM+PM tools made good progress (since I finally figured out what I really wanted).  Plus, car got fixed at mechanic, got some errands done after work.  Had a borderline migraine in later afternoon but managed to knock it out with some strong coffee.   Still have a bunch to do but will probably save it for early morning.<br><br>Lessons:  helpful to clarify objectives before going on an internet research binge. :-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Veghead Jones<br>Congrats!  A few questions because I'm probably going to do some work tomorrow. <br><br>When you said that if you don't complete a task on the MIT list, you rewrite it like Mark does. Does that mean that you keep it on that day's list or put it on tomorrow's MIT list?  <br><br>For me, if I get swamped with same day surprise stuff and THAT turns into a project, if I'm forced to react same day, I'll do that but put the rest to either tomorrow's list of what I can do or put a notation on the calendar if I'm forced to wait on somebody else.<br><br>Sometimes if I get really swamped by surprise important crappola and it kills my other work plans, I'll use an entire day to furiously work to get things back to as close to normal as possible.  Also, sometimes other things happen where my week's plans get screwed like medical procedures that put me down for the count for awhile.  <br><br>It's nice to have a day once in awhile where I don't make any progress plans for current work.  I just devote the day putting things back to normal as much as possible.  Sometimes it even goes into the weekend. *blush*  <br><br>I call the weekends "catch up or celebrate". Monday is "golden Monday" - a brand new week!  Yay!  That helps to keep me going during the week.  That's why I sometimes like to give an entire Friday to get things back to sort of normal when I can.  If others have me by the short hairs, it's impossible but I do what I can.  Sometimes I get lazy in the week so I have to crunch out the work that suffered. LOL!<br><br>Do you ever have MITs that go back further than yesterday's MITs?  I just got over a patch where bombs were exploding like crazy.  I had to just pump out work just to prevent from getting even further behind.  I was writing MITs and then the day's demands would laugh in my face.  LOL!  Sometimes I had to create another Midday, Evening and Night MIT to keep the changing stuff in some sort of order.  What do you do when things blow up like that?  Has it happened yet since your MIT + regular list modification?<br><br>Thanks for starting this great thread.  I hope you have a great weekend and a great Monday.<br><br>Seraphim<br>LOL!  Are you having fun?  LOL!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Seraphim<br>p.s.<br>Your other post didn't mention your migraine. I definitely feel for you. It's a sensation that's tough to ignore.  <br><br>I thought that I was the only one who used a coffee and aspirin cocktail for migraines. LOL!  I also have a deviated septum that somehow causes some real whoppers!  If that's what I suspect, I'll use a sinus relief med first. Alas, sometimes nothing helps so I just try to rest but I'm kind of restless.  There's always some donkey work that I can do in the meanwhile. LOL!</div>

<div class="content">Learning - Yes, I did a bunch of edits on that post - you are not hallucinating!   LOL<br><br>And yes, coffee + aspirin are my two main migraine medicines, especially taken with food.   About 15 years ago I used Excedrin, but it includes Tylenol which made me nauseated.  The only other ingredients are caffeine and aspirin.   So I just started using those two separately, and get the relief without the nausea.<br><br>I'm not surprised about a deviated septum causing migraines.   I found that after getting treated for sleep apnea, the migraines got a lot better.   (though not eliminated)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Seraphim<br>How did you edit your post after it posted?  God knows that it would help me and spare the readers if I knew how to do that. After the drugs wear off I could do a massive purge.  LOL!  <br><br>I'm sorry about your migraines.  I know that mine are probably wimpy compared to yours.  Before the accident I rarely got headaches. I'd go years without getting them.  My mom and sis used to get them.  I felt so bad for them.  My stress showed mostly in bruxism since I was a kid.  My grandma swore by Excedrin.  She refused anything else!  <br><br>My sis and dad had sleep apnea. In the last years he used to sleep sitting up. My sis puts on a mask whenever she sleeps even for naps.  She said it really helps her.  I'm glad that the sleep apnea therapy is helping your migraines.  When my head is exploding I can't do much because I can't sharpen any thoughts.  At best, I can manage grunt work if I don't move my head too much.  Sometimes it gives me debilitating vertigo.  Then I'm stuck in zombie mode. I hate that.  Does that happen to you also?  Sounds are excruciating.<br><br>I sincerely hope that you find more ways to help yourself.  I'm kind of stuck. I refuse to get my deviated septum done.  I'm so tired of medical procedures but they keep on coming. bleh!</div>

LEt me know if you have questions though and I'll provide more detail.<br><br>If I stop doing a task on the hotlist I add it to the end of the hotlist. If at the end of the day it is not completed it goes on my regular action list to possibly get hit tomorrow.<br><br>There are MITS scattered throughout my book but I don't worry about them. If it si truly an MIT it will make it to the hotlist. My hotlist is comprised of actions tied to today's appointments (ased on my calendar, actions tied to deadlines (I keep a deadline list) actions tied to important projects (I keep a project list) and things that are on the top of my head (I try to do a braindump every morning). If something urgent or important comes up in the day, it goes on the hotlist as well, otherwise my action book to randomize tomorrow.<br><br>Hope this helps, Please ask if you have any questions</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark<br>Thanks for the kind offer. I read far slower than I type. 14" wouldn't allow me to even read 1/2 of it.  That hurts me badly because I used to read a lot.  The drugs take about 4-5 hours.  Hoo boy. <br><br>Hi Veghead Jones<br><br>Thanks for the explanation.  Just to make sure that I comprehended your teachings…<br>1. You rewrite if you haven't finished an MIT right on the list but if you haven't finished it, you put it on your main list and hope to see it soon enough when you do the main list rotations, yeah?<br><br>2.  Like you, I rely heavily on my calendar yet keep a separate deadline and pending/follow up list.  It comes in handy when I have to chase down slackers.  LOL!<br><br>3.  I love having a projects queue because it helps me to have an overview of what I need to do and want to do.  I don't look at this every day because I also make a weekly list of what I want to do and then from that and other references, I build the daily MIT list.  <br><br>4. My mind is too squirrelly to do a brain dump.  I could think of way too many things.  If a list is too long it doesn't register in my head.  I keep lists in categories or projects.  I have my rolling list of one offs and recurring stuff.  I simply review the calendar, deadlines and my weekly map.  If I feel game, I'll look at other lists.  I have  fake deadlines for the bundling stuff but I like to use little and often to make sure that I meet the deadlines.  It helps me to keep things current or a bit ahead.  I wish I had your normal brain.  LOL!<br><br>Do you use randomization for the entire day?  I try to knock out the MITs first out of habit but when resistance is heavy, it's quite difficult to do.  I love your system but already I've cheated.  Today, I felt some serious resistance so I just kept playing the randomization on the mit list until I almost safely done.  THEN I did the rotating to the general list.  It really helped me.  I think you nailed it.  This is great for people who like to work with a daily MIT list.  Also, your system helps me to do more with the recurring and one offs.  Lots of times I just bail once the MITs are done.  LOL!<br><br>Today was optional but I'm set on testing your system.  It really went better than I thought.  I started a nasty yearly project that proved to be much less horrible than I feared.  I crunched out 1'36" on it.  Tomorrow I'll finish it.  I felt like a valiant knight seriously wounding the dragon.  Tomorrow that bad boy is toast!  LOL!<br><br>Win-win. I only have the snow to thank for making me be stuck in the house.  Otherwise I wouldn't have done 4 hours of boring work.  LOL!  That helps to shorten next week's obligations.  I'm actually shocked that this almost feels *fun* to do yet my MITs get done!  Cool!<br><br>Thanks again for explaining the details.  Overall, I think our systems are quite similar.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Learning,<br><br>IF I work on something on my hotlist and I don't complete it, I have the choice of reentering on my hotlist (and including it in the randomizer) or put it on tomorrow's list. 99.99% of the time I put it back on the hotlist until it is done or until I leave for the day, then on the list to work tomorrow. <br><br>I definitely randomize the hotlist (MITS). Depending on what is on the hotlist (how hot it actually is) I randomize that list first, then yesterday's list second, then the whole book from the beginning. But I have started to randomize the hotlist in with yesterday's tasks and that has been working. It means that I get some less important (right now)  tasks mixed in, which tends the make the whole routine less stressful, unless of course I spend to much time on those things, in which case I focus on the randomized hotlist. <br><br>Let me know what you think and how it works for you.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Veghead Jones<br>Wow! Thanks for the details about varying things when needed.  I got to a late start today because I normally don't work on Sundays but I really feel compelled to keep testing this.  It seems almost too good to be true.  Luckily the idea of working on Sunday cranked up the overall resistance factor.  I decided to do a few separate mini MIT lists of 4 mini sections of MIT tasks and one black space.  After each timed set if I hadn't completed all of the tasks, I'd do the SMEMA thing at add X more to equal 4 plus another blank one.  After 2 of them, I started getting antsy so I just clobbered the MIT list.  hmmmm.  Maybe I can use that trick again so see if my impatience of the mini sets gives me the impetus to finish it.  I hope it's not a fluke.<br><br>I took a HUGE break to watch the Olympics. There's nothing like watching champions to stir the passions.  I caught myself humming the theme song while I finally killed yesterday's dragon.  I stumbled and didn't complete tying up the loose ends.  I'll do that tonight. <br><br>Thanks so much.  Fingers crossed that we're really on to something, yeah?  I'm especially excited that your system is teaching me to respect the other list more.  LOL!  I couldn't help but think while I was sweeping the snow off of my car, breaking the 6-8 inch icicle formations along the sides and scraping the windshield how inglorious that was compared to what those champions are doing with the snow and ice. Those snowboarders are incredible, yeah?<br><br>Golden Monday is near and I'm actually a bit excited to keep testing your great system.  I think it's more than just novelty. It's a Godsend if I can keep it up overall.  <br><br>Good luck for tomorrow, Veghead.</div>

<div class="content">Hi all<br>today I did the MITs fairly quickly by doing it straight and then randomizing it when I felt resistance. It went really well.  Also I was feeling high resistance to a project because my mind wasn't being creative. I mixed it with the main list and just worked on it without knowing what would happen.  Nothing creative emerged yet I felt great that the randomizer had me approach it.  Sometimes when I don't seem to progress, the process of trying sometimes inspires me.  It didn't happen today but I'm really impressed that the randomizer had me trying even though I had no idea what to do!  Really good day again.  I'm really starting to believe in using the randomizer a bit more often to keep me going even if I've got nothing in my head.  Avoiding it would have been worse at least psychologically.  <br><br>I hope tomorrow works out alright for everybody. I really like mixing standard doing the list with randomizing it when it helps.  It's definitely more effective since Veghead Jones gave me the idea of using the general list also.  I can't put my finger on it but doing both seems to feel better.</div>

<div class="content">Hi all<br>I've enjoyed experimenting with the randomizer method and will do so for awhile longer until I feel that I've got it down better.  One thing that I've discovered is that I don't like using the randomizer as a hard rule set.  Overall, I prefer to get the MITs done the regular way.  It helps to keep my brain in focus toward my day's goals.  The only time I use the randomizer is if I'm intentionally creating some distraction to relax my brain a bit after concentrated work.<br><br>Veghead Jones<br>I do LOVE your idea of periodically using the randomizer on the general list to help remind me of the other stuff waiting in the wings.  Your way helps me to remember and get current on the background stuff before if becomes an actual concern.  Thanks!</div>

Checked with neurologist who said, "Yes, do it, but very few of my patients are comfortable running even without a migraine." He had cluster migraines so bad that he'd run outside in the middle of an Ottawa snowstorm (till Mom insisted he get a home gym).<br><br>Seraphim: Idonethis.com looks good, but $60/year is pricy if we can find another way. Maybe a bulletin board. Each person gets a board, each day a thread? Or each person a thread, new thread each month?</div>

<div class="content">Hi<br>I did well despite medical crap eating up energy and time but I left FOUR incomplete yesterday pages.  I "touched" them but left the loose ends for completed work so that I could stay current on everything.  I'm thinking of adding a time block midweek just to make sure that the yesterday pages aren't neglected. Then on Friday, I won't have too many of those loose ends haunting me.  I need to get better at giving this more priority.  Maybe the sacrifice will be being a bit slower knocking out new work so that everything is properly tied up vs doing more actual work.  How do you handle this?</div>

<div class="content">Weekend:<br><br>Borderline.<br><br>Didn't sleep well, even when I went to bed on time. Daughter's brand new hamster is sick. Spent 2 hours at vet.<br><br>Was also fired up about trying One Minute To Do List on ToodleDo. Always happens. I get excited about making progress, and can't sleep.<br><br>Q1: 0/0. (Fed the family well-enough.)<br>LAOs: Don't do on weekends.<br>Q2: Lots of roadblocks. Needed husband's password for one task while he was at work. Wanted to make ToodleDo account, and learned my password program isn't synching properly between devices. Data is still there, and I now have a paper backup just in case, but I want the support ticket answered before I try to recover it.<br><br>++++<br><br>SOCIAL<br><br>Learning, It depends on the type of loose end. If others will need to use it, I at least get it all in one file. If others won't need to use it, often the pile reaches critical size before I tackle it. My to be filed pile is terrible. My craft corner is awkward, since the relative amount of each supply varies, and I have several active projects. Every time I clean it out and resort it, it lasts two months before I need something from the bottom, no matter how well I try to put active things on top.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Cricket<br>You stated:<br>"Q1: 0/0. (Fed the family well-enough.)" "Daughter's brand new hamster is sick. Spent 2 hours at vet."<br><br>That's so sweet.  <br><br>If somebody else is involved somehow, that's enough impetus to keep things ordered and timely.<br><br>I have trouble when I'm jamming out lots of work.  I keep projects in separate folders but if I don't transcribe my illegible notes soon enough, I won't know what they said.  I usually have the year closed out by January 31 each year but this year I'm not done a month later.  That's infuriating.  If I go more than a couple of weeks, then I forget things.  It's a hard call whether to knock out the work early at the expense of keeping the project folders ordered immediately, or to slow down my work output enough to continually order the files.  Many files I'll never see again unless I'm challenged to prove or explain something.  I keep it all for seven years.  It's also tying up loose ends for things smaller than project status.  Veghead Jones MIT rotated with yesterday page has helped me but I need to do more than "touch" yesterday.  Of course, there's always too much to do.  It's all a judgement call.</div>

<div class="content">REPORT:<br><br>Wasted morning.<br><br>1-Day including LAOs (Critical Now): Even though wasted the morning, got a lot done.<br>3-Day (Opportunity Now, subset Target Now): Nothing done. <br>10-Day (Opportunity Now): None.<br>Over-the-Horizon: None.<br><br>++++<br><br>System Changes<br><br>Moved urgent tasks to Toodledo, sorted by urgency using Linenberger's categories.

Something is due today whether I'm optimistic or not. It's an old bad habit. If I'm optimistic, more things feel like they should be done today. Would I stay late to do them?

I dabble in shorthand, but not enough to be confident reading it. (The forums all say to read lots of shorthand, both your own and others'. It's easy to read notes I took only a few days ago, especially if I took the same passage multiple times.)<br><br>I try to err on the side of slowing down when taking notes, since I know I won't stop early to fix them, or take the time on another day. Usually there are slow spots in meetings when I can fix messy bits. (I'm learning I don't even need to take half the notes I used to.) If it's notes I make to help me think (math, planning), I only tidy the action items and summary.</div>
