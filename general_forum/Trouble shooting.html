<div class="content">I have a theory that when something goes wrong, in fact at least two things are wrong: <br>1) The source of the problem.  <br>2) The thing that failed to avert the problem.<br><br>Last Saturday I was on course for a productive day at home.  I was going through my list, getting many things done, until I got to one task:   Do some office work.  Now this task I was avoiding, but I picked it because I felt there were some important things I ought to tackle.  So I turned on my computer to check my work list.<br><br>I never made it.  Instead I mentally checked out.  I checked email, surfed the web, and watched DVDs. Out of nowhere, my productive day was zapped.  <br><br>1) Why did this happen? The immediate trigger here was the perceived difficulty of the task.  I picked up my computer with the notion that I intended to tackle some troubling bit of office work, only I didn't know what work that would be, how long it might take, or whether I could make useful progress at this time.  That is a tall order for one task.  <br><br>Instead I should have made it a smaller task: Just *study* my office list.  Don't *do* anything.  In the process of studying the list, I could select something to do, or not.  And if I select one, I only write that on my AF list.<br><br>2) Now why didn't I cope well with this trigger?  I *should* have been able to recognize this giant task and either put it off, or rise up to the challenge.  That didn't happen, and I think Erik's video blog  explained why, very elegantly.  I needed balance, and a variety of tasks to keep various kinds of energy high.  I had lots of energy, but in one respect it was lacking.  <br><br>I needed to take a break to recharge.  And I needed perspective, to realize that I could freely take that break.  This week I'm working on improving my perspective, to cope better in the future.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Alan,<br><br>You're not alone, describes what happens to me as well.<br><br>One technique for me, IF I can stop myself wandering off at a tangent to pleasurable things in time, is to use the Salami Technique which has already had several mentions on this forum in the past.<br><br>My version is to start off with a very small slice - 10 mins - and increase subsequent slices by 5 minutes each phases.  Six phases results in 10 + 15 + 20 + 25 + 30 +35 = 135 minutes of work and usually ending with a good feeling, and a reward like spending time on this forum.<br><br>Another reason for things going wrong: sh*t happens and it usually rolls downhill.<br><br>A luta continua.<br><br>Roger J</div>

<div class="content">@Alan<br><br>Wow,... thanks!<br>I know I say it often but it's that kind of feedback that makes me do other videos :)<br>I'm really happy that you think that balance is of worth to you in your life and that you are willing to accept the inherent changes it will make on your stance about a lot of things.</div>

<div class="content">@Erik, c'est ma plaisir!<br><br>@Roger.  I figured I wasn't alone.  That salami method would not have worked for me last Saturday.  As written it sounds like a commitment to do 135 minutes of work over a short period of time, work I wasn't actually prepared to do.  Even just 10 minutes wouldn't happen because I wasn't prepared to do that.  I actually needed the two steps of (2) Relax and (1) Study the task without doing (which sounds much like Erik's structured procrastination).</div>

<div class="content">@Alan: the Salami Technique for moi is not a commitment, it's a way to get going to see how much I can get done.  I usually use it for 'big' tasks I have to do , but just cannot get going for long enough to make progress, eg a difficult report<br>I guess my conscience/rational part (if I have one) is locking horns with my will/'I'd rather do anything other than what I have to do'.<br>So I start with the 10 minutes and just keep going until I'm either REALLY beginning to tire, finished it, or taken such a big bite that the sense of achievement is REAL.<br>In practice, I have to say that sometimes it fails at eg the 15 minute mark = 25 minutes total, but more often i find myself getting into the groove, even if I am muttering 'Why the hell did I not get on to this earlier?', cue for some mental self-flagellation etc.</div>
