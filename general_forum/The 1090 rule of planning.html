The video expands on the whole seems pretty good.<br><br>The title rule says "The first 10% of time you spend planning and organizing your work before you begin will save you as much as 90% of the time in getting the job once you get started."  This itself not well formulated.  <br><br>But the thought behind it is taking extra time to plan can save a lot of time in execution.  It does so by clarifying exactly what you will do and how, so that you don't spend a lot of time doing the wrong things, the wrong way, or simply ineffectively.  Also by simply knowing the game plan can be motivating to work better.</div>

<div class="content">I have to admit that I've mostly had bad experiences with planning. Except in very well trodden paths, I've just never found planning to be particularly effective. It's been mostly a waste of time. However, preparation has been highly valuable. Setting myself up with a clear vision and then preparing a set of processes, behaviors, and structures to enable me to continuously and rapidly adjust my heading to continue effectively towards that vision with minimal planning has been the most effective in the widest range of contexts for me. Most of the domains I work in don't have sufficient clarity to enable me to make any sort of useful plan.</div>

<div class="content">I never go for a comprehensive detailed plan. Those never work out.  What I'm interested in are: the goal (which as 'plan-backwards' suggests, can be adjusted), a rough idea of how I will get there, and what I should do next.  Regarding what to do next, I learn from the Lean Startup field that it's often best to focus on clarifying uncertainties first.  Which effectively means always improving the pixel-resolution of the target.  If focus is clear, then just whatever moves me towards the next junction quickest is the plan.<br><br>Target, Direction, Next Step.</div>
