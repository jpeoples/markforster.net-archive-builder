<div class="content">What are some of the heuristics you use for multi-month or otherwise "endless" projects?<br><br>Do you tend to break it down into smaller chunks to put in your SuperFocus planner, or just have "Project X" listed?<br><br>Maybe you keep it as your constant companion in Column 2, or do you treat it as a "just a little bit" at a time project?<br><br>I'm exploring this aspect in my own use of SuperFocus. I generally start by adding an abstract name, then if I get stuck on it, try to break it down into actions that I add to the end of the list.</div>

<div class="content">Ryan, you have hit *quite* the topic, which has generated many threads on this forum.<br><br>The short answer is: use whatever works best for the particular project, for your style and comfort level. You touched on several strategies above, and all of them can work.<br><br>For more detail, explore this forum. Project management was a hotter topic a few weeks ago, so page back a bit.<br><br>Here is one thread I found to get you started:<br>"Varying complexity of work"<br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1434887" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1434887</a><br><br>Some general advice: most of us don't need as much project management as we think. Experiment on a project that isn't too critical but is somewhat complex. See how little overhead you can get away with. Can you just jot various details, ideas, subtasks, and options into C1 and let it churn? See how much you can trust SF. See whether SF tempts you to "get around to it" more than you otherwise would. (It probably will!)<br><br>Enjoy the process.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Bernie! I'll go through the archives and try to summarize some heuristics.</div>
