<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2012-10-18 22:51</div>
<div class="content">I recently made a deliberate choice to focus exclusively on one major project until it was accomplished.  I did other stuff only if they became urgent.  It was worth it.  I made tremendous progress on the project, and I expect to be able to channel that into valuable stuff.  At the same time, everything else fell to the side, and it's not a healthy long-term strategy to be so narrowly focused.  <br><br>So I'm today returning to FV and a balanced work style.  <br><br>I think I'm going to approach it from a "zero-based budgeting" philosophy.  Starting with the one thing I'm doing, I'm going to only do things I'm committed to doing, and add commitments as they are justified, and manage those commitments with FV.</div>
