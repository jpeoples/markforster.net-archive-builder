<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>Just got done with reading GED and I'm 20% through DIT; but I have read some summaries of DIT.  My worry is that I have created backlogs before and quite often have had to rummage through it because I 'NEED' something.  <br><br>Is there any suggestions when creating a backlog may improve that scenario?  I don't want to make it unnecessarily hard to create a backlog, but if the effort is worth it.<br><br>P.S. I currently already have a fairly large backlog.<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Bryant</div>

<div class="content">Hi, Brian<br><br>I'm not quite clear why searching for something in a backlog is any more difficult than searching for it before it's made into a backlog. Remember the idea is not to sit on the backlog for ever, but to work on clearing it through the Current Initiative.<br><br>If you have to find something because you need it, then it no longer remains part of the backlog but is re-entered into new work.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">I agree with Mark.<br><br>I created a backlog in January that I am still working through when I have the time.  However, if I think of a task it is added it to my list of things to do tomorrow, even if it is already on the backlog.  I don't look back through the backlog to cross it off, instead when I am next reviewing the backlog I cross any that have either been completed or have migrated on to my current list.  <br><br>I find it is a good method of prioritising the tasks on the backlog, because the ones that you still think about are the ones you really need to get done so they are added on to the current list ensuring they get completed.</div>

<div class="content">Dear Kate<br><br>Thanks for your post. It did raise a couple of questions in my mind though.<br><br>1) It seems a long time still to have a backlog that was created in January. Have you made it your Current Initiative (backlogs should have priority for that slot) and are you working on it first thing every day? (I always distrust the phrase "when I have the time"!!)<br><br>2) If the backlog is so non-urgent that you can afford to have it hanging it around for months, then do you really need to action it at all? Why not just dump it?  You can give yourself a week to remove essential items before doing so.</div>

<div class="content">Hello Mark,<br><br>Yes it is a long time to have a backlog, I definitely fall into the category of too many tasks at work.<br><br>I work on the backlog as my current initiative first thing in the morning when there is nothing else of higher priority (January to March is the last quarter of our financial year, so there have been several times when end of year activities have needed to be worked on as my current initiative).<br><br>Each time I complete something from the list I also aim to cross at least one other item off as no longer required.  Many of the items currently listed do not need to be completed now, but would be helpful if I completed them.  I guess they fit in to the Someday/maybe category from Getting things done. <br><br>I am starting some analysis of my workload to understand where the problem lies with the generation of so many tasks, but I fear it is part of working for a consultancy.</div>

<div class="content"><<but I fear it is part of working for a consultancy>><br><br>As I've said to other people who've made similar remarks, if you are not able to get everything done then how are you deciding what gets done well, what gets done less than well and what doesn't get done at all?<br><br>You are making these decisions somehow. Isn't it better to make them rationally and in line with your overall goals, rather than randomly as you go along?<br></div>

<div class="content">I agree Mark.  I used to select items from my list that I wanted to do, but this meant that I often had to work really hard to meet deadlines.  Now,I select tasks from my list that have deadlines or have top priority (they work towards my goals) and when they are completed I work on tasks with a lower priority.<br><br>Of course depending on how I feel I use some of your other techniques such as rotations, greatest resistance and little and often to help me get through the tasks and reduce procrastination.</div>
