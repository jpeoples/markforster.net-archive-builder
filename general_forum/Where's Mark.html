<div class="content">Anyone know what happened to Mark?  I saw him post briefly on the Yahoo Group on August 6th but besides that he's been awfully quiet.  I miss his incisive and succinct wisdom.</div>

<div class="content">His twitter is quite, too. Well, there have been extended periods when Mark didn't go online in the past. I wish him the best, whatever he's doing right now.</div>

<div class="content">Hopefully he's writing a book and not just dismissing us.  :-)<br><br>I like it when he's gone, he comes back with cool stuff.  Probably benefits from getting away from the noise.<br></div>
