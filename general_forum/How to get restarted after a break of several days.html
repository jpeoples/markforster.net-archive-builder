<div class="content">As a full-time university student I've been reading Mark's website for a few years now and his SuperFocus system is what kept me going the longest so far. I've been using it since January.<br><br>However, I notice (also with previous TM systems) that when I'm in a period with few real deadlines or classes, I am vulnerable to 'forgetting' to do the system. First it's one day where I'm having a nice free day with friends or something, then it's a second day where I'm doing random stuff on my computer or whatever. In the end I find myself one week later without having touched my SF book.<br><br>I lack structure in my daily life in those periods because there are no classes to go to, no deadlines that are screaming at me, and no daily habit of starting my day or something like that. I have a lot of trouble firing back up after a day or two of no SF.<br><br>SF *does* seem to work for me since I used it for at least 3 months without interruption from January to April. But since then there have been a few detrimental 'pauses' due to the issues I mentioned.<br><br>Do you guys have ideas or suggestions for me to tackle this? I read in the "How to build your own TM system" thread that you should know what the problems are with your system. Well... this is clearly my biggest problem: getting fired up again after a few day's break -or- maybe even more fundamental: preventing the system from being bypassed for a whole day.<br><br>I'm thinking that maybe I need some kind of morning ritual since that's probably where I'm least vulnerable to other people in my life controlling my actions (housemates, family). Currently the first things I do when I wake up is getting out of bed, getting in front of my computer, open up my email, facebook and news sites and getting a bowl of cereals to eat... That probably needs changing, but it's pretty well ingrained with my mornings... :-S<br><br>Thank you for your time :).<br>Cheers,<br>Tijl</div>

<div class="content">No matter how you take it, unless you are in the deliveries business, a very good practice is to open your mail after super only. This way, what you had planned for the next day doesn't get toppled over.</div>

<div class="content">You don't need a morning ritual; you *have* one!  Add SF checking to that: Set your SF book on your keyboard and make a point to read it when you see it.  Given that, there is nothing wrong with deliberately setting aside the book for a day or two.</div>

<div class="content">I keep my netbook beside my bed and the very first thing every morning, before getting out of bed, I open my OneNote notebook for Dreams and rewrite/revise my vision and my present reality. I also do the "What's better" entry for yesterday. (My partner usually brings me my first cup of coffee while I'm doing this.)<br><br>Then I go to 750words.com and start writing whatever is on my mind. Since I've been doing SF, this usually quickly becomes a dialogue, which I then copy and paste into the dialogues section of my Dreams OneNote notebook. If not, I then just directly write my dialogue into the Dreams notebook. It often springs from my review of the vision.<br><br>I have a rule not to do anything else online until after that. It's way too easy to get distracted. And I'm learning to keep email for certain times when I'm ready to deal with it. I've even stopped checking email and Facebook on my iphone while in bed. <br><br>I fall out of this ritual, too, but I now have enough history with it that I realize how much better my life goes when I'm doing this. Dreams works on feelings and it helps me to reconnect with the "Dreams" feeling and it pulls me back into the ritual.</div>
