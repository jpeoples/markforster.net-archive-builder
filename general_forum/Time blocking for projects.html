<div class="content">Hi Folks,<br><br>AF is working so well for me now that I have gone to a standard, spiral-bound notebook.  Working with paper is wonderful.<br><br>I would like to hear from Mark and others on what I am considering on doing in addition to AF.  I see AF as what I can do in my discretionary time.  But as I have posted on many occasions, I have several deadline-driven projects that usually have several tasks that have to be done by certain dates.  I have entered tasks in AF like "work on project x", and that works very well in most cases.  But with my very busy schedule, sometimes I am finding that it would be good if I simply blocked off time in my schedule for work on specific projects.  I would not work from my AF lists, although most of the tasks would already be on there, but spend a block of time working through only tasks associated with that project.<br><br>What do you think about creating these project time blocks on my calendar?<br><br>Best regards,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Put hard deadlines in your diary and review the next week or so of deadlines each day, before you start Autofocus. I think that will be better than blocking off time (something I have tried to do, but other tasks already invade it or I lose focus).</div>

<div class="content">Hi David,<br><br>Thanks for your advice.  I am already doing that, but I am thinking that for specific projects that I know I need to spend time on -- and highly focused time -- having a block of time dedicated on my calendar might be helpful.  Due to my role in administration, there are associates that have access to my Outlook calendar and meetings appear very frequently.  If I protect the time, then perhaps it would foster work on the projects that need definitive focus.<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Hi David (Drake)<br><br>I personally struggle with Time Blocks but suspect from your previous posts that they would fit very well with your way of working.  I would assume that you probably have a clear idea of the steps needed for your projects - if you have those requirements in a list format, and they are not dependant, you can action them as mini AF lists within your time blocks.  If you are able to focus in a time block then go for it!<br><br>Incidentally, when I do need to work in that way I can easily extract relevant tasks to produce a list from my OneNote AF.  Let me know if you want more details on that process.</div>

<div class="content">Hi David<br>All my life I've blocked time to devote to either a project or my studies or a chore set., practicing a skill, etc.   It protects me from distractions and interuptions but mostly it engages my focus and determination.  When I'm in these intense thinking, discovering, learning, creative modes, my entire focus is on it for that period of time to the exclusion of all else.  And....*blush* ...if I'm on a great roll, I've been known to "shift my schedule" of lesser tasks/agendas to allow me more time to take advantage of the flow going.  I block autofocus time as well!  LOL!  You're a professor......the students' schedules have their class times, lab times and study times as well as sports, music, art, art, social/family obligations, etc.....I totally agree with you.  If it's important enough to you, it goes on the calendar!  LOL!  Currently I'm far less committed, but I was taught since I was a child...you don't find the time....you make the time!  LOL!<br>I, personally, don't use autofocus for my projects of any sort, but many others do.  I've always used calendar to both meet my obligations and to further my own interests and passions!  LOL!   It's within my calendar (which is only a method of handling time...it isn't time itself!  LOL!)  that I can find my passions and my freedoms.  I don't know why it's been getting a bad rap lately....I'm not at all adverse to being flexible....I need that...but I also need to protect my obligations and pursuits from the onslaught of the rest of the world! *blush* What do you think?<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Hi learning as I go,<br><br>You make excellent points in your discussion as usual.  I too believe it is important to block off time for specific projects.  I do believe AF works well for your discretionary time.  That is the key -- DISCRETIONARY TIME!  If one wants to block off time in their busy calendar and just name it AF block time, that would work great.  I do that if I have a week that is even more booked in meetings than my normal onslaught so I can protect what little "free" time I have available.  I am now doing the same thing for specific projects that need highly focused time on my part.<br><br>Thanks for your comments and good advice.  Take care.<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Have you considered the Unschedule? (Now Habit by Dr Neil Fiore).  It is basically a reverse schedule where you time block 24 hours a day but schedule leisure time, routine, meetings etc first. The only thing you don't really block time against is your AAA priority project, which you fit into the gaps on the schedule. <br><br>What I personally like about the Unschedule is it gives a true reflection of available time - with the priority and emphasis on leisure time first and foremost. <br><br>You log time against your AAA priority project only once you have completed a full 30 minutes of uninterrupted work.  Keeping a running total of your achievements. <br><br>The Unschedule can accommodate AF or DIT without a problem and more importantly helps to establish working patterns/trends.<br><br>I know a lot of people may think scheduling 24 hours a day 7 days a week as overkill, but with the emphasis being on leisure and trying to achieve 'guilt free play' it is a surprisingly useful tool.  Consciously or subconsciously I would image people schedule 24 hours anyway. <br><br>What the Unschedule gives you is a record/log and a realistic view of time as a whole.  Compared to a normal schedule where only work time/project time is blocked. That gives the impression of more time being available than in reality.  One meeting at 14:00 doesn't mean the rest of the day is free when you take into account, sleep, routine, travel, meals, leisure etc.  Time is actually a scarce commodity when you look at in this manner - which overall I think helps you to place more value on the time you have available.<br><br>I think it is a great tool that can complement any base working system.</div>

<div class="content">David:<br><br>My own experience of time blocking is that it's fine for one big project or possibly two, but you need to avoid time blocking more than that per day. The reason: because time blocking reduces your discretionary time, and your discretionary time is when you work on your AF list.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark<br>I may be incorrect, but I think David is referring to grant funded projects.  Also, he's not merely a scientist/professor, he's HEAD of the department.  The most imposing guillotine he seems to be concerned about is making sure that FUTURE grant monies go to HIS UNIVERSITY/DEPARTMENT as opposed to elsewhere..  Success isn't preferable, it's the lifeblood of his and his peers' careers................If that pressure was on me, that time would be blocked in STEEL!  LOL!  I wouldn't chance a system based on structured procrastination on those Red Phone  obligations!  LOL!  <br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>He says some of his grants are funded by NIH.  I did lots of medical illustrations for NIH projects.  A grant from NIH is a highly prestigious honor and a GREAT cash cow if you have their respect.  Also........it can highly influence other sources of grant money to flow in your direction! LOL!  I'm sure he has other prestigious grant sources..and they can be quite fickle..... All these years hence, it still remember the MD's and Ph.D.'s really feeling under the gun with their research projects.  (I was staffed at the National Naval Medical Center's research department but I did lots of contract work at other research institutions, university hospitals, and private contracts.)  Obtaining grant money is nothing short of cut-throat!  LOL!  <br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">@ David (Drake) <br><br>David, I am so pleased you are getting on well with AF now! I do block out a certain amount of time on alternate days for specific project work and find that it does enable me to then work through items that relate solely to it and ensure progress towards a deadline or important objective.<br><br>As with you the majority of the tasks are actually already in AF so I just look at the tasks I have associated with that scheduled time (I tag them) and do an AF on those items and work on what stands out for that particular project. I have found it works brilliantly for me. It complements the AF approach but allows me to ensure that I do have some clear time kept to move important items on in small steps. It has definitely demonstrated benefits in how those projects/tasks (in their macro sense) are progressing.<br><br>Hope that helps!</div>

Learning as I go was simply stating that my kind of work sometimes is very deadline-driven and demanding...something that I have said all along.  <br><br>I am taking your advice -- which is what I was doing already -- and scheduling maybe one major porject block per day -- and the remainder of my discretionary time is then dedicated to AF.<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">David:<br><br>Sorry if I sounded snippy. I was trying to be brief and concise in responding to Learning's remark:<br><br>"I wouldn't chance a system based on structured procrastination on those Red Phone obligations"<br><br>I wasn't saying that you weren't trusting the system. I was saying that *if* you didn't trust the system it would be better to abandon it altogether.<br><br>The point being that if one doesn't trust the system to deliver on time, then one is going to end up with all one's time blocked out and not enough discretionary time left in which to work the system properly. In which case it would be better to drop the system altogether because in those conditions it *won't* deliver.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>Thanks for your comments.  You have really made me sit back and think about what system will ultimately work the best for my work schedule.  I really do like AF and it is wonderful for folks that have a lot of discretionary time.  Unfortunately, I do not fit into that category and I am finding it more difficult as the days go on to use AF properly.  A slow day for me would be 4-5 meetings.  As a result, I am finding I have to schedule more and more tasks and projects tightly to ensure that I am making enough progress on all of them.  My considerable administrative responsibilities are only going to get worse over time with all of the wrenching budget issues all of us are facing.<br><br>So what am I saying?  I may use some form of AF....I don't know.  But I do know that I am going to have to move more towards a structured scheduling approach.<br><br>At any rate, I will hang out here some no matter what I do as this is nice therapy for me and a brief escape.  I so much enjoy reading about what others are doing with AF.<br><br>Take care,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">@David, i am Head of a small R&D department (only 13 team members), but i have to coordinate many projects, incidents, money, ressources, ...<br><br>Most of the time i have no discretionary time. This week every minute of my days have either been meetings, jobs to meet a deadline, or reactions to some near catastrophic events. Every day 10 to 12 hours work (plus commuting, trying to eat something)<br><br>My AF list has been growing since two weeks with no time to work on them. I was really frustrated. <br><br>Today i had one hour discretionary time. First i did not manage to open my AF list. But then i did, and boy am i glad i did! First of all i discovered that i already did some of the tasks on that list without checking them of. Free rewards ;-). Then i managed to work on some of those tasks, checked them of, and again that feeling of reward. I know without AF i wouldn't have worked on any of those tasks (using GTD before).<br><br>Today i found out, that AF is not my primary tool (that is my calendar), but that it is my most important tool. It manages to get things done that would otherwise not get any attention. <br><br>Now i feel ready for my weekend.<br><br>Steffen<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Steffen,<br><br>I am glad this works for you and I am intrigued.  Mark made it clear that for the system to really work the way it should one must have enough discretionary time to do so.  I am like you in that because of my hectic schedule, too many tasks and projects have to be block scheduled for them to be done.  Mark stated that this is not using AF the way it was intended.<br><br>I guess I am feeling that I will have to abandon AF if this is the case.  I really did have the impression that it was working to a point, but then deadlines and time crunches have made me here recently resort to more scheduling of project time per my previous post.  <br><br>Mark -- what do you think?  What does a person like me and Steffen do?  I am sure there are untold thousands more like us that do not have a lot of discretionary time.<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Hi David<br><br>If I can add my twopence worth ..... :-)<br><br>there is no doubt that AF works in discretionery time but in my experience the system can and does work with erratic discretionery time - and with much smaller amounts of discretionery time than would be imagined.  <br><br>Firstly, the system itself is very simple to maintain, and the addition of new tasks can be included within even the smallest amount of time.  Even if you just have a short break between meetings you can add tasks, perhaps action a couple of phone calls, check email or this forum, or action a "Thinking Time" task.  Each time you visit the forum you are using some form of discretionery time as are we all.  That may be a few snatched minutes but it is enough to do something.  By having AF as a tool in those situations you can therefore "achieve" in even the smallest of time slots.<br><br>Secondly, you need to find the way of using AF that works for you.  It has taken you a degree of experimenting to find that "paper" AF is your tool of choice and over the past couple of weeks you have clearly found that to work well.  Whatever amounts of discretionery time you have used it in you have found it to work - don't give up on that benefit because you feel you are not able to spend as much discretionery time as others.  We all have different time requirements but we also all have 24 hours per day - no more, no less.  If I have 2 hours of discretionery time a day and someone else has 4 then our usage and perhaps rate of return may vary, but whatever discretionery time we have, and however minimal the length of those time blocks, the best tool for maximising output in those times is AF.<br><br>Thirdly, we all have different tasks, different styles of working, and different structure to our days.  Where tasks require intensive periods the by all means schedule time accordingly - there is nothing to stop you creating and using task (project) specific AF lists for use in that time if that would be appropriate.  Where you do not have pressing needs for action then schedule an AF time block as you have done previously.<br><br>Don't let yourself get thrown off track by feeling you are somehow doing it wrong if you do not have much time or need to schedule project time.  I had some unexpected time today and have gotten through 10 pages of my list so far - and they were all pages that have been well visited previously so not easy pages.  Unfortunately, after a particularly tiring week, my energy levels have been fairly low, so rather than giving up and doing nothing, I took regular breaks by visiting the forum which always helps keep my motivation high.  Procrastination? Technically yes as on only one occasion was it on my active page, but as it is for me a specific way in which I use my shortest discretionery time periods anyway, I feel happy to use it as another tool in my Time Management toolkit, for use whenever needed.<br><br>Hope that helps a little David ........ :-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine<br>Ditto to David's sentiments.  I can't remember the threads, but you and Jacqueline helped me to find where AF does for me and how to implement it according to my needs and proclivities. *blush*  I block AF time for those things that aren't timebound, already habituated, needing or desiring focused attention and determination for a stretch of time.  I actually look forward to my little AF time blocks. It's actually rather fun and useful ....I look forward to it either as a break from an intense period of focus or from a pain bout.  These are the niggling little things that help to keep things ship shape yet don't require systematic routines.  True, it's NOT pure AF at all.  Rather it's another useful tool I use to conduct my life as best as I can.  I do not mean to offend anybody but I always need to experiment and then draw my own conclusions. *blush*....After all, if it works differently for me, where's the harm.  I thank you for the encouragement to find my own usefulness and my own best practices.  As David expressed....Outlier......ouch!  Like David (and I suspect many others as well), I simply  want to reap the benefits of implementing AF in a manner than complements my personality and needs.

<div class="content">@Christine B.<br><br>"Firstly, the system itself is very simple to maintain".<br><br>THAT is it. I could not tell why AF is working for me, but that is the point. I have my AF list with me in every meeting, putting things not strictly related to one of my projects (there are always lot of sidetracks) on the list. And because there is no weekly review, no reordering, no extra planning, no extra burden, AF works if you have very little time.<br><br>So, David, maybe AF is especially well suited for people with a tight schedule?<br><br>Maybe i might also answer Learning as i go's question. I am using AF for everything that has no deadline. On the job and for everything private. <br><br>My private AF list is full with actions for our next vacation, the birthday party of my daughter (there is a deadline, but it is two weeks ahead and i have enough discretionary private time to trust AF with that), stuff like that.<br><br>On my job i am using three 'tools'. First my calendar. Second a reminder tool (OneAlert) for things that can only be done at a certain time, like a call to a client, and for follow-ups. Third AF for the rest. So i guess i have planned tasks, triggered tasks, and tasks where i am in control of when they are done.<br><br>Steffen<br></div>

Maybe I'll add it to AF also, but usually just the project folder.<br><br>All my active projects already have an entry in AF: "Work on Project X" or "Clear emails for Project Y" or whatever.  <br><br>If I'm not sure if the project is already in AF, or I want to give it a bit more emphasis, then I'll just add the "Work on Project X" again to AF, as I put the action item into the Project X folder.<br><br>Folders in this case can be virtual (on disk, or in Outlook) or physical (on shelf or in filing cabinet).  I've developed a little shorthand nomenclature to help me remember which is which.  If it's in Outlook, I write it in brackets, e.g. "[In box]" means "Clear Outlook in box".  If it's in Gmail, I write "@In box".  Etc.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Seraphim,<br><br>Thanks for your response.  This is quite an intriguing approach and one I think I might try!  I was putting ALL of my project tasks directly into AF.  Keeping a separate project file (I think I would use Outlook 2007 for this -- or OneNote 2007 -- for all major projects -- and add the tasks into there).  I would then add the statements as you described: "work on project x" into AF.  <br><br>Hmmm...sounds intriguing.  Thanks again for your answer.<br><br>Best wishes,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">David,<br><br>You'll probably wind up using a mix of things and that seems to be what works best ... at least for me.<br><br>I do my planning on the computer (usually OneNOte these days, but it has been other things including Word Documents).  I will plan to whatever level I am comfortable with.  Then I will EITHER put the next task or just "Work on X" on AF.  It just depends on ... well, I don't know what it depends on.  Something just decides for me.<br><br>Here is an example.  For building my deck I planned it all on the computer.  If I were doing it today, I'd put "Work on Deck" most times, but I'd probably put "Buy Lumber at Lowes" for that step.  Something about that seems to me to want to be listed on the AF list, but I would not put down: "Sand Deck" ... I'd just pick up that task when I saw "Work on deck" ... I'd just kind of know that the next task to be done was to sand it.  It is one of those intuitive decisions Mark likes to talk about ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Mike for your response.  I guess I an getting somewhat confused about how much of a project is supposed to go in AF.  In DIT, Mark said that projects should be planned outside of DIT but that all tasks that are active and on your plate should be in the DIT list.  So what is different about AF?  <br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">I agree with Mike.  It can vary, from day to day, from task to task, and from project to project.  Sometimes it's a mixture.  <br><br>E.g., sometimes I have an ongoing project, with several AF entries "Work on Project A", and an Outlook folder with several tasks to accomplish, several emails that require action, several follow-ups with other people.  I work on it a bit, whenever "Work on Project A" stands out on my Autofocus list.<br><br>But then there comes some new urgent task that's part of Project A.  I put it into the "Project A" folder, as usual, but I also list it as a separate task into Autofocus, since it's urgent and needs special attention.  I might write something like "Be sure to do NNN for Project A, due Monday!"<br><br>AF is so flexible, it works so intuitively, that this kind of thing is easy.  Just try it several ways and see what works best for you.</div>

<div class="content">Hi David,<br><br>With respect, what is different about AF is that it is not DIT.  Mark has made the point several times that AF is not any system but its own and it does not help to compare it with other systems.  It is best to just follow the rules and see how it works for you and decide if you want to use it based on that.</div>

<div class="content">Hello David,<br><br>my statement was imprecise. I think i have to describe my work environment in a bit more detail first. My team and me are working on 4 long term projects. We also have to support the production departments, sales and others when they need our qualification. This is one half of my work (half engineer, half project manager). The other half is administration (money, people) and projects in administration (establish a new process, rework the standard form for monthly spendings, try to get a budget for something, ...). <br><br>I put everything regarding to our long term projects in 'project folders', just like Seraphim. These folders are called backlogs and are shared by everybody on the team. Most of the time, new actions for those backlog have their origin in a call, an email or e meeting. I can enter them directly into the backlogs. When there is no opportunity for entering them into the backlogs, i put an action into AF ("enter list from meeting minutes into backlog"). I do not have entries in my AF list of the kind "work on project x", because my part of the work is mostly scheduled (daily review, weekly review, design meetings, etc.).<br><br>Our support jobs are short term jobs, ranging from 1 hour to a few days. I put those action  onto my AF list ("tell Joel to call sales. They need help with ...", "research if production can do X instead of Y without sacrificing stability").<br><br>All actions for my administrative work are on my AF list, even if they are part of a personal project.<br><br>So, the short answer is: actions for personal projects and actions that are not part of a project are on my AF list. Actions for shared projects are on project folders.<br><br>Steffen<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Second thought:<br><br>for personal projects i do not need a special project folder, because they do not have a complicated structure. I know what status they have without consulting a project backlog. If i ever have a complicated personal project, it will make a list of goals for that project to track status, but no special action list. The actions will be on my AF list.<br> <br>Yes, i think this is my way to distinguish what goes where: personal vs. shared, goal vs. action. Personal (does not mean private) actions on my AF list, the rest on other lists.<br><br><br>Steffen<br></div>

<div class="content">David:<br><br>My "mysterious silence" was due to taking one day off - and look how many comments there are to reply to even just on this one thread. <wry grin><br><br>You asked me to let you have my thoughts on how AF works for exceedingly busy people. Well, here's a thought - we are all equally busy!<br><br>What I mean by that is that each one of us performs a sequence of actions throughout 24 hours every day. Those actions may be "Write funding report" or "Attend Meeting" or "Watch TV mindlessly" or "Sleep" but we all, whatever our circumstances, simply carry out a sequence of actions throughout the day.<br><br>So the question is not really how busy we are but what the actions are that we do. Here again it's simple. If your are using AF you write down the actions you need or wish to do. The actions again may be "Write funding report" or "Watch TV", but the sum of all the actions we perform, on or off-list, is still going to come to 24-hours. You're not really any busier than I am. Your work may be more significant than mine, but we both do 24-hours worth of actions a day.<br><br>Your real problem therefore isn't really how busy you are. It's your lack of choice. If you want to have more control of your work, then you need to increase the amount of choice you have over what you are doing at any particular time.<br><br>I'd like to write a bit more about this.

Saying that someone who watches TV or whatever and they are as busy within a 24 hour period as I am is frankly insulting.  I understand fully what you are trying to say, but please do not compare my level of responsibilities, trying to manage so much with so many deadlines, as someone who puts things like watch TV on their AF list.  This really is not helpful to me.<br><br>Now, with that said, I really do see the simplicity of what you are trying to say.

<div class="content">Thanks Seraphim, Mike, and Steffen.  Your advice is VERY helpful.  But I do have one question.  By maintaining a separate list of tasks to do OUTSIDE of AF creates two systems to maintain.  So if I am doing AF in a paper notebook and project task management in Outlook, then I have two places to check and see what is on my plate.  Does this not detract somewhat from the simplicity of maintaining one system?  <br><br>-David</div>

<div class="meta">2009-03-15 19:07</div>
<div class="content">David, <br><br>Is having a separate list of project-specific tasks in Outlook any different than a home vs work list or a shopping list or errand list etc? Don't forget you're not duplicating the items in both lists. (At least, I don't think you'd want to.) If you time block, then you may not even need a 'work on project x" on the AF list because it's on the calendar. <br><br>I don't normally timeblock for projects, but this past week at work there were a higher than usual number  of "drop everything and do this now" items which effectively timeblocked most of my day. I just closed the AF book and did the 'drop everything' tasks until they were resolved or became someone else's 'drop everything' task. I did read through the AF list when I had a spare minute (in some cases I was on a conference call at my desk) just to be sure I wasn't overlooking something that could escalate if it didn't get done sometime that day. Those tasks I squeezed in when I could. Not pure AF by any means, but as a control measure it seems to work well.  <br><br>And just curious,(and at the risk of stating the obvious) assuming you work 40-50 hours a week, do you have 40-50 hours of tasks/meetings/etc or is it more than that? I get the impression that  you have more to-do's than time, discretionary or not, to do it in. That may be a bigger problem than keeping AF vs Outlook lists</div>

<div class="content">David:<br><br>If you check what I said again you will find that I didn't say anything about your level of responsibility or the number of deadlines you have to manage.<br><br>What I was talking about was your degree of "busy-ness", and I was making the point that however many or few responsibilities one has, we are all alike filling 24 hours with a series of actions. <br><br>If one multiplies the number of actions we take during 24 hours by the average amount of time which we spend on each action, the total for every single one of us comes to 24-hours. This applies whether we are a Head of Department, a retired person, a street sweeper, a lay-about or a pre-schooler.<br><br>The difference between these various people is not the number and duration of actions, but the content of those actions. The Head of Department is doing a very different set of things from the lay-about. Yet he or she still has only 24-hours worth of tasks that they can accomplish in a day. <br><br>So what is the difference from the point of view of planning one's time between the Head of Department and the lay-about?<br><br>The answer is the word "Choice". The Head of Department actually has far less choice than the lay-about, who has no responsibilities (that they are prepared to acknowledge anyway) and no deadlines. The Head of Department has a full schedule and innumerable deadlines and responsibilities. These all restrict the amount of choice that he or she has over how they use their allocated 24-hours a day.<br><br>As I have said many times on this forum, if you have no choice about what you do then you don't need a time management system - you just do it. If you have a schedule which is completely full of meetings and appointments, then all you have to do is go from one meeting or appointment to the next. <br><br>However you are not quite in this situation. What you describe as your situation is that you have a very large amount of scheduled time over which you have no choice. Plus an inadequate amount of unscheduled time in which to fit in all the deadlines and responsibilities.<br><br>Some of these deadlines and responsibilities you simply have no choice about at all. So there remains an even smaller amount of time in which to fit in everything else.<br><br>Guess what? There is no time management system in existence which can succeed in fitting a quart into a pint pot. GED won't do it, DIT won't do it, AF won't do it. Nor will any combination of them. You've already discovered this.<br><br>So we have to go back to this word "choice" again. You have to increase the amount of time over which you are exercising choice.<br><br>To do this, you need to acknowledge that your current situation of "little or no choice" is actually something you have chosen.<br><br>You chose to arrange the meetings<br>You chose to go to them<br>You chose the other items in your schedule<br>You chose your responsibilities<br>You chose which interruptions to allow<br>etc. etc.<br><br>Now please don't misunderstand me. I'm not saying those choices were wrong, or even that they weren't necessary. I'm just saying that you need to re-establish in your mind that they were your choice - the sort of choices which it is the responsibility of a Head of Department to make. And if they were your choices, then you can make further choices about them.<br><br>And that therefore the fact that you have a totally inadequate amount of time to deal with everything that isn't absolutely essential is also your choice - and you can chose to do something about it.<br><br>The more choice you can re-establish at the level of your working day, the more AF will be able to help you.<br><br>I don't really have any answer other than that.</div>

Most just comes with the job so to speak, but again, that is my choice.  Enough said.

<div class="content">Mark, hoping you have a lovely time with your daughter! Thank you for the term "lay-about." That makes me giggle. :-)<br><br>Great discussion. Because I use a digital approach, my calendar is integrated with my AF list. If I add a deadline to a task, it's automatically added to my Google calendar. I do not keep a separate project list. The more separated things are for me, the worse they are. I have a task called "Work on GWN." I do have a GWN file that I can refer to when I am ready to work on this task. If that's what is meant by a separate list, I concur with that approach, but I put all projects into the AF list.<br><br>As far as time blocking is concerned...nearly every time I time block, I rebel against it. Of course, if other people depend on me to attend a meeting, I am there! But if I say, "Tomorrow from 10am to 12pm I am going to write," I will resist that like crazy. I think because I feel obligated to do it. Yesterday I finished a writing project that is due today. I had in mind to work on it yesterday but I never gave myself a time. That general kind of "time blocking" is much more effective for me. <br><br>Yesterday I spent no time with my list at all, but I was super productive. I really went non-stop. I think what is working for me is I don't allow myself to feel guilty about that. I don't have to use AF "perfectly." Just as though the list were a task on a larger life AF list, I use it when it feels ready to be used. <br><br>David, I wonder if my approach might be helpful to you? Or what if you used DIT during the week and AF on weekends? There are quite a few options and I think what works at one time in our lives may not work in another. KWIM? For example, I can see having to take a day off the list just to plan out every minute of an exceptionally busy day. I can't keep that up indefinitely and would return to my list asap. <br><br>Great conversation, all, and David I hope you can get some time to rejuvenate.</div>

<div class="content">I work in a Dean's office at a fairly large university, there are about 10,000 students enrolled just in our faculty alone.  I'm quite struck by our Dean's time management methods.  He delegates ALOT - asks for updates on these items - we keep it succinct, schedules regular time blocks of "Thinking Time", goes for a 2 hour run/lunch in the middle of the day every day.  When he goes on holiday for 2 weeks at a time, he takes no method of communication with the office.  Nothing really gets delayed in his absence as we are all well prepared to deal with what will come up when he's gone.  And his office is always open if you have a question about anything.  He is also highly efficient and greatly respected.  <br><br>Department Heads in our faculty range from very driven and overworked to very laid back and waiting to retire.  It's interesting to note how many different work styles there can be in much the same job and some will burn themselves out and some will not and sometimes the results of their individual efforts are not so very different.<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi David<br>I'm sure you have already heard of the 17 hour crunch.  You have 2 1/2hour meals and 4 15minute breaks however you want to lace them into the 17 hours...so you're only actually crunching for 15 hours.  Then you go strictly by the 17hour rosters that you pre-planned and just crunch them out.  When you're in this mode, you actually get FAR MORE done because you don't have to re-energize your determination to complete the roster and you don't have to worry about losing mental energy with unnecessary switching around and reorienting your cognitive sets because you already planned that in the 17 hour roster you set up.  Of course, this method is PRIME for an occasional weekend because for it to work supremely, there can't be any interruptions to make you change your cognitive mode.  Maybe you can have your secretary set up a day once in awhile for this.  It's challenging and exhausting but the trade-off is completing FAR MORE work in that mode than you would with having to be interupted.  To get the maximum bang for the buck, set up your roster with your deadlines/goals progress in mind YET ordered to get maximum cognitive efficiency.  Have the tasks benefit by flow time yet have tasks logged in that intentionally rest the brain from certain cognitive patterns yet will be a good launch pad for the next roster item.  Even set up your office and supplies to augment and complement the ease of working the roster you created.  This will certainly work for both crunching deadline work out yet......*blush* it's also a great strategy to free up a future targeted day(s).  The magic is in creating the roster to benefit your cognitive sets to flow at peak effeciency with strategic breaks which are actually other tasks that provide relief to your brain without wasting productivity. I was also known to use this method for my own greedy ends such as making huge money to pick up other people's slack or desperation....or to create time for a mini-vacation!  LOL!  When I'd get the thought to start flagging, I'd just visualize the carrot!  LOL!<br>Of course, this isn't an everyday solution....but it's a wonderful tool.

You could create a mini roster to follow. Aim for top efficiency and speed with your determination set to HIGH and HARD!  LOL!  You'd be surprised how your output will be exponentially increased because of your pre-planned roster working with your cognitive skills flowing instead of willy nilly transitioning.  People don't realize how much cognitive energy one loses with transistioning different cognitive processes and having to change to different parts of your knowledge base.  This method increases output quite a bit.....sort of like taking the freeway instead of an urban street with lots of stop lights, having to be mindful of turns, traffic, etc...

<div class="content">Hi David,<br><br>You asked about offloading projects to a separate list or folder, and how that could lead to maintaining "two systems".<br><br>It doesn't really work that way for me.  Basically here's how I do a typical project.<br><br>(1) I get an email.  It includes a task related to Project A.  I can't do (or don't want to do) the task right this minute.  So I flag it with a red flag (in Outlook), and put it in the folder for Project A.<br><br>(2) Project A is already an important project for me, and I deal with it several times a day (based on AF prompting), so I know I'll get to it sometime soon.<br><br>(3) If the task is especially important, I might do a double entry in AF: "Be sure to do XXX for Project A".<br><br>(4) As I work my AF list, I come across "Work on Project A".  If I just worked on it a short time ago, and the flagged items in that folder are pretty fresh in my mind, and I know it can wait a bit longer, then all that comes into play in the "standing out" process.  Basically, if that's the state of the project, it just won't stand out, or I'll skip right through it, saying to myself, "That can wait".<br><br>(5) But if I haven't processed that Project A folder for a while, and I'm losing track of it; or maybe I have a suspicious nagging feeling that there's something important I should do there -- then, it stands out.  And I go take a look and see what flagged items are there.<br><br>(6) That alone counts as taking action, so maybe that's the only thing I'll do -- basically refresh my mind on what's in there.<br><br>(7) But usually I'll spend some time clearing the flagged items, taking action, delegating as needed, writing email responses, etc.  When I clear an item, I just click on the flag, changing it from "Red' to "Complete".  That way the email is still there if I ever need it -- but it's hidden, since I have a filter for my project folders that shows only the flagged emails.<br><br>(8) If I start getting a huge collection of flagged emails, and I am feeling overwhelmed by it, I'll add a new task to AF: "Deal with Project A, it's getting behind" or something like that.  I might resist it for a while, since it's a pain to deal with at that point, but eventually I've had enough of fighting the resistance, and go clear 50 emails all at once.  Usually only takes a few minutes by that point.  :-)<br><br><br>So, I suppose you could call my system of processing emails, flagging them, putting them in project folders, etc., a "separate system".  But it doesn't feel that way at all.  It just fits right into the overall AF framework.<br><br>That's another reason I like AF so much.  I've handled emails and projects using this system of flags, for years.  And AF just lets me do whatever already works for me -- just helps me do it better, and gives me a single central "control center" to manage everything.<br><br>Hope that helps!</div>

<div class="content">Thanks to Mark, learning as I go, and Seraphim for great advice!!  I have created electronic folders in Outlook for major projects and I am doing things per what Seraphim suggested.  I also will schedule major time blocks for dedicated work if it becomes necessary.  <br><br>Thanks again!<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Hi David<br>Isn't it curious how the brain works? LOL!  If you'll read your first post, it pretty much aligns with your final decision.  I think you only needed to beef up your surety a bit with a bit of brainstorming to see what shook out.  It really does make a huge difference in how successfully you implement your decision(s)...especially the meta choices of systems procedures and it's subsets of operational "tools".........It sounds as though you've finally got this one in the bag!  LOL!<br>Even when you have to work under the gun , it always goes much better when you feel confident with your methodology...... and not second guessing your operational means!<br><br>I'll part with an Einstein quote I saw hanging over the Haz Mat warning sign in the microbiology lab down the hall from our office......<br><br>Science is a wonderful thing if one does not have to earn one’s living at it<br><br>learning as I go<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi David<br><br>I've been out of the forum for a couple of days and wow - there have been so many entries on this post!  I've already sent you some info on project management and OneNote which I hope will be of help to you, and see that there has been a lot of good advice flowing to you through this thread.  <br><br>The only other thing I would say is to remember that we do not all work in the same way.  One thing I know is that, whilst I can be incredibly productive in time blocks, I need the flexibilty of deciding spontaneously when those time blocks are.  Building them into a schedule creates immediate resistance for me.  However I sense that you work well with structured time blocks and AF works in those those time blocks just as well, whether they are predetermined or spontaneous.  Don't feel you have to do things a certain way because that works for me, or for Seraphim, or for Mark but find the way in which it works for you.  Yes there are fixed rules which need to be followed but within those rules is an incredible amount of flexibility and I think it is easy to lose sight of that.<br><br>I've certainly found that I will suddenly have a moment of panic when I think I should be doing something else, and I deviate from the system and just fall flat on my face.  Going back to AF as it is written - but in the way that it works for me - is always such a relief.  Given the immediate impact for me of AF from day one of beta - I sometimes feel incredibly stupid that I allow myself to get sidetracked - but we all do it :-) At least I think we do - or perhaps it is just that I am incredibly stupid ....hmmm...<br><br>Timeblocks or individual tasks, that is a matter of choice - as has been said AF works with discretionery time but sometimes we have more of that than we realise.  If in a day of say 10 hours when you have meetings for 4 and work on projects for 4 you could consider yourself to have only 2 hours of discretionery time ......... or you could consider yourself to have 6 hours of discretionery time and use AF on your projects for 4 out of the 6 hours.  It's all in the way you "do AF".  <br><br>Hope the OneNote info was of help - let me know if anything needs further clarification.  Good luck!<br><br>ps A few "away from the office" tasks in AF, like hiking in the mountains or walking on the beach are a good idea to keep us focused on the fact that too much work is not good :-) <br></div>

<div class="content">Hi learning as I go<br><br>I have to say when I first read your post about the 17 hour crunch it filled me with horror! I wanted to run for the hills!  My intense dislike of being told when to do something yelled "noooo!"  Then I remembered a few times when I was a departmental manager and we had a backlog build up.  Periodically we would do an "all-nighter" - we would work all day, continue into the evening and all through the night.  About 9:00 pm we would call out for pizza; there was a real party atmosphere, and there was something exhiliarating about still being there when the rest of the office turned up for work the next day.  We usually worked through 'til the afternoon and left around 3 or 4 but as it was a team effort we really had fun - and got a lot done!<br><br>I still think I would struggle with a preset timeblock on my own - but that is my personality, not that it is not a good tool.  However, if there were a group of us I think it would be totally different - the Myers Briggs E factor kicking in I suspect!<br><br>Thanks, learning, for making me think ...... :-)  <br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine<br>Sometimes I'm a bit inarticulate or i unintentionally leave out details.  I wasn't discussing a backlog at all......quite the opposite!!!!!  These 17hour crunches were to meet deadlines.  In a deadline driven business, getting behind means getting fired!  LOL!  We'd do this as a department when there were many submittals for the same symposium, convention or the researchers were trickling and refining up until publication deadline all of their work and then had to bridge it into one body of work.  They consulted us on these matters as we made our living doing this....their expertise was medicine and research.<br>I only WISH we EVER had the luxury of creating any backlog at all!  LOL!  Medical research is highly exacting and competetive....and medical illustrators need to be willing to maintain exacting standards and be willing to work in sometimes almost impossible circumstances with far less pay than the MDs but far more pay than most of the PhDs (if you're talented and driven to excel).  That might be why some MDs started out studying medical illustration but decided to add one more year of schooling to get the big bucks!  (plus internship and residency)training)  Also, there are only a few schools and the selection process is HARD  and getting employed at an institution is even harderLOL! You have to LOVE it to even want it .  I learned to love it because it mixed science with art.I enjoyed the challenges yet I'm glad to be done with it now!  *blush*  (I was labeled an adrenaline junkie by an MD when he looked at my MRI's and saw all of my sports injuries.  Yet, I found my profession to call on me MUCH HARDER than ariel skiing, hang gliding, cliff diving, scubs diving under ice, in wrecks, etc.....These were relaxing breaks compared to the pressure cooker invironment I worked in.  ....just ask David Drake....I'm sure he experiences much of the same pressure!  LOL!  <br>Now it's hard for me to live in this body and brain....yet parts of me have never changed...I feel like I've been jailed for doing no crime!  I can't act on my normal personality and drives.....yet, I'm slowly resenting it a little bit less.... *blush*<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>Most of the time I put this on myself......many of the other artists just made do with their 8am to 4:30pm x 5 days a week timeframes.  Yet, luckily for me, my supervisor had a similar drive as me.  We wanted to get CHALLENGING and EXCITING work so we intentionally proved ourselves to be exacting and willing to go the extra mile.  Why?  two main reasons....1.  when we picked up the other artist's slack, we could command FAR great compensation.....we were OFF the clock and would charge by the piece!  LOL!<br>Secondly, as our reputation grew and our work appeared in important journals, seen at symposiums or in books, the docs started spreading the word how last minute deadline crunches didn't affect the quality of our work.  The added benefit was.......the other artists got more of the scutwork jobs and we got more of the fun and challenging jobs!  LOL!   Heck, I'm glad to avoid as much scutwork coming my way as possible as a hidden bonus!  LOL!  (scutwork is important yet dull work that must be done but doesn't require your expertise.....i.e. boring yet exacting crap like schematics, electrical drawings, data graphs  and charts, etc!  LOL!)<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Mark posted on choice above and I thought this was relevant.<br><br>Nathaniel Branden (the self esteem guy) came out with a great book about 10 years ago called "Taking Responsibility".  He has a small but powerful section where he addresses time management specifically.  He uses a system called sentence completion (I think I've seen Mark do this in one of his books as well) to get to the root of issues - because you have the answers in you.  <br><br>The sentence stem is "If I take responsibility for how I prioritize my time - ".<br><br>Then you just write 6-10 endings for this every day for a week or so.  You'll probably end up with somewhat different answers every day.  You may end up naturally making changes from what you discover or you may have to consciously make some changes based on what you've discovered.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueling<br>I journal almost every day and sometimes I'll free associate from questioning much like you've mentioned.  BTW, I read Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead more than once!  It was part of the usual metaphysics stage most young folks go through!  LOL!  *blush*<br>I don't know why my progress is so slow.....I'm sure it's because I'm resisting accepting the hard fact that I need to alter more of my mental landscape than I want to!  *blush*  I've always been hard worker with a Bohemian attitude!  LOL!  I always got what I want to be, do or get with naked determination.  Alas, that same determination doesn't do squat because I'm trying to fight against my circumstances more than trying to find my grace within them.....easier said than done....but I'm still trying....<br>Thanks for reminding me of Brandon's works....(although I think he can be a  pendantic tyrant, he does offer much to ponder about.......I might try composing a few questions as I would guess he would......thanks again for expanding my reaches ( I forget FAR more than I can retain..............GEEEZ, this is what I hate!

<div class="content">"Self-esteem guy"  ROTF ;-)  Fascinating the things people get tagged with.  But yeah, right out of his association with Any Rand.<br><br>"Pedantic tyrant."  ROTFLMAO ;-)  Yeah, he is just a bit rigid.  But consider his pedigree ... he was a colleague of Ayn Rand and she was just a tad inflexible in her view of the world ... to say the least.  That said, there is a lot of common sense in Branden's writings.<br><br>As to "stems" that is a very old concept and used in many contexts ... not at all unique to Branden.  It is a very good way of uncovering what is going on subconsciously.  Another that Branden has written (or talked) about is the simple process of repeatedly asking questions and demanding answers.  One really open ended one is "What do I really want?"  Try saying that a few hundred times a day for a month and see what shakes out ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline and Mike:<br><br>The thing that fascinates me about the "sentence stems" is that if you hadn't tried it you would probably think that you'd write more or less the same thing every day. But when you do try it it's incredible how every day - without any mental strain - one comes up with new stuff so that there's hardly any repetition.</div>

<div class="content">Hi, again, Mike<br>My kaleidescopic mind focused more on the guru's works than her boink boy protege's.  I've read some of his stuff but it didn't really click as a system of thought that could act as any sort of usable template for my established principles nor my quests......I did get some good nuggets from him but, alas......they were mostly replaced by other nuggets more relavent to me.......but I do remember his questioning methods to discover/better define one's governing principles and values system and the experiences that helped/hindered to shape them.  I would guess that Autofocus works quite similarly in a different context.  hmmmmm.....me thinks Autofocus might serve quite well for this sort of thing........THANK YOU, Mike.....I've got a new experiment.....this might really be effective!  Mark might be able to market or elicit research into Autofocus as an effective prescribed  short-term dynamic psychotherapy!  He might make a fortune from the HMO's   I may be joking a bit but there might also be a grain of promise....<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">I had a recipe box full of Branden's cards and about 4 stems on each that I did every day for about a year first thing in the morning.  I had excellent results and highly recommend the practice.  Mark, if you think of any that you would think would work well with Autofocus specifically, could you please pass them on?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br>My favorite question that I put on my daily list (not every day...but often).....is his "What's better?"  You know that it's on your list, so you set out to make something better or experience some event/person that makes that day better (and possibly more!)  The better can be any sort of improvement!  It's a wonderful focusing and motivational tool.  It's also a WONDERFUL mood changer.  If I'm suffering enough or just plain flagging, that's my cue to write it on the list and go about changing both my attitude and the landscape of the day at least enough to be able to create a good response!  Sometimes it also spurs on more lasting kinds of improvements projects from any category of life....not only productivity!<br>My very favorite tool is  his Current Initiative.  I love both and both continue to add to the quality of my life. His backlogs buster is pure gold also!   THANK YOU, Mark!<br>learning as I go</div>
