<div class="content">Hello there,<br><br>I'm reading DIT for the first time and finding it very interesting and helpful.  I have a question about the processing of emails.<br><br>In the book Mark recommends turning off email notifications to minimise distractions, and to batch process the previous day's email once a day.<br><br>What I'm unsure about is how to identify emails that require an 'immediate' or 'same day' response or action?  Is the idea to periodically skim through today's incoming email and identify the ones which you can't leave until tomorrow, then make a note to deal with these 'below the line' in the task diary?</div>

<div class="content">Tony:<br><br>Read the beginning of Chapter 15 which deals with this very point.<br><br>Hope this helps. Don't hesitate to ask any further questions.</div>

<div class="content">I'm a slow reader... I've only just gotten to chapter 12. But I love all of it so far. I'd already discovered a few of those concepts on my own (like the directive not to react to every stimulus right away), but a lot of them - especially the "open list vs closed list" example of Joe Slob and Mick Cool - have been real eye-openers!</div>

<div class="content">Hello Mark, thank you for replying!<br><br>I've only just finished chapter 11 so I probably should have finished the book before I asked the question (oops!)<br><br>But thanks anyway, I'll do that.<br><br>@JulieBulie,<br><br>Completely agree.  This book is just blowing me away, it's brilliant.</div>

<div class="content">I'm still not done yet, but I read chapter 13 yesterday, which said (among other things) it's better to take a break when you're in the middle of something, because "the mind craves completion."<br><br>Gaaaah!! That makes so much sense. So there's yet another thing I've been doing wrong, wrong, wrong for decades!</div>
