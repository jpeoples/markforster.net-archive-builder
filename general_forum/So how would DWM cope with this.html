<div class="content">On Sat am I missed a parcel delivery and was a left a royal mail collection card.<br>I entered "collect parcel" as a new task @sat+1m in DWM<br><br>Now I want to collect the parcel on Monday am as I'm interested to see what it is, but that's just a want.<br><br>I need to collect the parcel within 7 days or it gets returned to sender.<br><br>My worry is with DWM that I may not get to the 'collect parcel' task on Monday to satisfy my want (but that's okay) or by Saturday to satisfy my need (that's not okay) simply because of the volume of 'stand-out' tasks between me and the 'collect parcel' task.<br><br>I realise I don't have to wait for 30 days to do the task btw.<br><br>Perhaps this is covered off by reading through the whole list first?<br>Or maybe by the addition of the next pass marker?<br><br>Although there is still no gaurantee I'll ever get that far into the list in time.</div>

<div class="content">Maybe I'm completely wrong, but my understanding of AF and DWM was that these methods are best suited for tasks that can be done during discretionary time, and not for time sensitive tasks that have only a small time window. So I would simply schedule the task 'collect the parcel' in a calendar and not put it on the DWM list.</div>

<div class="content">Well, you've got a week. I'd put something like,<br><br>Collect parcel by [Wednesday] on my list and see what happens.</div>

<div class="content">I agree with Rainer.  In an ideal world, anything time sensitive would go into my diary.</div>

<div class="content">Seems to me that "not getting thru" your list in one week is a problem.  If you are following DWM, that means one of two things is happening:<br>1) You are doing your tasks in order from day 1.<br>2) Tasks are falling off as you are stuck in the middle of weeks 2-4 for several days, and not getting back to the start of your list.<br><br>If DWM is going to work for you, you need to be able to pass through your list faster.  If you ever get bogged down for a day, it's time to switch to overdrive and get through that list in an hour:  Remind yourself what's urgent; do what's urgent and quick.  Then don't let yourself get stuck again if you have urgent tasks ahead.  (i.e. let this knowledge influence your "standing out" and "little and often" to keep you going.)<br><br>If that doesn't work, you need a shorter list with only important things.</div>

<div class="content">Since you are worried about missing your package, I assume you aren't yet comfortable with how you use and react to DWM.  So I would propose two things:<br><br>1.  Put it on your calendar for Friday or Saturday (the latest day that you could get it based on the office is open and your other hard commitments).  This is your fail safe mechanism since you aren't confident in DWM.<br><br>2. Put "Collect Parcel [by Apr 3]" on your DWM list for @Sat + 1M.  Brackets with a due date was recommended for noting hard deadlines.  It makes it a bit obvious when going through your list.  For me, I use square brackets since it makes them look completely different than any of my sloppy writing.<br><br>On a day when you think you might have time and desire or if your deadline is getting close, you can add the Next Pass marker if you want that prompt as well.<br><br>Good luck.  Let us know if you get your  package via DWM or Calendar/Diary.</div>

<div class="content">Mark has always been quite explicit: If you have a "hard deadline" or an "appointment" it goes in your calendar.</div>

<div class="content">Thank you for all your very useful replies.<br><br>I guess I was lured in by the fact I'd read you could throw anything at DWM. Which obviously isn't strictly true.<br><br>Although I agree with the suggestions about powering through the list faster, I'll try to implement that. My list is artifically long right now as I loaded my backlog in at +1m to let DWM sort it out for me which seems to be panning out nicely.<br><br>Part of my brain is definitely still wondering why I shouldn't just enter 'collect parcel' on Apr 2nd rather than +1m. That way I'm almost certain to get to it before time and if not it will be on my Today page on the last day of its deadline giving me a concious decision to go get it ot let it get returned. Seem logical no?<br><br>Although of course it does violate the rules.<br><br>G</div>

Two, he thought the reason it didn't work was that it turned every page into a potential open list.  It seemed to work better to keep all pages closed, except the +7 and +1M pages.<br><br>What I've been doing, is adding items to the specified page on my DWM list (either +7 or +1M, depending on the circumstances), and then also adding a reminder in Outlook to remind me of the deadline.<br><br>That said, I've been thinking of trying adding the item to the page where it is due, and see how it goes.  These deadlined items don't seem to be numerous enough to really throw off the closed-list effect, at least for me.</div>

<div class="content">I'm electronic, but I have been using real due dates when applicable for the past week or so. I like how it has been working so far.</div>

<div class="content">Mike,<br><br>"Mark has always been quite explicit: If you have a "hard deadline" or an "appointment" it goes in your calendar."<br><br>Not sure I agree. <br><br>As I understand it, Mark always intends to get tasks done well before the deadline. You might put a backstop reminder in a couple of days before the deadline, but I think he puts the date in the task itself so he gives himself a chance to do it earlier.<br><br>The calendar generally holds things which need to be done at a certain time and reminders to think about things which can't be done now.<br><br>Peace and Love,<br><br>Will</div>

<div class="content">I tried putting items on their actual due dates at the start and it really did just confuse the issue.  <br><br>Two months into DWM I have had no problems with missed deadlines, even for external time-sensitive things like going to the post office, by entering them into the list on page M.  For most errand-type things of that sort, they get entered into the list and when there's a critical mass of them, I break them out into a separate "errands" list and re-enter the task "run errands" on page W.<br><br>The things I use the calendar for are things that have to be done at a very specific time.  And as a tickler to cycle things into the list.</div>

<div class="content">I tend to agree that the calendar should be for meetings only in whatever format.<br><br>The main attraction of DWM is that it's supposed to take everything thrown at it?<br><br>I'll put my deadlines in and see what happens. I'm also aware that my lists are very skewed right now and it will even out more as time passes and more tasks are reentered at +7<br><br>Thanks again for all valuable comments.</div>
