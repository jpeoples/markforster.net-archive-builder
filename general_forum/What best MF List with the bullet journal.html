<div class="content">Recently, I discovered the bullet journal method. I find it great because it helps me to have at a glance all my engagements and make planification easier. It is much better for me than GTD I used for 10 years but find very complicated. I've never been acustomed to it. <br><br>So I made a kind of diary from monday to sunday. Weekly calendar. It takes from page to 63 to page 65 - 2 days per page ie Monday and tuesday are on page 63 (half a page) <br><br>On page 66 I have a MF list. I drop here every thing as it comes to my mind from projects no ideas and also quick notes. This helps me to make my planification on a daily basis. This list will be a weekly list. I will close it on sunday night<br><br>I wich I could treat this page with MF method what could be the best for it AF1 ? AF 4 ? FV ? others ? Thanks for helping ;-)</div>

<div class="content">I think any of the methods you mention will work. When you close the week will you forward the unfinished tasks? <br><br>I kept a Bullet Journal for a few years. It felt like a lot of work to keep it going. The part I liked best was the doodles and sketches that made their way into all the lists and writing. <br><br>Let us know how it goes.</div>

<div class="content">Bullet Journal did not work for me, but when I used it I used FVP.<br><br>These days I highly recommend the Bounce!</div>

<div class="content">I've been itching to combine the Bullet-Journal with Autofocus, I think that Autofocus will bring the impetus that Bullet-Journaling lacks.</div>

<div class="content">I've been using Bullet Journal for about 18 months. I have been migrating tasks each new month, which serves also as a purging of stuff I'm not really going to do.<br><br>For the tasks in BJ, I've been using the simple scanning method, but I came here this morning wondering if there might be a better method. I've tried many of MF's systems over the years.</div>
