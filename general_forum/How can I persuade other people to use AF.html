<div class="content">One problem with adopting this system is that suddenly everybody else in your life seems unbearably disorganized and unproductive. Is anybody else feeling this way? What are you doing to get other people using AF to manage their time, and have you had any success?<br><br>Even before using AF, I was amazed how many people would complain of being overwhelmed with tasks and work, but would refuse to write a list or identify manageable actions and do them. It's like a resistance to change, or as if people grow to depend on their backlog of work somehow. I feel bad for people in that situation, and it's also frustrating for me!<br><br>Any advice?<br><br>Dave</div>

<div class="content">PS I don't mind people not doing anything if that is what they enjoy. It's specifically people who feel bad about their lack of progress that I'm talking about here.</div>

<div class="content">I think the best way is by example - when people see you becoming magically organized that is the best advertisement of all.  I've certainly had friends comment on my improved efficiency and the fact that I have demonstrable results is evidence in itself.  There's nothing like talking face to face with people about some of the tips etc. :-)</div>

<div class="content">Funny you should mention this. The other day, I added a list of people I needed to tell about AF to my AF notebook. :-D<br><br>I intend to tell them about AF and, as they see how it works for me, maybe they'll want to try it themselves.</div>

<div class="content">To quote another guru of productivity, you can only work inside your circle of influence.  If other people aren't into trying to be more productive, then you can't make them.  And it is a really boring thing to hear about if you are not interested in it, like other people's kids.<br><br>Equally, I have a friend who has gone GTD hardcore and is really productive and ultra-reliable.  People go up to him to ask him is secret.</div>

<div class="content">To answer your original question: DON'T! It won't work anyway. Trying to get people to change or do things when they don't really want to is a bad idea. You can't change other people, only yourself, so your real question is "how can I learn to live with people who suddenly seem so very disorganised and inefficient?" ;o)<br><br>The only thing you can do that goes towards what you'd like is what has been said above: model by example and point people towards AF if they are asking. But there it stops. Remember, you can only lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink...</div>

<div class="content">Dave:<br><br><<I was amazed how many people would complain of being overwhelmed with tasks and work, but would refuse to write a list or identify manageable actions and do them.>><br><br>That is something that I've noticed when giving seminars in organisations where the people attending have been told to be there. There are many people who are very resistant to making any changes in the way they work. It is as if being extremely busy, having a huge work load and always being on the verge of overwhelm is in some way important to their self-image. In fact I found that people were very protective of their work loads. <br><br>That's why I much prefer to give seminars where the people are there because they want to be!</div>

<div class="content">Coincidentally, I attended a time management workshop today organized by my own employer. I suppose I was quite resistant to any systems that contradicted Autofocus.<br><br>We looked at the Covey matrix: urgent, non urgent, important, non important. I know that without any system at all, it is extremely tempting to work on urgent unimportant tasks all the time -- you feel busy, you make colleagues happy, but you aren't doing anything that puts you in a risky position if it goes wrong.<br><br>Maybe people fear a system because they know it would move them away from those seductive but pointless tasks.</div>
