<div class="content">I've been using Andreas Maurer's wepapp at <br><a href="http://www.andreasmaurer.net/public/apps/fvp/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.andreasmaurer.net/public/apps/fvp/</a> for some time now with great success.  <br><br>It seems to have been down for about a week?<br><br>A similar site I also use, nowdothis.com , is also down. I don't expect anyone here will know anythig about it, but it doesn't hurt to ask.<br><br>I'm missing my tools!</div>

<div class="content">It seems to be the whole of Andreas's site that's down, not just the app.<br><br>I might have his email address somewhere. I'll take a look and if I can find it I'll ask him what the problem is.<br><br>He posted not that long ago in the Forum - November 1st to be exact.</div>

<div class="content">Hi MotherWit,<br><br>it should be back up. Can you check whether it's working for you?<br><br>Apparently there was a short power outage and the server didn't recover properly. My apologies.<br><br>Regards,<br>Andreas</div>

<div class="content">I'm delighted to rediscover your app, Andreas. I'm excited to try it out. Is there a way to switch modes? I selected the list mode and now can't figure out how to go back to the question mode. Thanks!</div>

<div class="content">Lenore:<br><br>There should be a button with an X at the top right if you are viewing the list, which closes it. The app was made with the philosophy to have you focus at one choice between two tasks or one current task, so there aren't really modes, the list view is just there to get a quick overview and for removing tasks efficiently, not to actually work in.</div>

<div class="content">Andreas's whole site is down; I haven't been able to use the webapp since before Christmas.  Before Thanksgiving, maybe?  Funny, that's the same time it went down last year.  I hope all is well with him.</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br>Thanks again for notifying me, I'm on it.<br><br>MotherWit:<br><br>Sorry for the inconvenience. Please feel free to inform me immediately when the app stops working. Either here or you can reach me via email by adding "mail@" before my domain name.<br><br>If you'd like, we can figure something out for you to have your own version of the app so you don't have to rely on my website.</div>
