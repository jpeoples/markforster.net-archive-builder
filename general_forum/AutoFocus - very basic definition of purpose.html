<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">Along my thoughts on joining up AF and project planning, I was wondering about the declared goal of AutoFocus.  What is it supposed to do?  What is it intended to cover?  What is it not supposed to do?  What is it not intended to cover?<br><br>Either I have somehow missed this point so far, or AutoFocus has never been precisely defined relating to what it is for.  <br><br>To me it seems AutoFocus is intended for everything on the task level or ground level.  It is not intended to replace project management per se.  (A question I raised in another post is exactly about how these two could possibly go together.)<br><br>But then, I *can* throw anything at it, even projects.  So what now?  I can see how it would work for projects that have indefinitely to develop, but how would it work for projects that have mission-critical dealines?  But I am getting into the topic of the other thread now.<br><br>So what is the basic purpose and goal of AutoFocus?  What is it supposed to do and what not?  (And yes, I have read the instructions several times, and I am using AF, and I have been reading quite a few of the discussion here on this forum.  Still might have missed something.)<br><br>Joshua</div>

<div class="content">Hi Joshua<br><br>Mark gave the following response within a thread a couple of days ago ......<br><br>"The aim of AF is not to impose a whole lot of "shoulds" on you, but to give you enough of a framework to do the work you want to do without being distracted and let astray. To do that, it restricts the choice you have at any one moment."<br><br>You might also find the blog entries Mark made before releasing AF for Beta Testing helpful.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Joshua:<br><br>I think the confusion you feel about AF's purpose is because you are not making a distinction between managing a project (which may involve coordinating the activities of hundreds of people) and managing yourself within a project (which involves the activities of one person - yourself).<br><br>If you buy a book about project management it will have completely different subject matter from a book about time management.</div>

<div class="content">Christine,<br><br>Thank you for that quote!<br><br>Mark,<br><br>You are most probably right.  So how would I go about resolving my confusion?  Any suggestions?<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Joshua:<br><br>To manage a project will require documentation commensurate with the size of the project. So for instance I'm co-ordinatiing an Arts Festival at the moment. I have a file for it, which contains minutes of meetings, agendas, records of conversations, and lists of actions with due dates and who is responsible for them. I also have an email folder for it. That's all project planning.<br><br>Out of that documentation I can extract action needed by me. Things like "Check dates people are available"; "Source display boards", "Write minutes", "Arrange meeting with T", etc. Another important task is the recurring one "Review action needed for Arts Festival".<br><br>Most of my projects though I simply keep in my head, with documentation where necessary.  A useful recurring task is "Thinking session".<br></div>
