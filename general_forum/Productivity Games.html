<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">We've been talking about using games to enhance productivity and the possibility of a video game application to help people get things done under the Mark, Are You There? thread. Thought it would be a good idea to change the thread name so more people can chime in. <br><br>Along this line, I've been reading The Best Tennis of Your Life. It's a short, sweet book that can really be applied to anything. It's about addressing the mental side of the game, especially overcoming fear. I love the concepts of being grateful, always seeking to learn something new about yourself or the game, and to just give it all you've got without thinking about the ramifications of that. I plan to put the advice into practice throughout the day today. What kinds of thinking sabotage your productivity game plan?</div>

<div class="content">How about Dave Seah's goals tracker? <br><a href="http://davidseah.com/blog/comments/concrete-goals-tracker-updates/" rel="nofollow">http://davidseah.com/blog/comments/concrete-goals-tracker-updates/</a><br><br>You assign 1, 2, 5 or 10 points to tasks according to how important they are to you and then you keep a tally of how many of each you accomplish during the day. Points as a measure of productivity if you wish and you could easily get hooked on trying to improve yesterday's score...</div>

<div class="content">For tracking a few things, this could be helpful:<br><br><a href="http://www.joesgoals.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.joesgoals.com/</a><br><br>I always like Life Balance's pie chart. Too bad that development went stale, the forum became over-policed, their pricing model became dated, otherwise I might use it. <br><br>Playing with it was a great way to avoid do other stuff while feeling productive.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the link, Kjell. Sometime after Christmas, I may give it a try. Norman, don't you find the data entry with LB overwhelming? In order for it to truly give you an accurate pie chart, you should put absolutely everything into it. My perfectionism kept that going for awhile, but long-term, it's ridiculous imo.</div>

<div class="content">I enjoyed LifeBalance back when I had a Palm.  The pie chart I found is cute but it's not accurate.  You just have to accept that and move on.  If the chart is too off-balance, you can fiddle with some numbers to make it reasonable.  The main cool thing about it is it automatically suggests stuff to work on based on what you haven't been working on.  Kind of like AF in that respect, but it does its thing by category instead of being linear.</div>

<div class="content">Mel,<br><br>Yeah, that was my poorly implied point. I often used LB as a modeling tool to see how my life might be if I did different activities. I kid you not. I would check off a few things, look at the chart, then uncheck them and select others and see how balanced I was after "doing" those tasks.<br><br>I got pretty good at using LB. I had a really well-balanced pie, my life on the other hand . . .  <br><br>I suggested to llamagraphics they rename the app Pie Balance, but I don't think they were thrilled with the idea.</div>

<div class="content">Alan, that was the thing about LB I liked the most. It would say, "Spend time with dh" when I really wanted to be doing all kinds of less important tasks. Unfortunately, the overhead required to get it to do that was too much for me.<br><br>Norman, that's funny you ran potential scenarios using LB. I liked the pie chart, too, but the biggest problem I had with it was the same one I developed with AF. I don't do well having a massive list of to-do's hanging over my head. I relish the feeling of having a good chunk of time when there's nothing I feel I have to do. Using any of the TM approaches, I could turn even really enjoyable activities into obligations I resisted. I think it's possible that I could change my thinking and return to AF, but if not using a list is working for me, I wonder why I should?</div>

<div class="content">Mel:<br><br><< I relish the feeling of having a good chunk of time when there's nothing I feel I have to do. >><br><br>So you didn't have "Do nothing" as a task on your AF list?</div>

<div class="meta">2009-12-20 20:16</div>
<div class="content">No, Mark, but I'm not sure that would have helped. I certainly could have tried, "Don't worry about the 32 pages of tasks you have." LOL</div>

<div class="content">Mark, I just had another realization with respect to AF for me. You know how you asked me about how things worked BEFORE AF? I knew what you were driving at. IOW, was my life chaotic and so that's why I needed a list? The answer is no. My life has never been perfect, but I do focus on the important things and get them done and was doing so even pre-AF. My problem was what I did was never good enough for me. AF and your forum have enabled me to determine that I was trying to fix what wasn't broken. Who knows how long it would have taken me to figure that out elsewhere? Thanks again.</div>

<div class="content">Mel:<br><br>I don't think I asked you about "before AF" so much as "before your own attempts to get organised" because I think you were blogging on the subject long before I developed AF. So I was interested to know what is different about then and now.<br><br>If I understand you correctly, your answer seems to be basically that you are more accepting of what you do and don't do. Would that be a fair summary?</div>

<div class="content">Mark, it's a fair summary. Years ago I would have benefited greatly from any kind of time management approach. My life was truly chaotic! But things have been good for a number of years now. I just never quit beating myself up about what I didn't get done. Meanwhile my friends are in awe of what I accomplish. I was thinking though that if I ever pursue a career outside of my home, I may need to return to AF. How good it is to have that option!</div>

<div class="content">Another distinction maybe whether one accepts an external agenda (the employer, the family, God, emulating those Jones's) or an agenda from within (exercise regimen, writing the novel that's always wanted to emerge) - for the latter a list may matter more.</div>

<div class="content">New game: the balanced diet game.  Following the Canadian Food Guide, I should each day eat 10 servings fruits and veggies, 8 grains, 2 milk and alternatives, and 3 meat and alternatives.<br><br>So starting with 4 colors of poker chips, I can drop them into the pot when I eat one of those groups.  No points for cake.  No points for exceeding the guide recommendations in any category.<br><br>Aim to maximize your weekly score.</div>

<div class="content">Good idea on the "poker chip diet" Alan!  Especially for kids.<br><br>Here's a variation - to use money - pennies, nickels, dimes and quarters for the food groups.  For every "bad food" you eat, throw in a toonie and at the end of the week, donate the toonies to a worthy cause.  Preferably one related to the food bank or something.</div>
