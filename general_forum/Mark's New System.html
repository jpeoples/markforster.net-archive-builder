<div class="content">I know, I know, Mark hasn't released his new system yet. And to be quite fair, let me remind everybody that there are no commitments whatsoever that ties him to finish creating or polishing it.<br><br>But just out of curiosity (and this is a direct question to you Mark) could you give some news about it. I was watching the Autofocus video just now and I must say, I never seen a more streamed lined system... ever. I want to know what's happening in that mind of yours :)</div>

<div class="content">You know, whatever it might be, I doubt I'd follow it unless it serves a radically different purpose. I'm much too happy with how my current system is functioning, especially at home.</div>

<div class="content">I didn't know there was a new system. I would be curious to see and test it. I wonder if it will be near AF or DWM. However AF4 works perfectly for the moment. So I will follow it that way as long as I feel it.<br><br>But I am always very interested by what MF does. He's so creative.  I even took some tips from DIT. So I think that May be I shall find some tips to improve my system again which becomes at last very efficient, for the moment...</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the interest, everyone. Unfortunately my original idea for a new system didn't work out and my attempts at improving it haven't worked out either. So the situation at the moment is that there is no new system in the pipeline. That doesn't mean there never will be, though!</div>

<div class="content">That begs the question of which one Mark is now on ... AF4, DWM or both. ;-}</div>

<div class="content">@sabre23t<br><br>If I where to guess, I'd say a "half AF1" system but anyone's guess is as good as mine :)</div>
