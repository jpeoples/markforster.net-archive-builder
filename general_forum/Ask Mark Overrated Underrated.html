<div class="content">This post was part humor, part learning, so it seems "mission accomplished". Ha. That's why I started with meetings — I already knew your answer for that!</div>

<div class="content">My name's not Mark, but I'll give it a go!<br>*overrated: doing tons of things to "be productive".<br>*underrated: having a clear view of things so the few that are done are truly productive!</div>

<div class="content">Expensive proprietary systems with notebooks, inserts, special calendar, special paper, quarterly updates, rules, hole punch, tabs, stickers, markers, 4 color pens, page markers ...<br><br>vs<br><br>piece of paper and a pencil</div>

<div class="content">matthewS:<br><br>"Expensive proprietary systems."<br><br>Overrated. Though our digital devices have essentially become the modern equivalent!<br><br><br>"Paper and pen."<br><br>Vastly underrated. Especially when compared to apps and digital devices.</div>

<div class="content">I'm a paper and pen man myself as you all know, though for most systems the paper is best in a simple notebook. <br><br>The only exception to this is The Last Hour for which I use a simple to do list on Evernote. The reason for this is that I can easily change the order of the tasks as circumstances change. (It would be too messy to do this with paper and pen (or even pencil)</div>
