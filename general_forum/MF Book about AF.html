<div class="content">Hi Mark, I am still working with AF - 6 month with it incredible !<br><br>At the very beginning i thought that it was just a to do list and nothing more. I must admit that the system works and it does much better for me than GTD did with action. What i love above everything is the astonishing feeling of being scotched to the reality and the pleasure of using the system. GTD was hard to use on the flow, AF is easy for me if i only put actionables tasks on it. <br><br>Also, this forum is indeed interesting lot of people brings ideas, improovement and try to do their best to follow the rules about the AF (1,2,3,4).<br><br>So, I wonder if you intend to make a book about it as you did with DIT (bytheway, i have ordered yesterday on amazon because i still not red it, unfortunatly). <br><br>This may be a good idea and if you could add some pages about the following of yours projects and the way you follow yours agreements, sure it would be helfull for us. <br><br>Will you ?</div>

<div class="content">After trying all AF i definitly shose and use AF4. Except that during the day when i have to focus on urgent tasks, (and by exception of DIT ;)) ),  i use reversed AF. When the storm is gone,  i go back to AF4. I notice that when some tasks are not done on my backlog, and still remains over 2 days it means i dont want or don't need to do them. So they are dissmissed or reformulated until they are cross. <br><br>I must admit too that i only use AF4 for active tasks all which is not active (wait, future tasks ...)  goes either on my tickler, either on my diary( if there is none alternative) or on a gtd list such a someday may be list, waiting list or context<br><br>I also have 2 AF4 lists one is Home lists the other is work (even if i still work at home) it helps me to focus on my tasks. <br><br>For the time beeing i like having them on taskpaper but i appreciate having it on paper when things becomes really hot even if i have to rewrite them and reformulating them. Doing this exercice takes me some short time but it helps me so much to clarify things.</div>
