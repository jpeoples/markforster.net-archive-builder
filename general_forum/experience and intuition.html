<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-03-7 10:26</div>
<div class="content">A NYT article about intuition got me thinking about AF. The article was about Airport Security and what they do besides undressing people in front of metal detectors:<br><br>>>A well-trained eye and ear — emphasis on the well-trained — can pick up signals a metal detector cannot.<br><br>“We started off thinking, What is it we do better than anybody else? What’s the advantage we have? And it’s that we see two million people every day. We know what normal is,” Mr. Hawley said. A good behavioral detection officer has developed the skills to separate normal airport anxieties from fundamental signs of “hostile intent,” he said.<<<br><br><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/21/business/21road.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/21/business/21road.html</a><br><br>In AF, the recommendation is to "trust my subconscious" and read a page until one item "stands out". Very well. But my first weeks with the system were not pleasant: I always had the suspicion that I was completing the wrong tasks, even if my subconscius was obviously pleased. <br><br>At some point, the cat was obsessively groomed, the floor looked shiny and I had answered every conceivable email, re-conected with long lost friends and repaired the copy machine at the office until I dropped all the lists, finished that ugly work project I had been avoiding, and re-started my AF system with a few changes: I separated work and private tasks (left page private, right pages work) I had a separate project list on my computer, and I reminded myself in AF to look at it from time to time.<br><br>In this "planning mode", I also created more granular plans of the bigger projects, entered deadlines into the calendar, thought about priorities and "milestones". then, I entered a few items in the AF lists and updated the status of a few projects.<br><br>We tend to think that intuition is always natural, that the "gut instinct" knows best. Unfortunately, not in every case: The intuition of a child to run across the street, the risky behaviour of a stock market trader. <br><br>This time I had a different experience with AF: Somehow my mind was much more willing to let goal-related items "stand out". This was not only a matter of motivation.<br><br>To trust the subconscios maybe is not the end of the story. The ability to autofocus might need training and experience as every other activity that relies on intuition. <br><br>The instructions for AF are straightforward and helpful. But for people with complex commitments, regularly thinking about the bigger picture of their work might be an integral part of the system, to develop a more educated intuition, so to say.</div>

<div class="content">to rephrase the post as a suggestion: so many people in this forum use some sort of project list, even mindmaps to keep track of their commitments. If this would be mentioned in the instructions, a lot of frustration at the beginning could be avoided.</div>

<div class="content">I take your point, and I have always been a planner.  But it is also true that no system must accomplish everything.  I'm quite happy that AF ignores planning.  I really love that it has no advice on how to file things, or what kind of folders to use or to use a label machine.  It also is silent on diet and exercise and I've yet to see any relationship advice in the rules ;-)<br><br>For some reason people seem to need to be told everything.  I'm not sure why the idea of taking bits that work from where you find them is elusive ;-)<br><br>If I were to join your suggestion it would only be to suggest that the instructions make clear that this is ONLY a task management tool and not mentioning everything else simply means that you have to go elsewhere to get information on those.</div>

<div class="content">M_N:<br><br>You mean the instructions should include something like:"DO include plenty of creative tasks such as Think about, Investigate; Discuss; Review"?<br><br>To be quite clear, AF is not intended to rely on intuition only. It is intended to balance the intuitive and rational minds.<br><br>Your experience starting AF was interesting. To someone reading what you say like myself, it stands out that most of your difficulties came from "that ugly work project I had been avoiding".<br><br>I don't know enough about what actually happened, but if you were working strictly according to the AF instructions, there should have come a point where you either had to do the work project (or at least start on it) or dismiss it. If you dismissed it, then that should have been the time to work out why you were avoiding it and what you could do about it.<br><br>In the event, what appears to have happened is that AF actually caused a crisis in your mind about the project, which resulted in your doing it anyway. Was this the triumph of rationality over intuition or the other way round, if every part of you was screaming "I must do that project"?<br><br>In fact my experience, and that of other people on this forum, is that following the AF process is an education in itself.</div>

<div class="content">When Mark says "In fact my experience, and that of other people on this forum, is that following the AF process is an education in itself. " that is SO true.  And it carries on - it's not a case that you wake up one morning and think "I know everything there is to know about AutoFocus, what it does, how it works in every scenario, what systems it works best with, what colour pen to use, etc etc etc"  In fact the moment you think you know what is going to happen next ..... it doesn't.  The more I test the system, and try other things around it, the more it surprises me.<br><br>Some days it is easier to trust the system than others.  Some days I get in a flap about something or other that I really "ought" to do.  Somedays I will think - "aha, if I do this and put stuff into AF this way, I will get those flappy things done within the system" Piffle!  What normally happens is that I get more and more frustrated - resent the things that I am doing even though they are on my list - and the only cure for this very sad state of affairs is to go back to "what stands out", and what stands out genuinely rather than because I have tried to force it to do so by telling my subconscious that it has big neon flashing lights around it.<br><br>As was posted elsewhere, it's getting back to the items standing out being FUN!<br><br>When I took on my first employee I stressed that one of the rules of the company was that we must have fun.  We worked hard, we planned hard, we got stressed, we had successes and we had failures.  But we also had fun.  Then one day she came to me and said, "Chris, I'm not having fun anymore"  That was quite a defining moment - a moment that required a complete rethink, not so much on what we were doing, but on how we were doing it.<br><br>So how does that compare with AF?  AF is not just a system for getting things done and definitely not just "a To Do list" :-)  It is, as Mark says, a system to balance the rational and the intuitive.  It is a system that provides Focus.  It is a system that enables us to do what is important for us.  THAT is where the confusion often lies ...... our intuition knows what is important to us - but that may be very different to what we, or others, have told us is important, and it is then that there can be a real battle.  If our deep seated desire is to go and raise sheep on a Scottish island and we are currently working in a high tech City industry, we will never be comfortable with AF because it will not let us forget what is really important.  If we are determined to stick with the high tech job at any cost (and I mean at any cost as opposed to a means towards the island croft) then only a structured system, a system to do, will work.<br><br>Sure we can use AF to do, but that waters down it's full impact to the extent that it will start to behave like a To Do list and it's real benefits will just evaporate.  To repeat what Mark says, "following the AF process is an education in itself"<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>of course the ugly project had to be done (or dismissed) simply because it was on the list, page 1. If one sticks to the rules, the repetition does the trick, and the suggestion to include lots of creative tasks is already helpful.<br><br>In my case, my list kept growing, I was at page 2 and I felt overwhelmed in the first week. I had read the suggestion to "review" but had no idea what that meant and how important it was. I took it as a suggestion to "be creative" and to include more open ended tasks.<br><br><br>I easily forget deadlines, and during that particular week I had a lot of trouble to decide or even remember which project was the urgent one at the moment. I got lots of things done, but felt overwhelmed, with these endless growing lists. <br><br>Maybe it was just the wrong time to change my system, and I did not want to criticise the system as the response so far indicates.<br><br>If there are two tasks left, A and B, and by choosing A one finds out the next day that B would have been better, looking at project lists from time to time helps me a lot in my daily AF decisions.<br><br>Of course this is already suggested - but after searching for "project" in the forum I was amazed how many people in this group found it necessary, at one point or another, to regularly think about the bigger picture. Not in AF, of course, but isn't frequency of the question interesting?</div>

<div class="content">Thanks M_N *SO* much for starting this discussion and for everyone who has contributed to this thread! I have been struggling lately and wondering if I should "start AF over again." I have been feeling very disappointed in my progress lately re one of my projects (the backlog part of it) and started thinking I needed just to "timeblock" it and use the "brute force" method.  (With AF, I have made small amounts of progress, but too small for me to be satisfied with, now that it is March and AF beta started at the beginning of January!) At the same time, I wonder if my judgement on this is off, and that the progress I HAVE made is actually NOT bad or wrong or inadequate, even, and if AF wasn't working rather well on this aversive project! It is not a project I really want to do, but is rather a significant legal and moral obligation sort of project (not something I chose to do and the legalities involved preclude my ditching it without negative consequences I don't really want). Previous attempts to delegate some of the related tasks have met with *horrific* results, necessitating in significant amounts of time and money needed to correct the problems which resulted! So I am reluctant to try THAT approach again! Perhaps AF is just reflecting my own "ambivalencies" / aversion (but I knew that before starting AF.) <br><br>Anyway, I continue to struggle along with this issue and appreciate this related discussion!</div>

<div class="content">Bev<br><br>I understand what you mean about that type of project and think the fact is that there are some things that just *have* to be done.  I have a lot of pre AF obligations that I am struggling with and like you ditching them is not an option.  I am finding AF makes them easier to handle but they will not go away until they are done - and cannot be dismissed for the simple reason that we have made a conscious decision that we will do them regardless.  Where I do think AF is the biggest help in these instances is in (a) enabling us to see the issue more clearly and giving us the additional insight to avoid allowing these things into our lives in the future and (b) giving us space to look at more creative solutions.  Sometimes there is no solution - it just has to be done, by us, and in a particular way.  In that scenario just interspersing it with the benefits of AF as seen in the remaining items on our lists may have to be enough until we finally get to the point of clearing it.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks so much, Christine! I very much appreciate your take on this issue. I am valiantly trying now to stay on top of this project while "coralling" the backlog. I really have been thinking about revamping my AF and taking project tasks off of it, but perhaps the "interspersing" as you say, is actually working fine; and just adding separate, more detailed project lists to supplement my basic AF list would be a better solution. I guess more testing is in order!! THANKS so much for understanding "that type of project" !! :o)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Bev,<br><br>If you look at my previous posts, you will see that I too struggled with multiple projects and trying to make AF work.  I do maintain separate project plans and create timelines.  However, I use AF now completely as my main system.  You want to know what has finally made such a complete difference to me?  I let go of my 100% digital system and now use a simple spiral-bound notebook.  That is correct -- going to a paper notebook has made AF so much better for me!  The lack of overhead of a digital system has been wonderful.  I still maintain my entire calendar in Outlook 2007.<br><br>I never thought doing something so simple as AF in a paper notebook would make such a difference -- but it has.  And I am a reasonably busy fellow....smiles.<br><br>Best wishes,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Hi David<br><br>Just wanted to take the opportunity to say how pleased I am that AF is now working so well for you.  Isn't it strange the difference paper AF makes?  I love digital solutions but AF needs paper!  It makes me realise why the paperless office will never work - we "need" paper, even if just to doodle on!</div>

<div class="content">Bev:<br><br>I think when you have a big project which you really don't want to do, especially one which has built up a load of resistance before you even started on AF, then you do have to hit it with brute force. Once you've got it out of the way then the system should prove much easier.<br><br>I would suggest you block out a definite time for it each day and work on it in timed bursts. if you do that, I think you will make faster progress on it, and will also find your AF list works better without that project on it.</div>
