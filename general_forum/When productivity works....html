<div class="content">Will:<br><br>B. Sher's Wishcraft is one of the rare self-help books I recommend to clients. But note, the exercises are best done - as she suggests - in group (she calls these "success teams") or with a partner.</div>

<div class="content">Update:<br><br>Went on a small book tour (Western Canada), and spoke at the Vancouver Jewish Book Fair. After my talk, I stood around like a shnook waiting for somebody to ask me to sign their book.  (Wait, did anyone even purchase my book!?). One minute... four minutes... nothing. My friend - who attended the talk - felt bad for me, and suggested lunch ("You'll feel better after eating something"). Alas, a lovely woman approached and asked me to sign her copy of Learning to Commit. And then another, and another.  According to the event organizer, my book sold out in 20 minutes (granted, my publisher didn't send a ton of books, but still...). <br><br>So that's that, it's nice to share good (productive) news with Forster fans. <br><br>Video (of the talk) and transcript can be found here: <a href="http://www.learningtocommit.com/blog/a-literary-quickie" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.learningtocommit.com/blog/a-literary-quickie</a></div>
