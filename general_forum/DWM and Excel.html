<div class="content">Can someone explain to me how they set-up EXCEL for their DWM lists?  I gather that several people are using EXCEL for DWM and finding it works well.</div>

<div class="content">I am very happy with my excel set up. You really only need two columns, "expiry date" and "task." And then you can sort by expiry date. <br><br>I use macros that put in two types of dates, today+30 and today +7 and have them copy and paste special so they do not update. I added other columns including days left (=Expiry-today) columns, columns for time started and ended and a link column to link to needed urls and files.<br><br>In order to get the flipping through effect, I filter by days left to see only tasks that expire today, tomorrow, et. al<br><br>Hope this is useful, I find DWM excellent on Excel.</div>

<div class="content">Mine's a simple 4-column setup - Column A has today's date, column B has either N (new) or C (continue), Column C is a formula for the 'expire date' - if column B is N, then do today+30, if it's C, do today+7, and Column D has the task description. <br><br>I also put in conditional formatting to change column D to purple if  expire date = today. I haven't had anything turn purple yet :)</div>
