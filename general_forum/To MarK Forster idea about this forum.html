<div class="content">Hi Mark, I regularly read AF forum and find very interesting it is so amazing how people caught your methode and deal with it. <br><br>I just find quiet un easy to find tips and questions about things i have to read many trhread until i find the answer. <br><br>Dont you think it would be interesting having a summery of all thread and make a possibility even else where on a data base to find answer to our questions ?<br><br>What do you think about it ? May be the others have ideas about that ? <br><br>Best regards</div>

<div class="content">The only problem with the FAQ's is that they're buried. If they were a sticky they'd stand out.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for reminding me - I had intended to put a permanent link in for the FAQs, but somehow it fell off my list. It's now re-instated!</div>

<div class="content">Mark<br><br>Because I have suggested this long ago, and you added so many things in the left column, I thought you have dismissed this idea!!! <br>So, I decided not to mention it again. I am a big fan of this FAQ  that Christine has prepared and I myself would use it more if I don`t have to look for it.</div>
