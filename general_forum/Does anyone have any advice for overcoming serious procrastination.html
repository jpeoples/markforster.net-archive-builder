<div class="content">Hi everyone,<br><br>I am having a serious procrastination problem at the moment...<br><br>The more work I have to do, the more I try to avoid it, I just think '...i'll do that another day' but 'another day' never seems to come.<br><br>I have deadlines approaching quicker than I want them to yet what I don't want is a mad rush at the last minute...<br><br>It seems actually the more I procrastinate the more tired I get... which seems quite strange to me.<br><br>I wondered if anyone can offer any advice to a serious procrastinator?</div>

<div class="content">It is a tough habit to break, but I think it is a habit, just like efficiently working is a habit.  The problem for some is the one you mention overwhelm. Others may be addicted to the adrenalin of the last minute rush.<br><br>I wrote about procrastination at one point you may find the article on my blog.  But, one technique I have taught some people is to use short daily lists.  This removes the overwhelm of looking at huge lists which can be a roadblock to some.  This builds the completion muscles as I call it and proves you can get things finished.  This technique works for lots of no-project things to do.  It is basically DIT, using a closed daily list and the little and often principal to reduce a backlog<br><br>For projects, the other technique I have used which goes against some time management principals is to get calendar and schedule out in small chunks projects you must complete.  Try to schedule them in a way that they are done a few days to a week in advance of the deadline.  This margin of safety can be comforting.  By showing yourself there is time to get the project done and no one chunk is too big, can again be a sign of relief and get people on the right track.<br><br>Good luck<br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div>

<div class="content">I have found Procrastinators Anonymous (PA) to be invaluable.  There are 15 minute morning phone bridge meetings at 7:30 am and 8:30am EST.  Each day at those meetings, there is an opportunity for sharing, making action commitments, & "bookkending" check-in meetings are scheduled on the half-hour at requested times during the day.  The support and accountability are great, as are the 12-step tools & promises.  Google procrastinators anonymous for the website which offers on-line check-ins, chatbox, and online meeting, as well as phone bridge meeting info. Over 20 years, I read many books re: procrastination, tried many methods, and worked with three therapists.  PA is the only thing that really helped me.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Simon, <br><br>sorry to hear you are struggling. If things are getting desperately bad my initial response is to try the 'not insane to do list' (available on the American Digest website). <br><br>Basically you choose your 3 most important tasks for the day and work on them before thinking about doing other tasks. Undone items roll over into one of the 3 slots for the next day. <br><br>My personal view with procrastination is the simpler the better and the shorter the to do list the better.<br><br>Good luck!</div>

<div class="content">An after thought Simon,<br><br>I have seen somewhere the idea of the 'have done' list where one basically writes down what they 'have done'. This is in order to acknowledge work done and progress made. This can often go unnoticed.<br><br>How about:<br><br>today's date<br><br>(not insane to do list items)<br><br>1<br>2<br>3<br>---------------------------------------<br><br>('have done list - under the line)<br><br>I might try it myself!</div>

<div class="content">Try to solve the underlying problem.<br><br>I currently procrastinate on a task that would be fun, but I don't have the time to do it well enough to be satisfied myself (I know that less would be good enough) - and being a commitment where others are involved gives it far more priority it would get otherwise. In this case, the reasons boil down to overcommitment and perfectionism. So I promised myself that I will avoid the same overcommitment next year (it's an annual opportunity for overcommitment ;-) ) and that I'll just do the minimum and refine if there's some time left.<br><br>You mention being tired. Because of doing too much or because you don't feel well? Maybe this points to another reason for procrastination (been there, done that, avoided getting the t-shirt).<br><br>Good luck!</div>

<div class="content">Keep the suggestions coming !  I'm thinking two keys are good: start small, and it gets easier once you've started. Second ponder (in detached observational style) what is your reason for acting and what for postponement. Get clear in your mind how realistic those motives are, rebalance your thinking, and then go back to my first point and take action. <br><br>At least that's what I'm going to try now.</div>

<div class="content">Hear, hear Alan, keep those suggestions and ideas coming!<br><br>It's always good for someone to start a thread like this, reminds some of us (all right, me!) that we have strayed like lost sheep.<br><br>For a big task which HAS to be done: try the Salami techniigue and build up a series of initially small steps into a real flow.<br><br>However, as other have said, also celebrate the small stuff as well.  I realised I had slipped back by not clearing my Inbox every evening - 'clearing' does not necessarily mean EVERY email has been deailt with in full, if at all - but a an empty Inbox first thing in the morning is fare more encouraging than seeing stray sheep from the day before.<br><br>Having just emptied my Inbox, I'll log off and shut down, anything else that would have come in during the last few minutes can bloody well wait.  If it's REALLY urgent, a line in my email signature tells folk what to do.</div>

<div class="content">It is best to discover WHY you are procrastinating before you simply apply the most popular technique you come across.  Most techniques you'll hear about apply to procrastination caused by a feeling of overwhelm.  If that is not your case, then techniques addressing that issue will not help much.<br><br>My suggestion is that you do some serious introspection to discover why you are procrastinating and then choose a technique accordingly.<br><br>Good Luck.</div>

<div class="content">My name is Beth L and I am a procrastinator...<br>Yes it is a tough one to conquer. In my search for help with this, I have come up with a few things. Certainly discovering the underlying issues is a must if it persists. Yet sometimes a simpler answer can work in the moment.<br><br>One thing that works for me is to take 30-60 minutes and clean off my desk. Having a clean work space is critical for me and is well worth the time it takes. Then make a simple list of whatever must be done NEXT. <br><br>I have also gathered some quotes to inspire me along the way:<br><br>~Procrastination is putting off what you want most for what you want now. [unknown]<br><br>~To go far you must begin near, and the nearest step is the most important one. [Krishnamurti]<br><br>~The shortest answer is doing.

<div class="content">Mike: Not sure if I'm in a majority here but I think telling a procrastinator to 'do some serious introspection' is going to be a bit counterproductive. Basically that's just more procrastination, right?</div>

<div class="meta">2010-05-18 22:20</div>
<div class="content">Hi Ed. Being a self-professed procrastinator (see above) I will say that I have spent a lot of time in introspection on the issue, as well as many others. So for me, they don't seem to be directly related, and that may just be the way I am wired.<br><br>Deep introspection is something that draws me in naturally and easily. I think one thing that is true about "procrastinators" is that only SOME things sit there while others do in fact get done effortlessly. I would say that no one that knows me would say I am lazy...quite the contrary. I do a lot in any given day. I just don't always do things I often "should".<br><br>Not sure if others who procrastinate relate to this, but it is true for me. Hence, spending time looking at why some things get done and others do not is a great thing to reflect on and has been fruitful without a doubt. I do think procrastination is an issue that I must "stay on top of", giving it sometimes continual attention.</div>

<div class="content">One more thought on this...and yes, one can get caught up in the looking at and not the doing. <br><br>It is a balancing act...one that requires maturity and intention to get real, meaningful movement on in the long one.<br><br>And indeed in the short term when things just must get done, I find that doing now and reflecting later is the only way. Hence, why I love that quote: The shortest answer is doing.</div>

<div class="content">Looking for answers can be procrastination if one uses it for that purpose.  The thing is that using the wrong technique can eat up a lot more time, energy and attitude.  I reiterate, using a technique to deal with overwhelm when you are not procrastinating because you feel overwhelmed, is worse than useless.</div>

<div class="content">Sometimes, I get so frustrated and angry with myself for procrastinating on important stuff. At these times I find the best answer is to just completely get away from it for an hour or two, or even a day or two. I do what I WANT to do instead -- go for a walk, watch a movie, read a book, surf the internet, play a game. When I am ready, I will get back to work. And it is truly amazing what I can achieve in a very short time just before an important deadline :)</div>

<div class="content">Hi All. De-lurking to post three thoughts, as a chronic procrastinator:<br><br>1) Recovering Procrastinator said: 'I have found Procrastinators Anonymous (PA) to be invaluable.'<br><br>Absolutely. PA is wonderful. <br><br>The PA website and network takes procrastination extremely seriously. It starts from the idea that procrastination is not a small problem. Procrastination has cost people their job, their career, their marriage, their home etc etc.<br> <br> Some of the articles on the PA site are very thought-provoking. My own first steps back from procrastination came from reading articles on the PA site. From them I realised that procrastination was not funny or quirky or in any way cool. It’s deadly. <br><br>A key insight for me from the site was the idea of 'demand resistance', where I resist doing things for no better reason that than somebody has asked me to. <br><br>I realised this idea explains why I preferred freelance work to salaried work. As a freelancer, I'm doing a piece of work because I'm working with my client and helping them and it's my idea to do what I'm doing; as an employee I may be doing exactly the same piece of work, but I'm doing it because my boss told me to.  I see that as a demand, and I resist.<br><br>2) And I loved the anonymous quote Beth L gave, that is ‘It is easy to dodge our responsibilities, but we cannot dodge the consequences of dodging our responsibilities’.<br><br>There’s a big truth in there. I’m sure a lot of my procrastination is down to an unhelpful ability to separate actions – or rather, the failure to act - from their consequences. A question to the psychologists out there: is this an example of cognitive dissonance?<br><br>3) Another related idea that works for me came from the classic children’s book ‘We’re All Going On A Bear Hunt’. A recurring them in the book is that some things just can’t be avoided. You have to do them, because if you don't, the bear will get you. So I can break thru procrastination if I can get myself to just sigh, accept the inevitable, and apply the ‘bear-hunt’ principle: ‘I can’t go over it, I can’t go under it, I’ll just have to go through it’.<br><br>Good luck Simon H. Procrastination is a horrible thing to suffer from.</div>

<div class="content">Don, <br><br>You made two very interesting and valuable points:<br><br>- Demand resistance is a very common cause that has nothing AT ALL to do with overwhelm and so the standard advice won't help AT ALL with it.  I.E. if the reason you are not doing it is that you are rebelling against authority then chunking the task down is not going to help.<br><br>- Consequences.  One very important factor is the inability to, not so much see the consequences of our actions as to make them REAL to ourselves.  That kind of disconnectedness in time from consequences also plays a big part in addictive behavior.  Addicts seldom connect what happened the LAST time they got drunk, or high, or whatever with taking that next drink, or hit or whatever.  Each experience is fresh and new (no matter how many times they have repeated it) and so they never "learn".  Procrastinators are much the same.  It never occurs to us what happened LAST YEAR when we put off doing the taxes until the night before they were due.  There is a big difference between saying "I'd better get started on this or I'll be in trouble." and FEELING what you FELT the last time you got into trouble.<br><br>One thing you probably got from that website (and I got from reading some very serious books on the subject) was finding your particular mental orientation.  Which is why I have been advising people to find out the REASON before taking the medicine.  You don't take Aunt Millie's heart pills just because they made HER feel better ... they are not going to do a thing for your broken leg.  You go to the doctor who determines what is wrong with YOU before he prescribes something -- a cast not heart medicine.</div>

<div class="meta">2010-05-19 12:55</div>
<div class="content">Mike, <br><br>It really struck a chord with me where you say “… the inability to, not so much see the consequences of our actions as to make them REAL to ourselves. That kind of disconnectedness in time from consequences also plays a big part in addictive behavior… Each experience is fresh and new (no matter how many times they have repeated it) and so they never "learn". Procrastinators are much the same. “<br><br>This helps explain for me a hitherto baffling aspect of repeated procrastination: namely, I’m not stupid, and I know what happened last time, so how come it’s happened again? I haven’t caught my leg in a car door since I was five years old. It hurt too much. But individual instances of procrastination have hurt my life much, much more- and I keep doing it. <br><br>So, dealing with procrastination is not a question of simple logic or memory or reason or tips and tricks. It’s an entirely different question altogether.<br><br>This is where, as you say, Simon H needs to find out the reason for his procrastination.</div>
<h2>Reply by Don</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-05-19 13:11</div>
<div class="content">Hi Simon H, <br><br>Two thoughts:<br><br>1) I’m sure you know many tips and techniques for dealing with procrastination. But you can, right now, also write down the likely results of your current procrastination. So dealing with your procrastination is not a matter of learning more techniques; it’s something else. <br><br>As Mike says, procrastination seems to be akin to addiction. <br><br>A number of things follow from this, which I am in no way qualified to talk about. But I know from personal experience that once you start thinking of procrastination as being like an addiction, your thoughts about it can change. <br><br>For me, I accepted that a tendency to procrastinate was natural for me; that it would be a constant daily fight to keep procrastination at bay; that no amount of intellectualising would make any difference; that it had the potential to damage my life very seriously; and that I would have to humbly listen to people who had in any sense beaten it. <br><br>It also helped me understand why I couldn’t apply the knowledge I had of anti-procrastination tips and techniques. <br><br>It’s not easy to put into words, but to me it’s a bit like the idea that there’s no point giving a gambler tips and techniques like ‘avoid racetracks’, or ‘keep out of poker games’, until something else has happened first; and that ‘something’ is some kind of self-knowledge followed by some sort of decision which makes it possible – at last – to start applying the tips and techniques. <br><br>I have found it helpful to tell myself that I’m a procrastinator in the same way that a gambler is a gambler, or an alcoholic is an alcoholic. That is, it’s not how I define myself, but it is a part of who I am. <br><br>From this acknowledgement came something - a kind of humility/acceptance/falling away of scales from the eyes - which allows me to start to use the techniques to fight procrastination. Techniques which I’ve known for decades. The point I’m trying to make, rather badly, is that the techniques come second. Something else needs to come first.<br><br>Which leads me back to the PA website, which treats procrastination as an addiction. It also suggests procrastinators are susceptible to other addictive behaviours. I can’t comment on that, other than to say that for me it’s true.<br><br>If your procrastination is as bad as you suggest, can I humbly ask you to please think deeply and humbly about what procrastination really is, and the reason(s) why you procrastinate. That’s the key, and it’s not always easy to find. <br><br><br>2) Your tiredness: I think the internal conflict implicit in procrastination might explain your tiredness as well. <br><br>Somewhere in your rational mind, a voice is going ape at you the whole time, shouting ‘You should be working on X! You should be working in Y! You know what will happen if you don’t!’ <br><br>And somewhere else in your mind, the procrastinator in you is saying ‘Lalalala, whatever, let’s carry on with the displacement activity I’m doing right now’.  <br><br>So you carry on not working, knowing full well that you’re not doing what you should be doing, and knowing full well the painful consequences you’re risking. The internal conflict goes on, unceasingly, for as long as you procrastinate. <br><br>This is not a zen-like state of peacefulness and flow. It’s got to be pretty exhausting. I know it is for me.</div>

<div class="content">Pete,<br><br>Could you expand just a little on what you mean there?<br><br>Don,<br><br>I'm glad it stuck that chord.  The approach I recommend for this is to practice moving into the future.  Get into a relaxed "meditative" state and imagine your future if you take certain actions, or do not take them.  Try that future on, as it were.  Then see how it plays out in reality. Compare what you anticipated with the actual result and adjust your expectations.  Do it enough times as necessary to make your prediction accurate.  Obviously, do this for very short times into the future so you can do the comparison's easily.  As with all things, we get better with practice.  In any case, this is a good tool to have in your kit.</div>

<div class="content">Don and Mike, <br>I could not agree more with your posts.<br>People like me don't procrastinate because they want to, they do it because it's a learned reaction to a preceived unpleasant situation, whether imagined or real.<br>I began to win my battle with procrastination once I realised that not doing things was my imperfect answer to other deeper problems.<br>I found the book "Self-Discipline in 10 Days: How to Go from Thinking to Doing" by Theodore Bryant invaluable. It's a deceptively short book, some would say even childish in parts. All I can say is that something resonated with me and I found my attitude changing well before I finished the book. If you can get hold of a copy it's well worth it. Do the exercises too.<br>I hope you find a solution, Simon H. Let us know how you get on.</div>

<div class="content">Wooba's suggestion, taking an hour break to do something fun, is a very bad one for me.  That hour soon turns to 4 hours which then turns into "I'm too tired and it's too late", and that means another week passes with nothing achieved.</div>

<div class="content">*perceived* - sigh - untangles fingers from keyboard.<br><br>Also I can totally relate to the  "internal conflict" described by Don. It is exhausting and demoralising and a million miles away from the "lazing around" that we are accused of.</div>

<div class="meta">2010-05-19 14:24</div>
<div class="content">Mike<br><br>Thank you for your thoughts on practicing moving into the future. <br><br>It’s a really interesting idea: to meditatively and consciously place yourself in possible futures to see the effects of actions either taken or not taken, and to practice doing so enough to make the predictions accurate. A way of making consequences real before they arrive, before it’s too late to avoid them. I’ll go for that.<br><br>I suspect procrastination incorporates a desire and an ability to ignore the future. This is not a positive thing. Wilfully ignoring the future is not the same as living in the present. <br><br>My wife gets an enormous amount done, and can’t stand having undone jobs hanging over her. She totally does not understand procrastination. She simply can’t ignore the future. My ability and inclination to do so frustrates her enormously. Often I think she does too much, including things that don’t need doing, at the expense of enjoying the moment. She of course thinks I do the reverse.</div>

<div class="content">From the rate this thread has expanded vis-a-vis the staler threads that preceded it, procrastination almost seems to be the one thing that binds us forum folk.<br><br>But then if we were like Don's wife, we would not "need" the forum and all its thoughts, hints, tips, baring of souls etc.<br><br>Yes, I know one should explore the reasons for one's procrastination (and other behaviours?), but I've sometimes found that I've compounded the situation by trying to rationalise things - "until I understand why, i won't change or try to change!"  There's not a why for everything and everyone, sometimes things are just, things.<br><br>We all have our own demons (perceived or perceived to be real), whatever hints and crumbs of comfort we can derive, so much the better.<br><br>I for one have liked some of Don's late entries, especially 'demand resistance'.  We KNOW doing it will help, we just don't like being 'told' to do it.  Like the circumstance Don describes, I am also a rebel, or maverick (not the Palin kind, Mike!).<br><br>It explains why I am finally a freelancer, and that a psychometric test i did some 25 years ago tagged me has 'having a problem with some authority figures, especially when the authority is positional or referential eg "I'm the boss" and similar.<br><br>The consultant shrink's analysis stated that I could only accept an authority figure if I perceived that person to posses integrity and honesty.

<div class="content">Alan,<br><br>I understand your anxiety about taking a break to do something you enjoy. But if you aren't doing the things you are procrastinating about, maybe it just isn't important enough, or maybe it doesn't need to be done now at all. I think I often make the mistake of making too many things important, with the result that nothing gets done. The break helps me to realize that some of it isn't as important as I originally thought (if it was, I would have lost the client, or the world would have ended -- but the world is still here).<br><br>Taking a few hours or a few days for myself when I am completely stuck gives my subconscious a chance to get to grips with what is really important.<br><br>Go on, take a few hours off -- you know you want to.</div>

<div class="content">Nope, Wooba.  The problem is exactly that: I have taken many (many many many) hours off, and almost no hours on.  For months.  On the one project I really want to get started.  Because I know the project will be exciting and because I know the getting started part is so hard it could take unknown many hours before I get to the exciting part.  I need to reach a point where my response is neither running away nor pondering without action, because those responses haven't gotten me far.</div>

Can you say what is so difficult about that very first next thing?

If it really is difficult then consider, can someone else help or do it for you so you can move onto to the next thing you can do or is there another way to do it or, ultimately if you cannot get past this step then there will be no project so however hard, accept it and move onto something else. This final "nuclear option" can sometimes be the catalyst to unearthing the real problem or fear you face.<br><br>Hope that helps, I'm now off to take a healthy dose of my own medicine, as writing this down has given me a renewed vigor to address a project with a similar problem which I'll then follow up with some meditative reflection on some of the consequences of not doing some other procrastinating issues which are task and not project related...</div>

After trying lots of different approaches, the one thing I now do differently that is effective, is to force myself to focus on the single task before me, discarding all others, if even for that moment.

<div class="content">Simon<br><br>Like many on this forum, I have a serious procrastination problem which has cost me a lot of money and a lot of heartache. I have tried both "bottom up" methods and "Top down" methods. By bottom up I mean discovering underling reasons why I procrastinate and attempting to deal with them. Top down methods are broadly time/task management ideas, tips and tricks. <br><br>I believe you suspect the main driver of your procrastination is overwhelm. From my own experience you can end up in a horrible downward spiral- that initial feeling of overwhelm leads to avoiding starting things that you consciously know need doing  leads to paralysis and running out of energy leads to even more overwhelm and so on ad infinitum. Hence the paradox that you feel so tired after being busy doing nothing.<br>   <br>Certainly when I "goof off" because of overwhelm, it feels like a mixture of anxiety/discomfort avoidance-"I've so much to do that I can't bear thinking about it," and internal rebellion-"Bugger your goals, outcomes, whatever you call them, I'm going to read a badly written thriller all afternoon."<br><br><br>As a result of reading the useful comments here I seem to have stumbled upon a productivity  method that has worked really well for me-I know it's early days, but here goes. Please accept apologies for length of this post-I don't have a blog site to direct you to.(Note to myself-put "Investigate starting productivity blog " on AF list.)<br><br>It addresses the disconnect that occurs with any bad habit between instant reward and long term harm, uses time boxing to help reduce anxiety and task resistance, helps resistance due to tiredness and lack of focus, and gives you a reward before you start.<br>It also seems so far to have addressed being unable to get myself going again after a long break.<br><br> Try it out if practical, obviously adjusting to your circumstances. My circumstances are I work from home, am semi retired and working through a backlog  of tasks connected with closing my business down  practicing an instrument , sudying jazz improvisation and working out how I could make money from the music-Weddings, Bar Mitzvars<br>and Funerals type band anyone?<br><br>You do need a kitchen timer ideally, but if not  practical, glancing at your watch should do.<br>I will now describe what I am doing. The timings are purely based on what worked for me.<br> <br>Step One <br>Set timer to 5-10 minues. Spend some time imagining the benefits-feeling better about yoursel getting it out of the way etc of making a start on what you intend doing. Then imagine long term impact of not doing-or even short term feeling of failurewhich we numb ourselvesto.<br>Dont worry if you other thoughts intrude-hard to describe- but don't force it too much-should be a pleasant drifting feeling rather than a white-knuckle ride. In fact the first itime I did this I awoke fom a deep sleep when the timer went offafter 10 minutes.<br><br>Step Two<br>Reset timer for ten minutes and do your work.<br><br>Then simply reset timer  and repeat Step One<br>Then do 20 mins work,repeat step one then do 30 mins work.<br>Repeat as necessary.<br>I haven't tried to go beyond 30 min work bursts yet.<br>Then repeat cycle.<br>Regarding "rest" periods. The basic idea is to connect good feelings with working towards your goals, but above all give yourself a reward before doing your work, so don't make the breaks hard work for yourself-if it feels right to cut short your breaks. I find that I need shorter breaks in the morning.<br><br>Yesterday I was pretty tired in the evening,so I just cycled  through 10 mins practice, 10 mins rest.At the start of each rest period I imagined how I would have made 10 minutes progress on music compared  to calling it a day and slumping in front of the T V  I got an extra 30 mins practice out of one hour, so I've got 30 minutes practice on Charlie Parker's"Confirmation" under my belt instesd of one hour watching rubbish on T.V. That's a good deal in my books.<br><br>I've so far used this on admin type work and musical practice and it has worked extremely well. I intend to use the idea of connecting long term benefits against short tem "bad habit "gains to work on my poor eating and exercise habits.<br><br>Sorry for length.

<div class="content">Don,<br><br>No, Jim is doing something very slightly different ... very useful but different.  He is supporting his "task" with his "reason" for wanting it done.  This linkage provides natural motivation.  Covey addresses this in a very clumsy way in his books, Tony Robbins does it better in his OPA system of time management.  In Robbins approach he puts his completely defined "outcome" (several sentences of a well-formed outcome or SMART Goal) and also his "purpose", which is the larger world view of which this "outcome" is a part.  Then he puts with those the "actions" which have to be done ... and there may be several ... all on the "to do" list.  It is a bit of writing and seems as if it would be tedious but having your reason and purpose right in front of you for everything you intend to do really helps with motivation.<br><br>So, for example, you can see that the action of "mop the floor" has the outcome of "having a beautifully clean kitchen in which I feel motivated to cook healthy meals" and the purpose of "providing my spouse with tasty and healthful nutrition to keep him/her in the best physical condition because of my abiding love for him/her" ... is a lot more motivating.  (Make up your own example to see the effect ... mine seems a bit contrived ;-)  But you can see that the idea is to turn some mindless bit if drudge into a means to a big and important goal.  In the Robbins approach your To Do list looks like:<br><br>1. Action        Outcome1     Purpose1<br>2. Action<br>3. Action<br>===========================<br>4. Action        Outcome2     Purpose2<br>5. Acton<br>6. etc.<br><br>What I was suggesting is much more narrow and goes to addressing just the problem of not being able to make real the outcome of an action.  I know it seems a fine point, and it may well be that doing what Jim suggests or using the Robbins OPA method would accomplish the same thing, but maybe there is something useful to be gained by focusing more narrowly on the problem of the "disconnected time sense" that plagues the addictive personality.<br><br>I certainly think Jim's approach is a good one.<br><br>One thing that I do (from a purely mechanical perspective) is work my goals from a master Mind Map.  My bigger goals are toward the center and my smaller ones are the "leaves" on the edges.  I have at the very center six "goal areas" or what Covey and Robbins would call "roles" which all of my goals (large and small) and actions support.  (Example: Health, Finances, Personal Development, Enjoyment, Relationships, etc.)  This gives me an instant  visual perception of why I want to do anything that is on my list.  The reason I want to take t action to clean out the garage is to have it well organized so that ultimately I will enjoy life more.  Certainly enjoying life more is more motivating than sweeping out a dusty garage ;-)  I don't usually work directly from that Mind Map, but I do review it continually.<br><br>If you decide to utilize the idea of linking actions to goals and purposes be aware of one pitfall.  It may seem that writing out longish descriptions of outcomes and purposes is tedious and you can shortcut the process by using some key words.  Don't do it.  The method gets its power from the feelings of importance these things have to you.  If you reduce it to nothing more than a "tag" attached to each action, you'll lose the benefit.<br><br>I hope I answered your question in all of that ;-)</div>
<h2>Reply by Mike</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-05-24 11:37</div>
<div class="content">Oh, one more thought.  Robbins points out that another benefit of doing it his way is that you rethink your actions and often change them as you go through the process.  So you might have on your first random list of things to do "Call Joe".  When you go through the exercise you realize the reason for calling Joe is to get some information.  It might become obvious that calling someone else, or maybe waiting until tomorrow when you'll meet with Joe on some other matter makes more sense.  You might also remember some other things you should be doing to support the same outcome that  "Call Joe" supports and ought to also be doing.  So one item turns into several which get you to the outcome more efficiently and completely,.</div>

However I have also just completed Time Of Your Life (another Robbin's program) which addresses the OPA/RPM system. I'm on a mission to combine DWM & OPA/RPM. Tony's recycled ideas (from Covey, Rohn, etc) about chuncking/grouping related actions, and then assigning them meaning via Outcomes & Purposes seems to be making a huge difference in how I view my DWM list. I can envision a time where I'll drop the scaffolding of DWM, and spend more time on OPA/RPM. Having a partner in the process would be the missing piece... anyone interested in joining me?

<div class="content">Hi Mike ... Thanks for asking, as it helps me become clearer. As to how I have approached this problem ... lots of times in the past I've just used the "brute force" method, or time blocking (even setting a timer for 15 seconds!) or "the potato chip method" or the "coffee shop method" but lately I have been trying a newer (for me) strategy of really focusing on SETTING UP the task well. For example, I wanted to make some pizza dough, which in "clock time" takes only about 10 minutes, but I couldn't seem to make the transition to actually  DOING this small task! Anyway, what I did was focused on just setting up the perfect "cockpit" instead... setting out everything I needed to get the job done, as if I were doing it for someone else who was to DO the actual task, and not worrying about WHEN the task would actually be done. (Turns out I ended up doing it right away, but could have been all ready to go for the following day.) So all the flour, yeast, salt, measuring cups, mixing bowl, spoon, etc was gathered together and set out. I don't know if I'm the only person who hasn't figured this out (!) in terms of just working on the right "next step" (familiar to anyone who has done GTD, but that system never worked that well for me.) or slowing things down enough to lessen the overwhelm (?) or just "previewing" the steps of the task more clearly and deliberately .... but so far, this technique has been helping.<br><br>Not sure if that is what you meant about "setting up a number of tasks in advance", but I can definitely see setting up various projects so they are in a very "ready to go" state ... I guess kind of like a painter who has someone do all the "prep" work (which takes most of the time?!) while the painting itself is straightforward and can go fairly quickly ? <br><br>I'm not really sure if the "difficulty in making transitions" is really the root ROOT problem ... in that it might be more my chronically overwhelmed state and a problem in my overall general mental flexibility, in not knowing how to "switch gears" more easily, as it doesn't come naturally to me  ...</div>
<h2>Reply by Mike</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-06-8 20:24</div>
<div class="content">Bev,<br><br>Thanks for that explanation.  Yes, it is what I meant.  Sometimes the transition is a problem because we don't know what to do next and in that moment of confusion, we lose momentum.  By setting it up in advance, when we "come to it", it is ready to go and we don't have to "think" about anything.  That is the part of GiD that was nonsense to me in every case but this one.  IMO, taking the thinking out of doing is exactly what I do NOT want to EVER do .... except when it comes to transitional resistance like this.<br><br>Also, the psychological mind game of preparing the job site for your assistant is a great plan.  It is so much easier to help another with a problem than to work on our own.<br><br>I'm keenly aware of the pitfalls of task transition resistance.  I have begun to think of the LAST step of task A to be the prep work for task B.  It is just a simple shift of mind set.  I don't see myself starting the next task until I have completed the previous one and that is not complete until I have set up the start of the next.  I know it sounds dumb, but it is remarkably effective in overcoming that resistance.  I've not tried it yet myself but I can imagine that if I got into a real problem setting up the first step of task B as the first step of task A.  At the moment that kind of thinking makes my brain hurt ;-)<br><br>As to the timer, I could not live without one.  And yeah, even 30 seconds if the situation calls for it is good.<br><br>Lately my problem is estimating the size of tasks.  I thought it was an issue of time estimation but now I'm seeing that it has a lot more to do with evaluating my energy.  I've been getting closer to evaluating the size of the task (number of minutes) but it the middle of things I've been running out of gas.  I've been pushing too hard, I guess and just die in the midst of things.  Not good.<br><br>I already know that the biggest drain on my energy come at decision time so I try to avoid those times as much as possible be knowing what I'll be doing in advance.  But that does not fix the whole problem.  I'm thinking that what I might have to do is mix up the types of tasks so that I spread my energy around more evenly.<br><br>Anyway, that is what I'm thinking about right now ... better use of timers and some kind of intelligent load leveling.</div>

<div class="content">HI Mike,<br><br>thanks .. very much appreciate your thoughts! I think the "energy" issue is part of the fundamental "root cause" for my own "procrastination". Currently, I've been using "Sid Savara's Simple System" ... especially the (flow chart) part, "Tired? Take a Break."  :o) Means I am not very productive at all some days, but I am trying to prioritize my personal balance, (one of my life goals at the moment), so the essential trade-off is that I get to feel more balanced, but at the cost of my productivity. Hard for me to find any "happy medium" yet. (I am trying to increase my energy over the medium / longer term, but that's a whole other topic!)<br><br>The "preparing the job site" strategy comes with its own challenges too at times! Like, sometimes I find it difficult to transition into preparing the job site! I find I am needing to really slow the process down (so that I don't get overwhelmed during the first milliseconds and end up surfing the internet instead so I don't have to deal with whatever I am trying to work on!)<br><br>I like your idea of having the last step of Task A, setting up Task B, but not sure I have it in me! I do try to use the "momentum" of whatever I have done on Task A, try to carry me over until the next time block for Task A ... in other words, to mentally prepare myself for the next steps of Task A before I leave it ...<br><br>I keep trying to chip away at this problem using various strategies ... I still try to use some ideas from Neil Fiore and have experimented a little, recently, with his "Unschedule" (planning and scheduling "rewards"/breaks" and limiting project work to just 30 minutes... has maybe been marginally helpful so far...)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Alan,<br><br>>>>  Energy: My self-observation has demonstrated:<br>1) Sleeping more helps  <<<<br><br>Yes.  My problem is that I don't sleep long stretches.  I'm at my best when I get 8+ hours but I seldom sleep more than 3 hours at a time.  So naps are a must for me.<br><br>>>>  2) Caffiene helps for a few hours but makes the following 24 hours worse. It's better to wean off the stuff.  <<<<br><br>Yeah, some of this stuff is very personal.  I drink a lot of coffee and the caffeine does not affect me much at all.  Maybe I'm now desensitized to it after so many years ;-)<br><br>>>>  3) Exercise helps, when I have energy. Caffiene helps get that energy to exercise. I fear this is a hamster wheel thing. Working hard, but not much progress :-)  <<<<br><br>Personally I find that I don't need energy to exercise.  It feels as if I do but just getting out and moving overcomes that feeling and I'm good to go.<br><br>>>>  4) Low-carb diet: This either points to diabetes, or else food alergies. I discovered last year I had a wheat sensitivity. Eating a bun makes me too groggy to think. I cut out the wheat and the problem vanished.  <<<<br><br>I know that some people have specific food allergies but that is not the case with me ... nor is diabetes.  I simply don't do well with carbs.  When I cut back to nearly zero my energy goes way up.<br><br>>>>  5) Not-stopping really drains energy. If I'm thinking all evening I-should-get-some-work-done-but-I'm-too-tired-so-I-don't, that thought pattern drains my energy for that day and the next. I must give myself permission to stop and be happy about it so my mind can relax.  <<<<br><br>Exactly so.  And realize that you are, in essence, hypnotizing yourself to BE tired if you keep repeating something like that over and over.  I'd recommend that when you hear that mantra starting in your head you counter it with the opposite.<br><br>>>>  Bev: Don't forget that you can't follow "Tired? Take a break" until after you start something :-) Of course you don't have to work on it long to be started :-)  <<<<br><br>I kind of like the advice to keep making a start and the finishing will take care of itself.</div>

<div class="content">What an amazing thread I stumbled on!!<br><br>My mother used to say, "don't be like me, don't procrastinate, it's awful!" I put a lot of added stress and guilt on myself from this. Yes, I procrastinated in college, and later in grad school. But, as long as there was a deadline, things got done well, perhaps with more typos than necessary, but certainly well enough.<br><br>But the guilt and stress of procrastinating-is-bad was always there, although I was otherwise happy and successful.<br><br>That guilt vanished when I took the Myers-Briggs personality preference profile in grad school, and learned about myself and how I process information. On one of the measures I score very highly (I'm an ENFP -- Perceiver is the P for you MBTI fans out there). One trait of perceiving is "I work when I want to work, I play when I want to play." Yup, that's me! But there was more. I don't want to make a commitment to sit down and write that paper until the last moment, because what if new information comes in? What if I have a deeper realization, or a new understanding of the topic? Now someone on the other end of the spectrum is more concerned about following the timeline to do the research, write an outline, do a draft, do the final paper. But us Ps have a radically different way of processing information. <br><br>What looks like procrastination is actually highly sophisticated cognitive processes that produce a different kind of result than those achieved by people who are much more structured in their use of time and information. And I was certainly relieved to hear that there's been research done, and there's no difference in quality between the work produced by Ps and Js. <br><br>Now, fifteen years later, I've dived back into the issue of time as part of my work in how humans learn most naturally and effectively. And it turns out there's a strong neurological and cognitive argument to be made for allowing yourself permission to procrastinate. Our rational mind (the prefrontal cortex) is good for some things, but our deeper minds are dramatically more powerful. I often find myself procrastinating about writing a blog post or a chapter of a book (and feel guilty about it), but when I notice the energy going into the guilt, I stop, get curious about what my mind and body want to do, and do that. (It's almost always dealing with food, water, rest or movement). I've gone on long walks and in a flash of insight and ten minutes with a notepad, written what I had scheduled three hours to do.<br><br>Sorry for going on so long -- I surprised myself (and think that I just wrote my next blog post without thinking to!). You folks really got my mind going, so thank you. I'm glad that I found this website!</div>

<div class="content">Let me explain further what I mean by the stop thinking and do method. Doing is in fact the begining of thought. So if you don't start whatever you could think couldn't be of any use practically. All inventors or creators did great things  by trial and error, in which thought is part  of the process but not before doing anything. Procrastinating is just thinking before doing, what could be called 'anti-concrete thinking', or 'producing useless thinking'.  You procrastinate when you think you have to find reference documents before writing you report, whereas you have to start you report before, at least the outline to know what  document you really need. Whoever is procrastinating is just killing time and doesn't  make anything better. Procrastination is not necessary at all, people may use procrastination as  a way  to incubate ideas but you had better doing something different, for example sports, instead of procrastinating on your report. The incubation effect will be the same  while you accomplish something. So if you can't do now, there is  no need to think more than what you can write on your notebook for later reference.</div>

<div class="content">I'm sure I read it here someplace. Basically spend ten minutes thinking about your goal and why it's a worthy goal, how achieving it will feel good, not doing it will feel bad, reasons you can succeed, whatever motivates you, but not planning work or setting up work to work.<br>Well actually I did think a little about how I would get started. <br><br>Now I'm motivated and I work well for 25 minutes.  Then I stop for a few minutes and repeat the above. Also mix in relaxation and distraction. Then get back to work for another 25.</div>

<div class="content">One resource I've found extremely helpful (as a Thinker) is the work of Timothy Pychyl, a research professor who specializes in procrastination.  He's a blogger for Psychology Today, and has many resources (including his podcast) collected at <a href="http://procrastination.ca" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://procrastination.ca</a><br><br>He just finished his latest book, The Procrastinator's Digest.  You can get it as an e-book for $3 and finish it in a couple of hours (while you're procrastinating).  Chapter 4 is spot on for you, Simon:  "Why you won't feel like it tomorrow."  It tells the story of a Polish butcher who offered his customers: "Today you pay and tomorrow you get it for free."  But of course it's always today and tomorrow never comes.<br><br>I'd recommend the book to anyone interested in procrastination and techniques for dealing with it -- based on real world research.<br><br>More info:  <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/dont-delay/201007/the-procrastinators-digest-my-new-book-is-now-available" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/dont-delay/201007/the-procrastinators-digest-my-new-book-is-now-available</a></div>

<div class="content">For me the “just one thing” method works. Think of the one thing you would love to get done and that is often causing underlying stress and put it as the one thing to get done that day. Has been amazing for me as simple and usually what I’m not putting off I’ll do after the just one thing thing easily anyway!!! And even if only that one thing is done I’ll feel so good I’ve got through the just one thing job is all good!! No system required except for getting that one thing done!!</div>

<div class="content">That's a great article, Mark. I've been thinking about this in terms of "flow." I am very familiar with what Mark is referring to in his article above, that after a time, I start getting this oppressive feeling that I"ve got too much to do. That's usually when I start hunting for a new system. Mark's advice in his article, if I have understood it correctly, is to hunt down the Black Clouds that hang over our heads creating resistance and turn them into the current initiative. The result is what Mark referred to as "time freedom." A great place to be! <br><br>Here's the exciting thing for me. When I tried the "resistance Zero" method, I arrived at that same place of "time freedom" very quickly. Yet the method was the opposite. Instead of hunting for black clouds, I was doing low-resistance tasks. The black cloud tasks were still there, but with low resistance, they were no longer black clouds. Why was this? I think both methods improve flow. This happens to me: My work gradually gets built into a knot, and I have no idea where to start untangling it (i.e. which task to do). Both resistance zero and Black Cloud Hunt (sounds like kung-fu forms) loosen the knot. I believe the energy that keeps the knot tight is resistance; loosening the knot disperses that energy, allowing more space (i.e. time) and increasing the "flow" of my work. That's actually why I moved back to AF1. I think it's still the best method for loosening that knot. I think all of Mark's methods succeed in one way or another because they loosen the knot and increase flow. Does that make any sense?</div>

<div class="content">Are you struggling to complete tasks that you know you need to do, but can't seem to bring yourself to actually start working on them? If so, you're not alone. We've all been there at some point or another. Procrastination can be a tough habit to break, but the good news is that there are steps you can take to help overcome it and get things done. Here are some strategies for taking action on tasks that you're resisting:<br><br>Identify the root cause of your resistance. Are you feeling overwhelmed by the task? Do you lack the necessary skills or knowledge to complete it? Is it something that you just don't enjoy doing? Understanding the underlying reason for your hesitation can help you figure out the best way to move forward.<br><br>Break the task down into smaller chunks. Sometimes, the reason we resist doing a task is because it feels too overwhelming. If this is the case, try breaking the task down into smaller, more manageable pieces. This can help you feel more in control and make it easier to get started.<br><br>Set a deadline for yourself. Having a deadline can be a powerful motivator. It gives you a sense of urgency and helps you stay focused on the task at hand.<br><br>Find an accountability partner. Having someone to hold you accountable can be a great way to stay on track. This could be a friend, coworker, or even a professional accountability coach.<br><br>Reward yourself for completing the task. Give yourself a small reward for each step you complete, and save a larger reward for when you finish the task. This can help you stay motivated and give you something to look forward to.<br><br>Get into a positive mindset. Negative self-talk can be a major roadblock to getting things done. Try to shift your mindset from "I can't do this" to "I can do this, and I will do this."<br><br>Take care of yourself. Make sure you're getting enough rest, exercise, and nourishment. When we're feeling drained, it's harder to tackle tasks that require effort and focus.<br><br>Remember, it's normal to feel resistance when it comes to certain tasks. The key is to take action and find strategies that work for you to help overcome that resistance. With a little bit of effort and determination, you can get those tasks done and achieve your goals.<br><br>(Written by ChatGPT with no help at all from Mark Forster)</div>

<div class="content">Paul, I think Mark’s citation of the donkey story explains why Black Cloud and Resistance Zero approaches both work: Without a strategy, we’re often donkeys unable to choose a course of action.  Nibble-hard-first and Tackle-easy-first are strategies that give us the choice and move us forward.</div>

<div class="content">Here are some possible tips that might help you overcome procrastination:<br><br>-Break down your work into smaller and more manageable tasks. This can help you feel less overwhelmed and more confident about your ability to complete them. You can also set yourself mini-deadlines for each task and reward yourself for finishing them.<br><br>-Identify the reasons why you are procrastinating. Is it because you are afraid of failure, bored, distracted, or unsure of what to do? Once you understand the root cause of your procrastination, you can try to address it by changing your mindset, finding more interest in your work, eliminating distractions, or seeking guidance from others.<br><br>-Make a realistic and flexible schedule for your work. Plan ahead when and how you will do your work, but also leave some room for unexpected events or changes. Having a clear and concrete plan can help you stay focused and committed to your goals. You can also use tools like calendars, reminders, or timers to help you stick to your schedule.<br><br>-Find an accountability partner or a support group. Having someone who can check on your progress, give you feedback, or encourage you can make a big difference in your motivation and productivity. You can also join online communities or forums where people share their experiences and tips on overcoming procrastination.<br><br>-Be kind and forgiving to yourself. Procrastination is a common and human problem that many people face. Don’t beat yourself up for it or feel guilty about it. Instead, acknowledge your mistakes and learn from them. Remember that you are not alone and that you can always improve yourself.<br><br>I hope these tips are helpful to you and that you can overcome your procrastination problem soon. I believe in you and I wish you all the best. 😊<br><br>Best regards, Hanna from CodeIT (https://codeit.us/")</div>
