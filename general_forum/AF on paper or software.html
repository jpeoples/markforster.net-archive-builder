<div class="content">Hi,<br><br>Today I use a Moleskine soft cover note book. And I practice AF4.<br>I use a pen with multicolor. Later it will be clear to me which item is crossed or not if I use an other color.<br><br>What do you use ?<br><br>There is a thread with oneNote so this one is used ;)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Henrik,<br><br>I use a "Composition Book", one of those sewn books with a marbled cover that school kids use.  Just recently they were on a blow out back to school sale and I got some for $0.50 and others for $0.25!  Beats the hell out of those over priced $20 books LOL ;-)<br><br>If you search this site you'll get all kinds of good info.  Basically, people here have tried EVERYTHING ;-)  I can tell you from experience (mine and others) that simplest is best.  The more colors you use; the more tags; the more symbols ... the more fussing you end up doing and the less work.  That said, some things that seem to work are:<br><br>- Put a "-" or "." or "[ ]" to the left of the item.  This can be used to indicate which thing you are working on and then altered to mark the task as complete.  So if you use a "-" for example, you can turn it into a "+" when the task is done.  If you extend that to the full height of the line, you end up with a long vertical line connecting done tasks and it is easier for your eye to pick out what has yet to be done.  Likewise if you have a "[ ]" you can fill it in and then you'll have a long vertical bar if you connect them.<br><br>- Put (date) after the item if it has a due date of some kind.<br><br>- Put a small horizontal line (maybe on the left side of the page) to indicate the date the following items were added.  (I'm not sure what anyone gets out of this, except if you want to develop some kind of statistics.)<br><br>- Put (reason for doing task) after it.  This seems to help some as it reminds them of the WHY of the task and that can help in procrastination.<br><br>What has not worked well for many people:<br><br>- Tags (such as "work", "home", "project xyz".  It just clutters things up.<br><br>- Lots of colors and highlights.  YMMV, but it is visually cluttered with all of those marks.<br><br>- Progress indicators or status indicators.  There have been some elaborate systems of symbols to indicate how much work has been done and who it was delegated to, etc.  Again, the visual clutter takes over.<br><br>In all of this, YMMV, of course, but we've been at this a while (almost a year now) and have tried EVERYTHING ;-)  The bottom line is that simple is king.</div>

<div class="content">For processing tasks I like pen and paper best. For calendar items, recurring tasks, birthdays and contact information I am still pretty much reliant on software and I have found it a life saver on many occasions so I have found it pretty difficult to give up Outlook where I keep a lot of time sensitive information. Since I am in the habit of looking at an Outlook screen every day I find it works best to put as much important information on there as possible.</div>

<div class="content">Henrik,<br><br>I should clarify ...<br><br>For a long time I used a simple vertical format 5x3 inch spiral bound book I got at Sam's Club (a big box store) in packs of 10 for about $4 or so.  Very cost effective.  I was able to get 15 items on a page and there are about 140 pages.  It fit nicely in my pocket and I stuffed a pen in the spiral wire.  I found a pen that breaks in half so it is about as long as the pad is wide.<br><br>That system worked well, but ever the fiddler, I decided to try to combine all of my lists into one pocket book.  IOW, AF plus my "hot list", plus list of things to do on errands, etc.  I opted for a 5x3 Circa book ... one where you can move pages around, add, subtract, etc.  That worked very well.<br><br>I then started having trouble with the AF system, and at the same time Mark came out with AF4, which seemed to solve my concerns and I decided to start over with AF4.  Since I was starting over and I had so much trouble recently, I decided to do things more like Mark was doing them to see if maybe something I had not considered had some influence on how things worked.  So I "temporarily" started the system over moving to a format similar to the size Mark recommended.  I chose a 7.5 by 9.5 inch "composition book".<br><br>The virtue of that book is that they are dirt cheap, are sewn, are a convenient size for writing, don't have wires to hang up on things, etc.  The disadvantage is that it is too large for the pocket and thus is something one has to carry.  That is fine if you already carry a briefcase, but if you are one the go, not so much.</div>

<div class="content">My normal rule is that anything which I can't or don't want to do within two days goes into some form of reminder system. The one I use is Outlook Tasks. However the reminder is not to do the task, but to put it on my AF list.</div>

<div class="content">The problem with Evernote is that they don't include an alarm (at least not in the version I've got). This can be got round by linking the notes with the alarm in Outlook tasks, but in that case it's easier just to use Outlook if all you want is to be reminded to put the task on your AF list.</div>

<div class="content">I just looked at the Evernote reference and I still don't see the tremendous power of Evernote for TM systems.  I have Evernote installed.  I have used it for clipping articles.  But beyond that, not much.  (It is interesting that even the website for Evernote does not have suggestions of how to use it in any creative way.  I mean, taking a picture of wine labels ... that's really reaching ;-)  Its real power is in its ability to do OCR on photographs and let you retrieve them by searching on a word in the picture.  But even that feature is somewhat limited by the quality of cell phone cameras.  They sell the idea of taking pictures of business cards but if you try it you find that the focal length of most cell cameras is all wrong and to get a clear picture, you get text so small that you can't read it.<br><br>OneNote is currently a more powerful product for simply compiling information.  What it lacks, that Evernote has, is a web interface.  (And for that matter, its cell phone interface is pathetic.)  But this may be solved by the end of the year when 2010 is scheduled to come out.<br><br>In any case, as it stands now, Evernote as a Tickler solution is much like a paper solution.  You write things down and look at them periodically.  If that is sufficient (and it is for me) then fine.  The power of electronic ticklers is in the notification.  I don't see Evernote making progress in these areas ... they seem to be focusing more on expanding the platform than adding significant function.  As it is now it lacks:<br><br>- Strong Editing Features<br>- Note based encryption<br>- File based encryption<br>- Notebook based encryption<br>- Encryption of PDFs<br>- Alarms<br>- and that is just the top few needs.<br><br>But for what it does well, it does it well ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Mike:<br><br>I agree with you about Evernote. I always feel I *should* be using it more than I do, but then I can't actually think of anything to use it for. As it is I keep it for odd clippings and random thoughts, nothing much else. The most useful thing I do with it is keep future quotes for the "To Think About" bit on my website.<br><br>It's a bit of a solution in search of a problem as far as I'm concerned.</div>

<div class="content">Been doing this since the first Beta began back on 5th Jan. <br><br>Agree simple is best - tried it on OneNote, and Blackberry, and a notebook (one for work, one for everything else, both on me at all times except when socialising) works the best. <br><br>A5 has been the best format, and my favourite notebooks are still the £2.50 Buroclass exercise books from Ryman. Not too big, not too small. Experimented with cheaper alternatives and got tired of the ink bleedthrough. <br><br>They're very popular but I hate Moleskines - I detest their very ubiquity and the plain black covers and cream paper for some reason really offend my sense of aesthetics.<br><br>If you want notebook porn, I am longing for a Leathersmith notebook in aquamarine pigskin - not nearly as expensive as Smythson, and just as gorgeous. They do matching diaries too. £££ though. Sigh. Maybe not in this economy.</div>

<div class="content">The current version of Evernote is great for clipping and ready access to your clips via almost any means (local storage synchronized with online storage, iphone, blackberry, etc.).  Tagging is rudimentry, especially compared to ver 2.2.  Searches are pretty powerful, but only if you really dig in to customize them (too hard).<br><br>So for retrieval, Evernote version 2.2 is still superior to the current version while the current, web based, version (Ver 3) is better for clipping and accessibility.  In my experience, ver 2.2 was MUCH better at managing tasks in just about any flavor, especially if you wanted to sort or filter in any way for any reason.  But it isn't very portable and it isn't web based.</div>

Text and images can be encrypted in any note<br><br>But I'm not talking about "text encryption".  I specifically indicated the kind of encryption I desired.  And I'm far from alone ... the gang on the Evernote forum are about to riot because the clamor they have raised about the weak encryption has been ignored.  And I'm not sure what you mean by encrypted images.  I'm pretty sure that you can't do that.  I'll have to check later to verify it.<br><br>>>> - so what are you referring to by "file-based"  <<<<br><br>Encryption of files, which cannot now be done.<br><br><<<, "notebook-based" etc? (This is just my ignorance.)<br><br>Encryption of notebooks ... which you can't now have.  The ONLY thing you can do is encrypt a selected bit of text ... not the whole note (as a note).  I mean, you can open the note and select all of the text in it and then encrypt it.  But that is not encrypting the whole note ... even though the end result is the same.<br><br>And encryption of PDFs is also not supported.  You probably don't have the same needs that others of us have.  Obviously the folks at Evernote think that encryption of selected portions of text from a note is all that is needed.  Unfortunately, it takes too long to encrypt bits and pieces.  It is far preferable to encrypt at the note, notebook, and file level.  It is so odd to me that they can't get that we have a need.  (BTW, their answer to all of this is that we can use TrueCrypt to encrypt files, then upload them, then download them again to TrueCrypt and decrypt them.  LOL ;-)  We could always have done that.  The whole point of Evernote is to be able to search the notes ... without that, why bother with Evernote?)<br><br>Beyond that, the real show stopper is no encryption for PDFs.  It boggles my mind that they don't get the importance of that simple thing.  Obviously, there is some big impediment to implementing it.  They keep saying that it is done "for our protection".  LOL ;-)  The idea is that in order to allow full encryption and searching they would have to transfer the password and that would be dangerous for us.  Much more dangerous than leaving the documents in the clear!  ROTFLMAO ;-)<br><br>>>>  And how much stronger do you want the editing features to be?<br><br>Well, I don't much care.  I'm just observing that the text editing is pretty basic.</div>

IOW, in order to allow you to search encrypted files you'd have to send them the password and they claim that is not secure.  Also, they would have to decrypt, search, and re-encrypt.  They don't want to pay that computational overhead.  Others (on the forum) have said they would be willing to pay.

<div class="content">I don't use Evernote, but um, https should be all you need for secure data transfer?  You log in, and then all data is transferred back and forth over an encrypted data stream.  The data is stored either side as a plain document, but nobody can access the data without your password.  And nobody can see your search queries or the responses unless they are looking at your screen.</div>

<div class="content">MartyH, Mike, Learning ...<br><br>You've confirmed me in my belief that EverNote v2.2 is far superior to v3 for my needs - which don't involve accessing my EN files from different locations - I just keep them on my PC. But I certainly haven't put much effort into comparing the versions, the way MartyH evidently has.<br><br>EN v2.2 has ample formatting of notes - bolding, italicizing, highlighting, indention, bulleting, auto-numbering ... And it's trivially easy to encrypt the whole content of a note, and, as Mike says, "the end result is the same". And yes, Mike, it encrypts images in exactly the same way as text - the image vanishes and is replaced by a row of dots. I'm surprised if it's any different in v3.<br><br>I don't think there's a satisfactory way of capturing a PDF in a v2.2 note - it's a matter of copying and pasting text - very clunky.<br><br>So v2.2 works fine for a deskbound worker like me. If I get a Windows-enabled laptop, I'll carry EN around with me on a thumbdrive, rather than try to access it via the Net. <br><br>I keep my AF4 work list in a single EN note. It has, as I say, ample formatting ability - though I find the list works best if kept in a simple bulleted list, with the absolute minimum of fussy formatting. I tried having one task per note, but that also seemed too fussy. However, there could be advantages,and I might try it again some time.</div>

Ordering products use it.  It's up to the website host to use it or not.

<div class="content">Hi,<br><br>Here is my current setup is:  ( AF4)<br><br>1- I use a Moleskine "Ruled Reporter Notebook - Large" that make my list very long without turning a page. ( Hope you follow what I mean)<br>2- For Todo/tasks that are more than 5 days away I put them in a Google Calendar so I get a SMS reminder to put them back to my List<br>3- On the run if I found a task todo I put it on my Moleskine. ( If the task is to be done > 5 days away will I put it in my Google calendar when I review my AF List)<br><br>So my answer is I use Notebook for my task and software as reminder tool.<br><br>I have tested to have my list on my Ipod or my Android phone but what I found is that write the information on paper is ten times quicker, => So I write down all tasks. <br>When I use "software" I didn't put all task on my list "Small task was not on the list".</div>

<div class="content">FWIW, https is trivially easy to setup if they have the apache web server, which is the de facto standard used by almost everyone except the few guys using Microsoft's C#. Just sayin'.<br><br>Oh, and I use a spiral bound (across the top), Gregg ruled notebook (with a line down the middle—which allows for two columns of tasks); looks to be 4x6 inches. Why? Because they're supplied by my office! Though, Mike's comments above about the marks down the column remind me of PCEO's fill-in-the-bubble, which would be convenient and aestheticly pleasing—to my eye at least.  <br><br>Michael</div>

<div class="content">Mike said:<br><br>"I already have a case for my iPhone. I got one of those bullet proof cases because the lady at the store showed me her phone ... the screen was shattered and held together with cellophane shipping tape. And the damn company has no insurance you can buy."<br><br>Mike, it's true you can only get a warranty, not loss or damage insurance from Apple. But you can get insurance from your iPhone from <a href="http://www.safeware.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.safeware.com/</a><br><br>I get laptop insurance from them for my MacBookPro. Considering the design classes I teach and the distractions of 20 students, the hazards of my own studio, my coffee drinking habits and four cats, the peace of mind this insurance provides is a bargain.<br><br>I'd consider insuring my iPhone, but it's nearing the  point where I can upgrade to the new version, so its loss value is minimal right now. I do have a case which is silicon with a hard plastic shell that protects the back and corners. The case has protected the phone through several drops on concrete.</div>

<div class="content">Liz,<br><br>Thanks for that link.  I read through the site and got a quote.  I'm puzzled at what the deal is with these phones.  First I was puzzled about why I could not get insurance through either Apple or AT&T.  The iPhone is the ONLY phone that AT&T sells that they won't give insurance on.  The quote from that site was $108 for only ONE year ... you can't get insurance for longer than that ... and this is true ONLY for the iPhone.  Also, the policy amount is only $500, and I think the replacement cost of the phone is $700.  If I'm right about that, I'd be paying $100 to get $500 to pay $700 for a replacement, which amounts to a $300 out of pocket cost if I needed to invoke the policy.  As I said, I'm puzzled about the strange things about this phone.</div>
