<div class="content">Hi everyone,<br><br>I see a potential problem with long projects / tasks in AF2. For example if I have a big project A and big project B, I would add them both to the end of the list. It would look like this:<br><br><--some other tasks --><br>Project A<br>Project B<br><br>I start working on B. After some time I would get enough of it and mark it as completed. But it's a long project and it's not really completed, so I would reenter it at the bottom. Then I would switch to project A and work in the same manner. The problem is that after completing A I might be really tempted to switch to B again. The result might look like this:<br><br><--- some tasks ---><br>Project C<br><--- some more tasks ---><br>Project A (attended)<br>Project B (attended)<br>Project A (attended)<br>Project B (attended)<br>Project A (attended)<br>Project B (attended)<br>Project A<br>Project B<br><br>Projects A and B would capture most of my attention while C somewhere in the middle gets ignored. This probably happens due to switching over to an open list instead of using a closed one.<br><br>In AF1 I had a different problem when after completing a portion of project A on page 3 I would reenter the next portion at the end of the list on page 5. It took too long to get to the next part. Now if I could combine the best parts of AF1&AF2...</div>

<div class="content">I'm not sure this is a problem. If you read through the entire list at the start of the day and then realize that Project C is becoming important, you would feel inclined to do something towards it even if every other item on your list was A & B related...assuming A & B were less important to you in that moment.</div>

<div class="content">Tamagochi:<br><br>I think I agree with Frank. If Project C is becoming urgent then it should have registered as such in your mind, and you will be drawn to do it. If it's not urgent, then it doesn't really matter.</div>
