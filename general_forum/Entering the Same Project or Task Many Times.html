<div class="content">I'll blame outside forces on the latest need to reboot. Too much work on a few projects, not enough on maintenance, and now I'm spinning my wheels rather than focusing.<br><br>From experience, I know the best way to start a reboot is a brain dump, followed by reading the entire list and picking a few that stand out.<br><br>Result: The long list seems to grow, but most of the lines are repeats of things that are already in the book -- and I know it when brain-dumping. It still needs to be written, though, during today's brain dump, or it keeps poking me so I can't concentrate.<br><br>Theory: It's usually a non-urgent task, but one that will give me a sense of accomplishment, or one that will clear a backlog. I feel guilty doing those when there are unspecified more urgent tasks. However, those are the ones that give me the biggest boost, or that cause me the most distress. Or maybe it's one I need to officially move off the active list.<br><br>The AF series is great for this. I see it on page 1 (or group 1 or however the system chunks things). Something else on that page is more important, or, if it's the last thing on the page, I dismiss it. There's bound to be something on a later page that's more urgent. But there it is on page 5. And again on page 10. Sooner or later I see the repeated line beside something I know is urgent, but the repeated line feels even more urgent. So I finally do it. On my next pass, I get to cross it out on all those earlier pages, which feels very productive. That crossing out is productive, since it boosts my mood with very little effort.<br><br>Does anyone else find writing the same line, possibly with variations, with each brain dump helps?</div>

<div class="content">Quite the opposite, when I tried AF for a while I found the constant re-writing and re-scanning of items to be a real drain.  Fiddling with the list ended up just another form of procrastination with an associated cost.</div>

<div class="content">I find that having duplicate items on the list -- and KNOWING I have duplicate items -- reduces my focus.  There's a vague feeling that even if I don't do the item now, I will find it later.   This makes each particular instance of a task have less "punch" to it. <br><br>With a short list, it's easy to eliminate the few duplicates that may get entered inadvertently.   With a longer list, it's a lot harder.<br><br>From my own experience, if an AF or FV list is so long that eliminating duplicates quickly is painful or impossible, it may be a sign that one should try DIT and get one's overcommitment problem under control.  :-)</div>

<div class="content">...OR just get on and start the @*&@*& task and get it done!  There's far too much pushing peas around the plate and navel gazing, and not enough eating going on... and then people post to say they're hungry and might a different plate help.  No, it won't!<br><br>It's the productivity equivalent of telling everyone they're a victim but it's okay because we're all victims and to be expected.  It drives me mad because it's such a subservient attitude, it's a desire to be controlled instead of facing your tasks and just getting started.<br><br>Just man up and get going and your tasks will melt away without needing to label and analyze, which don't get me wrong is great fun but don't you DARE pretend to yourself that it's anything other than more putting off facing your tasks.  "Just one more iteration of The System, this is the one, I'm so close I can feel it!"  You won't fool me but the point is that you'll fool yourself and you know it.<br><br>Grrr!  That task, the one that appears 27 times in your list and which you're wondering how to manage yet again?  Switch the computer off and go and damn well start it right now.</div>

<div class="content">Hey Chris! Why don't you tell us what you REALLY think?<br><br>More seriously, I share with you the frustration I feel when I read of people who change their systems more often than I change my underwear. Tinkering with one's system is, 99% of the time, detrimental. The whole benefit of having a system is . . . that it is a system. The particulars of the system really are less important than the fact that tasks are documented and completed in an organized, repeatable fashion.<br><br>That said, there are some of us (that means I am including myself) who recognize that there are opportunities for us to improve our behavior. I would not label myself as a "victim," because, that suggests to me that I believe that there is someone else who is a victimizer. Rather, there is a level of excellence that I aspire to attain and I believe that there are methods and habits that conduce towards that.<br><br>I believe that such methods and habits are effective only if they are used consistently over an extended period of time. Therefore, I agree with you that those who fiddle constantly with their systems are procrastinating and exacerbating their problems.<br><br>Where I disagree, is when you criticize those who "label and analyze." I do not believe that this is NECESSARILY a form of displacement. That is to say, it COULD be a kind of procrastination, but it need not be. Labeling and analyzing can lead to greater self-understanding, and, sometimes, greater self-control. From your post, I assume that you would agree that self-control is something we should all value.</div>

<div class="content">I agree with Chris somewhat. <br><br>I like systems only because they are fun and interesting. Because they are fun and interesting, I use the system more and by using it more I do more and by doing more I become more productive. <br><br>Now, when the system you choose is either not fun, or causes analysis paralysis or causes you to play too much with it and choose the wrong things (not important things) to do routinely...then stop playing with it. <br><br>As Chris put it, eat your damn peas and man (woman) up.   You could remind yourself 100 times to eat them, but if you don't physically do it, it won't get done.  it's actually impossible to get anything done if you don't do it.  Algorithms/systems/lists /alarms/ schedules/all the organization of 1000 computers and apps don't get things done. Only you do. <br><br><br>However, I disagree with Chris, as af has been the most productive and fun system I've used. <br><br>To answer the post question, I believe rewriting/ duplicating entries makes no difference to me.   for me, I like to brain dump as often as I need to. Anything on my mind and irritating me belongs on a list.  If I have plenty of duplicates, them something is nagging me and I have several reminders on the list to do it. So I don't care. What is most important is choosing the right things to do and then doing them.</div>

<div class="content">The tendency to re-enter items and get kinda lost is a reaction to overwhelm - whether short-term because of a crunch or long-term because of chronic over-commitment.<br><br>In those cases, just "manning up" isn't the solution.   <br><br>For example, on most days, I just punch right through my DIT list.   No problem.   I usually just go straight down the list.   Keeps it simple.   I skip items that can't be done right now for some reason (context, etc.).<br><br>Some days I have too many meetings, or other time sinks, and can't get through the list.   So I start building up a couple days of minor backlog.  No big deal -- after a day or two I usually have enough time to punch through it all, same as usual.<br><br>But if I start falling behind, and can't get through the list, then I've got to take some kind of action.   If the list has gotten so long that I don't have a clear idea what's on it, then I might do a "brain dump" like Cricket suggests, just to make sure I am addressing the most critical and pressing things.   But then I've got to go look and see why I am behind, and get it fixed.   It might be just to declare a backlog and then punch through it.   It might be to trim my commitments.   Or both.<br><br>Bottom line:   If "manning up" doesn't work, there are other problems that need to be addressed, and brute force won't fix it.    Tinkering and puttering certainly won't fix it either, to Chris' point.</div>
