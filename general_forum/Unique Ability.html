<div class="content">I'm about halfway through the book "Unique Ability - Creating the Life You Want".  It's a good read, definitely on par with Marcus Buckingham's work on strengths and better than Clifton's earlier work.  Also a little more practical than the other two with action plans and all that good stuff.  <br><br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Unique-Ability-Creating-Life-Want/dp/1896635628/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1272486632&sr=1-1" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Unique-Ability-Creating-Life-Want/dp/1896635628/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1272486632&sr=1-1</a><br><br>I did a lot of this kind of work back when I decided to excel in my career a few years ago and it really paid off.  Whenever I've ignored this kind of work and gone for more money or promotions just because, I've sometimes paid the price of not enjoying what I was doing.  And if you don't enjoy what you're doing - good luck with doing well with it.  Now that I'm moving on to something like retirement (!?!) it's a good resource to figure out what could be next outside of the world of work.  <br><br>Anyway, I prefer this kind of thing to the more nebulous and usual "passion, purpose and mission statement" because it's just plain worked IMHO.  YMMV</div>
