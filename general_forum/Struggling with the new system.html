<div class="content">Am I the only one finding this system hard to work?  It started well on Monday, when the list was fairly brief,  but now it's Friday I seem to just spend time procrastinating over all the tasks I have available to do!<br>I think I'm struggling to be disciplined in writing down everything that needs to be done (although I never struggled with this under DIT), so in the back of my mind I'm always thinking "am I really doing the best thing now?".  I know I should trust the system but I just wondered if anyone else was feeling a bit phased by the lists.<br>Cheers</div>

<div class="content">I think it's about getting the hang of 'standing out' - see Mark's main topic on this.  Once I'd got that the rest seemed to fall into place.  Originally I had to print out my list and mull on it for a while, but now I just read down the items on my screen (quickly through, then slowly one-by-one ) and do what comes naturally.  After a while you become familiar with the pages, unless several new things have been added, and I'm finding now that as I finish one thing I sometimes "know" what is next without having to look.  And if you are procrastinating over a specific task, just do a tiny thing - maybe even just go and look at it.<br><br>I do have to remember to keep a jotter with me to capture the new things that come up.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Andy<br><br>I too had a little trouble at first as I was cycling through my pages too slowly and also realised I was starting to build resistance to some tasks even when they 'stood out'. I realised I was trying to do too much of a task at once (or rather thinking I had to do too much of it, possibly even to completion). <br><br>Once I realised this is what I was doing I allowed myself to just do a little bit on any item that stood out - if that felt right at the time - and my speed increased while my resistance disappeared.<br><br>Hope this helps?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Andy, I couldn't get my head around AF at all when I returned to work today (it has been working fine at home). I panicked and had to revert to DIT! However I'm going to persevere for at least a few weeks to give myself a chance. But I must say the idea of constantly cycling through pages and pages of items does not fill me with enthusiasm at the moment! In support of DIT I initially returned to work on monday following christmas holidays and I had virtually no tasks to do, which for me meant that me and DIT had been managing things very well indeed.</div>

<div class="content">Andy,<br><br>I too have been struggling with the system. Using DIT lingo, I have had a hard time integrating recurrent and same-day tasks. I feel stressed knowing that there are still some open recurrent or same-day tasks to do and they are not on the current page. I then scan the page for something to do so that I can get off that page and onto a page with one of those recurrent or same-day tasks. <br><br>But I do recognize that this system is devilishly clever. I daresay brilliant. It ingeniously uses a very basic principle of behaviorist psychology: no reward until I do something that I know is important (but maybe not urgent) first.<br><br>So, yes, I am struggling. Yes, I am feeling stressed doing AF. And, yes, I can see that it might have enormous potential.<br><br>Standard DIT made work a bit of a game. Would I get my list done by the end of the day? If I did, I'd get a point and add another day to my winning streak. But it was a rather gentlemanly game. I could stack the deck by making my list short. And, of course, if it was getting close to the end of the day, I could do very little work on a large number of tasks. The thing was that I could waste 45 minutes (or 3 hours and 45 minutes) and, as long as I got the list done, get a victory.<br><br>AF is a game at 10 times the speed of DIT. Sure, I can goof off, if I put it at the end of my list. To get there I will usually need first to review MANY outstanding items that I have on my plate. By the time I get to my goof-off item, I don't feel like goofing off for too long. It's a lot harder to fool myself into thinking that I can relax because I'm in good shape. <br><br>Now, in a strange way, these recurrent and same-day tasks serve a role not unlike goof-off items: they are the motors that drive the system. I am on page 15, and the bank balances that I must examine each day, and which I have not gotten to yet, are on page 12. I am starting to worry because it's been a very hectic day with computer malfunctions, telephone equipment problems, and urgent in-bound phone calls. It's starting to get late and I still have this open recurrent task. It's time to bear down and work the system. I do a little bit of this and a little bit of that. Like an American football player, I slowly work my way down the field by making one play after another. Eventually I make it to the end of the list and then back to page 12. <br><br>Am I happy? Not really. I just wanted to look at my bank balance when I wanted to look at it. The system forced me to confront everything else that was on my plate. But does it advance my long-term good better than alternative methods? I am willing to entertain the possibility that it might.<br><br>Will I stick with AF? That remains to be seen. Monday and Tuesday, I wasn't doing it correctly and they were horrendous days. Wednesday I did standard DIT and reviewed Mark's clarifications. Thursday and Friday I did AF. It made me uncomfortable. But many games are not easy the first time they are played.</div>

<div class="content">Moises, I have found that I have dealt best by, at present, scheduling the things which I  must do each day by a certain time such as your bank balance example just whilst i get used to the system and learn to trust it (just as a safety net!). i am now putting them on the list too and seeing how that works, i.e. am i doing them at a different time, sill addressing them? So far the answer is YES.<br><br>Stick with it and good luck.</div>

<div class="content">I too have taken a leap of faith and thrown everything into the AF mix but with a certain degree of trepidation. I expected that scheduled tasks would go awry for some time and I would probably revert to putting them back on my calendar. Now I'm not so sure.<br><br>There is one task I normally schedule for 4pm on Fridays but it was now listed as just one of 120 or so potential tasks in Autofocus. Yesterday (Friday) I was working down a page as I had been doing all day, when this very task positively leapt off the page and said 'Do me'. I looked at my watch and it was exactly 4pm. Coincidence or what?</div>

<div class="content">Moises and Linda:<br><br>Just a couple of points to bear in mind. In the instructions I say that you need to use common sense with this system. If something needs doing immediately, then do it immediately. <br><br>The instructions also say that the system is not suitable for things that need to be done at a specific time.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>"Day-specific" and "time-specific" are not easy to define. I arrive early at work, before most other people arrive. It's usually more peaceful for the 1st 45 minutes. There are some recurring tasks that I prefer to do at that time, but I don't have to do at that time.<br><br>AF is forcing me to confront whether I want to block that time off for those recurring tasks which might be best for that time slot. <br><br>I think many of us know that some parts of the day are better for some tasks. I will need to look very carefully, perhaps expanding my notion of time-specific tasks. Thanks for the reminder.<br><br>moises</div>

Can you trust AutoFocus enough to believe you'll get to it today? <br><br>One thing I find is that I go to the list with an INTENT in mind.

<div class="content">Hi ds, I've decided to keep a loose structure of a day - typed out as sort of a closed list which starts of with emptying my inboxes at home and then at work. This saves me the anxiety of forgetting to do it and the hassle of re-writing it everyday.</div>

<div class="content">ds<br><br>Approaching the list looking for an item can inhibit the way the system works.  A suggestion may be to treat routine tasks that you need to do each day in the same way as a "stack the dishwasher" type of task.  Mark suggested in one post either just doing it as part of a meal routine, or adding it to the list to let AF sort out.  If adding it to the list is not working for you and causing concern, why not literally treat it as part of a meal routine and decide to do it at lunch time every day?  Just a thought .........</div>

<div class="content">Hi <br>By going back thru all the previous posts that have started with AF you will find alot of what you are concerned about has been touched on previously with some great ideas and support coming from other AF's.<br><br>Also I'm abit confused<br>Are you saying that you have 15 pages total?<br>then would'nt the time look abit like this (give or take)<br>skim page 1 (and you have bank on your mind) so 1 item stands out do it for 30 secs 1 minute (as you'd rather be doing bank stuff first) - move on<br>page 2 - 11 the same so almost 1/4 hr later youre at page 12<br>and you do the bank stuff.. now put it at the end of page 15 ready for the next day or to do another quick look at when you are scanning page 15<br><br>But also commonsence is crucial.. if bank is important and needs to be done first...THEN DO IT FIRST.<br><br>I find AF helps me with confirming whether there is an urgency about an item or I just WANT to do it now.<br>If it is urgent to do then it really becomes a time specific item and doesn't get put on the AF<br>But you can put on the list ""check (recheck) time specific list""<br><br>I'd still really suggest looking at older posts as well tho as they have been great</div>

<div class="content">Good advice. If you really must do the banking today, then I guess it should be on the calendar, not in AF.<br><br>After much reading here, that seems to be the answer to many of my questions. AF seems to be the repository for all the items that you COULD do, assuming that there's not something that you currently MUST do.<br><br>Is that a fair summation? <br><br>ds</div>

<div class="content">"AF seems to be the repository for all the items that you COULD do, assuming that there's not something that you currently MUST do."<br><br>Fair summation, except that I'd make a distinction between MUST do's and TIME-DEPENDENT tasks. MUST dos can live on the AF list, which handles them well, but I stick time-dependent tasks on my diary - and set an alarm if it's critical to do the job at the scheduled time.<br></div>
<h2>Reply by Christine B</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-01-11 11:34</div>
<div class="content">Critical tasks and time dependent tasks do obviously need to be done when necessary.  Just an observation, but it can help to include the time dependent tasks as well for a while and let AF review them.  You may find that some tasks are not as time dependant as you think, or the timing may be able to be changed to something more appropriate.  Not always possible but AF provides a good tool for questioning.  Once you know they are definite "must do's at x time" then they can be taken off the list and just scheduled.  Don't forget the regular "check schedule" task though :-)</div>

<div class="content">I know I talk about "trusting the system" and so on, but it is important to remember that the system is not some magic thing out there which tells us what to do completely unrelated to what our own personal views are!<br><br>The system is a framework designed to enable US to balance our rational and intuitive minds so we make BETTER decisions. It's still us in charge, and if we find that we are 15 pages away from an urgent item that has to be done in the next ten minutes, then for goodness sake JUST DO IT!!</div>

<div class="content">One thing I like about the autofocus system is that it forces you to apply some common sense. I think a lot of the qualms and queries people have about the system seem to stem from the idea that we must treat the system as gospel and are not *allowed* to do something that's somewhere further down the list when we're currently on a different page...<br><br>If you're on page 4 and suddenly an item that you know is on page 15 pops in your mind and you feel like it would be a good idea to do it right now, then just do it... If someone rings you who is on your list to call, but on another page than the one you're working on, would you say, no, I can't talk to you now because calling you is on my list further down? You wouldn't do that with another time management system either.<br><br>Mel has summarised this beautifully in her post under "A common sense approach to AF" <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/624100" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/624100</a> and Christine B also gives some good examples under "Urgent items on a later page" <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/624014" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/624014</a><br><br>The list is not there to stop us from doing things we need to do. It's designed to make life easier, allowing us to be less of a slave to our daily task list while still making sure that everyting we need to do gets captured and will get done at some point. No more and no less.</div>

<div class="content">I think the "common sense" Mark mentions often cannot be stressed enough. I have all my tasks in my AF list (well, the "someday/maybe" list not yet) and tasks with a hard deadline have their due date left of the check mark square highlighted  with a text marker. Thus I can start to work on them much earlier than the due date tells me, if they "stand out" during the regular scans. On the other hand I can easily find items due today which forces me to tackle them first (and actually this happens rarely since quite a lot of the dated items are checked off much earlier than their due date thanks to AF).</div>

<div class="content">I wonder if there is an issue here about understanding what sort of list you create under AF (which I'm enjoying experimenting with by the way, and finding that you do indeed need to work with it to develop a better understanding of it). <br><br>Traditional to-do lists are 'must do' lists but because they are also open lists the upshot is you never get to the end of the work you must do. DIT introduced the idea of a closed list, and achieved closure by batching together all the work you 'will do' tomorrow. Now with AF you still have a closed list, with enclosure achieved just by working off one page at a time (there is nothing magic in using one day as the unit of closure). However whereas with DIT the list was of items you 'will do' that day, with AF the list is of items you 'might do' in the near future (deliberately vaguely defined). This seems to me a fundamental shift from DIT. It means that unlike either the traditional to do list or the DIT list, entering an item on an AF list does not mean you are committed to do it. Of course you might feel strongly inclined to do it when you enter it but one thing the system does is test out the real strength of that commitment, crucially when it is being tested against other things you might do. Now, an item that you feel inescapably committed to doing at a particular time, or one that you feel  totally committed to doing right now regardless of where it is on a list, does not fit into this system. The answer is to do just what Mark suggests: if you overwhelmingly feel the need to do an action right now, just do it. If you are committed to actioning something at a particular time, then ensure you have a system that will remind you at the appropriate time and when it reminds you then just do it. <br><br>It seems to me that this difference in the type of list you are working with in AF is important and perhaps not been fully brought out in the discussions I have read - although I haven't read them all. It perhaps accounts for the struggles some report with the system, because their expectation is still to create lists of what they definitely will do.</div>

<div class="content">Am I doing it wrong, or just adjusting the system to me? Sometimes before I start my bedtime routine, I read through my entire list and flag anything that MUST be done the next day.  Not something that is coming up urgent and should be done in the next few days, not anything that is just nagging me.  Something that will cause me to be fired, incur a late fee, or break a promise if it is not done (or some part of it is not done) tomorrow.  I hard schedule this into my next day, noting I will do it first thing, or after lunch, or whatever.  Then I can go about my bedtime routine, winding down my day without worrying about something that I might forget to do tomorrow.  I work my list per procedure the next day, with the exception of the time I have set aside for the urgent task.  Then I am not worrying about urgent task on page ten when I am on page 4.  Oddly enough, I rarely find anything this urgent, but it gives me peace of mind to know I haven't missed anything.</div>

<div class="content">+AJPM+<br><br>I cannot see anything wrong with that.  In fact, what you are doing that is one of the tenets of DIT, another of Mark Forster's systems: the current initiative.  That is, "you start your work everyday by concentrating on one selected initiative."  And in your case, it's "Something that will cause me to be fired, incur a late fee, or break a promise if it is not done (or some part of it is not done) tomorrow."  In other words, your current initiative is "maintaining your integrity."  And that's admirable.  So relax! ^___^</div>
