<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-02-26 13:56</div>
<div class="content">I started off at the beginning of the beta test period, got going quite quickly, adapted AF to my lifestyle (working abroad mostly).  I was enthused by my new productivity vs ny inherent procrastination.<br><br>The I tried to go electronic so that my Pocket PC Phone (Windows Mobile) would have a synchronised copy with my desktop/laptop.  A brief foray with My Life Organised was abandoned, it reeked of too much overhead a la GTD, so I retreated back to paper.<br><br>My next stop on this never-ending quest to find out what's right for me (and AF has been better than all the others in which I have sought "perfection" - part of my problem, I know!) has been ListPro (laptop + PPC, synchronised) which has been set up so that I can see the list shrinking as I cross items off, group items according to a handful of Status conditions (Completed, Defer to Do Later, Dismissed for Review, DIT Closed List, Reminder, Task Scheduled) etc.<br><br>BUT, I have found I am not screening my AF list as often I I did with the Paper method.  It's been great to be able to sit next to my sleeping Mum in hospital and review my AF items on ListPro.  It almost seems that once items are solely in electronic format, I shy away.<br><br>Some users have mentioned that paper is the only way, but I'd alike to hear from those who are using both paper and electronic simultaneously, which does seem to make things more drawn out, but maybe is practical for some people.<br><br>After all, what really matters is what works for each of us individually in the long-run.<br><br>ChristineB: any links to this situation from earlier posts?</div>

<div class="content">I hear you Roger. I never thought I would be a paper person, I have horrible handwriting, I spill coffee on my pages, etc. I had a good trusted system set up on GTD principles that I used for years. I did trust it-- everything was in there-- but not everything got done.<br><br>Forgoing that system completely (which scared the daylights of me at first) and going to a purist approach to Autofocus on paper helped me get many more things done and better intuitive prioritzation than I ever had electronically. I just had to let go...</div>

<div class="content">I second your stand point, as I experience the same way.<br> <br>As said in another thread, if one need more information than tackled by AF, one need another time management system.<br><br>Let's be clear: IS tool are - with no doubt - much better in getting/tracking complementary information (links to todo, backlinks from todo to documents, due/horizon/completion dates, sort and select from various ways, and so on).<br><br>A paper list only is needed and recommended (by me) for AF to gain from its brilliant simplicity, as any IS tool will give more 'paperwork' - for an IS tool -:) - overhead, as less items per page and/or more difficult to maintain and/or won't work "instantaneousely" (leadtime to open) and/or less quick to jot an idea and/or we poorer view and/or ...<br><br>IMHO and very not-dogmatic approach, just my stand point!<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Roger<br><br>I think I need to look at updating the FAQ's again but am trying to work on a way to do that more efficiently, as it almost needs reviewing and adding to daily!<br><br>There are so many posts on electronic solutions and I do like the look of Andreas's online system, but for me an electronic system needs to able to reproduce not merely lists of items, but provide all of the flexibility of AF, including it's uncanny ability to access our intuitive side.  I love gadgets and would normally be the first to jump on any gadget based bandwagon but the fact is that for me paper AF is what works.<br><br>However, there are occasions when I want to be able to look at some of the information in my lists differently.  As you know I use OneNote to supplement my notebook but the notebook is my system - OneNote is merely an add-on.  Using OneNote as an add-on deals with all of the occasional "wants" that I have with my notebook.  For example if I want to view all of the tasks linked to a particular project I can do so.  If I want to view just my home tasks I can do so.  If I want to send a task to Outlook I can do so. If I want to search my lists I can do so.  If I want to print out a copy of my lists to take somewhere rather than my notebook I can do so.  If I lose my notebook I have a back-up!<br><br>It takes such a minimal amount of time to use that there is virtually no overhead and of course it links straight in to my diary, project management system, and email.  The time element of running two systems really is negligable but the benefits are significant.<br><br>Roger, I'll email you a couple of screen prints so you can see how my OneNote is set up.<br><br>Hope that helps a little ........?</div>

<div class="content">Christine, <br>If you don't mind sharing the screen prints, can you please put those up on the flickr? I am sure that many of us would greatly benefit. I am in the process of adding OneNote into my tool set and it will be of great help to "see" the setup. Thanks.</div>

<div class="content">Greenchutney<br><br>Would be happy to.  Have been away from the forum today (Frantic Friday!) but will look at doing this over the weekend.  Before I do can you tell me how I add the blur effect as others have done on their lists as I would not really to identify tel no etc online. <br><br>Jonaz<br><br>Thanks for the link</div>

<div class="content">Christine:<br><br>You can add blur effects in different ways with different applications. Personally, I use the GIMP, which is free open source and can be downloaded here: <a href="http://www.gimp.org/windows/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gimp.org/windows/</a><br><br>After you open your image in the GIMP, select the "smudge tool" and just "paint" over the parts of the picture you want to make unreadable, then save it.<br><br>I highlighted the smudge tool in this screenshot:<br><a href="http://autofocus.cc/public/img/smudge.png" rel="nofollow">http://autofocus.cc/public/img/smudge.png</a><br><br>Regards.<br>Andreas<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Otto Fox:    I decided to do a 7 day trial of using paper only except for my calendary in digital format.     I use an A5 spiral wirebound notebook with 25 lines per page.   Already<br>I can feel the almost zero friction  of being able to quickly write something down as<br>well as to be able to quickly scan a page of 25 items.<br><br>I write my office and lunch time errands on a separate list starting in the <br>middle of the book.  <br><br>Charles</div>

<div class="content">Thank you Charles. Your comments are useful to me. I thought about using an A5 spiral wirebound notebook, because as it happens I already have a spare one, but I ended up with an A4 size notebook. It's early days yet and I'm still on the starting line anyway.</div>

<div class="content">Christine:<br><br>In addition to what I said before: If you want to blur large portions of the picture as opposed to the occasional name or phone number, it's faster to use the rectangle selection tool to select the whole area and then (for GIMP) select "Filters"->"Blur"->"Gaussian Blur" from the menu. In the following window, set the blur radius high enough so the text becomes unreadable.</div>

<div class="content">Christine:<br><br>If you try out GIMP, here's a quick tip for making screenshots with it: as you probably already know in Windows you can make screenshots to clipboard by just pressing the print key on the keyboard or alt+print if you want only the active window. Then in GIMP just select "File" -> "Create" -> "From Clipboard". If you want to save only a portion of the image, select that portion with the rectangle selection tool and click "Image" -> "Crop to Selection".<br><br>I recommend saving screenshots as PNG. Just type "filename.png" in the save dialog and GIMP will automatically save it in the right format.</div>

<div class="content">I recently switched to writing first drafts on paper rather than direct to computer as an attempt to switch off my "inner editor", which I'm told can scupper writing because it leads to the obsessive pursuit of perfection rather than production. <br><br>I mentioned to my tutor how I'm amazed at the progress I've been making with this technique and he said, "Our ancestors have been writing on surfaces since we appeared on the Earth, but only tapping keyboards for two generations. You have to work with our evolution."<br><br>So paper is def the way forward for me.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Andreas<br><br>What a great program!  I edited my files (which were in pdf) with no trouble and resaved them as jpg files (before finding your post recommending png format). What is the reason for recommending png format over jpg (I don't do vast amounts of image work so apologise if this is a stupid question!)<br><br>One more question, I couldn't quite work out how to download and install the help files -  no problem locating the online version but orange and black didn't quite do it for me :-) Could you give me a pointer on that?<br><br>Thanks again!</div>

<div class="content">little b<br><br>Very interesting comment.  Strangely I find I can think onto screen so much more easily than paper - on paper I struggle to keep up with my thoughts, my handwriting deteriorates, and messy handwriting frustrates me.  On screen I just type - then edit at a later point.  Do you think perhaps that it depends on whether our "inner editor" or our "inner perfectionist" has the stronger pull?</div>

<div class="content">Christine:<br><br>PNG and JPEG are very different formats. JPEG is "lossy", which means the JPEG picture loses quality each time it is saved, also JPEG works best with pictures like photographs that have smooth edges and many colors. PNG is "lossless", the image is not changed by the compression. PNG performs best with sharp edges and if there are large areas with the same color, which is often the case with screenshots. This is important if you create graphics for a website, but I don't think it makes a big difference for your current situation. <br><br>There is actually a problem with gimp help under Windows at the moment. You can download and install it from here:<br><br><a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/downloading.php?group_id=121075&filename=gimp-help-2-2.4.0-setup.exe&a=92708011" rel="nofollow">http://sourceforge.net/project/downloading.php?group_id=121075&filename=gimp-help-2-2.4.0-setup.exe&a=92708011</a><br><br>The problem is that for many people, the gimp help browser doesn't work in Windows. Then you will still be able to use the offline help, but it will open in your web browser. I'm afraid you'll have to get used to orange. ;-)<br><br>Now that I think about it, it should be easy to change the colors. I'll look into it. ^_^</div>

<div class="content">Christine:<br><br>Okay, after you installed the help files, download this:<br><br><a href="http://autofocus.cc/public/data/gimp-help-custom.css" rel="nofollow">http://autofocus.cc/public/data/gimp-help-custom.css</a><br><br>and save it in the folder "c:\Program Files\GIMP-2.0\share\gimp\2.0\help\en\".<br><br>That should give you a white background instead of dark grey, and light blue instead of orange. Let me know if you want different colors.<br><br>Oh, and if you didn't start the download already and want to save some time, get this instead: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/downloading.php?group_id=121075&filename=gimp-help-2-2.4.0-eng-setup.exe&a=62109267" rel="nofollow">http://sourceforge.net/project/downloading.php?group_id=121075&filename=gimp-help-2-2.4.0-eng-setup.exe&a=62109267</a><br><br>That's just the English help files, saves you 40 megabytes.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Andreas<br><br>Many thanks for your help - the help files are now installed  but do run with the web browser in orange.  I saved the custom-help file (txt file) into the en directory but it is still orange.  But that's ok - I can live with orange!<br><br>Thanks for the info on file formats. I'd read about the lossy effect of JPEG and wondered if it was to do with that but with so many formats these days ..........!  I rarely use JPEG (apart from the fact that digital photos tend to be saved automatically in that format).  I scan to PDF and the only time I have to convert to JPEG is in my Family Tree program where, although it reads PDF's, if a file has been manipulated, eg rotated, opening it in my FT program corrupts the file.  I convert all files for use with that program but there is a noticeable loss of quality.<br><br>Again many thanks for your help - it's great that you are so knowledgeable on these things!</div>

<div class="content">Mh, it shouldn't be saved as a txt-File but as "gimp-help-custom.css". Perhaps you saved it in a way that it was renamed "gimp-help-custom.css.txt"? Do you use Internet Explorer? Try saving it again and make sure you have "Save as Type" set to "All Files" and there is no .txt extension in the file name. It should work. You may be able to live with the orange, but you don't have to and I already created the file so you might as well use it. ;-)<br><br>Hope everything works out.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Andreas - yes that's fine now, thank you.  It automatically opened as a txt file but switching to All Files cured it  (after I renamed it as it automatically added (1) after the file name also!)</div>
