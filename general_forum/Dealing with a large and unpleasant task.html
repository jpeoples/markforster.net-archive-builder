<div class="content">I teach a class on creative writing and I need to read a large batch of student short stories during my winter break (a total of 43 stories!).<br>This past week, I started using "DIT" and it worked well. For each day I would put on my "Will Do" list -- "Read 6 stories."  Some days I accomplished my task. A few days I didn't make it all the way. But at the end of 5 days, I had read 26 stories.  Not bad.<br>I find that with this kind of work, I like to work in fits and starts.  I'll read five pages of a story and then I'll put it down. Twenty minutes later I'll pick it up again. Etc. Knowing that I needed to do 6 in a day (and that my list was CLOSED) really kept me in line when I was tempted to stray. (and when reading student short stories, one is ALWAYS tempted to stray).<br><br>This morning, I decided to try it with Autofocus.  On the first page of my list I wrote "Read student stories." I read one story about halfway through. That was as much as I could take.  So I stopped. Then I crossed off "read student stories" and wrote it again at the end of my list.<br>Now, I can't work on it again until I trail down through another 17 or so items on my first page.  This may take a little while and then I'll get to my next page, and once again I'll see "Read Student Stories."  At that point, maybe I'll finish the story. At which point, I'll cross it off again and the whole thing starts over.<br><br>I guess my question is this. When one has an unpleasant task which is best broken up into fits and starts -- a task which can't be finished in one sitting, but which must be worked on FREQUENTLY over the course of the same day -- how does one employ Autofocus in an effective manner?  (any teacher who has ever graded a large stack of papers or exams will know exactly the kind of task I mean).<br>Or is the discipline of DIT more effective for such unpleasant tasks?</div>

<div class="content">Steve, that's an interesting dilemma. I don't know what Mark will say, but I think if you have a method for tackling a task that works for you (Read 6 stories a day), keep it. Use AF for the rest. If you really like using your AF lists as I do, you might tell yourself that you must read your six stories before working on your lists or you can schedule them for a certain time. One thing I would do regardless is reward yourself for reading the allotted stories!  Good luck!</div>

<div class="content">This might not be the "right" way to do it, but I've chosen not to cross off a task like that until the end of the day.  I keep coming back to it, in amongst doing other tasks on the list, and then cross it off when I've finished work on it for the day.<br><br>In my case, the task was to study a chapter of material I needed to learn.  It was the main task of the day and was going to go on all day, on and off. I'm useless at concentrating on something like that these days, so I worked on it in blocks (I must try formal time-boxing on it).  It seemed pointless to cross it off and re-enter it when I was going to come back to it so soon.<br></div>

<div class="content">Steve:<br><br>I note that the 43 stories you have to read are not time specific except that you have to read them during your winter break. The aim to read 6 stories a day is your own way of tackling the task, but not necessarily the only way to do it.<br><br>That actually gives you a lot of flexibility using the Autofocus method. In the example you gave you had another 17 pages to trawl through before getting to the re-entered item. But when you do get to it the number of pages to the next re-entry will probably be considerably less. And when you re-enter it for the third time  it may only be on the next page.<br><br>If you can get away from the idea that you must do a regular 6 stories a day, I think you will find the system will cope perfectly well with the project in the overall time allowed.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks everyone for their feedback. I came up with a solution yesterday that seems to work very well (at least it did yesterday).  <br><br>What I did was this:<br><br>I made up a new list and on each page I entered individual stories as separate tasks.  So, instead of writing <br><br>"Read Six Student Stories"<br><br>I wrote, instead,<br><br>Read Joe's Story<br>Read Dan's story<br>Read Louise's story<br>Read Dave's story <br><br>etc.<br><br>The result was that each page of my list contained many options.  On each page there were a number of stories to choose from, as well as a number of other tasks which I could choose to do.<br>This feeling of variety served me well. <br><br>I would go down the list and pick a story to read.   I would work as long as I wanted reading the story - and if I got fed up with the story, I would cross it off and put it at the end of the list.  I could allow myself to do this, because I could then pick another story to read (right on the same page) and I could come back to the first story later.  <br>Knowing I could do this (stop reading  a story, and finish it later),  made it easier NOT to do it  (if that makes any sense).<br><br>I easily made my daily quote of reading 6 stories using this method.<br><br>For me, it was an Autofocus epiphany.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Mark. <br>Right now it's early afternoon -- I'm no more than halfway through my day of work -- and I've already had a chance to read 3 student stories, and work on several other things as well. <br>Autofocus is really quite something!</div>

<div class="content">Steve, your solution is what I have also found very workable with AF. In my opinion it is a lot easier to get moving with these large and unpleasant tasks with AF than DIT, because the method inherently supports the principle of little and often.<br><br>With AF I have found it to be a lot easier to break tasks into smaller parts than in DIT. In many larger tasks it is easier to see how to break tasks once you have actually started doing it, not before. With DIT these new items would be put scheduled to the next day while with AF you can continue with them later the same day if you like.<br><br>Also in DIT, when you break task into several small steps you would still probably see all the steps together on your list leading you to be overwhelmed by the size of the whole task. In AF, however, the tasks are truly separated which decreases resistance.</div>

<div class="content">That's a very interesting observation Niko!  I've never felt it to be difficult to break down my projects into parts but I can see that AF has in fact made it easier, regardless of whether it is prompted by the need to progress a task in stages or just as part of a normal planning phase.<br><br>I suspect that it is due to the fact that my mind does feel more free and my creativity levels have increased.  Interesting ...........</div>

<div class="content">Having reread my post, I would like to elaborate on my last point: <br><br>"In DIT, when you break task into several small steps you would still probably see all the steps together on your list leading you to be overwhelmed by the size of the whole task." This is because you know that you have to action all these items on the same day. So even if a large task is divided into smaller pieces, you still know you have to do something to all of them before you are finished for the day and your mind still sees the whole effort required.<br><br>While in AF there are no specific tasks you have to do in any day, unless there is a task you really know you have to do. You feel only resistance towards the item you are currently processing.</div>
