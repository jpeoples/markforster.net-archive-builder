<div class="content">So far I'm finding the Autofocus system really helpful &, indeed, enjoyable.  I've always been aware, without really analysing it, that the comparative difficulty of a task is not an objective thing, or not only objective, but depends on all sorts of other factors, such as mood, health, (in)digestion, weather etc.  Some days the thought of e.g. making a phone call can feel like an enormous obstacle, & thinking about it, worrying about it, imagining all the things that could go wrong with it, can cast a blight not only over the feared task but over everything else in the day as well.  And then on the next day, somehow the internal clouds have lifted & one just picks up the phone & does it.  So I've become aware that beating oneself up about a particular task that doesn't absolutely have to be done this instant can be counter-productive, & hiding behind that awareness is the sense that these inner compulsions could actually be used positively.  And that's what the Autofocus system sets out to do & which I find works - it 'marries' the tasks which need to be done with the right psychic space in which to do them, helping you to 'go with the flow'.</div>

<div class="content">Virginia, I do so agree with you!  Last week I wrote half an essay which was long overdue and put together three quarters of a stained glass window.  I didn't clean the bathrooms or change the beds (at all, all week!).  And I forgot to eat last night. But somehow because all those things are still on my list I know I will get them done when I come over all housewifely again.  (Must go and clean the litter tray!)</div>
