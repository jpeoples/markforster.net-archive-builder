<div class="content">I have a question related to DIT. I understand that according to Mark projects fall into three categories, never ending, no deadline, and deadline driven. And I also know that he says that never ending projects should be given a specific time slot each day, no deadline projects should be taken on one at a time as a current initiative, while deadline driven projects flow as tasks into the "one-off tasks" bucket each day. <br><br>My question is how do you handle multiple deadline driven projects in DIT? Do you only work on one at a time or do a little bit of each outstanding project each day, etc?<br><br>Any help would be appreciated.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Philip, I have been working with DIT successfully for over a year. I would say it is best to make a start the deadlined project as soon as you get it and then work away at it with the principle of 'little and often' that Mark suggests. <br><br>This means that you may be working on several deadline driven projects during the course of the day, maybe only for 20 minutes or so, depending on what needs doing. I often find that projects go into a quiet phase (usually when I have put the ball back in the other person's court) - so then I schedule a chase up review date in my task diary. At this point the project may pick up again. <br><br>Also, I don't bother with a 'projects list' as such anymore - I use my Task Diary to keep them current by planning in work on them and review dates. <br><br></div>
