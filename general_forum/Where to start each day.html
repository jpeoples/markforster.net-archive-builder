<div class="content">I understand that each day I should start my AF list where I left it the last time I was working.  Am I the only one finding it hard to remember where I was up to in all the pages?  What systems to people have for knowing where to continue from?  And do you do the first scan on the page you were on the day before or start with scanning the next page?  I ask this because, although I know it 's not quite how it should work, I do seem to get bogged down in one page for days at a time.  Thanks.</div>

<div class="content">This raises an interesting question.<br><br>Do you complete your current task at the end of the day?<br><br>If not, the "committed dot" tells you where you are - there is only ever one incomplete task with a "committed dot". A bookmark helps significantly!<br><br>On an electronic system it's relatively straightforward: using your "current task" marker, you mark the next task when you close for the day, and clear it the next morning.<br><br>But you really should be doing multiple passes every day. If you're getting stuck on a single page, something is seriously wrong. So you should be able to restart at the beginning each day. It might be worth walling off an hour or two where you consciously limit the time you allow yourself for each task (to 5 or ten minutes, say).<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">I write the date completed by each item, so for today, I just have to look and see where the last Feb. 26 is.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Lesley<br><br>I certainly don't get the opportunity to move through all pages every day (although as Will says, it is good if you can).  However once you get past say 15 active pages it becomes more difficult to pass through quickly.  At the end of the day I really feel that you intuitively know if the speed is "right" for you, and Mark has given some tips as to how to "adjust" the speed in other posts.<br><br>Personally I use a paperclip to mark the page I am working on and I always start the day with the page I was working on the day before.  If nothing else stands out I move on.<br><br>The FAQ post may give you a few more ideas<br><a href="../general_forum/FAQ's - Update 1.html" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/645945</a></div>

<div class="content">I use little Post It Notes as tabs. So I have one of one color on the current active page, and one of another color on the last page, which makes flipping to the end and adding new stuff easy. And moving a Post It tab is also easy. You just pull up the tab, flip the notebook page, and slap the tab back down. (Neatly, of course.)<br><br>I actually got the idea while I was moving the paperclip I was using as a bookmark. There were some small Post It pads lying on the table next to me. I looked at them and thought, "Hey!" And I felt very clever about my idea. Even though it's a good bet I probably read about someone doing something similar at some point.  : )</div>
