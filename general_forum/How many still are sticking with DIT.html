<div class="content">David, I've never actually tried DIT, but based on posts I think that I will! I can't imagine that there is ANY "one size fits all" system that will work for everyone. We are all unique and I think "customization" of ANY system (of any kind! not just time management) makes sense.</div>

<div class="content">Hi David<br>When 5pm hits, I go back over my day with autofocus and use my regular system to plug up the important holes!  LOL!  But, I want to stick with giving an honest attempt at learning autofocus a fair trial if for no other reason than to feel confident with my final analysis and resultant conclusions drawn.  <br>But, I must emphatically state that I'm not a DIT purist.  I've always stuck with a few of GTD's principles and procedures.  I really like the results of marrying aspects of both systems.<br>psssssttttt.......After reading your earlier post, I'm relieved that today is the tail end of Thursday.....I'm growing a bit weary of having to backtrack my steps each day after using Autofocus!  *blush*  My experience of it seems as though I'm working randomly off a huge master list with no guidance system to direct my efforts in a forward direction (i.e.  Am I properly meeting my responsibilities and obligations?  Am I advancing my goals?  etc )nor any easy way to measure my actual productivity and progress.....and...whether I'm actually moving forward on the important things or being sidetracked by more trivial matters by comparison simply because they appear on a certain page that was randomly created by the most part.  I also don't like the idea of little and often as being the superior method to hunkering down on a project for a decent period of time (or an indecent one if it's moving along fantastically!  *blush)  I guess I'd rather be offering excuses for occasional ' done good enough" trivial tasks while feeling great about getting the important stuff done well!  For some reason, it's always been like that....even as a child!  LOL!  But with autofocus, I felt trepidation.....I didn't know what was the best use of my time at each moment.  Important endeavors aren't always supposed to be trumped by the one next due, yeah?<br>learning as I go<br>p.s.  Has anybody else folded in a bit of GTD into their DIT system?</div>

<div class="content">I still stick with DIT. For me the ability to keep track of contacts and ideas and processes over time is really invaluable. My task diary contains a copy of my calendar as well. At a glance I can see how much time I have available for desk work. I keep a bunch of index cards with those things that are not readily found in the task diary, i.e. long term project lists, repeating tasks and such.<br><br>To be honest, I have yet to give AF a thorough tryout, but since I am quite happy as it is and I don't really see how autofocus will help me track time related issues, I don't really see the point.<br><br>For example: tomorrow I am leaving for a week of skiing. I already know about a couple of calls I need to make and several things I need to follow up on, once I get back in a weeks time. On that particuar page of my task diary all these things are already listed, so I basically have most of my first day back in the office already planned out. I don't really see how AF would be able to accomplish this feat and act as a potent reminder.<br><br>Maybe I am missing something, but in my own opinion DIT is the better structural tool.<br><br>Klaus</div>

<div class="content">Bev is correct. IMHO, there is no one size fits all system. In fact, even for the same person one system works well in certain circumstance and another works better in other times. It also depends on the mental makeup of the person. <br><br>For example, in my case, I use both AF and DIT. I really like AF and use it most of the time to move forward on multiple fronts. I have found that "Little & often" gives me small victories that add up to big victories over time. However, there are times when I use DIT exclusively. I use AF list as a sort of master list and DIT items come from this list. When I have a largish project with tight deadlines, I tend to use DIT. On all the other situations, I am very happy with AF.<br><br>Interestingly, (for me) I have found that AF works best when I am more or less in control. And, the higher the influence of external circumstances, the less effective AF becomes - unless I can seize control at some point. So, as long as I have a certain degree of freedom to choose what I need to do, AF works great. If this is universally true (and that's a big IF), then each person will probably fall somewhere along this spectrum.<br><br>As a side note, this awareness has helped me significantly to influence some of my own circumstances. While I don't think I can eliminate all the external pressures, I do think I can minimize them if I am vigilant enough. <br></div>

<div class="content">I'm definitely sticking with DIT as I prefer the structure of it and felt overwhelmed and behind with AF. I switched back to DIT from AF at the beginning of this week and noticed how many time sensitive tasks had started to slip - I am now dealing with these as a Backlog and am almost back up to date. I also feel less tired and feel calmer and more in control of my day. <br><br>Learning as I go: I am considering using a project list as in GTD just as a way of reviewing my current commitments and keeping them fresh. I could then a) schedule reviews of individual projects at appropriate intervals and / or review all my projects or the projects list on a weekly basis. What do you (and others) do and what advice would you give? Thanks.</div>

<div class="content">Have been daydreaming  lately about integrating Autofocus into my GTD/DIT hybrid system because of the abundance of creativity and thoughts AF has brought into my work. <br><br>The system would consist of three parts.<br><br>First there could be a time-driven part consisting of a calendar, a task diary and some kind of hold-file system (e.g. tickler file or writing on-hold-items in the diary). The diary would only contain several weeks to keep it managable.<br><br>Second there would be a list of projects, responsibilities, duties, roles, etc (the work program) with additional working plans for each item on this work program list.<br><br>Third there would be an Autofocus list for capturing all kinds of input from papers or thoughts, working on that input, making decisions and distributing the work either to the calendar-diary-thing or to the projects-planning-thing or letting it stay on the AF list to be further worked on there.<br><br>Items that are too time-sensitive would go into the calendar-diary direction.<br>Items that were dismissed from the AF list but still have to be done would become  items on the work-program-list with the need for planning.<br>The planning-task itself would either go into the diary or the AF list. <br><br>The weekly review would keep all this tied together and updated.<br>The weekly review itself would be a task either in the diary or the calendar. <br><br>Right now it's just a daydream. What would you say? Too chaotic?<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi everyone,<br>I'm a fan of AF - and of DIT and of GTD.  They all have gems of wisdom and powerful techniques, most of which are complementary, but it seems to me that we need to blend the best bits (for us) together in a way which fits for our particular style, and the nature of our work.<br><br>I use AF both at home and work, and I find it works differently in each context.  At home AF suits well - when I have some free time and want to get on with things.  But at work the AF list needs to sit alongside calendar commitments, daily essentials and imminent deadlines when I am choosing what to spend time on.   <br><br>For what it's worth, my work system is to have a must-do list for the day, which has the essentials and regular stuff, plus any same-day urgent tasks.  And I keep a list of major tasks with due dates this week or next week alongside the AF list (a bit like the index card some people use) to make sure I don't lose track and get caught out on deadlines.  In the background I have a master project list, and project notes, and I also keep agenda lists of things to discuss with different people/ groups.  In reality I often have to revert to the 'common sense' mode to do things when they need to be done or can most efficiently be done.  <br><br>The real benefit of AF for me even if used in this way is that it encourages just getting started and working on things little and often - by helping us phrase things in do-able chunks.<br><br>On the other hand, the downside is that this forum is very addictive!  I'm not sure yet if it feeds our procrastination, or is motivational and educational in our quests to be more productive!<br><br>Looking forward to hearing more views on the hybrid approach!<br><br>(Rainer just seen your post as I previewed mine!  Your idea sounds like you're thinking along the same lines as me.  I'll look out for your next iteration - daydream on!)</div>

<div class="content">I am still participating in the AF beta test, but am highly likely to go back to DIT, or a DIT/AF hybrid in which any backlog from DIT is process by AF.  <br><br>The short way to say it is simple: I am getting more done with AF but I felt better at many levels (physical, psychological) with DIT.</div>

<div class="content">Rainer, no disrespect intended, but your proposed system does look a little complicated - at least for my purposes, which I guess might result in spending a disproportianate amount of time in running the system to actioning tasks. But, good luck and I admire your creativity.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-02-27 12:23</div>
<div class="content">Leon, <br>thanks for your comment.<br><br>Yes, my proposed systems sounds complicated. OTOH, all of the three parts already exit: that projects-planning-thing  from my usage of GTD, the calendar-diary-thing from my times using DIT, and the AF list(s) from the beta test phase. And all of them are in use to some limited extent.<br><br>The key to know whether this system would be feasible is the amount of time it takes to do the weekly review. My last several weekly reviews took 3 to 4 hours each. That's far to much and not sustainable/maintainable. My aim is to reduce the time for the weekly review down to 60 minutes at maximum. <br><br>So I need to see which activities have to stay as part of the system maintenance (the weekly review) and what has to be part of the normal work day, e.g. emptying my paper in-tray in to my system (GTD-type "processing") would be a no-go for the weekly review. Or, planning shouldn't be a part of the weekly review, too, it should be part of the normal work, and the reminder for the planning task would be either in the diary or the AF list.<br><br>Well, time will tell.<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Leon<br>Yes, I, too, use my projects list to both track and plan.  I also keep a queque of "possible" new projectsto bring to life as a slot opens up.(DA's Someday/Maybe list.  I tagged it my Possibilities List only because it triggers more excitement and optimism. *blush*)   I also feel more in control with my agenda list and follow up list,which is referenced on my checklist..<br> Because of my "situation", I also love checklists and my two contexts lists are 1)groceries/sundries and 2) supplies (a catch-all phrase for project supplies as oppposed to carrots or toilet paper!  LOL!)<br>I live very much according to both my review process and also by how life itself and the ebb and flow of my capabilities present themselves.....very akin to listening to the weather resport as a factor in planning the day!  LOL!  (I pretty much have to do what I can with what my brain and body allow.  If I'm writhing in pain or heavily doped up, I'll defer previously planned events that require higher levels of thinking.  I humorously regard these times a scutwork time!  LOL!  Even through high levels of pain, I can mop the floor or toss in a load of laundry.  Usually I hate scutwork....but in hard pain, I'm glad to have chores I'm capable of doing!  LOL!  Conversely, if I'm more up to par......I don't even consider these chores at all!  *blush*  I go right to my projects or other tasks that require higher levels of focus and thinking.   I both love and need structure AND flexibility. This balance allows me to stay current, move ahead and simply enjoy the best quality of life I can muster for both me and important others in my life.  That's my meta-goal.<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Hi Rainier<br>I, too, rely heavily on my weekly, monthly, seasonal and yearly reviews to create scaffolding for actions and measuring them against my responsibilities and aims.  It usually only takes about 30 to 45 minutes as it's mostly scaffolding.  I allow myself to further granularize (is that a word?) it as part of my actual work.  i.e.  When I've timeboxed a time for a project and/or during the time I'm building my schedule.  For my needs, once the scaffolding is looselly in place, I'm good to go!  Scheduling or inspiration will allow me to flesh out the details.<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Hi all<br>Am I daft or do you all feel like the autofocus list is actually the master list?  (with subsets for some of us).....<br>Of course I appreciate the need and benefit of this.  I just didn't like the autofocus method of doing work according to what page it randomly landed on (brain dump or adding to it as you think of it) or using structured procrastination....I'll do this because it's juxtaposed to that.....or I'll do something so that other items won't get dismissed.  Maybe if my capabilities weren't so unpredictable, I might enjoy the fun of it.  I'd rather use this list as part of review process or cull work from it only when I've finished what I've set out to do.  Even then, I'd mostly likely refer to my calendar or projects list (or skim a particular project plan file) or possibly my checklist to knock more out.  I don't ever remember going to my master list to choose the next thing to do during the workday itself.......but it does sound like fun.....Still, if I want fun, it won't likely be on my master list!  <br>learning as I go</div>

It seems to be that the act of "trusting the system" is what enables us to take back control but sometimes you just have to catch what's been thrown at you rather than let it knock you over!  <br><br>I think that the awareness you reference is a very material factor in AF - if we choose to take the actions revealed by AF to influence our existing circumstances that will indeed go a long way towards minimising the effects of those external pressures, which let's face it, are always going to happen as part of normal life.<br></div>
