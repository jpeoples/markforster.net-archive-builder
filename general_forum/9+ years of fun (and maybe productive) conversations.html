<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2019-02-14 15:00</div>
<div class="content">For whatever reason today, I was pondering how I first got acquainted with Mark's books, newsletter, blog, etc. I subscribed to his newsletter from the old Yahoo days, so I've been acquainted with his work and advice for at least that long.<br><br>But shortly after Mark's retirement, he posted here about a new system he was developing that would give him "auto-focus" on his tasks: <a href="../blog/Future Developments.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2008/12/18/future-developments.html</a> .<br><br>It struck me today that his development of Autofocus -- 9 years ago! -- coincided with an explosion of creativity and chat on this discussion forum that is to me unparalleled in my internet travels. It was always a good forum before, but dang, this site is now one of my daily stops.<br><br>And seeing all the crowdsource-y ways people are using their creativity to develop their own systems that draw from or react to or build off of so many of Mark's innovations that start with a simple pen and paper format -- well, it just boggles my mind. Software is great, but I can do more with these ideas than what any software could give me.<br><br>We praise this forum and its host often, but today I was overwhelmed by HOW MUCH GOOD STUFF is on this site and wanted to acknowledge that. I shall mark my gratitude with a healthy libation at this evening's happy hour.<br><br>Thank you, Mark Forster!</div>

<div class="content">Definitely a milestone worth celebrating!  It's a real blast from the past reading that first Autofocus thread.  In fact, a few days ago I went into the Archives section to read the oldest post on the forum (sometime in 2006 as I recall) - the archived posts are a goldmine. <br><br>Congratulations Mark!</div>

<div class="content">Mark, thanks for the urls. I'm not sure one space will work for me. You posted your URL while being logged in. As a guest, I just had this comment blocked even by just having "markforster. squarespace. com" (without the space) in the text, no http and all.</div>

<div class="content">Andreas: You are a dark genius! <br><br>I remembered introducing The No S Diet to this forum, but I had absolutely no memory of that Superfocus post. My god, how I can bloviate. I remember posting responses to some threads with my post being the very last one, so I think I have also killed some threads in my time :)<br><br>Kind of weird seeing how much of a footprint one has left on that great big copy machine that is the internet.<br><br>I'd love to see an ebook of Seraphim posts, Alan posts, Bernie posts, nuntym posts, Cricket posts, Andreas posts, etc -- "Getting Things Done: The Autofocus Years" --  there's an incredible amount of smarts in this neighborhood.</div>

<div class="content">Like many of you, this is one of the rare blog/sites that I consistently revisit. A lot of the time it's to see what Mark is up to vis--a-vis a new system or tool. His thinking and ingenuity in this space is unmatched, in my opinion.</div>
