<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-06-14 13:56</div>
<div class="content">I know this has been discussed ad naseum in the past, but I wanted to bring this up again as it has become a critical item for me.  I am using Autofocus 1 with great success.  For project management, I have been doing two things: (1) Adding specific tasks to the list and (2) Adding statements lilke "work on project X".  Both work well.  But my question has to do with how to manage multiple projects at the same time.  I have created a timeline with target dates as to when projects will be completed, but it still seems as if I am missing something that would allow things to progress more smoothly.<br><br>I seem to remember back in DIT that Mark had said that it is best if one does non-continuous projects one at a time, and therefore one can sequence things more easily.  But in our 2010 world, it is not reasonable for me to only work on one project at a time.  Everyone wants to know when certain projects will be completed, and frequent status updates on where things are.  Using AF, it is difficult sometimes to see where I am with things in this regard.  <br><br>So my question to Mark and All is what is the best way to manage multiple projects if one uses AF?  Some projects can be sequenced, but many have to be worked on in a parallel fashion.<br><br>Best wishes,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">David:<br><br>I think what I actually said is that it's best to get projects up and running one at a time. Once they are up and running then of course you have to work on them simultaneously.<br><br>My advice on this subject has been pretty consistent. If a project is complex enough to require management documentation then you should keep that documentation as part of the project (i.e. not as part of AF). Similarly if you require to be able to see the status of all projects at once then providing some means of tracking this should be seen as a task, and not as part of the AF system.<br><br>In other words these project management tasks (or sub-tasks) are treated like any other task in AF system, rather than being part of the AF system itself.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>Thanks for clarifying your stance on projects and AF -- this was very helpful!<br><br>Do you have any suggestions as to how to track multiple projects?  I have seen Excel spreadsheets done by some, and of course, there are several project management software packages available.  It is hard to see what would work the best.  I guess I could search online and see, but it doesn't hurt to ask.  :)<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="meta">2010-06-14 15:09</div>
<div class="content">David:<br><br>I think it depends on the complexity of the project. I've been able to keep track of most of mine on a simple Word document - Excel would certainly work just as well if not better.<br><br>On the other hand for something really complex involving co-ordinating the activities of a multitude of people then project management software would no doubt be useful. <br><br>But people in the past managed to build bridges, design airplanes and conduct WW2 without any of these goodies, so they are probably not essential!</div>

<div class="content">It also makes a big difference who wants to see progress and how.  If you're the only one that really needs the details, manage on your computer with any app.    But if you need to share work and share progress, then those details will direct an appropriate solution.  I can think of a dozen possibilities but it all depends on context which possibility is a good idea.</div>

<div class="content">I use a kanban board for projects where we have special workflows (software development). It's perfect if you need to see at a glance what is in work (WIP = work in progress) at which step and what tasks are waiting to be processed next (= backlog). <br><br>You can try a free version of a virtual kanban board here:<br><a href="http://www.leankitkanban.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.leankitkanban.com</a><br><br>Look under "Features" for pictures of example kanban boards and their workflows. You can create them very easily. There are also pictures with more than 1 project in parallel  (=> horizontal swim lanes).<br><br>Here is another interesting link for personal kanban <br><a href="http://personalkanban.com/personal-kanban-101/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://personalkanban.com/personal-kanban-101/</a></div>

<div class="content">I have never seen the Kanban before.  It looks like a really simple and interesting tool for both project management and time management.  It looks like it would work well in an office setting, where you can refer to it through out the day.  It could also provide a reminder of recurring tasks.  If you used small enough post-its, you may be able to do one in a notebook as well <br><br>Thanks for pointing it out.<br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div>

<div class="content">Holy Cow<br>This is the 21st century edition to my system my dad taught me in the mid 1950's.   It's WONDERFUL for the visual aide of Overview/Planning/Execution.  We used index cards, blackboard and scheduler.  Now a days I created a sheet metal board (magnetic) with acrylic overlay on a portion to mindmap the initial processing stages to accomplish my goals....sculpures, classes/practice to mastery for competitions, term papers, etc.  Then I'd schedule the steps.  THIS COMPUTER PROGRAM IS WONDERFUL!!!!!  I would never trash my board and index cards and whiteboard pens because of brain injuries......but this pc version might prove to both expedite and enhance the entire process.  <br>THANK YOU!  If my Dad was living, he'd be over the moon seeing this software version!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>For those of you reading the procrastination thread, you might find this KanBan idea IMMENSELY helpful.  As a child, I had index cards for values, passions and goals.  I'd create my schedule based on this.  The values (especially the desired character traits and needs categories and responsibilities) were rearranged contextually according to my time, responsibilities and passions/goals to help me build my schedule.  <br>When I'd hedge on doing something unpleasant or anxiety provoking, my dad taught me to remember the VALUE I was supporting by doing it....i.e.  the WHY of it.  Also, the tracking of progress kept me optimistic to start and keep on track.  Over the years it got to the point that I could "see" my board in my mind.  If not, I'd go to my bedroom and look at the WHAT, HOW and WHY board.  I STILL need to do this mind game to keep me on point!  LOL!<br>My other aide is a timer.  I set the time based on the anxiety level I'm feeling.  I just keep on this way until either the task is done or I'm completed the timebox encompassing a series of tasks on a project.  True, I admit to grunting, but it does the trick.  I just keep reitterating the WHY of it.  Sometimes, I'll even write it down as a satellite reminder.  It doesn't necessarily make doing it easier, but it always works to get/stay working to the predetermined stage of completion. When I'm lucky, a flow state will take over the initial resistance.....then I ride the wave.....<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Hi Stephen<br>Thank you for the great example!  This leankitkanban is FANTASTIC!  I've been monkeying around with it.  It's also SO FLEXIBLE!  Your example is really great!  This would also be a great virtues and habit builder for children.  Heck, even we adults are always improving/adding habits.  Your board has a lane for this!  I suppose that you can infer that I'm primarily a top down planner.  Your board supports both top down and bottom up planning and execution. (just as real life both encourages and demands of us)  I am truly AMAZED over this!!!  It is both faster and easier than my prehistoric methods...although I'll need to keep the board to help me with my brain injures. I believe that both will work well in tandem.<br>Again, thanks Stevphen!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the information about Kanban - I'd never heard of it before.  <br><br>The LeanKit software looks good, but at the moment I'm trying AgileZen (<a href="http://agilezen.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://agilezen.com</a> ).  It's a simpler tool with fewer features, but I like its simplicity and I think it might work well for me.  I really like the idea of moving things across the screen as you work on them and complete them.  I've just completed my first two "stories", as AgileZen calls them, each containing several tasks, and it's very satisfying to watch them move into the Complete area.  The Working area gives me focus, allowing me to pick one or two stories from each area of my life and work on it over a period of time until it's done, instead of trying to work on too many disparate things at once and feeling overwhelmed.<br><br>This might be what I've been looking for as a kind of "back-end" to AF1, planning projects and generating tasks to go onto my AF list.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Alan<br>LOL!  No, dad wasn't ahead of his time at all.  We neanderthals have discovered that the "timeless knowledge" simpley gets recycled and "repackaged" as novel so that someone can make money or become a guru!  That said, new techology has always boggled my brain.  It's so fascinating!  When I was that age, computers were the size of buildings!  I wouldn't mind living a thousand more years. Life itself, especially the progress of mankind, keeps me enthralled despite the boredom and tribulations I need to dance around to get to the good stuff progress gifts us with!  *blush*  I won't even start about my love affair with the timeline of the arts or social progress....<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Hi Annette, a nice description of AgileZen, and yes, its simplicity is enticing.<br><br>I hoped I would be able to stay manual for some time, but AZ and LK seem to have a manual feel about it, even if it is dragging cards around.<br><br>I look forward to hearing how you and Alan get along with it, but in the meantime annual draft accounts beckon.  I like the capability of editing and reusing cards, ideal for the 'next task' in a process stream, I can see it now:<br><br>Instead of showing 'Complete credit card transactions' in the Completed or Archive lane, I could edit it 'Process reconciliations' and put in into Backlog or Ready.

<div class="content">An interesting idea about setting priorities in a kanban (the article applies more to teams, but the idea can be just as well used for your personal kanban board).<br><br>I use it to structure the backlog => what to pull next, if capacity is free.<br><br><a href="http://leansoftwareengineering.com/2008/08/19/priority-filter/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://leansoftwareengineering.com/2008/08/19/priority-filter/</a><br><br>The article's priority definitions are like this:<br><br>  1. An item which we are currently working on or intend to work on immediately, strictly limited by our currently available capacity<br>  2. An item which we should work on as soon as possible, but for which we do not have immediate capacity<br>  3. An item which we should work on soon, but is not immediately pressing</div>

<div class="content">... oops I forgot. Further down the article from my previous post you find this (reminds me of DWM) :<br>___<br>One more element is needed to make this viable as a prioritization scheme. It might be possible for a ticket to languish in the lower priority states without ever being selected for promotion. To prevent this, new tickets should be given an expiration date. When tasks in one priority bucket are compared in consideration for promotion, aging tickets should be given preferential consideration. Old tickets deserve either immediate promotion or reconsideration, but should not be allowed to languish in a buffer indefinitely.</div>

<div class="content">Recently, I discovered that my reason for looking for a time management method has not been in synch with they main reasons people seem to have. After going to a number of communities and systems/methods, it seems most people look for a way to alleviate procrastination. This has never been my problem. I don't procrastinate. So most of the systems don't work for me because they are centered on that. I used and tried the systems without looking at my real needs if you will.<br><br>My biggest problem has been to make sure that I manage the amount of work that I can do and commit to, so that is where the Kanban looked so appealing to me. I have "understood" recently that Project Management, Time Management and Life Balance are 3 separate discipline for three different phenomenons that have 3 different natures.<br><br>Project Management -> Make things Grows (like a Plant)<br>Time Management -> Make things Flow (like a River)<br>Life Balance -> Create a Balance of Energies (like Nature itself)<br><br>So the way I see things now is that you will have projects that come from desires but they have to be filtered down a layer of life balance to make sure it is sustainable and finally, since the only thing we cannot control is time, then we have to control the flow of the things we do at which time. That is my quest/Holy Grail and I find that a lot of systems account for everything but not Life Balance.<br><br>I found that for me, I have 3 types of energies that drive me forward:<br>Physical<br>Mental<br>Spiritual (nerves/stress/courage)<br><br>I often tried to plan my day but through it all, I let some stuff go because of a lack of energy of the required type. So my goal is to manage my energy levels so that I can accomplish what I want to accomplish. For that I use a big mixture that seems very complicated from the outside but is really simple and intuitive FOR ME when I actually use it.<br><br>I'll develop more on this if people seem to have any interest in the subject :)</div>

<div class="content">It seems to me autofocus is good at balancing your life, if you let it. If this doesn't work for you, do tell why. There's also an app out there that happens to be called LifeBalance. Not so good for AF because it sorts and prioritizes your tasks for you. Otherwise it's an interesting approach to balance. And they have an interesting blog too. Focused on living and llamas.</div>
<h2>Reply by Erik</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-06-22 8:20</div>
<div class="content">I have seen LifeBalance and I don't fancy it exactly for the reason you said.<br><br>As for AF, you are spot on in saying that it does include Life Balance and that is why I discovered that that was what I was lacking. AF is great for balancing using the intuitive and reasoning parts of yourself. But it does not help me identify the fact that I'm taking too much of one kind of commitment.<br><br>I really love the simplicity, the ergonomics and the usability of AF; it's the best system I have seen so far to just do what is most important to you. But there is just something about lists that don't let me SEE what's happening and where I'm loosing on myself. For example, I'm a workaholic and it does not help me get the rest that I need to fully utilize my energy on worthwhile projects. Since I like a certain kind of thing, I'll do only that kind of stuff from the good to the bad just to continue, like candy. But we all need our veggies right? In diminishing the amount of one kind of activity you do, you automatically start to choose the ones that give you the most return on it... or in other words, the ones most important for you.<br><br>So what I did was this (I'm not going into the details):<br>First I did a LOOSE budgeting of my time. Let's take a setup where everyday is the same (no weekends) just to make understanding this simpler. I have taken into account the usual time it takes me to do the routine stuff, i.e: brush teeth, eat, take a bath and sleep. Which makes sure that I don't over-push the expectation of my engagements for the day. I noticed that I'm left with 12.5 hours to be active.<br><br>I decided to break that time in usable chunks: "Pomodoros" :)<br>With breaks in, it leaves me with 20 Pomodoros for a day but that includes everything.<br>I budgeted those pomodoros in things like Fun&Entertainment, Maintenance, Health&Exercise, etc... That part is my life balance thing. I can review and change it if I feel crappy one day or see things differently this month.<br><br>Then I made a simple Kanban that pulls work, recreation, maintenance, exercise, etc... into the done column on the right. The budget there is the DONE column with a WIP for each type of activity. So for exemple, I can do maintenance only 4 blocks per day and I have to do 2 blocks of entertainment.<br><br>Then I start pulling in stuff in the flow. When I finish a block of work for example, I gage my energies and then choose a block that will let me use my strength of the moment and let my previously used energy recover.<br><br>(The kanban is in a notebook and I use transparent post-its with a color end. Each color is assigned a type of activity like Fun&Entertainment)<br><br>On the left of the kanban is the stuff that needs to be done or that I want to do at one point or another. So I start pulling as I feel it, all the while balancing the types of activities that I process. After a couple of days, I can instantly see if one kind of activity is filling in too much, like maintenance for instance, on the left which means that I'm taking too many engagements of that kinds and that I should do something about it.<br><br>The great thing is that, I don't feel guilty for not doing the stuff in the backlog because I always fill my 20 allocated pomodoros which means I did a good balanced day. I have a sense of completion which AF did not give me but DIT did. I SEE what my system can handle and I use my intuition on the type of work to do next.<br><br>Projects are just another block that once you did some stuff on it that day, you can put back in the backlog for the next day. You can out stretch any budgeted limit but at least you'll see it at the end of the day and I was VERY surprised to find out that I put way too much energy on Health and Exercise (And I'm the kind of guy that hates that kind of activity!!!).<br><br>Not to make a longer read, I'll leave it at that for now.<br>If you have any questions or comments, please let me know!</div>

<div class="content">Erik, keep going with your feedback!<br><br>This has been one of the best threads I've seen on the forum, if only because I have more project-oriented work in my 13 month assignment in Damascus, Syria.<br><br>I like the idea of the personal kanban in a notebook, would suit my nomadic/peripatetic life.  As I'm back home in the UK for this week, I'll have a look at the small post-it stickers at a local stationery shop.  I would think na A4/extra large Moleskine  would be the best size, perhaps with squared paper.  <br><br>An alternative might be a loose A3 sheet (folded in half inside a plastic folder for protection in my work backpack) which I could then put up on the nearest suitable wall in an office or apartment location with a bit of Blutac/adhesive putty.<br><br>While in creative mode, I realise one can create a kanban in Excel, have Post-It - like cells of varying sizes and colours (plus use the Comment feature in Excel for more detailed notes/comments for an individual note).  This can then be printed out and displayed as required, or remain in electronic format.<br><br>I get a BNet email newsletter a few times a day, the uninteresting newsletters are deleted, the interesting links kept for looking at.  There's been one on To Do Lists with a poll.  I'm still one of the 29% majority using pen and paper.<br><br>Till then, more contributions to this thread, please (thanks for creating it, David)</div>

<div class="content">I really REALLY like the idea of personal kanban.  I think it is because it is so visual. My only issue really is that I would have rather a lot on my backlog which I would have to think about.  I work at home most of the time so a whiteboard application may suit me better (plenty of space) using different colours and shapes for different topics / projects / customers.  Only thing is that it does become less portable on a whiteboard.<br><br>I am interested in everyone's comments on this thread which I have read with great interest.  Keep them coming!!!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Alison et al,<br><br>I think if you are in one place most of the time, a manual whiteboard is probably best.  In fact, with a wall, you don't need a whiteboard.<br><br>I'me working in Damascus for a year.  The one office (I move between two or more) is in the basement of an apartment block (cooler in summer!) and consists of a L-shaped general area and a manager's office "inside" the "L".  So there are several vertical surfaces, all of which the manager uses with Post-It notes, paper posters etc.<br><br>In fact, it's so impressive. I think I'll take a photo ot four and send a link to this forum.  Although 95% of this "extended whiteboard" is in Arabic, I can see that it acts as a project information system on the project which focuses on the status of customer/connection data surveys in the local water utility.<br><br>Depending on he space available in your office space, you could use ONE wall (or part) as the Backlog and Ready section, another area as the Doing/In Progress section, and a third one as Done.

<div class="content">My new modus operandi to meet the challenges of a bigger project planning and management role (involving colleagues and others) than in my recent past is basically:<br><br>- Project management software (new tricks for this old dog) for planning/scheduling phases, tasks, resources, and then updating in response to actual progress (or not). <br><br>- Kanban board for current/short-term work tasks including project and non-project elements.  As colleagues and the boss are not always in the same office, this will have to be a virtual one via the Internet.<br><br>- AF/DWM/DIT hybrid to capture stuff and scan.  A routine task will be to scan and monitor each project and then feed into my hybrid.  Can I cross an item off when it's been transferred into a kanban card?  I think so, it will allow the hybrid to reach into the new modus operandi akin to a closed list.<br><br>In line with my previous posting, I will probably have a manual kanban on the entrance lobby corner where  my apartment desk is.  This will primarily be for non-project work, personal, admin stuff etc.  One of these will be to learn the new project management software as best I can without formal training (the new Dummies book I got this week has already helped me make progress)<br><br>A luta continua - the struggle continues.</div>

<div class="content">"Roger<br>I think that you should use AF to feed your personal kanban and not the other way around. So I believe that your most recent post is a better idea then doing the reverse."<br><br>I prefer it the other way round.  I want to use AF to manage my tasks, and the kanban to manage my projects (ie generate tasks that I'll then put into AF).  I want the benefits of the AF method of choosing tasks to actually do, leaving the kanban to manage the planning of what those tasks need to be.<br><br>My 'projects' in the kanban (or 'stories', as AgileZen calls them) are really just mini-projects that each have more than one task.  At the moment I'm setting up a new laptop, so I have a number of stories in my kanban.  The first was to prepare for the transfer of everything from my existing laptop to the new one - tasks in that story included finding the CDs for each of the software applications I had to install on the new system, finding out whether I'd have to ask the manufacturers for new activation keys, copying all my files to an external hard drive and so on.  The next story was to install a new operating system - two tasks, get information about how to install it, and then actually install it.  The story I'm currently working on is to install the important software first, and it has a task for each software application.  I've put the tasks from that story into my AF list, and I'm working through them.  There are more stories waiting to be worked on, eg installing the less important software, and then decommissioning the old laptop.  But I don't have to worry about them yet because those stories are still in the Ready area, so none of the tasks have yet been put in my AF list.<br><br>All those stories in AgileZen are in the same colour.  I have another set of stories about tidying my house, some stories about stuff I need to do for work, and a few stories about things I want to update on my website.  I use a different colour for each of these three lots of stories.  At the moment, I'm up against a deadline to get the laptop set up because the old one has to be returned in a few days, so the only story in my Working area is the relevant "setting up the laptop" one.  But what I'm intending to do when this panic is over is to try to have a story of each colour in my Working area.<br><br>Single tasks like "buy a birthday card for X" go straight into AF.  If it's a task I know I won't do for quite a while, I put it in Google Calendar for a month or so hence.<br><br>I prefer a paper-based AF list, because it's so portable and easy to use.  But I like the on-line AgileZen implementation of the kanban, because it's so easy to structure and rearrange.  If I used post-it notes on a board, each one would only be for a single task, so I'd just have a stream of individual tasks flowing across the board, without any linkage between the ones that relate to each other.  But each story in AgileZen has all of its tasks listed together, and the whole story moves across the kanban.  When all of its tasks are done, it moves into the Complete area. <br><br>It remains to be seen how well this will work over the long term...!</div>

<div class="content">Ok, I've been confused about how the two opposing interpretations of my posts by Annette and Erik arose, but I think it was this: " AF/DWM/DIT hybrid to capture stuff and scan." which should have read , " . . . . capture OTHER stuff and scan."<br><br>I think my view is, as Annette says, kanban to handle the project tasks and feed them into/through AF.<br><br>My rationale is that project scheduling plus kanban requires a more singular focus on the projects/tasks without the distraction of other stuff that one corrals in AF.<br><br>As Annette states, let's see how it works out over the longer term.</div>

<div class="content">I'm studying Kanban theory for work projects and it's interesting. Although a board is nice for laying out project tasks and seeing things progress, that's not actually the point. The point of Kanban is to get things done as early as possible by minimizing the amount of stuff on the board. This is because things on the board represent things started but not finished, and the value comes from finishing, and then you can invest that value back into the business. <br><br>This seems quite the opposite of Mark's theories that order of work doesn't matter and everything is simply do or do not.  I can think of two reasons for this difference:<br><br>1. Life is not business and if you aren't trying to get someplace new, then prioritizing would be like trying to get life to complete. This is nonsense. Life is about living, not finishing. On the other hand, if you have a major goal, achieving the goal may transform your life into a better one, and many other tasks may become irrelevant. Mark and Kanban then agree on this: not doing something is a good idea. <br><br>2. In life there are often many little things that simply must get done.  The kanban system that says you can't water flowers because you've got 3 projects on the go already isn't very helpful. So when it comes to little things another method is needed to keep them in order.</div>

<div class="content">I think you are right, a Kanban is a tool as much as AF is a tool, they both have their strengths and their weaknesses and they should be understood before choosing what tool for what job! One thing I have noticed a while back is that there is a difference between things you want to do, things you have to do and things you should do. I have yet to see a system that can accommodate all of them.</div>

<div class="content">@Alan Baljeu<br>As you correctly pointed out the main focus of kanban is on finishing tasks before beginning new ones, but this doesn't hinder you to do "little things that simply must get done". You could design your system with different "swimming lanes" (Stephen Franklin provided a link to a good example above <a href="http://www.leankitkanban.com/Content/Images/Features/personelKanban.png" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.leankitkanban.com/Content/Images/Features/personelKanban.png</a> ). <br><br>Then you have the possibility to apply different WIP limits (work in progress) to the different lanes and you can easily water your flowers alongside your big project tasks. The example also has daily habits on it => very nice, you just move the card to completed when done and tomorrow you reset it to Todo.<br><br>With the kanban board you can do "the 10 foot, 3 second rule" check, which is impossible with a pure list like AF or DWM. The rule says that a person should be able to look at the Kanban board from 10 feet away, and should be able to understand what is going on within 3 seconds.<br>- Overall, does the board overflow with too many cards (tasks)?  <br>- Are too many items waiting in queues?<br>- Where are the bottlenecks?<br>- How many work items are blocked? Why? <br><br>(See <a href="http://toolsforagile.com/blog/archives/320#more-320" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://toolsforagile.com/blog/archives/320#more-320</a> for details).<br><br><br>Of course I do not say that you should have only 1 task open overall and finish it every time before going to the next task. But there should certainly be a limit on the number of started and yet unfinished tasks on your board. When you get over this limit your performance degrades due to context switching / multitasking losses. You need extra energy and concentration to pick up a task again after you left it unfinished some time ago and now need to get into it again (e.g. time for review where you left off or what were your ideas, plans back then). <br><br>You can do a nice little multi-tasking exercise (it just takes 3 minutes) to experience these "costs" <a href="http://www.clarkeching.com/2007/09/multi-tasking-e.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.clarkeching.com/2007/09/multi-tasking-e.html</a> .</div>

<div class="meta">2010-07-4 18:42</div>
<div class="content">I had the same impression on first look at the example, but if you closely look at it, you see that most cards are either prioritized (queued) to be done soon and some of them scheduled for today. Another big part are the completed tasks. It seems that the creator wants to distinguish tasks which were completed today from those of this week.<br><br>So really in process is only 1 per swim lane (limit is explicitly  set to 1 per lane).</div>

<div class="content">Well, I refined my views on that too...<br><br>Concerning actions, there are 3 basic steps before you can move on it:<br>Trigger, Thought, Action.<br>The basic question to ask is: do I do it when I notice the action needs to occur (trigger) or do I bucket (list) it for later... This depends on the nature of the action.<br>(by the way, Autofocus is excellent for managing triggers while GTD is not... for me)<br><br>There are also 3 basic steps for the execution of actions or tasks:<br>Prep, Doing, Cleanup<br><br>Rock actions (my previous bucket category) are things that accumulate easily in a bucket over time and you can dispatch in one fell swoop; like your laundry. These actions have some prep and cleanup but those do not change much considering the load of actions in the bucket. The action itself is often insignificant.<br><br>Nail actions are things that might or might not need prep and cleanup but usually do not have significant ones (like emails). But even if you bucket them, you will have to do every action one after another so the number of actions in the bucket make the completion of the bucket longer. These kind of actions actually benefit from doing them on the spot (when they are triggered) unless they are genuine distractions.<br><br>Noose actions are a complex series of actions that, if done in a certain order, create the effect that the whole is bigger then the sum. A good example would be doing the dishes while watching TV, it makes doing the dishes fun... The problem with noose actions is that they become routine after a while and if diversity is the spice of life for you, then you might feel trapped using those all the time.<br><br>My hint:<br>With maintenance stuff... rocks should be bucketed and nails not even entered in the system if possible and done on the spot. With project stuff, nails and rocks should be bucketed together and done when appropriate. But don't try to wait for similar rocks before you do those that you have already.</div>

<div class="content">Erik,<br><br>To add to what Alan said, if it were me, I'd have a library of SHORT videos, rather than a couple of hour long ones.  Many people don't have an hour to spend on figuring out if something is of interest to them.  OTOH, if they have a list of short (5 minutes or so) videos which promise to tell them specific things, then they could "drill in" on what they need.  For example, I'm only marginally interested in the notebook you use.  I have no particular feelings about it, pro or con, but I know that the search for the perfect notebook is an endless one and I've called mine off in favor of a cheap ($0.25) composition type book.  It serves my needs very well and I've moved on.  I LOVE notebooks but life is too short to keep pursuing the dream of finding the perfect one ;-)  HOWEVER, some folks are still searching for the perfect notebook and would love to see yours without wading through other parts of your site.

<div class="content">Thanks for the link Erik - I'll view it when I get time - I'm on holiday from tomorrow and although I can access the internet, I only have a mobile option which is really slow - so not good for downloading video!  I don't really understand all the ins and outs of different browsers - I tend to stick with what I know becuase I don't have the time to invest just now in sorting out another one!</div>

<div class="content">Mike,<br><br>Whilst the exact stationery you use is flexible, you need a set of post-it type tabs and a book with space to put 27 tabs on a single page. So probably not as flexible as autofocus. But is does more and has some rather elegant controls built in.<br><br>Erik,<br><br>I think you know that there a number of things you could do to make the site and content more accessible. I get the feeling that you are (possibly subconsciously) line fishing for like minded individuals rather than trawling for a general audience. Would this be fair?</div>

<div class="content">@Will<br>Yes Will, you are spot on!<br>And there is the fact that the site is just about a week old and I do intend to make it better. When I put the google group subscription option on, I had a lot of people signing up but that couldn't contribute because of the google wave thing... So I had to improvise and do a long intro video. If you'd seen my mind map for the project, I actually had 4 small videos separating all the seperate aspects as Mike suggested but I was pressed by time.<br><br>It's a work in progress and I welcome any constructive criticism. I was and still intend on making a website easier to navigate. But I will keep the format of videos.  Furthurmore, since the site is in google wave format, I effectively open source the concept to a point. I find that nice.<br><br>But I must admit I felt a bit down after the first few comments about the new format of the website after so much effort and what I thought was an innovative way of presenting content. But it actually made me to want to push on and do my thing. I must be fair to the people here who are probably used and like blogs in a written form and that is the reason why they are here!<br><br>Thanks for the comment and for subscribing to the site!</div>

Near the end of the day I see my nearly completed KanBan, in color and do a few more things to end up with a well balanced day. I look forward to seeing more of your ideas in video format.</div>

I do wonder about using Wave.  I don't have anything against it and from Google's presentation it sounds good, but I worry that it might be sometime before it becomes commonplace.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Erik,<br><br>I tried to respond with a comment on that site but it seems that they want you to set up an account, give email address, and all of that.  Sheesh.  What a bother.<br><br>My comment is firstly that those two latest videos are excellent.  I like that you have cut the length down and made them more modular.  The other small nit: in the second one you use a word in a way that seems a bit odd and probably does not convey the meaning you intend.<br><br>You say that a list is for "irrelevant" things.  I think the word you want is more like "exceptional" or "unusual" or "out of the ordinary" or "not typical" ... something like that.  "Irrelevant" conveys the sense of "not important" ... and I'm fairly sure that is not what you were trying to convey.  It seems to me that what you are getting at is that one puts on a list only those things that one is apt to forget, because they are not what one usually or normally does.  I always buy milk but I only need to buy crackers because of a party I'm having next week and I seldom have parties.<br><br>I found your take on "contexts" to be interesting as well.  As one of the walking wounded from the great GtD wars ;-) I'm very sensitive to the word "context".  That was the one thing that made GtD a nightmare for me.  It is such an "irrelevant" ;-) idea in today's society when done as suggested by GtD.  Using it, as you seem to, as a way of scheduling tasks, makes more sense.  My life has very few "contexts", as the term is used by GtD.  I always have my cell phone with me and since it is a smart phone I have, in my pocket at all times: phone, internet, documents, contact list, word processor, the latest book I'm reading, etc.  I can do almost anything at any time in any place.<br><br>I also liked you credit card example (as well as the food going bad in the fridge).  Nicely done.  This is the one big problem I had with AF, in all of its incarnations.  It is a large storage for miscellaneous things which masquerades as a To Do list.  IOW, there is no priority or even a commitment to do the things at all.  They just kind of lurk there until you might decide to do them.  It is like putting an unopened can of beans in the fridge ... it will never go bad.  OTOH, it is taking up valuable space that one needs for those things which WILL go bad if  not eaten soon.<br><br>Your approach (if I understand you correctly) is to somehow commit to WHEN you will do something the first time you think about it.  Your system seems to have no place for indecision.  I think that is an important feature for us procrastinators.  We LOVE to put things "on hold" so that we can remain indecisive about them for as long as possible.  The only help for it is to develop the practice of deciding INSTANTLY what we are going to do and WHEN we are going to do it ... then following through.<br><br>Keep up the good work.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Erik<br>I really, really like your ideas and videos! They're making me think about why managing my day and projects and tasks has been so hard. You are absolutely right about habits. If I think of something I need to do that is (already) a habit, I just do it fast. If I start thinking, sometimes I'll talk myself out of it. Conversely, if it's a habit I need to break, I do try to think about it and the reasons it's not good to automatically do that thing (ie., sit at the computer and check email all day long).<br>Re: your latest video. Instead of "irrevelant", maybe you could just call that list "unusual". That works for me.<br>Mark's forum and your input has made me realize more fully just how perfectionistic I am and I am learning how to stop myself from getting hung up on the perfect supplies. My system still has to look good though. I love how you use Post it notes. Needless to say, I already had a million of them in all different colors. Now to get over the fear of using them all up. At least if I do, I will have gotten a lot done!<br>Thank you again for all of your hard work. I hope everyone will watch your videos. They are well worth it. I installed Google Chrome just to use for your site. I still have IE on my computers to use for most everything else. I can run both at the same time without any problems.</div>

Once you start to wave, you'll never see the internet the same way again!<br><br>Remember that while I really like seeing my project starting to get wings, I also want to give proper respect to Mark's work which helped me sort out my concepts and that here is his real estate. We should be concentrating on his stuff, not mine :)</div>

<div class="meta">2010-08-5 10:00</div>
<div class="content">Erik,<br><br>If you want an opinion I offer mine.  Bag the video and write a carefully considered paper on your system.  Resist the temptation to put pictures of your book in there ... it is not essential to your system.  (Is the essence of your system a question of stationary or a concept of how to manage time?  If there were no Post-It flags, would your system still work?)  Carefully define your terms and flesh out the concepts.  Avoid the use of new terminology unless it is absolutely necessary.  (Nail? Noose?  We already have too many buzz words in this area.)  Once you think you have it, go back and edit ruthlessly.  Give it to selected people for review to be sure you chose words that conveyed what you wanted  to.<br><br>One thing your videos conveyed is that it is a system that seems to work well for you.  What you need to convey now is HOW and WHY the system will work for others no matter what kind of book or pen they use.  Just look at the success and failure of GtD to get a feel for what I'm saying.  It succeeded because of some KEY CONCEPTS that had not been addressed in other systems (contexts for one).  It failed because of David Allen's OCD like insistence on HIS preference for tools (using a mechanical label machine, avoiding hanging files, and ironically the slavish insistence that everything be done in a context, for some of those).  Only by explaining your system CONCEPTUALLY can you get to the essence of it and address your entire audience ... even those who don't live in Japan so they can buy the book you like.<br><br>It is hard to explain, but if you have any computer science background think in terms of a state diagram for a finite automata.  The ESSENCE of any system is about it's parts and how they change state as the system operates.  Ex: you have "tasks" that enter your system from various sources and they move from one "state" to another (waiting, readiness, action, completion, archival, etc.)  Certain "events" cause those tasks to move from one state to another.  That describes your "system" independently of how you manage to track those tasks, states, and events with notebooks or software.  Your system considers "energy" in its selection of tasks.  You do that with colored flags ... I'm sure there are other ways to manage that.<br><br>My system, for example, has the same information flowing into it as any one else.  We all get email, phone calls, have appointments, etc.  We all need reminders.  All of my information is collected in one place and that place is ONLY for collection.  I then "scan" that list to decide what is most important/urgent and put it on a second list of things that are scheduled to be done NEXT.  Those are only the first two steps, by you can see that I talked in terms of my "list" and not my "composition type sewn notebook" or "Post-It note containing my hot list".  In fact, I am relying more on software on my iPhone lately and that system conceptually mirrors my paper system.  I don't consider "energy" in my selection of tasks.  Maybe I should.  Maybe doing so undercuts discipline.  I don't know, I'll have to think about it.<br><br>Well, my point is that you seem to have worked out a good system and I think it will appeal to many others once they understand the essence of it and can find a way of implementing it with their own preferred tools.<br><br>I hope the demise of yet another solution to no particular problem from the bowls of Google will not deter you.  It was very predictable given Google's track record in abandoning products.  I'd hate to see your ideas go down with Google's technological ship.  ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Ilse,<br><br>You are right about learning styles, though actually I'm a very visual learner.  And in most cases I think well placed and considered pictures can be a BIG help.  However, in this case, the pictures largely substituted for the words and I was not able to get the idea from the pictures.  In fact, I only started to catch on to what Erik was doing because I did some research on ZtD and Kanban and then I started to grasp what Erik was trying to do with those damn Post-It flags.  Even with showing the Post-it flags on the white board I did not get what he was doing.  It seemed easier to just write it down.  The idea of "slots" did not register because there was not enough explanation.  Only when I saw how everyone else was doing Kanban (with cards and software) did I get the "slots" idea and then why the Post-it Flags seemed a logical solution to a portable system.  As soon as I saw that it was a way of managing "just in time" manufacturing, it all fell into place.<br><br>My point is, and I perhaps did not make it well enough previously, that it would have been so simple to understand if it had just been written out clearly and concisely with the reasons given at the time the instruction is given.  Without that, it looked like just another eccentric way to set up a day planner.  (Well, clearly I knew there was more to it than that or I'd not have done the research to understand what the point of it was.   And I put that down to Erik's on-camera "presence" that conveyed how well the system actually worked for him.)<br><br>I suppose it is also not just a question of video.  Mark's AF system was very difficult to understand, despite its basic simplicity because it was given as a list of rules and the rest was left to discussion on a forum.  (With AF1, I, and several others NEEDED to make and publish flow charts to grasp it!  And none of us is an idiot!  ;-)  By contrast, his book was crystal clear because writing imposes so much more disciple on thinking.  By the time I finished his book I understood the evolution of his thought and how AF1, and his future systems came about.  Had I read his book FIRST, I'd have saved so much time.<br><br>But that said, I feel that Erik probably likes the video medium and does it better than most so he will most likely stick with that.  It is kind of moot so far as I'm concerned because I think I have his basic idea and know which parts of it might be of use to me.  (Definitely NOT the Post-it Flags, though I grant it is an ingenious solution.  ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Woa, a lot to reply on those but thanks again for the input.<br><br>I find that I did not voluntarily put emphasis on tools but you seemed to have picked up on that Mike. Don't know why but it was my first video so.... And if you remember, I put it together because I had a number of people wanting more explanation about my system. Since it was done, I didn't want to remake it just yet.<br><br>Now as for the Kanban and slotting, I wanted to talk about those and much more but it would have made a 3 hours video so I decided to do a basic system one and then expand on concepts, methods and principles in future videos (a kind of videocast). As you can see in the videos mindmap, there is a lot of territory that's not-covered yet!<br><br>I intend to write a book about it when I have integrated more of it and put it to practical use through other people to make sure I'm not just dreaming everything. Also, I'm still integrating what I have, and I say this lightly, "discovered". I don't have terminology as you noticed but I'm trying to find it. Though the words are not that precise as of yet, I hope this will change with me explaining it to others. It makes sense in my head but difficult to explain.<br><br>One thing that I want to make clear though is that I, unlike most other people that made systems out there, never give rules. I don't say you have to take this and process it this way. What I give are concepts and principles, I leave each person to decide on their way of using the system. Maybe that is where it stands out in a weird way. There is no definite best way to use it and everybody will do it differently. Also, it is to get you back OUT of your lists and into the real world and engage with it without compromising your engagements.<br><br>Yes, there is a lot more behind the hood and more things have to be understood before it can be used effectively. I see Mike has done his research and found that I did mine too ;) I truly believe that the simplest tool can be used to better effect if mastered (understood masterfully) instead then a complex tool not understood. Just look at the number of people that take photos and use the Zoom to actually get closer to their subject... Zooms are not meant for that! They are meant to change the angle of view, hence depth of field and a lot of by-products... There is no good way to take a picture, but if you understand the components, you can start to be artistic in the process and choose your options depending on the situation. You adapt the system on the fly to suit your needs :)<br><br>@Ilse<br>Don't worry, I will leave them where they are and build on them. I like this project and doing what you like is probably more important then being successful... I plan 1 a week if possible, we'll see what the future holds.<br><br>But I must re-itarate that I really like Mike's comments. Even if I disagree with some of it, it makes me understand why I disagree which is a treasure all in itself. Not understanding why you do things is a curse and he is helping me lift it and gain more focus on my project!</div>

I tried and failed. I have seen the application of post-its before. Tried and failed again. Too flimsy and not Kanban-enough.<br><br>It's Erik's type of see-through plastic tabs, size and type of the notebook that it's important to me. But even more his understanding of energy, type of actions, "contents" triggers and so on. Vocabulary is a secondary issue here.

<div class="content">Will,<br><br>"Time tomatoes"  ROTFLMAO ;-)  You know just exactly how to turn a phrase.<br><br>Flags:  Yeah, it is a brilliant idea and I can see where it would work.  My problem with it is that it is "fiddly".  I try to steer clear of fiddly systems.  In the long run, they don't work for me.  Something inevitably goes wrong and the whole system stops.  One day I'd run out of the right colored flag and not be able to progress with my To Dos.  LOL my kingdom for the right colored Post-it flag.  Yeah, but I could make due, right?  Yes, so why not make do ALL of the time and not use something that fiddly.<br><br>As to other ways ... well, how about three colored pens and put a colored dot in front of each of three tasks to note which slot it was in.  Or forget the color and just use three different marks ... or label three tasks A,  B, C.  Or just do the whole thing in your head superimposing the idea on top of the physical list. ... i.e. sequence the list and the next three are the ones to do next and the ones after are those you "pull" from your backup list, etc.  Hey, I've got it, how about a prioritized list written in order that you will do the tasks for the day?  LOL ;-)<br><br>Yeah, cards ... people still use them.  You can still buy notebooks with slots for 3x5 cards to make a project book and move the cards around.  With that approach, you'd have enough room to write stuff on the card and could make meaningful annotations as you went.  If you HAD to have color, colored cards are cheaper than Post-it flags.  But just a quick story about that kind of thing in general.  I saw a project manager of a BIG project get fired (well, errr... promoted ;-) because of this method.  His walls were covered in Post-It notes which he moved around.  People would come into his office in a hurry and set off a blizzard of post-its which they would run around picking up and he would figure out which to stick on which wall.  The project was in a mess and fell farther and farther behind and I now have no doubt that it was because of his over fiddly system.<br><br>However my biggest problem with the system, so far as i understand it at this point, is that work items are not like bolts and washers.  They are not of fixed size and of equal value to the completion of a product.  I work in a world where what I have to do might take 5 minutes or two weeks ... and I mostly like to work on things to exhaustion.  Contrary to the little and often philosophy, I find that thinking work requires intense concentration for long periods of uninterrupted time.  Anything less does not produce acceptable results ... for me. <br><br>The other problem I have with it is that, for me, it is a solution looking for a problem.  There seems to be some screaming need to get away from a To Do list.  I don't feel that need. The concept of writing down what you want to do and then doing it is the simplest and most straight forward answer to the problem of how to get work done.  I see people hanging around productivity sites for years (and clearly I have been as well to make that observation) trying to find a "better" way.  In what way could anything be "better"?<br><br>From observing others and looking at myself I think what "better" means is to make work more fun.  But work is not fun ... which is why they call it "work" and not "fun".  There are always going to be things that we need to do that we don't WANT to do ... and we have to just suck it up and do them.  No system, no way of writing in in colored inks, no colored cards or paper with ruled lines at measured intervals, no software ... NO WAY of recording what you need to do is going to make what you need to do more "fun" if it is not "fun".  I think the best way to preserve sanity in handling life is to acknowledge that we often have to do things we don't want to do ... and then go ahead and do them anyway without complaint.<br><br>I once saw a man who (must have been one of the most productive people on the planet) at work.  He was a VP of a corporation I worked for and that day he had to give addresses to many small groups of employees.  (The company had violated federal law and was under investigation.)  Clearly this load was added to his already Herculean schedule.  I watched him work with complete efficiency in utter amazement.  How did he do it?  In a way it was a simple prioritized To Do list ... but since he was a VP he delegated the entire process of managing the list to his secretary.  All he did was "take orders", in matters of Time Management.  As he was walking down the hallway between these meetings his secretary was feeding him information about the next thing and getting decisions about what to do next.  Based on what she told him, he would give her more information and she would make notes on what she had to do to follow up, then feed the next thing to him.  He really was just "taking orders".  She told him what he had to do and he did it.  No matter that he was making the actual thinking decisions about the WORK.  SHE was prioritizing it and feeding the tasks to him for those decisions.  SHE determined what he needed to know now or what later.  SHE determined which calls he got and which were deferred.  She told him which room to go to for the next meeting and then what to do next.  In terms of HOW he used his time, he was an utter robot under her control based on the priorities he had set up for his day.<br><br>From that experience I took a new model of personal time management.  I don't have a secretary to do a lot of this work for me, but I can do just a bit of mental juggling and IMAGINE that wearing one hat I am in charge of the work flow and I give orders to myself wearing the hat of the person who actually does the work.  For me, at least, distinguishing between managing WORK and managing the managing of the work are two different things.  I know that I experience the greatest problems in time management when I let the work interfere with the scheduling of the doing of the work.  IOW, the whole idea of scanning a list that takes up many pages in a book to find the task that "feels ready to be done" is destructive.  It mixes how I feel about a work item with my rational understanding of how and when it should be done relative to my life's priorities.  When I'm not in the heat of battle, so to speak, I can rationally evaluate the work without FEELING how much I might dread it.  It is at that point that I can make a rational decision.  I can't make rational decisions while "in the trenches".  So as a planner I make the decisions and as a doer I execute the plan.  I find that mixing those two things up makes a mess of it all.  (In this way David Allen is right ... do the thinking first then do the execution later.  I don't think he has it right in HOW to accomplish that, however.)<br><br>But the key principle that has to be in place before I can do it this way is that of knowing that I might rather be goofing off somewhere than mucking the stables yet the stables still HAVE to be mucked ... no matter how much I'd rather not do it.  Without that deep understanding, it becomes a continual battle with myself about how to schedule (i.e. AVOID) work.<br><br>I think we go far wrong when we focus on how to track and record what work we need to do.  The real focus needs to be on changing our entire outlook on the need for work and how it relates to who we are and what we value in life.<br><br>Just a few thought for this Friday morning.<br><br>Belly skritches to Rosy.  Louise sends two butt sniffs her way  ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Ilse,<br><br>I'm happy that it works for you, of course.  I'm all in favor of ANYTHING that works.  Five languages?  I'm very impressed ;-)  But I'm really not critical of Erik's use of English.  What I was trying to get to is that for the concept to be clearly conveyed it needs to be clearly presented and that takes writing.  Only writing allows one to think about the subject with clarity.  Simply talking about it to a camera places no demand on being clear.  It also places no demand on deeply understanding the system in the first place.<br><br>As to energy and all of that ... I see that as part of the problem.  If I say that I don't have enough "energy" to do something, I'm really saying that I don't WANT to do it.  It is just an excuse.  We MAKE our energy.  That is not to say that I don't honor basic physiology.  I get enough sleep.  I schedule work for parts of the day that correspond to my natural high and low energy periods.  But I think chaos lies in deciding what you FEEL like doing, on the fly, and deciding what to attempt based on that.  I think just the opposite approach is needed.  IOW,"I don't feel like this but I'm going to do it anyway because it is the right thing to do at this time."<br><br>Many of these "new" systems seem to be a flight from self-discipline.  Self-discipline is the engine that runs us and gets us to our goals.</div>

<div class="content">Keep going, Erik. You ARE onto something for those of us whose minds function like yours does, and you are really helping us see why the traditional time management ideas and procedures don't work. When I am more awake, I will post about how I packed up and sold my house, packed up and moved my retail store across the US in the space of 6 weeks in a down housing market last fall-using post-its. I could have made lists for years.  And I would still be there.<br>I think it's those of us who have very creative mindsets that have the most trouble with the usual systems. It leads to "tinkering" with systems. That is not to say others aren't creative--everyone has creativity in them--but not everyone has learned to "let it out".</div>

<div class="content">Re: Kanban.<br><br>I've not spent a lot of time thinking about this but my initial reaction to it was: Why?  What is the problem people have that Kanban solves?<br><br>Kanban, according to my limited investigation, is a system designed to facilitate "just in time" manufacturing.  It endeavors to get "parts" to various stages of production and distribution just exactly when they are needed with no expensive inventory on hand.  That does not describe what we are doing in a personal time management system -- at all.<br><br>What personal time management attempts to do is tell you WHAT to work on so that it is completed AT LEAST in time.  I.e. not JUST in time.  There is no virtue, in personal time management, to putting things off until the last minute.  In personal time management, there is no real "inventory" to be stocked.  Also, we are not managing a collection of like items.  A manufacturer needs to have 100 washers on hand at all times to cover himself at his current rate of production.  When he reaches some level he needs to reorder so that he will not run out or even encroach on his minimum.  This does not begin to describe personal time management.<br><br>From what I've learned, the similarity is taken to be in the "container" and in personal time management that is taken to be a fixed slot of time.  Erik notes that he has (I think he said 5, I forget now) "slots" to fill during the day.  For me, that is an entirely artificial concept.  My day is not made up of "slots".  It is a continuous period of time between waking and sleeping.  It is roughly 16 hours but I don't even divide it into hours.  It is just continuous. <br><br>Certainly what I need to do, the contents of the container, are not all equal.  My To Do list might look like:<br><br>- Make breakfast and lunch<br>- Read email<br>- Do laundry<br>- Read an essay by Gregory Bateson and annotate, outline, and mind map it<br>- Transfer some software to one of the computers<br>- Follow up on auto accident<br>- Explain to my alpha tom cat why he can't terrorize one of the queens<br>- Research a treadmill<br>- etc.<br><br>Now some of those are high priority and some low.  Some take 5 minutes some several hours.  Some must be done in a single sitting, others can be "in the background" while I'm doing other things.  Some allow interruption, others require concentration.  In short, everything about the tasks is different ... except that I have decided that they need to be done today.<br><br>So I'm left with wondering why I'd try to force fit my To Do list into the Kanban concept.</div>

<div class="content">Erik/anyone who's interested:<br>I said I'd get back to this in my last post here. I'm awake now!<br>When I knew I was going to sell my house and move me and my store from the east coast to the west coast of the US, I started making lists of things I had to do. Lots of lists, many pages, and never got a thing done except feel overwhelmed. The housing market was in the pits and I was under a deadline. Finally, I realized I had better do what had always worked for me in the past: get it visual and colorful.<br>I had a townhouse with a basement (craft room, laundry room/bathroom, and storeroom), a main floor (living room, kitchen, dining room), and an upstairs (with 3 bedrooms, a bathroom and hallway). I took three 36" x 45" pieces of matboard and quickly drew each floor's floorplan on it. I then hung each one on the appropriate floor where I would see it each time I was in the area.<br>Then I took post-its and stood in each room and wrote down everything I needed to do in that room --one post-it for each task. I stuck them on the matboard (in the appropriate room). I just used a variety of colorful post-its, but didn't assign colors to particular tasks. That would have created too many decisions to make and besides I might run out of a particular color, etc. I just made it colorful and inviting. There were a LOT of stickies.<br>I continued to add post-its as I thought of things. Each time I went by the matboards, I looked to see what I could do. I pulled the post-its off as I did the tasks or put them in a little calendar that I carried around with me or took with me when I did errands and bought things I needed for the move. I never rewrote the tasks on another list. I was truly the "stickie queen". I did the same thing at my store. Each floor's matboard was a little Kanban of sorts, I see now. When the agent came to list the house, the matboards were empty. I hid them under the bed. When the house sold, I brought them out and started putting post-its on again, but these were related to the packing and actual move. <br>It was amazing how easily I kept up with everything I needed to get done. I was able to do all the little repairs, decluttering, staging, etc. by myself, and sold the house in 17 days for the full asking price. I had several offers because it looked really good: no clutter, neat cupboards and spotless. <br>We loaded the UHaul up and drove across country and reopened the store here.<br>Everyone's mind works a little differently. The trick is to find out, as Erik says, how OUR mind works. No one system fits all. I appreciate Mark's ways of presenting lots of different systems, some intuitive, some more black and white. For some reason, I identify with what Erik is trying to say. I may have to watch the videos several times and think about what he is saying, but it's worth it. It's so good to have so many ideas and viewpoints expressed.</div>

<div class="content">@White Swan<br><br>Thanks! It's a very good example of visualizing your work and what I'll cover a little later in the videos about dispersing your triggers.

Doing only 30 minutes of email and keeping the rest for the next day answers the problems about your emails at the source: your involvement with it. If you notice that it takes you more time to do it but you don't give yourself permission to do it, then you'll ACTUALLY start to change your habit and way of thinking to match the reality you chose instead of the reality imposed on you. You actively start for better ways to do those things and eliminate the useless in it.<br><br>But actually USING the kanban (where the rubber hits the road) is where a lot of by-products come fore. You have a radiator of information helping you to plan and also review what you have done. So you are able to base your future actions on your past ones. Building your day becomes a thing you can actually see. Budgeting it makes sure that you prioritize only the things that are most important to you (if you have only 3 blocs in creativity, then you'll naturally choose the ones with the highest return). Limiting you makes you creative.<br><br>But most of all, the backlog is not the focus anymore! The focus is what you do and what you have done. It's a much more positive feedback than an endless list of things you haven't got around to do yet. The kanban says to you, good job, you really done progress today! You have to actually use it to go from knowing to understanding it...</div>

<div class="content">Hi Erik,<br><br>>>>Why:<br>Just in time manufacturing solves the problem of flow in a system, using it on a manageable value (blocs of energy) helps it flow better.  <<<<br><br>See, this is where precision comes into play, I believe.  What is a "block of energy"?  That is metaphorical at best and confusing and misleading at worst.  "Energy" is a term with precise meaning.  It is electrical, magnetic, heat, light, etc.  It is measured and quantified.  The whole "physic energy" is total nonsense.  If you can't define it and measure it then you don't know what it is you are seeing.  Assigning it a name without having a reason to do so stops thinking.  The energy you describe seems to "flow".  In what way does it flow?  Along wires?  I'm not being a pest here ... I think one really needs to be precise when dealing with concepts.<br><br>>>>  Furthermore, there is no real process apart from to do, doing and done here so it is not as linked to manufacturing as one might think.  <<<<br><br>Well, that is my point.  There is NO link to manufacturing.  It is a cool sounding idea that someone read about and has popularized, so far as I can tell.  As to processing tasks ... there are things you do with them that should be considered in any good system ... plan, schedule, do, archive, file, etc.  I'm not sure how many of those really needed to be encoded into a time management system, but they ARE there and might possibly<br><br>>>>  "Just in Time" has been dropped recently for "Lean manufacturing" when people understood more of the consequences of using this system rather then the intended goals. And when you think of lean, it's not a stretch to see that it is very close to the minimalist mentality (simplify your life).  <<<<br><br>Perhaps, but in what way does that tell me that this is the best way to manage my list of things to do?<br><br>>>>  The just in time aspect is to act on your energy right now but fill it with things you really have to do. <<<<br><br>Which gets us back to the importance of defining energy.  The closest thing to "energy" I can identify that seems to correspond to what you are describing is "alertness" and that is more or less irrelevant.  I mean, if I have something to do I have it to do, and how much I feel like working is not important.  Self-discipline and self-respect demand self-control not blowing things off because I don't "feel like it".<br><br>>>>   It also helps keep those hard triggers (habits) that are mainly of maintenance origin to be triggered over and over through a soft trigger mechanism like a list.  <<<<br><br>That was another thing I did not get, though it did not seem too important because I think most people understand habits.  Habits don't need triggering ... that is the whole point of them.  I brush my teeth in the morning when I get up ... and that is a habit and not "triggered" by anything.  It might seem as if it is triggered by time, but I don't experience it as triggering at all.  It is just what I do.  But I will grant that some habits can be triggered.  I'm not sure what that knowledge does for me though.  What I'm saying here is that this seems obvious and therefore not of much real value to consider in a time management system.<br><br>>>>  When it comes time to clean my house, I'll do it but doing it before that is a waste of time. It helps retrain your mind to your habits by "showing" you your regular intervals.  <<<<br><br>I agree that there is little value to clean the house before it "needs to be cleaned" and so that is exactly WHY I don't do it on regular intervals and it is not a "habit".  When my feet stick to the floor it is time to mop the kitchen ;-)  I don't need a schedule.  I used to do it that way, on schedule, but I found that I was cleaning more than living.  So now I clean when I SEE that it needs it ... or perhaps if I'm having guests over.<br><br>Secondly, I know my "intervals".  That is what a calendar is for.<br><br>>>>  And, doing it like that makes you re-evaluate "when" you have to start taking care of the problem because it will take some time before it is processed so you notice it before it becomes a problem... It moves it from the "Important, Urgent" quadrant to the "Important, not urgent" one.  <<<<br><br>Yes, but so does my To Do list.  I prioritize it by quadrant (loosely).  I know how long things take and when I need to start.  That is why this seems a solution searching for a problem.  I can't imagine that anyone does not know now long it takes them to mop the kitchen without using colored Post-It flags to keep track.<br><br>>>>  In personal time management, you are right, there is no inventory to be stocked, but in Life Management, I believe there is. <<<<br><br>???  Firstly, "life" management IS "time" management.  It is just switching around buzz words to sound cool.  I've seen that happening a lot lately.  Some people are betting that if they change the name they can repackage the old concepts and sell new books.  Secondly, what inventory?  I completely get why one would want to look at it one way as opposed to another.  But the THING is the same and that is what needs to be managed.  We have things to do and limited time to do them so we need to prioritize.  Nothing changes that fact.<br><br>>>>  Time can be seen in 3 ways, Slots, you flow in it or it flows around you. Some people see it differently and that is why no system is good for everybody because it identifies with one way of seeing time. <<<<br><br>Yes, that makes perfect sense.  HOWEVER, time is what it is.  No matter how you want to think about it, holidays and critical tasks are due periodically.  Calling it one thing vs another does not change that.<br><br>>>>  I have 20 slots to fill during the day, not 5 but 6 different kinds of energy uses. Doing only 30 minutes of email and keeping the rest for the next day answers the problems about your emails at the source: your involvement with it. If you notice that it takes you more time to do it but you don't give yourself permission to do it, then you'll ACTUALLY start to change your habit and way of thinking to match the reality you chose instead of the reality imposed on you. You actively start for better ways to do those things and eliminate the useless in it.  <<<<br><br>That is true enough, but let's look at it with more precision.  You have 20 slots (I misremembered the number from your video).  Why 20?  Why not 1, or 100?  Why not infinite?  Time IS continuous, after all.  (Well, on the macro level we humans exist on.)  I don't have to do email for 30 minutes, I can do it for 29 or31 if I so choose.  "Slots" seem such an artificial construct.  Even those fans of working timed bursts (a la Pomadoro) chose different values.  And just because email takes a slot size of 30 minutes, why should that impose the same (or an integral multiple) on the next thing I need to do?  Eating a sandwich for lunch might take only 10 minutes and that leaves me with what?  A "semi-slot" of 20 minutes left over?<br><br>And I agree that doing things differently for a while will change one's thinking about it ... but why does that imply slots or any particular WAY of doing them?<br><br>Finally, I still don't get the "energy" thing.  In an general way I'm sharper in the morning and less sharp in the afternoon.  But other than those general guidelines, what has to be done has to be done and I need to do it regardless of my "energy", whatever that is.<br><br>>>>  But actually USING the kanban (where the rubber hits the road) is where a lot of by-products come fore. You have a radiator of information helping you to plan and also review what you have done. So you are able to base your future actions on your past ones. Building your day becomes a thing you can actually see.  <<<<br><br>I can SEE the items on my To Do list.  Post-it Flags don't add anything but complexity to it so far as I can see.<br><br>>>>   Budgeting it makes sure that you prioritize only the things that are most important to you (if you have only 3 blocs in creativity, then you'll naturally choose the ones with the highest return). Limiting you makes you creative.  <<<<br><br>Again, why do I need THAT system to budget my time. I've been doing time blocking (scheduling) for as long as I've been managing my time.  Estimate how long a task will take and clear space for it in my day.  Drawing "slots" and using Post-It flags does not change that.<br><br>>>>  But most of all, the backlog is not the focus anymore!  <<<<br><br>What is it about this system that takes the focus from the backlog any more than my To Do list?  I choose what I put on my list as much as you do and I can choose to put backlog items on it or current ones ... my choice.<br><br>>>>  The focus is what you do and what you have done. <<<<br><br>Why in this system and not in any other?<br><br>>>>  It's a much more positive feedback than an endless list of things you haven't got around to do yet.  <<<<br><br>The list is only endless if you manage it that way.  My list tends to have about 1/2 dozen or so items on it ... no more.  My AF list had hundreds and I fixed that when it drove me nuts.  ;-)<br><br>>>> The kanban says to you, good job, you really done progress today! <<<<br><br>So does a To Do list with all items scratched off!<br><br>>>>  You have to actually use it to go from knowing to understanding it...   <<<<br><br>Yes, I get that.  But before you can ask someone to undertake a new system you need to give them a reason to think it will be worth it.  That is what my posts here have been about.  You have a new system that works for you.  You are trying to explain why it will work for others.  In order to be successful you need to deal with this kind of objection.  I watched your videos and agreed with much of what you had to say, but the ESSENCE of the system has not been justified.  Putting aside Post-it Flags for a moment, you have not shown why the basic idea of "slots" or "energy" makes sense.  To me, fixed time slots are a way of doing things but there is no justification to get me to adopt it.  My decades old time boxing works well.  I'm never going to use it so that I can understand it because I can't see any reason to try it in the first place.<br><br>We have people here presenting ideas like OPA, GtD, ZtD, AF 1-4, DWM, etc.  ANY of these systems will work.  Why would I be convinced to try them?  Any of those presenting a new system can say: "If you don't try it you'll never know."  But that implies that I have nothing better to do than try time management systems.<br><br>Remember, the most successful time management system of all time was the simple prioritized To Do list.  It can be done on the back of an envelop with anything that can make a mark on paper.  It requires no special expensive book or pen or ... well anything special.  There has to be a good reason, I mean something that stands cost/benefit analysis, to change to something more complex.<br><br>Perhaps you have found the ULTIMATE system.  So far I've not seen anything to convince me.</div>

<div class="content">Look Mike, I actually resent a lot of stuff in you recent replies...<br><br>Let me first say that I'm not here to convince you.<br>You can think what you want, but you are giving your opinion about something you haven't actually tried. I respect your advice as long as it stands for someone new to it and sees it from the outside but I cannot take it seriously as someone that understands what's happening. So most of my writing time is spent to debunk what you say so that new people don't take your opinion at face value and dismiss my efforts outright.<br><br>Now let me tell you why I use this system because I really, really resent this. I'm not a procrastinator. I'm not a whinner and if you knew me personally, you'd soon discover that I'm a workaholic. I have never made excuses for the work I HAD to do and always put my discomfort aside.<br><br>Six months ago I got sick, actually really sick; went to the hospital for 20 days, lost 7 kilos and my family thought I would die (no jokes here)... I clearly was exhausted physically, mentally and emotionally. I was a pure working machine productive to the core and it got me the hospital and a foot in the grave. At that point I was faced with what my life meaning was and what I was leaving behind and I was very disappointed to say that the way I was living was noy something that you care much about on your deathbed. I HAVE to check myself from working too much otherwise I actually get sick again so that is why I started to rephrase how I worked and engaged with life.<br><br>Take it from someone that has actually had this life experience when I say that there IS such a thing as those kinds of energy. My system is not about being productive, it's about managing your life and do something creative in the process.<br><br>When my systems says to me: Erik, stop working, you should be having fun now, I don't want to listen to it and I want to continue working on my site and all but from experience, I can tell you it's much to my advantage to listen to it. But if I had my amount of fun for the day, it's time for my chores and the system tells you that also so now dodging around.<br><br>Anyways, my system tells me that quite a lot of my productive time as been eaten up by these conversations and I find I don't serve myself and those that actually want to know more about it doing so. Therefore, I hope you won't take it personally if my replies to your messages become less frequent.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Pete,<br><br><<<  Habits are things we do without thinking and so without procrastination, our brain is 'hard wired' to do them, hence 'hard triggers'.  <<<<br><br>But that begs the question.  We do them without thinking, to be sure ... that is the very nature of them.  But you've not demonstrated that they are "triggered".  I mean, it is fine to insist that they are, but insisting and demonstrating it or proving it are different things.<br><br>And I'd also take issue with the idea that our "brain is hardwired".  There is a lot of work going on in the study of neurology but nothing yet clearly demonstrates any kind of hard wiring.  Some think so, others think not.  It might be more like a change in "firmware" if you are conversant with computer science.  Something between hardware and software.  Something that is one way "hard wired" but in another way "soft" so that it can be modified.  An "eprom", IOW.  But enough of metaphor.  We don't know for sure what habits are or how they really work.<br><br>>>>  Tasks are things we think about, use our 'mental software' before doing, so are called 'soft triggers', as we're not hard wired to do them.  <<<<br><br>Firstly, it is not the "tasks" that are triggers but the tasks ARE triggered, in this construct.  But I also disagree with the construct on the basis of it not making clear distinctions.  Habits are also "tasks" or strings of "tasks".  And I also see no justification for making up a term like "soft trigger" when the term needed is "chosen".<br><br>>>>  It seems you're missing some important points from the videos. Maybe watch the videos, make notes as you go, then review and rewrite the notes to get an overview of all the concepts.  <<<<br><br>ROTFLMAO ;-)  You know me better than that, Pete.  The old argument that "if you don't agree it is because you don't understand because if you understood you'd have to agree that It's right" is so tired!  No, I did not miss anything beyond what I said I missed.  I'm at least sharp enough to know what I missed when I miss it!   That is exactly why I went looking for more information from people who had taken the trouble to present the whole story of Kanban.<br><br>No, I am arguing that the concepts are ill defined, contradictory, redundant, and simply don't apply in many, if not most cases.  This is not a product of lack of understanding .. but of CLEARLY understanding the concepts presented and finding them wanting.<br><br>Now that is not to say that there are concepts which have not yet been presented.  That is one of the downsides of putting ideas out in a video blog.  No matter how well executed (and it IS well executed) the concepts are dribbled out over time and so one never knows when one has them all.  The statement that "I'll cover that later" does not wash.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Erik,<br><br>Where to begin?<br><br>>>>  Look Mike, I actually resent a lot of stuff in you recent replies...  <<<<br><br>Well, you'd not be the first, and certainly won't be the last to resent something I've said.  OTOH, I can only note that resenting the messenger rather than carefully considering the feedback is a sure sign that you are not convinced of those ideas yourself.  If you had a real handle on them, you'd have no trouble defending them from any criticism.  (And trust me, there will be much more from others.)<br><br>>>>  Let me first say that I'm not here to convince you.  <<<<br><br>Well, you clearly are, else why would you put up a website with a video blog to ... errrr ... convince people of the value of your new system?  If you had nothing to prove, you'd not have gone through what must have been a considerable effort to put up that website.<br><br>>>>  You can think what you want, but you are giving your opinion about something you haven't actually tried.  <<<<br><br>That old chestnut?  You can't know suicide is bad until you've tried it?  ROTF ;-)  Clearly you presented your ideas to get people to TRY your system.  To that end you've given REASONS why yous system is good.  I'm telling you why those reasons are not sufficient to get me to try it.  IOW, I've seen it all before so I don't need to try it.<br><br>>>>  I respect your advice as long as it stands for someone new to it and sees it from the outside but I cannot take it seriously as someone that understands what's happening. So most of my writing time is spent to debunk what you say so that new people don't take your opinion at face value and dismiss my efforts outright.  <<<<br><br>I would expect nothing less.  My observations are critical of your system as you've presented it.  You need to present it better, or more completely, or demonstrate that what I've pointed out is just plain wrong.  Any of those ought to do it for you.<br><br>>>>  Now let me tell you why I use this system because I really, really resent this. <<<<br><br>Well, life is like that sometimes.  You can resent things or understand what is being said.  Your choice.<br><br>>>>  I'm not a procrastinator. I'm not a whinner and if you knew me personally, you'd soon discover that I'm a workaholic. I have never made excuses for the work I HAD to do and always put my discomfort aside.  <<<<br><br>Actually, I did not attribute any of those things to you.  That you put that out front, suggesting that I have, is puzzling.  In fact, somewhere in my comments I remarked that I was sure the system was working for you because you conveyed a sense of integrity about your use of the system.<br><br>>>>  Six months ago I got sick, actually really sick; went to the hospital for 20 days, lost 7 kilos and my family thought I would die (no jokes here)<br><br>DAMN, but you are sensitive!  Do you always put stuff out there like that and dare people to comment on it?  incredible.<br><br>>>>  ... I clearly was exhausted physically, mentally and emotionally. I was a pure working machine productive to the core and it got me the hospital and a foot in the grave. At that point I was faced with what my life meaning was and what I was leaving behind and I was very disappointed to say that the way I was living was noy something that you care much about on your deathbed. I HAVE to check myself from working too much otherwise I actually get sick again so that is why I started to rephrase how I worked and engaged with life.  <<<<br><br>O.K.  In short, a life changing experience.  Got it.<br><br>>>>  Take it from someone that has actually had this life experience when I say that there IS such a thing as those kinds of energy. My system is not about being productive, it's about managing your life and do something creative in the process.  <<<<br><br>So your proof of those concepts is that you believe them.  Right.  Not good enough.  I might believe in the Easter Bunny but that is not going to convince anyone else.<br><br>>>>  When my systems says to me: Erik, stop working, you should be having fun now, I don't want to listen to it and I want to continue working on my site and all but from experience, I can tell you it's much to my advantage to listen to it. But if I had my amount of fun for the day, it's time for my chores and the system tells you that also so now dodging around.  <<<<br><br>Yes, that part of things makes sense.  We all get feedback on ourselves.   You get it from your system, others get it in other ways.  Your getting feedback does not prove anything about your system.  Other systems provide it as well.<br><br>>>>  Anyways, my system tells me that quite a lot of my productive time as been eaten up by these conversations and I find I don't serve myself and those that actually want to know more about it doing so. Therefore, I hope you won't take it personally if my replies to your messages become less frequent.   <<<<br><br>Of course I don't take it personally.  Why should I take your resentment of me personally?  ROTF ;-)  Look, I provided feedback to you ... deal with it or avoid it ... no skin off of my nose.  I've seen systems come and go for decades.  This system is no different than many others I've seen ... just the same concepts remixed and repackaged.  David Allen had some NEW ideas to offer.  Mark and some NEW ideas to offer.  I can't think of anyone else in the last 4 or 5 decades who did other than repackage the ideas of others.<br><br>And there is nothing wrong with it.  What IS wrong is thinking that there IS something new when it is the same old stuff.  I GET your Post-it Flags.  I think it is a creative use of material.  Your cool notebook is perfectly fine ... if you like that format and are willing to pay $3 for 100 pages of blank paper.  I think a exposition like: "Here is how I use the Kanban idea with my stationary." is what you should have titled it, because that is what you are doing.<br><br>I GET that you had a life changing experience and this system is of a very high value to you.  Others of us have had life changing experiences and have our own systems that are of high value to us.  I have integrated various time management ideas over several decades and LOVED my system.  I though there was nothing better.  I had customized sheets for this and that, all punched to fit into various binders for various purposes.  It was the ONLY system and it worked perfectly and I could not image any other.  Until I changed my life style.  I left the computer industry.  I took on other projects.  I no longer lived on planes and in hotels.  I lived out of my pocket with a cell phone and a laptop near by.  So my "perfect" system was no longer perfect and I had to search for something better.  Within the last year I've changed the format of my notebooks several times.  I've finally found something that works for ME.  However, the difference is that I'm not putting my system out there on a website.  Some folks here have asked me what I do and I've told them, in a simple post.  I don't know if anyone has adopted any of my ideas ... I don't actually care, except that I hope they found what they were looking for.  If anyone challenged something I said that I did, I'd say: "I do it this way because of this situation.  Do you see a better way?"  Who knows, I might hear of a better way.<br><br>In any case, resent me if you like, but I think you'd do well to not take it personally.  I don't.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Again Pete,<br><br>>>>  <We don't know for sure what habits are or how they really work.><br><br>Maybe, but we can understand them enough to make use of them.  <<<<br><br>I think that is true.  We know a lot about how to instill them and what might cause them to not "stick".  My observation was merely that we don't know enough to state WHAT they are with certainty.  And if one is defining something one has a duty to not go beyond what one knows.<br><br>I'm a very big proponent of habits.  I got a TON of flack on this very list for coming out in favor of focusing on changing habits.  <shudder>  Now it seems as if I'm on the other side?  Not really.  I'm just advocating not saying more than you can justify.<br><br>>>>  <No, I did not miss anything beyond what I said I missed. I'm at least sharp enough to know what I missed when I miss it!><br><br>Nobody can do that 100% of the time ;) <<<<br><br>I'll grant you that it is an iffy proposition.  However, with practice you get good at knowing what you heard and what you did not.<br><br>>>>  I actually think you're very intelligent.  <<<<br><br>Maybe so, maybe not.  I don't think it is as much about how intelligent anyone is but of the soundness of the argument.<br><br>I take thinking very seriously.  I tend to go way over the top (as most would see it) when someone makes an error in reasoning.  Such as not defining a term properly, or misusing a term, or any number of other things.  I do so because I feel that the only hope to understand things lies in the rigor of our thinking.  One thing I jump on is the use of extraneous terms and concepts that pop up for no reason.  So when I hear about "soft triggers" or "nails" or "nooses", I go nuts ;-)  There has to be a reason to introduce new terminology.  The new terms have to solve a problem.<br><br>In reading this stuff, over the years, I have observed that people introduce vague and redundant terms just to make their stuff appear different.  Sometimes the shift makes sense.  We used to talk about "goals".  Over the last few years the term has shifted to "outcomes".  Why?  Well, the first change was made by people who were trying to say something different.  "An outcome is not necessarily a goal."  But then the pod people picked it up, without understanding the distinction, and now it has become a redundant term, in most writing.  And that does nothing more than confuse thinking.<br><br>I get in an uproar because that kind of thing is the enemy of clear thought and progress in the understanding of our world.<br><br>But what the hell, I'm perhaps one of the few who cares about that kind of thing.<br><br>Another question ... Why am I here (on this forum)?  That is a good one.  I came here because Mark's ideas appeared to be new and interested me.  Over the last year and a half, I realized that his systems don't work for me.  I wish they did, but they don't.  It took me a while to figure out why, and a lot of work as well, but now I know why the simple prioritized To Do list is what I need.  But that begs the question ... why am I still here?<br><br>I've been asking that of myself more and more.  I note that many of those whom I've come to know and like have "retired", to use other systems or mixtures of systems.  I am mostly here out of habit, or a vague curiosity, or because some of my "friends" hang out here.  But less and less.  Things change.  This list has become "cool".  There is not much interesting talk any longer.  The ratio of SPAM to serious posts has changed for the worse.  A few of the people I really chat with I now chat with in private email, or sometimes on my own spin-off mail list.  (Feel free to engage me on any topic over on:<br><br>Philosophical_Ideas-subscribe@yahoogroups.com  )<br><br>It may be time for me to call it a day.  I'm getting so much less from this list that it is hardly worth checking it.  I don't think I'm being of much help to others here either.  Once in a while someone posts an interesting link.  But lately not so much.  The last time I followed a link it got me into this flap.  <sigh>  Mostly, I have better things to do than tell people why the great NEW idea they have is not NEW at all.  And, as you've seen, they resent it when I do.<br><br>What's that old expression?  "Never try to teach a pig to dance -- you'll fail and it only annoys the pig."  (or words to that effect)  LOL ;-)<br><br>So forgive me if I don't check back too often.  If I do, I'll respond to direct questions but perhaps not volunteer much any more.</div>

<div class="content">@ Erik<br><br>I perfectly understand your energy approach.  I went through a similar hospital experience 5 years ago.  I'm better now but I have residual chronic health problems and I also get older so I have enough physical energy for only 1-3 hrs a day and mostly in the morning but not before 9-10 am.  Mornings are also the best for any creative work and since I'm a scientist this is of a great importance. And then is a family with some members requiring very special attention on a moments notice.<br><br>Your system helped me change the way I think about my day and energy and I have read many books about time management so far.<br><br>Keep doing the great work.<br><br>@ White Swan<br><br>Your story is a great inspiration to me.<br><br>@ Mike<br><br>Some of what you say is a constructive criticism.  Most, however, it's just picking words apart.  I personally don't care for it.<br><br> Mark and his AF system started a transformation of my time management but it was Erik that really gave me wings.  And I'm a life-long workaholic who just had hard time realizing that time and energy are finite resources that no amount of self-discipline is going to increase.<br>I can try and push myself to work physically beyond my daily limit. There are two possible outcomes.  Either my body will refuse to cooperate after 1 hr (and this is a better scenario) or it will let me continue beyond 3 hrs but I will suffer for a week after.  All physical work has to be chunked up.  I can't clean my house in one go no matter how dirty it is and even when the company is coming.  It has to be scheduled one time block at a time and sticky kitchen floor or not it can even be on my list but when I'm done for a day, I'm done.<br>And I have money to buy some services like cleaning but little patience to deal with it in practice. I tried.</div>

Their purpose is to CUT though the fog of irrational and vague feelings and musings about things.  But since they are sharp, if you don't use them very carefully, you'll wind up cutting yourself.<br><br>Take it FWIW.</div>

<div class="content">Pete,<br><br>I think I've explained what I do several times.  Probably a different way each time as initially I was trying to use the various AF systems.<br><br>In a nutshell:<br><br>- Everything goes into a Grass Catcher notebook (a Composition style book) to start with.  (It has a semi hard back and lies flat and has no spiral to catch on things.  I have a couple of plastic paper clips to mark the last page and such.  There are a couple of other things I do with that book but that is too detailed for this presentation and they change nothing essential.<br><br>- In the morning I scan my list and select what I want to do.  (On my weekly planning day I select what I want to do for the week so I usually have a weeks worth of things already queued and prioritized and I'll select from that list.  I use a modified A,B,C / Q1-Q4 system.  IOW, I first note the urgency and importance and then after that prioritize the result.  Much of the time the "quadrant" is not something I do explicitly, but rather I just kind of "note" it mentally.  IOW, most of it is obvious to me.<br><br>- I put a few items onto a Hot List  (Usually a yellow Post-It) -- whatever I need to do that day.  I write them in the format "Task (Project Area: Project)" so that I am reminded why I'm doing it.  Ex: "Look up Shore Excursions (Enjoyment: Vacation).   I have five "project areas" to my life (for some reason that has never changed over the decades).  Things like "health", "finance", "enjoyment", etc.  They were initially a result of my first Alan Lakein exercise.  I took several weeks to work out my life's priorities many years ago and the "areas" were the obvious major groupings.  Over the years, nothing fundamental has changed.  So under the "area" of "enjoyment" I have the specific project "summer vacation" and under that, I have various tasks to make it happen.  Thus when I see a task I see the whole reason for it and so my motivation is there in front of me.  I don't have a disembodied task in floating in my face that I have no inclination to do.<br><br>- I prioritize the final list of items (by number 1-n, and I try to keep the size to at least 3 and less than 10).  Obviously, the number depends on the size of the tasks, how much else is going on, etc.<br><br>- I do them<br><br>Usually I'll block time for some of the items.  If it is something like "Do Laundry" I'll not schedule it.  I'll just start laundry when I'm doing something else and tend it as I work on other things.  If it "Read Bateson Essay", I'll block an hour or two for it and schedule it into a time slot during the day where I know I'm not likely to be interrupted.<br><br>Much of my "stuff" is habit.  I don't put "Planning" on my list because I do it every Sunday over coffee with my neighbor.  I don't have "Meditate" or "Eat Breakfast" or "Exercise" on my list because those are habits.<br><br>I don't do contexts.  I don't do "Zen", I don't do GtD.  None of that makes any sense to me or it makes sense but is so obvious that I don't pay attention to it as a part of my system.  One of my big principles it not to solve problems I don't have.  I don't have a "go to bed" or "wake up" because waking up is a habit and I go to bed when I'm tired (which is a function of when I wake up.)  I know I'm more alert in the morning so I just know to schedule thinking tasks then.  I don't need a system to tell me that ... I KNOW it.<br><br>I keep two small notebooks in my pocket with a break in half pen in the spirals.  One is 3x5 and is for lists of various kinds.  When I'm out it serves as my "capture" or Grass Catcher and is later transferred to my main Grass Catcher book.  My Hot List for today is usually a yellow Post-It in the cover of that book so it will be on my person at all times.<br><br>My second book is a 4x6 spiral and I use it as a log.  I record phone conversations, and other "non list" kinds of things.<br><br>That is pretty much all there is to it.  I don't perpetually scan the Grass Catcher (which used to be my AF 1-4 list).  I only look at it once a day.<br><br>Oh, and I've been trying to perfect a way to get this all on my iPhone.  So far I'm trying a combination of PI and Toodledo.  It looks promising but it still needs tweaking to make it seamless.<br><br>Finally, note that this works for me because of my personal context.  When I was in the computer biz, I had all kinds of tracking and planning sheets in ring binders.  Life in the computer world had special needs to track and log things ... much CYA going on all the time.  I don't live in that world any longer so I ditched all of the systems I had in place for that world.  Broke my heart, but I had to move on ;-)<br><br>Oh yeah, and two more things:<br><br>1) Coming from the Lakein system I set lots of goals and got into the habit of updating my goals periodically.  Goals form the basis of everything I do.  Only after tasks leading to goals have been addressed do I deal with the "maintenance" demand items.<br><br>2) I've been learning more and more about the importance of self-discipline in this.  I'm no longer trying to find a system to make things "easy" or "fun" or whatever.  I am acknowledging that many things I need to do just SUCK and that is TOO BAD ... they need to be DONE ANYWAY and no system is going to make them NOT SUCK.  So if something is on my list of 3-10 items for that day I know it has been put there because it needs to be done and that is the end of the discussion.  I don't examine my "energy" or how the planets are aligned ;-)  I just do it.<br><br>Lastly (really this time) I'm not saying that any part of this is YOUR system.  It is MY system and you can pick what you like from it ... or ignore all of it.  Your choice.  Enjoy.</div>
