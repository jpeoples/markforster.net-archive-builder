<div class="content">Has anyone tried using the application, My Life Organized, as a time management system?  If so, what are your thoughts?</div>

<div class="content">I believe it was modeled in part after LifeBalance which I used for a while before my Palm V broke.  LifeBalance described below:<br><br>The concept is you organize all your activities into categories and subcategories using an outline.  So everything you need to do is put into this tree.  It handles appointments and recurring items transparently.<br><br>Then the software automatically generates a list of things to do based on categories you've been ignoring, activities you've avoided, due dates, etc.  <br><br>That list feels like an Autofocus open list in that you constantly look at it, different things pop onto it, and you regularly choose things to work on.<br><br>Bottom line: It works, it's fun, it's easy.  Dangers include getting lost  setting up the task tree, getting lost trying to get the priorities right, and having tasks hidden in the tree that get forgotten.  <br><br>It has its own way of pulling up tasks to work on though so although it works with GTD, I think it conflicts with AutoFocus type systems which demand closed lists.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark - Alan describes MLO very eloquently. I think there have been other discussion in this forum about it so you might want to do a search. The developer has said he uses AF himself, so he has incorporated a few AF-friendly functions in the latest beta. Do check it out at the MLO forum.<br><br>I found it difficult to use MLO for AF, but seems to work extremely well with DWM. I group the tasks by due date and work through them according to the rules. Parsing makes re-entries a real breeze. Other benefits includes those that are common to typical electronic implementations - ability to hyperlink to other tasks and websites, make notes on the progress of your task, etc.<br><br>The software is very fast and lightweight and great for capturing all your notes and web text quickly.</div>

<div class="content">For those who are interested, here's a screenshot of my DWM set up in MLO captured in MS Word. <br><br><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2532858/DWM%20on%20MLO.doc" rel="nofollow">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2532858/DWM%20on%20MLO.doc</a><br><br>The due dates are collapsible, thus giving the impression of turning the pages of a diary (with the benefit of skipping the empty pages!)</div>

<div class="content">And more to the point, I'm loving DWM, having never had success with the AFs.</div>

<div class="content">MLO is a great program, good for all AF/DWM - the caveat is that if you want to use the Windows Mobile version you have to use ActiveSync, which can be problematic. That's why I moved to ListPro which uses the same file on the PDA and PC and doesn't need ActiveSync.</div>
