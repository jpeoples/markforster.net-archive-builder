<div class="content">I just wanted to say a huge thank you for giving us AF4, Mark. I drifted out of using AF1 last year (and funnily enough my effectiveness went down!) but started again with AF4 at the start of Jan.<br><br>One huge bonus so far is arranging to have eye laser surgery - something I've been "meaning" to do for years. This really will be a life-changing consequence of using the system!<br><br>I don't know what it is but whenever I have a free moment I just relish getting my list out and seeing what I can get ticked off.  And the excitement when I'm nearing being able to draw a new line - ooh!!  I love that division that AF4 has.<br><br>I'm a mother of young children and overseeing a big house build project, as well as a part time hypnotherapist.  One thing I find is I'm able to really enjoy being with my kids more because I'm free of the stress of worrying that I "should" be doing something else - AF4 is taking care of that.<br><br>And it's thanks to the system that I'm actually getting round to posting this.  So thanks again :-)<br><br>Lucinda</div>

<div class="content">Guess what Lucinda: just as you are beginning to enjoy the life-altering benefits of AF, even bigger things are around the corner with Mark's new system. <br><br>So glad things are working out your you. Your description sounds so much like the kind of release and freedom I enjoyed when I first used AF. Now, I just feel contented and secure. Through the wildest days and all sorts of crazy schedules, even having to abandon the list for a while running pillar to post, AF is like an oasis of calm.</div>
