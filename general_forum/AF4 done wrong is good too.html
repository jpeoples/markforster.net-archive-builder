<div class="content">I'm a big fan of Mark's suggestion to try the instructions as written for a while -- before coming up with a list of all the reasons the system won't work.  So I read through the AF4 instructions, watched the PDF demo, and struck out on my own for a week.<br><br>Scenario:  I started with my 47 page list built from AF1 onwards.  I'm uncomfortable with the length of the list, but I'm comfortable with my intuition telling me when something needs to be done.  The week was extremely productive, and I did (or crossed off) a lot of backlog items.  And I'm down to 40 pages.  But...<br><br>I've been operating the system backwards.  I make one pass through the closed list, then loop through the open list doing doing doing until nothing stands out.  Then I return to make a single pass through the closed list.  This procedure made sense to me during the week.  Give more attention to the recently-added/possibly urgent stuff and less attention to the backlog.  Now I have to go away again for a week and operate the system as written to see how that goes.<br><br>My only question is... should I read the discussions now?  Maybe they hold vital info... or maybe they'd help me form preconceptions before I get experience.  Ayiieee.<br><br>In any case, it must be a great productivity system that works so well even if you do it wrong.  Thanks Mark.</div>

<div class="content">What you did looks a lot like AF3 ended up being fo most of us : cycling several times through the end of the list, then go sometimes to the beginning of the list. only the dismissal rules differ.<br>I totally agree that it can be an appropriate custom solution for some of us.<br>I am pretty sure that we should be able able to switch from one AF mode to the other according to the situation, whether one has a lot of items this week, or more time to bring forward old stuff.<br>In AF4, I still miss the "advancing-every-day-dismissal-line". I am thinking about merging AF1 or AF2/3 dismissal rules with AF4, until the closed list is short enough to be treated as a unit.<br><br>Let us know where your experiments lead you to !<br><br>Alex</div>

<div class="content">I was doing so well with AF2 I missed AF3 completely.  Now that I've read up on it, I see what you mean -- nice observation.  I didn't have any dismissals since the lists were so long, and I was doing so much.  Although the oldest pages are from February, so I've been pretty agressive crossing stuff off.  I'll report on what happens.</div>

<div class="content">Slothbear:<br><br>I think it's a bit much to expect any new system to be able to cope with forty-seven pages of backlog. I've decided to change the Backlog name to Closed List precisely because I didn't want that to happen.<br><br>AF4 is designed to process your active work. If you have stuff which hasn't been touched since February, then by no stretch of the imagination can that be called active work.<br><br>I would strongly advise you to start off a fresh list. Just write a short list of the things you are currently working on, and add to it as things come up in the course of work.</div>

<div class="content">Agreed -- perhaps that is why my misinterpretation of the process worked so well.  I was mostly focused on active work (the open list), and the closed list acted more as a someday/maybe list.  <br><br>My work style and responsibilities are different from most.  After I get the urgent stuff done, I have a lot of discretionary time.  The intuitive approach of all Autofocus systems has worked well for me.<br><br>As a big fan of trying the system as written, I'll start a fresh list today as you suggest.  Many thanks.</div>

<div class="content">Mark - glad to see you back.<br><br>For what it's worth, I started AF4 with my whole list that I've continued to use since AF1.  When I started AF4, I probably had 1500+ tasks and 60-70 open pages.  Although it has been a bit sluggish at times, nonetheless AF4 is still the most effective AF system yet for actually getting through all this, while still staying (mostly) on top of the most urgent things.  (And all the AF systems have been better than anything else I've ever tried.)<br><br>I considered "starting over" but since I knew my list would be up to the 700+ task count in a matter of days anyway, I thought I'd go ahead and do a good stress test and see if AF4 could handle my old list.  By my 7th day with AF4, I had closed about 75% of the tasks on the Closed List, having taken action on most of them and deleted the rest.  <br><br>I still have about 200 tasks on my Closed List, and my Open List has grown to 17 pages long.  Even so, I am able to cycle through the Closed List several times per day, and the Open List generally at least twice.  (As long as I don't have days full of meetings.)   I'm really getting a lot done, and finishing off that closed list is finally in sight.  And at least half of the tasks on the Open List have been completed.<br><br>AF3 was "faster" as far as responding to urgent things.  But urgency began to completely dominate, at the expense of importance.<br><br>With AF4, it's still pretty responsive to urgency, but the focus on importance has returned.</div>

<div class="content">My list isn't as long as Seraphim's, but I do have items that have been hanging around since Feb or Mar.  I have about 155 items spread over 18 pages right now.  AF4 is helping me work through them better than any of the previous iterations.  My discretionary time comes and goes in cycles which explains the length of time that some items have hung around.  But the fact that I have been keeping with the system says a lot for the overall concepts that tie all the versions together.<br><br>My productivity has gone way up.  More importantly, I don't feel like everything is out of control.  It's all in the book.</div>

<div class="content">Re: "It's all in the book."  LOL ;-)   One problem I experience is that it is all in the book, sometimes multiple times.  I often don't remember if I wrote it down and it takes so long to scan the list to look for it that I simply write it again.  No problem, it just gets crossed off twice... or more ;-)</div>

<div class="content">AF4 is great and I'm waiting for AF7 ;-)<br><br>My productivity went up with every new version of AF and my to-do lists were shrinking. Before AF I always had 200-250 items on my to-do list at least, with AF1 it went down to around 130, with AF2 to around 110, with AF3/RAF to 80/90 and now with AF I'm at approx. 60 items (and scattered across less active pages, 5-6 normally).<br><br>If I extrapolate this, AF7 will do the work by itself…<br>Mark, hang in there! ;-)<br><br>Seriously: Mark, thank you very much for your system and for your continuous improvements! If I can be of any help with the German translation of the instructions, let me know (will send you a separate email on this).<br><br>Christian<br></div>
