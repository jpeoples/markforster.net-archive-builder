<div class="content">Hoping to introduce AF to more people. I placed the video on Facebook and on Barbara Sher's boards. <br><br>Oh, and it should be on your VIEWING list. No reading necessary!</div>

<div class="content">Same thing in my case - using Firefox's excellent Your Reading List add-on.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>Is the Firefox extension actually called "Read It Later"?  I couldn't find one called "Your Reading List".  <br><br>I have been using Evernote for this and it is good in some ways but sometimes feels too cumbersome.  So I am open to other ideas.</div>

<div class="content">Marty:<br><br>Actually I'm not sure. It says "Your Reading List" at the top of the list, but I can't see anything which says what the extension is actually called.</div>

<div class="content">If the icon is a brown book with a yellow ribbon, then it is Read It Later.</div>

<div class="content">"I use OfficeTime basically every day!"<br><br>Purchasing it this afternoon. <br><br>Having settled on AF 2, and software to complement it, I've lost interest in the evolution of Autofocus. Personally, Mark's kernel of truths i.e. intuition, little and often and dismissal is all I really need.</div>
