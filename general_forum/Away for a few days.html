<div class="content">C'est très intérresant. Je peux comprendre tous vos mots, même avec des «,istqkes»!<br><br>I suggest you continue to just type away, as if it's your standard keyboard. The results will at least be amusing.  :-)</div>

<div class="content">Now I really am back, and thankfully on a UK English keyboard.<br><br>Though actually I learned to type on a German keyboard - z is one of the most common letters and y is one of the least common so they change places.<br><br>So you'll realiye that it's reallz easz compared with the French kezboard.</div>
