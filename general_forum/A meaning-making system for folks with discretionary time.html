<div class="content">THE RULES<br><br>1. Take 2 pieces of blank paper (I use a Levernger Circa - Junior size)<br><br>2. Write today's date at the top of both<br><br>3. On one sheet, commit to a task, action or intention i.e. Meditate for ten minutes or Work on final chapter of book or Contemplate baking hash brownies<br><br>4. Write today's time next to the task/action/intention<br><br>5. The other sheet serves as a scratch pad for any thoughts, tasks… anything that comes up while you fulfill the commitment (to yourself) vis-a-vis the task you choose in step 3<br><br>6. Work on task for as long as you feel like it<br><br>7. When you're ready to move on, commit to something else, and write that beneath the task you just completed<br><br>Repeat steps 3 through 7 whenever you have discretionary time.<br><br>I value the thinking and creativity of this virtual community, and hope you can provide suggestions/changes, etc. My goal is to create an analog system that:<br><br>* Provides a narrative of how my day went - both in thinking, feeling and action<br><br>* Respects the idea that, in the moment, we know what we want or need to do (whatever that may be)<br><br>* Encourages mindfulness & discipline by choosing an activity - whatever it may be - and writing it down (committing to it)<br><br>* Lowers anxiety by capturing any niggling thing that's on my mind, in the moment, to be reflected on whenever I deem necessary<br><br>* Supports spontaneity by choosing an activity without relying on lists (unless I CHOOSE to glance at my scratch pad, etc)<br><br>* Pulls together daily activity - ideas, tasks, fears, sketches - to form an attractive piece of nostalgia <br><br>Feedback?</div>

<div class="content">I like the flexibility in type and scope of commitment. That worked very well during the accountability group experiment.<br><br>My first reaction was, "combine them into one page, using a border or highlighter to set off the commitment, and do it in the Everything book." Then I remembered how well keeping a separate report on commitments worked during the accountability experiment.<br><br>I'd add the option for a short commitment chain. A reward (after I do this, I can work on my current obsession), or time limit (gotta get this done before my appointment), or reassurance (won't forget there are other important things on my list). I find those sometimes help keep me focused.<br><br>Is the second page only for the current project, or is it a catch-all?<br><br>Part of me says the system is easy to start. Grab some paper. The other part is looking at all the excuses I have not to start. And the other part is saying, "See, you even used the word excuses! Go clean the breakfast dishes, a bit at a time."<br><br>(PS. Surgery was Friday. Currently doing well, but no stamina. Also see two weeks' of undone maintenance (trouble focusing the week before), and things put off until "after surgery", and family home, and traveling. Like I said, no reason not to putter around until half my energy is gone, then rest.)<br><br>Serendipity. You mentioned Levenger Jr. I have an empty one on the shelf. One excuse, gone. Kitchen, beware. (Deadline: Husband promised to cook supper.)</div>

<div class="content">Instant failure. Went into brain dump mode. Relabeled that page as part of the big list, and started a new "current commitment" page.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Cricket<br><br><<My first reaction was, "combine them into one page>><br><br>My suggestion for two pages, one as a scratch pad, the other for commitments, would be akin to a painter's tool kit: (a) a palette to mix paint (b) canvass for the painting. Over time, you want to have two narratives: 1. Pages that reflect your stream of consciousness i.e. feelings, tasks, observations, etc 2. Pages that reflect your commitments - structured, linear, etc. <br><br><<I'd add the option for a short commitment chain>><br><br>Sure, if that works for you. Personally, I'd prefer the chain to reflect wherever my mind/mood is at at that given time. If it's web-surfing, after web-surfing, so be it. So long as I write it down, and bring some mindfulness to my activity. <br><br><<Is the second page only for the current project, or is it a catch-all?>><br><br>A catch-all for anything that comes up as you're tackling the committed task/activity <br><br><<PS. Surgery was Friday. Currently doing well>><br><br>A speedy recovery to you!<br><br>And thanks so much for the feedback.</div>

<div class="content">So far so good with the above rules/workflow. I've created daily journal pages to go along with the rules. If you'd like to try 'em, email me at avrum AT nadigel DOT com</div>

<div class="content">Avrum, <br>I am going to give this System a try.  I happen to have a hardbound NotePro lined notebook, called Blueline, I think that will work.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Brenda. <br><br>Great - curious to hear your thoughts. I've been using this for appx a week, so I'd be glad to share what a completed day looks like. I'm still ironing out the aesthetics --> ways to ensure a completed daily commitment page reads like a story vs a list of completed (zzzzzzzzzz) tasks.</div>

<div class="content"><<3. On one sheet, commit to a task, action or intention>><br><br>I've been toying with an idea where one taps into what is "best in you"** as inspiration for rule #3. Which begs the question: Am I able to spot the difference between "the best" and "the worst" in me? Now, the worst in me I know, quite intimately. The best however... <br><br>In Dreams - Mark coaches the reader to script an idea day/life as a force to inspire and pull. Similarly, I'm wondering how I could tap into past experience to create a working model of what is "best in me." If I were able to get a good picture of what that has looked like, than I could use that as a trigger to inspire "best in me" daily commitments (step 3). And then I could make a couple of notes on what happened i.e. Did I fulfill the commitment? Why or why not? Do I need to refine my "best in me" definition? Change a tool? Location? <br><br>If you have anything to add, I'd love to hear about it. <br><br>** I'm borrowing "best/worst in you" from Dr. David Schnarch - sex/marriage therapist and author</div>
