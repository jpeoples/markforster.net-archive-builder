<div class="content">I see nothing wrong with it, so long as you are happy to work on it when it stands out, rather than feeling it needs to be worked on within a prescribed time. But in contrast to the AF1 point, we have:<br><br>Mark, Nov 9:<br><br><<It's important with AF4 that you don't use too long a list.

<div class="content">I add everything to the list.  But I don't keep everything there forever.<br><br>AutoFocus pulls me forward to consider each task in turn.  When I consider a new task, I either commit to it, file it, or delete it.<br><br>If I decide not to do (or think about) it soon, it gets booted:  I file it with a project, or I put it on a Maybe Later list, or I delete it.<br><br>When I commit to a task, I either do it, or determine the next action, or start planning it as a project, with a 3 word purpose statement and tasks to be pulled in.  [Okay, so tasks belonging to a project might not go on my list until I'm ready for them, which is usually when a previous task is complete.]</div>

<div class="content">Laurence:<br><br>Yes, I'm surprised that comment by Mark didn't get more attention, as it's a significant and (I think) unheralded change of approach. Mark was quite explicit initially – at least with AF1 and AF2 – that one of the big advantages of the system was supposed to be that you could throw anything at it, that you didn't need to, and indeed *shouldn't* do any evaluating of tasks before adding them to the list. The weeding out was all supposed to come later. So this is a big change, it seems to me.</div>

<div class="content">I don't think too much has changed with AF4. Even with AF1 I found that, yes you can throw anything at it, but it's usually not worth it. There are two main disadvantages. The first is that you loose some of the review effect of dismissal. Dismissal still helps you to regain focus. When you dismiss something, you can evaluate what went wrong. But if your list consists not only of things you want to work on now, but everything you might or could do, nothing really went wrong and dismissing a good portion of the tasks is to be expected. The second problem is that you cannot realistically clear out your backlog/your old pages when they are full of maybe-tasks. This made dismissal a constant threat and I started to work 'tactically', i.e. working on something only to avoid dismissing. Some people find this effect helpful. Not I. Too often this led me to do something that was not really worth doing or to start something that would be dismissed eventually anyway. I would *loose* focus. Like Alan Baljeu I sometimes put ideas on my AF list, but then the first action on them is to move them somewhere else.</div>

<div class="content">Interesting posts, just recently I was throwing everything at the list, but decided now to edit the list down to size.  I think it is much more workable - I dropped many of the routine tasks that I would automatically re-add.  Now I add them only when I think of doing them.  I've been doing this for only about a week, but so far It cleaned up the list quite a bit and I think it added real clarity about what to do and a sense of accomplishment when they were completed.  It allowed for that intuitive sense that is so important for AF.  One task that I do add periodically is to go over a certain project or plan this or plan that.  Works great.</div>

<div class="content">I like a complete capture somewhere of all I would like to do ir consider doing, but it can be overwhelming to have it be on the list you work the most.  I like separate lists for projects I may consider in the future which I review at one sitting.  In the heat of battle is not always the best time to review things like consider starting an online business or write the next great novel.<br><br>Gerry<br><br><a href="http://simpletimemanagement.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://simpletimemanagement.blogspot.com/</a></div>

<div class="content">Yes, it's good to have lists like "Chores" (for example) which just exist for reference.  This list captures all those recurring tasks, and you only need look at the list periodically to decide if you want to do any soon.  Then add those to AF4.  The "Chores" list exists so you don't forget any.  Keeping the list separate ensures you don't worry every day about vacuuming your already clean living room.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Olaf,<br><br>If I understand you correctly, you're saying that there isn't such a big difference between AF4 the way you did AF1. That may be right; nonetheless, there has been a significant change in the way Mark recommends doing things (from no evaluation prior to adding an item to the list to pre-evaluation), and I'm surprised that didn't occasion more comment, especially given the emphasis Mark placed on the no-pre-evaluation aspect of things in the early versions of AF.</div>

<div class="content">If I think of a task that needs to be done, and it's clear to me that it needs to be done LATER, and I have my tickler handy (i.e., Outlook tasks), then I just add the task and set the date and it's done.   When the task comes up in Outlook, I evaluate:  ready to do now?  (move to AF4)  or better later?  (postpone the date)  or maybe, just delete since you've realized it's not needed?   or not sure?  (maybe postpone, maybe ove to AF4 for sifting)<br><br>However, if a task comes to mind, and I don't want to think more about it right now, or Outlook isn't handy (computer is frozen or whatever), then I put it in AF4.   <br><br>When I come across a task in AF4 that I realize is just clogging up the works because I don't want to work on it any time soon, then I move it to the tickler, to appear again in a week or a month or whatever.<br><br>So, I think AF4 still functions just fine as a "catch everything" list -- as long as you remember you also can and should use a tickler as well.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim, that's exactly how I use AF4 now. Works very well, both for keeping track of stuff that's only relevant within a few weeks or months or whatever, and for keeping the list "lean and mean".</div>
<h2>Reply by Mark Forster</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-11-18 9:45</div>
<div class="content">Just to clarify my comment, the thing which really kills AF4 is starting off with a huge dump of tasks from earlier lists. That means that the initial closed list (backlog) takes weeks, or even months to clear. This is contrary to the intent behind the system which is that it should be fast-moving.<br><br>My recommendation is (and always has been for all versions of AF) that you should build the list up gradually by entering things as they come up. That way you ensure that the list is realistic and current and doesn't die of constipation.<br><br>Although it's possible to move directly into AF4 from previous versions without re-writing your list, that should only be done if the old list was lean and fast-moving. In other words if you were having a problem with the size of your list already, don't expect AF4 to solve it!<br><br>I've also always made the point that tasks which can't be done or don't need to be done over the next few days should not be put on the list but should be scheduled. The reminder should normally be to put the task on the list, but of course can be to do something at a specific time (e.g. call Bob at 10 a.m.)</div>

I recommend that you enter everything that comes to mind without trying to evaluate.

<div class="content">I simultaneously practice both the "Now" and "Originally" versions.<br><br>As I wrote before, I throw everything on the list.  Later, following the system, I evaluate things and move them to a calendar when appropriate.<br><br>Not pre-evaluating tasks makes the capture process so trivial that of course I will capture everything.  I immediately return to my workflow, and only consider the new tasks when I'm ready to think about them. [if it's important, I wrap up what I was doing and advance to it.  If it's not important, it could be hours before I examine it.]<br><br>Laurence, I think the "confrontational" concept is good.  Before automatically deferring something to a calendar, think hard whether "drop" or "hand off" is a better course of action.</div>

<div class="content">I actually logged on to the site today to ask something similar. Suddenly finding myself with too much free time (I know) and having to choose between a handful of self-employment options, I wondering about using AF to help clarify my desires.<br><br>My problem is that right now I WANT to do all my job options, but I recognize that I can't reasonably pursue them all (despite Mark's blog title!).<br><br>I remembered specifically Mark's example of putting many possible books to read on the list. It seems to me that the beauty of AF, as I understood it, was that tasks that you don't do get dealt with as tasks that for some reason you don't WANT to do--so you then decide if those tasks are indeed valuable.<br><br>In my case, I think that by putting everything on the list and seeing what actually gets done, it will help me narrow down my choices.<br><br>My specific question was: AF--a list of possible tasks, or a list of committed-to tasks? I know I'm free to use the system any way I'd like, but it's useful and interesting to hear what others think!<br><br>ds</div>

<div class="meta">2009-11-19 14:44</div>
<div class="content">Regarding "possible tasks", I say go for it.  <br><br>AutoFocus can help you get there.  Set up planning tasks, and plan out all your job options "little and often".  Then pursue the options you end up planning the most clearly.<br><br>Regarding "can't reasonably pursue them all", you may very well be right, but to you I strongly recommend reading "Refuse to Choose" by Barbara Sher.  Her thesis is that you *can* do everything you want to, and she explains strategies for getting there.  Whether or not everything is a paid position (also discussed in depth, how to create such careers), is up to you.</div>

<div class="content">Hi ds<br><br>If you try the system, you will probably find that what gets left in your Closed list is a combination of things you don't care about and things you care very much about and have been deferring thinking about, possibly for a long time.<br><br>I second Alan's comment above, and would add that if your possible plans involve creative work, remember you can downsize and work part-time. The three elements of modern life are space, time and money and they can all be juggled around.<br><br>A section from Mark's AF1 instructions may help:<br><br><<The system works by providing a framework which balances the rational and intuitive parts of the brain. . . . when these two ways of thinking are in balance we are able to make rational decisions which are fully in accord with our deeper feelings and emotions.>></div>

<div class="content">I started AF4 some time ago, and it was successful until now. I am indeed dumping in everything that comes to my mind.<br><br>My situation is this one: I have a day job as a programmer, I have two lovely low-age children, I am renting a big house, and I have a big backlog of things to do, mainly to address the maintenance problems of the house (chairs to repair, lightbulbs to change, etc.) and things related to the birth od the second one. My wife needs me to get both kids to the doctor at the same time, so when I'm back from work, I have lots of occasions to lose focus.<br><br>We have a team organisation at work (namely Kanban + Extreme Programming) so we keep reminding to one another where we are and what we need to do, so we don't see the use of yet another system.<br><br>I have started to use AF4 for home with an empty list, dumping in everything that came to mind. Then I closed the list and engaged the system. The first items that got striked-through (i.e. done) were the "draw-kill-sheath" ones. (Less that 5 minutes to do each) The ones requring a bit more of work were left into the closed list. The first pass where I processed none of the items in the closed list were things that could actually wait. I re-introduced some of them into the open list, some into a "Do later" list.<br><br>Now, I am concentrating on only some of the things in my backlog, doing one after the other. Both of my lists are actually reducing, even while processing the daily incoming tasks. I am working about one and a half hour on the list on weekdays, and three or four hours on saturdays. The list has 11 unprocessed items (4 closed/7 open) I have, in two weeks working like this, achieved more that the four previous motnhs combined.<br><br>What I find great with AF4 is that it's unifying the treatment of incoming items and in-progress items, and you can even "choose" when to think about them. (even wait until you are forced to) It reminds me a lot of the GTD Inbox, except that GTD forces you to take a decision right away, when you review your inbox.</div>

<div class="content">This really rang a bell for me.  When I left work more than a year and a half ago, I thought I'd get on with the things I'd always said I'd do when I had more time.  But once I really did have the time, guess what?  Most of them still haven't been started, let alone finished.  Examples are: sorting out all my photos, re-organising my CDs, cassettes etc., organising my official paperwork, getting round to reading all the novels in my bookcase, doing my jigsaws, experimenting with new recipes, using a calligraphy set, using a paintbox set, studying subjects I'm really interested in, etc. etc.  Having read the first chapter of 'Refuse to Choose' recommended in previous posts, I certainly recognise myself as a  bit of a Scanner, interested in many different things, and much better at starting something than finishing it.   However, the reason I don't do them is not that I am confused by too much choice, but  that I look on them as rewards for doing other, less tempting, tasks, and if I'm procrastinating on difficult projects or boring routine tasks, I won't allow myself the reward. <br><br>I've been using AF in its various forms since almost the beginning, and love it.  I've added these and other pleasurable things to the list, but so far I'm still in the mindset of thinking that I can only do something pleasurable once I've got the rest of my life sorted out.   That's not as drastic as it sounds, and I already do many, many pleasurable things, but has anyone else had a similar experience, and how have you dealt with it?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Margaret<br><br>I think the issue you face is pretty much exactly the same issue we all face in deciding what to take on.  I expect that most of us have many more options than we can possibly handle.  Somehow, we have to determine our priorities.<br><br>AF is a great help in sorting out what we are to do.  It can help us to keep a broad range of possibilities in view and it can help us to discern constantly during each day just what actions have real value for us.<br><br>I might add that the idea of using some activities as rewards for making an effort on others might have its dangers.  I tend to require each action to offer its own rewards.  (e.g. doing something irksome produces peace of mind; mopping the floor allows me to enjoy the comfort of a clean house....)<br><br>I think it does no harm to have a large number of items in the someday/maybe category.  But we need to remember that there must be limits to what we give energy to and that there is a real skill in discovering our true priorities.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jim, Yes, what you're saying about completed tasks bringing their own reward is very true.  Rather than using desirable activities as rewards, I should do them for their own sake, and not wait till I feel I've earned them.  It's not lack of time that hinders me, it's a streak of perfectionism that makes me think I can't dig out a jigsaw while there are cupboards that need clearing out - which is fine if I'd go and clear out the cupboards, but I procrastinate and do neither.  If only my perfectionism were more than a mere streak, I could use it to plough through the necessary work, then enjoy guilt-free pleasures.  Although I love Autofocus, I'm thinking about re-reading "Do it Tomorrow" and perhaps using a Will-do List to churn through the 'necessary but boring' work, then use AF4 for my remaining discretionary time, with "treats" sprinkled liberally through the AF4 list.    I think in earlier Autofocus threads, people had mentioned that they work this way, scheduling certain items for a specific timeblock, then reverting to AF for any remaining time.   All my time is discretionary, and in principle I like the concept of using AF4 for my whole day (which I think is what Mark does), but now I think I need to experiment with a more structured set-up.  As the saying goes, I'm self-employed, and I have a helluva lazy boss!  (Actually I'm not employed at all, self- or otherwise, but I love that saying).  I'd be interested to hear whether others use AF4 on a 24/7 basis or only for certain parts of their day.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Margaret,<br><br>Mixing Do It Tomorrow and AF does not appeal to me.  My fear is that I would do neither properly.  <br><br>You might like to consider using a timer if you are are inclined to lose focus.  I have found that the use of a timer does not undermine any of the basic principles of AF.  In fact it does help me to avoid one of my main traps: spending too long on items of lesser importance.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-11-23 10:33</div>
<div class="content">Thanks, Jim.  You're probably right about the danger of mixing the two methods, and ending up doing neither properly.   It might be better to stick to using Autofocus, but instead of using it 24/7, allocate certain times of the day for necessary tasks that I look on as 'work', then to use AF4 for the remainder of the day, making sure that the AF4 list contains plenty of fun stuff.<br><br>I'll give the timer a try again - in the past I've used Mark's method (from the Get Everything Done and Still Have Time to Play book)  of doing several tasks in ever-increasing bursts of time, and it works brilliantly.  It makes even boring tasks fun, but I'm not sure how to tie it in with the Autofocus recommendation of doing a task 'for as long as I feel like'.  Perhaps I should use the 'bursts'  method for the non-AF4 section of my day, then when I'm using AF4, follow the rules.<br><br>Thanks again for your advice - much appreciated.  This is a great forum, and it's so interesting to hear how others implement Autofocus.  Best wishes to Mark as well - hope you're enjoying your retirement.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Margaret<br><br>The instruction for Autofocus (from the current September 5, 2009 version of the rules) says, "when you feel you have worked on it long enough".  Well there are times when for a host of reasons I might well say that 5 minutes is exactly long enough.  Hence, I see no problem in incorporating a series of bursts of work into AF.<br><br>Like you, I have memories of how effective and satisfying time bursts can be when I need some external help to keep me focussed.  I say if a method makes you productive and satisfied freely use it.  It is not against either the letter or the spirit of the "rules".</div>

<div class="content">Thanks again, Jim.  What I've decided to do is to use AF4 all day, rather than doing daily recurring tasks outside AF4, and I think I've found a way of actioning them by using a combination of the Pomodoro technique and increasing bursts of time, but hopefully still within the AF4 rules.   The important thing is that I add these tasks at the end of each day (and therefore at the end of the (open) list) so that they are next to each other: Housework, Paperwork, Record-keeping. <br><br>Then next morning I start working the AF4 list at the point I left off the previous day, and I usually find myself moving quickly to those three items at the end of the list, and I feel ready to do them.   I work on each for 5 minutes, then for 10 minutes, then for 15 minutes, rotating round each one until the particular task is complete or I feel I've done enough of that task for that day. At that point I carry on as normal with AF4.  (I also use the Pomodoro technique of having a 5-minute leisure break at the end of each 25-minutes' worth of work,  to add to the fun).  <br><br>I find it more satisfying to work on the three tasks as a unit using the 'bursts' method, as it keeps me more focused on getting them done for the day (so that they are off my plate and I don't feel them nagging at me) than if I were using normal AF4 rules.  If I were using normal AF4 rules and working on each item then re-adding it, they would end up interspersed with other unrelated tasks that came into my mind and were added to the list, which is what's been happening up till now, and which I've found demotivating.  So in a way I'm taking the three tasks off the AF4 list temporarily and concertrating on them, and it feels less messy than if I worked the bursts method on three items that were not near each other on the list, which I feel would be 'cheating'.  <br><br>I'll let you know how it goes.  If it's successful, I may try using it with some of my Projects, which are also starving for lack of concentrated focus.  Maybe I'm kidding myself that this is all within AF4 rules, but maybe you and others can let me know what you think.<br><br>Best wishes to all.</div>
