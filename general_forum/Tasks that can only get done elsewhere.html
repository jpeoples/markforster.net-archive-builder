<div class="content">Supposed I put a task on my list "buy new pen". To be able to buy a new pen, I have to be in town. As I am at home and have a lot to do, this task remains surrounded by a lot of other tasks I get done while being at home. Then what? Dismiss "buy new pen" and switch to the next page?<br><br>Isn't it necessary to have separate lists for separate, well, "contexts", as GTD says? Not that I find GTD useful, but the concept of contexts is true.<br><br>I'd create another list "CITY", where I assemble everything that has to be done there. Am I making things unnecessary complicated? Any comments welcome!</div>

<div class="content">Hi,<br>when it comes to errands out on the town, especially if it concerns locations and places I don't pass by that often, I would put it on a separate list. <br><br>Just like you would do with your groceries list – just doesn't make sense to have them scattered around in your autofocus list! :-)<br><br>Otherwise I just use just one list, for work and home. (I know I can easily be distracted into using half a zillion GTD-like contexts, so I try to restrain myself.)<br><br>However, I have two contexts, kind of. Still in my "master" autofocus list; <br><br>– I put an H (for Home) before tasks that only can be done at home (I'm basically always at work and once I am home I don't to be reminded of all the work related items)<br><br>– I'm also experimenting with using a "mental" context; I put a $-sign before business tasks that "bring in the money" (it's mostly boring business admin stuff like invoicing - has to be done though!) The $-sign reminds me to put myself in biz admin role/mode every once in a while, and batch those tasks.<br><br>/jonaz</div>

<div class="content">Hi Roland<br><br>It sounds as if you may have some confusion over when to move to the next page.  You do not have to complete or dismiss all items on a page before moving on to the next.  You only have to do one or more tasks in order to move on.  It is only if no tasks at all stand out on the *first* pass of any active page that you dismiss all remaining tasks.  Therefore, by the time you reach the point of dismissal, you will probably have been to town so many times that the item should be dismissed because you obviously don't really want to buy it or you would have done so! :-)<br><br>You may find some of the posts in the FAQ thread helpful<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/645945" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/645945</a><br><br></div>

<div class="content">I understood that I just have to attack at least one item on a page to keep the rest from being dismissed, yes. However, I think it's best to use the "grocery list"-approach: I will maybe add "buy new pen" to the master list, and the first action might be to move the task into a special register in my calendar book (that one has to have besides as well, for time-related tasks).<br><br>This way, I don't have to decide beforehand where to write something down. It's always the end of the "master list" – so, no need to waste a second of brain time.<br><br>BTW, I live far from the next city and go there usually one time per month at the most, so I am already used to gather lists of things to do there all at once... My question was just to clarify for myself how that habitude fits into the AF system.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Roland<br><br>I use exactly that approach - when I think of something I need to buy I write the task as "add x to shopping list".  The task is completed when I add it to the list and all I need to do is to print the list before I go shopping, which I could also add to the AF list if it was really necessary :-)</div>

<div class="content">Roland, if you're interested... <br><br>There is a - paper-based - organizer system that suits the AutoFocus approach perfectly, IMHO. It's called X47 (don't have a link at hand, just google or ask in case of doubt), and I use it in a configuration that consists of 4 parts: <br><br>1. a calendar (one week per double-page: 7 days plus space for time-critical tasks that have to be done in this week, but not on a specific day)<br><br>2. a notebook: which can be used for the AutoFocus "master list"<br><br>3. a "database", a kind of notebook with tabbed sections: which can be used for "grocery lists"<br><br>4. an adress book (where I note not only adresses, but everything else I need to have at hand,  like dress sizes, code numbers of printer refill sets, my tax number, opening hours of stores, important customer numbers etc.)<br><br>I used to use it in conjunction with a computer-based project planner, but this feeled always like too much overhead, so I am about to switch to the AutoFocus system, using my X47 in the way described above.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the hint! This is awesome; seems to be exactly what I was looking for. I have to check this out somewhere. Looks as if you can easily take one notebook out and insert a new one once it's full: How great is that?<br><br>I am asking myself whether there are some business connections between the makers of X47 and Mark Forster... As far as I see, not. (But might be a good idea?)</div>

<div class="content">Interesting! Too bad they only have sites in German and French (but a splash screen in English..?)<br><br>Guess I'll have to brush up my French and German ;-)<br><br></div>

<div class="content">I have two ways of handling "errands".  First, I have two AF lists: work & home.  At the end of work, I check my home list.  If a purchase or other errand "stands out" from the list, I do it before leaving town or en route home.<br><br>The other option is to consolidate several errands and schedule them on my calendar - outside my AF list.  I especially use this for errands that aren't on my commute route or must be done on the weekend.</div>

<div class="content">I am using a myx17 for my list and for notes. Two sections are for the list, two for notes. If the second list section is full, i can remove the first list section (hopefully everything in that section is already done), move it to the first place and enter a new one on the second place. So no need to transcribe entries into a new notebook, once the old one is full.<br><br>I own the DIN A5 version and i use squared paper, so i can use it in portrait mode for my list. Perfect for 32 entries and still very portable.<br><br>The only drawback is, it does not look as noble as a Moleskine, a Leuchturm or the X47 notebook. Might be a problem in a business / customer context. But for private / internal use it is perfect.<br></div>

<div class="content">@Roland:  I think David Alen said: it is all about lists. A calendar is just a special list.<br><br>I am using several lists. One for my job, one for my private life, different shopping lists, a travel list, and a calendar.<br><br>The first two lists and my calendar are my master lists. I am using them when i am in the right context. I reference the other lists in my master lists with entries like 'check ..', 'plan ...', 'enter into ...'. Works perfect. No need to add @context, or @date or other meta information.</div>

<div class="content">OMG, the x47 is a thing of beauty!!  <br>They don't appear to deliver to North America however?  If anybody knows if they do or if there's a North American equivalent, could you please let me know?  What an awesome "Christmas present to self" for next year when I think my current book will be complete.</div>

<div class="content">For the original errands question, I write it down on my AF list along with everything else, fit them in during the week after work as appropriate.  Whatever's left over, I consolidate onto a post-it note and do them back to back on Saturday afternoon.  In other words, I use the order of the pages when it makes sense to do so, and leave it when it makes sense as well.</div>

<div class="content">Andreas, you are being unnecessarily cruel !   :-)  I'm having a severe case of planner/notebook-envy right now.  I tried ordering online, but they don't seem to have an online cart, what I thought was on online cart - wasn't.  The google translate doesn't seem to work for the detailed pages, I'll have to translate words individually, I think or copy into a word document and try to translate that.  Another AF task has been added to do just that - thanks Seraphim!<br>What do y'all use for fillers?  I use the work online calendar system for work, so only need a monthly calendar in paper for home.  I think I've only opened my calendar book once or twice the last couple of months.  I also want to avoid the bulky attachments on the right hand side as it won't be as easy to write my lists with those in the way.   I have a blackberry, but don't really like the calendar functionality on it.  (And tried the task scheduling, but got angry at it for telling me what to do.)  lol<br></div>

<div class="content">X47 definitely seems to deliver to North America. I'm in California, and I've just ordered an A6-sized one. This seems like a fantastic system!<br><br>The ordering back end is all in German, and possibly the slowest e-commerce site I've ever encountered, but it's not unmanageable with Google Language Tools and some patience.</div>

<div class="content">Re: Translation.  For FireFox users there is a pretty nice add-in called Ubiquity.  It does lots of things but one is translations.  Highlight the text, press CTL SPACE and type TR into the pop-up window and bang, an instant translation.  Good enough to get the job done, anyway.<br><br>It has many other uses such as instantly sending page clips as email and doing instant maps and such.  It is open ended but still in development.</div>
