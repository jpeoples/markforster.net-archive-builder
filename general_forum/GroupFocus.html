<div class="content">Im looking for methods to get a loose-knit office team all working effectively getting everything done. Anybody have suggestions for communicating what needs doing (lots of things), and who is doing them?</div>

<div class="content">Alan, not sure if it's over-kill for your situation, but in most places where I've worked that were efficiently run, we did up a list of deliverables and deadlines for projects and whose responsibility it was to get them to us (for external people).  They weren't necessarily the ones actually doing it.  <br><br>We also kept internal calendars of deadlines, deliverables and who was assigned to what deliverable. <br><br>We did it all in excel and just emailed it out.  <br><br>I've also done the same thing managing it in Outlook (the delegate function).  I preferred excel though for some reason, probably because I'm lazy and could get the junior intern type people to just change everything for me.  If it was in my outlook, I'd have to either grant them access or do it myself.<br><br>Where I am now, they have an internal calendar set up in Outlook for the whole finance team with all the stuff due on it.</div>

<div class="content">I assume you had a manager who assigned tasks to people?<br><br>I'm looking to have people assign themselves.  The question is making stuff visible, and establishing a framework for everyone to actively participate. I would like a little more structure than just one open list in excel. <br><br> I don't have outlook literacy as far as group delegation is concerned and don't have ms exchange.</div>

<div class="meta">2010-04-19 23:53</div>
<div class="content">Yup, I was the manager that assigned the projects to people.  People can assign themselves but someone has to ensure that everything gets done.  And there are always some jobs that have to be delegated just because nobody wants to do them.  We'd just meet as a group before month-ends, quarters or special projects etc. to review who was doing what and switch things up if desired and it made sense.<br><br>Are you looking for a flow chart / project plan type of dependency?  That was built into our excel model.  Believe me, it was very structured.  <br><br>There's a thread around here about 8 months or so ago where we were talking about Gantt, PERT - all that fun stuff.  Why don't you do up a model with post-it notes?  <br><br>Otherwise, I don't know - the original scenario was kind of vague as to what you were looking to achieve.</div>

<div class="content">Yes, I'm good at being vague. :-/<br><br>I'm not interested in PERT, GANTT stuff.  These are small projects, but we have half a dozen of them on the go, and each of them have a variety of tasks associated with them.  I simply want everyone to be fully aware of what's going on, and to participate by suggesting things that need doing, figuring out priorities intuitively (with discussion), picking things that are ready to be done, and communicate that it's being done.  <br><br>I guess a doable approximation of this is a spreadsheet I manage, with tasks organized into groups, mailed to everyone, and I update it on request.  I just feel like there might be a better way.</div>

<div class="content">A Google Docs spreadsheet is available to your whole team. Everyone can update it. At the same time.<br><br>You need to force people to use it for a month or so, until it is baked into the normal way of doing things.<br><br>Wave is a kind of mashup of eMail, instant messaging and Wiki. It is pretty free form and can be quite clunky in its present beta form. And can't do tables. <br><br>I think a simple Google spreadsheet is the way to go. Google's account setup process can be a bit tricky: someone almost certainly has gmail and can help talk you through.<br><br>Of course, the very best way is to get everyone in one room and cover one large wall with writing.</div>

<div class="content">Alan: When I was looking for collaborative methods myself, I had come across commercial services like central desktop: <br><br><a href="http://www.centraldesktop.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.centraldesktop.com</a><br><br>There are a variety of such services you might find useful, and googling will throw up any number of them.<br><br>It was overkill for me. Dropbox is sufficient for my collaborative needs, where files are simply uploaded and worked on by members in my group. <br><br>Hope you find parts of this useful.</div>

<div class="content">"A Google Docs spreadsheet is available to your whole team. Everyone can update it. At the same time."<br><br>You can do the same thing in excel - which is the standard in every company I've worked in.  And track changes if you like.  I'm just an excel junkie.<br><br>I've heard good things about Basecamp, never used it personally.<br><br>But Will's right, a whiteboard and a room or post-it notes and a wall work pretty well.</div>

<div class="content">I'm looking into the Google Docs approach and the whiteboard approach.  I don't see how Excel can do the job.  If it's one file, everybody is locked out while one person edits it, no?  And if it's many files on many machines, how does everyone get updated?  How do edits get merged?</div>

<div class="content">Thanks that works technically Jacqueline.  Now to see if it will work in practice with people actually referring to the workbook.</div>

<div class="meta">2010-04-20 20:01</div>
<div class="content">Well, you could try the "you decide by XXX date or I'll decide for you and you might not like what I decide" method.  <br><br>Alan, if you're the manager have you ever read "It's okay to be the boss?"  It's a good book if you like being a really hands-on kind of manager - or like a coach/mentor approach to managing.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the tip.  That book isn't in stock locally, but I'm gonna pick up "Don't Be That Boss" instead :-)  I think it has a similar theme despite it's opposite title and comes highly recommended by Amazonians.  Anyhow, it's one thing to tell people what to do.  I can do that.  It's another thing for those things to be useful/helpful.</div>

<div class="content">Alan,<br><br>"Now to see if it will work in practice with people actually referring to the workbook."<br><br>They won't.<br><br>Even after you've sold them the idea, you will need to constantly push them. And yourself. Every time you think or speak about an action, your first reference must be to the spreadsheet. <br><br>Changing other people's behaviour is hard. But possible, with perseverance.</div>

<div class="content">And a tiny point on Excel: the shared file function only works (in office 2007) on a fileshare. <br><br>Seems obvious, but if your IT department is obsessively pushing you onto Sharepoint sites, you would be better to use a Sharepoint list.</div>

<div class="content">Hey the library had your book Jacqueline!  It's a decent read though nothing spectacular.  Basically it's saying how and why to take charge.</div>

<div class="content">Alan, I think the benefit - for me - came in the application.  But I had a couple of tough cases to deal with at one point where the methods worked perfectly.  <br>YMMV</div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline,<br><br>Can Excel be set to show other users' changes as they make them? I'm looking for a virtual interactive whiteboard and this might be the answer. <br><br>(Looking at the Excel help, it seems to suggest that you have to synchronise changes and resolve conflicts rather than making them on a "first come first served" basis as you would with post-its stuck on a wall. Which is what I'm trying to duplicate.)<br><br>I'd prefer to use Excel (part of the corporate toolset) if possible. If not, there's always Google.<br><br>Thanks in advance.</div>

<div class="content">Hey Will, I'm not sure that I understand the question correctly.  We used to do that as well for Sarbanes Oxley tracking (have to show what had changed).   When reviewing, if there was conflicts, I would set things up so that I manually overruled other users changes.  (Hmm. Can I do that here too? LOL)  What version are you running?  I'm on 2003 at this client, missing the new one badly.  Did you do this from the help?:<br>_______________________________________________________________________<br>Turn on change tracking for a workbook<br>On the Tools menu, click Share Workbook, and then click the Editing tab. <br>Select the Allow changes by more than one user at the same time check box. <br>Click the Advanced tab. <br>Under Track changes, click Keep change history for, and in the Days box, type the number of days of change history that you want to keep. <br>Be sure to enter a large-enough number of days because Microsoft Excel permanently erases any change history older than this number of days. <br><br>Click OK, and if prompted to save the file, click OK. <br>Note   Turning on change tracking also shares the workbook. <br>________________________________________________________________________<br><br>I'm not sure that it would be good as a virtual whiteboard.  You can do the same thing in Word - track changes that is.  We used to do that all the time for annual reports & legal stuff.  It might get kind of messy though if you keep it in a blacklined version.</div>

<div class="content">"if there was conflicts, I would set things up so that I manually overruled other users changes. (Hmm. Can I do that here too? " - I usually just ignore them.<br><br>Thanks for the instant response, Jacqueline. I'm looking for something slightly different: one session where everyone can see the same thing all the time. At the end of the session we sign the agreed diagram and publish. <br><br>Wildly off topic though: I'll pursue my researches elsewhere, or stick with my Google spreadsheet.<br><br>Thanks again.<br>Wildly off topic</div>
