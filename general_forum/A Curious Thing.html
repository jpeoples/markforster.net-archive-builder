<div class="content">Hi all<br><br>I was searching the forum for something and came across this old (pre AF2) posting about the advantages/disadvantages of having more than one list:<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/764772#post764839" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/764772#post764839</a><br><br> When I was working with AF1 I found I needed different lists for different areas of my life (one for home, one for my painting, etc.) and yet I've found since changing to AF2 I have one main list and only make other lists for very specific things like shopping. I started a new list from scratch for AF2 as I'd actually stopped using AF1 some time before Mark announced AF2. Yet now I'm finding my one list, even when used quite sloppily, is keeping me on top of tasks very well. Also the new dismissal system is working much better at sorting the wheat from the chaff!! By allowing myself a fair bit of flexibility with how I use my list I'm finding it much, much easier to keep going with AF2 whereas with AF1 by now I would have stopped using it altogether.<br><br>Has anyone else found any of these types of changes in how they use AF1 and AF2?</div>

<div class="content">Exactly the same with me. I switched from three lists to one, starting afresh. I'm finding AF2 to be an improvement, though another factor in my case is that I switched from using an electronic list to notebook and pen, which may also have helped.</div>

<div class="content">I was struggling with two lists, and after that with the stalactite/stalagmite method in AF1. I also started AF2 with a fresh list and found out I only need only one list now. I am quite happy with it.</div>
