<div class="content">I'm digging into John Maxwell's new book, "Intentional Living".  It's premature to say, but I feel it's the most impactful book I've read in ages.  (Review: <a href="http://www.christianpost.com/news/christian-jesus-john-maxwell-leadership-intentional-living-147351/pageall.html)." target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.christianpost.com/news/christian-jesus-john-maxwell-leadership-intentional-living-147351/pageall.html).</a>  <br><br>At root, I believe intentional living arises simply out of combining two things: Deciding what you want to happen (good intentions), and consistently working to realize those intentions.  At this level, there is nothing grandiose; no  50000 foot view.  (Grand ideas are not excluded, and in fact Maxwell advises developing your self-knowledge, deep-end brainstorming etc., thoughts as part of your pursuit of intentional living.  I may or may not embrace that part of his book, we'll see as I read on.)<br><br>Ultimately it's a daily pursuit of "significance", doing what matters.  It seems to bring a certain clarity when I make this my primary focus.  In particular, intentional living is all-encompassing, affecting how I approach everything I think and do, not just setting goals.  You might for example latch onto a pattern of always thinking "What's more impactful?" or daily considering "Who can I make a difference for today?"  <br><br>For my part, I intend to continue applying FVP (no question) to my activities; but to have the things that get onto the list be influenced by this manner of thinking, making sure the items on there are things I want to accomplish, and phrased to promote concrete action.  There are also things outside of my listed activities, and I will set my mind to making those more fruitful, apart from any system.</div>

<div class="content">Alan Baljeu:<br><br>Thanks for the book recommendation. It sounds interesting.<br><br>I'm sure I wrote a forum post a month or so ago suggesting significance as a possible question for FVP, i.e. "What is more significant than x?". But I can't find it. Maybe I used some other word. Anyway, I never pursued it myself, but I might do so at some stage.</div>

<div class="content">Mark, you used the word significance. I remember that 100%. Happy new year, btw.</div>

<div class="content">Christopher<br><br>I still can't find it - even though one of the results the search engine brought up for the word "significance" was your post above!</div>

<div class="content">What I was envisaging when I was developing the idea of significance shortly before I left for Australia was a two-fold process:<br><br>1. Identify my most significant project.<br><br>2. Write a dynamic list of everything that needs to be done in order to get that project completed, INCLUDING all the ancillary stuff that needs to be continuing while the project is going on but which isn't actually part of the project itself.<br><br>The focus on the project as the centre of everything I was doing proved very effective. I used it in the last week before departing for Australia and during my stops on the journey (Singapore, Melbourne) on my way to Queensland. However I didn't use it while at my destination as the the choice of what to do was so small I never needed to use a list at all.<br><br>When I got back I got sidetracked onto other things so I've never yet tested it out really well.</div>
