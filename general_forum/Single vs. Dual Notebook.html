<div class="content">I've been using AF since the beginning of the Beta program and (since I work outside the home)  have taken MarkF's advice to setup a separate notebook for each of the two locations.   This has been working very well - I love the system.<br><br>My question:  Has anyone (who works away from home) yet tried merging their two notebooks?  Any pros and cons?  I'm currently using a small moleskine reporter's style (flip from the top) notebook and if I treat the open page as one long skinny page, I can put about fifty items on a "page".      As I'm using it now, I started from the back for home and from the front for work, but I'm thinking that keeping it all together might be adequate.<br><br>I love the small reporter's style notebook as I can keep it in a shirt pocket for instant note taking - and a couple of paperclips easily mark the spot where I'm currently working and the spot to add new items.   However... whenever I'm ready to capture a thought, I find it oddly irritating to have to decide whether to open to the work or to the home side.<br><br>It seems that with a sufficient number of lines per page I shouldn't have to make a conscious decision at the point of ideation -  as  I can eventually get to everything in its correct context. <br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark<br><br>There have been a number of posts early on about the pros and cons of 1 or 2 notebooks.  I'm going to updae the FAQ's post shortly so will try to hunt those threads out for you.  Watch out for the FAQ update! (It's on my list!)</div>

<div class="content">I fluctuate on this, too. I do work from home, but I have a strong inclination to break out real, money-making work from all the other tasks, so I can focus on those during work hours.<br><br>The trouble is exactly what you described--that hiccup as you go to enter a task--which list does it go on??? <br><br>I'm still experimenting, but leaning (right now) toward One LIst to Rule Them All.<br><br>ds</div>

<div class="content">I have two books even though I do primarily work from home and love the fact that I am not distracted by having to scan through non related items depending on where I am working and whether I am in @Home or @Work mode. I have generally found that I have had little problem in having a strong feeling about which items should go in which book. <br><br>Mark, sorry if you have answered this before, but as you are also home based what do you do??<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">ds:<br><br>That would certainly be my recommendation for those working from home. I have found it works brilliantly for me personally.</div>

<div class="content">I'm musing about combining my Home and Office ones too. For those of us already with several pages in each, is there a good strategy for combining them into one should I decide to do so? (I'm vacillating on the choice at the moment.)</div>

<div class="content">I just started to experiment with having different books integrated. I need three of them: things to be done in the office, things to be done at home and things which I can do everywhere (i.e. for which I have to use the laptop or which are of general natures). And I work both from home and from my office.<br><br>Starting point was to have different pages in one notebook. Then I could just skip the non relevant pages. But the disadvantage is to find the right page which might be buried somewhere within the currently 10 open pages. My new setting will be: Split the page: Most tasks are general (not bound to office or home). Thus, I will start on the left side of my notebook (small moleskine) with the general tasks, on the right side top with  the home tasks and at the right side bottom with the office tasks. If the left side (general tasks) has been filled, I go to the next left side in the book - unless the right side is still not used. If it is still empty then I use it also for general tasks. If the side which is used for office or home specific tasks is filled, I go to the next available right side in the book. It should be quite easy to mark the correct pages in the book (one for general, one for location specific tasks). <br><br>When cycling through the book the tasks on a page are general (at least about one half), and about half of the rest is location specific for the location where I'm currently in. Of course, some of the tasks are not doable in that moment - this might become a problem when the page should be dismissed - but I will see, I anyway haven't dismissed anything so far. <br><br>Sounds more complicated than it is - sorry for the long winded description.<br><br>Wolfgang<br></div>

<div class="content">For Mark and others working from home and using one notebook: I've been using two even though I work from home. When I'm working I don't want to be distracted by home tasks (I have enough trouble with being distracted from work), and when I'm done working, I don't want to think about work. But it is a bit cumbersome, and of course there is some crossover anyway (some home items need to be done on the Internet, for example).<br><br>My question is this: do you find that work/home tasks "stand out" during the times you are focusing on each of those arenas and others from the other arena recede into the background? And I think in general I'd like to hear the case for one notebook. Thanks.</div>

<div class="content">I am new to AF but am very hopeful.  I am finding that I like using a composition book--nice size, not as overwhelming as an 8.5 X 11 spiral and bigger than a steno.  I enter items for work starting at the front of the book and items for home at the back.  It's the same approach Mark L wrote about in the first post of this discussion, but so far it is easy for me to know which list I want to add to and it's strangely fun to open the book from the back for the home items.  I really don't want to see my items mixed since I try to create some separation between work and personal, but I do have to do some of my work at home so I may eventually merge them if I have any problems with my current format.  I CAN imagine having separate books for each location if each book STAYS at that location.  However, I need to be able to add work items if they come to mind when I'm at home and vice versa.  Having two books and having them both travel with me would be a real irritation to me.  I hate having to fuss with a calendar in addition to my AF notebook as it is.  Thanks for reading my post.<br>Joyce</div>

<div class="content">Quick follow up here.  I've been running for the last week with a single notebook for both home and work - and haven't noticed any problems at all.<br><br>Of note : <br><br>I'm using a reporter's notebook that gives me about 50 lines per dual page.  I think that may help, as I have plenty of opportunities to review each page, both at home and work, before dismissing anything.<br><br>I had initially thought that I would have to perform some sort of two step page dismissal (i.e. a page isn't really dismissed until I dismiss it once at work and once at home).   Fortunately, that hasn't been necessary.  The system seems to work just fine under the Mark F's original guidelines.  Occasionally I will take advantage of the rephrasing loophole/clause and move an item off of a page and restate it at the end of the list, but that really hasn't happened often and I've never had the sense that I'm cheating the system.</div>

<div class="content">A month on and I'm finding the single notebook to work well.  I do have tasks that I extract onto other lists, such as for projects, but that falls more into my concept of project planning anyway - the difference being that now I would be more likely to treat those lists in an AF way than as a to do list.  The entry of those items to the project list comes from AF as does the task to action the project.  For me that keeps everything in the one list very easily.<br><br>With regard to work vs home items, I find that items naturally stand out according to where I am or what "mode" of working I am in.  For example "Update Family Tree" or similar leisure tasks have been standing out at appropriate times - evenings or weekends - and work tasks during the day.  Margaret raised this question above.  However, from my experience so far, if an item from the "other mode" stood out I would "trust the system" and action it.  Obviously I am home based so that is not a problem for me - if I "update Family Tree" between 9-5 no-one will sack me - similarly I can easily do accounts work on a Saturday without having to go to an external office. I suspect that if I was working in an external office "sort sock drawer" would be unlikely to stand out - even if it did hold more rational appeal that whatever I was currently engaged in :-)<br><br>I am finding that the system itself really does balance everything far better than I could myself.  That's certainly not to say that I haven't had some difficulties, primarily due to deadlined backlogs and also to limited discretionary time on occasion.  however the system has cetainly enabled me to deal with those eventualities in a far, far more efficient way than I would ever have done without it.  It takes some time to put the degree of trust in the system that is needed in those circumstances (we have probably built up a significant habit of panic and giving in to the headless chicken syndrome), but even in those scenarios the system does work .......</div>

<div class="content">I started AF by strictly following the 2 list rule and had one notebook on my desk at work and my home list in a notebook I kept in my messenger bag (so it is usually with me--even when at work).  But since my home notebook is a Circa, after a week or so I just inserted a new divider and added pages for my work list.  So I still have two lists, but in the same notebook.  I carry around a fisher space pen and a blank index card in my pocket at all times in case I need to jot anything down, then transfer it to one of the two lists later.  So far I haven't had an issue with knowing which list to add to and I prefer keeping the lists separate (at least for now).</div>

<div class="content">I've had a change in my job, where I now have to keep a stricter schedule (we got reclassified as "non-exempt", i.e., hourly, whereas before we were "exempt", i.e., salaried).<br><br>I decided to use this opportunity to switch to separate books -- one for work, one for personal.<br><br>I am finding that it is much crisper, much easier to stay focused on what is really important in that particular context, and that my pages fly by much more quickly.<br><br>I did like having it all in one notebook, so I could stay mentally tuned to the items in the other context, and use the AF system to actually prompt me for when it's time to switch contexts.  <br><br>But now I am thinking it may have been better to do it with two notebooks all along -- and just block out the time on my calendar for when I'm doing which context.<br><br>Also, having two notebooks is not the nightmare I was thinking.  I keep them both handy all the time.  So, if I'm "working" but have a personal thought, I can still just jot it down in my personal AF book very easily.  It's working great.</div>

<div class="content">I use a small Molesken notebook, with soft cover. From the frontpage I write all my work stuff, then I flip it around and from the backpage I write my homestuff. <br><br>This works perfect for me. Because alot of home stuff I come to think of while at work and vice versa. <br><br>And it fits my pocket, so I can bring it where ever I go. Brilliant.</div>

<div class="content">I'm following a recommendation someone made on the discussion forum sometime ago - work tems are written from the top of the page downwards, home/personl/family are listed from the bottom of the page upwards. Draw, or rule, a line where they meet and you can immediately see which is which and keep them sepaarte if you want to.</div>

<div class="content">I'm keeping all items together, i.e. Work and Home/Errands, starting from the front of the book. I use the same book for notes, working from the back of the book to meet up eventually with my AF list. I have roughly a 50/50 split of home and work/errand activities so one does not really dominate the other. I'm finding this structure very useful at the moment as scanning the list acts as a review of all my work and home/errands activities.<br> <br>I feel this benefits me as it keeps all activities fresh in my mind and possibly facilitates problem solving at a sub-conscious level. And on a practical level, I can do many of my actvities either at home, work, or on the move.</div>
