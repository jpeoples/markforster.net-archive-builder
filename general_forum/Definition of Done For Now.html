<div class="content">Over the past few weeks I've been experimenting with a modification of the Authorized Projects List that seems to be working really well for me.<br><br>Specifically, instead of just having a list of Authorized Projects / Commitments, I explicitly articulate what the "definition of done for now" for each is. I've found this works the best of any commitment management system I've used so far.<br><br>A few times I had to switch from RZ to FVP due to urgency at work, and it seems to work well with both.<br><br>Some Examples:<br> - Church work: Service leaflet and bulletin complete. DIT style task list completed.<br> - Work: Instant messaging cleared from yesterday, email inbox cleared from yesterday, at least 100 minutes spent working on code.<br> - Paper: I use a two-phase DIT style "yesterbox". This is complete when everything is filed or actioned to completion.<br><br>Various other projects are managed by a what's better list, daily journal, or Goal/Status/Next Action descriptions as appropriate.<br><br>I'm still a bit overwhelmed and really should pause about half of them until I get the current ones under control, but I still have a problem with project gluttony. *grin*.<br><br>Both FVP and RZ handle the occasional non-listed item alright, but I have to be careful not to write down *anything* I might want to do, otherwise it's too much for me to handle.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for these ideas. My projects seem to go on and on. I like your paper Yesterbox.</div>

<div class="content">I think this is an excellent approach.  When I have items well-scoped I find it both focuses my efforts and entices me to put more effort to just complete it.  Without the Done named, I am more likely to drift and not get the thing done.</div>
