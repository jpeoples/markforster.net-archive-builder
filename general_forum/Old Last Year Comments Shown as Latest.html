<div class="content">Mark, Please instruct the website maintainence guys to fix up the right column of Latest Posts.<br>They are actually Last Years post of the same date .. some date issue like Y2k or else..<br>---By the way. I am fed up with G T D. and searching alternative -- I am messed without something like G T D or so .But  I don't want G T D. for the instilling habit  thing among many other.Only a ZEN OR BUDDHA CAN BE SO MINDFUL. That's one reason among other few. I am a little confused about the various systems here. Please recommend something. I have read many many posts here and still am confused.  I had liked the system portrayed in the video years ago. where you used a notebook. used dots to work out the lists. I missed the technique and inclined towards G T D. so I request you Mark and All the members here  and ask  What System would you suggest to a G T D  deserter / G T D Freedom achiever. mind that I have used 6+ years. and I have my own theory against it..Thank you Mark and I was going to wish you Happy B'day on the 29 Feb. I took the other Mark to be you.. but happy birthday to you in advance.</div>

<div class="content">Still a great pleasure looking at this video i haven't seen since a long time. All appears now so clearly ! AF1 is for me the best system I ever tried. It has a real effect for acting by mixing rationality and intuition. So great !</div>
