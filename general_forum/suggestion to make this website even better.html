<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>I wonder if your webmaster could add a skip navigation link to the top of these pages. I mostly use my mobile phone to read these pages and have to scroll through pages of navigation before getting to the content. This problem excists for people using a screen reader as well. The solution is simple and just 5 minutes for implementation:<br><a href="http://diveintoaccessibility.org/day_11_skipping_over_navigation_links.html" rel="nofollow">http://diveintoaccessibility.org/day_11_skipping_over_navigation_links.html</a><br><br>Thanks!</div>

<div class="content">That topic came up once or twice in the past. For example in this thread:<a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/674069#post679690" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/674069#post679690</a><br><br>Back then i proposed to move the content before the navigation in the source code, which would result in the same page for desktop users but more usable pages for users of mobile-browsers-that-are-not-safari. A skip link is of course also a good idea. Mark, my offer from then still stands, I can help you with that as well as the IE6 issues your page has.</div>

<div class="content">Sorry, I just realized my signature lacked my last name since I switched browsers. Added it back. I'm not AndreasE. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">While we're on suggestions: Is there any way to number or identify the posts? I don't know if this is even possible but I do get confused as to where I last read on a thread and also there are times I would like to be able to refer back to a specific post. <br><br>The info here is so rich I would love to be able to access it more easily. Would anyone else be interested in this?<br>Ideas?  Mark? Andreas H.? Your comments on this?</div>

<div class="content">Each Post does have a number, but you don't see it normaly. You have to right-click on some whitespace on the page and select "View Source" (This may vary depending on which browser you use). Then find the specific post you want to link to, best by searching for some of its content or the poster's name. The post is surrounded by several HTML tags, and in one of them you'll find something like this: id="post886075"<br><br>That is the post number. To  link to this conversation, you'd use this link: <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/885566" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/885566</a><br><br>To link to this conversation and specifically the post where you asked this question, you'd use this: <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/885566#post886075" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/885566#post886075</a><br><br>I know that's not really comfortable and doesn't help you to refer to a post in conversation with someone, but it works for linking to specific posts.<br><br>Re knowing where you were last time, the SiteDelta addon for Firefox is somewhat useful for that. I posted a demonstration for it here: <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/850591#post852041" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/850591#post852041</a><br><br>Recently I stopped using SiteDelta, I'm programming my own "forum reader" to get around some of its shortcomings. I intended it for personal use only, bu if Mark has nothing against it, I could make it available for public use.</div>
