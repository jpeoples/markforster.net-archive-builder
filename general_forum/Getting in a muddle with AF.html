<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-02-12 11:57</div>
<div class="content">There have been several posts about concerns regarding items that are important getting missed and about clutter build up from partially started projects or undone routine tasks.  There appears to be a point at around say 20-25 active pages when these concerns are highest, and various recommendations have been made, including reminders of the common sense rule and the little and often rule, as well as adjusting the speed of moving through the pages by doing less items per page on each pass.<br><br>I thought it may be helpful to detail a few observations ...........<br><br>When I started AF I used one list for all items, home and work type items.  As it was just after Christmas there were a lot of home type "clearing up" items!  Of course many of these tasks, though necessary, were my "great procrastinators".  One of the features of a procrastinator is that it comes with a varying level of guilt attached to it - "I ought to be doing x instead".  Strangely, when I started doing AF it was those very tasks that started "standing out" .  What I found though was not just that I could do them quickly and easily, but as they didn't have the guilt attached my mind was somehow free to focus on other things.  Clearing those specific tasks not only got them done but also highlighted the impact they had been having.<br><br>As time went on, my focus changed, quite naturally, to the work type items and project areas, areas that I had been resisting previously, but by about week 4 I was becoming increasingly concerned that some of the domestic tasks were not standing out and I was getting in a muddle.  I looked at "tweaking" the system, changing timings, creating new lists for those items, but, although that had an impact on the tasks, I starting experiencing the old feelings of resistance and it seemed the system "wasn't working".  It seemed the only answer was to go back to my lists and work them exactly as the instructions, without "tweaks" and see what happened so that is what I did.<br><br>What I found was that those dometstic tasks were actually "standing out" at different times to my work related tasks!  When you are home based it is easy for the boundaries to become blurred and to be "working" at all hours and doing housework during "work" time.  The result is that you feel you are always working.  What I am finding is that work type tasks are standing out between say 9-6 and home (or hobby) tasks are standing out in the evening and at weekends. By "trusting the system" (and it was a GREAT relief to go back to it!) everything has started to fall into a natural pattern.  I had always wanted to "feel like" doing housework at weekends (let's face it, it has to be done!) but never had.  I now "feel" like stopping work at a realistic time rather than working on, and on , and on and .........<br><br>Oh, and the reason for my "muddle"?  As I had some high priority deadlines AF naturally ensured they were completed, which did necessitate working over one weekend (which I felt fine with - and was motivated!)  and I was away for another weekend.  Problem identified and solved!  More of those domestic tasks get done naturally, without even reference to my lists on occasion,  and I can see how these areas will just gradually slot into the right time and place.<br><br>The fact is that backlogs DO have a knock on effect.  At the end of the day WE still have to do the tasks - Mary Poppins does not turn up to magically clear them for us!  What does happen though is that we are able to do the tasks - without procrastination and at the right time - if we "trust the system" and that by working so much more effectively the chances of creating future backlogs are drastically reduced if not eliminated altogether!</div>
