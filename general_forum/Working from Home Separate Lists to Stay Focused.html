<div class="content">Wow. I started in AF3 (RAF) when it came out about a month ago, and it's been great! That is, it's the ONLY system I've ever managed to use for more than a few days. I don't feel the intimidation I had with other systems I tried that were electronic based. Together with Mark's system, I think the simplicity and ease of paper has been a significant part of my current success.<br><br>Anyway, here's my question for anyone who's working at home out there:<br><br>1) Do you work on one list or two ("work" and "home")?<br><br>2) What version of AF are you working with? If AF4, do you recommend the switch from AF3 for someone who works at home? <br><br>3) If only one list, do you find you don't get enough work done during the day? In other words, do you find at the end of the day that you've been distracted with things that seem important and needed getting done, but never the less don't "pay the bills?"<br><br>Thanks for everyone who is making this forum great!<br>Eric</div>

<div class="content">Eric,<br><br>I use only one list.  I have only one life ;-)  I don't experience a problem.  I do have to be aware if I am using easy tasks to flee harder more important ones, but that would be the case no matter what.<br><br>I have just started experimenting with AF4 and I can't imagine that it would not be perfect for anyone in any environment.  But then we are all different.</div>

<div class="content">I use two out of necessity. At work I like to be able to electronically tag tasks and sync with my Blackberry. This allows me to rapidly call up tasks related to a project or person. It's also nice in Outlook to drag tasks to the calendar, or an email to Tasks, etc. Finally, at work I am 99% of my time at the keyboard so it's easier to type than break off and find a notebook.<br><br>In my personal life I get to be a little more 'natural' and a pocket notebook is ideal. <br><br>I tried doing both in the pocket notebook but switched back to Outlook at work for the electronic convenience.</div>

Do you find yourself being able to stay focused on work during the workday? To rephrase, do the "work" items stick out to you as more important (so you do them) during the work day so you get them done, or do you find you're getting important non-work stuff done more? My concern is that during the work day, I need to (mostly) WORK.<br><br><I have just started experimenting with AF4 and I can't imagine that it would not be perfect for anyone in any environment.><br><br>Do you work you list ALL DAY? I don't yet so I'm wondering if it will suit that type of style.<br><br>Thanks!<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Eric. I have had my own business for about 25 years and do work at home as well. Managing my own time has always been a challenge and it has taken me years to achieve at least some success with it, and AF has certainly helped with this. I find if I don't get in my "I'm at work now" mode I will often go off and do things that while they may need to be done, aren't really business related. Recently I have become more determined in these areas (finding AF was a part of this, but there are other things I am now doing as well) and I find I am (now) more productive and focused than before.<br><br>So, when it comes to AF (I am trying out AF4 and love it so far) I do prefer putting business related tasks on the top of the page and home/personal ones on the bottom working up--what has been called here on the forum the stalactite/stalagmite method (writing tasks and working from both the top down and from the bottom up on the page for just such purposes of having a divided list). That way I can stay focused on business tasks during my "work hours" without getting pulled off on home or personal ones. <br><br>One issue now, with AF4 is the stalactite/stalagmite method doesn't work as well. I am still figuring out how to incorporate this separation of tasks with the new AF4 version. At this point, I am pretty much working the business part of the list in AF4 fashion and the home/personal part in AF fashion. We'll see how it goes.</div>

My concern is that during the work day, I need to (mostly) WORK.  <<<<br><br>Yes, it seems to work for me ... mostly.  I have tried using highlighters to help: yellow for dismissed, pink for priority, blue for work, green for home, that kind of thing.  It helps, but then the list turns into a riot of colors and that can be distracting.  I've used tags and that is also a bit distracting.  Here is one place an electronic implementation shines.  I tried using my Palm with ListPro and that worked to some extent.  I could filter and see ONLY the work tasks, for example.  But then the overhead is too high ... if I want to add something I have to fiddle not only with hardware, but have to change he filters so I can add a new item, then I have to remember to tag it properly.  It is all a trade off.<br><br>>>> <I have just started experimenting with AF4 and I can't imagine that it would not be perfect for anyone in any environment.><br><br>Do you work you list ALL DAY? I don't yet so I'm wondering if it will suit that type of style.  <<<<br><br>Me too ;-)  It is tough working it all day.  I'm hoping it is like building a muscle and I'll get "stronger".  Right now it is leaving my like a limp rag by the end of 4 hours or so.  I find it too intense to keep going to a list to find out what I should be doing.  But then, I don't have the list sprinkled with the kind of "break" tasks Mark does ... like "Watch a Movie".  I'm going to keep on pushing and hope that I get the combination right.<br></div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the replies!<br><br>Beth:<br><One issue now, with AF4 is the stalactite/stalagmite method doesn't work as well.><br><br>Couldn't you just do the separations in different ways? ie- Seperation between "work" and "home" could be a "taskless" space with a line through it, and the separation between "open" and "closed" lists could just be a line between tasks (with no blank space between).</div>

<div class="content">I put everything on one list, and put a little 'W' in front of my work tasks to distinguish them from my personal tasks. This is enough for me to quickly see which tasks I should focus on at work.</div>

<div class="content">Sabrina: Yeah, I was thinking of something like that, but I use a handful of tags {errands "@", urgent "(a dot)", with (wife) "A" (for her first name), calls I can make anywhere during down time "C"} in the left column and I don't want it to get too crowded. I *was* thinking of an indent though... maybe just a dot, although I use that currently for urgent tasks.<br><br>I could go pure (tagless) AF, but then they seem to be working out- I try to keep them at a minimum- only 4 right now.</div>

<div class="content">I've been putting a square checkbox in front of the task for a long time. I recently decided to give this checkbox a specfic shape for each context : square = todo, circle = outside (errands, shopping, etc...), triangle pointing up = call to make, triangle pointing down = waiting for. It does work quite well, without cluttering up the task lines. I'm sure there are other shapes available if you have more contexts : stars, arrows, etc...</div>

<div class="content">Quick question...in AF4, if you have items on your list (either in backlog or active), how do you close/convert the lists?  For example, if I am at work (in the office) and have "mow lawn" on the list, I could not dismiss backlogged items since I could not do the task even if I wanted to. <br><br>Kenny</div>

<div class="content">Kenny,<br><br>>>>  Quick question...in AF4, if you have items on your list (either in backlog or active), how do you close/convert the lists?  <<<<br><br>One small point.  You never "close" the "open list".  You convert it to a "closed list" at the appropriate tiime.<br><br>>>>  For example, if I am at work (in the office) and have "mow lawn" on the list, I could not dismiss backlogged items since I could not do the task even if I wanted to.  <<<br><br>If you follow the rules exactly it might look like this:<br><br>- You are at work and make the last pass over the closed list<br>- There is nothing to do on that list<br>- You highlight the remaining open items<br>- You make a pass over the open list<br>- You draw a line at the end of the open list (marking the end of the new closed list)<br>- You come back to the closed list and decide for each item what to do with it<br>- "Mow the Lawn" would be copied to the end of the NEW closed list (after the line you just drew)<br>- When you get home and make your next full pass over the closed list, you'll hit "Mow the Lawn" so you get out the mower and do it.<br><br>Easy Peasy.  ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Okay, but what if you have 40 at-home-tasks, with 30 of them doable only at the weekend?<br><br>Rewriting them would be somewhat cumbersome, so I have three tags:<br>O = office, H = Home, WE = weekend.<br></div>

<div class="content">Mike,<br>Just 'cuz I'm new at this, I'm reading carefully.  In your reply to Kenny, you said:<br>- "Mow the Lawn" would be copied to the end of the NEW closed list (after the line you just drew)<br>- When you get home and make your next full pass over the closed list, you'll hit "Mow the Lawn" so you get out the mower and do it.<br><br>But, don't you only copy "Mow the Lawn" to the NEW open list (which is, in fact, after the line you just drew)?  Then you see it on the next pass of the open list.  If it can't be done for a few days, or until the weekend, you may re-write it a few times to keep it onthe open list or put it on a different list that you don't review until the weekend comes.<br><br>Is that correct?<br></div>

<div class="meta">2009-09-11 20:36</div>
<div class="content">Sorry, the point was to clarify whether  you write it on the new CLOSED list or new OPEN list.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-09-12 9:08</div>
<div class="content">S,<br><br>You are absolutely correct.  I got tangled up in my "opens" and "closeds".  Yes, as you process the items you have on review, the ones you are keeping are added to the end of the new open list and sit there waving at you right near the front.  ;-)<br><br>It strikes me that we don't have a name for the OLD closed list.  Is it "archive" or something?</div>

<div class="content">I use three. The reason - I usuallly don't want to see my work stuff when I'm at home. Likewise, when at work, I prefer tofocus on work stuff. I do have a common list for everything. This is possible for me by using a PC/Windows Mobile app called My Life Organized. Yes I know Mark doesn't favor electronic tools, and there is something to be said for paper lists too. Nevertheless, the key to me is how I use the system. The way I see the benefits of the Autofocus system is the continuous walk through and update of the list.<br><br><br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Regarding weekend tasks: They are actually special for me, since they are related to spending time with the kids, garden work, renovation stuff,... . Thus I have a special list which I keep in my tickler file for the following Saturday. On the respective Friday (when I empty the tickler for Saturday) I check this list and transfer all tasks whic seem to be doable this weekend to my AF list. The list goes into the tickler for next Saturday.</div>

<div class="content">@Mike,<br>Why would we need a name for the OLD closed list?  Can't that be trashed/recycled/shredded?<br><br>Or, am I supposed to go back through the "archive" to look at "dismissed" items for the someday/maybe lists?  Seems like those should have been moved to a more useful place before they're dismissed.</div>

<div class="content">S,<br><br>I want terminology to be able to talk about it.<br><br>I guess it depends on how you are using your system.  Many people, Mark included, work from bound books.  And if you do that and don't want to copy your "someday/maybe" tasks over into a different place, you could just look back into the book.</div>

<div class="content">I had been keeping one list - work and home (and a post-it in my "carry with me book" of errands to do while I am out. If I am going to the post office I will forget the bank unless I write it down!) <br><br>However, about 2 weeks ago I split the lists and it as made a huge psychological difference. Before my list was so long that it felt overwhelming. Even as I work on something there is so much more to do.  Separating the lists has made me more effective. The work list is less overwhelming, and it focuses me on stuff to do in my office. If I feel like I need a break with new scenery I look at the house list.<br>The work list goes from the front of the book, the house list from the back. I have a post-it as a tab to be able to turn to the right page quickly.<br><br>Carry with me book: It's about 6x9, plastic covered spiral from Target.  I write everything in it, and I generally have it with me. If I think of something to do I write it there, a URL I find in a magazine, phone messages, stuff to buy, a great idea - instead of lots of little pieces of paper. Then at my desk I copy appropriate things to my list book. (old-fashioned, bound composition notebook with that weird print cover.)<br><br>The spiral has so much in it, phone numbers, notes from a conversation... it becomes a reference book. I keep about a year's worth of spirals on a shelf (previous years in a box.) As long as I remember about when I talked to someone, or wrote info (like the insurance co. for the guy that hit my car in February) I can flip through and find it.</div>

<div class="content">Like Mike and others, I use one list. I like to try to keep an integrated view of my life and my work, trying to view it "all of a piece." And, I can't do the work that "pays the bills" if I don't have gas in the car, food in the house--oh, and if the bills aren't paid.<br><br>If I find myself getting distracted by "maintenance" tasks, I use a timer to keep me focused on the work-work task. My issue is more likely to be the reverse, and I use a timer in that case as well, limiting the amount of time I can spend on a given project and forcing myself to switch gears.<br><br>And as others have noted, I make use of project lists, so that my AF list might say "Check X list". I'd personally go crazy if my AF list was too long.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-10-5 12:10</div>
<div class="content">Liz said it perfectly ... my way of putting it is "one life, one list".  To the extent that I want to focus my thinking on one area, I use "sub lists" within my SINGLE book that contains it all.  Firstly, I'm not organized enough to be sure I take the right list with me ... likely as not, I'd grab the wrong one and see all of the house renovation tasks while I was starting a software design meeting.  (Don't laugh, I once drove from DC to Philly for a customer meeting and left my suit hanging in its suit bag on the hall tree.  Trust me, if there is a way to screw these things up, I've already found it ;-)<br><br>The second factor is that I've found that I never know when I might want any particular bit of information.  I might be at work and be talking about plumbing while getting coffee and someone tells me that he's done that and what is the size of the pipe, or whatever ... if it is all in one book, I have it, otherwise I've lost the opportunity.  Of course, I also make calls at all kinds of odd times so I need everything there.  It has NEVER been a problem to have the ratings of a water heater mixed in with software design specs with the details of the next vacation I just booked.  It is trivial to keep that sorted out ... not so trivial to manage a bunch of books.<br><br>But that is just a matter of personal preference.  We all work differently.<br><br>As to the second point, the size of the list, I don't see that as a problem in AF.  AF requires you to look at ONLY ONE TASK at a time, make a decision, then move to the next.  It is very robotic that way.  If you look at all of the pages of your book it might seem large, but if you are processing the list ... it is one task at a time ... one foot in front of the other.<br><br>As to sub lists, I do that to keep things organized, not so much to keep the list short.  IOW, when I'm thinking "Build Deck" I want to see the tasks associated with that in some kind of order.  I don't want to see: "Apply Finish Coat of Sealer" before "Pour Foundation".  LOL ;-)  THAT is what would drive me over the edge ;-)  So I have sub lists for "Talk to Wife", "XMAS gifts this year", "Build Deck", "Overhaul Computers", "Organize Files", etc.  Anything that has a few sequenced tasks that are not completely trivial.  On that note, I will also have a broad "covering task" where there are a number of steps that ARE trivial but I don't write them down.  "Work in Yard" might be one of those.  When I get out there I can SEE what I have to do ... pull weeds, spray, mow, etc.  I don't find I need to plan that kind of thing.</div>
