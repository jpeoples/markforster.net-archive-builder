<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2014-07-28 13:06</div>
<div class="content">Hello all. <br><br>I've put together a progress & complain journal that is designed to make a Weekly Review (however you do it) more meaningful. The sheet was created in Excel, and it's designed to supplement, not replace, any productivity system you're currently using.<br><br>I'm looking for a few testers. Please email me directly: avrum AT nadigel DOT com, and I'll send you the sheet, rules and thinking behind this venture. <br><br>Merci.</div>
