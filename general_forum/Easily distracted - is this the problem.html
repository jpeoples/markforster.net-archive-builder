<div class="content">Many of us are eagerly awaiting Mark's latest system - myself included.  Rationally I think that this new system will go the way of all the others I've tried.  I'm starting to think I have a problem with distraction.  I can't settle to a task when I think of another.  A new time management system is the same.  Anyone else think the same? or different?</div>

<div class="content">I think there is a number of issues here:<br><br>1. I think we all have an obsession with time management and love to discuss it endlessly.<br>2. We all genuinly want to use the most efficient system for us.<br>3. We can't accept that one system might not be perfect and adjust accordingly.<br>4. We are too perfectionist about this - we have to accept that sometimes something is good enough.<br>5. We all love shiny new things and new beginnings!</div>

<div class="content">I have the same problem Man.  Yet AF4 has frequently enabled me to identify important tasks and postpone distraction.  I'm far from perfect in this regard, but compared to my previous habit, no comparison.  In fact, I believe that continued practice of the system is actually solving my distraction problem.<br><br>I do look forward to the new system though, because AF4 isn't perfect.  It emphasizes neglected tasks over important tasks when I should stick to the important.  We'll see if the new method helps even more.</div>

<div class="content">Avrum:<br><br><< 2) things that stir my heart >><br><br>The problem is that these are even more difficult to control than the things you need to do to make $. At least with them you have the motivation that if you don't do them you starve or at best don't have the money to do the things you do want to do.<br><br>One thing I would really have liked to do all my life is to be able to play a musical instrument. The reason I can't has frankly got nothing to do with shortage of time. It's that I've never really seriously buckled down to putting the work in.</div>

<div class="content">"The reason I can't has frankly got nothing to do with shortage of time."<br><br>Shortage of time has never been my issue. Rather, avoiding risks and possible failure, etc., are my Achilles heel vis-a-vis getting the important things done. It's an ongoing battle, one made less onerous with your systems/advice.</div>

<div class="content">All of the above is true for me. <br><br>But right now, I just need to get out my list and my timer and buckle down.<br><br>("Mmmm, shiny...")</div>

<div class="content">Hi Will<br>Ditto!  I'd be in a horrible jam if I never learned how to properly use a timer to help me work better and smarter!  <br>learning as I go<br><br>Mark, <br>Learning how to play musical instruments is far easier than you might think.  When I needed to learn how to play various instruments simultaneously (mostly for music composition), I'd set the timer to 30minutes for each one daily.  If I wasn't connecting well with one, I'd give it a bit more effort.  The good news is that learning the rudiments of playing an instrument well enough to either enjoy it or how to properly write music for it, is surprisingly fast.  It gets difficult when you start aiming for expertise.........but, I suppose that's true for most things....and people foolishly believe that having talent gives a person an edge.  It helps us to breeze through the novice and intermediate levels of proficiency but.........when you  start to desire reaching and maintaining expert levels, that's where the grinding begins!  LOL!  (p.s....If it's a true passion, it's totally worth it.)<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>Mark, if you're not particular which instrument you want to learn how to play, the easiest one by far is an autoharp!  <br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Learning,<br><br>Easier than a recorder, do you think?<br><br>My wife plays most instruments and she thinks piano is the hardest ... probably because you play so many notes simultaneously.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike<br>Yes, MUCH easier than a recorder.  Pressing a button to strike a chord is far easier than memorizing both a melody and individual notes.........perhaps a kazoo is easier to play than an autoharp!  LOL!<br>I took to piano like a fish to water but I had an awful time with EVERY reed instrument.  I lost a fortune in split reeds!  *blush*  ....and the horrible squeeking sound when you do it incorrectly sounds worse than a cat in heat!  <br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>A bonus,....with an autoharp, you don't need to learn now to read sheet music.  Just buy a fake book (professionals buy fake books rather than sheet music as you know) and follow the chord progressions....and sing along....or not!  ROTFL!  When I sing, I sound like an animal going through vivisection!  ROTFL!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>Mike......maybe your wife is correct about the piano.  I loved it immensely so I played it several hours a day because it put me in a trance.  But some of that time was grinding hard like for gymnastics and dancing.  Whenever I love something enough, it always involves tons of hard effort.  When ever I was competing for anything, I always had to give everything else a back seat.  That's where the timer came in handy.  15 to 30 minutes a day kept me up with them in the background while I put in the long hours for competitions.  Some learning stays with you and some needs fairly regular nurturing....<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Well, I might give piano another go sometime soon. But first I want to get this time management system sorted!</div>

<div class="content">Hi! I think we need a time managment system in our days. For a century ago it was not necessary, but today our lives is so full of things that happens and we need a system that helps us tackle it. Another solution would be to reduce all the things that happens, but that's not easy. So a thanks to Mark that helps us finding a good system.<br><br>Hans V</div>

<div class="content">Hans:<br><br>I think the problem is not that we have more to do. People worked incredibly long and hard hours in past ages. It's that we have so much more choice. That's a double-edged weapon: it's a good thing to have the choice, but we do need to be able to control it. That's where time management comes in - really it's about managing our attention.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark<br>The piano gave me great pleasure for decades.  I hope it does the same for you.  The main drawback for me was that a baby grand piano has a large footprint....plus, they are quite expensive to move and tune....not good for my earlier nomadic tendencies!  I truly hope that learning how to play brings you great joy!  Warning: be prepared for people to bug you to play it for their enjoyment even when you're not in the mood!  lol!<br><br>You're spot on in reference to managing our attention.  Before the auto wreck, I had many passions and aims.  Luckily, I was taught how to schedule well to juggle what was currently important and rotate my passions while experimenting with new interests.  As I stated above, I'd be in a horrible mess if I didn't know how to use a timer!  For me, the calendar and my timer were critical to make my life work well for me.  Nowadays my life is much narrower, but I still need my timer!  LOL!  I've been using them for over 50 years!  It not only focuses my attention, it launches me when pain, fear or foolish subborn resistance tries to foil my aims!  Confession:  I have three timers strategically placed around the house.  When I want to bust through a pain bout, I set the timer.  It's like someone telling me that I can at least safely try to challenge the pain and the safety valve of hearing the ding.  My chest swells when I can carry on beyond the ding!  ROTFL!  Once more, I have preserved a modicum of my dignity and guarded my freedoms!  pssst...It also helps keep my optimism alive.  I sometimes desperately need to preserve these thoughts to carry on and feel good about things in general.  Speaking of which...nine more minutes until I hear the ding!  (In this case, it's limiting my break.....)  Timers are great for folks Will and mel..............(mmmmm...shiny!)  ROTFL<br>learning as I go</div>
