<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">(Inspired in part by Richard's post about how he's implemented AF4 in Things)<br><br>I'm in a space where a bunch of stuff has hard deadlines coming due RIGHT NOW.  When I'm processing my DWM list I really need to only be choosing from those things... everything else can slide and if it gets dismissed, it gets dismissed.<br><br>I'm working DWM in Toodledo and it makes this kind of thing SO easy to deal with (I don't recall who recommended Toodledo to me when I got my iPad but THANK YOU).  Under normal circumstances I have two folders: Active and Dismissed.  My normal working mode has me using the Active list except when I'm reviewing dismissed tasks.  Now, though, I have created a third folder: "DueDatesThisWeek" and moved everything in that category over to that folder.  I'm processing it the same way I would the normal DWM list - new stuff gets entered on "page" M (given a due date of 27 Nov) and re-entries go on "page" W (given a due date of 2 Nov).  It just reduces the number of things I have to look at and reduces the anxiety that I feel looking at all the OTHER things that I could be doing.<br><br>I did something similar last week when I was away at a conference: moved everything that I COULDN'T deal with while away from home/office to its own folder so that it didn't clutter up the list that I was working with.</div>

<div class="content">To clarify Sarah, new stuff gets entered on page M unless it's due this week.  Reentries get entered on page W unless it's due this week.  stuff Due this week always gets put and reput on the DueDatesThisWeek page.  Is this correct?</div>

<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>Please check also my comment to Mark's comment for YET another way of doing DWM at <br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2010/10/26/my-favourite-time-management-system.html#comment10309909" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2010/10/26/my-favourite-time-management-system.html#comment10309909</a> (the DWM stuff starts at around the middle of it).<br><br>God bless.</div>

<div class="content">Alan- Nope, because "pages" are virtual... new stuff still gets put on "page M" (which is really just the due date according to toodledo).  That way as I add new things they still get processed in the appropriate order.  I've just filtered the list so that I'm only looking at things that have hard deadlines of this week.<br><br>Mark, nuntym - Those are great ideas, and probably ones I'd use if I was still analog!  ;^)  My digital implementation looks basically just like the long-list DWM.  I took a quick screencap to illustrate this: <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8227179/DWMinToodledo.jpg" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8227179/DWMinToodledo.jpg</a></div>
