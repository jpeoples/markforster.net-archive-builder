<div class="content">I'm wondering if the recent excursions into reflecting on AF1 and trying to refine / improve it are <br><br>(1) taking away from FV development work?<br><br>(2) dovetailing with FV development work - really along the same lines of what FV was doing anyway?<br><br>(3) an interesting side trip that may yield insights into finalizing FV?<br><br><br>(I'm referring to the new AF1 start-of-day instruction; the idea of "action threads"; the forum discussion on AF1 improvements; etc.)<br><br>Just curious...   :-)</div>

<div class="content">I'm betting more that FV is more defined by the objectives than the rules.  The objectives are relatively constant, while the rules are secret so who knows if they stay the same or change?  In any event, Mark is clearly aiming to get us hapless forum fellows to develop our thinking patterns closer to his own.</div>

<div class="content">Yes, maybe he is manipulating some of you guys.  So what?  <br>I don't think anything is being derailed with these new threads.<br><br>The human mind naturally tries to make things too complicated.  Without the benefit of MF insight, etc., I think we would try to have too many +entry points+ (capture, hot, today, tomorrow, this week, cool, project-related, contextual, someday, dated (hard), dated (soft), etc.), especially when things get 'busy'.   The key word here is "simplicity".<br><br>Secondly, I think one of the keys will have to do with what Alan and others have already hit on with "Actives".  If you can clearly see at a glance what has been started today (and yesterday), great things can happen with momentum, continuity, etc., and many of our problems we have had in the past will disappear.</div>

<div class="content">"making it simpler, not more complicated."  <br><br>Unfortunately, making it simpler is more complicated than making it more complicated.  I'm trying and flailing. :-)</div>

<div class="content">Adding a rule tends to mostly preserve the system's behavior.  Subtracting a rule tends to blow everything up because there are no surplus rules.  So this requires a whole additional process of deeply thinking through the effects and trying it out, while considering what to do about the hole introduced into the system.  It's definitely more complicated.</div>

<div class="content">Alan:<br><br>The simplicity we want is in the practice of the system, not in the rules of the system. This simplicity does not necessarily involve subtracting rules.</div>

<div class="content">Alan:  Some very good comments, as usual, over the last few days.  Regarding complexity, and your discussion with Seraphim, could you see a type of waxing and waning Actives/Day Plan?  <br><br>The Actives page would start with nada, and wax (grow) throughout the day.  This would serve as a daily record and also have other benefits as discussed recently.<br><br>The facing page would contain the must-do's for the day, and would be closed (with new/urgent tasks below a line), and would wane throughout the day (to zero).  They would be crossed out as they are actually started and transferred over to the waxing side.</div>

<div class="content">It's a reasonable idea BKK.  However, as a feature it gets in the way of other features peculiar to my implementation. So I won't.</div>
