<div class="content">Dear all,<br><br>I have been using DWM since February 8 in an electric format and found that it works completely fine.  As mentioned elsewhere, DWM has more capacity/potential than AFs in that it can handle backlogs much better.<br><br>My gut feeling tells me that DWM may handle delegated tasks well, too.  However, I am still wondering how I can do this efficiently.  If you could share any tips (e.g. tagging) in this regad, it would be appreciated.</div>

<div class="content">I use it for delegated tasks. I add them as I would any task, and use them as a prompt to follow up on the task if no action has occurred. If action has but it is not complete it I add it at today+7.</div>

<div class="content">mit,<br><br>I came to Mark Forster initially from a post about him on David Allen's website. So, I consider most of my delegated tasks as "waiting fors," i.e., I am waiting for someone else to do something. One thing I love about electronic implementations is that I can have a field which holds information on other people. That way, for example, if John calls me on the phone, while I am talking to him I can filter my list for his name and then I can ask him for updates on the five things he promised to do for me.<br><br>I think DWM works well for this. At least once a week I will contact the person to ask them to update the status on whatever it is they are supposed to be doing.</div>

<div class="content">My list tells me what to do, so if I delegate a task, that's an action, it moves to next week, and is rewritten to say who's working on it.  <br><br>If the thing comes back to me done, I can easily find it among the 30-60 things on this week and next week.<br><br>If I see the task again and want to know progress, I will check up on progress.  This system forces me to not let anything slide more than a week so it's perfect.</div>

<div class="content">Thank you for all of your comments, folks.  Taken together, all I need to do is just to put delegated tasks in the list.  It automatically gives a week time frame, which is appropriate to see progress in most cases.<br><br>I have been using "ask someone to do something" method in AF/DWM, but I haven't used "follow up someone's something" method.  Instead, I have a list of delegated tasks (since I began time management system with GTD).<br><br>Now I will give a try to this "follow up" method for a while and feed back here.</div>

<div class="content">I keep a Waiting For list and a repeating reminder in my list to Chase Waiting For Items.</div>

<div class="content">I stick the name of the responsible party at the front: "Jim: fix world hunger" and then treat it as a normal task, with my action being to follow up when it seems right.</div>

<div class="content">I'm using Outlook Tasks to manage my DWM list.  For delegated tasks, I add a "category".  I have 2 main category groups.  One set for projects so that I can aggregate tasks across a project (useful when checking plans and preparing progress updates).  Another set is delegated/my team.  Like moises, when I'm with someone I can easily look at tasks related to that person as a reminder.  This is not just delegated tasks, but also "talk about X" and "arrange meeting with Y" type tasks that I have not yet actioned.<br><br>I use various views in my Outlook task list - the main DWM view is set to show only tasks that havent expired, and are within a month of expiry.  I use Outlook's "due date" field as the expiry date - I can happily ignore the fact that it doesnt have anything to do with the real task "due date".</div>

<div class="content">I feel a bit sorry for Jim, that's a project that needs breaking down into smaller tasks.</div>

<div class="content">SimonW,<br><br>Yes, but I leave that to Jim: he's a capable guy and I don't want to micromanage the detail. With any delegation, I try to delegate a clearly defined outcome and leave the detailed method.</div>

<div class="content">That's good Will, and I'm sure none of your delegation is quite the scale of Jim's task, yet if it's anything more difficult than routine labour "clearly defined outcome" is only the start of project delegation.  If Jim is capable, then he knows things about the project you don't, and can help you refine the detail.  There will need to be discussion including things like cost, time, quality and ongoing discussion of progress and direction.</div>

<div class="content">Alan,<br><br>Quite right, of course. I would see quality as part of the outcome, but you need to be clear about constraints and on-going communication (which often feels like a constraint!).<br><br>My point was really that I would expect Jim, as an experienced guy, to deliver what is agreed within the constraints. I'd expect metrics showing that he is on course (after all, I have given a commitment), but I wouldn't do his planning for him or expect him to share every detail.</div>

<div class="content">If a project is complex, you don't need every detail of *how* it's done, but it takes ongoing communication to establish the details, avoid misunderstanding, and be available for Jim's suggested changes to improve the outcome.</div>
