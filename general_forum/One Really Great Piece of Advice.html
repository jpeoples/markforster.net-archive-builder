<div class="content">What if a coworker or friend asked you about AF?  After telling them how it works you might say, "One of the key things I've found is..." Is what?  Would you mind sharing your great piece(s) of advice?<br><br>How about one piece of advice per post, followed by a *short* explanation.  If you have more than one great piece of advice, put them in separate posts.  Thanks!</div>

<div class="content">Projects unfold right in front of you.<br><br>You don't have to define every step of a project. You can even start with no more than "Get started on XYZ". The first time you take action on that vaguely worded task you do some little bit, and when you're done you know what the next step is. Write that next step at the end of your list. Later that day or later that week, you'll do some work on that next step and, when you've finished it, you know what the next next-step will be. In this way the project unfolds as you move along.</div>
