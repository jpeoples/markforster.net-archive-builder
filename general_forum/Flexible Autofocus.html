<div class="content">I was reading an old Evernote capture from the forums and saw the letters "FAF." Could not remember for the life of me what it stood for. <br><br>Searching this site, I found this post:<br><br><a href="../blog/Flexible Autofocus.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2017/1/9/flexible-autofocus.html</a><br><br>At the time, it caused a bit of excitement on the forums: <a href="../general_forum/Stop the presses! Flexible Autofocus is here!.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2653333</a><br><br>Just surfacing it here because I did not see it on the comprehensive list of TM Systems and, well, the Lenten Challenge ends soon so maybe folks want to revisit old favorites for an Eastertide challenge?</div>

<div class="content">I think Mark experimented with it just recently as well. I think it's an elegant solution to increasing the flexibility of the system while preserving the concept of the closed list. I've found myself naturally gravitating towards doing something like it when I'm doing simple scanning and going around the list starts to get tedious.</div>

<div class="content">I don't see any reason to use it over Simple Scanning myself.</div>
