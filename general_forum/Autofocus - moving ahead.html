<div class="content">What do you do if items stand out - but you don't want to do them at the moment? In other words on my first page I have a couple of tasks that are going to take some considerable time and I just don't feel like even starting them now - though they do stand out.  On my next pages I have a lot of items I would quite happily make a start on.  Should I just move ahead and come back to the first page? Should I dismiss the items (not ideal because they need to be done)? Cross them out and add them to the end of list? <br><br>I think I may have not quite understood the concept - I suspect the idea is to move ahead in a fluid motion as such, then revisit the first page. Is that more of the general idea. I think at the moment I am a bit stalled on the first page because of these items I don't feel like doing. <br><br>All the best<br><br>Steve</div>

<div class="content">Yes, I think you have misunderstood the concept a bit.<br><br>I suggest you look at my two "Clarification" blog posts, one on Speed of Movement and the other on Standing Out. Then read the instructions again.</div>
