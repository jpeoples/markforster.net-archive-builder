<div class="content">I am slowly clearing a backlog of papers on my desk.  After months of little progress, I am making headway now because I have realised that I will never get anywhere doing it when it stands out on a SuperFocus list.  I do weed the heap periodically, but paper comes in faster than I process it, so it piles up.<br><br>Rather, I have to change my habits so that processing the pile becomes a natural activity.  I've realised that I leave my desk several times a day, for lunch, meetings, getting tea, and, most of all, relieving myself of the burden of said tea.<br><br>I have managed to form a habit that whenever I return to my desk from any break, I process at least two items from the paper mountain.  Often, I get sucked in and handle more than two.<br><br>I'm finding that this trick brings a rhythm of a natural kind to getting a current initiative advanced.</div>

<div class="content">Made me smile David - excellent idea!  I'm busy forming new habits as we speak as I think this is key to being productive!</div>

<div class="content">I've taken to taking 30 minute breaks after every 90 minutes, for a timeout at 10,12,14,1600h.  Those 30 minute breaks are partly relax, but also partly do little work things that otherwise build up: papers on the desk, AF backlog, discuss status with workers, stretch muscles.<br><br>Keeps work fresh and productive.</div>

<div class="content">Suggest you use the backlog method which I have consistently recommended over the years:<br><br>1. Move the backlog out of sight and mind.<br><br>2. Work at your system for dealing with new stuff until you are confident that you can keep up. <br><br>3. Then, and only then, start to clear the backlog.<br><br>Step 2 must come before step 3 otherwise you will always be in the situation you describe.</div>

<div class="content">Mark: I'm not sure if you are addressing David or me. <br><<2. Work at your system for dealing with new stuff until you are confident that you can keep up. >><br>For my case, I think this item has already been achieved. But perhaps there is a red flag in my scheme that I'm not seeing. One addendum to my post: The two-hour marks are flexible. Actual break times vary according to the day's flow.</div>

<div class="content">I regret identifying backlog clearance as the context for my posting.  It distracted attention from a finding that I had hoped might be useful to others, that associating a desired habit change to pee breaks is proving to be useful and not something I'd seen mentioned before.</div>

<div class="content">DavidC:<br><br>Yes, I used to use this a lot when coaching people (though not in the context of pee breaks!). Any routine action, especially one which takes one out of one's normal work station can be associated with other actions, which would otherwise be neglected.<br><br> So you can build up a repertoire of little sub-routines. <br><br>For example, if you keep going into the kitchen to make yourself a cup of coffee, always deal with anything that needs washing-up. Keep a list of things you can pick up at the convenience store when you walk past it on the way to work. And so on.</div>
