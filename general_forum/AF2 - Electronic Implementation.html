<div class="content">Rather than clutter up Mark's AF2 blog posting with an electronic implementation discussion, I've taken the liberty to start this thread...<br><br>Firstly, thanks very much for AF2, Mark - I can feel right away this approach removes the major worry of having must-do-now tasks hidden away on other task pages.<br><br>It seems much less fuss to implement electronically than AF1...if your ToDo List software allows you a "natural" sort order where it defaults to putting the last task entered at the top of your electronic list, but then allows you to drag tasks around to customize the order.<br><br>I have created a marker task to use to drag down to where the "unactioned task block" begins. i.e. a task named ">>>>".<br><br>Of course, you will need to leave completed items on show to see where the first contiguous "on notice for dismissal" tasks block begins. My software dims the completed items so it is fairly clear what is active and what is not.<br><br>On completing a task, mark it as complete but then make an immediate copy and paste it back into the ToDo list. My software automatically then creates a clean new task with the same name at the top of the list.<br><br>You will need another task marker (say, a task named "*******" ) to drag to mark where the dismissed tasks begin. Anything below that marker is considered dismissed.<br><br>I already have an electronic implementation working on my Blackberry...seems pretty slick so far...though obviously haven't dismissed anything yet. :)</div>

<div class="content">Just a further little tip...<br><br>If your ToDo software has the ability to automatically create tasks with default settings, then set it so that your tasks are created to regenerate themselves automatically on completion.<br><br>Saves you having to manually recreate a task in the list once you've done a bit of work on it and marked it complete for now.<br><br>When you finally finish the task, just delete the automatically regenerated task from your list.</div>

<div class="content">And that's why TaskPaper will shine with this system. It has all the simplicity of a Text dox, but with the functionality of an e-to do list. <br><br>For Task Paper users, I'm going to use the tag @Dismiss marker after the last unactioned task to replace the: "draw a line right across it after the first block of unactioned tasks"</div>

<div class="content">Frank, as a software junky, I am of course already thinking about how to implement AF2 using my iPhone. One way of automatically re-adding tasks that I've tried is to make the tasks repeating daily. The only thing I don't like about this is it gives the task a due date in every software program I've tried. I use due dates in my electronic AF list for a purpose so that gets messy. Rather than actually crossing it off, you could also just drag it to the end of the list in many software programs.<br><br>Appigo's To Do and Toodledo would allow you to star all tasks that are up for dismissal. What's pretty neat about ToDo is that you can also add projects or checklists to your list. Listomni could be used with AF2 using the comments to mark tasks up for dismissal. I believe all these programs allow you to continue to see the tasks you've completed making the "line drawing" simple. To dismiss tasks, you could either add them to a separate category of dismissed or what's truer to paper is you could assign them low priority whereas none of the other tasks would have a priority assignment or they could all have the same higher priority.</div>

<div class="content">Unfortunately, after a few hours use, I am finding that the software I am using for my Blackberry (ToDo Matrix) is proving to be a bit unreliable as far as "natural" sort orders is concerned. A newly-created task sometimes does not go to the top of the list, so I am finding I am having to manually fiddle with the task list order too much.<br><br>As another electronic approach to AF2 (which some might find works better), I am now enforcing a sort order of the main task list by creation date (newest first).<br><br>And I have created a separate tasks folder called "On Notice" for tasks that I will identify tomorrow as being in the "about to be dismissed" block. I'll move the eligible tasks in there at the start of the day. And I've added a task to my main ToDo list to "Review tasks in On Notice folder".<br><br>I have also created a separate tasks folder called "Dismissed" and will move any untouched "On Notice" tasks into there at the appropriate time, while refilling the "On Notice" folder at the same time with new tasks eligible for dismissal.<br><br>This approach has the added advantage of keeping Dismissed tasks separate from your main task list.</div>

<div class="content">Or just tag them with a nice amber "at risk" category in the main list. (Works in Outlook on PC, one click). Then you don't need to add a marker line task.</div>

<div class="content">Another little tip.<br><br>You can hide completed tasks during the day to keep your task list clean. You only need to see them at the start of the day to identify the "On Notice" tasks.</div>

However, I've been trying to avoid using any properties of the "On Notice" tasks as identifiers (such as category, status, colour etc) because when you re-create those tasks (if you don't complete them), you'll have to reset those properties manually...unless your software does it for you.</div>

<div class="content">I've been using OmniFocus to handle my AF1 stuff in the following way:<br>Create multiple pages (Page 1, 2, 3, etc.)<br>Each page can hold up to 35 items, when that page is full I've been marking it as completed and renumbering the pages<br>When I work on an item I move it to the last page in my list<br>I've been keeping track of which page I'm currently on by labeling it as CURRENT then updating that as I've been moving through my list<br><br>Now, I'm wondering what the best way to implement AF2 is going to be for me. I've found in OmniFocus that I can color tasks, so I do have a way to highlight "To be dismissed" tasks, but the figuring out of where I should draw the line is where I'm getting stuck.<br><br>Should I :<br>a) keep one big page?<br>b) keep separate pages as I'm doing now?<br><br>Here are the advantages/disadvantages of each.<br>One big page:<br>- Everything is easily accessible<br>- I can scan through it whenever I want (on the iPhone or on my laptop or at work)<br>- Disadvantage: when I want to figure out where I need to dismiss items I'll have to turn on "Show all completed tasks" which could be alot if they never get fully dismissed<br><br>Several smaller pages:<br>- Not as easy to go through the list to do stuff<br>- But much easier to look at in terms of what will get dismissed<br><br>What does everyone think?</div>

<div class="meta">2009-06-27 22:29</div>
<div class="content">Ok, I think I've come up with a solution that works for both iPhone and Laptop. Essentially I still keep multiple pages. With the new iPhone I can look at all available tasks within a folder (which is how I have AF1 setup now) and I can "Flag" an item for dismissal. So, when reviewing it's easy to see what's remaining on a page and mark those items as flagged. Then the next day I can move them off of my list to a Someday/Maybe list (or alternatively I can keep them so I can review - either way I'll review them as I have a task on my list to review projects/Someday/Maybe).<br><br>This keeps my list pruned and isn't a big change.</div>

<div class="content">Warner, I honestly don't know what is the best for you. What I am doing is trying AF2 as written (except electronically). If I don't like it, I will revert back.<br><br>Frank, GREAT tip about not keeping the completed tasks visible except when you need to draw the line. <br><br>I have investigated on the iPhone some and have determined that Appigo ToDo doesn't work for AF2 because it automatically repositions completed tasks to the bottom of the list. It doesn't appear that you can sort by creation date to override that. Please someone let me know if you see how you can.<br><br>Toodledo's native iPhone app DOES work for AF2. I think the stars would work very well for noting tasks ready to be dismissed. Those that are then actually dismissed could easily be assigned negative priority and you can choose to view or not view them.<br><br>Listomni's software also works beautifully with AF2. This is probably the app I will use. To easily mark tasks up for dismissal, simply write in the comment line "Up for dismissal." You can multi-edit items very quickly and add this phrase (use copy and paste if you like) to the whole block. Dismissed tasks will have low priority in this system. The ONLY disadvantage I have seen with this app is that while it's the fastest typing app on the iphone since you only need type a couple of letters to pull up a list of possible tasks you've previously entered, you will have to choose the option of "Keep both" when it inquires about the duplicate tasks. This can clog up the software and slow it down eventually. In original AF, there was no reason for me to see completed tasks so I would just hit delete when I added a duplicate task to the list.</div>

<div class="content">Will,<br><br>I'm inclined to agree with your approach about adding a property to the "On Notice" tasks, which keeps them in the same master list.<br><br>Having just drawn my first "On Notice" line, it feels much better to have all the "On Notice" tasks in the same list. Unfortunately, my software doesn't allow anything like a colour-change (yet), so I've just prefixed the "On Notice" tasks with "***" and they stand out quite nicely in the master task list.<br><br>I think it's probably a minor inconvenience to remove the prefix when recreating the task - and it will obvious in the task list if I forget.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-06-28 10:33</div>
<div class="content">Just another little tip (again!)...if you are sorting your task list by "creation date (most recent first)", just switch the sort order to "creation date (oldest first)" to make it easy to read through your task list at the start of the day per the AF2 instructions.<br><br>...and obviously switch it back again afterwards :)</div>

<div class="meta">2009-06-28 13:34</div>
<div class="content">Been thinking it over and there seems to be a way to improve on the paper version of AF2 in an electronic approach.<br><br>At the start of the day after you've identified the "On Notice" tasks for the day, add a property to them such as a different colour, a text prefix (e.g. "***"), a different status or category or whatever is necessary to make them stand out from other tasks on your main task list.<br><br>Then simply re-create these tasks at the top of the task list. Takes just a keystroke to do on my Blackberry PDA.<br><br>Now you have the advantage of the "On Notice" tasks being towards the top of your list throughout the day together with your urgent/must-do tasks...seems like the best of both worlds.<br><br>Once any of these "On Notice" tasks are done, just remove the property you added earlier and re-add to the start of the list so they look like ordinary tasks again...since the task has now escaped being "On Notice".<br><br>Tomorrow morning, any "On Notice" tasks that are not touched are moved into a "Dismissed tasks" folder or filtered out of the main task list, or whatever your preferred method of dealing with them is.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-06-28 13:42</div>
<div class="content">Sorry for hogging this thread.... :)<br><br>...but I don't see why the above wouldn't work for a paper approach too. Just rewrite the "On Notice" tasks at the end of your paper task list (as though they have just been added) with, say, an asterisk next to them to identify they are now "On Notice".<br><br>Doesn't that take away the worry that some people are expressing of not giving them enough attention during the day because they are right at the beginning of the paper task list?</div>

<div class="content">Avrum,<br><br>I have just started using Task Paper as well.  I like it.  I run my list with newest at the top, which is easier to work.  I am going to use a dashed line (separate task) to mark the potentially dismissed tasks.  If I do dismiss a task (or more) than I will tag it dismissed and mark it done (tag it done).  Then when I come to the task "check dismissed items" I can do a quick search on the dismissed tag.</div>

<div class="content">Just a few further thoughts:<br><br>I'm a Mac user, and I'd ideally be able to set things up so that I can work my AF2 list from either my laptop or my iPhone (and keep the two in sync, of course). I also don't want to use a web-based app. I've been using Things for a while now, and had used it successfully with both DIT and (as I described in an old thread on this forum) AF. But AF2 – which looks great to me, although I haven't *really* started using it yet – throws a spanner in the works. There's no problem with running an AF2 list on my laptop alone; the problem is that the iPhone app forces you to move completed items to the "logbook" either daily, or every time you open it (your choice); on syncing, all completed items then get moved to the logbook on the desktop app, too. And this means that the approach to dismissal is going to get screwed up, because batches of uncompleted items are going to get clumped together on a regular basis, with the result that my earliest batch of uncompleted items each day is going to be way too big. (In the worst case, if I have my whole list on one page, and sync regularly, the earliest batch is always going to contain *all uncompleted items*! Dividing the list up over a collection of "pages" (as I of course did with AF) reduces the severity of the problem somewhat, but there's still a problem.)<br><br>(The desktop version of Things can be set up to move completed items to the logbook automatically, and you have a choice of frequencies; but you can also disable that function just by unchecking a box in the preferences. So it's really only an issue if you want to use the iPhone app, either on its own or in combination with the desktop version.)<br><br>I've looked at The Hit List and Taskpaper, too, but neither of those has an iPhone app as yet, so at this point, they're equivalent to Things with respect to this issue (in that I could use any one to run AF2 provided I'm willing to run it entirely from my laptop). Listomni is iPhone only. I know there's Omnifocus, but I hate the thought of spending $70 on that (with my educator's discount – $100 without that discount, for both the desktop and the iPhone app!) when I already own Things and The Hit List. I've written to the developers of Things, and they say they've had a few other requests for manual logging of tasks on the iPhone, so you never know. They wanted to know why I want that, so I've pointed them towards AF2....<br><br>Anyway, as I say, just a few further thoughts to throw into the mix.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">I'm using Things for iPhone to implement AF2:<br><br>Pros:<br><br>- new tasks are automatically added to the top of the list<br>- you can drag and drop tasks which makes positioning an 'on notice' line simple<br>- tasks that cannot be started today can be scheduled for a future date and remain hidden from view until they pop up at the top of your list on their start date, reducing list clutter. <br>- tasks with due dates are highlighted in red up to two weeks in advance of their deadline, which provides a little help for your intuition.<br>- dismissed tasks can be moved to a separate list, making it easy to isolate and identify them for review.<br>- completed tasks are automatically moved to a logbook on the following day where they can be reviewed for possible follow-up. A pop-up notification tells you how many tasks we're moved when the app is first launched each day.<br>- a notification badge on the iPhone's home screen tells you how many overdue/urgent items are on your list.<br>- task entry is relatively quick and painless<br>- you can add tags to tasks and then filter your tasks by tag. I find this particularly useful for errands, as it makes them easy to isolate when I am out and about.           <br><br>Cons: <br><br>Repeating tasks aren't created automatically, you have to reschedule them manually.<br><br>Tips: <br><br>The AF2 instructions say: "At the BEGINNING of each day, go to your oldest active page, and draw a line after the first block of unactioned tasks..."<br><br>Because of the way Things logs completed items, it is best to "draw" this line at the END of each day and to dismiss the previous days on notice tasks at the same time.       </div>

<div class="content">EXPERIMENT: AF1 ELECTRONIC VERSION<br><br>I used my vacation as an opportunity to try an electronic implementation of AF1. It was a working vacation as I was doing voluntary work for a charity - so I still had a healthy work-load to 'stress' the AF system. But I had been too afraid to damage my productivity at work with this new approach - the paper based system was working so well.<br><br>I wont go into all with the implementation details - I used my blackberry mostly and synchronised its task-list with Outlook on my laptop. I had spent some time figuring out a good 'notation' to use to preserve the key properties of my AF1 pages on both the blackberry and on outlook. Then on my first day of vacation I typed in all the items on my AF list and left my notebook behind as I headed off. The nature of our journey made the use of the blackberry much better than a big paper notebook - and each night I synched with my laptop and could review the lists in a larger format.<br><br>I developed a lot of really neat tricks for looking at my list in various ways - I could query a persons name and see all the stuff pertaining to that person (or company, or location, or context etc). I could put reminders on things and colour-code the display based on those. I was able to sort, slice and dice the list any way I liked - and I frequently did. In fact I spent more time looking at my tasks then I did getting them done.<br><br>So in the end the experiment was a failure. My productivity declined to what it used to be before AF! Procrastination of resisted tasks became a huge problem. Not because I was on vacation. Not because of any limitation of the blackberry or the list software. When I switched back to a paper system a few days ago, I experienced a productivity boost straight away. Sigh.<br><br>I am a geek and a techie - I just LOVE gadgets and electronic tools. I can do things with spread-sheets you wouldn't believe. But when it comes to getting things done - the electronic version seems to get in the way instead of helping!<br><br>So I look closely at what happens when I use a paper system. Something about the ritual and the physicality of the pages allows my subconscious and intuitive mind to filter out and focus on the right things, overcome my tendency to procrastinate and not get lost in endless analysis and prioritising and re-organising - I just get on with the tasks!<br><br>I envy you who can make this work using the latest eletronic devices and software - I love that stuff - but for me its back to the notebook and pen.<br><br>I am implementing AF2 today - starting over with a blank book - so I will only use my blackberry for emails, calendar and as a short-term note-taker - the real AF2 list will be in my trusty hard-backed A4 notebook.<br><br>At least I tried and now I need wonder no more. Thanks to everyone here for their advice on implementing an electronic AF system. And a BIG thank you to Mark for his wisdom and generosity in making AF1 and AF2 available to us.<br><br>Paul<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Thanks for your fascinating posting, Paul - it's nice to get an alternative viewpoint from a fellow techie.<br><br>I guess I am one of those odd characters that is able to make an electronic approach work quite well...but then again, I find it much easier to read books off a computer screen than on paper also - which I know many would probably not understand. (It helps to have a spare wide-screen monitor dedicated just for that purpose rotated into "portrait mode").<br><br>Among other things, I write computer software professionally so probably have more interest in technology than the average person.<br><br>I appreciate what you say about the tactile nature of paper however I find the paper approach just doesn't move fast enough for my mind - and it becomes frustrating very quickly. Being one of those creative types, I often find I cannot write fast or legibly enough to keep up with the frequent thought-stream bursts, and yet typing - even on a PDA - isn't a problem. (The mind-mapping software MindManager is probably my most-used non-tasks application)<br><br>I'm also using a Blackberry (Bold 9000) but not the inbuilt-tasks application (which I find pretty rubbish) but a piece of software called ToDoMatrix, which in my implementation of AF2, makes the system slick and easy to use, and takes that element of "slowness" frustration away. The downside is that I cannot use the desktop side of ToDoMatrix because it lacks a feature that I am currently heavily reliant on in the PDA version...though I understand there may be a major desktop upgrade before the end of the year.<br><br>Good luck with the paper AF2 implementation!</div>

<div class="content">Trevor:<br><br>The tip you mention at the end of your post – putting tasks on notice at the end of each day, rather than the beginning – had occurred to me, but note that it's only a partial solution to the problem I described. It will avoid the worst case result of having the earliest block of unactioned tasks contain *all* your unactioned tasks; but the earliest block is still likely be a different block, and a bigger one, than it would be if no logging had taken place on previous days. (On paper, as Mark envisages AF2 in the first instance, there is no equivalent of logging, of course.) And that probably means either that more tasks are going to get dismissed than would be if you were working the system on paper, or that there'll be more pressure to keep moving to the early part of the list as quickly as possible to prevent dismissal, thus leaving less room for dealing with recently arrived but urgent tasks. Of course, it's possible that the difference won't make a difference to the effectiveness of the system, or even that it will improve it (for all I know); but it's definitely not going to be working in the way Mark intends. And my own preference is to try the system the way Mark's designed it first (just because I tend to trust him on this stuff, given my past experiences with his ideas, and with tweaking them).<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Avrum,<br><br>Yes, I'd gathered that. The Hit List is supposed to have an iPhone app coming, too, at some point. One question, of course, is whether either iPhone app will avoid the problem I've described with the iPhone app for Things. I've pretty much ruled TaskPaper out on other grounds, though, in any case. As far as I can tell, it can't handle repeating tasks without getting into AppleScript. Things and The Hit List (and, I'm guessing, Omnifocus) also let you schedule tasks and reminders for future dates without having them appear in your current list (so, for example: renew my daughter's passport in the first half of 2014, to take a relatively extreme example), whereas TaskPaper doesn't seem to allow that. And I must confess that I just find the look of TaskPaper too unappealing, compared to the competition – not just less pretty, but actually harder to read (including the way it handles notes, and it's not that infrequently that I want to attach notes to my tasks, reminding what I want to email someone about, or what someone's phone number is, etc.).<br></div>

<div class="content">Not an exact reply to Martin, but I hope this tip helps solve the problem.<br><br>Let me share my set up that has worked really well for AF1 and is working even better for AF2. Here it goes:<br>1.	I chose a simple outline program with check box function rather than a “to do” or GTD program. (Since I use iPhone, mine is CarbonFin Outliner, but any other outline program with check box should work.) <br>2.	I created just two parent headings: Action and Archive.<br>3.	Under Action, I simply enter the list of “actionable” items, just like in a notebook, although I do limit the number of items to 32 (an arbitrary number simulating the lines of a typical notebook). After Item #32, I simply create another Action (1. Action, 2. Action, etc.) heading. -- Under AF1, this created the closed-list effect. Under AF2, I kept this practice as it makes archiving easier.<br>4.	After this setup, all I have to do is to do AF2: read through the list backwards, read again to do what stands out, dismiss, etc. I check off the completed items. For dismissing, I change the unchecked check box into a plain bullet. In this way, the “Hide completed items” function only shows either the non-completed or the dismissed items.<br>5.	In the morning, I undo the “Hide completed items” to identify the dismissal candidate block and mark the last item of the block with something very visible. (I use the Emoji up arrow). <br>6.	After the 32 items in one heading are either completed or dismissed, I change the heading from “Action” to a completed date (e.g., 6/29/09) and move it under “Archive.” <br>The beauty of this is that it is basically an exact duplicate of the notebook method with several advantages:<br>- It keeps the list cleaner: I can use the “Hide completed items” function to see just the “actionable” (and dismissed) items. <br>- Reentry is a breeze: just duplicate the item, check off the original, and move the duplicated one to the bottom.<br>- Reviewing of the dismissed items is also a breeze. Under the Archive heading, the “Hide completed items” function allows me to see just the dismissed items. My software also automatically records the entry and the completion date of an item for future reference.<br><br>Now I can check off "Post AF forum." ;)<br></div>

<div class="content">hi i just wish to speak about the using of Omnifocus implementation wich is near an outliner<br><br>this fternoon i have posted this thread <br>"Hi all <br>As you know i am not really a jeek but i red this article and found it very interesting. The author seems to love autofocus and he tried to adapt it on the terrific Omnifocus. <br>Here is the link to read that. <br><a href="http://www.pda-247.com/wordpress/2009/06/omnifocus-15-for-iphone-review/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pda-247.com/wordpress/2009/06/omnifocus-15-for-iphone-review/</a><br><br>So as i have OF i decided to try it and see if may be AF2 method could work with it. <br>It seems to be... incredible no ? <br><br>of course i have simplifie dissmissing tasks just in creating a context dissmiss. The method of dissmissing thing can work except that each item dissmiss must be changed as a context dissmiss<br><br>I did that because of the convenience of omnifocus and as i have an iphone it works so well with it."<br><br>The result of my day working with it is very interesting. <br><br>1. I have created a FOLDER called Autofocus with projects Page 1, page 2, page 3<br>2. I have created a conted call "dissmiss"<br>3. I keps all my projects as they were grouped by AREAS and FOLDERS<br>mine are 1.  Business, 2. négociation, 3. Work, 4. Company (taxes and so on) 5. Home<br>6.People 7. GTD and process<br><br>Why is it so interesting <br>1) i can work by project imagine what i want to do<br>2) I can work by context phone and so on<br>3) I can work with autofocus How ? <br>- Just drag and drop from project what you have to do to page one (this is my today active page) on page 2 i put all stuff i want to do if i can, page 3 is for tomorrow<br>- During the day i am focus on page one. I add items like on a note book at the end. If i plan to do it tomorrow i just put it in page 3, if i dont know if i will do something or not it goes on page 2<br>When something is done it goes at night on the project (then i have my archive)<br><br>The interesing is the way i work on my project list and mostly on page 1 et 2 <br>I use Mark Forster AF2 ! from dow to up. If i add something it is automaticaly added at the end. Then i do it or no if it stands at me. <br><br>If i need to call people i can go to my context list the i can work at a GTD manner. <br><br>My context dissmiss show me all what is dissmiss. I can choose then to cross it or to plan it someday. <br><br>But the real interest is with the iphone<br><br>i can have my list every where, i have my errand list too wich is quiet easy for shopping i can work on a project everywhere, i can use my intuition for selecting items and dissmissing them. Also there are none duplicate items. <br><br>The difficulty is to write items with a minimum off words (it is more easy with the iphone for reading !)<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Cixelsyd. Good point about looking at Outliners. CarbonFin (which I didn't know) looks nice, but seems editable only on the iPhone, whereas I want to edit in both places (and mostly on my laptop, in fact), so it doesn't quite solve my particular problem, but nice idea anyway. <br><br>Incidentally, I just remembered LifeBalance, which I was using for a while some time ago (before I came across Mark's ideas). I still have a licence, and they have an iPhone app. Maybe that would work, if I disable the function which is their special selling point (that the program looks at how you want to balance your life between various areas, and reorders your list for as you go along to prompt you to stay in balance).</div>

<div class="content">Martin:<br><br>I don’t recommend LifeBalance, unless you enjoy knocking the door with your head: it can be done, but it will hurt. I bought and used LB, OmniFocus, and Things. (Like Mel, I’m a software junkie! I can go all the way back of Pilot 1000, or, even better, Borland Sidekick on my 8088 PC clone!)  You’ll have to “back-tweak” them to get around their complexity and make them do something very, very simple. <br><br>When I started AF1, like Paul above, I eventually abandon them all for a notebook and a pen. However, I encountered two main problems: 1) the portability-“writability” tradeoff -- small notebooks are portable but very hard to write on; large notebooks are easier to write on but hard to carry --, and 2) the illegible handwriting syndrome. Then I thought to myself,  “I have an iPhone in my pocket all the time. Can’t I use it like an AF notebook?” That led me to a simple outline program.<br><br>You’re correct: you cannot directly edit the CarbonFin outline with your computer, although you can import and export opml files through its web app (Outliner Online). For this reason, I may migrate to TaskPaper once its iPhone app is complete. Or, CarbonFin may come up with an editable app. <br><br>Best.<br></div>

<div class="content">Cixelsyd:<br><br>Yes, after I'd spent a few minutes refreshing my memory about how LifeBalance works, I came to the same conclusion. For now I'm playing with both Things and The Hit List. (I have a lot of momentum with Things, and really like all sorts of things about it, but I *love* the face that you can do so much with keyboard shortcuts on THL.) As I said earlier, I'm not crazy about TaskPaper, but if they're the first of the three to come up with an iPhone app that works for AF2, with regular syncing, I'll look at them again. And CarbonFin does look nice, so if they come up with a desktop app, that would be a candidate, too. And then there's always the possibility that I'll end up resigning myself to spending the money on Omnifocus....<br><br>Best,<br><br>Martin</div>

<div class="content">Ok let's try that again iphone didn't want to submit post.<br><br>I'm currently committed to trying AF2 no paper until the end of August just to get a solid feel for the pacing and performance of the system. I won't use an electronic version fulltime until after then; but that does mean I can prepare to try later....<br><br>Like others I have TaskPaper and the beta iphone version. It seems to be a nature fit for both AF1 and AF2 as far as a software version of the method. I'm just not sure that it can beat the speed and reliability of paper (especially since cut and paste was added my iphone is a LOT slower to type on).<br><br>Anyhow the beauty of TaskPaper is that it's flat and free form for the most part;  and with the AppleScript available it should be possible to make an AF1 & AF2 tool bundle that runs on top of it.<br><br>The question remains what scripts would be useful; input from all is requested:<br><br>Both versions<br>1) Mark the current task as worked on and re-add to the end of the list<br>2) Create an entry for the current email message in apple mail<br>3) Create an entry for the current URL at the end of the list from safari<br><br>AF1: <br>1) Create new page<br>2) Resize window to show XX number of lines<br>3) Dismiss page and archive (hmm how show it be archived)<br>4) Repaginate the existing notebook to have pages of XX lines of length <br><br>AF2:<br>1) Jump to end of list<br>2) Check off current item and jump to end of list<br>3) Dismiss yesterday's tasks and move the line to the next correct location <br>3a) Move Dismissed and completed to a date based archive organized by??? Month  Week??/<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">ratz - another option would be to work off a printed copy of a list, and update Taskpaper every few days.</div>

<div class="content">Just a tip to those who are hiding completed items during the day in their electronic systems...<br><br>I am finding it quite helpful to flick on "show completed items" briefly at the end of the day if I happen to be near the bottom of the list. This lets me get an advanced warning if I am going to be deluged with "on notice" tasks the next day. It also provides a last chance to try and break up that block a bit.</div>

<div class="content">Ratz<br>I use TaskPaper and I have new items entered at the top of the list.  I find it much easier to work down the list during the day, then work up.  My "divider line" is therefore above the lowest (oldest) block of unactioned tasks.</div>
