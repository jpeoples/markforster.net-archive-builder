<div class="content">Going to work is the type of task I have in mind. What happens is you're processing things to do, then you leave for work, and the home list is dropped. Later you return from work and pick up where you dropped off.<br><br>Now going to work typically starts with preparation (grab lunch, grab laptop). Returning requires unpacking and putting away.<br><br>Here's the new thought: all this is in SF terms, one task "work". When time comes to head for the office, this work task is forwarded to the next page as unfinished.  When you get home, you finish the task in putting stuff away. <br><br>The above idea also applies to shopping, sleeping, vacationing, working all morning in the woodshop, playing football.</div>

<div class="content">Alan, Erik,<br>IMHO and as in other posts discussed it depends on how complete day-to-day tasks has to be transfered to SF or other lists - this doubtless is different for everybody.<br><br>For myself I feel it's quite an obstacle to put things like lunch, work, dishes, hovering, playing with kids and so on on the list. <br>Why? Because they stand-out naturally...<br><br>Maybe some balance get lost, but it makes things less complicated.</div>

<div class="content">Alan, <br><br>Subtle! So you're saying define the task to include preparation and postparation to make sure the postparation gets done. I like it! <br><br>Even if you do end up copying "work" to every new page as you do more. Actually, that is a feature I really like, as it encourages you to zone better. So perhaps relevant to home-workers as well,</div>

<div class="content">Like Jens says, is it useful to put all your day to day tasks?<br>But reading Will's post, I now think the concept may be useful too!</div>

<div class="content">This is an idea.  I'm not entirely sure how or when it's usable, but it's interesting nonetheless.  At present I don't have the tasks I mentioned in SF; not sure I ever will, but I think there's a role here in the larger pattern of living.</div>

<div class="content">I leave those types of task listed on a separate sheet on the bench - otherwise I'm likely to forget to take the meal I prepared, or leave something else essential behind that can't go in the bag before last minute.  Personally, putting those into SF would not help, because I am not in the habit of looking at it as I rush out the door, and doubt that I would try to incorporate it.  SF is working brilliantly for me to guide my 'work at home' time productively, but due to the total non-fit in my 'work where they pay me' time, it can't bridge the join between the two.  Like Mark though, I will add 'prepare dinner', 'dishes' to the list if I'm likely to lose them in my focus on whatever has grabbed my attention from the list. (Or procrastinate on them till they bug me in the case of the dishes).  This is where I love column 2, and it's interesting to see how many times 'dishes' and 'next step in washing' appear in my C2 entries over the course of all those pages.</div>
