<div class="content">I am seriously considering a move back to AF1.<br><br>AF2 is breaking down for me:<br><br>1) Whilst initially AF2 enabled me to keep up better with urgent tasks, I find I am permitting myself to fall into the trap of just doing things as they show up (sometimes even without writing them down at the end of the list).<br><br>2) This tendency is also caused by the problem of having to look at everything from the end of the list before I choose an item to action.<br><br>3) This problem of tripping over freshly entered tasks at the end of the list seems to be causing me not to enter items of doubtful value since I know that if they are there I will have to trip over them time and time again as I work up the list to find items that stand out.<br><br>4) So my list is getting shorter and shorter (I am down to 16 active items) and am faced with the necessity of dismissing items after only two days on the list.<br><br>5) I simply cannot get used to working backwards through the list.  (This problem is intensified if I want to enter a block of say 5 items in a logical sequence and it is clearly impossible to work backwards through those items).  Working backwards is like sweeping a floor whilst staying ahead of the sweepings and pulling the sweepings after you.  I much prefer the feeling of AF1 where all the work is ahead of me and I am sweeping at it from behind.<br><br>So I am considering a return to AF1 but with two tweaks harvested from AF2.<br> TWEAK 1:  Dismissal is automatic after 7 days on the list.<br>TWEAK 2:  I am free to choose from anywhere on the list before 11am.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jim<br><br>I can really relate to your experience - having worked with my old AF1 list the effort of working back is a real pain but I figure that using my old list should give a more realistic work pattern than just starting afresh.  I am really finding AF2 better in the ability to choose from anywhere on the list and the enforced dismissal or action of earliest items is a lot less able to be bypassed than under AF1.  However the working backwards feels unnatural.<br><br>I am finding that I am working more on a page by page basis (working backwards but working each page top to bottom) and working that page more as a closed list until no items stand out before returning back to the end of the list.  I am definitely more productive with this method and the enjoyment of my lists has recovered - although I still loved AF1 I realise now that it had become less intuitive (my fault I'm sure but true nonetheless).  With AF2 I feel I have got back to the essence of the standing out process again, which makes my actioning of tasks flow so much more easily.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine<br><br>You have clearly encountered the same problems as I have and your solution is quite an elegant one.  I feel that I could make your method work quite well.<br><br>But your method seems to be more like AF1 than AF2 and since I normally work with only about 4 active pages, I feel more inclined to just go back to AF1 rather than to try your method since there would be little to choose between the two methods in my case.<br><br>Thanks for sharing.  I am comforted to know that you have encountered the same problems as I have.  I was beginning to wonder if I was just getting a bit slack in not sticking to the rules.<br><br>By the way, I think it is important not to blame ourselves if things do not seem to be working, after giving them a good go.  The problem may well be with us, but it may also be with the system.</div>

<div class="content">Jim,<br><br>although I share your experiences 1-5 completely, I am still not willing to give up and go back to AF1. <br>Perhaps the following setup would help:<br><br>Using the calendar for appointments only.<br>Using an one-page-per-day diary for work to be done on a certain day (maybe using time blocks, esp. scheduling  tasks for projects that have a deadline).<br>Using the AF2 list (paper notebook) for discretionary-time items only (maybe with dismissal every seventh day).<br><br>What do you say?</div>

<div class="content">Jim, Sorry to hear you're hitting a problem with AF2.<br><br>You wrote "I simply cannot get used to working backwards through the list. (This problem is intensified if I want to enter a block of say 5 items in a logical sequence and it is clearly impossible to work backwards through those items). "<br><br>Maybe the reason for the difficulty is that you're not distinguishing between WORKING backwards (i.e. actioning the last task, then the second-last, then the third-last, and so on) and READING backwards until one item stands out?   If you have a sequence of five items that need to be done in a particular order, you will have written them like this: <br><br> search teenager's room for dirty washing<br> load washing machine<br> tumble-dry clothes<br> iron clothes<br> hang clothes back in wardrobe<br><br>When you READ backwards as per the instructions, the first thing you come to is "hang clothes back in wardrobe", but I can't imagine a scenario where the combination of intuition and rational thought that characterises AF would make that item stand out before the four tasks above it.  It's very likely that the first item that would stand out would be "search teenager's room...".  If it doesn't, then your combination of intuition/rational thought is telling you that the laundry isn't 'ready to be done' yet, and that you should keep moving backwards through the list until some other item does stand out.  <br><br>Some other people's posts have implied that they think you have to WORK backwards from the last item on your list, but that's not the same as READING backwards and then working on the item that stands out.  <br><br>Anyway, hope this helps.</div>

<div class="content">Same for me. After an initial enthusiasm about AF2, I realize that it encourages me to move even further in the direction I was moving already while testdriving my REVERSE AF tweak - to be almost all the time at the end of the list, neglecting the tasks in the middle. Which is a fault and something my rules should have avoided.<br><br>Looking at the list as a whole does not work for me really, either. As I see AF1, its source of efficiency comes to a large part from eliminating procrastination, and it does so by using the "closed list effect". Having just one page to choose from is a whole different thing than having to choose from a list that is 5, 15 or 25 pages long.<br><br>So, right now I am fiddling with a tweak to my tweak. I want to work through my AF list page by page, as original AF suggested, while having enough an eye on urgent items in order not to forget anything and get in trouble. I have set some additional rules for myself; I'll see how they will work.<br><br>But that's just me, I'd like to add. For example, working backwards through the list always felt more natural to me than the other way round.</div>

<div class="content">Regarding items that you know you'll use for procrastination, I found that if I enter those into the list, I'll do them very frequently in the beginning, but I soon get 'aware' of what I'm doing and then consciously decide to not do them so often. So I would spent more time on them if they were not on the list, really.</div>

Most people would consider that a system which reduced their active items to only 16 would have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams - *especially* if one of the reasons is that items of doubtful value have been excluded.<br><br>So I'm just wondering why you would want to leave something which appears to have been a resounding success for you.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jim<br><br>Out of curiosity I looked back at my old list to see how many pages I had in AF1 after a week and found that I was half way through page 14.  Although my rate of task entry varies considerably, as a general rule I add less tasks than in the past (my record was 141 when I was dealing with a very specific backlog issue) and my no of outstanding tasks is slowly decreasing.  I'm not sure where that will ultimately level out but suspect that I will find the "right" balance more easily with AF2.<br><br>However, I have come to the conclusion that the best method for me to achieve that is with two tweaks (sorry Mark!!!)  (1) Working backwards but page by page, treating each page as a closed unit before returning to the end of the list. (2) Actioning or dismissing the "on notice" items at any point during the day.<br><br>The advantages of (1) are that it retains the closed list feel of AF1 and, if a task on the same page stands out I can action it smoothly without being forced to go and read through multiple pages.  I know if anything new has been added to the list since I started the page so if it is urgent it will pull me back naturally.  The advantage of (2) is that I will be free to action or not at the time the item/s stand out.  The fact that they are "on notice" gives me the incentive to make a decision on items that generally do need doing, are not urgent, but on which I have procrastinated.  That deals with the issue of limited discretionery time on some days, and, although the on notice items did pull me back it did not feel comfortable and made going back more of a chore than a natural "flow".<br><br>What concerns me about the workarounds that are being suggested are they seem to alter the intentions of AF which are (a) to identify and do the "right" tasks and (b) to allow the system to filter rather than us.  By using reminders, workarounds, filtering tasks etc, seems to remove that advantage and the situation of dismissal at too early a stage is also causing concern.  Perhaps there should be a rule that no items are dismissed for the first week after starting a new list, or that the dismissal rule only comes into effect if there are items over a certain age.  That would remove the dismissal of genuine items when they could legitimately be on the list as necessary tasks.<br><br>I think having a mature list to work on has enabled me to see the advantages and disadvantages of AF2 with a large list but I am definitely procrastinating less because I can just skip a page if nothing stands out.  I realise that I was deliberately leaving a few easy items on list to avoid acting on or dismissing tasks because I could always "just do one item" under AF1.  With AF2 there is no "advantage" so I am clearing a lot of those tasks but also finding that others that I had resisted are now "standing out" more easily, probably because I can move so much more quickly through the pages, yet address current stuff as necessary.<br><br>I do wish that I had not felt tweaks to be necessary but as it is they are working so well for me that I feel I have fallen in love with AF all over again! :-)</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br>Yes, I know he didn't write it like that. I interpreted it the way that he is not anymore adding things freely to list to let the system sift through them, but has to do filtering in advance, defeating the "autofocus" part of the system. So I didn't mean he doesn't trust the system with his important tasks, but he doesn't trust the system to aid him in the decision process anymore. Sorry if I'm still unclear, I'm not even sure I got it right, less how to express it correctly.</div>

<div class="content">Christine:<br><br>I did experiment a bit with something resembling your "tweak" during the development phase, but in the end I decided it just slowed the system down and made it less responsive. Maybe you'll do better!<br><br>Although AF2 can be used with an old AF1 list, I think it's preferable to start with a new list. The lists tend to mature in different ways with AF1 and AF2. I think you probably wouldn't have needed the tweak if you'd started a new list.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark<br><br>You may well be right but my list is an old friend!  I couldn't just throw it away :-)<br><br>There was something quite freeing about the structure of the closed lists (which I know sounds like a bit of an oxymoron) and using that structure but with the new dismissal rule somehow seems to reenable the standing out process.  I hadn't realised quite how far I had drifted from that into a "I must do something on this page regardless" mentality and yes, I know that was in itself not sticking to the rules but that was what had happened.  For me the mixture of AF1 pages and AF2 process really does seem to be giving me the best of both.</div>

<div class="content">Andreas:<br><br>I understand what you mean, but it still raises the question of why he thinks it is a problem. After all it doesn't really matter whether it's pre-screening or the system which has filtered out the doubtful items. They're both frameworks for him to make choices.<br><br>I also don't understand why he is forced to dismiss items after only two days on the list. If he has only sixteen items then he could do the lot in one day without difficulty (using little and often).<br><br>Actually I suspect the easiest answer for him would be to work from the beginning of the list forwards. It makes the system less responsive to urgent items. But that appears to be what he wants.</div>

<div class="content">ps And I can definitely see how the two lists would mature differently.  I can actually see that within my pre July and post July lists.  Mind you, at some point with the AF2 dismissal process my list will be all AF2 anyway - although that may not be for a while :-)</div>

<div class="content">Mark<br><br>Yes I feel quite comfortable with a small number of active items, but I feel that I have paid a price for this result.  I think that I have been inhibited about putting new items at the end of the list because I fear that it will overcrowd the end of the list where I am repeatedly "looking" for the next tasks ready for action.<br><br>I felt much more expansive with AF1 knowing that new items at the end of the list would have time to mature, to find their own level of importance without getting in the way during the next few days or so.  AF1 encouraged a greater creativity, a freedom to test out new directions without my being challenged to keep considering the new items time and time again as I constantly returned to the end of the list after every task. <br><br>Furthermore, as I suggested, with so few items, the dismissal rules are problematical as the oldest items are put on notice as early as a day or so after entry.<br><br>Frankly, I felt I was moving in the direction that someone on the forum mentioned a little time back.  Just have one item on the list: "Surf the web" and just keep re-entering it after each session.  Clearly a small number of active items is no virtue in itself.  We have to look at the price to be paid for such leanness.<br><br>Margaret<br><br>Thanks for emphasizing the fact that we do not "work" through the list backwards item by item.  I was, of course, aware of that.  It was really just that I found repeatedly looking at the newest items distracting.  (Though I did often relish the freedom to work on new items as they showed up when often their very newness and the clarity of what was required in them gave me the energy to deal with them quickly and effectively.)<br><br>By the way, with your example of the dirty clothes, you are quite correct that it would only be when you reached the start of the logical sequence of actions that the start of the sequence would stand out, but if you wanted to work each item straight one after the other the rules say you would have to go to the end of the list after each of the 5 items before you could return to the next item in the sequence.  (I tried various ways around this such as treating the sequence as a single item if I wished, but it did seem to complicate things.)</div>

<div class="content">Mark & Andreas<br><br>Clearly much of the above crossed with my post.<br><br>I think you are both right about what I said in my original post.  I do sense that I have been inhibited about adding items that might turn out in time to be quite valuable.  So probably there has been some unhelpful "censoring" at the point of entry.  I honestly can't specifically name anything that I regret leaving off the list, but I just have this uncomfortable feeling that my imagination is freezing up in the face of the threat of overloading a list which I am already having difficulties handling.<br><br>But more importantly, I agree, Mark, that since I have grown to favour pretty lean lists (In the last couple of weeks of AF1 I was averaging about 35 active items at the end of each day and I constantly had the experience of what you called "chasing the end of the list") I do not really need the opportunity that AF2 offers to deal more sensitively with urgent items.</div>

<div class="content">Jim: My example of doing the dirty washing wasn't a very good one, because i imagine that for that type of activity, where some steps would never be done in isolation, it might be best to enter "do laundry", and when the task stood out you would do 'as much as you wanted'.    As has been said before: some activities lend themselves to being put down as one item on the list and other activities are better broken into small steps, according to how you like to work.  Best of luck with your efforts.<br></div>

<div class="content">Margaret<br><br>Actually, when I spoke of a sequence of tasks, the best example I can give is this:<br><br>Mark suggested that AF2 could help to do away with separate lists outside of AF.  This gave me the idea of entering each night a basic structure for my next day:<br><br>8.40 Launch desk routine (empty tickler  etc)...<br>AM exercise<br>Lunch<br>Nap<br>PM exercise<br>5pm  See client<br>Wind up business jobs<br>Cooking<br>Dinner <br>TV?<br>Wind down for the night<br><br>Most of these things are not time specific and some are.  But doing this has helped me to stay anchored to the list and I have often been able to look back on the day and find that I was pretty much "on list" all day long since everything I need to do was there at least in the form of a heading.<br><br>I intend to continue with this practice even if I go back to AF1. <br><br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Having tried AF2 for a few days, I will almost certainly be reverting to classic AF1, without any tweaks. For me, the original Autofocus just worked so well most of the time, and the times it didn't work so well was because I was ill and unable to work the list properly.<br><br>My main problems with AF2 are:<br><br>1) I tend to get stuck at the end of the list -- since trying AF2, I haven't managed to go far enough back in a day to get to the "on-notice" items.<br><br>2) In AF1, if I had, say, a book to edit, I would put down "Edit book" and work on it until I was fed up, then re-enter it at the end of the list. With AF2, I find I am unnecessarily breaking up the task into "Edit book chapter 1", then just working on chapter 1, then stopping, then entering a new task "Edit book chapter 2" and either starting on it immediately or being reminded of it constantly when I read through the tasks. This makes the task seem more complicated, on my mind all the time, and thus bigger and more daunting than it really is (sorry for the waffle on this one).<br><br>3) I don't have that many urgent items, so working always at the end of the list is mostly unneccessary. In fact, working at the end of the list all the time seems to *add* urgency, which is very far from how I want to work. I tend to do genuinely urgent items straight away, regardless of where or whether it is on the list. With AF1, whenever I felt that there were a lot of urgent items at the end of the list, I would jump to it temporarily and work there until I was happy that everything was under control (a tweak, I suppose), and then return to the page where I left off. But I have found that using AF1 things rarely become urgent -- things just get done in a timely manner.<br><br>4) I really don't enjoy the morning ritual of reading through the whole list. I'm just not a ritual kind of person.<br><br>5) I hate reading backwards up the list.<br><br>My feeling is that AF2 is more suited to people with a lot of urgent, unexpected tasks, whereas AF1 is more suited to people with less urgent and unexpected tasks and more slow-burning or planned tasks or projects.<br><br>To put things in perspective, I run my own publishing business, publishing about 20 books a year. I also run 8 websites, and freelance for publishing clients (usually 3 or 4 a year). I am a cartographer and guide writer. I don't have employees, but regularly outsource work and liaise with partners. I have 3 children and a wife who works full-time. I work from home, and do a lot of the housework. I have 2 allotments and a large garden. I read for pleasure a lot, surf the internet, watch a lot of movies and tv drama, and enjoy days out with the family. Almost everything goes on my Autofocus list. For the last 6 months, since I started using Autofocus, I have been on top of my work, and have led a balanced life, and this is all due to adopting Autofocus. Autofocus hasn't just focused my day-to-day tasks, it has helped to focus my life. Instead of feeling overwhelmed, which I had for the previous 10 years, and wanting to pack everything in and give up, I now look around for more opportunities and challenges. Thank you, Mark. Autofocus arrived just in time to save me.<br><br>I tried so many other systems over the years, but nothing ever made me productive for more than a day at a time. They were all either too complex or inadequate. (I wasted more time with GTD than anything else -- I spent so much time tinkering with it that nothing got done. I can see it working in a corporate environment, maybe, but I wasted at least a year on it, and was very stressed and unproductive.)<br><br>Once I dragged myself away from the need to have the computer work everything out for me and break my day down for me without any intervention from me, I began to be productive. The revelation was that my todo list could be handled with one notebook and a pen (and a couple of checklists for complex projects that I have to repeat a few times a year, and a calendar for reminders and appointments).<br><br>Most importantly, I am using a simple system that works, that I can trust. I do not need to find "something better" -- I just have to avoid the temptation to look for something better.<br></div>

<div class="content">I think Mark may have devised 3 systems for 3 types of people and that's a very good thing. AF2 is perfect for me. The inability to do pleasant tasks that pop up during the day (e.g., check out X website) was too restrictive for me in DIT and AF1. I ended up doing these things outside the list and never felt like either of the former approaches was as effective for me as it should have been. I need the rewards of being able to do these kinds of fluffy things right away. Others find this to be foolishness or just too distracting. <br><br>Because I'm not perfectionistic about rules, if I finish doing laundry, I don't always mark it and read through my list from the newest items(fortunately, I can read my list from top to bottom as it's digital; I agree about reading backwards). Sometimes I finish the laundry and I have an overwhelming desire to complete the phone calls that are in the middle of my list. I simply do them, THEN return to my list, mark off those two tasks and re-read the list from the top to find the next task that stands out. I seriously doubt that Mark has a hidden camera checking to see that I re-read my list between every task. My take on this rule is that it is primarily to help you choose what to do when you don't know what to do. My take on this is the same for items up for dismissal. Wherever I am on the list, if I feel I want to address the tasks up for dismissal, I just DO THEM. To me, the point of AF2 is not to see how beautifully we follow AF2 rules, but to GET EVERYTHING THAT MATTERS DONE.<br><br>Before I found Mark's website, I would have an hour free to work and I would waste 20 minutes of it trying to decide what was most "important" to do. I'm still an imperfect person who probably spends an inordinate amount of time on this forum as a reward, but I am getting the important tasks done, I'm completely on top of my email (hallelujah!) and feel I have a more balanced, guilt-free life than I've ever had. Even if Mark chastises me for not rereading the list from the beginning after every single task, I honestly don't care. LOL I'm just thrilled with how well this approach meshes with my work style and personality and I won't be changing any time soon.</div>

<div class="content">I have worked AF2 diligently and tried to make it work. But I have had to switch back to AF1 for the reasons below and it feels wonderful to be back. For me AF1 is a natural fit and my productivity soars.<br><br>While the difficulties I have had with Af2 are tiny, they are like tiny bits of grit in my shoe - they chafe worse the faster you go. The speed with which I work the items in my lists is such that the tiny irritation quickly becomes a major problem. My list is rarely less than 14 pages and I close about 3 pages each day. And the reasons for my success with Af1 were hard to pin down, so my irritations with AF2 are sometimes hard to express - and they sound silly once expressed.<br><br>(1) One long list. <br><br>I love how AF1 lets me focus on just one page to the exclusion af all else. Its a closed list containing a mad mixture of easy, hard and challenging things. And it can be scanned easily without stress. Items jump out, get done and crossed off. Re-scan to see if any more items stand out - if not move on, happy to leave that page behind for a while.  <br><br>With Af1 its one long list. I started from scratch but have 12 pages today. And treating it as one long list is overwhelming me. Starting each day reading that long list just depresses me. It may be silly - but it defeats one of the great benefits I had from AF1.<br><br>Why is my list so long? Because one of the best things about Autofocus is that I throw everything and anything at it without having to think or worry or structure anything. My work and home life (and my internal creative processes) churn up tons of things - and the bigger my list the better it worked in AF1.<br><br>(2) Return to end after every task.<br><br>In AF1 I did have to place special symbols next to things as they became urgent as otherwise I might miss them. Those symbols were just an extra piece of information that might influence the 'standing out' process - and it seemed to work. When I finished a page for now, I moved on to the next (I go through the pages in reverse order).<br><br>In AF2 I am constantly having to go back to the end of the list. So I re-read the same few items I just added over and over again. Some of those items are resistance items - and each time I read them my stress level rises a micron or two. I tend to complete a handful of items each hour - that’s a lot of 'returning to the end' - and I have grown to HATE it. It’s a tiny irritation but it is repeated many times.<br><br>(3) Marking progress on the top of each page<br><br>In AF1 when I start on a page I write an open bracket on the top margin. When I start a task I add a slash. When I finish the item I turn the slash into an X. When I finish with the page for now I close the bracket. So the top of the page looks like this after a time<br><br>(XXXXX)(XX)(X)(XXX/<br><br>Its silly. But watching that progress motivates me a tiny bit. Wanting to convert that slash into an X motivates me a tiny bit. Wanting to close that bracket motivates me a tiny bit. So does crossing off items on the page. And this also helps me keep a 'cursor' on the active page (as well as my book marker).<br><br>With AF2 I have not been able to find a similar system. Nor is it needed as there are no 'pages' as such - just one big list.<br><br>(4) Dismissal<br><br>In AF1 I love the stalactite and stalagmite method of filling the page - work items from the top down, non-work items from the bottom upwards. I wont dismiss a page with only non-work items if I'm in the office and the reverse applies when I'm at home.<br><br>In AF2 the dismissal rules are different and they may indeed work better. I cant quite decide and given the 'one long list' metaphor a more global dismissal rule is needed. But when I treat each page as a closed list I am happy with the AF1 dismissal rules and it works for me.<br><br>(5) Overall progress<br><br>I manage to get through all my pages several times a day. Urgent things stand out and get done (or not if they are not important to me). I feel stress free and confident my system can handle whatever I throw at it. The more stuff the better. The faster it arrives the better. The same system serves me at work, at play, at home and on the road. This is the best system I have ever used and I don’t feel the need to find another.<br><br>None of the above is a criticism or a call to arms - each to his or her own - I just documented my observations - maybe they will help others - maybe not.<br><br>I am so happy with AF1. My productivity and creativity have improved beyond all expectations with it. I tried AF2 with gusto but it’s not for me. I had to switch because I cant afford to stick with it for a longer time to see if it works.<br><br>So I am back to racing through life stress free - one page at a time!<br><br>Paul<br><br></div>

<div class="content">ERRATUM:<br><br>In my previous post under (1) One long list; second paragraph...<br><br>"With Af1 its one long list." <br><br>should read<br><br>"With AF2 it's one long list."<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Interesting thread!  I loved AF1 and it was the first system that I have ever been able to stick with, much as I have benefitted from DIT and other systems in the past, and to be able to make real progress.  The problems I experienced were much the same as everyone else's, namely the issues surrounding urgent items, and I posted about my "tandem and unicycle" tweak which resolved most of my problems.  AF2 resolved those issues but created new ones - namely the drudgery factor of working back from the end each time and the reading up the list.  I too missed the closed page aspect of AF1.<br><br>AF1 worked but I needed to adapt it to something closer to AF2 - AF2 works better but I have needed to adapt it to something closer to AF1.  It feels to me as though the "ultimate system" lies somewhere in between.  By using AF2 dismissal rules, working backwards and returning to the end of the list each time but treating each page as a closed list and working it before returning to the end, and also allowing myself to action or dismiss "on notice" items at any time during the day has resolved all of the discomfort I felt with pure AF2 and I feel I am making even better progress now!<br><br></div>
