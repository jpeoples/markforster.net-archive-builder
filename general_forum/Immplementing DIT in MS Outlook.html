<div class="content">Hi Sri,<br><br>I am using Outlook 2007 and have the to-do bar setup as follows.  I have tasks set by start date -- you can right-click on the top bar and select "Arrange By" and then start date.  I then also select on right-click "Arrange By" and select "show in groups".  Now just enter tasks per DIT as tomorrow as the default.  If I need to add a new task for today, I add an asterisk at the beginning of the subject field so that it is clearly marked as a new task that must be done today, but was not on the closed list.<br><br>This works well in Outlook for the implementation of DIT.<br><br>Best regards,<br>-David</div>
