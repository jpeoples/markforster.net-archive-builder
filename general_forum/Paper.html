<div class="content">When I process an IN-tray, I deal with things that only take a couple of minutes immediately.<br><br>But what do I do with the larger items that cannot be dealt with immediately?  Clearly, some of them must be added to the end of the task list and dealt with in due time.  But then I have the problem of what to do with the *papers* that activated these tasks.  Some I could file in folders already existing.  Others I could create new folders for and file away somewhere where I can find them later.<br><br>My preference is to have a second tray on my desk beside the IN-tray.  Let's call it the PAPER-tray.  In this tray I place the papers remaining after the initial clearing of the IN-tray.  These I arrange periodically with the most urgent at the top and the least urgent at the bottom.  Then I simply add *Paper* to my task list and work through this tray when the task called *Paper* comes up for attention.<br><br>Some may claim that this undermines the system by inappropriate *batching*.  But I expect that most of us would deal with many of our emails in one single sweep.  I like to deal with most of my *paper* in one single sweep (or a series of successive sweeps if AF suggests it.)<br><br>I have some other ideas about what other things might appropriately be simply left in the *Paper* tray without listing each item separately on the task list.  But I would like to hear if others agree with this *paper* strategy.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jim<br><br>Paper is one of the biggest headaches I face.  You may want to consider a task of "review paper handling system" to see whether your existing system is working well enough for you.  There are a lot of systems around that work better with an intuitive system like AF than the accepted filing methods.  You may find the blog regarding the Noguchi system (just do a search for Noguchi on this blog) to be of interest.  There are other systems around as well.<br><br>My personal recommendation would be to do as Mark suggests and literally dump everything into the system, listing each task (piece of paper/action point etc) briefly without any grading or analysis.  The beauty of the system is that it does that automatically and I would be very surprised if you did not find that you completed a lot of tasks that would otherwise still be in one of your trays.<br><br>The danger of batching is that there is often a resistance to a batch of items because the mind either instinctively knows there is something unpleasant in there or has a fear response because it does not know what is in there.  The AF list eliminates that.</div>

<div class="content">Christine<br><br>You are absolutely right.  After reading your post, I realize that my Paper tray truly is a stumbling block for me.  In fact I now admit that my post was an effort to justify a practice that I could see no other alternative to.  <br><br>My analogy with a batch of emails was not a strong one.  Dealing with a batch of emails is not at all like dealing with a batch of papers.  <br><br>So I have turned my mind to devising a way of managing those troublesome pieces of paper, brochures, magazines etc that are waiting to be actioned so that they are not buried whilst they wait for the AF list to bring them to the fore.<br><br>I have a couple of new ideas on how to do this and will experiment with them for a week or two and maybe start this thread up again if I find a filing system that blends in well with AF.</div>

<div class="content">It took me a long long time to find a system to manage my paper.  I did find a system which covered a lot of what I needed but ultimately created my own which works well for long term filing and also managed my "pending" paper which sounds like what you have the most trouble with.  However I have to say that AF manages the pending papers (including brochures, reading material etc) far better than what I had previously. <br><br>You may be underestimating the time needed to add your papers onto the list.  With AF you do not have to assign urgency - the system will do that for you.  It will take probably no more than 5 minutes to enter 10 items.  If you repeat that 10 times during the day you can easily add 100 items in a given day, (around 3 pages on 34 lined paper).  NB It is probably a good idea to intersperse the entries with other tasks to avoid looking at a long list of similar items which can trigger resistance.<br><br>It really is possible to get paper under control!<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Jim and Christine:<br><br>The method I use for processing paper is to use a three-tier in-tray. All paper goes intitially in the top tray. When I get to the item "Paper" I move all the paper from the top tray one item at a time into the middle tray, taking action on those items that I feel like taking action on. This gets rid of most of the easy items.<br><br>I then repeat the process, moving each item one at a time into the bottom tray. This time I either have to deal with the item or put it on the main task list. This gets rid of the items of medium difficulty, and leaves the most difficult items in the bottom tray with a task referring to them.<br><br>I find this works very well. Oh, and I also have a rule that if I get interrupted in this process I always continue from where I got to, and don't allow myself back to the first tray until I have finished the whole process.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark<br><br>That's a great idea and one I will definitely try.  I can see how it acts as it's own mini AF system.  My current problem is that I had such a major paper backlog, which, although my old system had reduced them from well over 1,000 items down to a couple of hundred, those remaining "need" to be added into my AF lists for now to finally get rid of them one way or another.</div>
