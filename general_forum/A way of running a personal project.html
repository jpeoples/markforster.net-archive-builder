<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2013-08-28 0:19</div>
<div class="content">I've discovered over the past year this method that works very well for me.  And now that I think about it is commonly used by successful people in certain fields even though I don't see it talked about like I'm presenting here:<br><br>To operate a big personal project (as in I'm doing hard work), I work far more effectively if I journal it.<br><br>Take a notebook, write the project at the top of a page, and put a square.  It's a big todo item.  Next, think about how to achieve it, and write your thoughts. Once it's congealed to a definite step write the action and put a checkbox by it. If you know how to do that, go ahead, and make notes as you go. Then check the box, and refer back to the previous unchecked box. Consider your next step, and write out your thoughts. Continue in this manner, just writing thoughts and action steps, until everything is accomplished. that's it!<br><br>I find this writing radically improves my thinking and engagement versus just thinking and doing.  And When coming back after a short break I can read the latest notes to reengage my brain.  And when coming back after a long break, or after finishing a stage, I can review the unchecked todo boxes and get a context for my current work. Sometimes this review will unveil that the plan indicated by these boxes is no longer pertinent and I can even drop the current task in favor of a better newer plan.<br><br>So each project gets a book, and a master AF list just references these.</div>

<div class="content">Short version: writing my thoughts as I work a project, regardless of system details, improves both thinking and working. Maybe that's why those inventors and scientists had their journals.</div>

<div class="content">Alan:<br><br>Coincidentally I have been using journalling recently, though not in quite the way you are. However I think they are closely related in the way that they stimulate the mind to action. I'd be interested to know how you get on with this in the longer term.</div>

<div class="content">Alan's system is similar to what I do, but more formal. My thinking and meeting notes are filled with circles (faster than check boxes) and red herrings that I cross out. Pages that start as todo lists don't have the circles, but reference and thinking has a box around it, and gets crossed out when it's no longer important.<br><br>I start most work sessions with a list of tasks, and expand them as I start the task.<br><br>I'm mixed about a journal of what I did. Most days I don't need one. I take the time to update the weekly, monthly and milestone checklists. For non-routine tasks, the checkmarks and new notes on the page are enough. However, sometimes I don't have the appropriate page handy, and right now I can't remember when I last cleaned the fish tank.</div>

<div class="content">Mark: I've been writing stuff off and on for more than a year.  It's been really helpful.  This task noting thing I haven't really been formal about, but it's clearly helpful because when I'm trying to figure out what I need to do, I just read.<br><br>Cricket: A journal of what I did is useful occasionally if I need to go back and remember what was going on.  Writing what I need to do, and my working through what I need to do are more significant to me.  And after all that's written, a simple checkbox turns todo into what I donedid.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Alan, <br><br>Thank you for sharing your thoughts, this looks very interesting. <br><br>I recently read somewhere about the value of focussing on mainly one goal at a time over a period of around 90 days (although I suppose having a deadline is what matters) and I considered working on a main goal or project from the front of a spiral notebook, whilst having a 'grass catcher' type list for non goal / project tasks working from the back page. This would seperate items out neatly and practically whilst managing incoming tasks to do later. <br><br>Do you think this might work well?</div>

<div class="content">Leon: I'm inclined to think school style with one book or section per subject would be best. Then you might focus only on one subject for a period, but 90 days is possibly too long.  In addition, a grass catching section is essential, and that ought to be visited daily.</div>

<div class="content">I guess 90 days might work in some fields, but not in others.    In the mobile phone market, some companies are going from concept to product in 6 months.   Can't do that with a 90-day cadence on your focus project.   Need something more like Agile, with its two-week cadence.</div>

<div class="content">I find Alan's journaling idea very appealing.   I can't decide if I like it better than my latest modus operandi:  keeping a sheet or two of letter paper in my shirt pocket, scribbling notes and brainstorms and ideas and tasks on it, keeping it and referring to it for a few days, then throwing it away when I'm done with it.<br><br>Is the value in writing and thinking through?   Or in having the permanent record?   Or both?</div>

<div class="content">Dad used to do it all in one book. He always had the right book with him! He was a design engineer, so in theory the books were legal records in case of patent issues.<br><br>Most books I've read recently say 30 days or a month is best for a focus. Some say 6 weeks. That's long enough to get a good feel for that part, and encourages you to evaluate how it's going while there's plenty of time to correct. It's close enough to keep the pressure on, and give a reward without too much delay. The focus can be part of a much larger project.</div>

<div class="content">The primary value of Writing things is thinking things through. Secondary is having a record of recent thoughts to recover from distraction or confusion. Having a permanent record is very tertiary.<br><br>Cricket:  I bet your dad's book was organized by project.</div>

<div class="content">This is a good post, thanks for your thoughts. I'm quite excited about giving these ideas a good run over the next '30 days'! <br><br>I wondered if putting a check box to the right of an item gives it a different emphasis? Does it make the item more of a 'checklist' type item? Does putting a check box to the left of the item make it more of a 'to do' item? Or does it not really matter or make any difference...</div>

<div class="content">Alan, I've seen Dad's books. His work projects are all in one, with an index page. He labeled the pages clearly, so there was no confusion.<br><br>No matter what came up at a meeting or during lunch, he has the right book. He bragged about it when I was organizing my binders for class. He includes everything: meeting notes, a calendar page, notes made while reading, experiment outlines, data, back-of-the-envelope calculations -- everything he might want to look at again or need for a patent. Paper and shelf space are cheap.<br><br>Also, given the state of his desk, it would be a miracle if he could find anything not in the book!<br><br>He uses legal pads to draft letters or articles. Those get a lot of changes and the final result is typed up fairly soon, but the original outline and points to cover are often in the main book. Same with calculations he'll need a few stabs at, again, with enough notes in the book to survive a patent dispute. Yes, several versions of the same full-page schematic, with notes of what might need changing. Any calculations made away from his desk are in the book.<br><br>He has folders and binders for printouts and notes from other people, including agendas and minutes, that aren't small enough to be taped into the main book, or that he doesn't consider important enough to keep. Useful letters from people testing his prototypes often get glued into the books.<br><br>Before retiring, he had separate books for home and work, but his home book was organized the same, combining notes on the electrical properties of the new antenna, and sketches for the new deck. The actual measurements for the deck might be made on a legal pad, where he has lots of room to scribble and calculate and re-draw when he realizes that rock is two inches too high to allow the stairs to go where he wants, but unless he intends to buy the lumber and build it in the next week, the final notes are copied into the book, with enough detail that he can redo the calculations if something changes.<br><br>He also has a separate book for the local cottage association, but meetings and the design for the mailbox shelter are all in the same book.</div>

<div class="content">Leon, check out Zen to Done. You can get it for a reasonable price from the zenhabits website (or even free with a bit of looking). Also check out Agile Results. Both of them discuss breaking projects down into monthly and then weekly and then daily bits.<br><br>I just discovered www.productiveflourishing.com . (Thanks, Melanie. It's not like I needed more productivity porn.)<br><br>The free planners look useful for dividing things up. He also defines <br>    Objectives relate to months.<br>    Projects relate to weeks.<br>    Tasks relate to days<br><br>I'm working on a revised form of my milestone chart, which has more long-term planning. Stay tuned.<br><br>I sometimes put circles (faster than checkboxes) on the left for things I need to do at home, and on the right for things I want to address before the meeting's over. Or a different shape. Some meetings, I need another category for things to discuss with individuals before we split up, or first thing the next morning. Most of my meetings cause the chair to pull out his/her hair. Storytellers and crafters never stick to topic.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the tips Cricket, I've made some very good progress on this first day on an important project so I'm feeling hopeful that I can push forward and get some results. <br><br>I'm basically using Alan's method with a 30 day deadline (it need not be a hard deadline, it can be akin to a sprint or iteration as in Agile methods). This starts from the front of a notebook (large moleskine at the moment). I have a 'reminders' section starting from the back of the notebook, this is a grass catcher type list just of those things I'm likely to forget or need for reference and do not relate to the 30 day project. Lastly I have a basic calender for daily appointments.</div>

<div class="content">If I understood you right, Cricket, all subjects got intermixed, and your dad would just write whatever came next on the next page. and used page numbers to keep track of where things are at.<br><br>Two questions about your dad's book:<br>1) What didn't go in the book?  I mean you describe it as though it got everything, and yet there was a messy desk full of stuff that presumably didn't fit.<br>2) How big was it (LxWxP)?<br>3) and how long did take to fill?</div>

<div class="content">Leon, what's the deadline about?  My method is nothing to do with rigourous planning.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Alan,<br><br>I don't know if he numbers the pages. He dates the first page of each day, maybe every other page? He trusts the book binding.<br><br>Only things about his projects go in the books. Magazines and technical books obviously don't go in. Printouts of tax guidelines go loose on the desk, but he's careful with receipts. Emails he printed to read a second time or agendas, handouts and minutes, that he doesn't need for future reference, like comments on a draft. Prototypes. Samples. Catalogs. Drafts or calculations that he expects to work on in the next few days -- but he's equally likely to be creative in the book. His desk is very small, so it doesn't take much to look cluttered.<br><br>These days he uses 8-1/2x11 spiral bound, 80 to 100 pages. Thin enough they're comfortable to write on. I think he used hard-cover some years, when there wasn't always a desk handy. (He worked for several companies over his career.)<br><br>Still, given the state of his desk, the book is probably the most organized thing on it. If it's there, he can find it.<br><br>I don't know how long they take to fill, or how long he keeps them. He has a few on the shelf. I think he said something about the work ones belonging to work (another reason for having separate books for home and work), but my memory's fuzzy. For most knowledge workers, anything you do that's work-related, even if it's on your own time in your own basement, belongs to your employer.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Alan, <br><br>< Leon, what's the deadline about? My method is nothing to do with rigourous planning. ><br><br>It's simply my own way of allocating an amount of time to one endeavour so other projects don't crowd in. (I'm constantly thinking of starting new projects and then hardly getting anywhere with them). <br><br>It's a way of dealing with one big project at a time, that's all. There's no rigourous planning, it's just a date 1 month ahead. It creates some focus for me and provides a sense of a boundary if you like. <br><br>Hope that makes sense and that I've not used too much artistic license with your excellent method.</div>
