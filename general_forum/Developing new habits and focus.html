<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">Zenhabits.com promotes the idea "less is more".  One thing Leo, the Zenhabits blogger, stresses is for one to choose a goal and then focus on that goal for a month.  After the goals becomes a habit or is accomplished then pick another. (Sort of like Current Initiative ideas)  <br><br>He states, "Focus on one goal. Just as focusing on one task at a time is more effective, and focusing on one habit at a time is more effect, so is focusing on one goal at a time. While it might seem very difficult, focusing on one goal at a time is the most powerful way of achieving your goals. When you try to take on many goals at once, you’re spreading thin your focus and energy — the two critical components for achieving a goal.<br>What if you have 5 goals you want to achieve? Pick one to focus on first. Break it into a mini-goal you can accomplish this month, if it’s a longer-term goal. Pick an action you can do today. Keep doing this until the goal is accomplished — do an action every day, finish the mini-goal, pick the next mini-goal to work on. Then, when your One Goal is completed, focus on the next goal.<br>Some goals are ongoing ones — like blogging every day, or exercising every day. In those cases, turn them into habits — focus exclusively on turning the goal into a habit, until the habit is ingrained. Then focus on the next goal."<br><br>This fits with DIT Current Iniatives.  However, I am wondering how this would align with AF emphasis on little and often.</div>

<div class="content">Jonathan:<br><br>Autofocus encourages a "bottom-up" approach to goals. Instead of determining what your goal(s) should be, you allow them to emerge and develop as you work on them.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark<br><br>I'd forgotten that aspect of AF - I'm sure you mentioned this before somewhere.  Quite an eye opener in that that is exactly what is happening - AF is prompting me to change the way I both look at and do things, which in turn is having a knock on effect to how I am defing my projects and goals, and it makes sense that ultimately those goals will change ..... for the simple reason that not everything I thought was important is important.<br><br>Amazing!<br><br>It's funny but although I think DIT is a fantastic tool, and it is obvious that some people thrive on that method of structure, I could never understand exactly why it didn't work for me as well as I thought it should. I just thought it was because I was rubbish at following any system.  AF has shown that not to be the case but has provided the focus to really see what is going on.  Again, amazing!</div>
