<div class="content">My list has begun. I start following the rules tomorrow. <br><br>I'm always curious how people integrate Mark's rules/systems into their life. In this case, would you start with your AF list first thing in the AM. Do you earmark certain times of the day for AF? Looking forward to some of your responses.</div>

<div class="content">As I've said before, I tend to use a system from the time I get up in the morning to the time I go to bed. The only times I'm not using it are when I'm on a scheduled activity.<br><br>I'll be interested to see other people's responses to Avrum's question.</div>

<div class="content">One other point: I don't prepare a list before starting. I usually start by writing a short list (10-20 items) of easy tasks, get working right away, and then add other tasks as I think of them or as they come up in the course of working the list.<br><br>I've found this has worked very well with this particular system.<br><br>And talking of "this particular system", I suppose I should give it an official name. It is hereby named the "Jefferson Nickel" system according to my policy of naming new systems from now on after the Wikipedia article of the day.</div>

<div class="content">While I'm on I might as well mention that I've noticed that Jefferson Nickel behaves a bit differently from AF1. It seems to result in a more tightly compressed list.<br><br>I'm not quite sure why that is, but the following factors may have something to do with it:<br><br>1) It's much easier to start a difficult task (or any task for that matter) by doing just a small amount of work on it, safe in the knowledge that it really is going to get finished further down the line.<br><br>2) When there's a dotted task approaching which you don't particularly fancy doing, there's a tendency to do all the intervening tasks in order to put off the evil day.<br><br>Anyway I'm still finding things out about this system - which seems to be working very well indeed.</div>

<div class="content">"I'm always curious how people integrate Mark's rules/systems into their life. In this case, would you start with your AF list first thing in the AM?"<br><br>I generally follow the David Allen workflow method of Collect, Process, Organize, Review, Do. So when I get to the office, the first thing I do is Collect all my paper and electronic notes into one place. Then I Process those notes and my email inbox into Outlook. Then I organize them by determining if they are a next action (which means they go on the list) or somewhere else. Now it's Review time, checking my calendar for meetings and deliverable dates and perhaps reviewing my project list. Take a deep breath, and then Do, which means following an AF system, for me these days it is UTMS mixed with AF2 for the New list.<br><br>I usually get through the steps prior to do in 30-60 minutes (depending on number of emails). On days where I have lots of meetings, I start over at Collect each time I return.</div>

<div class="content">My day started like this:<br><br>Wife puts 9 month old on my head, while my 3 year old is crawling up my legs. Lists? HA! For the next two hours I stumble through the morning making breakfast, wiping snot and dropping off my toddler (late, as usual) for pre-school. <br><br>Instead of bookmarking time for using "Jefferson Nickel" i.e. between 10am - 5pm, I'm going to time myself whenever I'm engaged with the system. I'm curious to see how long I can sustain, day to day, working from a list with rules. I'll report the results after gathering one week of data.</div>

<div class="content">Tracking...<br><br>My idea of timing how long I'm in "Jefferson Nickel" mode was a dismal failure. In the past, I think Mark would count how many items were added each day. What method would you use to gauge how well you're doing with a list-based system like "Jefferson Nickel" or AF 1, etc?</div>
<h2>Reply by Mark Forster</h2>
<div class="meta">2013-11-18 0:27</div>
<div class="content">avrum:<br><br>The method I often use is how many days' work is in the system, i.e. how many days would it take to work on every task on your list if no new stuff were added?<br><br>This can be calculated by dividing the total number of actioned tasks on your list by the number of days your list has been going. This gives you the average number of tasks worked on each day. You then divide the total number of unactioned tasks on your list by this number.<br><br>So for instance my current list has been going for 5 days. I have taken action on 273 tasks. Therefore my daily average is 54.6 tasks. I have 68 tasks unactioned. Therefore there is 1.25 days' worth of tasks in the system.<br><br>The significant thing is the trend in this figure, which will show you how well you are keeping up with your work.</div>

<div class="content">would you start with your AF list first thing in the AM.<br><br>Depends on my mood. But as vegheadjones I follow during my day GTD rules. The job is so hard that I can't get rid of it. <br><br>At night I have clean my inboxes and updated my lists. <br>I start the day in my kitchen just reading my emails to see if there is not an emergency<br>(it happens sometime) <br><br>I wake up and take 5 mn of meditation first. The house is quiet it is the only time for me ;-)<br>then after my breakfast (tea and bred and English marmelade) <br><br>I sit on my desk and do quick jot of all I think on a blank paper page. <br>Then I read my 6 lists to see if I did not forget anything. Did I ? <br>I let my spirit put on paper my first purposes of the day freely. <br>I then prioritize the list A, B, C, time expected, the N°1, 2, 3 and do the first project first. It is the most important of my day. The one that if I had to stay at night I would stay for it. <br>then Later I will read my emails when it will be possible. <br>Then I report on my diary what I did or on my paper notebook. sometime both. <br>Then I do the most of I can little by little but most important things first and at a batch together project by projects.</div>

<div class="content">Mark: <br><br>Scenario: I come across two dotted tasks, one after the other, which are on the last page. I work on the first task and reenter it (on the same i.e. last page) with a dot. I do the same with the next task, and reenter it with a dot. Now, what if only one or two tasks separate the newly entered dotted tasks. And what if I don't take any action on those one or two tasks, do I immediately start working on the two dotted tasks I just did work on? What if only a min or two passed? Curious to hear your thoughts.</div>

<div class="content">avrum:<br><br>The rule is that you must always take some action on a dotted task when you come to it, unless that would entail doing the same task twice in succession.<br><br>In the scenario you paint, you would simply alternate the two tasks until you had finished one of them.</div>

Scanning the entire page w/o taking action causes more anxiety than clarity and/or getting a feel for the page. I'm going to bypass that rule today and see what happens<br><br>b.

<div class="content">Hi Mark, you said to Avrum:<br><br><In the scenario you paint, you would simply alternate the two tasks until you had finished one of them. ><br><br>Forgive me if I'm being a bit dim. But does this mean this method is extremely focussed on finishing tasks? Not that that's a bad thing. Does it mean that, as you cycle thru the pages, once you reach the the last page, you can only leave it when there's a single unfinished, ie dotted, task left?</div>

There may be no dotted tasks left, in which case you would leave the page as soon as no tasks stood out. Or you may have done another undotted task since you last did the single dotted task, in which case you wouldn't yet leave the page.<br><br>If you follow the rules as given at <a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2227611#post2236944" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2227611#post2236944</a> exactly, you will see how the rule works out and why it is necessary.</div>

<div class="content">One thing I don't think I've seen addressed yet about the Jefferson Nickel system is how it handles out-of-context tasks.  For example, some of my tasks can only be done during business hours, or only when on campus, or whatever.  My favorite Forster systems have always been the ones that handle this well.  For example, the Final Version always gives you an in-context list.  DIT allows you to choose when and where you do the tasks on a given day.  However, it seems to me that the Jefferson Nickel system requires you to break the rules when you reach a dotted task that is out of context.  Mark, is there a simple way to resolve this?</div>

<div class="content">"My recommendation has always been that you have a separate list for each location that you work in. I think it may even say that in the AF1 rules."<br><br>It's a little more complicated than that for me.  Much of my work as a student can be done in either place.  I can work on homework at home or on campus, and I can, say, search for apartments (a personal task, of course) while on campus if I want to.  Only a small cross section of my work is context limited, but it is enough to make a difference.  Having two or more lists, with many tasks applying to both lists, is very tedious to me.  One of the things that had me drooling over the FV when you released it -- and part of the reason it is still probably my favorite system today -- is that I can keep one master list, and my preselected list is always in context.  Now, maybe this is a personal problem that is unique to a student, but I have a feeling some of these things apply to others here as well.</div>

<div class="content">The context-thing was what always bothered me about GTD. It's impossible to create a set of contexts that are mutually exclusively and still workable.<br><br>As for the Home / Office / Coffee Shop division: what about stuff that I can do at either location? Create a 4th list "Anywere"? Having more than 2 lists requires to think carefully about what list to put it in before you write something down, apart from thinking about how to phrase it, how to define it precisely enough to know when it's "finished" etc. You could argue to have a context @Computer, but what about laptop/desktop/computer-at-work-that-has-different-software-installed? Aaargh!<br><br>At some point I got so fed up with thinking about overlapping/nested/mutually exclusive contexts that I ditched the whole context-idea and stuck with one list. One disadvantage is that I can get distracted by home-stuff when at work, but in practice that's not too bad. Usually my home tasks are moving much slower than my work tasks, so I end up with a list that has mostly home-related tasks at the beginning, and mostly work-related tasks at the end. But a major disadvantage is that it messes up the flow of the AF1-algorithm on pages where you have only one or two items left that can only be done in a specific context, which I guess is similar to what Austin is talking about.</div>

<div class="content">Austin and Nicole:<br><br>I don't have an answer to your questions. I can't cover every situation faced by every user, so essentially it's up to the individual to find the way that suits them best. And if they can't find a suitable way, then they should try another system.<br><br>Having said that, you may be able to do stuff in either place, but I presume that most of it you don't *have* to do in both places. So the solution might be to restrict most tasks to one or other place, regardless of the fact that you could do them in either.<br><br>That is certainly the case with the coffee-shop list. If I work in a coffee-shop then there are probably only about three tasks which I am likely to do there, e.g. email, writing my next brilliant novel and checking Facebook. So quite a short list.</div>

<div class="meta">2013-11-20 22:27</div>
<div class="content">Thanks, Mark.  I know from experience that I am happier with one list.  For the most part this does not cause problems, but it seems like it has that potential in the Jefferson Nickel system.  Maybe I will just create a rule that allows me to ignore dotted tasks that truly cannot be done now.  It may be as simple as that.</div>

<div class="meta">2013-11-21 8:57</div>
<div class="content">On the context issues - I've often run from just one list. If a task can't be done because it's out of context then it doesn't stand out for me when I scan the page. It means I have to pay attention on dismissal because I may scan a page and have nothing stand out, but there may be out of context tasks on there. So I wouldn't dismiss a page unless all the tasks COULD have been done but didn't stand out.<br>The main thing that has me split lists is the convenience of the physical notebook. For example I have run work and personal life from one pocket notebook in the past but currently have a separate larger notebook for my job, because I want the extra page size when taking notes. When I work in different locations it's just a matter of having my work notebook with me, which isn't an issue as I also need various files and my laptop, so the notebook is a small part of the logistics. <br>I freely add personal tasks to my work notebook and vice-versa if it seems appropriate at the time, I don't fret about it too much. If I am really stuck, let's say without a notebook or really wanting to note something for home while I am at work I just email myself and then pick it up later.<br>If I am really worried I will miss a time-critical task then I add a reminder to my calendar.<br>It's not perfect but it's largely worry-free.</div>
<h2>Reply by Nicole</h2>
<div class="meta">2013-11-21 10:04</div>
<div class="content">Thanks for the reply, Mark.<br><br>Yes, whenever I feel the urge to go back to split lists your suggestion of restricting most items to one list, even if they can be done at multiple places, is what I try to do. But most of the time, my one single list works reasonably well. It's just that every now and then the disadvantages I mentioned bother me a bit more than usual, so then I experiment with a Home list and an Office list. In the end I always come back to a single list, because with split lists I always have the feeling there might be something in the other list that I'm missing.<br><br>I like the idea of a small and a larger notebook that Matt mentioned to maintain split lists. I do that during holidays, so I might try that sometime for regular work periods also.</div>

<div class="content">Regarding Contexts.  Consider keeping three seperate lists:  Home, Work, and Coffee Shop.  On each list, have a reoccuring task to make one pass through one of the other lists.  EG:  On the Home List, have "One pass through Coffee Shop List" and "One pass through Work List".  Do the same for the other two lists.  Therefore, if you're sitting in the Coffee Shop, you could make one pass through the Home List and action whatever needs to be done from there that you can handle in the Coffee Shop.  Of course, you'd only do this if you feel you're caught up enough on Coffee Shop stuff, or there's something drawng you to the Home List.<br><br>I did this with standard FV, and it worked well for me.  I don't know how it would work with this JN system - but that's my best answer...</div>
