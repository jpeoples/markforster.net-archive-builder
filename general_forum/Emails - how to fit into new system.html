<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br>I am keen to give this a try, but what is stopping me at the moment is working out how to fit incoming emails into the system. I receive many many emails every day, and one thing I liked about DIT was the fact that you could put them all in a folder for "tomorrow" and then action them all in one go the next day. With the new system, I don't want to have to enter each email onto the bottom of the list as I would practically spend my whole time doing this! Would you recommend combining the two approaches, and setting a time to go through (and action) emails each day and then add any relevant and longer term tasks to the bottom of the list?</div>

<div class="content">Adele,<br><br>Would not the task be "Yesterday's Emails"?  As I understand it, if you did not finish clearing all of them, you'd write it down again ie not each individual mail, but the folder which contains yesterday's emails.<br><br>Maybe it's the novelty thing, but I seemed to have got more taks done today despite 3 hours out of my office to see my accountant.<br><br>I guess if you write down something that you can't do today, you use a reminder to drag it back into your conscious, eg via a Tickler file, Outlook task reminder, whatever suits you.<br><br>Am I right, Mark?</div>

<div class="content">Adele:<br><br>No, I just put "Clear Email" as a task in the list. I usually find that I clear emails several times a day. Only if an email needs a detailed reply or further consideration or action would I make it a separate task.</div>

<div class="content">Roger J:<br><br>"Yesterday's emails" would be a hang-over from DIT. But as in DIT you should aim to clear *all* your emails every time you deal with them.<br><br>You can safely write down tasks that you can't do today if you will be able to do them in a couple of days. This is because in Autofocus it usually takes a few days to finish a page. If it's going to take longer before you can do them, then use a tickler or Outlook as you suggest.</div>

<div class="content">I had a YESTERDAY folder from DIT plus a BACKLOG folder from a declared email backlog so set up three separate tasks, clear email, clear YESTERDAY folder and clear BACKLOG folder.  All tasks can be actioned and relisted if appropriate - and if I am away for a period and end up with another backlog the system will easily accomodate them.  By using separate Outlook folders (set to show all items) I can see at a glance how many I have still to clear.</div>
