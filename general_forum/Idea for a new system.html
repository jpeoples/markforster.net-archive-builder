<div class="content">I have been struggling with AF.  The issue is one of overwhelm, feeling like I'm drowning in tasks.  I had exactly the same problem with GTD.  I left my job six months ago to take a six month break.  The break has now ended and I'm starting my own business so I've got a lot to do.  <br><br>Yesterday I took my notebook and put the date at the top of the page and jotted down a couple of things to do, put a dot next to the one I decided to do and did it for as long as I wanted.  Then I crossed it out and readded if it wasn't done.  I added things as I thought of them.<br><br>Today I started afresh with a new page.  I haven't decided what to do with the undone's from yesterday and the other lists of "things to do" including the old AF list.  OK not a system but its got me started and feeling better.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">SUPER!<br><br>I think it IS a system.  It is YOUR system.  Why not try what we have advised here so often.<br><br>- Just add to the list, don't start a new one each day,<br><br>- Don't do anything with items from your old lists, wherever they are from.  Perhaps scan them to see if there is something you should be paying attention to ... if you find such things, add them to your list in your book.  If not, just trust that they will come up again on their own ... they will.</div>

<div class="content">I think just dumping anything out of your head will make you feel better.<br><br>You could try taking it to the extreme - and feel way better - using something like John Reese's Reboot Your Brain approach.<br><br><a href="http://www.marketingsecrets.com/images/rebootmethod/rebootmethod.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.marketingsecrets.com/images/rebootmethod/rebootmethod.html</a><br><br>(It's a long, free video - might take a while to load)</div>

<div class="content">I have encountered the same situation. And worked like this for years. <br>Putting things of your head just make you feel much better. If you do it at night you will sleep much better !!! just try !!!<br>If you does it is because your brain or inconcious part thinks it is important.<br>So when you do the double reading you inconcious chosse standing task what you have to do or not. The problem i found is when there are to many tasks thre is a limit point <br>Starting a new AF list make you focus on the most important priorities of the day and if you dont do the things the day before it is just because you dont have to do it....<br></div>
