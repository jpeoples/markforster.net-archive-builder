<div class="content">At lunch today, two of my friends were discussing their use of GTD.  Primarily, they discussed the GTD practice to have a Single System for both Work and Home life.  The combo provides them the ability to understand their day/week/month in totality.<br><br>And that's when it hit me -- why GTD (any many other systems) doesn't work for me.  All that visibility and plan and stability and totality.  Yech! I'm starting to twitch just writing this.  I love variety, and spontaneity, and adventure.  I like not knowing what's ahead.<br><br>I realize this viewpoint is quite different from many, but I think it highlights why I love AutoFocus.  I make one list.  Then I work it work it, work it.  Sometimes it brings me this, sometimes that.  And anything that Absolutely Needs To Get Done is on my calendar or my daily Most Important Tasks list.<br><br>---paul<br>11 pages, 1 page dismissed</div>
