<div class="content"><br>As you know, *Procrastination* is relative and very subjective thing.<br>Since how you do know when you're procrastinating?<br><br>Example.<br>If you feel that should write report, but you're reading emails;<br>Question is: do you procrastinate?<br>Trivial answer: yes, you're procrastinating.<br>Alternative answer:: no, i'm not procrastinating - i need to read these emails too<br><br>So, in a way, procrastination is created within our minds. And you can get things done<br>still while you're procrastinating. You could have todo list of 5 tasks. And you<br>'ve done 4 of those, however, you feel lousy and think you're ineffective since you haven't done task 5. On the other hand, you're effective and you have not procrastinated since you have already done 4 items...<br><br>So, procrastination is subjective and could be defined as "not doing something what you think you SHOULD be doing".<br><br>And now comes tricky part...<br>When you're "collecting stuff" and writing large to-do-lists => you feel always that you're procastinating (at least something) because there is always some tasks that you haven't done.<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Vp:<br><br><< you feel always that you're procastinating (at least something) because there is always some tasks that you haven't done. >><br><br>You've put your finger very neatly on the major problem with time management which I have been attempting to address with my alternative systems:<br><br>With "Get Everything Done", the  idea is to move forward systematically on everything that it currently active. That way you may not yet have finished everything, but at least you know that you are moving forward with everything.<br><br>With "Do It Tomorrow", the idea is that you keep your commitments audited so that your work is in balance with the time available to complete it.<br><br>With "Autofocus", the idea is to give a framework for your intuition to work with your rational mind to select what should be done.<br><br>With my new super top secret system, the idea is that everything gets done as soon as it needs to be so you never have any sense of procrastination.</div>

<div class="content">Hi, Vp<br><br>You have a valid point here.  I know a lot of people who keep no lists and appear to lead a reasonably carefree life.  Despite what GTD says, there is usually not a lot of evidence that incomplete commitments are playing on their minds and exhausting them.<br><br>However, I am not like that.  I rely on being able to identify clearly what commitments I have made to myself and to others and to be active and energetic in attending to those commitments.  Hence I am very drawn to using AF to highlight the many ways I can live life more fully and constructively.  One downside of this is that I always seem to have a lot on my plate and it is not always easy to settle for what is reasonably possible in a day.  Hence, I find that a degree of regret at not getting around to some of the things on my list is a side effect of being conscientious at recording so completely the many things I feel inclined to undertake.<br><br>However, the discomforts that the AF approach cause for me in this regard are not grave enough to cause me to wish that I were more casual in my approach to the multitude of "tasks" that truly enhance my life in the end.  <br><br>Actually, as I understand it, Mark too acknowledges there is a certain truth in what you say about the difficulty of avoiding procrastination but the theory of "structured procrastination" is an attempt to make the tasks for which there is high resistance cause you to see the less threatening tasks as easier by comparison. <br><br></div>

<div class="content">Or you could give up on the idea that you are procrastinating. There are things to do and you will do some of them. How you choose to do them and how many is not a moral, intellectual, spiritual, or personality failing.<br><br>Guilt and shame rarely are good long-term motivators. AF is a good tool for me. As I have said, it has allowed me to become more realistic about how I want to spend my time and more importantly: energy. Deciding ahead of time how to spend my time and energy rarely worked for me over the long term.<br><br>With AF, things show up and some get done with my help. Much of the energy I used to use to plan how to overcome my "resistance", prioritize, look for the better mouse trap, etc. goes into helping get things done.<br><br>FWIW.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>I like what you said; one should get done everything.<br><br>Yes, i know that this thinking goes *against* traditional time management, since nearly all the systems always make assumptions like: you can't do everything, you need to prioritize etc.<br>However, the problem is, that if you take attitude "i need to prioritize or i can't do everything" => then one is possibly feeling procrastination because one is not doing some of the to-do  items (because of prioritization).<br><br>Basicly, i'd recommend this type of system:<br><br>1.) write down all things you need to get done (this is common sense and like in GTD)<br>2.) do rough estimation how long each item potentiaaly requires time to be done<br>3.) sum up all time needed to get whole list done<br><br>Now comes interesting part: even if you have tons of tasks and complex projects,<br>usually the cumulative time needed is not in fact very big<br><br>Example; you have 100 five minute tasks => 100 x 5 = 500 => less than 9 hours!<br>These 5 minute tasks are straight forward actions like; reply email, call x, search web, write, draft picture, buy, read, fix etc.<br><br>So, your task list could (at least theoretically) be completed in *one* workday or  so.<br>Next,<br><br>4.) now you have cumulative "time cost" of your to-do list<br>5.) If don't have possibility to complete all in one or two days, you can block three "3 hour timeboxes" spread over next three days<br>6.) when you have complete task, mark how much time it took in reality (this way you get better in estimating "time cost" of tasklist.<br>7.) do tasks :-)<br><br>Vp<br><br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Procrastinating means that you are holding of the tasks that you have to do. I do not think this is the problem with most people that look for a system, like GTD or ZTD or AF. I think that most people seek for a system that helps them do the right task at the right time. And also seek a system that helps them not to forget the important stuff in the middle of all the stuff that clouds your horizon.<br><br>Me, as a manager, need to remember the things that I promise to my people. For example, if they adress a problem and I promise to take care of it it is very important not to forget. They expect me to solve the problem and provide feedback to them. Without them reminding me all the time. The AF gives me the system that lets me write everything down and by how it works it will tell me wich task is important when. Providing that you look regularly in your list. I will never forget anything and will always be reminded that I have an open task towards one of my people.<br><br>Prioritizing has the disadvantage that by doing so you actually are already deciding when you will doe this task relativaly to other tasks with other priorities on your list. By giving it a priority you lock down the task. Using AF you never lock down the task but you keep an open mind towards it. You let your build in logical mind give you the headsup on which task needs to be done at which time.<br><br>I hope I have made my point here. English is not my native language so I did my best on explaining what I think is important with AF en what is the problem with systems that use priorities.<br><br>Oh, and Mark, that new super top secret system, when will you reveal it to us? I am very curious because AF is already so simple and straight forward in its design that I do not grasp what you could actually improve on it!<br><br>Grtz<br>Han</div>

<div class="content">All Time Management and Planning is a form of procrastination wince it reduces the time spent doing things.  However, some projects and goals require planning to be be done in a time efficient manner.  The problem is in finding the right balance.  Why write down call Bob if you are going to do it now.  Yet, writing a grocery list that causes you to get everything you need in one trip saves time.  I think with some systems they are actually counterproductive because they take so much overhead.  This is why I always gravitate toward simplicity.  When I see lots of features, gizmos and things to maintain it is a turn off.  But then again my personal approach is very Taoist, as I look to strip away not add.<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">There seems to be a fundamental assumption here that procrastination is always a bad thing. Is that really true? One of the defintions of "procrastinate" is simply to "postpone action".<br><br>Sometimes I find that putting off even apparently crucial tasks can in the longer term be positive, and they may not even need to be done by the time I get round to them. Insurmountable problems sometimes solve themselves if left to themselves.<br><br>The trick I guess is to know when this is the case....</div>

<div class="content">Jaroslav<br><br>I think this is where AF comes into it's own.  I think our intuition does actually have a pretty good understanding of what tasks (crucial ones included) should be put off but we usually run with our rational thought processes.  I have learned a lot by allowing myself to ignore the shouts of those apparently crucial items and go with my intuition.  Usually an alternative approach has become evident, maybe at the last minute, but always in time.</div>

<div class="content">Christine,<br><br>I appreciate that this is the idea behind AF, but for me it often doesn't work in AF. The tasks that "stand out" as I scan a page are usually precisely the ones that either are making me most anxious, or are responding to the most emphatic demands of people I work with. I can learn to ignore these, but not if I follow the AF instructions. Funilly enough, I found it easier to ignore such "shouts" within DIT than in AF.</div>

<div class="content">Jaroslav,<br><br>Good points on the literal definition of "procrastination". Unfortunately, the word got mixed up with Puritanism and associated with its world-view regarding industry and sloth.<br><br>Other cultures throughout time and today do not make such a big deal about "productivity" and getting things done as a measure of personal value.<br><br>I would elaborate more . . .  hasta mañana<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Actually that reminded me to look at the etymology of "procrastinate". The root is the Latin "cras" meaning tomorrow, with "crastinus" being the genetive "of tomorrow", so that in Latin "to procrastinate" essentially means "to defer to tomorrow", see say<br><br><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/procrastinate" rel="nofollow">http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/procrastinate</a><br><br> Do It Tomorrow, anyone?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jaroslav<br><br>I think my ability to trust the system does vary.  For me it has been essential to be aware of any hard deadlines, so that I know that, if something does not stand out "in time" I can still "just do it". That is my safety net as it were. <br><br>The challenge for me is more in differentiating the "standing out".  When I look at the concept of standing out as "that which shouts loudest" then I start to act on perceived urgency and importance, ie listening more to my rational side.  I have to get back to the concept of standing out as being those tasks which I genuinely feel like doing, or want to do, rather than those I feel I ought to do.  Unfortunately, when stress from outside sources creeps into the equation it is harder to maintain that discipline and easier to do the urgent.</div>

<div class="content">"new super top secret system" hm.  That makes it sound very far away, since it will eventually become top secret, then just secret, then ... maybe a system?  In any case, I'd very much like to never have any sense of procrastination.  Yes.  That would be nice.</div>
