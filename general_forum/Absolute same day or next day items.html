<div class="content">Hi Mark and others, <br><br>I have a big problem with AF:  DIT fits so well with the working practices of my work place and my style of working. As a lot of the feedback on this forum is very positive about AF I would like to give it my best shot. I noticed that when using AF at home last weekend, stuck projects seemed to get moving very quickly. And I have a nagging thought in my mind that, in some ways DIT does not offer the apparent feature of AF: building one's goals and direction from the ground up.  DIT is great for *doing what you're doing* but maybe not as good as AF for cultivating new ideas or moving in a new direction?<br><br>The big hurdle for me at the moment is how to ensure that same day or next day items *definitely* get done? Any advice, Mark and others? Appologies if this has already been answered - I'd be happy to be re-directed.</div>

<div class="content">Leon:<br><br>Basically the answer is that if an item is (or becomes) so urgent that you need to do it now, you should do it as an exception to the AF process. Once you've done it you should continue with AF at the point you had reached before diverting to the exception.<br><br>If you think about it, this is basically the same as the way DIT processes "same day" items.</div>

<div class="content">I find myself doing things as they come up, for example someone will come to me and say I need this now, a lot of the time I don't get the chance to look at my list. Maybe that is my answer right there - to look through my list even when I am busy to act as 'triggers' <br><br>I haven't been adding more items since i started the list. Maybe I could have a rule to scan through the list first thing in the morning when I come in to work *before* doing anything else then perhaps i will be able to do some things before other people interrupt me!</div>

<div class="content">I have an amendment to AF that seems to cope with this. Same day items will nearly always be on the last or last but one page. Hence, at the start of the, or after a disruption. I will start my page reviews from the last but one page. In a way it fits in with the intuitive approach of AF - I use my intuition to decide which page to start from.</div>

<div class="content">I'm not sure if this is contrary to the system, but I find on days I'm really stressed out about items that MUST get done that day and there are too many to keep in my head - I write them at the end of the list and give myself the permission to work as much as I want on those tasks and keep going back to them even if they aren't the next page. I'll put a line (with the date) above it and a line below these urgent items so it essentially becomes a bit of closed box. But I keep this to stuff that must absolutely get done today or else. I put new items after the line and they don't get the benefit of this exception. <br><br>But as Mark says, it's an exception for urgent items - the goal is to have as few of these as possible so we can work the AF system normally which is a lot less stressful.</div>

<div class="content">Nick:<br><br>Everyone has some things which they have do deal with immediately, and these can't be handled in AF. AF is what you do when you are not handling an immediate job.<br><br>However you need to ask yourself the question, how many of these things are really that urgent? The very fact that you haven't been added any new items to AF suggests to me that you are tending to react to things, rather than deal with them systematically.</div>

<div class="content">Andy and Catherine:<br><br>In my experience AF is usually capable of handling "same day" items without needing to make an exception of them. I find I spend most of my time on the last couple of pages anyway, so they just get done naturally.<br><br>That works as long as "same day" means "can be done anytime today as long as it's finished by the end of the day". For items which need to be done sooner than that, I recommend dealing with them as exceptions. Deal with them when you feel that they can no longer be left undone, and then go back to where you were in the list before doing them. Don't be tempted to force yourself through pages to reach them, or to skip pages.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Mark - yes I probably do tend to 'react' to things and need to be more systematic!</div>

<div class="content">Nick. one thing I am finding is that AF is making it easier for me to say "no".  When someone comes up to you and says "I need this now" you are acting on that immediately.  The question is do they "need" it now or do they "want" it now?  If the latter then you are working to their timetable and not your own.<br><br>If someone asks me for something, whereas previously I would previously have probably just done it if it was a small item, I now add it to my list and say I will get back to them.  Interestingly that happened to me today and the person said to me "that's ok, I know if I ask you to do something you will always do it"  It struck me that that is not necessarily a good thing!</div>

<div class="content">When I was in the computer biz I had a sign on my wall:<br><br>"Yay, verily I say unto you: To whoever takes up the slack, more is given."<br><br>(I wrote it in nice chancery letters so it looked, at first glance, like one of those throw away biblical quotes people have on their walls.  ;-)  It reminded me to at least LOOK busy at all times, or stuff would find its way to my inbox because "I had time".  Well, I had time because I was on top of my stuff and was not really looking to do other people's stuff.  ;-)  In fact, there is an oft quoted maxim which goes:<br><br>"If you want something done, give it to a busy person."<br><br>Which acknowledges that busy people are more efficient.  Of course, it is grossly unfair to those people because they end up don't the work that the less efficient people don't find time to do.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark and everyone, <br><br>Thanks for your ideas. As an example, I arrive at the office in the morning and empty my case notes into my in-tray. From these notes are, say 11 tasks ranging from 5mins to 30 mins that must be done (under current government guidlines) the same day. In this scenario would it be most efficient to write something to the effect of 'same day tasks' or 'clear Intray' etc. Or would it be more accurate to put the task into AF and jot next to it 'same day'? Same with phone calls and emails - we are supposed to make an initial contact back within 24 hours, so how would that be organized within AF? Would it be appropriate to put 'emails' and cross it out and re-write when some work has been done on it? The overriding concern is that a same day item gets missed (falls through the cracks) and that this reflects badly on my time management skills.</div>

<div class="content">Leon,<br><br>I'm also finding that this is an important area to get right. The approach I'm working on now is<br>- if it is clearly now it gets started now<br>- if it must be at a certain time then it goes in my calendar<br>- each morning I quickly scan all pages, starting from where i left off (and will restart), to get a "shape" of likely same-day workload. If it is far from where I'm starting the day then I realise I'll have to work through the preceding pages quickly! Starting and doing one item on each page is usually doable.<br>- if it must be done today it goes into AF with a time attached. As I'm usually going around all pages once per day this usually picks these items up. Where it hasn't... it's been a day late but has had no impact.<br><br>I think it will be useful to have some notes in the post-Beta AF guide on how to manage these, and how to cycle through the set of pages in a sufficent time to handle them.</div>

<div class="content">Leon,<br><br>Does it really make sense to write down the items in your inbox on your AF list?  It would seem more logical, to me, to just start working on your inbox, taking one thing out at a time and doing it.  Use the AF list for non-routine things.  The same idea applies to email.  I can't imagine seeing 10 new emails and writing 10 entries: "Handle email 1 ... handle email 2 ..."  I'd just work the email as a routine task.  But then that's just me.  ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Thanks guys,<br><br>Mike, your right, it would make no sense at all to list each email - however there may be tasks associated with an email therefore I'm guessing that task would go into AF at that point.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Leon,<br><br>For email, I'd be tempted to just drag the email to the task folder and make it a task at that point.  (I'm using Outlook, of course).  Personally, email is one thing I would keep out of AF, unless it triggered a large task.  Here's one.  My wife is a band director and has a show using the Theremin.  I got an email yesterday that amplification had been approved and we should buy a Theremin.  There are a few things to do before I am ready to plunk down cash so that item went on my AF list.  If I were glued to the computer, I might have made an Outlook task out of it.  But another email was along the lines of: "Could you convert this PDF file for me" and I did not even write it down, I just did it after I read the email.<br><br>This sounds like one of those really personal areas where work style and environment dictates what will work.</div>

<div class="content">Mike/Leon<br><br>The way I handle email, for what it's worth, is to have an AF task to "check email".  When that jumps out I do it for as long as I feel like, file most emails or deal with them immediately, and make specific tasks for the rest.  (I then transfer them into a separate folder called Autofocus so I know where they are when the associated task pops out but that is pure personal preference).  I feel I am processing my mail regularly and am not forgetting tasks arising from them.  <br><br></div>

<div class="content">Thanks Christine,  the idea of an 'Autofocus' folder sounds useful.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>Good point, those "same day" items are sometimes desirable rather than essential, and as I'm an early starter they usually get dealt with as part of a morning sweep.<br><br>Thanks for all your work and feedback here.</div>

<div class="content">Jonathan<br><br>i've certainly been finding by putting routine and apparent same day items into my lists that it does help to identify whether they genuinely had the urgency level I was placing on them.</div>
