<div class="content">I am in the position of having a single AF2 handwritten notebook, and 3 AF1 computer files which I have not opened since I switched (save to move over a handful of time critical tasks).<br><br>How are people handling the transition? I would like to avoid a mass dumping, but I know I am missing a few choice projects from the AF1 files. Should I add tasks like this to AF2: "Find three items from the Studio AF1 list that stand out (-ish) and write them at the end of the AF1 notebook"?<br><br>How are people managing this issue who have elected not to continue with their AF1 book or list?</div>

<div class="content">My choice was to pick the time bombs from my AF1 lists and schedule the work for those items. The rest of the AF1 items will get reviewed weekly to see if anything has started ticking.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Rainer. I was also thinking about things which will not start "ticking", but which came to mind naturally through intuitive process. But your suggestion of looking through the old lists weekly might work also for these, but how to pick them out? As they will never become urgent, perhaps I should be methodical and see if one or more stands out to be moved, as a repeating AF2 task..</div>

<div class="content">Just a thought Laurence but you could use the AF2 dismissal system on your old lists - that should crystallise the mind as to whether the items should be moved or dismissed.</div>

<div class="content">I have a task "Review AF1 List" on my AF2 list. Whenever that stands out, I transfer up to four items from the old list - just the ones that kind of stand out. At the same time, I cross of items I have added to the AF2 list without looking at the AF1 list.<br><br>Why exactly four? I don't know, but it seems to be a good number - not too much to look like a mass dump, but enough for some freedom in choosing.</div>
