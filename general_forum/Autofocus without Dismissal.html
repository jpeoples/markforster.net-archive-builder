<div class="content">I'm still using AF1 because I find AF2's dismissal rules somewhat awkward. And, well, because AF1 works for me.<br><br>Mark, you wrote that the hardest part for AF2 was to figure out how to handle dismissing. Did you make any experiments without dismissal rules? As far as I can see, dismissing is essential in AF1, otherwise the list would grow and grow. With dismissing I regain focus. AF2, however, has another focus: by working backwards earlier items become more and more distant. Eventually, while they are still on the list, technically, they are clearly no longer in focus.</div>

<div class="content">For me all items are now in focus, b/c the very first thing to do after drawing the line is to review all open items.  And then I'm forced to either do the oldest item on my list that day or dismiss it (I've not had any "blocks" of open items).<br><br>I have to say that before trying to work AF2, the whole thing of going to the end & working backwards didn't make sense to me, but once I tried it, I found that I worked the list at a much more steady pace than I did in AF1.  Is it b/c it's new to me or b/c AF2 just works?  We'll see in the long run. :)</div>
