<div class="content">Hi everyone, <br><br>Thanks to Mark's DIT and other Methods I have actually started my 'All Cards and Christmas Presents for 2008 are Sorted out' Goal. From a note on my Potential Current Initiatives List it has now become a fully fledged Goal. I am also using Mark's 4 Step Goal Achievement Method as a Structure. <br><br>This is no mean feat... it's only the 13th of November, so by my calculations that's 42 days head start on what I have been doing every previous year. I usually start my Christmas shopping on 24th December at about 4pm. So thanks again to Mark as I think this will seriously reduce my stress levels this year!</div>

<div class="content">Leon,<br><br>Congratulations on your excellent progress. I don't recall seeing the Four-Step Goal Achievement Method in the DIT book. Is that where I can find it?<br><br>Thanks,<br>moises</div>

<div class="content">moises:<br><br>I think Leon is referring to my four-part article called "Getting to Your Goals". If you use the search box at the top of the left hand margin you will find it.<br><br>Leon:<br><br>Congratulations on the incredible feat! Me, I'm sticking to 4 p.m. on Dec 24th!</div>

<div class="content">Thank you guys. I have always found it a unifying experience, witnessing leagues of men scrambling for last minute presents with a look of terror in their eyes! But I think I will try a new strategy for this year. Maybe I can use the free time on a Christmas drink ;). <br><br>Moises, I think Mark's 4 Step strategy is spot on. I needed something that was simple to implement without the need for initial lengthy planning sessions, as this can contribute to further resistance and procrastination. Also, I have a history of being pretty lousy at completing Projects / Goals. The reason for this has been down to not knowing how to monitor my progress. I now have a solution to this problem! <br><br>I have adapted Mark's format slightly to my own template to incorporate his advice on 'Countdown Scoring' (when it is difficult to objectively measure a goal) and 'Guilty Goals' (Creating a list of positive reasons to complete the Goal). <br><br></div>

<div class="content">An update on my christmas presents project...Using Mark's ideas re the 4 Step Goal Strategy and Countdown Scoring, I have just 30% of this project remaining, and we are still in November! The 'little and often' concept is working a treat on this project, as is monitoring the project at regular intervals.</div>

<div class="content">Well done, Leon - and even I have succeeded in doing quite a large chunk of my Christmas shopping!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark and others, A final update on my christmas presents project...Well it is officially complete! Although I have been stalking the aisles today for 2 final gifts this has been much more manageable than in previous years. <br><br>In the final analysis I would say that getting the remaining 20% done on this project has been the most difficult. Maybe this follows Pareto's and others observations that 20% of the effort will bring 80% of the results (or in this case maybe it was other people procrastinating over their Santa Lists!). <br><br>So for me the other success with this project has been in learning  to physically monitor my progress and acknowledge that to *complete* many projects may require that final push to nail it.  <br><br>A merry christmas and a happy new year to everyone!</div>

<div class="content">Well done, Leon! <br><br>Though, inspired by your example, I actually beat you to it.<br><br>Mind you, I've still got the wrapping to do!</div>
