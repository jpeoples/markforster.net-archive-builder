<div class="content">I tried something new today: I took the time to add up how long I expect my A-list to take. (Yes, everything on the list is important, but some days I need to focus on a shorter list.) 90 minutes, and I have 120 to do them. I have a just-for-fun project I'd love to do in that last 30 minutes. (Thanks to the person here who talked about kanban and time management for the idea. Your videos are on my AF list.)<br><br>One of the tasks was tidy my desk, estimated at 15 minutes. I got side-tracked about half-way, and the beeper has beeped.<br><br>Normally, I'd ignore the timer and keep working at the desk, fighting opening against the shiny boxes and pulling time from other projects.<br><br>Today, with the list of times in front of me, I see that if I don't move to the next task I won't have time to do everything. I'm going to move on to the next task. If it holds my attention better, then it's the one I should be doing. If it doesn't, I won't be any worse off than on the first task.<br><br>At the end of the list I'll use some of that 30-minute float to go back to an uncompleted task, but not worry too much about it.</div>

<div class="content">Result: I got everything else done. I spent extra time on a few things when I was on a roll (and a few short breaks between tasks) so didn't get my 30 minutes of free time, but everything on the list got more attention than they would have gotten if I'd insisted on finishing my desk first.<br><br>It might not be the right way to do every day, but today it worked well.</div>

<div class="content">Hello this is " working in time burst" When I was a student I did nt like school. And doing my home work was really hard to me. So I decided to give a short time for every thing. It jhelped me a lot. Finaly i realized i could do the best of it and do it right. Fix a time bust for every thing is indeed a realy good thing.</div>
