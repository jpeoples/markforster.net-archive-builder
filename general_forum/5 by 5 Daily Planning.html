<div class="content">I just want to mention a method of planning which I believe works well with a No List system.<br><br>I first heard about it from Peter Voogd and he calls it the 5X5 system. However I prefer the name 5 by 5...<br><br>Anyway it's a simple daily planning method where in the morning you spend 5 mins planning out your day in rough. At night you spend a few moments scanning over your day to review it.<br><br>The days when I do this I find I'm more focused and energised (at least before external distractions get to me) than the days I don't.<br><br>I use a Collins' A6 Day per Page Calendar for mine though I guess you can use any notebook.<br><br>At the top of the page I write down the theme for the day. (If I'm doing a no list system this goes on the top of the list too.)<br><br>Under that I write down the one task that absolutely needs to be done that day. Below that I record 2 more important, but not essential, tasks.<br><br>I then ask 3 questions:<br>What am I excited about today?<br>What am I grateful for today?<br>What am I committed to today?<br><br>In the evening I ask, and answer, these 2 questions:<br>What went well today?<br>What could've gone better today?<br><br>Under that, in the last couple of lines I write out my major goal for the next few months.</div>
