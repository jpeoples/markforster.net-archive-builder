<div class="content">I always try the rules first. And then I borrow what works, and discard the rest. A tinge of guilt follows (perhaps the reason for this "coming out" post), but remind myself that this process is about finding hacks that work for ME.<br><br>As such, my AF system is slowly morphing into a hybrid of wishcraft/7 habits/AutoFocus. I'd love to see screencasts or videos of how y'all work your non-orthodox AF system. Would anyone else be interested in something like that? <br><br></div>
