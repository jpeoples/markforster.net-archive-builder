<div class="content">Has anyone tried IE8? Is it an improvement on IE7? Would anyone use it in preference to Firefox and/or Chrome?</div>

<div class="content">My son installed IE8 on my computer at home last weekend. IE7 refused to run on my XP machine.<br><br>IE8 itself looks like an imitation of Firefox, it's okay.<br><br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">I am running Internet Explorer 8.  I think it is a nice upgrade from version 7.  Now, whether or not it is better than Firefox....hmmm...might start some wars here if we get into that!  I do like Firefox and have that as well.<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">The only reason I ever lament at having Mac OS X is that I cannot run Chrome wthin it. It is  by far the best browser in terms of speed and once google gives it a few tweaks, I cannot imagine why most folks would want to use something else.<br><br>IE is utter junk IMHO.</div>

<div class="content">NEVER WILL. IE is the ghdgshkqsgxfq:(( program of this earth !<br>Lot off bugs, virus, worms, ready to open doors to every spam I hate IE !<br>I work on Mac so Safari is OK, Firefox is better, Chrome will be an app killer !</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>Consider that if you install IE8 you might not be able to go back ... or so I've heard.  I have not used it and won't until forced to.  I'm using FireFox and only fall back to IE7 when some site (usually Microsoft) won't work with anything but IE.</div>

<div class="content">I've been using IE8 for a while.  My default is still Firefox, and that will remain.  I found myself really avoiding using IE7 unless absolutely necessary, but sometimes on a whim I will run IE8.  It runs much quicker than IE7, still not quite as fast as Firefox 3.  If you already have IE7, I'd go ahead and upgrade to IE8.   FYI, my experience with both browsers has only been on Windows XP.</div>

<div class="content">IE7 is my last resort browser as I use Opera (10 alpha, if needed in obfuscation mode) else Firefox or IE7.  The day after installing IE8 discovered that a IE only site was not working even in compatibility mode, so I went back to IE7.  IE8 is probably a decent browser but then so many browsers are good or better.</div>

<div class="content">Another vote for Chrome here, IE too much of a security risk for me.</div>

<div class="content">From the view of a web developer, IE8 is a massive improvement over IE7, which was a massive improvement over IE6. If Microsoft keeps that up, IE10 or 11 it will have caught up to Firefox, Opera, Safari and Chrome. ^_^<br><br>Personally, I use Firefox. IE has only one function for me: Windows Update. And for that, it matters little if it's 6, 7 or 8.</div>

<div class="content">I liked the look of IE8 when I downloaded the Beta on another PC but as it kept crashing and created havoc (total understatement) when I tried to uninstall (you can't go back) am somewhat wary.  I've never been so comfortable with other browsers - perhaps I just need to persevere - but suspect I will install v8 now it is (hopefully) more stable.</div>

<div class="content">I am just testing QT web  <a href="http://www.qtweb.net/," rel="nofollow">http://www.qtweb.net/,</a> it promises! <br> Firefox works best for me because ofl extension called Scrapbook <a href="http://amb.vis.ne.jp/mozilla/scrapbook/" rel="nofollow">http://amb.vis.ne.jp/mozilla/scrapbook/</a>  ( save Web page or a snippet, edit it, highlight, organise the collection  , search, add notes). There are programs that do the same and more like Evernote.</div>

<div class="content">Mentioned this in an older post, but I too love Chrome. Haven't upgraded to IE 8. <br><br>I've found Chrome replace my use of other browsers, the speed  and responsiveness is addictive. Why use anything slower.<br>All the other browsing I do is done in Firefox which I have packed with extremely useful add-ons. Definitely can recommend the services like Silvia is mentioning (I still use the similar google notebook even if it has stopped development).<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Thanks everyone for your comments. I think I'll stick to my present Firefox and Chrome set-up, especially now that the only site I *had* to use IE for, BBC iPlayer, now works with Firefox.</div>

<div class="content">One further query:<br><br>I'd stick to Chrome as my only browser but for one thing - I cannot get Youtube videos to work on it. Has anyone had the same problem - and if so is there a solution?</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>I just tried it and a video played ... picture, sound and all ;-)  I'm running Vista with all of the latest patches, FWIW.</div>

<div class="content">Big ? on the youtube not playing Chrome. Mark, can you retry this and if you don't get the video to play, can you post the URL.<br><br>Since youtube is google property, it would be outsane for it to have any problems with the site.<br><br>Having said that, Chrome sometimes acts oddly when editing gmail.<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Thanks to everyone who replied on this.<br><br>Having researched the problem via Google, it appears that it was caused by Kaspersky Internet Security. I've fiddled with the settings and it now works.</div>
