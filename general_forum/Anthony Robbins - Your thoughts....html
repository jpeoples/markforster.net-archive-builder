<div class="content">Some of you know that I throw my theoretical lot into the Psychodynamic and Bowenian Systems school of thought (and practice). However, when it comes to implementation, I've always turned to various forms of self-help, religious discipline, etc. So when I had an opportunity to purchase 3 Anthony Robbins sets (Live with passion, Get the edge, Personal power ) for $30, I did it. <br><br>So far it's good. Real good. <br><br>Anyone else enjoy his material? <br><br>For the naysayers... have you DONE the exercises?</div>

<div class="content">I enjoyed one of his books, I never took the step to buy the courses as the infomercial was a bit cheesy for me.  I am always a bit skeptical of people who made their money selling self-development products as it is not the way regular people need to succeed.  That being said, I would love to hear a review and for $30 if you get a few good ideas the purchase is worthwhile.<br><br>Gerry<br><br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div>

<div class="content">Tony Robbins, Joe Vitale, Rhonda Byrne have made money selling concepts, ideas and success programs.  A regular person makes their living in a much different way.  So when they talk about how successful they are it may be in a different context than your life. <br><br>It reminds me of the people selling real estate courses, stock trading programs etc.  If they were so good, why would you sell the secrets to a bunch of people to compete with you when you could be a nameless millionaire. <br><br>So if you are an accountant looking to improve your practice, it may be better to study successful accountants who have done what you want to do.  It is more specific to your needs.<br><br>A lot of stuff sold is marketing.  This is why my ebooks are less than 15 pages.  I can't do fluff.  I just write about simple systems that work and try not to oversell what they can do.  Of course if someone uses Desired Outcomes to become a billionaire, I would certainly be happy.<br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://simple-time-management.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://simple-time-management.com</a></div>

<div class="content"><<Tony Robbins, Joe Vitale, Rhonda Byrne>><br><br>In my field, we measure each founder, and theory, on it's own merits. So while Freud, Erikson and Kohut are all analysts, they vary in approach, theory, etc. <br><br>Back to Robbins...<br><br><<A regular person makes their living in a muh different way>><br><br>Is there a "regular person"? Most of my friends who look like Cubicle Joe yearn to break out of corporate life. <br><br><<A lot of stuff sold is marketing>><br><br>I've heard this criticism before. However the program(s) I have provide a day by day regiment for self-improvement. For example: yesterday I listened to Tony discussing AM rituals to start you day off on the right foot. No marketing, no gimmicks. Very similar to what the CBT/MBSR folks preach. <br><br>Folks, if you're a naysayer, I'm curious why the program didn't work for you.</div>

<div class="content">I may not have been clear.  I do not think there is anything wrong with self improvement programs, I have read a lot and some are helpful.  I just find them too general.  For many people getting really great at a very marketable skill may lead them to where they want to go faster than a general improvement program.  I know many more successful people who have no interest in self improvement than those who embraced self improvement and made significant changes and became successful.<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">Hi Avrum<br>I'm glad to see you back.  Although I don't endorse Mr. Robbins, the example of AM rituals kind of supports Gerry's post.  Everybody already knows about starting off your day.  Robbins is merely packaging it.........but........OHOT.....if the packagine helps you in ways that you can't muster up for yourself, then I wouldn't even bother asking for other folks' reviews.  If it helps you, then you already have your best personalized review!  You're a very smart guy, Avrum.  I know that you'll carve out your own methodology using whatever aides are necessary!<br>psssttt....I use mind tricks on myself quite often to keep the habits regular and to trick myself into willingness against the resistance obstacles.  So what?  Doea that make me a lesser person?  NO!  I'm not unethical nor am I climbing on someone else's back!  We all need to find our ways to stay current, get ahead, etc.  And there's no shame in getting support from whatever source.<br>I'm rooting for your success no matter how you forumulate it for yourself....even if it involves Tony Robbins!  Heck, many folks would poo poo some of my tricks that work really well for me!  (...and I'm sure you remember that I'm not afraid to get a bit ridiculous and radical if that's what it takes!  LOL!)<br><br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content"><<Although I don't endorse Mr. Robbins>><br><br>But Learning - this is why I'm asking. It would seem, certain ideas are rejected on the basis of anther's opinion, which is formed from another opinion. <br><br>I've said this before -  every colleague I've spoken to - who has rejected psychoanalysis - has never studied, nor practiced, psychoanalysis. <br><br>How does this happen? Another example: very religious Jew I know rejects the validity of Christianity. They know nothing about Christianity, have neither studied nor practiced it, but reject it nonetheless. And with fervor. <br><br>So again - I'm curious if any Mark Forster fan's - many of whom have sampled everything from mindfulness to GTD - have tried, and rejected, A. Robbins ideas? Alternatively, have any of you absorbed his ideas into your daily planning/goal setting.</div>

Rather, I wonder why he receives so much flak from people who DON'T use his program. <br><br>I have no problem rejecting 40-50% of Mark Forster's ideas (AF - DWM), because I've studied, and used them. Of course, I'm thrilled to promote (and use) the 50% that I find immensely useful.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Avrum<br>Don't throw rotten tomatoes at me for this post.  You asked me afterall......Because of my disabilities AND my natural aversion to boring scut (yet I willingly endured DECADES of boring, repetitive practice toward mastery of athletics, dancing, playing musical instruments, learning something that I don't resond to quickly, etc....) I NEED to maintain my internal strength and determination.  Outside forces don't cut through high levels of pain, highly potent drugs, and tolerating brain injuries.  Bottom line:  I'm in a totally different set of circumstances than you.  Who knows?  If I wasn't disabled and needed some sort of assistance about something that Mr. Robbins offered, I'd probably be willing to give his system a go if I thought it would help!<br>Plus, I'm also operating on a nonsensical bias.....His huckstering seems a bit oily so I'd have to break through that bias before I could benefit from him.  Avrum, we all have our unique ways of approaching and rejecting.....Opinions are just that.....a grain of truth wrapped up in a thich package of personal bias!  LOL!<br>But....but...but....you own opinions are your personal guiding system that you've developed over the years.  I'd be more inclined to trust your own opinion in matters of trial and error.  It's not that you're going in blind to have an experimental organ transplant.  You're merely testing a methodology....see what happens.....and come back to give us YOUR review!<br>I hope it offers you improvement and leads you to your idea of success!  Now start gathering your experiental data for your review....Mazel Tov!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Hey Avrum, at the risk of being mocked by Norman for the 100th time this month, I'll be your Huckleberry.  Don't get p.o.'d about the response so far, you had to know that was coming.  ;-)<br><br>Yes I have - but it's been a LONG time, I think around 1995 or so?  It had a green case, can't recall which one it was, but I went through and did the stuff every a.m.  Usually when I take something on, that's what I do - although I'm not as anal about this now as I used to be.  They're on tapes not CD's anyway, if that's any indication of how long ago.  <br><br>Just my personal preference, but even though I'm generally a reader, I liked the audio better for him.  Especially if you're doing the program as it's meant to be done.  It's not meant to be read or listened to and then put on the shelf but to actually DO something.  The writing really helps.<br><br>If you really want to talk the talk with people who have walked the firewalk, I'd go to his forum.  IIRC, you can set up a journal there and get feedback from others on stuff like your 10 DMC's, dani, etc etc. <br><br>You might find there's good things about TOYL too.<br><br>Rainer, I don't think RPM is complicated, is it?  It's kind of a part of what I do now.  I had to do the chunking part to save my sanity after AF.</div>

Basically you stand up and move your arm backward and see how far you can go, set a new target and try it again - you go much further.  This concept has been very interesting, and very thought provoking.<br><br>Some of his stuff is cheesy, but other concepts he gives are things I had not thought about before going through his material.</div>

<div class="content">Hey Steve, why not use both?  Shallow Hal was surprisingly good, although I'm not a Gwyneth fan.  Although this video was good.:<br><a href="http://www.theonion.com/video/iron-man-2-buzz-heats-up-over-rumors-gwyneth-paltr,17275/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.theonion.com/video/iron-man-2-buzz-heats-up-over-rumors-gwyneth-paltr,17275/</a><br><br>Heheh Vickie, thanks for the compliment, someone less charitable could also say I was kind of messed up about 15-20 years ago too. :-)  But I think it's more something Avrum alluded to above - I just don't like to say something's b.s., bad or doesn't work unless I've tried it or at least thought through how it would apply personally if I don't want to take the time or $ to do it.  And just because something didn't work for me because I've tried it at one point doesn't mean that it wouldn't work for someone else or even work for me at a different period in life.  <br><br>When I moved down to TX, everyone was telling me how horrible it was.  They didn't even say "I heard that it's...", they'd say "It is..."  - and they'd never been there.  This stuff happens all the time.  Guess it's best not to ask for feedback on things.  Sigh... :-(<br><br>Of course, you lose the security of dogmatism - which is a trade-off.  Meh, I'll leave that to other people who have the personality for it.  I just find it sad that we shut ourselves off from so many things or experiences because of our pre-conceived notions.  Having said that, I won't go out and get audited by L. Ron's minions next week - but I wouldn't remove it as a future possibility.  If I do, I'll report back on my findings.  ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Avrum,<br>it's funny how some of us seem to walk down similar paths. I too have started off with GTD, found my way to this site and just recently started to listen to a Tony Robbins audio set (Get the edge, Perosnal Power II). My experience: I really enjoy listening to him, he is such a good and energetic speaker. Personal Power II however was a bit too repetitive for me. Get the edge is the same content but more condensed. I find the program helpful to increase motivation and re-focus. The health section is a bit weird, I don't recommend his ideas in this field.<br>Dino</div>

He lost me when he decided that he was also a nutrition guru and came up wiith something he called "water rich foods".  Reminds me a lot like Jucing where you take about half of the good stuff in veggies and throw it away so you can feel as if you are getting the best stuff.  And then buy pills to replace what you just threw away.  LOL ;-)<br><br>Personally, I prefer Robbins in written form, I can then not hear him screaming.<br><br>But I often recommend him.

<div class="content">Gerry,<br><br>>>>  Tony Robbins, Joe Vitale, Rhonda Byrne have made money selling concepts, ideas and success programs. A regular person makes their living in a much different way. So when they talk about how successful they are it may be in a different context than your life.  <<<<br><br>I'm not sure what a "regular person" is.  But beyond that, is the stuff you sell invalid for me because I don't write ebooks about time management systems?  My guess would be that at least YOU think that the things you say apply to everyone.  Likewise, advice that Tony Robbins gives is not applicable only to those selling "success programs on late night TV".<br><br>>>>  It reminds me of the people selling real estate courses, stock trading programs etc. If they were so good, why would you sell the secrets to a bunch of people to compete with you when you could be a nameless millionaire.  <<<<br><br>I take your point but there is also a distinction.  He is not selling a course on how to be a marketing genius.  He is selling a course giving ideas that apply to ANYONE who wants to be successful in reaching their goals ... no matter what they are.<br><br>To some extent you are right.  One does have to look to the man to evaluate his advice but even there it works.  At fist glance his relationship advice might be suspect as he was divorced after going on and on about how smart he was in that area ... but if you think about it, he broke is OWN rules by cheating on his wife.  And that will get you in trouble every time.  ANYONE will tell you that.<br><br>>>>  So if you are an accountant looking to improve your practice, it may be better to study successful accountants who have done what you want to do. It is more specific to your needs.  <<<<br><br>But if your problem is in the area of developing goals, generating motivation to take appropriate action, fighting resistance, etc., what good is advice on general accounting going to do you.  Even the accountant would profit from his ideas.<br><br>>>>  A lot of stuff sold is marketing. <<<<br><br>I could go on and on about what is WRONG with him and the way he does bsiness. but the point is not so much to find reasons to criticize but to find things that are useful.  What do I care if his genius is in repackaging and marketing ideas.  Good for him.  It is the ideas that I am interested in.<br><br>>>>  This is why my ebooks are less than 15 pages. I can't do fluff. I just write about simple systems that work and try not to oversell what they can do. <<<<br><br>Two observations at this point.  First, the advice to write your To Do list in a steno pad hardly needs even 15 pages.  ;-)  secondly, while he spends a lot of words, I'm not sure that they are not necessary for everyone.  Some people need to hear stories.  That is demonstrably true, I'd think, because every one who has written a "success" book has followed the same formula, from Dale Carnegie to Zig Ziglar they all tell stories.  That seems to be important to people.  That I, and it seems you, don't care about that kind of "filler" does not mean that others see it as "filler".  It is there for a reason.<br><br>Thirdly, I'm not sure how you know he is overselling.  He is certainly selling like a madman, but I think he is right on target with the effectiveness of his ideas.  What it is probably wise NOT to get hooked into his his "machine" (for want of a better term.)  He has pacaged an amazing setup where you spend $10 for a book which gets you to spend $100 for an audio course then $1,000 for an "event", then $10,000 for consultation, etc.  It seems as if every "level" costs about 10x what the previous level does ... and there is not much beyond that first $10 ... unless the hysterical screaming motivates you more than the words on papef would.<br><br>>>>  Of course if someone uses Desired Outcomes to become a billionaire, I would certainly be happy.  <<<<br><br>One uses "desired outcomes" to get ANY outcome one desires.  I'm not sue what you could mean by that.</div>

<div class="content">Steve,<br><br>Re: Shallow Hal.  TR was also pretty funny in "Men in Black" where if you look closely, he is one of the pictures on the TV showing the Aliens living among us.  Cracked me up.  But other than a joke, I think the question was about the material, not the man, and certainly not the swipes others who are probably more jealous than anything else, take at him.<br><br>And, BTW, I think it is a sad commentary that the first thing people look for in someone who offers advice is how they may have feet of clay.  Yeah, if the ADVICE is wrong it is wrong ... but you judge that by analyzing the advice, not by looking for ways to criticize the giver.  I'm sure if Ben Franklin wrote a diet book I'd be a bit skeptical, but I'd criticize the book based on the advice in it, not Ben's figure.</div>

I think that much of the criticism is aimed at the man, and not the ideas, which few people understand or assimilate.  How can anyone argue with ideas like:<br>develop goals and write them down then take immediate action on them instantly ... before you put the pencil down?</div>

<div class="content">BTW, in case anyone is interested in persuing this whole approach further ...<br><br>Tony Robbins has repackaged some of the most easily accessible ideas from NLP (Neuro Linguistic Programming) with some of the more traditional time management and basic success ideas such as goal setting and making and following a To Do list.  (His RPM is not much more than an integration of goals/values and tasks to implement the goals.  It is unique in that it keeps them right in front of you ... but it is not magic at all.)  If you wanted to get a deeper understanding of the theory behind some of his stuff you'd go to the material published by and about Ricard Bandler, John Grinder, Steve Andreas, Robert Dilts, etc.  (And don't even get me started on wacko presentation style when it comes to Bandler.)</div>

ROTFL<br>But, thank you none the less.  I appreciate that you notice that my intentions are decent and my ROI is mostly burning tons of mental fuel just pushing myself to stay even many days....<br>Using a metaphor, my efforts spent are like comparing the MPG of a 66 Impala vs a current hybrid auto!

<div class="content">Mike,<br><br>You may have missed my point.  I am trying to say for many people, they do not need a general self development program, they may need more specific skills, like become a better accountant, learn to do estate taxes, learn to sell better, etc.  In this instance, they are better off developing specific skills versus general skills.  My point about Gurus is many brag how successful they are and how wealthy they are, but they earned the money selling self-help which is not what most people do.  Yet, they have you believe that if you follow their program you will be wealthy as well.  For most people developing specific marketable skills is a better way to go.  Just my opinion<br><br>Some of my ebooks develop specific time management skills which is what they are designed to do.  If someone needs this skills that is what they are for.  Please note the Steno notebook method is not an ebook, it is short article at ehow.  I agree, it does not need to be long.   As I have evolved my thinking, I have become simpler and found I was just as effective with this method as any other and so I don’t need an involved Time Management System.  This is why I now give all of this stuff away for free.<br><br>Desired outcomes is a way for people to achieve any life goal, you might say like a Tony Robbins program but condensed down to useable steps.<br><br>Lastly, I meant specifically my ebook Desired Outcomes, if someone uses the program to become a billionaire, I would be happy.  Hey with that testimonial I could give Tony a run for his money.  Thanks for the dialogue.<br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div>

<div class="content">Gerry, I think the "specific skill" programs can take you to a certain point, but no further.  A certain change in your mindset has to occur to go from average to great and that's what self-development programs like TR and the ilk *may* do for people.<br><br>For example, I'm a pretty decent accountant, that's something I learned as a skill in university - yet for years I continually took jobs where I under-earned compared to what I was capable of in the market.  It's programs like TR's that increased my income by a factor of 5-10 times in a very short period of time.  I was the same decent accountant, still had goals or "desired outcomes" or whatever you want to call it but had to dig pretty deep into internal motivations to make my goals realizable.  Another accounting course wouldn't have done that for me.<br><br>I understand where you're coming from with the gurus making money off the self-help industry - there's a whole lot of those people around.  I prefer too to see people who have been successful in an unrelated business then move into self-help (a few Brits come to mind - Felix Dennis, Duncan Ballantyne etc. and I suppose on this continent we have Tim Ferriss, Donald Trump and Steve Pavlina - hmm - and there's always good old Ben Franklin) - but just because they can DO it themselves, may not mean that they understand how to teach it to others or apply it to anyone else who wasn't born with their mindset, had their experiences etc.  Sometimes the best teachers aren't the ones to whom things came naturally.  Mark himself is a case in point on that.  The best ones seem to be the ones who had to figure out how to overcome their own issues - some of which seem to be pretty universal conditions.</div>

<div class="content">Gerry,<br><br>I suppose that there are people of both kinds out there.  People who lack skill and need a training program or a tech school or something.  OTOH, there are those who have a skill but don't know how to be successful in using that skill.<br><br>As to why gurus are rich:  TR does not claim that he became rich because he sold books and tapes  His story is that he turned his life around by developing goals and pursuing them ... they just happened to be doing what he did.  What he "sells" is that if anyone follows that general way of doing things they can become successful doing whatever they what to do.  IOW it is not the content but the form that matters.<br><br>I grant your point the gurus they implicitly sell "wealth" as the end product of the program, but you don't have to buy that vision of success.  I also grant that if you have wonderful "success tools" but no specific "practical skills" you are not likely to get anywhere.<br><br>As to getting back to simpler systems ... I hear 'ya.  It does not take a big system to just get some things done.  Just writing them in a steno pad (or any other type of pad) would do the trick.<br><br>Oh, and I did not realize that "Desired Outcomes" was a proper noun.  Sorry about that.</div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline,<br><br>You make a good point about successful people not knowing or being able to explain how they did it.  That is the point of NLP, to model what people "really do" to get what they got.  It is a lot like a tennis coach, he usually was a good tennis player, but he might not have ever been as good in raw technical skill as the person he is coaching ... but he has a good idea of the necessary skills that the player might not have learned yet.<br><br>A good example is Richard Branson.  I've seen a number of interviews with him and he is always asked what made him successful and has never said much that explained it.  He is obviously successful and has many special skills as well as personality skills but either does not know or can't explain what the exact combination is.  Another example is Donald Trump -- he has written books explaining how he became successful but it is all pretty much self-serving BS.  If you tried to follow his advice you'd wind up nowhere.<br><br>It helps to develop skills to model people or have other people do it or you.  TR claims to have modeled successful people and is passing on that good information.  Well, I don't know, about that, but the basic ideas he has bundled DO seem to be used by most successful people.  And that is what is helpful ... programs or recipes that work in most situations.  You could get many of the same ideas from Ben Franklin, but the language in his books is somewhat tougher.</div>

<div class="content">Avrum, I've followed Tony Robbins for years. I've also worked with a woman who was a spokesperson for him... in my opinion he has stood the test of time (and this woman is a true mentor, leader, influencer). Yes, there might be some over-the-top stuff, but then in person he is bigger than life with an incredible energy. IMO in terms of goals and personal effectiveness, he's one of the best. What I'd like to know is... where did you have the opportunity to buy his materials for $30??</div>

<div class="content">Avrum,<br><br>>>>  I'm a sucker for good packaging & a program to follow. That's why I prefer the cd/dvd program vs. the book. The programs I'm using are well thought out, with strong production value.  <<<<br><br>His stuff can be spotty, so you are fortunate to have good programs.  He, like many others, often cuts and pastes audio from "events" he has done for various companies and so on and glues them into a "program".  I've also noticed that his programs sometimes "run out of steam".  IOW, if he has 10 tapes the first couple will be an hour long and the last might be 30 minutes and a lot lighter in content.  He sometimes also gets a bit repetitive ... possibly because of the cutting and pasting that was done.<br><br>Re: The books.  Some of his exercises take pen and paper work that is best done either from books or from printed material included with his audio programs.  I think that in general, the weakness in audio programs is that users don't take the time to do exercises so don't get the full benefit from the material.<br><br>>>>  Since I'm well versed in marital/family therapy, I'll skip his relationship advice.  <<<<br><br>It is pretty ordinary, IMO.  You can also safely skip is diet and exercise stuff as well.  (Other than the probably good advice to start the day with some meditation, breathing, stretching, and light aerobics with focused mental preparation.  I found that combination more useful than the what I had been doing.)<br><br>>>>  Besides, I'm using the program to boost my goal setting and project management. <<<<br><br>He does well in that area, IMO.  Especially is discussion of values.  Not many others discuss values in a general way.  IOW, those who discuss values prescribe them (like Covey) rather than suggest that you identify your own.  Also, using that developed hierarchy to evaluate the appropriateness of your tasks and goals is useful as well.<br><br>>>>  Interesting discussion. >>><br><br>Yes it is.  It would be interesting to hear, after you've had some time to evaluate, what things (or class of things) seemed to be useful to you and why.  Personally, I found his advice to build a hierarchy of values to be very helpful.  Values have always been a focus of mine but arranging them in a hierarchy never occured to me, for some reason.  DOH!<br><br>Also his focus on "questions" was very useful.  Perhaps the quickest and simplest way to change one's state of mind is though questions.  Particularly: "What is good about this?"  I was familiar with sentence completions and that sort of thing before but his take on it seemed more useful and less abstractly analytical.</div>
