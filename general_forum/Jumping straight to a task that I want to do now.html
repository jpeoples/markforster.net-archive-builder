<div class="content">One thing about AF2 that I'm struggling with a bit is the idea of working your way methodically down the list even if you know you have items further down you really want to do right now.<br><br>For example, just a few minutes ago, I remembered one of the tasks that was "on notice" today. Then I realized that right now would be a great opportunity to do it, so I just did it and it's now off my list.<br><br>I didn't methodically work my way down the list (from the newest to the oldest) looking for "stand out" items. It just felt like the right time so I did it.<br><br>I'm taking the view here that it's a judgement call in situations like this and my ultimate goal anyway was to get myself to do that task.<br><br>So I'm presuming it is okay to have an intuition-based "trump card" that you can play to override the system when it feels necessary?</div>

<div class="content">Well, the autofocus police won't be breaking down your door.<br><br>I have done the same thing.  Here is my only caveat.  If we could make a list and would always do every item on the list every day, then we would not need something like Autofocus.  I have three items this morning on notice.  I know I can finish these with no problem, so I will work my way through item by item, from the end of the list to the front, going back to the beginning according to the rules, and work those that "stand out" without worrying too much.  If it does get later in the day, the pressure to deal with the items on notice will probably keep other items from standing out and I will move down (or up, technically) the list faster.  But I do want to force myself to always work down the list and look at each item.  I find I will be more likely to do those items that I find I am resisting (or those I simply forgot about.)</div>

<div class="content"><< Well, the autofocus police won't be breaking down your door. >> <br><br>I wouldn't be so sure about that !<br><br>But seriously - I would be deceiving you if I said that I'd never done the same thing myself. But it's very important that it is the exception rather than the rule. Once you start getting into the habit of skipping to the beginning, you will have very little incentive to move *through* the list - which means that tasks at the centre of the list won't get any attention.</div>
