<div class="content">Hi Ladies and Gents :-)<br><br>Do any of you find yourselves getting distracted by certain time killing websites or programs when you really should be focusing on your Important Projects or your AF or SF list? I know I do! So I wrote a program to solve the problem.<br><br>It's called Distraction Blocker and it can block virtually anything you want on your computer for a specified time (Windows OS Only).<br><br>Please have a look:<br><a href="http://www.distractionblocker.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.distractionblocker.com</a><br><br>Many thanks!<br>Jon @ Distraction Blocker<br><br>(posted with Mark's permission)</div>

<div class="content">Seems like a good idea.  It's a bit techie to figure out, but I've got it.  It's kind of the opposite of the "mental strength exercise".<br><br>Allow Only mode doesn't seem to work at all: I can start any program, work any program.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Alan,<br><br>Thanks for trying it! :)<br><br>Oops! I'd broken the Allow Only mode in a recent update - I've fixed it now. Please re-run program or click 'Check for Update' from the tray menu and it will auto-update. Many thanks for that!<br><br>Jon</div>

<div class="content">Your website needs a way to contact you.  The automatic updater crashed.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Alan,<br><br>I will add a contact form to the site later, thanks.<br><br>My email is in the About box which you can view from Tray menu. It's just support @ (my domain)<br><br>Do you have any restrictive Windows permissions on your machine as that could make it fail? Or it could be your anti-virus/firewall blocking it?<br><br>Meanwhile, please update using the downloadable zip or installer exe from the homepage.<br><br>Jon</div>

<div class="content">Standard "Windows 7" restrictions.  I'm the admin, but installing software requires a secure mouse-click normally.</div>

<div class="content">OK I'll see if I can fix the auto-update so it works with Windows 7 UAC.<br>Did you update OK now from zip or setup exe ?</div>

<div class="content">The Auto-Update will only currently work if you run the program 'As Administrator'. I've updated the software to inform the user of this. Thanks</div>
