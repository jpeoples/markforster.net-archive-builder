<div class="content">My coworker started a SF notebook yesterday. She jotted down about a dozen tasks in C1. It's all she has right now, just a half-page list. So she started working on one of her tasks and got to a stopping point even though the task is not complete. Technically, the task gets rewritten in C2 of the next page. But for her, there *is no* next page. So where does it go? C2 of the current / only page? And if she works on it a bit more later but doesn't finish, does it get rewritten again in the same / current / only page?</div>

<div class="content">Since it's a circular list, the "next" page of a one-page list is the same page.  So yes, it would go in C2 of the current page.  <br><br>And if she works on it multiple times, she should continue re-writing it in C2 of the page as per the rules.  (At some point, she'll probably have a 2nd page, at which point the "next" page will be the 2nd page.)</div>

<div class="content">I find it's easier and more effective to ignore C2 until you start the second page. Contrary to the rules.</div>
