<div class="content">I'm looking forward to Mark's latest system. It's very interesting seeing the results of the poll and the numbers of people using the different systems. DWM did my head in and I never go that successfully off the ground. AF was a good system; I loved the way I could throw anything and everything at it. In the end though I struggled to incorporate repeating tasks satisfactorily. Also it gave me the feeling of working in a much more random way and never had the sense of completing a day's work, with so many tasks still waiting on the list. I've mainly stuck with DIT because of the psychological factor of having a clear and finite list of things I choose to do today. The downside is that too many days go by when I can't complete the list, like today when I'm not feeling well.<br><br>I don’t know what Mark’s new 'combined' system will be like, but my idea to get the best out of both AF and DIT is this.<br>Keep an AF list for capturing tasks as normal. Each morning (or the night before) check the day's schedule to see how much time is available today, then go through the AF list looking for items that stand out AND that can all be accomplished in the available time. On a busy day with little spare time, only perhaps two or three might go on the list. Write those tasks in the DIT task diary for today as your WILL DO tasks. New same-day urgent tasks can go below the line for today, with everything else going into AF as normal. <br><br>When today’s DIT tasks are finished, you have the choice of stopping, knowing you’ve accomplished your day’s work, or going back to AF and working on more tasks.  Uncompleted or repeating tasks are added back into the AF list. Pages in AF can be dismissed by the AF2 or AF4 methods or during a weekly review. The downside of this is the keeping of two lists but it does keep the flexibility of AF with the structure of DIT. <br><br>Apologies if this idea has been brought up/discussed/chewed to death in previous posts. Whew – that’s it for my feverish brain. I’m going for a lie down now.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Linda,<br><br>I have started doing this, using AF4 but with an added DWM twist-- Using Excel I track expiry dates based on Mark's rules. I use them to help decide whether to make something a WILL DO task or not.<br><br>I use AF4 rules for dismissal at this point, but can change to DWM if my backlog gets too big.</div>

<div class="content">Yes, if dates were incorporated, then dismissal could be by DWM rules rather than AF ones. I like that idea. That combines all three of Mark's systems!<br><br>I've got a shiny new A5 notebook (preferring paper to digital) which has three moveable section dividers - section 1 could be for the DIT task diary, section 2 for the AF list and section 3 for projects/jottings. It would keep everything together rather than carrying around my clunky page-a-day diary and separate AF/project notebooks.</div>

<div class="content">This system resembles the combination of a "grass catcher" list and a "today" list that Mike described in some posts. <br>Isn't this also a "classical" Franklin Planner-style system (sans the micro-prioritization promoted by Franklin Planner, Time/System et al.)?</div>

<div class="content">Alex,<br><br>Yeah, it seems that way.  But if you come at it from the perspective of function, most systems share the same functions.<br><br>Whatever system you use you have to have a "collection" function.  I call it my Grass Catcher, in the AF system it is the AF book, the same for DWM.  The traditional To Do list uses the list for that function.  GtD calls it the "in box".  Regardless, you have to have that function.<br><br>The other main function you need is some way to select tasks for execution.  GtD does it with it's "context lists", AF and DWM rely on you getting a feeling of what to do next.  The traditional To Do list has you pick them by some idea about importance/urgency.  The Covey system separates those two and has you prioritize based on Importance alone.<br><br>You need a function to keep track of appointments and deadlines.  It is also useful to have some kind of recording function so you know what you DID.<br><br>Some of these functions are not addressed by the main system (AF and DWM don't address appointments explicitly, for example) but the functions still need to be handled.  In that case, a way of managing them will be tacked on to the main system giving a more compressive solution.<br><br>In my case, I realized that AF was really my old Grass Catcher, and that I am not able to work without explicit prioritization/selection and scheduling of tasks.  So that is why I wound up scanning the AF list and culling tasks to a "hot list" of things to do that day.</div>

<div class="content">Mike<br><br>Is that the system you still use, or did you migrate to DWM (or something else)?</div>
