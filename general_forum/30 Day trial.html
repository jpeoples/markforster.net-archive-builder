<div class="content">I'm not so happy with my life at current and for me that is frustrating as i've given it an awful lot of thought. More than most I know. However one of the major problems is really getting things happening and really moving.<br><br>I've been thinking about stuff and what is the best way to run my life and I realized that it needed to be focused around what was interesting to me or to be more exact, finding the things that are interesting to me and then DOING them. Which to me is the same way that I look at the fundamentals of creativity (having great ideas/making them happen)<br><br>So after learning of this new system, I am quite excited by it, because it seems to fit in perfectly with this (scanning items looking for what stands out or what is interesting) <br><br>I have decided to commit to a 30 day trial of the system,starting on Monday. I've never committed to anything like this before, but I think it's important to give it a real shot. I will let you know what comes up/how it works out! <br><br>I'm not entirely clear on everything, but maybe I will use the system itself to clear those things up. I'm still going to have a central place to keep all my ideas (longer term) and perhaps pick a few current major projects to focus on. But the rest I will use AF for, including all new ideas. <br><br>This should be fairly interesting to see what happens!</div>
