<div class="content">It is just Alan Lakein meets "The Secret".  Lots of woo-woo attached to writing an ordered list and doing stuff.</div>

<div class="content">I read this once years ago.  It is a bit like the Secret in that it is about manifesting your goals.  I did not see a lot of discussion of working toward them, just "knowing" them.<br><br>Brian Tracy also has a method where you write your goals out each day not looking at the previous list.  Brian Tracy's idea was to do this for 30 days so the list can firm up and solidify the 10 most important goals.  He does take it a step further and says you can multiply the effectiveness by writing down three action steps toward achieving them.<br><br>I believe written goals are important, but I have a saying goals are not plans and plans are not actions.  You need all three to make it happen.<br><br>Gerald<br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div>
