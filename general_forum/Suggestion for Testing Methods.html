<div class="content">Mark, in the future, it may be helpful to get people to test the system who are willing to commit a certain time period to it say 30-45 days and agree to follow the directions as you write them.<br><br>Additionally, it may be helpful to have people hold comments until the end of the test and just have people ask questions during the testing phase to make sure they are doing the system correctly.  <br><br>At the end people can give their feedback and suggestions to improve the systems.  I think it would be more valuable to the process to lay some ground rules.  It is getting a bit chaotic.  Please note I am not slamming anyone, just trying to make the process smoother.<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">I do agree with Gerry - there is just far too much random information here on the blog for anyone to sensibly pick up.</div>

<div class="content">Yeah, I get Gerry's concern, but OTOH, one way to express how things are working, or not, is to propose tweaks that we think make it fit our way of working.  I'm supposing that Mark decodes those things to tease out information.  (Or maybe he's just drooling by now ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Simon H:<br><br><< there is just far too much random information here on the blog for anyone to sensibly pick up >><br><br>Yes, but this isn't the blog. This is the discussion forum, which is quite a different thing. The blog is where "official" amendments and pronouncements get put.</div>

<div class="content">Mark, just wonder whether it would make sense to post not only the current set of rules but also the modifications you already tried and failed with. This would avoid (at least for some of us) that people try the same modifications you already sorted out.<br><br>And I still stick to your rules  ;-)</div>
