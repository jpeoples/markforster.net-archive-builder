<div class="content">I am confused about when to stop reviewing a page and moving to the next one. Here's my actual situation:<br>Assume that I have one and a half pages of tasks. On day one, say, I go through the first page and I follow the procedure of going round the first page several times doing tasks that stand out and repeating this cycle until the end of the day. I then stop on day one because of lack of time. On which page should I start on day two? Would it be from the top of page one or page two?<br><br>An alternative situation for which I would appreciate your comments: Say you go through a particular page, doing tasks that stand out, but you have to stop (end of day) before you've had a chance to reach the bottom of the page. How do you mark the spot you reached on that page, that is the last task that you did? I ask this, because presumably one would start the following day's review from the spot that one finished on the previous day. Therefore, some means of marking the "reached here" point is needed.</div>

<div class="content">I restart at the top of the page. Remember, you have to review the whole page before you choose the standing out items. For me, the overall review fades overnight.</div>

<div class="content">Yes, I review the whole page again as well.  I even have 40 items on a full page and it takes not very long to get into the swing of things.  And I find I only get stuck on one page the first time I work through it.  After that there are fewer things to work through.<br><br>If you find you are getting stuck on one page too much, maybe reduce the number of items on each page a little.  Rule off a notes section at the bottom if you need to.</div>

<div class="content">After I've been away from the page overnight (or for any extended period), I always review the whole page before taking any action.<br><br>So, I'd start the next day on the same page; review the whole page; then start working through it from top to bottom as usual.<br><br>By "any extended period", I mean, long enough to "lose touch" with the page.  If I don't have a good feeling I know what's on the whole page, then I'll review the whole page, and start working again top-down.  So, it might not just be overnight.  It might be after I just spent 3 hours working on an item that was standing out, and I got so involved in it, I totally forgot what the rest of the items on my current page are.</div>

<div class="content">If I understand it correctly, I should proceed as follows:<br><br>Every day I should start with the last page on which I worked on during the previous day. I should preferably start at the top of that page and work my way down using the prescribed two-step procedure (see Quick Start steps 1 and 2), repeating this run through until no item stands out (Quick Start steps 3 to 5). I should then move on to the next page.<br><br>Quick Start step 7 comes into play as follows: Once I have been through all pages in the above fashion and I have started a new review cycle for a second or subsequent time, reviewing those pages that are still active, then the tasks listed on any page that I work on are subject to the dismissal rule. Special exception applies to the last page, that is the one most recently updated with new items.<br><br>Would you please confirm if what I wrote in the above paragraph is correct?</div>

<div class="content">Sounds right to me Otto.  I keep 2 little sticky notes as bookmarks in each of my books.  One for the last page where I'm writing new tasks, and one for the page I'm currently working on.  Then if I come back to it after a period of time, I know what page I'm working on.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Otto, for your helpful summary. I've been using AF for only two weeks and having a great experience: it is both simple and effective. The only things which were a bit unclear to me were when to move on to the next page, and when to dismiss an item.<br><br>Your summary prompted me to reread the Quick Start. Somehow I had mentally combined steps 5 and 7, in which case one might dismiss items before ever moving on to another page. Now I understand!<br><br>Since this topic has come up several times in the Forum, Mark might add an explicit summary such as yours when AF comes out of beta. It's not because the Quick Start is unclear, but because a restatement provides a slightly different perspective on the process; we see some things from one angle, and other things from another angle.</div>

<div class="content">@Otto:  Your description of the dismissal process does not seem correct to me.<br><br>Dismissing happens like this.  You just finished working a page, so you go to the next active page.  You do Quickstart Step 1 -- quickly read through all the items on the page.  You then do Quickstart Step 2 -- Go through each item looking for one to stand out.  If NOTHING stands out, and you go through the whole page top to bottom, and take no action on any of them, then you dismiss all the remaining items on the page  -- Quickstart Step 7.  <br><br>However, if during Quickstart Step 2, you actually do take action on one or more items, then that page is no longer subject to dismissal at this time.  <br><br>The last active page is not subject to dismissal.<br><br>Does that clarify it?</div>

<div class="content">My understanding is that the dismissal step applies _whenever_ no item stands out during step 2 -- whether it occurs on the very next page or on a return through the entire list. So both Otto (reply 4) and Seraphim (reply 7) are correct. Dismissal is a general consideration which applies to any page, whenever you pass through it -- not strictly between steps 6 and 8.<br><br>If you are new to AF, then every next page is fresh, and "dismissable" items very likely will not be encountered until you recycle through the entire list, as Otto describes. At that point Seraphim's description takes effect.<br><br>I suspect this debate is caused by the intrusive location of step 7 in the Quick Steps. A possible solution is to reverse steps 7 and 8, as proposed in <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/693330." rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/693330.</a></div>

<div class="content">Scott,<br><br>Mark writes, "If you go to a page and no item stands out for you on your first pass through it, then all the outstanding items on that page are dismissed without re-entering them. Use your highlighter to mark dismissed items."<br><br>You only dismiss items on your first pass through the page.</div>

<div class="content">Chris,<br><br>Thanks for the clarification -- I agree with you. If you insert "first pass" at appropriate places, I think my comment is still valid. For a simpler and perhaps clearer statement of the issue, see my post <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/693330" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/693330</a> , where the condition of "first" is emphasized by italics.</div>

<div class="content">Chris,<br><br>I should have added that your point about "first" pass is an important distinction. Right -- not just any time we go through a page with no stand-out items. Thanks!</div>

<div class="meta">2009-03-13 3:11</div>
<div class="content">My take on this is that I won't count something as a first pass unless I have made it to the end of the notebook and have started over on the first page with active tasks.  But even here I am unsure.  Maybe the first pass should count only if it is the first time I have looked at that page that day.  I am not sure.  I have not had to dismiss many items.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-03-13 4:16</div>
<div class="content">Good point, Chris. I think it is implied that one has been over the page previously, progressed on from there to the end of the list, and now coming back to it. If upon this revisit nothing stands out, then any remaining item is dismissed. Otherwise it would be a first ever visit and somehow _none_ of the 25 to 40 active items sparks an interest -- rather hard to imagine.<br><br>In either case, the purpose and result of AF is the same: dismiss anything that doesn't interest you any more. Whether it is one item remaining or an entire page, they don't qualify to remain active.</div>

<div class="content">Scott, Seraphim and all who replied to my query, thank you very much for your responses. The problem that I had to resolve was the definition of "first" coming to a page. It's a practical issue that I face when a page is “work in progress” at the end of a day.<br><br>For example, say I’m working on the tasks on a page. If I run out of time today, I would then start my AF task review-execution from that same page the following day. As commented above, in this case it’s advisable to start the AF task review-execution procedure from the top of that unfinished page. Thus my question is: Would my second day’s review of the page be considered a “first” coming to that page?<br><br>If I may answer my own question, I would say that it should not be considered a first coming to the page. I justify this answer by saying that I only had to stop working on the page the day before because I simply ran out of time. I would consider first coming to a page if I had left it behind and moved on to the next page, no matter how many days I may have been working on it, and then later returned to it.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Otto<br><br>I consider the coming back to the same page after a break as part of the same visit, even if that "visit" is spread over a couple of days.  Provided I have actioned at least one item on that entire visit then I just move on as normal.  Your last sentence "I would consider first coming to a page if I had left it behind and moved on to the next page, no matter how many days I may have been working on it, and then later returned to it. " Is spot on.</div>

<div class="content">You lot have even got me confused!<br><br>The idea is that any time you visit a page and don't do any items on it, then all the items on it are dismissed. In other words you have to do at least one item every time you visit a page. This applies at any stage - the only exception being the last page while it still has emply lines on it.<br><br>As for coming back to the list after breaking for the night, I strongly recommend starting from where you left off, i.e. not just the page on which you stopped but also the item on which you stopped - just as if the break had never happened.</div>

<div class="content">This is a another thank you for Mark. I'm changing my copy of step 7 from "on your first pass through it" to "on your slow pass through it" echoing step 2 "go through the page more slowly"</div>
