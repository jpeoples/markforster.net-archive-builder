<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>     Can you elaborate on keeping separate notebooks for each location (you mention this in the DOs and DON'Ts section.  I like the idea of keeping work/home tasks separate, but quite often I think of a dozen things I need to do at home over the course of a day at work.  Should I be carrying all the notebooks around with me?  Any other tips for keeping the locations physically/mentally separate?  Thanks!</div>

<div class="content">I'm interested in questions re the separation of home and work, too.  Given that I sometimes work at home and sometimes do personal stuff while at the office  -- since the availability of phone/email/web in both places blurs the separation -- I'm wondering if I could just keep everything in one book.  And, if so, whether the book should have two sections or simply intermingle all the tasks.</div>

<div class="content">Jordan and Catherine:<br><br>I guess the answer is whatever you find works best for you.<br><br>If you get ideas about things to do at Home while in the Office, why not do what you would do if you were instructing another person, i.e. email yourself about them? Or if that's not allowed, have a separate page at the back of your Office book which you can then transfer into your Home book.</div>

<div class="content">I'm going to try using one single book (since this is a beta test).  I have some non-office tasks that I do over my lunch hour, so I think one book will work better for me.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-01-6 0:31</div>
<div class="content">Ahhh - now I see.  If I combine home and office items then there are items that can ONLY be done at home that I could not complete from the office.  That would leave pages with "not-compleateable" items, messing up the autofocus system.<br><br>I still want one notebook, so I think I'll flip my notebook upside down and work from the opposite end on 'home-only' items.</div>

<div class="content">Or get a Circa notebook from Levenger.  I love mine because you can add and remove pages as needed so it' doesn't get too bulky.  So I just have a home and an office tab and can carry one notebook.<br><br>If I want to, while at work, I can do a quick run through the home section.  Without having to turn it over :)</div>

<div class="meta">2009-01-6 9:15</div>
<div class="content">Zane:<br><br>That is a sensible solution, but also bear in mind that because of the nature of Autofocus items can usually remain on a page for quite a number of days before being dismissed.</div>

<div class="content">I suppose you could buy a decent, thick pad and tape a marker tap to the top of it to differentiate home and work? But it may be difficult to judge the rate of running out of space in each section...just a thought. Maybe working backwards for the home section would make it easier to adjust the tap...I'm thinking as I type now!</div>

<div class="content">Sorry, it should be tab, not tap.</div>

<div class="content">I also faced this yesterday, for example something I wanted to talk to my wife about, which could happen if she called, or when I got home.<br><br>I did the same as Zane - flipped my notebook over and worked from the back using a Home list. Then if I choose or want to do Home tasks when at work, or vice versa, it's all in one place and easy to do.</div>
<h2>Reply by Matt Gregory</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-01-6 14:24</div>
<div class="content">I ran into the same problem as Zane in trying to stick to one notebook. I've long carried one book between home and work as I find it easier than tracking two. <br>I started the Autofocus list in the back of the book, combining both home and work. I've found I'm distracted as I scan because I'm worrying that I may scan a page while at work and have nothing leap out to do, but I can't dismiss the page because it has home items on it.<br>So, what I have started to do is head a new page with the context, @Home, @Work or @Outandabout. As I get a new item to write on the bottom of the list I add it to the next context-relevant page. Early days but I hope this will provide the necessary separation without the annoyance of two books.<br><br>Matt</div>

<div class="meta">2009-01-6 16:12</div>
<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>Matt touched on what I am struggling with.  GTD gave set us up with contexts - that is to do items showing up only when you are actually in a place where you can actually do them.  I really like contextual to do lists, but I don't see how they would fit into yourAutofocus system.  <br><br>I.e.  I have items on the first page of my list that I can only do while I'm at my storage unit.  I may not go there for another week or 10 days.  What should I do with those items?  Do I have to scan though all my pages to try to find items depending on where I am at that point in time? My work is on the road all day long, so I am rarely in one place (context) for very long and may only visit certain sites once a week.<br><br>Any insight would be appreciated.<br><br>Strathy</div>

<div class="meta">2009-01-6 16:32</div>
<div class="content">Strathy<br><br>You could write a shortcut e.g. SU to the left hand side column regarding items to do while at the storage unit - then it is just a matter of scanning quickly and doing those items. I have tried this - it seems to work, for example:<br><br>ST = Stationery - items i need to get at the store<br>FL = Follow up items<br>E = Email<br>PH = Photocopying jobs etc etc</div>
<h2>Reply by Hannah</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-01-6 16:43</div>
<div class="content">Hi Strathy<br><br>Had you thought of colour coding?<br><br>If you just throw everything at Autofocus as Mark suggests, then use a pack of assorted highlighters to put a coloured dot next to any task that fits a particular context (highlighters wouldn't cover up what you'd written but you could use felt tips or whatever) then it would be much quicker to pick out all those tasks that were related to a particular location.<br><br>Other than that I think you could still run Autofocus exactly as per instructions but each time you ran through a page with a task you couldn't do yet because you weren't in the right place then it wouldn't 'stand out' for you. I have a similar situation with some of my tasks that can't be done until a particular event has happened first so I just ignore them until it has.<br><br>Good luck</div>

<div class="meta">2009-01-6 16:54</div>
<div class="content">I'm still struggling with the home v work aspect of the system (as well as my awful procrastination). I started with one generic list containing both work and home items. It seemed sensible because I can do a number of work tasks (but not all) at home. Then while scanning the list I found I was:<br>a. getting distracted by the work-based tasks that I couldn't do (because I was at home)<br>b. procrastinating the work tasks that I could be doing, in favour of (easier) home tasks<br><br>I now have three lists by context (work, home and errands) and that hasn't improved matters as I am sitting at my home computer,unclear as to whether I should be in work mode or home mode at this point in time. I'm thinking of going back to having one basic list with shortcuts on the left, as Nick suggests. <br><br>Having made little progress with the system over the past two days, I think I am a lost cause!<br><br>-Linda</div>

<div class="meta">2009-01-6 17:36</div>
<div class="content">Another problem with keeping a single list for home/office tasks is this:  Let's say you are at work and then widdle your first page down to a set of 5 things that you need to do at home.  If you later scan through this page and can't address any of the home items, wouldn't the autofocus system say that these tasks should be dismissed?  Am I misunderstanding something?<br><br>I also second Linda's comments about procrastinating at work by doing "home" tasks.<br><br>Thanks!</div>

<div class="meta">2009-01-6 17:58</div>
<div class="content">Strathy:<br><br>My recommendation in the instructions is that you keep a separate list for each location. So in the example you gave you would have a separate list for your storage unit.</div>
<h2>Reply by Mark Forster</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-01-6 18:02</div>
<div class="content">Linda:<br><br>Again my answer is to follow the instructions by keeping a separate list for each location. So on your Home list you would have your domestic chores and personal tasks plus those items of work which you want or need to do at home.<br><br>For your workplace list you would obviously enter your work tasks, plus any personal tasks that you want or need to do in your workplace (such as phone the bank, etc.)</div>

<div class="content">Message for Lena:<br><br>Please can I ask where you got your Levenger Circa Notebooks from? I thought they were virtually impossible to get in the UK. A notebook where pages can be added and taken away and dividers and tabs added would be absolutely great. Does anyone have any ideas on this one? Actually I need to be posting this on the notebook thread.......</div>

<div class="meta">2009-01-7 2:33</div>
<div class="content">I don't have this "home" vs. "work" thing figured out to my satisfaction yet, but I noticed that as I started writing my list at work yesterday, when I thought of "home" (or perhaps more accuragely stated, "personal") things, I didn't want them cluttering my work task list.  I was afraid that it would be distracting.  So my temporary--and exploratory--solution was to put the "home/personal" tasks on the left-hand page of my open notebook and my "work" tasks on the right-hand page.  Seems to work so far.  I work mostly from the right-hand page, but the left side is available for capturing personal things--books recommended or a new style of shoe to check into plus tasks like scheduling a doctor's appointment, registering my new TV, etc.  I spend most of my time at work where I'm actually handling things.  Don't know yet what's it'll be like if I actually list tasks like "do washing," or "pay bills."  Will I find I need a separate notebook at my home location?  Mostly these "home location" tasks just get done without being on a list.  Another thing: I didn't want to carry around two notebooks.  So what I really have in one notebook is personal tasks and work tasks that I am most likely to do at work.  And I don't yet have a notebook at home--and might not ever have one there.  We'll see. . .<br><br>I'm not yet giving up my GTD system.  I intend to list those recommended books and movies in my @Someday/Maybe:Movies to see and @Someday/Maybe:Books to Get lists.  Wouldn't know where to keep them with the Autofocus system.</div>
<h2>Reply by Frank</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-01-7 12:12</div>
<div class="content">Marlyn,<br><br>I don't see any problem with continuing to use aspects of GTD that are not covered by AutoFocus. That's what I'm happily doing.<br><br>Personally I don't keep "Movies to see" and "Books to get" in my Someday/Maybe list because they feel more like lists of options rather than lists of deferred actions. So I keep them among my generic GTD Checklists in a separate electronic-based project folder to AutoFocus and will continue to do so.<br><br>I consider checklist items as reference material, not actionable items, and therefore I would not enter them into AutoFocus.</div>

<div class="content">Shelley,<br><br>As I mentioned on the notebook thread, I'm using notebooks similar to Circa that are sold by WH Smiths.  It's a fairly new line, and they do them in A4, A5 and A6 sizes.  There are no refills, so I've just bought several of the books, as they're fairly cheap.    <br><br>The quality isn't as good as the ADOC books though, because the pages don't seem to turn quite as smoothly (I think the discs aren't as smooth as they should be).  Rymans sell ADOC books.  The trouble for me is that their sizes aren't right - I want something like A5, and their closest equivalent is too wide for my purposes.<br><br>I was looking on the Levenger website yesterday to see if I could buy Circa notebooks from the US, but their shipping costs are astronomical - I put one notebook with refill in my shopping basket and it estimated the postage at $80!!<br></div>

<div class="content">I went out and bought 3 thin binders. One I use for general life and my consulting business, one I use for my steady job and one I use for my work as a theater artist. I found it was too crazy to use the same book.<br><br>I am on day 3 (New York) and monday I got an enormous amount done on my consulting business and yesterday I tried it at the office of my job and both I and my boss were surprised by how much stuff I plowed through (I kept my work with Autofocus a secret) and today I will be working with all 3 books though I am a bit nervous because my toddler was throwing up all night with a nasty stomach bug and we have an ice storm up here so I am tired and unfocused and don't want to do a thing. Today will be the REAL test for me and this system!</div>

<div class="content">I've been doing @HOME and @WORK at the top of each page and so far (two days in) it seems to be working BUT...<br><br>It's the tasks that can be done from either place that are stumping me. For example, I need to call my financial advisor and ask him to liquidate my net worth so I can buy an apple and a crust of bread for lunch today. That call can be made from home or from work. Ditto for certain other tasks like catching up on certain reading, reviewing a report written by someone else, etc.<br><br>My solution so far has been to enter the tasks in BOTH lists, but that doubles the effort. Any ideas how to deal with this?</div>

<div class="content">Stever, I have found that entering the task in the book/list that relates to the location in which i will be doing it works best for me as otherwise I get distracted by Work things when doing Home and Home things which need doing when in Work (if you see what I mean...) Basically, as an example i will be in my office in London tomorrow and so and Home/Personal related items which I can sneak in to do whilst @Work I am including in my @Work book/list and thus i should not be distracted by the fact that I have a small mountain of laundry which needs doing and lightbulbs that need to be replaced whilst I am not in a position to do anything about them etc., (which if i were to scan my @Home list I would be). <br><br>As I know these things are on my @Home list I do not need to worry about them whilst in the office, although clearly as I trip over the pile when i get home I shall also be alerted to it!<br><br>Hope this helps as an option.</div>

<div class="content">I am currently having precisely the same issue as Stever.  I agree with titch that there are some tasks that belong at home and some that belong at work.  However, there are certainly some tasks that can be done in either with equal appropriateness.  For example, I like to exercise every day.  I can do that either at home or at work, and they are sort of equally likely depending on the day.  There are other similar tasks.  I don't like the idea of having multiple lists.<br><br>Stever -- are your @HOME and @WORK lists in the same notebook?<br><br>Thanks.</div>
<h2>Reply by Mark Forster</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-01-7 19:23</div>
<div class="content">As you know I recommend a separate list for each location. So at work, your list would include  private or domestic items which you need to do at your workplace. Similarly your home list would include work items which you need to do at home. But I wouldn't include a home item on the work list just because I *could* do it at my workplace, only if I need to do it there.<br><br>In Jordan's example of exercise, the answer is easy. You just put the item on both lists, and re-enter it on a list whenever you do it at that location. If you've done your exercise at work, your brain is presumably capable of remembering when you get home that you have already exercised!</div>

<div class="content">Jordan: I keep both lists in the same notebook, so I can scan my @Home list when I'm at work and vice versa.<br><br>Mark: You seem to be confirming my current strategy, which is to list items in both lists when they are to be done at one or the other in a given day. (I'm not including items that *could* be done at either, only items that *must* be done soon, but location is irrelevant.)</div>

<div class="content">This is one of the areas where software beats paper. I'm using a Mac application called TaskPaper, where it's a cinch to tag a task with both @Home and @Office so it shows up whenever I filter by either context.</div>

<div class="content">@Shelly - I'm so sorry, I didn't catch that you had asked me about my circa notebook until just now.  I'm in the states so I ordered from Levenger directly.  But it seems there has to be something comparable there.  Or maybe in Germany.  They have awesome office supplies.</div>

<div class="content">I use an electronic list with the home tasks tagged "home". I do the list filtered in either "home" or "work" mode and every new task will automatically be tagged appropriately. When I come to the item in the list, if it stands out I will reset the tag.</div>
