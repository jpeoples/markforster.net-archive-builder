<div class="content">Has anyone tried Wunderlist? What do you think?  It's free, easy to use and syncs with web/iPad/iPhone.<br><br>I haven't decided on my system yet (digital or pen and paper) but thought it was worth trying this - I always have my phone with me anyway so it seems to fit in with the spirit of decluttering that I am trying to implement! It would be quite refreshing to remove the plethora of filofaxes/notepads/binders that have taken up residence on my desk!<br><br>Also I'm thinking it might fit in with Marks philosophy (as I understand it) which is to keep things clean and simple.  Not sure if it would fit in with the 'final version', but a digital option would pull in more interest.<br><br>Anyway - as ever your thoughts would be most interesting!</div>

<div class="content">Plethora? Why did you need more than one book one pen?</div>

<div class="content">Alison,<br><br>Please see my reply to your question regarding 'Notebooks for AF/SF'. It seems a more appropriate response to this post. Simple, uncluttered, digital, and always available</div>

<div class="content">I tried Wunderlist for a short while. It's been long enough that I can't remember /why/ it didn't work for me, only that it wasn't good enough for how I do things.</div>

<div class="content">I also tried WL the software is fine but I let it down because project were complicated to follow. Omnifocus or Monkey or Toodledoo were much better. I don't use any of them now.  because paper is much better !</div>

<div class="content">It depends on what are your requirements/expectations. Why I could not use Wunderlist: you cannot move tasks in the list (fixed order), you cannot tag them (which is now available in Wunderkit - I looked at their beta, tagging is supported) and basically what you get is - plain lists. If it is what you want, then WL is OK. I was also disappointed with iPhone app (performance issues) and graphics. Do not forget to try also Toodledoo (better iP app, but terrible web design) or Remember-the-milk (clean design, but no task ordering either). Nevertheless, all these tools incl. WL are sufficient for autofocus.</div>

<div class="content">Update: Actually, you can move tasks across the list, sorry for confusion. It was some time I tried WL and I probably mistook it for some other app. Never rely on your memory, always write it down :-)</div>

<div class="content">Alison, I also dabbled  with Wunderlist, then dropped it.<br><br>I've been using Toodledo on Toshiba notebook and synced to my Android smartphone with UltimateTo Do List.<br><br>I actually find the latter easier and more powerful than the desktop Toodledo, but I am still getting used to it and find it the best of the many digital solutions I have tried.<br><br>However, I still carry a Moleskine pocketbook and will do so until I get a future smartphone that enables handwritten notes, like the Galaxy Note, but my current smartphone is only 9 months old, so i must wait.</div>

<div class="content">I've been using Wunderlist as a type of electronic tickler file for several weeks and it works well for me. Previously using Google Calendar but found that rather "cluttered".<br><br>Everything that I put on Wunderlist has a future date. Every morning I can look at what tasks are scheduled for that day, next day and the coming week.<br><br>Anything that is not time dependent goes on my Autofocus list, and is sometimes then ignored until it becomes time dependent and then goes on wunderlist.....</div>

<div class="content">I have tried Wunderkit and it seems to fit my needs for the FV i.e.<br>allow me to "tag" as well as to reorder manually.</div>

<div class="content">I tried Wunderlist for FV then it fit quite well. I still continue tu use it.<br>But if I find better I will switch.<br><br>I need to access the list from PC/MAC/iPhone and wunderlist does this rather well (could be better at sync though, there are some accidental glitches). When you star an item it is ordred perfectly for FV so for the moment it may be the no-brainer electronic implementation for FV.</div>

<div class="content">Try Evernote, multi-platform, free.<br><br>There are already plenty of posts on using it for FV, and Mark F uses it as well!</div>

<div class="content">The evernote client is buggy and crashy, has also syncing problem on mobile devices. This is the reason I stopped using evernote until they make a lighter and working(in the long run) app.</div>

<div class="content">isd:<br><br>I don't have any problem with Evernote for PC which is very fast and reliable, though I find Evernote on the Web far too slow to use. The only synching I do is between my desktop and my laptop and that is brilliant.<br><br>My laptop packed up when I arrived in Australia and I had to buy a new one. I just downloaded Evernote for PC and everything I had on Evernote was downloaded automatically onto it.<br><br>As far as using Evernote for FV goes, I'm finding it much faster than paper and pen and it has a lot of other advantages as well.</div>
