<div class="content">Anyone else facing this: I've got several big projects on my list: paint the living room, finish building shop in basement--things like that. Each project really needs a full day commitment, even by the "little and often" maxim--a day counts as a little on something like this. The main point is, I can't decide work on it for five minutes or and hour then move on to the next AF task--there's just too much set-up and take-down.<br><br>So my question is, how to do? If I've got, say, six big, multi-projects, as well as my usual AF tasks, how would you go about selecting what for when?<br><br>Is this an appropriate use of AF, or am I using the wrong tool for the job? <br><br>Thanks!</div>

<div class="content">Hi ds,<br>I've got quite a few reno projects to do and have chosen 2 rooms to work on right now.  Ordinarily, I would only work on one at a time, but my son is helping lay hardwood floor in the spare room.  I do find that I have been able to do quite a bit working in a "little and often" manner during the week for jobs like painting.  Example tasks would include:<br>- pulling off electric outlet plates<br>- taping off casings / baseboards<br>- filling any holes with primer<br>- sanding holes<br>- wash the walls<br>- painting along the edges<br><br>What I've done with the actual big painting jobs is get one of those huge freezer style of bags and put the whole paint tray plus roller in and get the air out.  This keeps the paint and roller wet and you can literally just paint a wall at a time if you want.  You can also put smaller rollers or edgers into the freezer (wrapped in a plastic bag) and they're ready to use again once they've been left out at room temperature for about 1/2 hour.  It always seems like the prep work takes 75% of the time to actually do the job.<br><br>How I've timed my renos has been based on weather and whim for the most part.   And I've done it all using AF, so it is possible.<br></div>

<div class="content">I have tried a couple approaches:<br><br>(1) Schedule one or two of them onto the calendar.  This usually doesn't work well for me -- we end up doing some project other than what we put down on the calendar.  But every now and then it works just fine, especially if there's a hard deadline.<br><br>(2) Keep a separate list of such projects (I call it my "Saturday" list).  Usually this list is referenced in AF (e.g., "Review Saturday list" or "Anything to add to Saturday list?" or "New chicken coop -- add to Saturday list!").    Then, when it looks like we actually have a free Saturday coming soon, my wife and I look over the list and decide what needs to be done.  Whichever project "feels ready to be done" is the one we do.<br><br>Neither option works well unless you've got your ducks lined up.  E.g., "paint the goat barn" doesn't work too well if you still haven't bought any paint.  So I try to make sure those prerequisite tasks go onto AF well ahead of time.  That's one reason the "Review Saturday tasks" is on the AF list -- to check for prerequisites that haven't been completed yet.</div>

<div class="content">DS,.<br><br>For big projects with setup and take down, I find that blocking time is a necessity.  When I was working on building a couple of decks, I'd decide that the morning was the best time (cooler) and certain days were better (my wife was not teaching band camp), for example.  So I'd block 4 hours, set up the tools, go to work, and leave 15 minutes to put stuff away.  Little and often, in this case, became 4 hours and often.<br><br>As Seraphim, said, be sure to get the prerequisites done or you'll lose valuable time running errands when you want to be doing.<br><br>I also found that cluttering the list with details was not smart.  I kept a "Deck Project" page with all of the tasks on it and just put: "Work on Deck" on the AF list.  That would tell me to schedule time to do it.  The blocking of time was on my calendar.  That's just how I work big projects and it seems to work well for me.</div>
