<div class="content">Reflecting on Seraphim's observation that's Mark's FV list lacks trivia which are dropped, I don't know what Mark's scheme is, but for myself I'm thinking:<br><br>1. Only enter tasks I am _committed_ to achieving.  (To do this, I will need to decide in what I'm committed to, first at a high level, and then in more specifically.)<br>2. If I need to decide whether to commit, enter as a question.<br><br>The main benefit of this should be focus to do the committed things excellently.</div>

<div class="content">This works in the short-term, but not in the long-term. When things are busy, less important things get dropped. The system needs to keep hold of them and remind you of them sometimes.<br><br>Some things that you're committed to do in the long run have earlier deadlines. If I have a busy week, I might delete everything to do with music lessons. If the busy time unexpectedly extends another week, I might miss the application deadline for the exam -- even though there will be enough free time between now and the exam to prepare, just not this month.</div>

<div class="content">+JMJ+<br><br>@Alan: I don't think so.  I think Mark is using a different way of selecting which tasks to do from \"standing out\", which leaves \"trivial things\" out in the list languishing, and then his subconscious picks that up and he then stops adding \"trivial things\" out of habit.</div>
