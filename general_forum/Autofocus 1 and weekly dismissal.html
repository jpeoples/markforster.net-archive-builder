<div class="content">Shortly before the Lenten Challenge begun, I started my current stint with Autofocus 1.<br><br>The review of dismissed tasks for re-entry or final deletion, I scheduled once per week.<br><br>This had a subtle effect on dismissal. I learned that I rather finish or delete something, if I have to re-visit it next week anyway. So, the weekly time frame for review was just too short.<br><br>I changed it to a monthly review, that works better.</div>

But isn't taking decisive action like this what you want?<br><br>Or am I misunderstanding you?</div>

<div class="content">Mark Forster:<br><br>Not misunderstanding me as far as I can tell.<br><br>The weekly review puts a soft pressure on tasks that helps to come to terms with those "dingbats" entries. But even faster than coming to terms is to just dismiss the lot and then letting them disapear in the vortex of time.<br><br>It's a little bit like Seraphim's Serial No List, just write it down, just don't do anything about it, let it go.<br><br>The point is, while it is nice to have completed the dingbats, it also takes time and energy better spend elsewhere.</div>

<div class="content">Christopher:<br><br>Still not quite sure I've got your meaning.<br><br>In your first post in this thread you talked about having a monthly review.<br><br>And now you're talking about just dismissing the lot and then letting them disappear in the vortex of time.<br><br>There's indeed a lot to be said for just letting them disappear.</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br>What I meant to say, the monthly review provides a long time span between dismissal and review time. By that time it is much clearer which tasks I should let go for good.<br><br>With the weekly review, all tasks still tend to be fresh enough for consumation, so to speak. <br><br>Sorry for not being more clear.</div>
