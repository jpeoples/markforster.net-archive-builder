<div class="content">I'll start: <br><br>"You don't need a new plan for next year. You need a commitment."<br><br>For about a year, I had "open new office" on various lists (AF, DWM, GTD). No actions were taken. However things changed when I found out the building (where my office is in) is going to be torn down, and replaced with condos. Within two months, I signed a 2 year lease for a fantastic office. My signature spurred more action (purchasing a carpet, couches, etc), all without lists, contexts, etc. <br><br>And yet I keep lists. Perhaps I should make more commitments.</div>

<div class="content">AF is a list of things you might commit to. The biggest question is which to pick, and to be sure to pick the best.</div>

<div class="content"><<Doing something because you have to isn't a commitment. >><br><br>We'll have to agree to disagree. I can think of a plethora of things, with various consequences, that "I must do". I can also think of many ways to procrastinate on those things (one of my favorites is discussing productivity tools and tips). <br><br>Although Seth is mocking me, I agree with his observation.</div>

Further, his claim that:<br><br>"... once you do make the commitment, the productivity tips aren't that needed."<br><br>seems to support most of my past accomplishments.</div>

<div class="content">So figure what you WILL TO DO and focus on that as much as possible. All other tasks you do when they must be done, as they become urgent. This is more effective than stuffing everything into a System and not having a particular commitment - regardless of the system. I think that's what he's saying.</div>

But what has that got to do with making a commitment?<br><br>You went from "I must get round to opening a new office sometime" to "I have to open a new office before the building is knocked down around my ears" simply through force of circumstances.</div>

<div class="content">Mark: I suppose committment comes AFTER something "stands out"? Or perhaps they are the tasks we ARE ready to commit to?</div>

<div class="content">Being a bit of a devil's advocate here:<br>But does it *really* need to be done?  If it does you will know and do it. There are many pseudo-needs that if ignored will simply go away. And once you so that, the list of needs is small enough it doesn't need much management. in any event, missing a couple 'needs' is less significant than missing a major 'opportunity'.</div>

<div class="content">There seems to be a lot of talk recently on not making commitments, not having goals, and so on. It's sort of a new fashionable take on productivity and it makes me very nervous. This is mainly because in my observation of others, those who have a goal and make plans to achieve that goal get things done and get their life the way they want it to be.  This inevitably leads to lists of tasks that need to be done and managed which of course is where time management and personal organisation comes in.<br><br>I've also observed that there doesn't seem to be one-size-fits-all to this. It's a question of finding or adapting a system to work for you based on some sound principles. We all look to Mark for the sound principles.<br><br>I suspect that others, like me, are looking for that secret golden gem of an idea that will magically transform us all into perfect organisation. Well, I for one don't think it exists (although I keep an eye out for it!), but managing ourselves and our tasks is probably just a question of following methodology that suits us consistently and diligently.  And in my view this is the hard bit.<br><br>Some people are born naturally organised and others have to work at it - I suspect that all of us that frequent this forum are of the latter group.<br><br>Just a few of my thoughts!</div>

<div class="content">Alison,<br><br><<Some people are born naturally organised and others have to work at it>><br><br>I'm not sure that is true. I think everyone has to work at it. Perhaps it is more to do with upbringing and how organized your parents are. Nurture not nature. Perhaps those who *seem* naturally, inately, organized are more goal orientated -- they are people who have to be organized to some degree so that they can actually work towards their goals.<br><br>Goals are something to be aimed at. Once the goal is achieved, it is an achievement, not a goal.<br><br>I have never been particularly goal orientated, and until I was introduced to the marvelous AF1 I spent most of my time wondering what to do. So now I am more goal orientated, and I am committed to the goals, as a result of having a task management system that works.</div>

<div class="content">Alison:<br><br><< Some people are born naturally organised and others have to work at it >><br><br>I think this is very true (I'm married to one of the naturally organised ones!)<br><br>But I think nevertheless that even the naturally organized ones use some form of system. They don't just wait for inspiration to strike. We can therefore learn from them and model them.</div>

<div class="content">Mark - very true. I know one or two naturally organised people (who seem reluctant to 'share' their secret!) and they just look at me in amazement when I question them, because what they do just seems to come naturally to them and they don't think about it. However it usually involves writing things down in some form of list.<br><br>I also know people who are naturally organised but who don't set goals, so they don't always go hand in hand.</div>

<div class="content">Mark, avrum,<br><br>In avrum's example, the office move became a key part of an existing commitment, which was to stay in business. That seem's fair enough to me.<br><br>Doing something when you feel like doing it seems to fit in well with AF as well. (I realise that "when I feel like" is not quite the same as "when it stands out") .</div>

<div class="meta">2012-01-3 14:08</div>
<div class="content">Will:<br><br>I think you are missing the point of the exchange. Avrum was giving the office move as an example of how he got moving on something once he'd made a new commitment to it. I pointed out that he actually hadn't made a new commitment - the driving force had been force of circumstances.<br><br>You're also missing the point of AF, which is to get you to do things you don't feel like doing, as well as those you do!</div>

<div class="meta">2012-01-3 16:38</div>
<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>Sigh, so many missed points...<br><br>I think I agree with both of you. What I was trying to say, in my stumbling and incoherent way, was that the change in circumstances would have no force if it wasn't linked to a real commitment.<br><br>Ah, now I see where I've been going wrong all these years... :0)<br><br>Seriously, I'm sure Seth Godin does a lot of stuff he would prefer not to have to do. But the idea of choosing based on a sort of flow rather than crude rules seems to me to be very much in the spirit of AF.</div>
