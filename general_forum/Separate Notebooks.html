<div class="content">I just joined the AutoFocus beta a couple of days ago, and it makes a good amount of sense to me overall. One point that seemed problematic (for me, at least) was the requirement for "separate notebooks for separate places, like Home and Workplace", however...<br><br>My job is such that I'm traveling from half to two-thirds of the time, and when I'm not, I can--more often than not--do most of my work from home, convenient, since it's a 37-mile drive to my actual office.<br><br>I also don't tend to make a very strong distinction between "work stuff" and "home stuff". I'll work for a few hours during the day, go out and run some personal errands, come back,, watch a movie, do a few more hours work in the evening, etc. I tend, overall, to intersperse "Workplace" activities from "Home" activities; moreover, what puts me in the "Workplace" as opposed to "Home" is simply what I'm working _on_ at the moment.<br><br>Given all of that, it seems more sensible for me to maintain a single Autofocus notebook. What do you think?</div>

<div class="content">Lefty<br><br>I absolutely agree that a single notebook is a great solution - it has been working really well for me since day 1.  There are a couple of threads on this in the FAQ post - link below<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/645945" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/645945</a><br></div>

<div class="content">Lefty,<br><br>I'm in much the same situation, but I try (not always successfully!) to keep work and personal items separate in order to focus on the one or the other at any given time. i started using AF in manual mode, and used the front of the notebook for Office/Work, turned the book upside down and started Personal from the other end. It separates the tasks physically, but enables one notebook. <br><br>I'm now using ListPro for AF and it's working well for me with separate files. However, I transfer ERRANDS and CHORES entered in either the Office/Work or the Personal list and group them together so I can batch them and do a mixture when I go out. <br><br>The best advice I can give to a newcomer to AF is to try it as per Mark F recommends, see how it works, then tweak it until you have a Lefty-friendly model. With AF I have found my productivity and energy levels rising and my procrastination propensity falling, but not eliminated. What is important is what works for YOU, not for Roger J, Christine B or even Mark F. But reread Mark's instructions every now and then, and the comments from him and the other testers, some real gems to be found. <br><br></div>

<div class="content">Echoing what Roger says, I'd recommend trying it both ways for a week and see what works best.  I found the mixed list works better when you can use your discretion to choose when to work and when to do personal stuff.  The separated lists work better when there are distinct blocks of time dedicated to work, and distinct blocks for personal.<br><br>To try it both ways, here is what I did.  I was already using a mixed list for a few weeks.  It was probably 60% personal, 40% work.  So, I kept it as my personal book, and started a separate book for work.  I immediately jotted down the first work items that popped into my head.  I also added "transfer work items from personal AF book".  And then away I went.  I keep both books handy at all times, so I can write down whatever pops into my head, into the appropriate book.  But I actually work through only one book at a time.</div>

<div class="content">I think it's clear from the posts that different methods work just as well and that different situations may have a bearing.  Like Seraphim I tried changing this week by extracting home items but for me it didn't wwork.  However I think the reason it didn't work was because I was actually trying more to "buck the system" as opposed to having a situational need for two lists like Seraphim.  At present for me one list is best - I can envisage that if my circustances change two lists will be better.  I would definately echo the advice above and say try both (although that will not necessarily be easy!) and go with whatever works best "for you".</div>

<div class="content">I have experienced what Seraphim describes. <br><br>I have enjoyed much success  using a separate AF notebook for a specific writing project that gets worked on in 4 hour blocks of time each day.  Entries started off slowly and I did not think it was going to help me write; I feared it would become just another thing to fiddle with instead of  actually writing.  Contrary to my initial fears,  I have found my separate AF project notebook to be a trusted writing companion. It willingly receives and collects random tasks and new ideas and "think abouts". I don't use it to collect creative ideas as these go into another AF type open list that may be a paragraph long or just a sentence about a character note I don't want to forget.  Even on this longer list, I borrow the AF technique of reviewing these creative notes and trolling for a stand out item for the particular bit I am working on in the manuscript.  I just love the freedom I have gained knowing that everything is down on paper. I don't have to worry about where the juicy ideas and bits have been stored. What's best, I trust that the reviewing and stand out  process is keeping creative idea I could possibly need floating on the surface available to be picked up and used by both my subconscious and conscious mind.<br><br>With the separate AF project notebook I get the benefits of AF's simple collection process and I use the "stand out" to jump start my long writing sessions.  If I am feeling a bit  rebellious, I get to pick whatever item on the list I want to work on.  Being able to choose is like candy for my inner rebel.</div>

<div class="content">Stark<br><br>Your post has given me an idea with regard to my home items.  I do already use lists for my projects which I work on in a similar way.  However I do not set specific time blocks but work on them when the project task stands out, therefore letting the system create the time block by the "as long as I feel like" rule.  It strikes me that I could keep a separate list of the routine home tasks for use with a less defined "home routines" task.  That would enable the tasks to be kept firmly within the system but allow them to be actioned in a group way if that task stood out.</div>

<div class="content">I've had a lot of experience working with various systems of managing the stuff I need to do, and--while I understand the comments to "try it the way Mark suggests"--I'm pretty confident that having a second notebook will simply double the complication for me (Where's my _other_ notebook? Do I need to carry _both_ with me all the time? Which notebook do I put something in if it's, say, a local errand I need to run to pick up something I need for an upcoming business trip?) without providing any particular advantages.<br><br>I can see the separate notebooks making sense for someone whose workstyle is such that they go into the office in the morning, do their work, and then go home, at which point they're no longer working for the day.<br><br>My life's different. I flew150,000 miles last year on business, and I have interactions with colleagues in geographies all over the world--meaning I'm frequently obligated to, for example, participate in conference calls at inconvenient hours, based on where I am and where the other party happens to be. So, the way I end up working is a few hours here and a couple of hours there, interspersed with "personal time", going back and forth as I said between "work" and "home" without ever changing my current physical location particularly...</div>

<div class="content">Lefty:<br><br>The question of how many lists/notebooks to have is ultimately one that can only be answered by each individual for themselves. So your answer sounds as if it is the right one for you.</div>

<div class="content">I have one notebook but 3 sections.<br>At the front I enter my home items. From the back and in reverse order I enter my work related items. In the center I enter the errands.<br>Having 3 sections is very helpful when I need to review quickly. For example say I go back home after work, and I remember I had something to do maybe so I open the notebook in the middle and scan rapidly my errands list. There is no point in having my errands on my home or work list because they always be out of context and will be dismissed in the end.<br><br>O just pleat the corner of the start page of my errands list so I can access it easily.<br><br>My notebook is 8.5x13cm and fits in every pocket. And there is a slot for slim mechanical pencil (I could use a spiral notebook either). <br><br>Since I can't write 25 items on a single page, I consider a double page as a single AF page. I don't know why mark insists on 25 lines per page, since a smaller notebook is easier to carry, so 13x2 lines feels like the same, and more compact.</div>

<div class="content">I write my Home items in the front section on an A5 notebook.<br><br>I write my Office and Lunchtime errnads list in the second half of the notebook.<br><br>When I am at work (an office building) I can focus on what I have to do there<br>rather than my home and family activities.   I rule a narrow column on the right<br>hand side of the page and wrote a capital L for items that need to be done<br>at lunchtime.<br><br>This works for me, except yesterday I wrote some home activities on the<br>office page, so I had to write an entry on the Home list saying "Three home items<br>on the office page".<br><br>By the way, I have a lot more items on my home list than work, so running<br>two lists (Home/Work) is effective for me.<br><br>Charles<br><br></div>

<div class="content">ISD,<br><br>Mark does not "insist" on anything.  He finds that for him, 30 lines or so works best.  We have, from time to time, speculated on the effect of the number of lines per page on how well the system works.  I have a pocket 3x5 inch book which has 15 lines.  I've tried writing two items on each line (near the top and near the bottom of the line) and it is a bit hard to read, but workable.  I'm not sure which Iike best yet.<br><br>One effect of the number of lines is that it controls how many times you see a task that you are resistant to doing.  You see it at most 15 times (in a 15 line page) before you MUST do it or dismiss it ... or 30 times if your book has 30 lines per page.  Experiment and see what works best for you.</div>
