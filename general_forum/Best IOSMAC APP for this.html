<div class="content">The best App I have found for these type of systems is actually the spreadsheet. I use Apple Numbers, I think it's the best spreadsheet app out there.<br><br>Notational Velocity and nvALT are also very interesting.<br><br>I use text files and Automator scripts a lot as well.<br><br>If you really want "the" app, use Emacs Org-Mode, but that is pretty geeky, I mean you have to learn a lot to get this even running. But if you get it, it is the end-solution to all of this.</div>

<div class="content">Almost forgot: the standard Calendar and Reminders apps that come with every Mac are actually excellent for this as they are.<br><br>Maybe you like a more integrated approach, try BusyCal.</div>

<div class="content">Pocket Informant<br><br>i wouldn't say this is the best app for GTD, as there are so many and the best is what works for you<br>however Pocket Informant is one that is not often seen on app todo lists, which is odd. maybe because not the latest.<br><br>it is by far the most complete. with an enormous list of features. that is also the weakness, may totally overwhelm. with Realmac Clear as the total other end of complex to simple.<br><br>with Pocket Informant you can set it up for Franklin Covey<br>Standard (GTD®)<br>and Simple Tasks<br>( yes, has the ® in the settings menu )<br><br><a href="http://pocketinformant.com/products/pocket-informant-pro/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://pocketinformant.com/products/pocket-informant-pro/</a></div>

<div class="content">Toodledo at www.toodledo.com is an excellent web-based app with a very good iOS app. It is very customizable and can be used for any system; I've used it with all of Mark's AF and FV systems.<br><br>It's free with all its basic features and only costs extra if you want to keep your completed tasks for a while or use some extra features. The subscription is a very reasonable $15-25 a year.<br><br>I have no connection to it other than having used it and paid for it for over eight years.</div>
