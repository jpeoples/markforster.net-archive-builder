<div class="content">Norman, since we were locked out of the last thread, I thought I would respond here.<br><br>>>Believe all you want that "positive thoughts" (whatever that is) cure cancer. Just show me the peer-reviewed study which has been reproduced more than a couple dozen times.<<<br><br>Yeah, I can believe that all I want and it won't make it so, will it? ;-) The problem, of course, is in studying thinking and beliefs. Not exactly the same as chemistry. How do we measure mental processes accurately. We can't. That does not mean that our beliefs/thoughts don't affect our health. The placebo effect may be proof of that influence or proof of intermittent symptoms. Peer-reviewed studies or no, the anecdotal and experiential evidence is overwhelmingly in favor of an influence of thinking on health outcomes. And btw, you're setting the bar awfully high demanding well crafted research replicated more than 24 times! <br><br>Do you deny that it's even a factor? I'm certainly not arguing that thoughts are necessary or sufficient for recovery from cancer. IOW, you may believe you're going to die and you don't. You may believe you will recover and yet you die. But does it play a role? IMO, absolutely. Good grief, that's the case for diet and exercise considered to be vital. Ask any hospice worker if people have an influence over their deaths. How many will themselves to hang on until a special event or a loved one arrives or leaves? I'll be astonished if you don't believe it is an important factor. After reading more about chemotherapy's minimal impact on survival rates for breast cancer for example, I would argue attitude/beliefs/whatever you wanna call it are every bit as important. <br><br>So how far has my intelligence ranking fallen?</div>

<div class="content">If thinking can't cure a common cold or heal a paper cut how can it possibly cure cancer?  I have never understood the appeal of this naive belief.  It strikes me as a cruel insult to those who are sick and can't get well.</div>

<div class="content">I think I'm with Mel on this, but when my wife was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 1995 (bone marrow transplant 1 February 1996, currently one of the longest survivors from her treatment regime), we got sick and tired of the "advice" and the "labels" from various quarters including some family members.<br><br>"Take a lot of vitamins"  "Get your mind right"  "Eat this fruit."  We're all individuals and as a couple with one son still living at home (now a top notch nurse, sparked by witnessing Gill's care 15 years ago), we approached it our way and adapted as we went along.<br><br>We stopped ourselves  asking "Why" (the condition could have been triggered by Chernobyl, my own Dad - not related to Gill - had it when he died in 1994) early on and decided to focus on what we thought were the important things such as getting a better perspective on everyday life, prayer and support from true friends and close family, and trying to maintain a sense of humour, if a little dark at times.:<br><br>"Keep your hair own, Mum!" said Tim when Gill, in the middle of some pretty savage chemotherapy and bald, freaked out over some trivial thing.  Gill had two wigs then which we named "mood" wigs as we could tell her frame of mind from which one she was wearing.<br><br>It was tough, but we got through it even though the condition is not curable, yet.<br><br>One of my favourite, cynical sayings which we trot out now and then: <br><br>"Cheer up, things could be worse.  So I cheered up and sure enough, things got worse."<br><br>For anyone going through something similar, my advice is: hang in there, and deal with it your own way as best you can, when (if?) you emerge from your ordeal, chances are you will be quite a different person from the one you were before.  I say this as the life partner as well as on behalf of Gill.</div>

<div class="content">Steve: "If thinking can't cure a common cold or heal a paper cut how can it possibly cure cancer? I have never understood the appeal of this naive belief. It strikes me as a cruel insult to those who are sick and can't get well."<br><br>What if I inserted "diet" or "exercise" in your statement. Is that naive, too? I'm wondering if you read my whole post? In no way have I suggested that there is a one-to-one relationship between thinking and disease just as there isn't for diet and exercise. But to dismiss it as a powerful force is what I think is truly naive.<br><br>RogerJ, I'm sorry for what you and Gill had to go through. No matter the problem, people are quick to make assumptions and suggestions. Never would I say to someone who was sick, "Your thinking must be way off!" When I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis, I didn't enjoy hearing, "You need to learn to manage your stress better."</div>

<div class="content">Honestly, I dunno if it is worth digging all the BS out here. The fallacies are many and pernicious. <br><br>Mel, really go through each of your arguments and tell me which could not be used as examples of fallacies in a class on rhetoric.<br> <br>You can believe what you want, even that what you believe and think will significantly alter cancer, but unfortunately those beliefs will not alter reality.<br><br>The only ground I can allow is that yes something like "thoughts" have something to do with biology and thus do condition the biological organism and thus in some way must have some effect on cancer and that effect is probably so insignificant as to be immeasurable and irrelevant.<br><br>But that is a very, very weak statement. <br><br>Even the effect of diet and exercise on cancer is very small and correlative. We hardly understand anything like "diet" and know that something like moving around is some manner is better than too much or not enough, but where that line is we don't know.<br><br>The fact remain that we know almost nothing about the causes and conditions of cancer. Certainly it has almost nothing to do with what we think.<br><br>The reason we have the scientific method is so that we don't resort to the kinda thought experiments and anecdotal evidence suggested above.</div>

<div class="content">Lately I've come across a couple of things which make me wonder if my immediate post-WW2 generation and subsequent generations have forgotten that life isn't always meant to be good and fair. nor does it have to be.<br><br>The catalyst was reading "Heroes" by James Holland, a very readable account of several ordinary individuals who had their own 20s lifeplans disrupted by WW2.  I have always been a fairly keen student of matters military (my early life was spent in various parts of Britain's shrinking empire, my Dad being in the Navy.  Which one?  There is only one, he used to say, the Royal Navy).  The book set me wondering anew how my folks et al coped.  I have a renewed gratitude and appreciation for what they did.<br><br>Too many people today look for something or someone to blame, "Where there's blame, there's a claim".  The I read this from a modern lass:<br><br>Lovely quote from a DT article about an injured Oxford student who recovered at Headley court, the centre for Army casualties for rehab:<br><br>"The whole experience has made me look out into the world. I am looking forward to a good career and a great life. Headley inspired me to realise that no matter what life throws at you, you just have to get on with it."<br><br><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/7625255/Headley-Court-One-womans-remarkable-recovery-from-brain-injury.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/7625255/Headley-Court-One-womans-remarkable-recovery-from-brain-injury.html</a><br><br>I also found this which is under my Skype name this week:<br><br>In three words I can sum up everything I've learned about life: It goes on. - Robert Frost<br><br>Returning to my situation: the success of Gill's treatment was due in the main to bio-chemical engineering, but it was not the only factor.  Some witnesses tried to comfort me by saying that it's as bad for the the spouse (or parent) as well as the patient.  I used to thank them for trying to comfort me, but told them it was not like that for me.  Watching Gill go through it was awful, but SHE was the one that felt ill, vomited, cried in pain and during her transplant went to the very edge of death's dark vale.<br><br>Now to find a less sobering thread,  Never mind how many angels can dance on a pin, have you ever tried striking a match on jelly?<br><br>She came through it relatively well, others didn't and died.  Why? None of us really know why and what makes similar people differ in their destiny.  But without the engineering, I would be alone.</div>

<div class="content">RogerJ:<br><br>"She came through it relatively well, others didn't and died. Why? None of us really know why and what makes similar people differ in their destiny."<br><br>This is about the most accurate statement one can make. <br><br>Good post Roger. <br><br>When people lack an clear explanation for something, they immediately begin looking for one with whatever rudimentary and blunt objects they have at the ready.<br><br>It is hard to stand and remain open to pain and suffering without having an answer for it or trying to look for one.<br><br>Watching others suffer, it is hard not to offer the insipid, "it will be OK."<br><br>The quote you used about "getting on with it" is much in line with Constructive Living. Rather than asking why I am suffering, better to ask how I want to suffer.  <br><br>What exactly the last statement means is a story for another time.</div>

<div class="content">OY!.  Where to even begin?  My Irony Meter is so badly broken that I doubt I'll ever get it back from the shop.<br><br>Norman:  Can you still be stuck in the Reductionist Fallacy?  Apparently so.  And here I was starting to think better of you.  <tsk tsk tsk><br><br>And what do you mean that the mind can't cure cancer?  How would you know?  You seem to begin by saying that the mind does not exist.  (Or are you simply speaking for yourself?)<br><br>You said: "Believe all you want that "positive thoughts" (whatever that is) cure cancer. Just show me the peer-reviewed study which has been reproduced more than a couple dozen times."<br><br>Well, "positive thoughts" are thoughts which are "positive".  Does that help you at all?  They are thoughts about getting the result you desire rather than about the results you do NOT desire.  It is actually a pretty simple concept.  You focus thinking on being well rather than on being sick.<br><br>Next, I don't think anyone (certainly not I) said that thoughts cure cancer.  You seem to have left out the description I gave about there being multiple causes for things.  (Remember me going into germ theory for a second there?)  I'm confident that no one can say (which is not to say that they WON'T say) what cures anything.  The best minds (as I define them) agree that the body cures itself and all medicine can do is get out of its way.<br><br>Finally, what the HELL does a peer reviewed study have to do with anything?  You seem to be confusing knowledge with those who grasp it.  (I assume that by "peer reviewed" you mean reviewed by those who disagree with the idea?)   But if you like that approach, just show me one peer reviewed study that shows any miracle has ever happened.  (And here "peer reviewed" would be those who do not believe in miracles.)<br><br>Lastly (as opposed to finally) there is the whole issue of using the right tool for the job.  One does not try to determine how much something weighs by using a stop watch ... one uses a balance.  Likewise, one does not determine the effectiveness of a course of treatment by empaneling people to talk about how many milliliters of good thoughts were used simply because they evaluate chemotherapy that way.  Heresy though it may seem to be to you, the correct tool for the job is not always found in a chemistry lab.  Psychologist made that mistake a couple of centuries ago and psychology as still not recovered.  As it turns out, observation works, even if one does it while not wearing a lab coat.  And people HAVE observed the beneficial results of "positive thoughts".  They have even written at length about it.<br><br>Oh, and one last final thought: the universe is not "fair".  Disease is not "evil" -- it is part of the reality in which we live.  It is not "out to get you".  Taking it personally and getting angry with it really does not seem to help ... at least as shown by all the peer reviewed studies I've seen.</div>

<div class="content">Mel,<br><br>>>>  Norman, since we were locked out of the last thread, I thought I would respond here.  <<<<br><br>You beat me too it.  I was going to come at it differently but then it is probably better that you took up the gauntlet.  I was going to say something boorish about the Irony of Norman being the one to scream that the thread needed to be locked because he did  not like it ... after all of those who tried to shout HIM down.  But then, my Irony Meter is busted, as I said.<br><br>>>>  Yeah, I can believe that all I want and it won't make it so, will it? ;-) The problem, of course, is in studying thinking and beliefs. Not exactly the same as chemistry. How do we measure mental processes accurately. We can't. <<<<br><br>More accurately: we can't mearuse them in the same way that we measure the speed of a car or the weight of a sack of flour or the cost of a pound of coffee.  The method of measurement has to be appropriate to what is being measured.  Psychology has failed miserably in doing its job precisely because of the failure to grasp that simple idea.  It all went to hell with the behaviorists who decided that since they were to stupid or lazy to figure out the APPROPRIATE way to measure mental effects they would measure how fast rats could find cheese ... because they already knew how to measure with a stop watch.  (It is one of those find the problem to suit your solution kind of things.  Or, if your only tool is a stop watch, then the question must be: "How fast do rats run a maze?"<br><br>>>>  That does not mean that our beliefs/thoughts don't affect our health. The placebo effect may be proof of that influence or proof of intermittent symptoms.  <<<<br><br>The placebo effect is so well established that it is now used as the standard by which all drugs are measured -- by those same people who deny it exists or has any benefit.  How is that for a busted Irony Meter?  LOL ;-)<br><br>>>>  'Peer-reviewed studies or no, the anecdotal and experiential evidence is overwhelmingly in favor of an influence of thinking on health outcomes. And btw, you're setting the bar awfully high demanding well crafted research replicated more than 24 times!  <<<<br><br>Yes, not many studies meet that criterion.

I'm certainly not arguing that thoughts are necessary or sufficient for recovery from cancer. IOW, you may believe you're going to die and you don't. You may believe you will recover and yet you die. But does it play a role? IMO, absolutely. Good grief, that's the case for diet and exercise considered to be vital. Ask any hospice worker if people have an influence over their deaths. How many will themselves to hang on until a special event or a loved one arrives or leaves? <<<<br><br>All one needs to is look at the correlation between death and day of the year.  People, generally speaking, don't die before big holidays.<br><br>>>>  I'll be astonished if you don't believe it is an important factor. After reading more about chemotherapy's minimal impact on survival rates for breast cancer for example, I would argue attitude/beliefs/whatever you wanna call it are every bit as important.  <<<<br><br>I'm sure the day will come when doctors will talk about the barbaric days of chemotherapy.

It is scarcely the position of those who are more informed about this.  And speaking of logic: how can you deny something on principle then acknowledge its existence although "insignificant, immeasurable, and irrelevant".  And how the hell can something be both "immeasurable" and "irrelevant"?  In order to say that it is not relevant you first have to measure it.  See what I mean about logical fallacy?<br><br>>>>  Even the effect of diet and exercise on cancer is very small and correlative. We hardly understand anything like "diet" and know that something like moving around is some manner is better than too much or not enough, but where that line is we don't know.   <<<<br><br>And that brings us back to logical fallacy.  Not knowing WHY something works is not the same as it not WORKING.  Moreover, there is plenty of evidence that many many things have an effect and not understanding precisely what has which effect on what is not at all important to those trying to get well.  If one changes diet, exercise, thinking and also does chemo and then gets better ... how is it logical to say that the chemo did it but not the diet, exercise and positive thinking?  All you can say is that they got well (and even that is a vague statement) and they did AT LEAST these things.  Who knows what did which?<br><br>>>>  The fact remain that we know almost nothing about the causes and conditions of cancer. Certainly it has almost nothing to do with what we think.  <<<<br><br>Once again, logic.  You can't have it both ways.

If you have few options, it is crazy not to use every last one of them!  We live in wonderful times.  We can do some amazing things with our bodies.  It won't be long before cancer is "cured".  But then, the next disease will get us.  Unless one really thinks that immortality is in the cards, cancer is not the real problem.  The real problem is that we won't live forever and will die for SOME reason.<br><br>But nothing in that implies that we will go quietly into that dark night.<br><br>As to Mary Baker Eddy and her gang ...

<div class="content">Thoughts have everything to do with health and recovery. There are plenty of peer reviewed journals that support that. But you don't need peer reviewed journals, the case is pretty overwhelming in favour on the influence of thought. What gets people tripped up is the idea that we cause our own illnesses and maybe to blame. And then if we don't recover we are again to blame because we didn't do and think the right things. Both these things are incredibly unproductive types of thinking and really beside the point.<br><br>>>The only ground I can allow is that yes something like "thoughts" have something to do with biology and thus do condition the biological organism and thus in some way must have some effect on cancer and that effect is probably so insignificant as to be immeasurable and irrelevant.<<<br><br>That's like saying 'thought has something to do with these buildings outside'. Obviously they were constructed and many variables came together. Thought must have been just one of them. We're not entirely sure what the main cause of these buildings was. Was it the market demand? The buyers? The people living in it? The plumbers? The contractors? The propitious landscaping conditions? The bricklayers? The iron industry? The economic climate? The fact is we know that the entire civilized worlds can be contributed to ideas that popped up in the minds of people. It takes an initial idea to build a skyscraper. Just because we have a lot of thoughts that are seemingly insignificant doesn't mean they are insignificant. (I'm not saying that every health condition is caused by thoughts, I'm only saying that thoughts are not insignificant contrary to what Norman is saying). <br><br>The reason we should rightly be deliberate about how we think is because it's the thing we have the greatest control over. It's the only thing we really have the ability to choose. We can't pick our dna, our parents, the country we're born in etc. But we can influence the quality of our thoughts, what we have our attention on. And low and behold, at the end of the day, that's the only thing that matters. If we give up the reigns to that we render ourselves as robots at the mercy of probability and outside conditions.<br><br>The scientic method is great but its methods lead to reductionism. Every person, every situation is different. Scientists collect data to find meaningful patterns.But to take an extreme example, chaos theory tells us that we literally can't predict or determine the origin of an effect precisely. What do you think our chances are for determining that 'significant' contributor on a case level when you try to examine groups of data. All you're going to get at most is factors that seem to correlate. We can only say sensible things about the patterns we see on a group level and even on that level we're limited.</div>

<div class="content">Mike, <br><br>You misunderstand me. Of course I think you should take any and all steps to fight or ward off an illness. But changing your diet and increasing your daily exercise (to use your examples) are attempts to deal with physical / scientific reality. A person who says, "I want to get better so I will eat differently," is taking a clear action. It may or may not work but it's grounded in experience.   It's not the same as saying, "I want to get better so I will think good thoughts." <br><br>Comprende, amigo?</div>

<div class="content">My view for what it's worth is that *of course* my thoughts effect my health and indeed my very existence. The only question is how much in any particular situation. It's a continuum.<br><br>At the extremes of the continuum:<br><br>I decide to commit suicide and succeed. (Nearly 100% caused by my thoughts)<br>I get killed by a random bullet in a street shooting (Nearly 0% caused by my thoughts)<br><br>My thinking also effects other people's health:<br><br>I am Adolf Hitler and decide to invade Russia (millions of people killed by my thoughts)<br>I am Sydney Carton and decide to be guillotined in place of someone else (one person saved by my thoughts)<br><br>Just about every facet of my life is caused by the thinking of me or someone else. Even natural events like earthquakes, floods, etc, will be conditioned by people's reaction to them.<br><br>How far is cancer along the continuum? My guess is that it is unlikely to be either 100% or 0%, but will vary with the individual case. It's just a guess - I don't know the answer - but to insist on dogmatic grounds that it's 0% seems just perverse.<br><br>The only thing I am sure of is that if I am ever, God forbid, diagnosed with cancer, I am going to try to maintain as positive an attitude as possible.</div>

You seem to have decided that thinking is not effective.<br><br>You'd have to dig into it probably more than you'd like to but it seems as if "thinking" takes place in more places than the brain.  We are starting to come around to the notion that thinking is distributed throughout the entire organism.  IOW, you DO think with your heart (and liver and lungs and spleen).  In fact, thoughts produce enzymes and "messenger molecules" which move at incredible speed throughout the body ... down to the cellular level.  It is quite fascinating how this all seems to work.<br><br>Should you be interested in this I can recommend:<br><br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_0_11?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=ernest+rossi&sprefix=ernest+ross" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_0_11?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=ernest+rossi&sprefix=ernest+ross</a><br><br>Particularly the first four or five books listed.<br><br>>>>  Comprende, amigo? <<< <br><br>I don't think so ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>>>>  My view for what it's worth is that *of course* my thoughts effect my health and indeed my very existence. The only question is how much in any particular situation. It's a continuum.<br><br>At the extremes of the continuum:<br><br>I decide to commit suicide and succeed. (Nearly 100% caused by my thoughts)<br>I get killed by a random bullet in a street shooting (Nearly 0% caused by my thoughts)<br><br>My thinking also effects other people's health:  <<<<br><br>I'd say it was your actions that RESULTED from your thinking that affects others.  That is the whole problem with "The Secret".  It basically posits that thoughts are "things".  If you wish upon a star and all of that.  Thinking directly affects your outlook, your health and by those effects influences others.  You won't get rich by saying over and over: "I'm getting rich now."  But you might think yourself into a positive frame of mind that makes you attractive to others and that might "open doors" for you that wind up giving you opportunities you may not have gotten with a sour attitude.<br><br>>>>  I am Adolf Hitler and decide to invade Russia (millions of people killed by my thoughts)  <<<<br><br>Actually, by the bullets and explosions and gas.<br><br>>>>  I am Sydney Carton and decide to be guillotined in place of someone else (one person saved by my thoughts)  <<<<br><br>Actually by the failure of the moron running the execution who does a poor job of checking ID.<br><br>>>>  Just about every facet of my life is caused by the thinking of me or someone else. Even natural events like earthquakes, floods, etc, will be conditioned by people's reaction to them.  <<<<br><br>Yes, a very much overlooked side effect.<br><br>>>>  How far is cancer along the continuum? My guess is that it is unlikely to be either 100% or 0%, but will vary with the individual case. It's just a guess - I don't know the answer - but to insist on dogmatic grounds that it's 0% seems just perverse.  <<<<br><br>Just as insisting (a la Mary Baker Eddy) that it is 100%.  It is whatever it is but it is something and not dealing with that something is just nutty.<br><br>>>>  The only thing I am sure of is that if I am ever, God forbid, diagnosed with cancer, I am going to try to maintain as positive an attitude as possible.  <<<<br><br>Evidence shows that will most likely help ... and could not possibly hurt.  And why stop there?  A positive attitude could only help in anything you experience.<br><br>In the last analysis genetics probably has more to do with the course of our health than anything else.  But again, who knows?</div>

<div class="content">Steve,<br><br>>>>  In your response to Mark, particularly in your assertion that it is ACTIONS resulting from THOUGHTS which lead to change, you are stating a position that makes complete sense to me.  <<<<br><br>That's good to hear ;-)  But to be perfectly clear:<br><br>Thoughts have three "classes" of results:<br><br>- Internal biochemical and psychosomatic changes<br><br>- Personal attitude changes (outlook on life and such)<br><br>- The actions one takes following from them<br><br>The first is responsible for the healing power of thoughts.  The second affects how we interact with the world psychologically and influence change indirectly.  The third affects what we can change about "things" and other people in a direct way.<br><br>So to try a contrived example:<br><br>I'm sick with a serious illness.  I think positive thoughts.  That mobilizes my internal biochemistry to help fight the disease.  It also improves my attitude so my care givers are more motivated to go that extra mile for me and I get better care.  I might get into a drug trial because my doctor "likes me".  Finally, my having a better outlook might get me to do more exercise, follow instructions when I don't want to, and generally do anything else I can think of to help.<br><br>All of those things can be important to my recovery.</div>

<div class="content">Mike:<br><br><< That is the same reductionist argument that Norman uses. Thoughts are not the same as the brain that causes them. >><br><br>Can I get this straight? Are you saying that the brain causes thoughts, but thoughts are in some way separate entities of some kind? I can't quite follow what you think they are. Presumably as an atheist you don't think there is some sort of "soul" involved. I'm not disagreeing with you here, just seeking clarification.<br><br>------ <br><br>My problem with what Norman is saying is that, if there is no such thing as mind - which is what I understand him to be saying - then thoughts are presumably produced by the body. If this body is suffering from cancer,  then the person's thoughts about the cancer are part of the body's reaction to the cancer. They may therefore be an important part of the healing process of the body (frequently not successful, just the other healing processes of the body are frequently not successful).<br><br>I'm not sure Norman can have it both ways. If there is a mind and it produces thoughts then it's possible for it to be wrong.

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>>>>  << That is the same reductionist argument that Norman uses. Thoughts are not the same as the brain that causes them. >><br><br>Can I get this straight? Are you saying that the brain causes thoughts, but thoughts are in some way separate entities of some kind?  >>><br><br>No, they are not "entities".  As I said, they don't exist as "things".  They are functions of the mind.  If a radio plays a song, the song "exists" but not as a concrete "thing" ... you can't collect a basket full of them.  You can define what the radio is, but you might not be able to define the process that caused the song to come into existence out of the radio's speakers ... but that does not mean that it did not, or that the radio had nothing to do with it.<br><br>>>>  I can't quite follow what you think they are. Presumably as an atheist you don't think there is some sort of "soul" involved. I'm not disagreeing with you here, just seeking clarification.  <<<<br><br>As Norman would say, we don't know a lot about what they are.  I can better say what they are not.  They are not equal to the brain.  That is the reductionist fallacy that Norman seems to be stuck in.  They are not "things" which are somehow generated and take on a physical existence.  They can't move around and change reality in any way ... they can only affect the thinker himself and that is where this all started.  Thinking positively changes us in ways that improves health, among other things.<br><br>No, there is no "soul" but I'm not going to say what mind is ... in fact, there are some philosophical arguments that whatever it is, it is not likely to be able to say much about itself.  But let's not go there.<br><br>------<br><br>>>>  My problem with what Norman is saying is that, if there is no such thing as mind - which is what I understand him to be saying - then thoughts are presumably produced by the body.  <<<<br><br>Well, yeah, what else would produce them?  "Mind" is just a way of talking about that function of the body which produces thoughts.<br><br>>>>  If this body is suffering from cancer, then the person's thoughts about the cancer are part of the body's reaction to the cancer. They may therefore be an important part of the healing process of the body (frequently not successful, just the other healing processes of the body are frequently not successful).  <<<<br><br>Yes, exactly so.  A related idea is one by Milton Erickson which goes a bit like this:  Disease is caused by the imbalance of various chemicals in the body so if the body caused the imbalance the body can correct it.  (Don't hold me to the precision of the exposition of that idea.)<br><br>>>>  I'm not sure Norman can have it both ways. If there is a mind and it produces thoughts then it's possible for it to be wrong. But if there is no mind, then the thoughts are just part of the process which the body is going through and cannot be wrong in the same sense. <<<<br><br>Yeah, and if the body is producing thoughts the name we give to that process is ... wait for it ... "mind".  Picking an argument with the use of the word does not change much.</div>

<div class="content">I'm not sure that darwinistic theories are the future, nor do I think assumptions that mind and consciousness are simply byproducts of a material brain. I think one of the problems in science is that researchers are hell bent on finding the mind in the parts. But we don't even understand the parts, because the deeper we look, the more mysterious they act. <br><br>We're only just figuring out that (brain)cells are much more than we thought they were. We are finding out they have their own computing power, that they make decisions. Or to quote University of Cambridge research biologist Brian J. Ford. "Each individual neuron is itself a computer, and the brain a vast community of microscopic computers... the human brain may be a trillion times more capable than we imagine"<br>When Darwin lived, they thought cells were blobs of matter. <br><br>With that we can only start to appreciate how hard it is to measure thought and its effects, especially when it involves so many systems interacting. We can only take measurements of visible signals that take place that our measurement devices can pick up on. Right now that's typically by making brainscans and seeing what areas of the brain light up and are deemed 'activated' and by measuring electrical and magnetic activity. But FMRI studies are easily misinterpreted and there is only so much we can deduce from the apparent frequency of a thought. In a recent BBC program that debunked potential positive effects of brain games, they did a fairly simple demonstration where two people raced cars that were controlled by their thoughts (With neurofeedback equipment). We are at least capable of training our equipment to distinguish two thoughts. <br><br>We've got studies going as far back as the sixties that show we can accomplish effects in simple organisms, like bacteria, from a distance, using thought alone. That's two steps ahead of what Norman feels is possible. That's evidence that is over 40 years old. <br><br>My problem with a materialist approach is that it is a deadend, it's a cop out. This analogy came from a materialist, I might have been Daniel Dennett, I can't remember, but the analogy tries to explain the mind as follows. You take the musical instrument, say an Organ, we know it can produce incredibly complex melody when all the notes are played. We know a lot about how this musical instrument is constructed, the wooden frame, the pedals etc. All the individual elements are quite simple, yet they give rise in unison to something really complex, music. A materialist is comfortable in saying that the mind is the result of a collection of parts giving rise to consciousness etc. What a materialist can't answer, and more alarmingly, doesn't feel is important to answer is why the music sounds beautiful, who is playing the music, why it is playing the music and who composed the music. Like wise, a materialist can't explain why we feel emotions, they can only say, well there's all these neurochemicals bombarding certain parts of the brain. They can't explain why chocolate tastes so good. A materialist can't explain why despite the absence of brain activity, a landmark study done in the Netherlands found that patients suffering cardiac arrest reported perceptions and experiences associated with near death experiences. This should be impossible based on materialist approaches. <br> <br>Norman referred to the article discussing the apparent rise of the placebo effect over the last decades. One of the underlying problems in science is that it's never really objective, that's mostly an illusion. The underlying motives of pharmaceutical industries have influenced the results of experiments of drugs, which is probably the main reason why we're seeing strange data around the placebo and nocebo effects. What seems to be the case is that the practice of science, where we are told to hold our hats on to ideals of rigorous evidence using controlled and strict criteria and peer reviewing every study in detail, in actual fact is always subject to bias and underlying motives and that is what shapes research for the good and the bad. A current trend for example, is the use of Neo-darwinism as one of the bases of evidence to attack religious influence in the world today - we see scientists like Richard Dawkins calling for the head of the pope. And who knows if it is a good thing that scientists take political stances as bold as that, but it definitely underlines how much the practice of science is ruled and coloured by very human motives. <br><br>The sad thing is that research into consciousness, free will, the effect of thought and intention  are researched mostly by a fringe group of scientists who get little support. There are again very human reasons for doing so, because it's 'not done' to deviate from a materialist approach, to question darwinism. Any suggestion in the opposite direction leads to ridicule. It's certainly not the open mind like culture you'd expect based on scientific ideals. And it's no wonder that a lot of the major advances in science have come from outside the establishment. <br><br>But the interesting thing is that answering questions about the nature of thought, intention, consciousness, mind and free will are all interrelated, and how we approach these important questions has everything to do with how we approach life. Reducing the brain to a machine that secretes thought also has implications on how we treat free will (in which case free will is just an idea not actuality), consciounsess, morals, responsibility etc. Just one answer to one of the above topics reveals a lot about one's stance on all of the above. Or it reveals a lack of understanding or lack of appreciation for the ramifications of an assumption we might hold. <br><br>I think it's naive to put our heads in the sand and make statements like Normans, as if they were factual. I also think its naive to depend entirely on what science has produced in the way of peer reviewed study alone in the current moment, considering the state of affairs I've pointed out above. It's a cheap cop out. And in similar vein, like Mike said, just because we have concepts like the mind and thought that are hard to confine in a definition we can all agree on, doesn't mean we should discard the topic.</div>

<div class="content">Mike, if I read you right, there's an unspoken New-Age bent to your thinking -- a hope, somewhere, that "wishing will make it so," and that "mind over matter" is something we can all achieve.  You are not offering a "course on miracles" and you're too smart to ask for one -- but you're still holding out hope.  And heck, there's no harm in that.</div>

<div class="content">Last statement and brief:<br><br>Mike you really have no idea what you are talking about. I don't think you are even trying to read the posts.<br><br>The very fact when I mention we have not thought through our Western tradition, implies nothing about an "Eastern tradition". If you have read my posts, I argue such a turn to the East is pointless if we don't even understand thoroughly own tradition since the metaphysical prejudices of our tradition are in full sway and would color that understanding.<br><br>And the mention of the book as noted, was simply to steal the title (ironically). The book itself is simply rubbish.<br><br>Again no one has even begun to address my criticisms. There is nothing above but a collection of straw men.<br><br>One last tip on reading comprehension Mike. I didn't say you couldn't define a thought. I challenged you to do so in a manner that would allow it to be measured qualitatively and quantitatively. And yes you have to do this to study something. It is tautological. And for further edification. Everyone has a definition for anything thing they speak about implicit or explicit.<br><br>Science is a pallid and boring way to understand most anything but it does have its place. The role of thoughts and their affect on cancer is one of them. So far science has absolutely nothing to say on the matter.<br><br>Whether the brain or the pancreas has a role in remission or progression of cancer is another topic. <br><br>The very fact that you would assume a thought to be something "material" and a "process" of a brain is proof of these lingering and problematic notions of the "mind' and "body" within the Western tradition.<br><br>To paraphrase a great mind who struggled with these issued in probably the most thorough and rigorous manner:<br><br>The most thought-provoking thing about thought is that we have not really begun to think about it at all.<br><br>This from one of the most penetrating thinkers of the past 2500 years. And simply attempted to form the problem in a thorough way. So no, I don't have any secret knowledge. I just am aware of the utter void of rigorous understanding in this area.<br><br>Forget the body. We handed that over to science a long time ago. This is a scandal of the Western tradition. And again, this does not imply that the East has something to offer. We have to return to our tradition (we have no choice for it is all we have) and see what bare threads exist which have informed of understanding of the body and pursue them in a rigorous manner.<br><br>But all that is beside the point. <br><br>Define a thought in such a way one can measure qualitatively and qualitatively.<br><br>You can't. We don't thoroughly understand what we mean by this word. At best we have analogous phenomena gathered by various crude instruments measuring meager aspects of our "bodies".<br><br>Whether these are merely correlative or epiphenomena we can only guess, unless we just simply label these measurements as thoughts.</div>

<div class="content">To put this thread back into the context of "Getting Things Done".

<div class="content">We don't need to define "thought".  We don't need to measure thought quantitatively or qualitatively.  <br><br>Nobody here is claiming that thought cures cancer.  Several are claiming that what you think has a bearing on how your body behaves.  <br>This has been proven by the placebo studies:<br><br>Give treatment A, and this results.  Give treatment B, and that results.  Only A and B are both medically inert substances, so the cause of variation is something other than the treatment.<br><br>We are getting nowhere with the debate if you just deny the fact of these studies.<br><br>My position: Thinking does help.  I can raise my hand by thought.  I can increase or decrease my heart rate by thought.  I can inhibit my body's immune system by thought, but more effectively I can use my thinking to  buy fast food to weaken my body, or I can use thinking to buy healthy food and live more healthy.  None of this will cure cancer, but continuing in unhealthy fashion can only hurt.<br><br>As for this forum, effective thinking isn't always easy.
