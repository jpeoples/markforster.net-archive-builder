<div class="content">I started the new year using a page a day diary thinking I could write down each day the things I wanted to get done.  After less than a week, it became apparent this was going to require lots of rewriting or was going to soon become too many pages.  Additionally, while I had been a huge proponent of a single notebook, the flaw with that method for me is projects.  I work on too many projects and soon had a mish mash of lists and notes and spent lots of time flipping pages.  <br><br>I am going to try the modified AF rules I came up with in a Moleskin type notebook.  Notes will be taken on a separate legal pad and immediately filed in the project file with actions noted on the AF list.<br><br>In order to stay true to the system, I have pasted the rules on the inside of the cover so I can review them.  I plan to stick with this system until at least one full book is filled up, which is 240 pages.<br><br>The rules are as follow:<br><br>1) Read quickly through all the items on the page without taking action on any of them.<br>2) Go through the page more slowly looking at the items in order until one stands out for you. Stand out means one of two things<br>a) You know it no longer needs to be done and you cross it out<br>b) The item needs to be done now and you:<br>i) Work on that item for as long as you feel like doing so<br>ii) When done working on it, cross the item off the list paying attention to the following rules:<br>(a) If you haven’t finished it, re-enter it at the end of the list using a new description of a task you believe can now be finished in one sitting.<br>(b) If the task is finished and related to a bigger project, add the next logical step/task needed to complete the project to the end of the list<br>3) Continue going round the same page in the same way. Don’t move onto the next page until you complete a pass of the page without any item standing out<br>4) Move onto the next page and repeat the process<br>5) Once you’ve finished with the final page, re-start at the first page that is still active<br><br>Tips<br><br>Only use this system and make sure to include everything on this list<br>When the notebook is filled up, start fresh to ensure at least a few reviews a year.<br><br>Thanks<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">Gerry, do you have any rules for start of the day, as with recent discussions?<br><br>Such as at beginning of new day, do you start on last page in the notebook OR do you start on the page you were on at end of day yesterday?<br><br>thanks, Matthew</div>

<div class="content">Matthews<br><br>I do not. I am just planning to note possible improvements and decide at the end of the notebook if they are worthwhile. I have been starting on page one each day. <br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">After a couple of weeks of this, I have abandoned it.  I am coming to realize, I am not a great rule follower and the system was actually getting on my nerves.  I have great respect for those who have been able to stick with a rules based system for a long time, however it just does not seem to jive with my personality.  <br><br>I will be going back to a free form notebook and winging it for awhile.  The only rule will be write in one place.<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">Hi Gerry,<br><br><< I will be going back to a free form notebook and winging it for awhile. The only rule will be write in one place. >><br><br>I am coming pretty much to the same conclusion.   I've been using some principles from AF1 implemented in OneNote.   And that gradually developed into "AutoDIT", with a focus on "TODAY".    And that was very helpful for quite some time.<br><br>But sometimes it's NOT so helpful.  It is usually very good at work.  But lately, at home, I have sporadic bits of time to get things done, with some longer chunks of time on the weekends.   The "TODAY" focus doesn't really help in that context.<br><br>So I've decided to let my system evolve.  <br><br>And this led me to another realization.   For awhile, I was complaining about rules that FORCE you to do something (such as AF1's dismissal rule).   I "dismissed" the dismissal rule, and that worked really well.   I still have the principle, but not the rule, meaning, I dismiss stuff whenever I feel it is the right time to dismiss stuff.<br><br>But here's the realization I had:  I am not just resisting the rules that have a forcing function.   I have a problem with rules-based systems, period.  Sometimes the situation at hand calls for something that's not allowed by the rules.   So, I can either follow the rules, or I can do what needs doing.   Generally I choose the latter, but it comes with some mental dissonance if I am really trying to be conscientious about following the rules.<br><br>So I'm still using many structures and principles from AF1:   frequent cycling, little-and-often, dismiss things that have gone stale, etc.    And I'm using some principles from AutoDIT:  create a "hotlist" for today -- if I feel I need such a list at the moment -- and aggressively send things off to the Tickler if they can't be started right now.   Those ideas are all helpful, very powerful, even.   But not all the time, in all situations.   <br><br>I suppose my TMS focus now is on basic structures and principles to help support my decision making.   But it needs to be ME that makes those decisions, not the system.   "Rules" (in the sense of a fixed heuristic or algorithmic process) get in the way of that...</div>

<div class="content">I'm not trying to say that "rules" are useless...   I think Mark's focus on "exercises" can be very helpful.  It can be really helpful to follow some particular rule of action for a particular set time period in order to establish some new habits or behaviors.   But I'm not so sure it's useful or desirable to establish a heuristic intended to process all individual human action indefinitely.  :-)</div>

You might also think of it as a map, versus a written list of driving directions (rules). The driving directions are more fragile, breaking down if you are forced off course for some reason (road closure), whereas the map will always show you what has to happen to get from point A to point B, including multiple available paths.<br><br>Examples:<br>- a list of today's appointments<br>- a list of projects you have started but not finished<br>- a list of timely background tasks such as changing the light bulb by the back porch<br><br>To use the above, it would be essential to understand good work habits, such as little & often, "psychologically ready to be done," one thing at a time, and any of Mark Forster's other favorite principles. I am not suggesting that the above is a complete system, but I hope it is clear how that information alone would inspire action if displayed all together in a concise manner.<br><br>AutoFocus as written is very close to being a dashboard, especially if one adds a few small symbols to mark unfinished tasks or same-day urgent, etc. The way one's current work congregates on the last pages makes those pages quite a compelling display, when coupled with an appointment calendar. This relies, of course on following the rule of always writing unfinished items on the last page, but it does not require following the dismissal rule (meaning that one might dismiss pages at will, but not by rule).<br><br>People who time-block can add their time block schedule to the picture, so that one might make a dashboard out of an appointment calendar + time blocks +  AutoFocus.<br><br>I'm not going to say "down with rules," for even the most relaxed dashboard has rules of the form "write your appointments here, sorted by time of day," or "write all your current projects in this section, sorted by how long you think each will take to finish," or "make a tally mark next to any project each time you action it," but I think we are complaining about the rules that prescribe how to select our next task to work on. We want rules that harvest and display information for our decision-making benefit, but not rules that attempt to dictate those decisions. If the information display arises spontaneously from the process of getting our work done, as opposed to requiring a dedicated planning session, that is ideal. In that respect, AutoFocus is ideal.<br><br>Dashboard Utopia would be a one-page display that quickly suggests to its user, at a glance, what to do next. Like a map, it may suggest different routes to different users, but everyone will arrive in the same place.<br><br>Is that perfection possible? I really don't know. Have I solved it? No, not even close. The closest thing I've seen or experienced is a relaxed version of AutoFocus, plus the typical supporting structures such as a calendar and daily checklist, and that was invented by Mark Forster. It is quite a good system and has wonderful dashboard potential, in my opinion. In addition, following the rules of AF-like systems is a wonderful way to *learn* the good habits of little & often, etc., which I sorely needed.<br><br>So, lest anyone mistake this for a rebellion against our AF/DWM/DIT rule-based systems, it is quite the opposite. What I'm stumbling on here is a shift in perspective about these rules, that some are highly useful information-harvesters and some are bosses whom we grow to resent, and some are both. The information-harvesters have won our admiration as strokes of pure genius, while the bossy ones have tended to create resistance and send us tweaking and searching for new systems.<br><br>Perhaps that perspective will lead us toward more information-oriented rules and away from the bossy ones ... maybe even to that perfect magical AF tweak that produces no resistance!</div>

<div class="content">If I may, I'll present Seraphim's journey in charicature:<br>Life was chaotic.  Then AF1 came and life became semi-chaotic. Then autoDIT came and life became orderly, except occasional failings. <br><br>Now why is it only after a very successful system comes that the leap can be made to dumping the rules?  It's because the rules were your Tutor.</div>

<div class="content">You mentioned about AutoDIT not fitting your home work schedule.  If I may, I'd suggest you merely want different rules for a different context.  That's my conclusion for my situation.  Daily isn't a useful concept for home work.</div>

<div class="content">My pattern is:<br><br>1. Try someone's system and abandon it when it does not work for me.<br>2. Design a system that looks like it will work on paper either from scratch or by tweaking another person's system.<br>3. Use that system until I realize that it is so complicated or time consuming it does not work better than the most simple system I used which is writing everything I need to do and notes in a simple notebook, reviewing the notebook frequently and then actually doing work.<br>4. Not stopping myself before I go back to #1.<br><br>Gerry<br><br>ps this applies only to time management systems not DOIT which I have never tweaked and works well.</div>

<div class="content">"(1) allows me to work in little snippets of time, quick start, quick stop, because that's all the time I have available and (2) still allows me to make (and track) progress towards results that matter."<br><br>I think having a page of "Be sure to address in the near future" will serve #2 quite well.  It's like that AutoDIT Tomorrow list, but it isn't so time-bound.  Use AutoDIT or AF1 rules in conjunction.  <br><br>In my case the home list is small enough that just turning to the last AF page is sufficient to answer (2) for me without a special list.</div>

<div class="content">Alan wrote:<br><< It's because the rules were your Tutor. >><br>Yes, agreed. As in sports technique, one starts out needing step-by-step instructions—plant the foot, draw the leg back at such an angle, etc.—but after developing muscle memory and a properly calibrated intuition, the trick is to get the rational mind out of the way, and excess tension, self-consciousness, etc. That's when your coach gets all starry-eyed and says things like, "Be the ball," and you begin to be admired for your impeccable sense of when to break the conventional rules. (not the rules of the game, but those of technique and strategy)<br><br>AutoFocus is a wonderful tutor. In retrospect, I must be jumping the gun, because I cannot say that I have graduated from my tutor's lessons, particularly when it comes to dismissal. So perhaps I should get back out on the field and follow the training rules a bit longer ... but for the sake of this discussion, I am wondering what comes after AutoFocus. What will it look like to "be the ball" after graduating? My feeling is that it involves the kind of dashboard display I mentioned earlier, inspiring a free flow of productive actions.<br><br><br>Mark wrote:<br><<I think I wrote something about that a year or so ago, wondering whether after doing a system for long enough the principles would be so imbedded in one's mind that one would no longer need the system.

<div class="content">Bernie: " I am wondering what comes after AutoFocus."<br><br>Final Version, of course!  But setting that aside, dismissing the rules doesn't mean dismissing the system. You will still follow the rules, just not always. Your habits will be more nuanced than a brief ruleset will capture. There will be exceptions to the rule and over time things will evolve.</div>
