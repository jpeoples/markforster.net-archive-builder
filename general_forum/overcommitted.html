<div class="content">There's really only one answer, Sharkey, and that is to do an audit of your commitments and identify the ones that are most important to your work, business and/or life and chuck the rest out. For business you should concentrate on the core work that affects the bottom line.<br><br>It helps this process if you restrict your working hours more than usual as this forces you to concentrate on what is important.</div>
