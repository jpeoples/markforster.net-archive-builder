<div class="content">I just discovered your site and there is definitely something about your ideas that resonates with me. I'd like to buy Do it Tomorrow; do you know if there's anywhere in the US I can buy or order it from? Amazon is estimating 3-6 weeks before it ships out and I'd certainly like to get started sooner than that. Thanks for any information.<br><br>Andy</div>

<div class="content">Dear Andy, thanks for your query. Unfortunately there is no US distributor for DIT, and I don't think there are any plans for one in the pipeline. I used to recommend people to order from amazon.co.uk but I understand that they won't any longer deliver it to a US address.<br><br>Currently I am recommending purchasing the book from the "More Buying Choices" section on the Amazon.com page. Several of the vendors there claim to be shipping from within the US. My experiences with these vendors on Amazon have always been good.</div>

<div class="content">I got a copy in 11 days from an Amazon 3rd party seller called pbshopus. And the shipping charge was the same as if it had been mailed in the U.S.<br><br>G. Garrett</div>
