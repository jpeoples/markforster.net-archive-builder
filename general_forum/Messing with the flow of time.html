<div class="content">Amusingly recent speculations suggest time emerges from timelessness via fractal unfolding: <br><br>"A fractal concept of time differentiates the length, depth and density of time. If the<br>length of time is determined by a LOD-generating subject, duration turns into a two-<br>dimensional phenomenon: The length of time is generated through incompatible facts<br>("before-after-relations"), the depth of time through nested, compatible facts"<br><br>see <a href="http://www.if-online.org/Fractal%20Time%20pdf%20file.pdf" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.if-online.org/Fractal%20Time%20pdf%20file.pdf</a><br><br>or in a more easily understood form: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fractal-Time-Secret-2012-World/dp/1401920659" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Fractal-Time-Secret-2012-World/dp/1401920659</a></div>
