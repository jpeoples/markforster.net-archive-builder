<div class="content">I recently moved from a position where tasks were assigned to me to a position where I got to choose what I should do. With that freedom came an explosion of things to be done and I'm having to learn how to manage all of it. I recently read GTD; I'm waiting for DIT to be delivered from Amazon; I'm going through forums like this trying to get a handle on things.<br><br>There are a handful of specific things that I'm unclear on, but it would probably be best if I separated each of them into individual posts. Until then, though, I was wondering if anyone could offer any advice for a beginning like me to help me get up to speed with the rest of the community here. (I still get lost on some of the acronyms that have been unofficially adopted. lol)<br><br>I appreciate the help, and I look forward to the journey ahead. ;)</div>

<div class="content">Welcome,<br><br>The world of TM can be confusing.  GTD is a completely different system from Marks' DIT.  I personally believe time management systems should be selected based upon a specific need a person has and that off the shelf systems may not solve your particular problem and in fact can cost more time than they save.  If you can give us some information on your specific situation and what you are trying to accomplish people may be able to give more targeted advice.  Good luck<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">Hi J<br>as said Gerry GTD is a specific system and AF like DIT too. <br><br>GTD is more structured based on control and perspective. <br>It's also based on projects, contexts and a way of acting. <br><br>AF is more intuitive. There are many of them but each is more suitable to a specific way of acting and dealing with urgencies and timing. <br><br>Now this said, it's very difficult to answer to your question. <br>First because each of us has specific problem we all try to solve. And you will see that some of us are enthusiastic with one system and later on will get rid of it for another one. <br><br>Secont, I guess the main problem when you become on your own is how you use your freedom and how you decide and for what. <br><br>Third,  organization take time. <br>There is no miracle. Some suits other not. One time something is great and after somthing else. <br><br>And if you want to begin by something i would suggest first to stay concentrate on ideas. <br>What do you really want too do ? Why, How can you do it...<br>Use picture, use mindmapping if you know it, your are like a sailor you must know where you are going to. <br><br>Of course,  GTD will give you some real basis. But sometime it is quiet complicated to stick with the system. AF is fantastic but if you know where you are going.<br><br>So, if you want us to help you, try to explain as said Gerry your specific situation. What happen in you life ? What are the main problems ? Where do you want to go and may be will will be able to help you if we can...</div>

<div class="content">Greetings.  The above guys are right, but you can get started now.  Two things are fundamental, everything else is extra:<br>a) Knowing what to do<br>b) Doing it in reasonable time.<br><br>AutoFocus is an extremely simple system that handles these issues easily.  You can get going in only 15 minutes.  So my advice: <br>1. Read <a href="http://www.markforster.net/autofocus-index/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/autofocus-index/</a> , especially AF1 and AF4 pages.<br>2. Pick one and get started now. Stick with it a day to get the feel of it.<br>3. Then check out Mark's blog on the upper left to learn about other options.<br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2010/12/16/review-of-the-systems.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2010/12/16/review-of-the-systems.html</a><br><br>AF will get you started, but it's only a core system, not complete by itself.  Add in ideas from the DIT book, and it will be more complete.  And local folk have lots of ideas too.<br><br>The GTD book has some good ideas, but the system itself is too complicated.  I'd suggest to start with AF, and take in helpful GTD ideas later as you move along.</div>

<div class="content">Thank you for the welcome! As I said, I have several distinct issues and it might be better to address each individually. However, I will list them all here briefly, as well as better describe why I'm here.<br><br>I'm a programmer. I'm a VERY technical and structured thinker. (It sucks, sometimes.) I have always shied away from management because I enjoy the nitty gritty code too much. I've also always worked in the corporate world where, even if I was given free reign to design some solution, I was still always told what solution to design.<br><br>I recently left the corporate world, joined with a salesman, and started my own company. Yay! We sell software. I'm the only software guy; the other guy takes care of the "business" aspects. But now, instead of just working on a given project, I have control of new products, product direction, support, implementation, all kinds of stuff. It's a bit like going from paying rent in an apartment to owning a house and having to deal with maintenance, landscaping, HOA, et al. Yay!<br><br>With that background, here's (briefly) the things that I still struggle with:<br>* I am responsible for making sure that we implement an interface to another vendor's software. I'm waiting on someone from that other company to get some information back to me. What are some recommendations on how to keep visibility of this responsibility even though I cannot take any action on it?<br>* I have a handful of tasks. I also have several projects open, each of which has many tasks. What are some recommendations on dealing with related groups of tasks (like projects) without losing sight of tasks that aren't related to that group/project?<br>* GTD recommends that I identify the "next action". For projects, you naturally run into task dependencies. When I complete my "next action", it may free up any number of dependent tasks. What are some good methods for remembering to check for new "next actions" as a result of finishing a task? (This one may just be a matter of self-discipline, pure and simple.)<br>* AF, from what I've read so far, seems like a great way to get started on tasks. But it also seems like I run the risk of starting too many things without actually finishing any of them. If I were using AF4, I would imagine a "New" list that stays short, but an "Unfinished" list that grows out of control. Any tips on making sure I actually finish things?<br>* Any recommendations on how to centrally manage everything electronically? Right now, I have my projects detailed out in OpenProj, I have my tasks in ToodleDo (because it syncs with Pocket Informant on my phone), and I've started using GQueues (based on a user's post here about AF4). It's starting to get to the point that just managing my tasks-- in three different places-- is too confusing.<br><br>For others learning in the future, it would be best to address each of these issues separately. It would allow for a more focused discussion which would yield more appropriate information. (Yeah, I do a lot of peer support in my field, and almost everyone else in my family is a teacher. (grin)) I'll probably copy-n-paste the first one into a new post tomorrow morning to get started.</div>

<div class="content">Hi,<br><br>My two cents for what it is worth. I have tried many systems in my career as a current  executive and once manager. Aside from the various AFs, my longest system prior was GTD. This is what I've learned.<br><br>Less overhead the better, as your goal should be doing, not processing. So don't worry about identifying next actions/dependencies or even projects. Just put it all down and start doing. In the process of doing you may need to make identify actions/make a project sheet, etc but don't do that for everything and don't do that as an action in of itself. Do your work (as you define it) and if you find you need to take a step back and organize, do it then.<br><br>Do review your work often. I find the AF method (SAF for me) has a built in review as you go through pages, but whatever format you do make sure you review often. If you do this you then...<br><br>Don't preprioritize. If you don't know what to do, do something, anything that you define as work. Eventually the priorities will shine through.<br><br>Don't think you have to use an online system. I have tried both and find paper is best, even though I am in front of a computer literally 10 hours a day and have very messy handwriting. I don't think I do anything else that is analog (I read on a Kindle and listen to MP3s, for example) but I keep my list in a notebook.<br><br>Do, though, have a digital reference system. Your list is for doing and something else should be for reference (David Allen IMO got this right). I have tried many reference systems, I now rely on two 1) Toodledo for e-mail reference of specific tasks listed on my notebook, and a simple excel sheet of internet links I use for project research.<br><br>Does this help (Hopefully it doesn't hurt)...</div>

<div class="content">jFenter,<br><br>Congratulations on the entrepreneurial move.  Please note, I only use paper systems so I can't help with electronics.  I personally believe in simplicity and would use the least you can get away with. Every minute organizing is a minute not doing, which I try to keep in mind.<br><br>I have found if I stick to two main principles I get good results.  They are write in one place (spiral notebook or legal pad) and maintain a simple A - Z filing system (can be electronic, paper or both).  I only use one notebook at a time, no post its, scraps of paper etc.  While I may have to flip around a notebook, I know that anything I need or am tracking is in that one notebook and nowhere else.<br><br>The issue of project management and task management is one we have debated here a lot.  Very complicated projects can be hard to manage in a TM system.  But key items or reminders to review project plans can be useful to put into a TM system.<br><br>I do find a waiting for list or noting in my notebook that I am waiting for something to be very helpful.  <br><br>I do sometimes make a daily list (on the last page of the notebook) for days when I really need to ensure a few things get done.<br><br>If you are interested, I have a some additional free resources on my site.<br><br>Good luck<br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div>

<div class="content">@jFenter<br><br>Welcome on Board!<br><br>I will not repeat what others have said because it is all good advice/opinions. What I will say is that David Allen got me on track for "organization". The more organized you are, the less overhead when actually doing. But the organization itself should not produce overhead as you clean your stuff up or search for what to do next.<br><br>As for doing itself, Mark's system is more intuitive. That said, I'm not a list user. As others have mentioned, there are a lot of different opinions and systems floating around here. That is the reason I really like this place; people can exchange opinions about various systems and help one another understand their own needs and choice system's strong and weak points. I use a Personal Kanban and I believe it might be suited for a "code" oriented person like you.</div>

<div class="content">jFenter, I'm in a similar circumstance.  I'm a computer programmer now running a software company.  Before I found AutoFocus and this site, I struggled with all the myriad things I needed to do.<br><br>People here know good techniques for about every problem you might have, but I fear you will be totally overwhelmed if you try to solve them all at once.  Figure out one thing at a time.  You won't manage everything perfectly, but it won't take long to be on top of things.  Start with an ordinary system for recording stuff and doing them. <br><br>To answer one question:<br>"But it [AF4] also seems like I run the risk of starting too many things without actually finishing any of them. If I were using AF4, I would imagine a "New" list that stays short, but an "Unfinished" list that grows out of control. Any tips on making sure I actually finish things?"<br><br>Your question seems to be about AF4R, an update of AF4.  You can control "Unfinished" quite easily by keeping focused on that list, working on those things,  and finishing things. Try to make things on your list medium sized so they actually get done [finishing stuff is a motivator]; then you can enter the next part as a new item.</div>

<div class="content">100% agree with  Vegheadjones and Congratulations on the entrepreneurial move.<br><br>I like GTD very much but for a long time I stuggled with digital system. I now use paper <br>Now I make things simple and it work perfectly. <br><br>I like GTD for project, collect and review. For the rest it drive me nut. <br><br>I love AF for working little by little. It let me free to do my work as I feel it. <br>GTD for acting blocked me and made me acting wrongly. It was too structured. <br><br>AF for action is perfect. It is more intuitive. <br><br>I have my special method. I explained how it works on the forum. <br><br>Now it becomes little by little very simple indeed !. <br><br>I have a 2 binders with paper sheets. One binder is containing one my projects included in plastic files and the other contains list, aims AF list and some specific list goals which are easy to catch. the way its organized let me free to test things, create lists  and i like it like this. <br><br>I also have a paper notebook where I daily write my AF list extracted from my binders each night. I like it like this for the feeling of paper and because I have many incoming information arriving at any moment and many many interruptions. <br><br>At night I do  a little DAILY REVIEW. I look to my diary, my projects, my mails, eliminates, report my stuf on my projects and create a new list of all I am waiting for during the day and what I will do on my notebook for the next morning, and cross all what needs to be crossed. There is nbothing on my notebook list but most important thing I must do and I can tell you that there are a lot of tasks (sometime over 30). <br><br>During the day I focus on my note book writing, crossing reporting and having a brief look to my project if I am working on one. <br><br>Each week I doo a weekly review and report every thing on my note book and fixe me some weekly goals. Idem for month, quarter, and year. <br><br>My method is not regular. But it works for me even if it's is a bit different from the classic AF method.<br><br>One thing I have learned is don't make things complicated if there are they are wrong. <br>And dont use yu computer until your paper method will work perfectly for 1 year ! LOL</div>
