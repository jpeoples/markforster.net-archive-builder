<div class="content">Personally I think that both articles are right. <br><br>But the real factor is not how many decisions one makes, but how stressful those decisions are. Decisions for a CEO or a judge, where millions of dollars or someone's life and liberty are involved are by their very nature stressful. Deciding what model car to buy or whether to read one's mail or call a contact next are only stressful if you let them be stressful. <br><br>The advice given by Darius Foroux is good. Stress is related to how large a decision is and how long you have put off making the decision. So it makes sense to make a lot of small decisions without putting them off. <br><br>He says "I often say that there are no right or wrong decisions — only decisions." <br><br>I prefer to say "There are no right or wrong decisions - only different consequences".</div>

<div class="content">Cricket:<br><br><< And not deciding is a form of decision. >><br><br>There is however a difference between not getting around to doing anything about something and deciding not to do anything about something.<br><br>The consequences may be the same as far as the "something" is concerned. But they are very different as far as you are concerned. Not getting round to doing something confirms you in your laziness and indecision. Deciding to do nothing confirms and trains you in making decisions.</div>
