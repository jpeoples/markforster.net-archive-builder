<div class="content">How do people keep and organize the dreams items?<br>I believe it's future vision, current reality, what's better log and that's it. <br>Are these in a notebook, scrap of paper, wall, headspace?  Do you keep record, or just present stuff?</div>

<div class="content">I've been using Evernote to record and list these items, following Mark's own setup quite closely. I record the newest entries above the older ones.</div>

<div class="content">I have my present and future reality organized into a mindmap.<br><br>Old visions are archived by date in old branches.<br><br>The what's better list is a pen and paper notebook that I write in every night before bed. Which reminds me, I haven't reviewed my what's better list in a while.</div>

<div class="content">So inspiring... there's some people still doing this. I wish we could turn this into some form of weeky or monthly support skype call, or email support. Thoughts?</div>

<div class="content">What's Better list goes into a Moleskine daily planner (only use I could find for it)<br><br>The 'reality checks' are in a Google Doc I can get to from work or home.<br><br>I do the dialoguing exercises in 750words.com as my daily writing exercise, and then in a text file as needed. i find I don't need to keep them, just need to do the process.</div>

<div class="content">I just type all mine into text files. I save them as RTF so that I can use basic formatting such as putting each new date in bold. I open these files in TextEdit on a Mac. On Windows, the corresponding application would be WordPad, I think--like NotePad, but allowing simple formatting.<br><br>What's Better List is in "What's Better.rtf" and I add to it at the top each evening. My dashboard (printed page with essential daily info) has an empty space where I can jot What's Better items any time, but often I don't write anything down in advance.<br><br>Future Vision and Present Reality are in Vision.rtf, which I edit about once a week. I open a new blank window alongside, so I can see the main document and the new window, and I retype the content into the new window, editing as I go. When done, I paste all the new stuff into the top of the main document and throw away the spare window.<br><br>Q&A is in Dialog.rtf, which I haven't touched in a while, though I used to add to it daily. All this entails is typing the new date at the top and then free-writing the new Q&A session.</div>

<div class="content">I'm doing roughly the same as Bernie (i.e. text files) but in the simplest plain text format (.txt) and stored in a Dropbox folder so I can access and edit them from anywhere. In all files, the 1st lines have some quotes/tips/hints on what to focus when writing that particular subject and next the most recent entries are always at the top, starting with the day's date.  <br><br>The "What's Better?" file was the first one and started nearly 2 months ago, while still reading the book. I now find that introspecting how the day went (even if for only a couple of minutes) is a very valuable and well established habit, which has survived and resisted through very though changes in my routine (tight deadlines; all-nighters; two jobs; etc.).<br><br>The "Realities" file is now picking up some steam with the FR written in the morning and the PR at night (at the same time as the "What's Better?"). Pretty soon this will move to a Sunday only event. <br><br>The "Dialogs" file hasn't been touched since the odd attempts I made while reading the book. I still haven't grasped this thing of "thinking with my fingers" (i.e. typing my thoughts) but I feel that my recent daily excercises of typing the "Present Reality" have helped a lot in that sense. <br><br>There is also one for the "Exercises" I did at the time of my 2nd reading of the book.</div>

<div class="content"><<The "Dialogs" file hasn't been touched since the odd attempts I made while reading the book>><br><br>Ditto. As well, I found the 2nd half of Dreams a bit of a slog. A month or so ago, Mark discussed updating some of the material. However I think his attention is on a new system, not Dreams 20. As such, I've looked elsewhere to provide some new exercises, etc., to bolster the Dreams process. I'm reading/listening to some of Michael Neill's material. His attempts to bolster the efficacy of coaching (by taking swipes at therapy) make me wonder about his material in general. Alas, I'm still searching... <br><br>And yet, I have a 1PM meeting with my drawing tutor tomorrow. So my Future Vision is - oh so slowly - materializing.</div>
