<div class="content">For those of you who use an iPhone: I found a good app for AF2. It's Fasta Finga and comes very close to a paper notebook.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Canta. Do you mean FastFinga? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLiVRe7_Uho" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLiVRe7_Uho</a><br><br>It looks more like a journal software to me. Does it support any form of striking through or marking for done and dismissed tasks?</div>

<div class="content">It's indeed FastFinga. Sorry for my mistake. No it has no option for striking through, that's a disadvantage. But I mark imy items at the beginning with a cross for items that are dismissed, and a circle with a done-sign for items that are done.<br>In the future you can also use different colours for marking.<br><br>Because it's one long list in which you can have differnet pages if you like, because you can easily copy items and because the writing goes fast, I like this app for autofocus2</div>
