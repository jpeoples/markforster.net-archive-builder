<div class="content">I'm really curious to see what the differences between SAF and the Revised AF4 systems are from a user's point of view. Since I don't use them myself, I'd like to know what one system does better then the other and which is best suited for what type of personality...<br><br>Any comments are really welcome!</div>

<div class="content">The new system feels much simpler. With SuperFocus you must think whether a task goes here or there. <br><br>With Af4R it's obvious: if a new/old task is done, you must decide if it's recurring. Over time there will be very few recurring tasks in new, because they are already on the appropriate page. So keep a tab on the Unfinished page and it's easy.<br><br>If you think of recurring stuff as maintenance, it seems a bit like your Kanban system in that you work on one type of task for a while then move on.  <br><br>Me, I now think in terms of my project system, and in that conText, SF is the basis of my project system, and the new AF4R is just an example of one way to apply it.   We will see if it's a good way.</div>

<div class="content">Erik:<br><br>One advantage of the new system is that it's much easier to spot where things are going wrong, and hopefully how to put them right. For instance I've found that I am spending far too much time on recurring tasks - and they badly need auditing (which is on my New Tasks list!)</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>How do you find the new system copes with tasks that would go to column 2 in SAF? I can think of two approaches:<br>1. just start doing them and make an appropriate entry in unfinished or recurring when you stop. possibly add them at the end of the "new" list as crossed off on completion or<br>2. add them at the end of the new list and whip through the lists until you get to them<br><br>I'm just asking out of interest as I plod through SAF.</div>

<div class="content">Will:<br><br>The two main types of task that go in the SAF column 2 are unfinished tasks and urgent tasks.<br><br>Unfinished tasks now have their own page, so you would be concentrating a period of time simply on getting them done. Urgent tasks can be done at any time according to the standard AF rule of "if it needs doing now, do it now".</div>

<div class="content">Auditing and viewing the tasks as different categories is a great plus for sure. My kanban system revolves of that so I can only be in favor :) The main reason for creating this thread might have been answered by Will in the fact that his question is what I wanted to know but didn't know how to express properly; case solved. (and thanks Alan, that's exactly how I see recurring tasks!)<br><br>As for auditing, my system limits what I commit to in the day. So if I have too many recurring things, I might approach it as limiting each activity to less amounts of time each and striking a bargain where everything's not super but passable or give priority to some and not do others. I keep the others though because I'm reminded that I couldn't do them because I had more important stuff at the time... And of course, I can re-evaluate the frequency of the recurring tasks.<br><br>Auditing for AF4R seems more in the realm of weeding tasks out...<br>Are there other good alternatives that I didn't see?</div>
