<div class="content">Are there any plans to offer a PDF of the Autofocus instructions, or at least a printer-friendly web page of the instructions?  When you go to the Autofocus page, you can't even see the beginning of the instructions without scrolling down, due to the translation links and YouTube video.  Printing is unsightly with all the side panels, etc.  I think the simplicity may start to get lost on a busy web page.<br><br>This is just a suggestion to help newcomers.  I still have the original beta email that I reprint from time-to-time, but I feel the main AF page needs a simpler printing method.</div>

<div class="content">Several weeks ago I turned the original instructions into a doc-file that I print whenever I need it. If you need it let me know. Could make it a pdf-file if wanted.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Sounds like a sensible suggestion.<br>Especially for people who use paper notebooks ;-)</div>

<div class="content">I've added a printer-friendly version to the instructions. You can access it direct at:<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2009/1/6/autofocus-system-instructions.html?printerFriendly=true" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2009/1/6/autofocus-system-instructions.html?printerFriendly=true</a></div>

<div class="content">Ah, I had forgotten (or not even realized) that the instructions were a blog post as well.  Very nice!</div>

<div class="content">There seems to be a problem with the "print-friendly" version - in that it won't print properly. I will try to resolve this with Squarespace.</div>

<div class="content">The problem with printing the "print-friendly" version apparently only applied to Firefox. It has now been rectified - so it should now print ok with all browsers.</div>
