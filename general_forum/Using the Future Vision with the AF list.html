<div class="content">I noticed I've stopped doing the Future Vision exercise from Mark's "Dreams" book. As a result the type of entries on my AF list seem to be more reacting to other's demands. Anyone else using the "Dreams" ideas with AF?</div>

<div class="content">Michael - I dig how you're hanging on to "Dreams". Like you, I often wonder how to incorporate some of Mark's ideas from that book into my workflow.</div>

<div class="content">Hi avrum. I really liked the Dreams book. I was pleasantly surprise to see that other coaches use similar approached, which gave the ideas more credibility for me. PS I also liked <a href="http://ow.ly/IuD3J" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://ow.ly/IuD3J</a>  which contained interesting variants of Mark's approach.</div>

<div class="content">Michael - <br><br>Can you give 1 or 2 examples of how you used Dr. Glouberman's ideas? And, if you're willing, to describe if/how you're using them today?</div>

<div class="content">Here's one. She does have a variant of the future vision-current reality exercise in "Dreams". It goes like this. She has "current situation" and "preferred reality" BUT ALSO has "what stands in the way" and "what qualities or attitudes do I need to change or develop" AND she suggests using free drawing with the non-dominant hand to stimulate intuition and creativity. (The drawing is intended to alter the neural pathways). I've found it insightful.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Michael.<br><br>Based on your kudos, as well as a mention (on her website) of Robert Bly appearing in her book, I ordered a copy. I may even splurge for the audio.</div>

<div class="content">Michael - purchased the audio files. So far so good.<br><br>Hey - if you'd like to discuss this further, feel free to email me at avrum AT nadigel DOT com</div>

<div class="content">Best of luck avrum. And thanks for the kind words. I reminded myself that AF is meant to create the vision, so no need for A Future Vision (I suppose Mark might say).:  <br><br>"My vision for Autofocus is that through its unique sifting process we will have our goals and vision clarified for us. Perhaps it would be better to express that as “we will be able to clarify our goals and vision”, because Autofocus is after all no more than a framework to allow our intellect and our intuition to work in balance."<br><br><a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2009/6/12/back-to-autofocus.html#comments" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2009/6/12/back-to-autofocus.html#comments</a></div>

<div class="content">michael:<br><br>Funnily enough I was thinking about this this evening and even read the article you link to before I came across your post.<br><br>Yes, Autofocus (specifically the original one) is supposed to provide a framework for clarifying one's goals and vision.<br><br>It will only do this however if it is worked correctly. Specifically:<br><br>1) Projects can be entered at any level, but should be broken down into small tasks as quickly as possible. So it's best to start a project as "Plan Project X" rather than as just "Project X". The planning consists of breaking down the actions needed for Project X and entering them into the list. Some, or even perhaps most, of these actions will need breaking down further, so they can be entered as planning too, e.g. "Plan Publicity for Project X". This process goes on until you reach a specific concrete action, e.g. "Discuss Publicity for Project X with James".<br><br>2) The aim is to end up with a *lot* of small tasks. I used to think that Seraphim's (and some other people's) giant lists were quite wrong. But they work fine as long as the dismissal process is correctly used.<br><br>3) When you have a long list of say 500 or more tasks, it is essential to be prepared to dismiss a *lot* of tasks - sometimes even a whole page without having done any of the tasks on it. Any attempts to avoid dismissing tasks are fatal to the system.<br><br>4) AF is really a form of survival of the fittest. The tasks which fit your vision (even if you don't know what it is yet) will get done often and well, while other tasks will either languish and eventually get dismissed, or will get dismissed without having been done at all.<br><br>5) Also essential to the process is the review of dismissed tasks. This may lead to reinstatement of a task, but what is often forgotten is that it may also lead to final deletion of a task.<br><br>It's not quite relevant to the present discussion but another thing I would want to stress about AF is that "If it needs doing now, do it now" is part of the system, not a failure of the system.</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br>It's maddening how good AF (and most of your ideas) sound. The practice is another matter entirely. I'm assuming it's the discipline that I lack - the wherewithal to stick to the list, to not abandon the rules when things become mundane, boring, etc. <br><br>Again, in theory (and moving pictures <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF1ngJAyD_s" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF1ngJAyD_s</a> ) it speaks to me on a practical, even spiritual level. <br><br>But the practice man, the practice...</div>

(A common Kanban practice is to set rules such as "WIP limits" or "forward motion only", but instead of enforcing all these rules strictly, one does what makes sense at the time, and if a rule violation occurs, it should trigger a review to think about why the violation was necessary, and how to improve the organization of the process and flow so as to make similar violations unnecessary in the future).<br><br>A deeper review of dismissed items could be something more like this:<br><br>- Why do I keep dismissing tasks that my rational mind says are "important"?  What's the disconnect there?<br><br>- Am I dismissing too many of the small tasks connected with various projects, causing multiple projects to stall and none to be completed?   Is this a sign I have taken on too many commitments?<br><br>Stuff like that.  I'm pretty sure this kind of deeper reflection is what Mark had in mind all along, but I never got in the habit of taking review of dismissed items seriously enough to make it work like this.<br><br>It almost makes me want to try AF1 again as my main system.  :-)    But actually, this is essentially what I'm doing with DIT right now.   If I fall behind, I don't just do an audit of commitments, but have been asking myself these same kinds of questions, in conjunction with reviewing my "DONE" lists for the day, and it's been really helpful.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim<br><br><<Why do I keep dismissing tasks that my rational mind says are "important"? What's the disconnect there?>><br><br>An excellent question. If I were a programmer, and creating a piece of software to implement AF, I would code a feature whereby the user would need to answer 1 (of 3) questions before re-entering a dismissed task.</div>

The problems come when for one reason or another I feel I want to change things. So for instance I come to a page which contains a lot of tasks I really don't want to do. The result is that I can't face even starting on the page. Result:  I go off and try another system - or stop working altogether.<br><br>What I should have done of course was simply calmly scan down the page item by item according to the rules and if something stood out I should have worked on it and if nothing stood out I should have dismissed the entire page, again according to the rules. <br><br>Nothing difficult about that - the system would still be intact and my resistance to the page would have been irrelevant.</div>

In one case, a person who is meditating gets frustrated because their mind keeps wandering.

<div class="content"><<or is it just our way our minds work?>><br><br>I think there are people that - for whatever reason - are able to "stay on the horse" longer than others. In the GTD world, there's Tim Stringer & Kourosh Dini, both use Omnifocus and practice GTD - and have done so for years. At the other end of the spectrum, there is Dave Seah who is constantly reinventing his workflow, productivity sheets and thinking, yet still produces very impressive work. <br><br>Whatever works - I guess.</div>

There are people who start [meditation] and do it for a lifetime and others who start it and give it up after a few weeks. Substitute any activity you like for meditation, the same will be true.</div>

Sometimes by taking on MORE work, it forces me to get more focused and efficient, and I end up getting more done with MORE quality, not less.  And sometimes having just a few things to do on a given day, makes it harder to get into a good stride with the work, and I end the day feeling very unproductive.  It's not a matter of goofing off.   Maybe finding the right balance of challenging work increases "flow" or something.   (I think AF1 is great at inducing "flow").   Maybe Parkinson's Law has some impact here, too.<br><br>DIT is also good at helping me get more out of the same amount of time.  It helps me push forward to finish the list by the end of my workday.<br><br>I guess the observation I am trying to describe is this:   spending more time on a task does not necessarily increase the quality of the result.   Stopping when additional work adds little or no value is a very useful skill that both AF1 and DIT have helped me learn.</div>

<div class="content">Perhaps there is a "current vision" which is not being expressed today, in the moment - an untapped potential, inspired by ...some aspect of us. The expression of virtue. The inspiration of our conscience.</div>

<div class="content">I think it works like this: the procrastination comes from a feeling of being intimidated by the next step because it is too big.The planning process increases discernment and brings clarity over which step we are on with a project. A super-easy next step allows a sense of accomplishment, building motivation.</div>
