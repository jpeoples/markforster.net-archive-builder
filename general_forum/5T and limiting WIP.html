<div class="content">Putting a limit on WIP (work-in-process) is a fundamental element of Agile and Lean workflows, such as Scrum and Personal Kanban.   It has so many benefits:<br>- Reduced task switching<br>- Increased focus<br>- Fewer backlogs<br>- Things get done faster<br>- Helps identify bottlenecks<br>- Keeps work flowing smoothly<br>- Etc.<br><br>I am noticing that 5T has a similar effect.   I am beginning to think one of the big reasons 5T works so well is that 5T is a simple and effective means to limit WIP – and keep WIP limited to the things that are top-of-mind – cutting out everything else (at least temporarily).<br><br>Catch-all lists, on the other hand can theoretically keep EVERYTHING in a state of WIP.   Every item on the list is a candidate for imminent action, depending on the particulars of the specific system you are following.   With AF1 or FVP, I could theoretically have 100 or more tasks and projects going at once.</div>

<div class="content">I am using a "catch all" system right now, SFv3, and it is becoming clear to me that my failures before with Mark Forster's other systems was that I was not being strict with the dismissal process and focusing on too many hard tasks and projects at a time.  However, these were cured by having a few weeks with a no-list system.</div>

<div class="content">Mark Forster: Probably you should make a blog post about the positive effects of having a go with No List systems for a week or so then :)</div>
