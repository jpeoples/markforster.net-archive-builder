<div class="content">I came across this article recently and I felt it captured the problem of life management pretty well and gave an interesting solution. I haven't tried it myself but I wanted to share it and also see if anyone here has come across it or tried it before.<br><br>https://stephenguise.com/this-easy-life-management-system-will-make-you-happier-freer-and-twice-as-productive/<br><br>By the way, two months ago, in a comment on his YouTube video explaining it, he said he's since created a "better" system which he plans to detail in a new book.</div>

<div class="content">My honest assessment is that it's getting at some of the key issues, but I do feel that the author probably will end up refining this system a bit more in the future, as the current approach that was presented didn't feel to me to have all of the refinement of a system that has been honed for a while.</div>

<div class="content">It seems similar to my “Sooner or Later” practice.  We both set the days tasks with reference to a selection of goals and proposed actions, and there’s the same emphasis on choosing based on predilection rather than prior compulsion. I do agree it seems at a glance to be loosely defined, and Charles does say the new book has a refinement.</div>
