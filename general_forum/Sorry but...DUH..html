<div class="content">I'm not saying that this is "just" a to-do list at all, but, in the end, it IS a to-do list - you cannot get away from that fact.</div>

<div class="content">Actually there are quite a lot of differences. For example to-do lists are open lists, whereas AF is a series of closed lists, and that is absolutely key to how it works. Moreover with a to-do list you are committed to trying to do everything on it, which is one reason why such lists are problematic. One thing AF does, in surprisingly subtle ways, is effortlessly scaffold reviews of exactly what it is you need to do next in relation to any action, and helping you determine whether this is something you really want or need to be doing at all. <br><br>Calling it a to-list is therefore inaccurate: it's not one list, and it is not a list of things you are committed to doing. It's more like a series of lists of candidate actions. Moreover it is more than a list, whatever name you give to it; it's a process of working with a series of closed lists. <br><br>I wonder if those who are trying to be so dismissive of the system have actually tried it, carefully following the original instructions? It's the structure of the lists and the process of working with them that many are finding so powerful, and nothing at all like to-do lists.</div>

<div class="content">Simon H:<br><br>AF is definitely worth a whirl if you liked DIT.  DIT transformed my productivity - I started in Jan 08 and used it for a whole year (I can't say I did that with any other method I tried).  AF took that to a whole new level.<br><br>It keeps a lot of the good things of DIT.  A buffer between stimulus and response. Little and often.  Limiting the choice of what to work on.  One thing at a time.  <br><br>It also fixes many of the problems (that I had) with DIT - as I constantly built up a backlog during busy periods where we were running full day events.  In AF little and often you may achieve in a day what took 3 or 4 days in DIT.<br><br>AF is like DIT on steroids - similar feeling and concepts just far more efficient (for me).<br><br>And I completely agree with you it IS a to-do list - at it's simplest it's a list of ALL the things I have to get done.  AF is just a very efficient and effective method for processing that list.  AF is not about the list - It's about how you direct your attention and effort.</div>

<div class="content">hey, i'm going to probably drop participation from now on, but i just want to point out why both the top comment on this topic and my own (and perhaps other critical comments that i haven't seen) maybe should be taken into account a little more. granted, maybe the top comment here wasn't terribly constructive. but blowing it off as rooted in ignorance, i think, amounts to some arrogance on the part of those who consider it worthwhile to defend the system. some points to illustrate:<br><br>1. whenever people say 'this system has nothing useful to offer me,' the answer is generally, 'go back and read the directions.' this is a hand-waving answer. <br><br>2. if the answer gets more sophisticated, it is to the effect if isaac's, which makes distinctions between 'open' and 'closed' lists, and whether or not the list carries the obligation to complete everything on it. this is a defense against a straw man: these are very specific, idiosyncratic criteria that have been pasted onto the everyday conception of a to-do list, which is much more generic. what i call a to-do list is generally a set of reminders of things to do so i don't forget; that's about the long and short of it. and i think that's a pretty common definition.<br><br>Why point this out at all? Because I think there is something a bit disingenuous in the premise of the 'system': that its rules ('scaffolded reviews') are a useful way to get in touch with the intuitive side of choosing a task. What I read from the directions (which I have read carefully, and implemented) is an attempt to systematize something that is much better left outside the system - call it 'intuition.' We make systems when we want rules to help us structure things. When the rules say 'pick the thing on the list that jumps out at you,' that is pushing you back into a discretionary approach that would have existed whether or not you were trying to implement a system called 'autofocus.' <br><br>So, maybe instead of dismissing all of the critics as 'trolls' who didn't bother to think about it, consider the possibility that the subtlety you're aiming for in this is actually something that, by its very nature, cannot be systematized. It's like Lewis Carroll's dialogue between the Tortoise and Achilles: you want to systematize something that in its essence lies above the system you're talking about. In Carroll's case, the Tortoise pointed out that you can't represent the process of inference inside of an argument that relies on inference to be true. Similarly, for Autofocus, I don't really think you can formalize a step saying "Here's how to be intuitive," and make that the heart of a SYSTEM, i.e. an orderly set of rules and processes for handling work.<br><br>Finally, when taken from that perspective, maybe you can see why some people feel a little insulted when you blow them off and say they don't see your wonderful system for the "Rolls Royce" that you think it is.</div>

<div class="content">While I personally still struggle to make AF work for me (i.e. in my job; it seems to work at home, but then, I only had 2 or 3 days to use it there), I still think that it should work for many people in their work life. And I still feel drawn to it, even though I keep falling off the wagon in my workplace. <br><br>Why I think it works: AF seems to turn your to-do list into a game. It's easy to 'score' points with the 'little and often' principle, and that's what sets the whole list in motion. <br><br>If you follow the idea that AF is basically a game, it's easy to see how intuition and emotions can come into play (!), even though every game is based on rules.</div>

<div class="content">I just found this yesterday on LifeHacker and (having an empty Moleskin handy) started using AF right away.  After several hours of off and on doing a brain dump, I felt a lot more relaxed - more relaxed than when writing a traditional to do list because I didn't have to try to decide if I could get my list down in a day.  I kept remembering nagging details and I kept writing.<br><br>I went home for lunch and knocked out a few things on my list (this was my home to do list.)  By the time I headed back to work, I felt even better.<br><br>I continued to remember things - many important things - and threw them at the list as they came to me.<br><br>The pace continued to slow but the importance of things recalled and captured seemed more and more important.<br><br>This morning I woke, reviewed my list and circled something that was time sensitive and very important to me.  I didn't have anything else to throw at my (now quite long) list.<br><br>I had an intensive day of meetings at work (and by now I had begun a work AF list.)  I was able to concentrate and perform at work at the highest level.  No nagging details about my home and family were dragging me down.  I've tried other systems but I stressed as much about how to use the system as I did over the things I was trying to capture.  I have tried and tried to implement GTD but never really "got it". <br><br>I did have to tweak how I use AF just a little because I have such a backlog - that's okay!  I'm sure I'll be caught up soon.  This works and is so different than a "to do" list.  My tweak is that I scan the entire list to make sure there is nothing extremely urgent or important.  I found one such item and drew a flower beside it.  It will get done first thing in the morning.<br><br>The only challenge I see coming up is transitioning from one filled Moleskin to a new one.  I can see carrying around two home notebooks for a short amount of time.  It will probably push me to accomplish more during the transition period.<br><br>I love the way the system sorts the tasks and lets me use my intuition.  I spent more time with other systems managing the system (after I invested tons of time trying to learn the system.  In that respect GTD was the worst.  What really hurt was that I realized where the author was going with the concept but I couldn't implement it.  I just couldn't get there.)<br><br>The beauty of AF is that you just start using it.  It becomes richer and better the very next day.  I am genuinely excited about my list now because now it serves me.<br><br>The only real downside I can see is that I might lose my notebook.  But if I did, I'm sure I would manage the loss the same way as I began the system - I'd grab a new notebook and just begin the recall.  <br><br>Thanks Mark for sharing this.  I have no doubt in my mind that I'll be just as enthusiastic a month or two from now!!</div>

<div class="content">Sorry to post so much but the only other thing I need now with my AF Home list is a small calendar to tuck inside the notebook - just for all the obvious reasons.  <br><br>This is so simple and elegant I can't believe I never thought of it myself!  I'm actually going to toss the planners I've tried to use at home - I'm that confident that this is it!</div>

<div class="content">With respect, a mathematical system trying to prove a rule it depends on is just a tad different than a human "system" which tells you which human "functions" to use to carry out the goal of living.<br><br>IOW, it is perfectly reasonable to set up "rules" which apply to the total system and have one of those "rules" be that you do not apply rules to selection of the items (except to select one intuitively).  Or maybe better put ... the rule applied to the selection of the items is that one looks to one's intuition, which is a subconscious process and so one which operates by its own set of rules.  Though it does not really matter because in the end we are all just trying to get the laundry folded!<br><br>Humans are not mathematical systems of rules which must be entirely consistent or they cease working.  Our strength lies precisely in our ability to know when to follow rules and when to step outside of the box and look for alternative ways of processing.<br><br>As to blowing someone off, I think that the reaction was born of bad manners and hostility and general lack of netiquite.  And, with all of that, the "blow off" was rather gentle, I think.<br><br>As to the "follow the instructions" response, I think that is really very valid.  Most people who have trouble precede their query with: "I've read the instructions, have not tried them, but I can't see how they would work."  Well, I guess that speaks for itself.  Anyone really needs to TRY things before commenting ... other than the obvious things like trying suicide before commenting that it is not a good idea ;-)<br><br>AF is a deceptively simple system yet it is actually complex in the instructions.  Speaking personally, I could not understand the instructions until I drew a flow chart and then after I was sure I understood it and implemented it ... I found that I was doing something wrong.  With respect to Mark, those instructions just are not that easily followed.  So the only thing one CAN tell a person who is having trouble is to TRY it and then come back with a specific sticking point ... not a general criticism of the whole process because it is just a TODO list.<br><br>As to your general take on it all, I agree.  It is important to listen to problems and not blow people off ... but I don't think that is what happens here.  People here bend over backward trying to help each other.  We all get out of bed on the wrong side, from time to time, but damn, I don't think you will find a more congenial group anywhere!</div>

<div class="content">skeptic:  You say that AF is intuitive.  For me, it is not completely intuitive as intuition requires some sort of background on which to make decisions.  Is it intuitive that the Earth orbits the Sun?  Not until you understand contemporary physics.  But let's not digress.<br><br>  My personal experience with traditional to-do lists, is:<br>a.  Make a list<br>b.  Go down the list and work on them.<br>c.  Cross off when task is finished.<br>d.  Be stressed out from having the list stay unchanged at the end of the day.<br><br>For myself, the breakthroughs are:<br> 1.  It's okay to skip around.<br> 2.  It's okay to cross it off, even if the task is not complete.<br><br>It's psychologically reassuring that someone(s) has the same idea.  Yes, for me it was also intuitive to go though my list in the AF manner.  There was also the traditional to-do list paradigm nagging me that it was wrong. <br><br>I also don't know what a open list or closed list is.  I don't really care.  It sounds like marketing-speak to me.<br><br>Also, I don't trust the system yet.  It's not one-size-fits-all and in the end may not work for me.  Be it GTD, DIT, AF, 4Q, etc, it's easier to learn about what others are doing and pull from their experiences than try to intuit everything on one's own.<br><br><br>Next time, perhaps you should say "I've been doing this for years, here are some suggestions from someone who has much more experience."</div>

<div class="content">skeptic<br><br>Hope you do still come back and visit the site. This is a great site where people will do their best to help eachother and, when you see the totally offensive nature of some comments on other sites, it is good to know that such behaviour will not be tolerated here because "the community" as it were simply will not respond.  "Sid" is perfectly entitled to his opinion and let's face it, if one of our friends had said the same thing to us directly, we would have taken the time to correct them but would have been unlikely to take real offence.  Yes, the comment did to a degree breach netiquette, but everyone is entitled to their opinion and no-one is saying otherwise. Truly offensive comments will, I have no doubt, be ignored and taken down in due course, but no-one wants to restrict freedom of speech, genuine discussion, or "disallow opposition to the system" in any way.<br><br>I can understand as a newbie to the site how it must look as if the advise to "follow the instructions" is given regularly but, if you read on through the forum you will see why.  It is hard, if not impossible, to explain how AF works, BECAUSE the impact is so difficult to describe.  You can tell someone they will "enjoy" skiing, but unless they try for themselves, take the time to learn the techniques, and get past the early spills, they will never experience that exhiliaration and will forever consider you to be an absolute idiot for strapping a couple of pieces of wood to your feet and sliding down a mountain!<br><br>The fact is that AF has an effect beyond that which can be explained in the instructions.  It is therefore more than a little frustrating when someone continues to criticise something without trying it, or without even the willingness to give it a go.  Sure, it may well not work for everyone. Sure, some people will just decide it is not for them - regardless.  That is everyone's right to choose.  I firmly believe that anyone who takes the time, and puts in the effort, to learn to ski will of course enjoy it and that by not doing so they are missing something amazing.  Does that mean everyone will choose to try? Of course not..  Does that mean that people will not give up, deciding that it is not for them?  Obviously not.  That is individual choice - am I going to harangue them for not carrying on?  Of course not!  But I also expect them to respect my opinions in the same way that I totally respect theirs.</div>

<div class="content">wally<br><br>The principle of open and closed lists is described in a lot of detail in Mark's last book, Do It Tomorrow (DIT).  Basically, the type of "to do" list you describe above, the type that causes you to "Be stressed out from having the list stay unchanged at the end of the day" is an example of an "open list".  It is a list that is continually added to, subtracted from, amended and adjusted, but effectively has no end and therefore can never be completed.  A closed list on the other hand is fixed and cannot be added to, only subtraced therefore from, therefore has the ability to be completed. For example, if (as recommended in DIT) you do a list of all the work that comes in today, to do tomorrow, that list cannot be added to after the end of the day.  <br><br>From a purely practical perspective one type of list can never be completed whereas the other can.  This understandably has a major psycholigical impact as the attempt to complete a standard "to do" list will carry all of the frustrations of a task that can never be achieved.<br><br>Given that the system is so new, none of us have more than a few weeks experience but you may find the following thread helpful in pointing to the questions we have all had along the journey<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/645945" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/645945</a><br><br>Enjoy "the system" :-)</div>

We know the context, the likely effects of our actions, the reactions of our boss or clients, etc, etc - we have our training and our experience in similar situations.

<div class="content">There's been a lot of good discussion here, but I'd like to address a point skeptic made, that (basically) intuition cannot be systematised.<br><br>Consider a triage station at a hospital's emergency department.  While there are some sorts of rules as to who is dealt with first, I think it would be fair to say that there is a decent amount of intuition involved as well.  This doesn't mean that the patients are not systematically dealt with, it just means that the system has to be designed in such a way that the intuition of the triage staff is part of the system.<br><br>I think it's similar with tasks and AF, ultimately it's our own responsibility to be productive members of society.  I would see AF's role in this to provide a system that allows us to deal with our overload of commitments in such a way we get done what we want to get done, and decide not to do the rest.  Or to put it another way, we can work out why we feel we "should" do certain things, why we haven't done them, and whether in fact we should do them at all.<br><br>So I guess what I'm saying is OK, the system is at it's heart, a method for scheduling ones attention.  Looked at that way, it's not that groundbreaking.  But I also bet that if we decided to do a simple queue of tasks instead (always do the oldest first), our resistance will kick in, and the system will fall down.  Same thing would happen if we list everything and just pick tasks at random (just like a traditional todo list).  The brilliance of AF is it provides a way of allocating our attention across a wide number of areas, but without so much system overhead that there is resistance to using it.  And not to be disparaging to AF, but I believe the productivity results we've seen from AF are not inherently from AF itself, but from the fact that people have given attention to things that in some cases have not been given attention in literally years.  In my opinion the most powerful part of AF is that.</div>
