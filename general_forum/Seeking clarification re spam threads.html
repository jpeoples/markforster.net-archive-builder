<div class="content">Mark,  I've seen your advice about not commenting on spam and threads with spam.  Does that mean that if any thread becomes targeted with spam, we should not post any more entries on that thread?  In other words, we should not just ignore the spam, but cut off the thread completely?</div>

<div class="content">No, just ignore the spam. It's easy for me to remove and report a spam posting. But it becomes much more difficult if I've then got to remove a load of non-spam posts commenting on it as well.</div>
