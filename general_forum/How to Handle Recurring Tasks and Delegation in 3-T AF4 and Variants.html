<div class="content">Hi everybody,<br><br>I've been working with this new system of Mark's for a few weeks now and it's been dynamite.<br><br>This is my favourite part.<br> <br>It's so easy to recover from a few days off the system (unlike GTD!) as happens during the holidays.<br> <br>Stress free, I feel like I'm on top of things, but something was nagging at me. There are tasks that aren't really events that have to be done on a certain date, so the calendar is out. However, at the same time, they should be done on a semi-regular basis.<br><br>How to handle those?<br><br>I've got an answer which is working well for me.<br><br><a href="http://ChristophDollis.com/3" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://ChristophDollis.com/3</a><br><br>But I don't want to DO all my tasks. Some, I'd like to give to someone else to do. How to keep track of those?<br><br>I've answered that question for myself as well. I hope you find some of the information here handy, and please keep in mind this is highly specific to my implementation, so if there's something that won't work for you, change it.<br><br><a href="http://ChristophDollis.com/3" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://ChristophDollis.com/3</a><br><br>Happy New Year!<br><br>Cheers (too bad we can't do this over a glass of something delicious),<br><br>Christoph<br><br>P.S. I included a some ideas I had for handing email, computer files, incoming paper and the like, using Mark's principles and structure.</div>

<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>I like your use of tags, Christoph.  I think I will add another tag to the growing number of tags in my own AF ^___^ However, isn't your system a bit heavy in overhead maintenance for it to work properly? I mean you have multiple entry points: paper, computer, email. etc.  Don't you get, I don't know, confused?<br><br>Happy New Year and God bless!</div>

<div class="content">Nah.<br><br>I have to use those other "entry points" anyway. I'm simply using similar rules to handle these different contexts to REDUCE the amount of thinking "overhead" required.<br><br>It looks complex to write down step by step. It's actually easy to use.<br><br>Thanks for your blessing!</div>
