<div class="content">This week Staples has spiral notebooks for only a penny in the stores.  Don't think the offer is available on-line.  Limit is 6 but additional ones are only 15 cents.<br><br>With a rebate a ream of paper is only a penny as well.  Limit 2.<br><br>I know some of you are still keeping it simple, so I thought I would pass on about the notebooks.  The only down side is that only wide rule notebooks are on sale.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, I also saw the ad.  Back to school time is great for paper based time management fans.  Lots of cheap spiral notebooks and composition books to be had.  You can get a years worth of supplies really cheap.<br><br>Gerry</div>
