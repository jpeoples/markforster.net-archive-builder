<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">On 23 Oct, Mark Forster wrote "Anyone like to guess which it might be? All will be revealed soon."<br><br>The suspense is killing me. What a tease!<br><br>I'm still pretty happy with WM (DWM using weekly pages instead of daily ones), and have seriously tried AF1 and AF4. Read DIT but never really tried using that older system. GTD was a good primer but not enough fun. I am also trying out the Unschedule from _The Now Habit_, which is a good way to preview the week and recognize that most days don't really contain a lot of discretionary hours to work whichever system one prefers.<br><br>While waiting for Mark to reveal all, why don't we share which system(s) each of us prefers?</div>

<div class="content">+AJPM+<br><br>AF1 is still my favorite of all of them.  Monstrously simple (so simple, yet able to handle the most monstrous backlogs), its only weakness is its handling of urgent items.  It is only because of that that I am using AF4, but I would go in a heartbeat back to AF1 if the urgency problem is solved.<br><br>God bless.</div>

<div class="content">I liked the "flow" of AF1 best of all, but it couldn't handle my volume of tasks.  The list would grow endlessly, and I'd go for weeks, chasing the end of my list and never cycling through.  <br><br>DWM works best for me.  I'm trying a tweak where I have a few different DWM lists for different areas of focus -- I suppose it's similar to Mark's recommendation to separate "work" and "home", but I'm separating things into 3-5 different areas.  So far it's helping me make sure I don't spend all day working on whatever trivial things happen to stand out -- I'm strictly limiting time spent on miscellany, and focusing on my "hot lists" of things either my manager or my wife are waiting for me to do.</div>

<div class="content">Why does nuntym keep writing "+AJPM+" at the top of every post and comment?  What does it mean? Is it some sort of religious abbreviation? I find this sort of thing irritating, in the same way that Gerry was signing every comment with a link to his site.  If you want to advertise or send secret messages, this doesn't seem like the right way to do it.</div>

<div class="content">ubi:<br><br><< Why does nuntym keep writing "+AJPM+" at the top of every post and comment?  >><br><br>It stands for the Latin "ad Jesum per Mariam" (to Jesus through Mary) and is something that some Catholics (not me!) write at the beginning of written communications. It's similar to the way Muslims when writing a formal letter will put "Bismillah ar-rahman ar-raheem" (in the name of God the compassionate the merciful) at the top.</div>

<div class="content">+Ad Iesum Per Mariam+<br><br>Ubi,<br><br>Placing "+AJPM+" on the top of as many of my written communications as possible is part of my personal promise when I made my consecration.  Jesuits place "+AMDG+" (Ad Maiorem Dei Gloriam, or For The Greater Glory of God)  to most of theirs, so I didn't see any harm to doing it. Sorry if it's irritating, but I am doing it for no one but the Lord. But as a concession I will start placing it on in full.<br><br>However, if the forum admin (Mark) feels it is too much, then I will obey and remove it altogether.<br><br>God bless.</div>

<div class="content">Mark & nuntym,<br><br>Thanks for the explanation. The abbreviation (or spelled-out) preface is much less irritating now that I know what it means, even though I'm not religious.</div>

<div class="content">Off topic maybe, but to me a vinidcation of the login policy which makes all interchanges more civilised and productive, now that Norman stormed off and others of his ilk are excluded.<br><br>However, I do miss 'learning as I go', is she ok or not registered yet?  Her enthusiasm buubles over her daily trials, a lesson to many others including moi.<br><br>nuntym and ubi: thanks for sorting this out, looks like  a positive and honest outcome!.<br><br>Back on topic: I'm still using AF4 with a DWM blend, however I have returned to certain AF1 habits from the early and heady days of January 2009 to monitor things.</div>

<div class="content">@Alan: AF1 'habits', not practices or procedures.  In this case, I now again highlight completed tasks in green, deferred or unfinished in yellow.<br><br>@Mark: I know, but the effect is still pleasing, although I hope you never have to ban anyone other than for spamming!</div>

<div class="content">Actually Mark inspired me to give AF1 a try again (was using DWM before) and so far I like it. And Mark's other invention, the long-list DWM, would allow to switch back quite easily (the high number of half-empty pages in DWM was annoying me a bit).</div>

<div class="content">Good idea Roger. I'm going to try this highlighting.</div>

<div class="content">Alan: I strike through with a black straight line (gel pen) as soon as I have done the task, or put an arrow on it to defer it (mainly due to context or physical location).<br><br>During review sessions, I highlight the completed ones in green (and the cancelled, can't-be-bothered to do it, dismissed tasks which have a black wavy line) and the deferred tasks in yellow.<br><br>Strangely, I find during reviews that the UNhighlighted tasks DO stand out, maybe because of a hopefully increasing green 'lawn' growing on the pages.  Other users may find the highlighting gets in the way somehow, but it works for me and that's what is important, for me.<br><br>I'm toying with marking Dismissed for Review in orange, but I do not want too many colours on a page.<br><br>I also use a Moleskine pocket book to cull MITs, 'Threes' or similar priority tasks from my AF lists every day.  Work tasks are listed from the top, Personal from the bottom up, planned Errands go in between along with any other tasks done (like 'below the line'?) or short notes eg email address, tel number, whatever.  I apply the same highlighting rules and strive for a green only appearance at the end of the day, but not always successfully.<br><br>Thanks to nuntym and others, I keep maintenance tasks separate, located in Outlook and which come up three times during the day, eg check email, return calls, review AF.<br><br>Note to Mark: would it be possible to enable us to have draft text in posts in variable sizes ie in the 'box', but keep them as they are displayed now when posted?  Even with an 19" external monitor, I struggle with the current small text size in drafts, a sign of my times (63).</div>

<div class="content">Remember "The thing you resist most is the thing you should work on"? I'm really resisting limiting my current list to three things, with the result that I have many projects that are at "highest mess" stage but aren't progressing.<br><br>I need to modify my system so those three stay front-and-centre.</div>

<div class="content">Roger J:<br><br><< would it be possible to enable us to have draft text in posts in variable sizes ie in the 'box', but keep them as they are displayed now when posted? >><br><br>Sorry, I don't think that's possible within the Squarespace system. However you can increase the text size for the whole page by holding down CTRL and pressing + (plus) as many times as necessary. You reverse the process by holding down CTRL and pressing - (minus) as many times as necessary. This works on most browsers.</div>
