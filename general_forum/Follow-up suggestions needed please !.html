<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-04-9 16:44</div>
<div class="content">To preface, I'm using a very non-powerful email system here at my work which is not connected to a calendar and is limited in other respect in comparison to Outlook (eg. tags are only by colour and I find that disorienting).<br><br>I'm also in an environment where things don't get done just because you request them to be done, so I have to follow up a lot, something I have never had to do before, so I'm not sure how to approach it.  <br><br>I had set up a ".Follow up" folder in my email, but it was becoming too large (and I like things organized into subfolders).  So, what I've done is to make sub-folders within that folder based on months (eg. 05-May followup) as well as a folder for a specific department who is in need of constant monitoring.  <br><br>I also started cc'ing myself on the emails where I have thought I might have to follow up on things and set a rule where I have a cc to myself that it goes into the general follow-up folder.  <br><br>For the department who needs constant monitoring, I will pick up the phone or arrange a face to face meeting once a week to see where they're at, making a list of what I think needs to be done that hasn't been done so we can go through it together.  <br><br>And w.r.t. the AF list, I was writing F-U for Follow-Up in the left margin, but the letters hold a different connotation generally in my mind, so I don't really want to see that all over my page. :-)   I don't want to write a new task to follow up on my original request, but maybe that's the answer.  I can see my list quickly getting clogged up with follow-ups however (ie 6-7 per day).  <br><br>Does anyone else have or ever have had this kind of issue, and what did you do to facilitate follow-up?  Like I said, I'm totally new to this and I hate things falling through the cracks.<br><br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br><br>This is where I would use separate lists in OneNote (but whatever system suits).  For me all follow up or pending email gets filed in a separate email folder just called AutoFocus and referenced for action within AF but given the volume you describe I would have a separate section in OneNote with a tab (separate list) for each person/department and list the items as a follow up reminder system.<br><br>Personally I would populate those lists from AF and add a regular task to "action follow-ups" .  So, if I sent an email to Fred requiring a response I would add a task "add dd/mm email to Fred to follow up list"  Adding the note to the list would enable the task to be crossed of my AF list.  When I hit the recurring item "check follow up lists" I would then cross off anything on those lists already actioned and follow up whichever were appropriate. In effect those lists would be my "Follow Up" Project Management System, enabling me to see status on any given person or department without trawling through many AF pages.</div>

<div class="content">Christine, I like the idea of adding the task to "action follow-ups".   I was thinking of adding a regular meeting into my calendar, but this will come around in a more natural way on a timely basis.<br><br>Would my description of my sub-folders in my email operate similarly to how you describe OneNote?  I'm not going to add any other system, I'm not techie-oriented like you are (except accounting systems, oh, I love accounting systems - and excel). :-)  <br><br>I don't understand the second part w.r.t. Fred, would I be putting a separate page or pages into my AF book too for follow-ups so they're in one place?  <br>eg. page titled "follow up with PHAS department" and list everything on there including email and other incoming info.  I could refer to the email in my ".PHAS followup" subfolder.  Part of the issue is that the .PHAS department problems stem from email, but if I pick up the phone and call, I can usually light a fire under him.<br><br>Thanks so much for your help!</div>

<div class="content">The arrow is what I used to use for years for a "Brought Forward" item.  (Franklin Planner days).<br><br>Exciting stuff here too... applicable to any system, esp. AF:<br><br><a href="http://wiki.43folders.com/index.php/Moleskine/Hacks" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.43folders.com/index.php/Moleskine/Hacks</a><br><br>  Darn it, smileypete, I wasn't supposed to surf today (surf free Thursday)!  Just ask my question, and get off the web...<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br><br>Yes, I think your email folders would work in just the same way.  Personally I would create the folders by person/department as opposed to date, for the simple reason that you are following up with a person/department and that would seem to be the best way of keeping group actionable tasks together.  Besides, I get the impression that having folder with a date will gradually irritate you more the older it gets and as you are limited in controlling the other party then why allow a further annoyance :-)<br><br>If I was using a list based system to manage my "follow up" project then those lists would be outside AF(eg in OneNote), but populated from AF ("add email etc") and followed up from AF by the "action follow ups" task.  If I was just using email folders then I would just move them to the folder and action by a "action follow ups" task without any particular notation in AF.  It would all depend on whether I felt a separate list was necessary which in this case I would probably prefer, but that would purely be personal preference. (It somehow carries more weight when discussing with someone who is habitually slow to respond to have a specific list!)  Depending on the email system you could probably produce a printed list by means of a screen print of the expanded email folder. <br><br>Hope that helps?</div>

<div class="content">Christine, I'm doing the date as an email tickler file of sorts.  It's indicating that everything in there should be cleared up for that month-end (it's an accounting thing).  In theory, by the end of May, the May follow-ups should be resolved - or if absolutely necessary, carried forward to June. Then I would delete the May folder.  Makes more sense?</div>

<div class="content">The standard way of following up with AF is to put "Jim called back?" or "Jane replied?" or whatever. As you scan the list, you can get a good idea of what follow-up has been done or needs doing. <br><br>Another method which was suggested on this forum is that every time you send an email which requires a response you put a code such as [w] (for "waiting") in the email and write a rule which sends a copy to a special "Waiting" folder. You can also write a rule that brings up the reply to your attention. I find this works extremely well. By looking at the folder on a regular basis you can see which emails are still awaiting replies.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br><br>I was reading your 05-May as May 5th so yes that makes sense :-)<br><br>Mark is of course correct re the standard way of handling follow ups.  I get the impression though that this is a bigger issue than "standard" hence my "turn it into a project" suggestion - although of course as you have such an unreasonably small number of pages ................ I'll run now before you throw something :-)</div>

<div class="content">Mark, I am cc'ing myself on everything to do with this department and some other things that I don't feel will come about just with a request and no follow up.  And those cc's go straight into a separate file on my email (.Followup) where they get sorted according to the appropriate category from there.   I'm also learning that although email is faster, I'm better off picking up the phone, or if things get really bad, paying a personal visit... :-)  It takes more time, but it gets results.<br><br>Christine - careful, or I'll throw the book at you!  If you count the 2 books together, I'm now up to a whopping 13 active pages!  Not that I couldn't polish off 4 or 5 pages in my work book in a day if I wanted to.... :-)  <br><br>You're right Christine, it's localized in one particular group - really in one person - fortunately, he's supposedly looking for another job...</div>

<div class="content">No, no - not the book ..........!!! 13 pages - pah! :-)<br><br>It's never an easy scenario when you try to bring order into a situation where happy inefficiency has been the order of the day.  You find that half the people will try to get you to do everything and the other half hide behind a cupboard when they see you coming!  The personal visit option does work best tho' - best of luck .......:-)</div>

<div class="content">I put all my emails into related project folders (related to a project) or reference folders (everything else that needs to be kept).<br><br>If the email requires some action, then I apply a red-colored flag before I move it to the folder.   <br><br>If the email requires follow-up, then I apply a blue-colored flag before I move it.<br><br>I already check most of these project folders regularly (i.e., the project is already entered into AF) and clear out all the flagged items (taking action on reds, initiating follow-up on blues).  <br><br>If I'm not sure that the folder is already in AF, then I'll add "Check Project X" or "Check Reference Y" to AF.<br><br>After I take action, I remove the flag.<br><br>Works great.  It keeps everything where it's supposed to be.  And it organizes action by project, not by whether or not I need to follow up, etc.  I.e., I am clearing all emails related to Project A at one time, rather than doing all my follow-ups, regardless of project, at one time.<br><br>The only thing this process requires is email folders, and some kind of label or flagging functionality.  You can do it in Gmail, too, with the optional star feature (many kinds of stars).</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim's system is extremely easy to implement in NEO  ( <a href="http://www.caelo.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.caelo.com</a> ) which is the email management system I consistently recommend - and you don't even have to open any Outlook folders to do so!</div>

<div class="content">Just wanted to update that my followup system is working well now, I've got my .Followup (dept) folders and have started to put my email related tasks on my AF list - work has slowed down and I feel I have the time to manage things properly now.</div>

<div class="content">I rather like www.memotome.com.  It allows you to put in reminders and then the site sends you e-mails at the appointed times/dates.  Its free and easy to use.  I use it for birthdays, anniversaries and for one off reminders.  If you keep the site open all the it reduces the barrier to setting a follow up.</div>
