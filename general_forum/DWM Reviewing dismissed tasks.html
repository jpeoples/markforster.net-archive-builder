<div class="content">Hi,<br><br>Since I first read DWM's specification, I wondered why there's no reviewing, like AF1's.<br><br>Lately I've been quite lazy with the list, and let several tasks die. I'm fine with that, sometimes even happy to see things vanish, even if they are important.<br><br>But I suspect that I'm abusing the method: I don't do things that bother me, because if I let them alone for a month, they'll just go away, I won't see them again.<br><br>I don't know if Mark purposely excluded this from DWM, or if the specifications aren't final, but I think I'm going to do some reviewing from time to time. Rephrasing/spitting a task was quite effective with AF.<br><br>I'm using a digital implementation, so expired tasks are always there for reviewing.<br><br>Thoughts?</div>

<div class="content">I put a task for "review expired tasks" on the +30 page and do it sometime during the month when it stands out</div>

<div class="content">I do the same as Lilian.  That's the beauty of DWM (and all the AF versions) - you can add whatever you want as a task on your list.  Just because Mark hasn't specified something doesn't mean that it's against the rules.  DWM is as creative as you want it to be.  Best of luck with your reviewing, Arthur.</div>

<div class="content">I put my DWM expired tasks on my Someday list, and have "Review Someday list" as one of my task.  While reviewing I'll do (i) readd, (ii) delete, or (ii) leave it as KIV task.</div>

<div class="content">KIV = Keep In View.<br>Meaning not to take any action for the time being, but also not to forget about it.</div>
