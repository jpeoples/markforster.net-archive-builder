<div class="content">Since I am using AF4 extensively now I would like to understand the theory behind it. Why is it so effective for time management and productivity?<br><br>I do have some understanding of the some of the principals involved (e.g. "a little often", "structured procrastination", "intuitive mind vs. rational mind"). However, I would like a more complete understanding of all of the psychological principals that make the system work.<br><br>For instance, why is there an "Active List" and a "Backlog", how does AF4 combine the advantages of both closed lists and open lists, etc?<br><br>Any ideas?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>Mark is really the person to respond but if past is prolog, he won't say too much about the "theory" of it.  But I could be wrong ;-)<br><br>My understanding, based on working with the list is probably a bit simplistic but ...<br><br>- There is an active list because ... well, that is where new things are added ;-)<br><br>- The "backlog" is not actually a "backlog" but a "closed list".  The rules give emphasis to it so that entries on it get priority.  They will have been around longer than things on the active list and so need to get done or get gone.<br><br>- Items on the active list are de-emphasized by rule so that time is spent getting the older things done.  So AF4 gives emphasis to the older items but still allows attention to be placed on the newer ones without the effect of "chasing the end of the list" that we had with previous versions.<br><br>That's about all the theory I see ;-)</div>

<div class="content">The closed list is important because of the psychological effect of seeing progress.  That list can only shrink, and as it does you see that you are moving forward.  Simultaneously you see items that aren't moving forward and the closed list shows you that.  So it's a double incentive: See the progress you're making, AND see the progress you're not making so you can rectify that.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for those ideas. They help me to understand the system better. <br>Does anyone have anything to add?</div>

<div class="content">I don't know if this is really part of the "theory" per se, but for me I can SEE my progress as items get marked as actioned, and that increases motivation.  "Little and often" also has made me feel less guilty about my hummingbird-like work habits.</div>
