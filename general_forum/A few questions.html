<div class="content">Hi,<br>I've been reading and thinking about this method for a few days, and I find it interesting. I intend to try it, but before that, I have a few questions.<br><br>Lets say I have a page with a single undone item. I'm checking my list somewhere, but this task can only be performed when I'm at home/at the gym/at work or any other place.<br>I simply can't perform the task because I'm not there. At the same time, I have no other tasks left in this page. Should I dismiss that task?<br>I know that I can keep more than one list, but here's what confuses me: If I keep a list at work, that means that this list should contain entries related to my job, or does it mean that this is a list that I'll check at work?<br>And if it's the later, for tasks that I can perform both at work and at home, should I repeat them in both lists? I hope not! I'd really want to keep some kind of cohesive list related to one area.<br>Anyway, I doubt that I will keep a separate list for gym or the like :-)<br><br>Second question, but somehow related: I have again a page with a single unchecked item. I can't perform it, because on a previous page, there's another task that this one depends of, still not done. Should I dismiss the later?<br><br>I browsed the forum but couldn't find an answer yet. I hope my English is clear enough (it's not my native language).<br><br>Thanks,<br>Walter<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Walter<br><br>Generally speaking a work list will be for work items and the home list for home items.  Many people (myself included) find it easiest to have one list for all.  With reference to your last items on a page, you should find answers to these in the FAQ's post, link below<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/645945" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/645945</a><br><br>Posts are grouped by subject and you should find what you are looking for.  However, it is actually more confusing to try to work out these things in advance.  I would suggest that you start using the system (try with just one list to start) and see how you get on.  You will probably find the answers as you start working the system.<br><br>Good luck!</div>

<div class="content">IMHO - Don't dismiss the task, just do it at the first available opportunity.  There's no need to be a slave to the system - common sense still rules.<br>I keep 2 notebooks - one for work and one for home - but the one for home, I carry with me to work and occasionally do things in it over lunch.  What I do is flag (I just write a U in the margin) those home items I can do at work (phoning, emailing, buying on-line etc.) - and those become a small subset list of their own while I'm at work so they are all I choose from.  If there weren't any flagged this way on one page, I would skip to the next page with the flags and not dismiss a thing.<br>As time goes on, you will probably find that you change how your write your tasks so that you eliminate the dependency issue and either phrase your item to encompass being able to do either task (because they're likely part of a project of some sort) or you'll stop writing dependent tasks down b/c you've been burned by it before.   But in the meantime, why not do them out of order?  Realize you've learned something about the system and resolve not to do it again... :-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi,<br><br>Ok, I'll try to be a little more flexible. You're right, why should I dismiss a task just because I can't perform it right now, but I will in half an hour? Silly me :-)<br><br>As Christine suggested, I'll just start and learn during the journey.<br><br>Thanks for your kind answers,<br>Walter<br></div>

<div class="content">I have a list of things I can do at work and a list of things I can only do at home. I keep them in the same Circa notebook. I used to have one list but I found my self continually reviewing things at work that I couldn't do because I wasn't at home.</div>

<div class="content">Walter:<br><br>In answer to the three questions you ask:<br><br>1) If you have a page with a single task undone and you are in the wrong place to do it, my recommendation is to dismiss it anyway. The reason is that by the time you get down to one or two items on a page, you will have had mutliple chances to do them. If you haven't done them already, you probably still wouldn't even if you were in the right place.<br><br>2) There can be no standard answer to how many notebooks you need because everyone's circumstances are different. My recommendation is to have one notebook for everything if your circumstances allow it. Bear in mind that it is usually quite a few days before every item on a page is actioned, so that they will get many occasions to be done at the right time.<br><br>3) The task depending on another task: I recommend that this type of task is put into the list with a question mark, e.g. "Consolidate departmental reports?" If the conditions aren't met, then your answer to the question is "No" and you can cross off the task and re-enter it without having to dismiss it.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for replying.<br><br>I'll follow your advice and see how the dynamics of the list develops over the days.<br>I think I somehow have some panic about the dismissing issue :-)<br>But it seems like its a central part of the method.<br><br>I'm hooked. The next few days will be interesting and revealing.<br><br>Thanks again,<br>Walter<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hey Walter, I've dismissed a whole bunch of things, a lot of which I wrote at the beginning when I was doing a brain dump.  About 75% of those I have every intention of doing, but probably not in the next 2-3 months.  I initially had panic about it too, but then I felt a sense of relief at dismissing them (I've got them captured, so they're not going anywhere) - and besides, by dismissing them, I got that much closer to a completed page ! :-)<br></div>
