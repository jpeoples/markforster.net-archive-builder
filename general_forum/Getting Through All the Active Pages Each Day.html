<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">This is my first post. I've been using Autofocus for a couple of weeks now.<br><br>I'm trying to do Autofocus exactly as Mark describes, and not add major tweaks. I think it really works best for me that way. (The few adjustments I've made are very minor, and include the vertical line blocking off completed tasks, and putting a boxed "GS" next to the things that can only be done at my workplace ~ a lot of my work can be done at home.)<br><br>I have found, at times, that I do "jump around" and pick tasks without going through the proper procedure. If I do too much of that, I'm not using the system to its full advantage, but I allow a little of that, and I think everyone does. When I do that, I just say "I'm not doing an Autofocus session right now, I'm just doing certain tasks."<br><br>I think that's ok, as long as I really do get through all the pages each day, with the correct procedure, as well.<br><br>So I've started putting the dates in a column on the right edge of the page. If I do a task without following the procedure, I write the date ("3/5"). If I go through the page with the quick scan and then the more thoughtful scan, processing the page in the recommended manner, then I write the date with a checkmark after it.<br><br>My goal is to have the day's date on every active page, with at least one checkmark. Then I know I am really getting through all the tasks. By the time the page is finished, I have a short column of sequential dates, with checkmarks, if I do it right. It helps motivate me, to have this goal.<br><br>When I get through all the pages every day in that manner, I don't have the feeling that anything will fall through the cracks. Everything on the list will come up for consideration every day until it is done or dismissed, and I am not likely to miss a deadline.<br><br>So far, this is working very well. Thanks, Mark, for this simple yet elegant system!</div>

<div class="content">I should clarify ~ I don't put the date next to the task, as I've read some people do. I just put it once on the page, in a column at the top right, whether I do one task on that page or a dozen.</div>
