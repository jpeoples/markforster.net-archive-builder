<div class="content">Let me make this clear.<br>First everybody knows I'm not a list person but to be able to coach people better to what they are attuned to, I'm trying SFv3 which is awesome by the way.<br><br>Maybe it's because I do it in tandem with my Kanban system but I have very few things in column 2 and already a couple pages where column 1 is all finished (all items have been stricken through). What do I do with these pages? If I leave them open to putting items in column 2, I have 2 consecutive pages that act as a buffer where nothing from column 1 is worked on for a while... Should I cross them off in the corner?</div>

<div class="content">Yes. If you look at Mark Forster's picture of his notebook, you'll see how he's done everything on one page and so it has an X in a corner. That page is done. He also put a squiggle mark in the space at the bottom of column 2, probably so he doesn't accidentally use it.</div>
