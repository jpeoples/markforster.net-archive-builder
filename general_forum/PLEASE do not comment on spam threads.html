<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">PLEASE do not put comments on spam threads for the following reasons:<br><br>1) It encourages the spammers to spam again if they see they are getting a reaction.<br><br>2) If I'm not here to remove them, commenting on them won't get them removed any quicker.<br><br>3) Commenting on them brings them back to the top of the pile instead of letting them sink into well-deserved obscurity.<br><br>4) When I do delete the thread it is possible that your comment will be treated as spam and you may be liable to find yourself blocked in the future as a spammer.</div>

<div class="content">The same applies to spam comments within non-spam threads. If you think someone is a spammer please do not reply to them or comment on what they have posted.</div>

<div class="content">MP:<br><br>I'd say it depends. ;-)<br><br>On the one hand there is a difference between a truly useful link and, say, posting a link to your own blog you filled with some badly written articles earlier the same day.<br><br>Then there is also the question of behavior. If you make a thread about something you created or found, and ask for feedback or discuss it there, that's probably okay. It's not okay to post the link in every discussion whether it's on-topic or not.<br><br>PS: Please tell me you are not the same person as VP as CC. ^_^</div>

<div class="content">Please note too that there is no point in commenting to draw my attention to the fact that the site is being spammed. If I am here I will remove spam anyway. If I'm not here I won't see your comment.</div>
