<div class="content">I've been working, with pretty good success, with AF for a couple of weeks now, and I just had a thought which will I think, be useful to me; maybe others will find it helpful as well.<br><br>One really nice feature of GTD is the notion of "context", which allows the grouping of things like shopping lists, errands, agnedas with specific people, "someday"'s and "maybe"'s< etc. Someone pointed out on the forums someplace that it wasn't too useful to put your shopping list into AF as it occurred to you, since you'd have a hard time finding the items. Instead, the items should be kept on a separate shopping list, and an entry "Do the marketing" should be entered into your AF list.<br><br>It occurs to me that, in this instance, "marketing" is just the context for the shopping list, and this idea could be extended in a couple of directions.<br><br>Suppose that, in addition to the AF notebook, one maintains a series of (say) 3x5 card--convenient if you're using a Moleskine size notebook--of "contexts", like "shopping", "errands", "Agenda: Joe", "Someday/Maybe", etc...? In a Moleskine, cards can be kept in the back pocket, alternatively, they could be used as a bookmark--presumably one won't have an enormous stack of these.<br><br>I feel like something along these lines would shore up a weakness in AF which the idea of "contexts" in GTD helps to address--I make a note to put something in the mail for a friend (which I can only do if I go to the post office); I might also need something at the hardware store (which is near the post office). In GTD, I'd put these all in the context of "Errands", so in the case I'd have a card with "Shopping" on one side and "Errands" on the other stuch in my notebook...<br><br>Thoughts?</div>

<div class="content">I do the same thing, pretty much, but use a page in the back of my AF notebook.  I mark the page with a sticky, used as a tab.</div>

<div class="content">Yeah, but be careful.  Don't have too many contexts or you'll spend your time managing lists rather than doing things.  For me, personally, Errands & Tickler & a very few Agenda things are all I pull out of the list.  I don't find it useful to have a Calls context as I can call anywhere and when it gets down to that level I find it to be time wasting to consult various lists.</div>

<div class="content">What Mike said. Too many context cards seems to defeat the object of a truly simple time management system.<br><br>I have one index card entitled 'Errands', and one index card entitled 'To Buy'. I write everything into the AF notebook first though, in order to have one place where everything in my head is collected. <br><br>I have separate AF notebooks for work and for personal items, and I carry the personal one around with me in my handbag wherever I go, but the work AF book is left at work, in order to preserve sanity outside the office.</div>

<div class="content">Encouraged by this, I now have 5 x 3 cards in the back folder of my Moleskine (127mm x 210mm, brown paper cover, ruled).  There is one for ERRANDS, but I've also added three cards for routine stuff: Daily, Weekly, Monthly.<br><br>As these are scheduled (unless overtaken bu emergency or other context), I don't have to scan my AF lists (Work and Personal, one book), Outlook will remind me to look at the cards,  When not working abroad, I work in a home office, so I have forced myself to show separate routine tasks for Work and Personal, but on the same card.<br><br>Example,: on the AF Weekly Routine Card, I have Filing and Clean Desk/Equipment under Work, but under Personal I also have Filing (often do the two together anyway!) along with Check Medication Stock (don't want to run out abroad).<br><br>Works for me.</div>
