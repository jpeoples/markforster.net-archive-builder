<div class="content">On a previous thread Seraphim and I aired the issue of short views of time. This is of course closely related to no-list methods or the 5T method.<br><br>1. Procrastination can be related to an imagined future step, but when attention is instead placed on the first step then resistance can be reduced. hence "I'll just get the folder out"<br><br>2. On the future step the actions that then make sense can be very different from how we'd imagine they would be. Situations evolve, as do our responses to what we want to do. A future stp is really a new starting point. It is fresh, with different potentials. New thoughts and insights can be available.<br><br>3. In a crisis "how things should be" often has to be abandoned. Instead, evaluation has to be related to NEW NOW, not "what should have happened". Expectations and preconceptions have to be dropped.<br><br>Eckhart Tolle adds a spiritual aspect: "“Always say “yes” to the present moment. What could be more futile, more insane, than to create inner resistance to what already is?"</div>

<div class="content">Another factor in short views of time is what I was saying in a recent blog post about selecting the next task from a long list. Selecting one task means rejecting other tasks. The more you reject a task the more resistance will build up against it.</div>
