<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">I thought it might be usefull to describe how I feel meetings can be integrated in the system. I do it via a sequence of actions.<br><br>First, I enter "Prepare meeting about xxx". Once I've finished my preparation (potentially through several rewritings of the preparation action), I enter an action "Process meeting notes".<br><br>After the meeting has taken place, I'll come across this entry, take out my notes and start going through them, creating an additional entry for each action point decided during the meeting. If I have to create the minutes, either I've done this at the same time, or else I write an additional action for it. So now I can file my notes, confident that everything that was decided during the meeting will actually get done.<br><br>What do others think? How do you use the system for meetings?</div>

<div class="content">Marc:<br><br>I use a very similar system, but I hadn't thought of putting "Process Meeting Notes" on the list *before* the meeting had taken place. So thanks for that - it's a very good idea.</div>
