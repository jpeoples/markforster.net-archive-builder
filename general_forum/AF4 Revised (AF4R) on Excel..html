<div class="content">There is a way to adapt AF4R digitaly and it seems be working quiet well event if I still prefer paper. <br><br>1. Take an excel sheet<br>2. Name the colums <br>- Project > Here goes your project's name<br>- Category > Dissmiss, New, old, Recurring, Tickler, Unfinished, <br>- Description  > Here describes the task<br>- When > I put the month here or W49 (week number 49)<br>- Day > Monday, tuesday and so on<br>- Duration <br><br>3 during the day sort your colums by day, projects , categories, duration<br><br>4. If something is dissmiss you can color it in yellow<br><br>5. If something is unfinished if you need the answer today color it it green<br><br>6. If something is finished don't care about the past - erase it ! But if you need an historical report it on your project. <br><br><br>It's quiet fast and easy to use.</div>

<div class="content">By project I take you to mean what we usually call a task. <br>I think this is a good idea though you added lots to the basic method. <br><br>At base you need just Task and Type columns and time updated, and (good idea) sort by Type and Date regularly.  I bet dwm.xls could easily be adapted to do this automatically. <br><br>The other manual way to do this is the 3 columns: oldnew, recurring, active, and normal use.</div>
