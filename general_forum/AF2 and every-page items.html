<div class="content">Question for Mark and others: <br><br>Like others, I think, I've had a number of items appearing on every page (most obviously "process email"), which in a way circumvents the closed-list aspect of AF for those tasks that I want to do more frequently than would occur if <br><br>Does the abandonment of the closed-list aspect in AF2 negate the need for these, do you suppose?</div>

<div class="content">Ludlow:<br><br>I can't see any reason why it would be necessary to enter them more than once in AF2. If you're processing email several times a day it will always be near the end of your list and therefore accessible very quickly.</div>
