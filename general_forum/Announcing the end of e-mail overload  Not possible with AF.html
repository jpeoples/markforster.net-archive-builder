<div class="content">I see exactly one point of conflict: Don't prioritize your tasks.  After that, everything Hurst suggests can be done while following an AF4 system.<br><br>Mark Hurst suggests moving actionable emails to a TODO list.  Let AF4 be that list.  To make the most of Hurst's ideas your TODO system should allow you to embed emails, and also use future dates as a tickler system.  AF4 operates on the TODAY page only, and date all tasks for when you can start working on them (which is usually TODAY), not when they are due.<br><br>In my case, I'm using OneNote for my AF4 and it's easy to push Outlook emails directly into my AF4 list.  <br><br>Hurst's TODO list suggestions (My responses):<br>1. Summary and detail view (Good idea.)<br>2. Priority within a day (Completely opposite AF4)<br>3. View of today's todos only, and the ability to send todos to the future, and automatic roll-over, at midnight, of any undone todos to tomorrow.  (This is beyond AF4 but if followed as above, it doesn't contradict.)<br>4. One single list of todos - not several lists (AF4!)<br>5. E-mail tie-in, allowing users to forward e-mails to future days on the todo list - or BCC themselves to create a check-in reminder in the future.  (If you can embed email into your TODO list, you have this.)</div>
