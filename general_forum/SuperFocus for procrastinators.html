<div class="content">I use SuperFocus at work, and it works great. But I'm struggling a bit to get started with some tasks. I use an antiprocrastination trick to get started on tasks. <br><br>I set aside only 5 minutes on all tasks I start on. This is sometimes a bit inefficient, but the point is to get started. As long as I know I only work five minutes with a task, I will fool myself to do some work on that task. As long as I'm saying to myself that I will only work 5 minutes with this task, it does not matter if it's boring or difficult.<br><br>When I feel I have made ​​good progress with a number of tasks, and I'm in a flow, I work a little longer with them, maybe 10 minutes or half an hour.<br><br>For me, this method resulted in that I have carried out much more in a day than I normally would.<br><br>Thought I would share my experience with others on this forum. It has made my work day more efficient and fun.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>On the US amazon.com site, your book is listed as "Get Everything Done (Help Yourself) [Paperback]" and is available for $16.50, but not available yet for Kindle.  I've clicked the "Tell the Publisher! I'd like to read this book on Kindle" link <br><br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/digital/fiona/detail/request-kindle-edition/ref=dtp_dp_su_0340746203?ie=UTF8&a=0340746203" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/digital/fiona/detail/request-kindle-edition/ref=dtp_dp_su_0340746203?ie=UTF8&a=0340746203</a><br><br>because I read just about all my books now on my iPhone, using the Amazon Kindle or B&N Nook or Google Books or Stanza or Apple iBooks app.  DIT was one of the last paperback books I purchased.  Hope your new book will be available in one of these digital formats.</div>

<div class="content">ubi:<br><br>I hope so too. But unfortunately I have no control over what the publisher does, and they are only likely to produce a Kindle version if there are enough requests for it.</div>
