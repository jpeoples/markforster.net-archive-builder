<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">Today I've decided to keep a timelog of how I spend my time.  I've started a new list just for what I want to work on today and I will process it using Standing-Out.   Unlike some other attempts at time-logging, I'm going to account for every minute rather than rounding it up or down to 5-minute slots.  I know this will add some overhead but I think it's worth it if it makes me focus carefully on what I'm doing.<br><br>Sometimes I spend a long time paralysed by the choice of possible processing methods I could use, so I'm just going to let my subconscious get on with it. It's just occurred to me that I've never given Standing-Out a sustained trial, although I believe I understand the concept behind it.  I'm hoping that the fact that I've posted this thread will be sufficient motivation to just work my way through today's tasks without procrastination.<br><br>On the subject of Standing-Out, I've come across a rather mundane example that I think describes the process.  When I go into my e-mail home page, I have to log in with my e-mail address.  The PC takes a few seconds to display the log-in box, and in those few seconds I use the mouse to position the cursor where I think the log-in box will appear.  I don't say to myself "well I know it's on the right-hand side of the screen, and I I know it's somewhere further down than the middle, and I know how high the box is, I wonder if it's about here, or maybe up a bit?" - I don't go through any of that rigmarole, I just let my hand move to where it wants, without any conscious calculation.  And nine times out of ten, it's within the box, or just a few millimetres out.  I think that's a metaphor for the standing-out process - don't get in your own way, just let your subconscious demonstrate its capability.</div>
