<div class="content">ElsewhereI have mentioned my growing satisfaction and declining fear/overload with DWM and its zoom forward property.  My current incarnation is ListPro electronic (no iPhone for me, I use Windows Mobile for now) with paper updating/monitoring during the day.<br><br>Before I get too carried away, I want to audit my approach with the basic rules of DWM.<br><br>Can someone please point me to the link or posting which sets out Mark's initiial rules for DWM, I can't find it easily.<br><br>That DWM flow diagram one savvy member produced is great, however I'd like to suggest a small modification.<br><br>I like the current flow more or less from left to right, myabe the diagram could be shifted to the right, then add a dotted line to the left which shows that Expired Tasks are reviewed (whenever, I'm trying weekly for now) in case some can come back when one has the time available to look at doing them.  I don't HAVE to revive them after a week, just have them there in case I do feel like having another go some time.<br><br>In my daily ListPro routine, I "cut" expired and done tasks from DWM ACTIVE and paste them into an identical formatted DWM Review file.  I then delete all the done tasks which I will never have to consider again, for whatever reason, and retain a minority along with the expired ones which I feel like reviewing later.<br><br>I'm thinking of using the DWM Review as a Grass Catcher/LTBW (Let The Bastard Wait) facility.</div>
