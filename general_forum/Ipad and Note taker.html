<div class="content">I love my paper note book but it's quiet big (A4) heavy and lined<br><br>A you know it follows me everywhere. <br><br>When I bought my ipad I had the secret wish I could replace my paper note book. I may have. <br><br>I discovered a new software NOTE TAKER HD <br><br>have a look at it here <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRUy0fg6yj8" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRUy0fg6yj8</a><br>it's in English so it will be easy (for you) LOL. <br><br>It's seems perfect for superfocus. <br>I just bought it today and have a try. <br>It has just the rigorism which is necessary, not much.<br><br>There is also UPAD  more simple but quiet nice too.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Jupiter, that video was interesting.  That guy has a way about him that holds your interest.  Besides illustrating the points and potential of his Note Taker HD app, it is probably a better video than any expensive video that Apple has come up with demonstrating the capabilities of iPad.<br><br>I think apps like Note Pad and Upad take time to get used to.  The first reactions may not be so intriguing.</div>

<div class="content">Ahh ... Note Taker HD is iPad only <a href="http://www.notetakerhd.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.notetakerhd.com/</a> .<br>Anyway, for now I'll satisfy myself with the basic Android Note Pad application and the SWYPE keyboard for quick input. I'm on the lookout for a nice outlining Android app though. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Jupiter- any update after you have had time to use Note Taker HD for awhile now?  Still like it?</div>

<div class="content">Hello sorry for the delay.<br><br>I tried Note taker for taking notes like on a paper notebook. But the result was bad. So I decided to put everything on Omnifocus, added new contexts, and created a context autofocus. For the urgent and un finished tasks I use start date, ends dates, and flags. <br>I also took a paper note book and reported the most important tasks to do for the day but i use it as a checklist inbox and act system for the task i really need to do today.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Jupiter.  It looks like we kind of went through the same thing.  Only since I already have Omni (and because it syncs so well with the iPad and iPhone) do I use it as a place to enter project actions for SF.  I want to keep it simple.  It could be anything really to catch and retrieve next actions (like Things or Toodledo or a project notebook).  It's when I start getting fancy with it that it turns into a problem.  It gets too big, and too outdated, too quickly.  The contexts thing is also tempting because those tasks sync automatically with iCal, etc., etc., etc.<br>I find that SF is a luxury that works when I am not out of control.  When out of control, anything will suffice - I could write 3 of the top 18 fires to put out on my forehead (or on a sticky note) in the morning.  Of course, everything else that is needed to move forward goes to hell.  <br>I also use a daily notebook like you.  I call it my Pomodoro notebook because the Pomodoro technique requires me to think about what I am going to do for the next 25 minutes, and if it is a silly thing, I am more apt to recognise it.<br>But again, the daily notebook turns into an old-style to-do list, and you find yourself dealing with the A, B, C priorities and making only partial headway down the list each day- and missing all the benefits and balance of SF.<br>But I appreciate all your comments, and thanks for getting me to take a look at Note Taker HD.  The developer really has ambition and has done a lot of work to satisfy user requests with so many neat features.  (It doesn't surprise me that he is the inventor of the spreadsheet.)  But for now, I just use it like the Chronicle app because it is so easy to add an image and make comments by hand or by typing - but more like a past-time (journal) instead of a tool.</div>
