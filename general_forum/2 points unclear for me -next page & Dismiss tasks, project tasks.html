<div class="content">Hello Sorry about those stupid question but 3 things are not very clear in my head. <br><br>1) Next page. My notebook is numbered 1 to 6 by page. My last item are on page 6. <br>Ok i work on page 6 and after reading nothing stand at me. So do i have to do my page 5,then, then 3, then 2, then 1 OR do i go on page one, then 2, 3,4 and at last 5, then again 6.<br><br>2) Mark said if nothing stand at you on a page then all items are dismissed OK i highline all of them exept the page 6 (last page) right ? then does dismissed items includes future task (that i can't do for the moment) ? <br><br>3) Lot of items are coming from projects. if you work on a project it is sometime easier to do all about the projects and avance in your work. Then if you do it, do you read all your pages to find items concerning this project or do you do only the action about it and do something else even if it doesnt belong to the project. Then you will have to come back to your next project task later....<br><br>Thanks for the answers. I red the post but didnt find or understand a precise answers to theses questions.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jupiter<br><br>Dismissing Tasks:- <br>Page 6 is your last page - the page you are entering tasks on, so is not a full page.  If nothing stands out you go back to page 1 - you do not dismiss items on the last page. You do one or more tasks on page one until no more tasks stand out.  You then move on to page two.  You only dismiss tasks on a page if no items stand out ON THE FIRST PASS - if you do at least one item on that visit to the page then you just move on to the next page.  You only dismiss items on that page - NOT on all pages. <br><br>Future Date:-<br>If a task can only be done at a future date, you can action it by adding it to your schedule - either on the date it must be done, or as a reminder to add it to your list at the appropriate time.<br><br>Project Tasks:-<br>If your method of project working requires several actions to be worked on, you may find it easier to list those actions within your project management system and just write "project x" as the task in AF.  If you only occasionally do items out of sequence that will not be a major problem - just cross them off when you reach the relevant page, but I would caution against "item hunting" as a regular practice.  I find it helpful to be able to extract lists of project tasks for reference and very occasional "block action" but would not recommend this as a consistent method of working as it detracts from the page by page "closed list" approach.<br><br>Hope that helps a little?</div>

<div class="content">Thankd indeed Christine then it's clear for me. <br><br>Just wonder for future date you said :<br>"If a task can only be done at a future date, you can action it by adding it to your schedule - either on the date it must be done, or as a reminder to add it to your list at the appropriate time". Ok that's what what i do with ical and it works well. <br><br>But when you extract an item from AF to put it on your schedule, do you cross it in AF ?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jupiter<br><br>As AF works with discretionery time you need a schedule as well.  If I have a timed item I add it to miy list as "add xyz appointment to schedule" and yes, cross it off in AF as actioned.  Similarly if an item can "only" be actioned in the future then it does not belong on the list.  If it "can" be done before that time then it is not a future item and should be actioned or dismissed according to the rules.</div>

<div class="content">Now it's clear in my mind . Thanks again to you Christine :)). <br>Do you have a web site about things you do or like ? If yes sure others (& I) would like to read you acording to your explanation always interesting. <br>Best regards.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jupiter<br><br>I'm actually in the process of getting a website set up - one of the things AF has prompted me to do :-)  and something I have procrastinated on for too long!!!  I am hoping to have it set up within the next couple of weeks ..........</div>
