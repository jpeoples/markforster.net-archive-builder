<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">I spent the first couple of days starting to write down some tasks.  But I didn't have time to write down some key work and personal tasks, so I didn't actually get started till today.<br><br>I started the day with 6 pages and 138 tasks.  By end of day, I had added 5 more pages and 105 new tasks, and had completed 59 tasks.<br><br>Overall it felt very natural, very fast, very productive.  I felt like I am never going to just "forget" to do something -- I very quickly came to feel that I could trust the system, and started throwing everything I could think of into it.  I even decided to take on some extra creative tasks that I normally would decline.<br><br>I work from home most of the time, and can usually alternate short personal tasks with longer  bursts of work activity.  So, it makes sense for me to have a single, combined list.  Today, I felt that AF gave me a very good intuitive feel if I was spending too much time on a personal task, and needed to "get back to work", but also prompted me to deal with a pressing personal matter.  If I had kept two separate lists, I think I would be in a constant state of anxiety that there's something "on the other list" that needs to get done.<br><br>However, there are some days when I am at the office, and can't do the personal tasks.  I'm not quite sure how to deal with that.  I suppose if I get to a page that has only personal items remaining, I'll just skip that page, till I am in a context where I can act on those items.  But there are some prpblems with this approach.  <br><br>For example, what if I have three personal items and one work item left on a page, and I am at the office / can't do the personal items since I'm not working from home?   If I just pretend the personal items aren't on the list, then that leaves me with just the single work item.  OK, let's say I decide to "dismiss" that work item.  OK, now that item is highlighted, but I didn't actually close the whole page, since I have three active personal items there.<br><br>Normally, when working from home, I wouldn't be forced to dismiss that item -- I could choose to do a tiny amount of work on one of the personal items.  <br><br>This problem can occur whenever you have multiple contexts, and when you have tasks that can be done in many contexts, but not all.  If you really make a list for all your different contexts, then you have the old nasty GTD problem -- how do I know when to switch contexts?   How do I know to switch from @work to @personal, if each has its own separate list, but realistically when working from home, I could choose to do tasks from either list?   The GTD way to resolve this is with a regular review, to keep you in tune with everything -- but I just have so much going on all the time, I could never block out the time for a regular review.  It was just too much overhead.  I'd rather be getting things done!<br><br>With AF, I found that using a combined lists allowed *AF itself* to help me decide when to do a personal task, and when to do a work task.  If I kept separate lists, I'd have to use "brute force" to make that decision, or "self-control" as some have put it, or just use my calendar to tell me when it's OK to switch contexts.  But AF is so much better at cluing you in on when it's the best time to do what.<br><br>So, I think I'll stick with a combined list.  But this means I need to deal with that problem of what to do when the items on a page CAN'T be done right now, because the context is wrong.  Dismissing them doesn't make sense.   Maybe just ignoring them is best -- just use common sense.  I don't want to add complex elements like a context tag at the top of each page, and different colored highlights for different contexts; etc.  If I really get precise about it, I probably have 10+ active, real contexts that I could use to contextualize my tasks (@computer, @desk, @upstairs-with-kids, @upstairs-alone, @outside, @office, @errands, @dr-office, @garden, @goats, @church, @other-church, @community-meeting, etc etc etc).  I want to use AF to balance between them all, guide me through it -- it just did such a great job doing exactly that, today.  Even though it was my first day, it feels so natural and so easy and so productive, I just can't wait to keep going with it.<br><br>Any other thoughts for dealing with multiple contexts?</div>

<div class="content">Actually I'm doing the same. I don't like the idea of having separate list, I have quite a number of tasks I can do at home and at the office. <br>I'm close to the situation that a page contains only items that can be done exclusively at home (one office item left) and I think with the next scan (I'm currently at work) I will simply ignore those home tasks, since it's not psychological resistance stopping me from tackling these items. <br>Mark (Forster), how do you think about this solution?</div>

<div class="content">I am thinking along the same lines.<br><br>I have been using an A4 journal which in which I have subdivided the pages thus:<br><br>- About 20 lines down I put a horizontal line across each page of my journal<br><br>- Above the horizontal line I put a vertical line which splits the area in the ratio one third / two thirds<br><br>- I now have 3 areas on each page. <br><br>The top left area I use for my work tasks, it is wide enough for me to add sufficient detail<br><br>The top area on the right I use to put personal tasks, the column is quite narrow but allows me to throw at it tasks - 'cheque in bank', 'visit boots', etc. These I do normally at lunch time.<br><br>Below the line I use the rectangular space to capture notes, phone messages, etc. That way I am not flipping in my journal and I have my work and personal tasks as well as notes all to hand.<br><br>On days when I am not working I reverse the priority, the wider column is allocated to personal task, but the narrow 'work' column is still there in case I think of something while I am away from the job.<br><br>Seems to be working well for me.<br><br>Mark Crossfield</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br>I don't have this problem myself as I only have one location, but I can appreciate it is a difficulty for some people.<br><br>My preferred solution is to divide the page into two (or more) segments, approximately in the proportion of the number of tasks falling into each area. For example if you usually get twice as many work tasks as home tasks, then divide the page 2/3 work and 1/3 home.<br><br> You use the whole page when scanning for the next item to action, which means you can do work tasks at home and home tasks at work if you wish. But you treat each segment as a separate page for the purpose of closing pages and dismissing items. So you would only dismiss work items when you are at work, and home items when you are at home.<br><br>That solution seems to me to get the best of both worlds.</div>

<div class="content">Having struggled with the same problem, I have simply introduced two further highlighters in different colours on top of the one used for rejected items. <br><br>So, what I do is: everything goes into the same A4 notebook. As there are inevitable variations in the amount of work/personal tasks I am not keen on dividing the page into fixed section as this would disturb the smooth and even filling up of the last pages (i.e. I might have to go to  the next page when the work section is full while there is still space in the personal section etc). After listing, anything that is personal gets a yellow dot in the margin next to it; anything that is work gets a red one. The procedure is then the same as the one Mark outlines above: I can skim the whole page but the two colours get treated differently for closing. <br></div>

<div class="content">Here I think electronic solutions may be favourable over paper systems.  MyLifeOrganized (MLO) which I have just posted about, can easily be setup for multiple environments - within the same file. You could either have different Outline sections for home/work or utilise the same and implement a context.  <br><br>Rapid Task Entry with MLO allows for parsing - which means a task could be added quickly and be context specific on entry 'Reply to MF Posts re short lists @Home'.   Customised views means the lists could be viewed based on a number of aspects - context being one.<br><br>So in this way you have multiple options but with all the data being located in the same file. You could choose to view all home items, all work items, or all items. In other words you can have as much or as little separation as you require. <br> <br>All the best<br> <br>Steve<br></div>

<div class="content">Thanks for pointing out a solution to this issue -- namely, dividing the page horizontally and using the upper part for work tasks and the lower for personal.<br><br>I'd just bought my day-planner diary for the year (one day to a page) for DIT use. It's the same diary I've used for 3 years, and adapted beautifully to DIT, though i also had the problems of where to put new items, will-do, not finishing everything and declaring a backlog, etc. The diary also has a generous section of lined pages for to-dos.<br><br>I use this diary for work and home/school/personal, so I liked having everything in one place.<br><br>With AF, I repurposed a partially used notebook to track my work tasks, and used my diary's lined pages for personal tasks. But this week, I've found myself with two books open on my office desk and stopping to think about which book a task should go on. And then marking my start/stop project times in the diary. And then blending personal stuff into my work tasks book because I could use interstices of time to send emails related to school, home, etc. And then finding I'd double-entered personal tasks into my diary's lined pages. So the transition between the two books wasn't smooth.<br><br>This discussion has encouraged me to instead use my work tasks book for both work and personal stuff, and then I'll just carry it around for a few days to see how I adapt to it. I do often like to knock off quickie personal emails during breaks in the work day (however, I hardly ever take work home with me, so at night and on weekends, more personal tasks will go on the list).<br><br>I'll still leave my diary open to today's page, so I can record timings, phone calls, meetings, etc. I don't want to overload the AF book by having it track the minutia of my day.<br></div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the many good suggestions.  I think I'll try a variation of Mark Forster's suggestion of using a horizontal line, and will report back on how it goes.<br><br>Thanks again!</div>
