<div class="content">... I do one of the tasks (to be dismissed), on the spot, out of guilt and/or fear?<br><br>This AM, I was implementing the following:<br>"....all items before the line which have not been actioned are dismissed"<br>when I stumbled across a task I needed to do. So I did it. Fine, right? But if I keep doing this, my fear is that the power of dismissal will be lost. <br><br>Comments/suggestions?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Avrum,<br><br>I'm not sure I see the problem.  The point of dismissal is to get you to do the tasks about to be dismissed, no?  So who cares what the motive is so long as they get done?  The dismissal threat is working.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Avrum<br><br>I've been allowing myself to action the "on notice" tasks at any point during the day and not finding it has created any negative effect.  What I am finding with AF2 is that my pattern of thinking has somehow changed - I find myself really enjoying the patterns that are emerging from my statistics and am a lot more aware of items in my list and making much much quicker progress.  Without the need to do at least one item on a page I can move through the list quickly and something will always stand out.  Consequently I am keeping up with all my current stuff with minimal effort and still clearing the backlog items.  When I started AF2 on 1 July I had 362 open tasks - as of yesterday I had 220.<br><br>Actually I am finding that I am not too concerned with the very early items; the majority are things that I want to or need to do but that are non-urgent and I am happy to leave them until the "line of doom" creeps close.  Most of my time is spent at the end and the middle of the list.  The trouble is that the middle is shrinking to an extent that that line will soon start to speed up ...........</div>
