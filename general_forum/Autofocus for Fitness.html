<div class="content">I set up a separate autofocus list called "fitness" last week and it's working quite well.  I don't have a set routine for fitness, but I have specific goals I am trying to reach, so I started by listing the goals like "Do 100 pushups" and "Run 5k".  Each time I do something towards that goal, I mark it down with the date and note the progress like this: "Push-ups: 37/100"  The next time I am in the mood to work out, I check the list and try to at least equal or improve my current level.  I then note the date and write down the new level at the end of the list.<br><br>I like this more than any other way of tracking my fitness because I can see when I added the item and how long it's been since I did it.   Very motivating.</div>

<div class="content">Gretchen,<br><br>Interesting post, see <a href="http://hundredpushups.com" rel="nofollow">http://hundredpushups.com</a> for advice.  I had got to 60 when an old injury re-appeared, not due to the push-ups!  I must start again, I need to get my 61 year-old back and shoulders in condition for dragging my luggage around airports on assignments.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks.  I'm finding that it works for me mainly because I work from home and I'm not on a strict schedule.  I also have a back injury (shattered L4) so I can work out when I feel like it and still track my progress even if I can't do all exercises every day.  I also like having options to choose from.  If I don't feel like doing pushups today, I might go for a run instead so I can mark that off my list.  I still did something and moved closer to my goal.</div>
