<div class="content">Since I no longer use GTD, and find Zen Habits a tad irritating, I'm on the lookout for new/fresh blogs that compliment Autofocus. Barring that... what blogs do you find helpful vis-a-vis inspiration, productivity, entrepreneurship, etc?</div>

<div class="content">A very non-GTD-ish, and funny, productivity blog is Nick Cernis's Put Things Off (<a href="http://putthingsoff.com/)." rel="nofollow">http://putthingsoff.com/).</a> You might enjoy it and pick up some useful advice. (Then again, you might find it utterly silly and useless I guess.)</div>

I am trying to put up at least one new article a week.<br><br><a href="http://simpletimemanagement.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://simpletimemanagement.blogspot.com/</a><br><br>Steve Pavalina has some good stuff, although I am not a huge fan of the law of attraction genre, there is some good stuff there, Mark has a link as well as whakate.com.<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">Heh, yeah I guess Nick's stuff is kinda cute. What about Stepcase Lifehack ( <a href="http://www.lifehack.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.lifehack.org/</a> )? Might still not quite be the spanking you're after, but I've found a couple of articles I enjoyed there. ;)</div>

<div class="content">BTW: What do people here think of the Whakate site (link on the left on these pages)?<br><br>And maybe their Best of Web 2008 ( <a href="http://www.whakate.com/emonitor/best-of-personal-development-and-productivity-2008/" rel="nofollow">http://www.whakate.com/emonitor/best-of-personal-development-and-productivity-2008/</a> ) might have some more tips for you, avrum.</div>

<div class="content">Gerry - hope I don't come off sounding like an ass, but I like to know about the background of TM/productivity authors.</div>

<div class="content">Lifehack is too close to zen habits. When they started taking on more serious mental health issues, I walked away.</div>

<div class="content">Avrum,<br><br>No worries.  I am not a published author like Mark or David Allen.  I am in the investment management business and have over the years read, tried and used pretty much all of the systems out there.  My system is developed based upon what I think works and provides the most return on your investment, which is in my opinion a simple, portable,  paper based system.  It was written on a variety of plane rides over the last year or so.<br><br>Part of my thinking is that TM requires an investment of time and like any other investment it should produce a return on investment.  I don't want to bag on GTD which I used, but for me the return was negative.  In other words, more time invested than saved using it.  I also am not a fan of the idea that a TM system takes two years to master.  So, I took what worked for me and put it into two simple paper based systems, that I have used and have provided me a positive return on the time invested to set up and use them, which is like AF not a big time investment to get going.  <br><br>At this point, I give the first ebook away and sell the second for a nominal charge, it is not how I primarily make my living, but hope I am adding something to the productivity discussion.  My other pet peeve is systems that are not supported and books that are teasers to buy other products, so I try to be available to answer questions.  <br><br>But of course with Mark, you get the best of all worlds, free productivity systems from a known expert and free support via the forum.  That's a deal you can't beat.    <br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://simpletimemanagement.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://simpletimemanagement.blogspot.com/</a></div>
