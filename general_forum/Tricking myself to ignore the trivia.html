<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">On a different thread ( <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1306011#item1306173" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1306011#item1306173</a> ), Alan and Mark posted:<br><br>Alan:  I click the Read it Later button.  Later, I have a list of things to read.<br><br>Mark:  Which you never get round to reading? <br><br><br>I also use Read It Later.  But while Alan actually gets back to his Read It Later list, I found that I almost never do.   <br><br>But I found a way to take advantage of this.   <br><br>In my DWM list, I use a few Outlook categories to sort and limit the lists.  I created a couple categories, "Work Misc." and "Personal Misc.", for items that I'd like to explore, or ideas that pop into my head, or stuff that shows up in my inbox that looks like maybe I should do something with it, but it's not part of my main work.<br><br>So, I apply the category, apply the appropriate deadline (today+30), and archive it.<br><br><br>The cool thing:  I (almost) never actually check those categories to see what work I need to do there.   And I haven't noticed anything falling apart or come crashing down, and nobody ever complains that the work isn't getting done.<br><br>It's almost as good as deleting or dismissing!    But both of those actions seem so FINAL, and if later I change my mind, it's so hard to find those tasks again.   <br><br>By calling it "misc" and putting it on a separate list, it's still there if I really want it - but I never really do.    By the time I actually get around to looking at the Misc lists, most of the tasks have already "expired" (fallen off the DWM waterfall).  I configure my list so those items don't show up.   So in effect, the tasks all just get dismissed after a while and I never even notice.<br><br>This allows me to focus more on important work and required maintenance tasks.  And if I ever do want to find one of those tasks, I can usually get to them pretty quickly with a search.</div>

<div class="content">That's very close to the same as my experience. The Read Later list is just one example of many such lists I have. I don't have automated dismissal, but "out of sight out of mind" works, provided it's captured. To give these items a chance to recover I name their lists as todos, but by the time I get to a low-priority list, much stuff is moot. A high priority list though gets viewed frequently and its stuff doesn't get forgotten.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim,Alan: agree, nice reminder re the importance of capturing everything.<br><br>Sometimes I put a task in a 'Grasscatcher' list, sometimes a LTBW list ('Let The B*stard Wait') to which I will sometimes transfer Dismissed tasks.  As you mentioned, Alan, some of these low-priority tasks just wither away and get past their sell-by date without the world coming to an end.<br><br>I can pick these two lists up in a routine/maintenance task in the main SF list.</div>

<div class="content">I bought an iPad to read my scientific papers, as I was really bad at printing them and I was not keen on organizing hardcopies. My pdfs, though, are very organized.<br><br>The upside of the iPad is that I decided to use it to read everything electronic as well. No more spending an hour a day reading on the computer. I mark many things to on Read It Later and just read long articles at night on the iPad.<br><br>I usually read or delete all on the same day, so no more reading backlog. And the side-effect is that I am more prone to read long and deep things, and quickly delete some things which are just not interesting. When I read during the day on my computer screen I read the short things, even if they were not interesting, and just skipped long articles.<br><br>I bet any tablet would do it, and even your laptop brought to the living room (but with e-mail turned off :D).</div>

<div class="content">I remember some years ago someone (unfortunately I can't remember who) wrote to me to describe his time management method.<br><br>He had a tickler file numbered with the days of the month, i.e. 1-31. Each day he would put all correspondence received into the tickler file for that day. So today is the 16th, and it would go into the compartment for the 16th.<br><br>First thing each day he would take out of the tickler file for that day all the correspondence he had put in it a month previously. He invariably found that 95% of it had happened anyway, or was no longer relevant.<br><br>I'm not sure I'd recommend it, but he seemed very happy with it!</div>
