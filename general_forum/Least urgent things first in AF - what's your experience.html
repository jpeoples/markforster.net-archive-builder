<div class="content">In DIT, Mark recommends to start tasks with far away deadlines early, to avoid them becoming urgent and stressful (if I remember correctly, it's been a while since I read the book). It strikes me that AF is very well suited to this approach. You can just inject those tasks and get them rolling.<br><br>So I listed a series of actions I need to progress by a certain target date, some as far as the end of the year, in AF to see what would happen. And see, I already completed some tasks due by end of December in February. Somehow I even feel less resistance to these tasks, because the far-away deadline somehow makes them less threatening. So I'm afraid I may risk that they get done way in advance, while more urgent tasks become overdue...<br><br>Do other users of the system do the same? What's your experience?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Marc<br><br>It sounds as if AF is working well for you.  There is a tendency to think that "urgent" tasks don't get done because of panic or lack of time or that we have procrastinated on other items.  If a task does not get done "in time" it is possible that we just have too much to do, but it is also possible that there is a resistance.  It is highly unlikely that tasks will be accidentally missed in AF as there are safeguards in place.  If there is a resistance to doing the item then AF will highlight it and enable you to assess the reason.<br><br>I have virtually completed some tasks due next year but am resisting others - I have identified the reason for that resistance and am trying (not terribly happily I have to say!) to work around those reasons.  Sometimes we will find that we have to make decisions which we do not want to make ...... :-(</div>

<div class="content">Marc, won't you know before the time of the looming deadline that it's coming up?  I put everything that I know has to get done for my work in plenty of time, but I'm not putting much detail as the process is new to me.  <br><br>So I'm starting to work on budgets (due in June-July) and quarter end (due around July 15) now.  Mostly because I want to find a better way to pull everything together because that's entertaining for me.  But also because year-end is now fresh in my mind and I want to ensure I start cleaning up some problems while I still remember the issues.  <br><br></div>
