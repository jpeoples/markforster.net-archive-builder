<div class="content">Hello all<br><br>We have created a simple Autofocus application for Windows. You are welcome to visit its home page:<br><br><a href="http://www.autofocusapplication.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.autofocusapplication.com/</a><br><br>Autofocus application is basically an electronic notebook which can be used instead of the paper notebook. It's very simple to use; I believe you won't need any instructions at all. However, if anyone wish to read a short description of its features and usage, we've created a brief instruction document here:<br><br><a href="http://www.autofocusapplication.com/documentation/brief-instructions.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.autofocusapplication.com/documentation/brief-instructions.html</a><br><br>I'd love to hear your thoughts about it. We'll develop it further and support other AF systems as well, so your suggestions for improvements and new features are welcome.</div>

<div class="content">Do you have a Mac version? <br><br>Do you have a Droid version?<br><br>Do you have a way to sync desktop version with a mobile version, if you have one?<br><br>Looks like it has a lot of potential for the way I do things.<br><br>Matt</div>

<div class="content">Hi Thomas,<br><br>I've browsed your site <a href="http://www.autofocusapplication.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.autofocusapplication.com/</a>  and see that it's implementing AF1 per <a href="http://www.markforster.net/autofocus-system/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/autofocus-system/</a> . I've moved to DWM, that's not yet listed on <a href="http://www.markforster.net/autofocus-index/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/autofocus-index/</a> . There are other un-listed AF versions under testing (SAF and AF4R).<br><br>I'm downloading your 8MB AfSetup.msi that requires xMB .Net 4.0 framework. I will give further comments later. <br><br>However, the following are what would make me consider using it full time ...<br>(1) Portability, that is ability to use the application *other* than on my Windows Desktop/Notebook. Some ways to achieve that are: mobile application, mobile website, and paper pdf booklet export.<br>(2) Good import/export via CSV/XML/Text.<br>(3) Not least, implementing DWM. ;-)</div>
