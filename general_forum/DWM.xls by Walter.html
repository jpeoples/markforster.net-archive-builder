<div class="content">I just checked. I have Walter's DWM.xls v1.1.2 circa Dec 2010 that I'd slightly modified. If that's useful for you I can email or put on my website for you to download. You can get me at sabre23t at gmail.com .</div>

<div class="content">How did you get on with DWM.xls, Greenchutney?<br>Or have you moved on to AF1/SF on OneNote as a recent post seems to say?</div>

<div class="content">@sabre23t,<br><br>I decided not to use DWM.xls once I found out that OneNote has mobile version for iPhone which syncs up. I was using DWM2 with OneNote with very good success. I have always found AF1 to be an excellent system for its simplicity but a bit unstructured for me!<br><br>Now, I have been trying out Seraphim’s original Auto-DIT with a few tweaks for timed dismissal. I find Auto-DIT (plus my dismissal tweaks) as an extension of DWM with tickler and an uncommitted list (NEW or Inbox) integrated into the system. I really like it so far. I have not yet dismissed any items because of inactivity after committing to it (7-day dismissal rule). These tasks nearing the 7-day mark have always stood out for me to save them from dismissal!<br><br>The only issue I have seen so far with this system is that I need to be careful to not abuse the moving tasks (multiple times) to the FUTURE dates as there is a possibility for tasks to escape dismissal. So, I am experimenting to curb this tendency by allowing any task to move to the FUTURE list only once. Overall, the system has been working well so far. <br><br>GC</div>

<div class="content">Greenchutney, if you'll be using OneNote on an iOS device, you might want to take a look at MobileNoter. I've found that it offers a LOT more functionality than the official OneNote app. However, it's not free. There's a one-time fee for WiFi sync or a subscription fee for OTA sync.</div>
