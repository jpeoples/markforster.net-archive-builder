<div class="content">I'm setting goals for 2010 and further. I have there for example belly off goal. Under work focus area I have earn 100.000. That's two times more then I get now. Do you think goals should be real or exciting? How would you put it into your AF: 'earn 100k' or 'sign contract with XYZ company for 100K' is better?</div>

<div class="content">Personally, I don't make resolutions or set goals (well, at least not for the year). That leads to fantasizing and makes you feel good without having done anything. It also doesn't really push you, because not keeping your new year resolutions is kind of excepted.<br><br>Instead, I made a *prediction* what will happen this year. A prediction is much more rooted in my current situation (even if it may be well over the top) and I find it much easier to assess at the end of the year and much more illumination. Also I find it strangely exciting.</div>

<div class="content">I like to start with DREAMS which can be whatever you like. From them stem GOALS. Of course, not every dream qualifies to become a goal. A goal should be achievable and realistic and should have a target date. However, it is good for goals to be ambitious and challenging. I hope this helps.</div>

<div class="content">I don't know what a "belly off" goal is, but if it has to do with losing weight, I can help. It is an easy goal to achieve.<br><br>Doubling your income in a year, if you come up with a sure-fire way to pull that one offm I will give 10% of my income each year.</div>

<div class="content">Norman, if I could get 10 people to donate as you promise, that would be an easy way to double my income :-)  re goals: I'm not so great at that, but I hear Leo Babuta is.  Look up his blog, book, etc.  One of his keys is focus.  Find one goal and work on only that goal for a while.</div>
