<div class="content">I have been using the system since February.  So far I have taken a Circa notebook and divided it into 5 sections.  I work from home so I have one section for home, one section for my main website, one section for client work, one for fitness, and one for general note-taking.  The 4 AF lists work well, but sometimes I forget to check one of them and something falls through the cracks.  I am wondering if I should make one big list and just use that rather than separating them.  Anyone else work at home and using one AF list for everything?</div>

<div class="content">I think you have answered your own question... you have too many lists!<br><br>If you are working at home, you would probably be most successful with either one list for everything, or a work list and a non-work list.   But I don't work at home, so someone who does will have  a better answer.<br><br>Charles</div>

<div class="content">Gretchen:<br><br>My recommendation in the instructions is that one has one list per location, rather than one list per subject. So if you work in a different location from home, you need two lists. If you work at home, you need one list. Of course some people's circumstances are more complicated than that, but the basic principle is that you should have as few lists as possible.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the replies.  :)<br><br>I'm going to rearrange the pages in my circa so they are one main list and rewrite all of the "last pages" into one last page and go from there.  I think that will help.  I was using the separation because I wanted to focus on different areas as I worked, but the truth is I am tossing in a load of laundry during my work day or calling the plumber, etc.  I don't think it detracts from my work to squeeze in home chores here and there during my work day as I see fit, so it shouldn't be a big deal to have them on the same list.<br><br>I'll give it a shot and report back. ;)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Gretchen<br>For what it's worth, I believe that thinking styles play a large part in this.  I've ALWAYS THRIVED on categorizing my work because I'm genetically a whole systems thinker and I NEED higher levels of stimulation to feel at ease in my own skin.  Therefore, I need to see the whole picture (the reasons) and then subdivide it into goals to keep me challenged and stimulated.  Another huge factor for me is that I was rigorously trained to choose goals, strategize and schedule how I'm going to reach my goals and also plan/find time to allow life's wonderful surprises to be welcomed into the mix.  I guess I'm the hybrid result of Anglo/Celtic mindsets!  LOL!  I'm glad that I was trained how to think and do sequentially only in the manner that it serves my whole systems mind!  LOL!  I truly believe that genetics and upbringing factor into our current modes of being as well as decisions we've made along the way to discovering what we need to be and do to feel like we're living the most appropriate life for ourselves and our important others factored in.  Passions and responsibilites must be clearly known while others are gifts that enter into our lives.  Isn't it all just grand!!!!  <br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>Bottom line, I organize my life around my values, principles and passions.  Even when I'm just coasting, I'm being driven by my meta-goal...quality of life.  I firmly believe it's a combinition of my brain's genetic encoding/development, my history, my own future forcasting, and my current environment.....but bottom line, I try to live as best I can in accord with what I was made to be (my natural propensities and gifts combined).  I'm humming in my goal oriented world.  That's why my AF is restricted to timeboxing miscellaneous items that I couldn't put on a checklist , a goal plan or into a life category. ROTFL  I always used be asked something along the lines...how can you be so damned methodical and yet be so free-spirited? I never figured out which one depended on the other.  They seem to work in tandem as a sort of synergistic whole.  Which came first?  The chicken or the egg?<br>learning as I go<br></div>

<div class="content">"how can you be so damned methodical and yet be so free-spirited?"  LOL - I get asked this all the time.  People say I confuse them because I am so goal-oriented, focused and organized yet I can totally go with the flow and not get stressed when my "plans" get interrupted.</div>

<div class="content">One list. Keeping multiple lists just seems like an unnecessary complication. Keeping one list  allows me to action on item per day per page more easily. Never know which item will free up resistance for another. Sometimes doing a few dishes in the morning for some reason allows me to tackle the task I have been avoiding at work with ease.<br><br>FWIW. You might want to read through the forums on this subject. IIRC, most folks opted for one.<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Gretchen<br>Yes!  I highly suspect that I was trained to keep pace with my responsibilities and developing my talents so that I kept myself current or slightly ahead..........so that.....when life offered an unexpected yet welcomed opportunity or I got highly inspired to work on something, I could set the more mundane responsibilities aside for awhile while I flowed with the surprise event or inspiration.  I don't think our methodology would work quite as well if we had nagging doubts about our responsibilities.  When I have the chance to either jump on an opportunity or ride the crest of the wave of  creative passion flowing, I don't want the drag of worrying about the more mundane responsibilities!  LOL!  This also makes keeping cool in an emergency easier because our focus isn't being fractured by niggling doubts or nagging guilt!  LOL!<br>Thank you for this wonderful post.  It's so nice to meet another member of our flock!..... "birds of a feather...."<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Hi Norman<br>I highly respect that what you say is true for you and others who share your thinking style.  For thinkers like Gretchen and me, categorizing is how we reduce things to make them simpler for our minds to process.  Our default thinking and doing systems are structured differently from yours.  A weak example might be.....The quote...you don't need to see the top of the staircase to take the first step.....sounds logical unless you're a whole systems thinker.  I won't budge until I at least know WHY!   I firmly believe that some of this is genetic encoding!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">ps.<br><br>I am not aiming to see what will free up resistance at all.  My thinking style/goal orientation cues me to use resistance as a cue/goal to do it ASAP!  LOL!  <br>There's little or no use to argue or defend apples vs oranges.  Bottom line, we're all getting our work done in the manner that's best for us!  I found the AF list to SLOW my progress because it was too random...but, I'd certainly be a fool to believe that my response was share by everyone........only by others who share my mous operandi<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Hi Gretchen<br>I, too, chunk out most of my normal house responsibilities as background work with a "while I'm here, whiling I'm waiting for the water to boil, etc" methodology.  I use checklists for dedicated time toward the more formalized work.  I can't see myself washing down the walls a swipe at a time...but....I can see and regularly do swipe off miscellaneous hand or paw print in between scheduled cleaning timeboxes!  LOL!<br>I figure if I'm staying on top of the superficial top cleaning and keep things current,  the harder work won't get a chance to turn into either filth or chaos or mountains of laundry  Most housekeeping can be done in regular bits through out the day in a hardly noticed manner!

<div class="content">I think most of my reason for making one big list is that my "home" list wasn't getting any attention until late in the evening or weekends and then some tasks couldn't be done because certain businesses were closed.  And sometimes life was so busy (two active kids to shuttle around) that I didn't check it at all and then I'm scrambling to do simple 5-minute tasks at the last second because I never got back to looking at the list.  I'm not really referring to household cleaning tasks.  I do those when I see they are needed - I don't even write them down.  I'm talking about non-work tasks like "fill out field trip permission slip" or "return call to softball coach".  Stuff that can easily be handled in 5 minutes or less but couldn't be actioned at the time they arrived on my desk.  I figure if I'm seeing them on a master list, I can just do them and get them out of the way well before they are due.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Gretchen<br>Again, we are of like mind!  My only AF list is miscellaneous stuff that isn't habitualized or planned for.  Sometimes I'll pre-record the news or a silly 1/2 comedy show, and pause when there's a commercial break.  I'll set the timer and start slapping at my AF list.  (It's really my miscellaneous list but I now call it my AF list to feel somewhat included here.  *blush*)  Most 1/2 shows have 4 commercial breaks so that gives me a full hour to knock the list down using the show itself as the carrot to continue on!  LOL!  If something is boring to me, I have several "tools" to accomodate it.  Some things need to be done sequentially and some don't.  The boredom factor is my worst sticking point of most work.  If I can get past it, I'm home free!  LOL!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Hi learning as I go<br><br>Great posts - you and I work so differently and I so admire your "stickability", your ability to just get stuff done regardless - can you bottle it and send me some? :-) <br><br>I think what you say about learned behaviour is so true - it is personality that defines a big part of how we see and do things but a lot is also down to learned patterns, from what we have seen others do, from what we have been taught, and what we perceived to have been factors in either success or failure.<br><br>I love your comment about "discovering what we need to be and do to feel like we're living the most appropriate life for ourselves and our important others factored in."<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Gretchen<br><br>I've worked with one list from the beginning and find that works really well for me.  Most of my task actioning is at home so that works well.  I think Mark's point about location is important - separating by type or @context seems to make things more complicated.</div>

<div class="content">Some time ago someone (thank you, whoever you are) suggested adding work items from the top down and home items from the bottom up, on the same page, drawing a line where they eventually meet somewhere in the middle of the page. I find that this is working brilliantly for me. It is one list, but I can see what is where contextually. The home list climbs higher up the page on non-work days, and the work list grows lower down on work days. Perhaps it should be called the stalagmite and stalactite method!<br>Anyway, as I said, it works for me and might be helpful for those of you who need to differentiate within AF somehow.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine<br>Ditto, right back at you!  I, too, greatly enjoy reading your posts!  Although we have different methodologies in how we organize and approach our work, I quite enjoy  watching your intelligence and personality weaving throughout each of your posts!

I almost choked when my eyes came upon the word "just"!  ROTFL!  If the work is boring or I'm determined to push myself through a muddling high or mind-numbing pain or a horrific case of donkey mind, "just" is NOT the appropriate word to describe how I get things done.  It's more like an "F Troop" brigade storming the Indians!  We might win the skirmish, but not without a few arrows landing in our own arses!

<div class="content">Learning:  "mous operandi"  ROTFLMAO ;-)  With four cats around here that makes so much more sense as written!  ;-)<br><br>Gretchen:  One list makes the most sense to me, but as with you and "learning", I need to have my work organized to help me see how things relate to each other.  But not in every case.  So what I did was compromise.  I have "sub lists" or "secondary lists" for SOME things ... those which need organizing.  Sometimes I'll create those "lists" with a highlighter applied to the main list so that it is a kind of "virtual" sub list.  Some of my VERY FEW sub lists are:<br><br>- Things to talk with my wife about<br>- Things I need to do with one of my computers to keep Windows at bay ;-)<br>- My tickler items are always separate so I can see the gotchas quickly<br>- My reading list organized a third level by area of interest<br>- Shopping lists (including things to order from Amazon and such)<br><br>Finally, I will occasionally create an "ad hoc list".  I have one to manage tasks for an upcomng visit ... I've got to get the house more organized by next week!  I will have an ad hoc list for my vacation in June.  I don't argue with Mark on this kind of thing ... I really COULD just put them on the main AF list and they would not be overlooked ... my mind simply does not work that way however.  I've tried and I just can't sleep at night if I don't organize things.  I agree with "learning" ... it is no doubt genetic ;-)<br><br>EVEN SO ... I have all of my lists in the same book as my main AF list.  That in itself provides a measure of sanity in that I don't have to ride heard on multiple books!!!!  You can do this easily with your Circa system, I'm sure.  I'd love to have a system like that, but the other part of my genetic makeup won't let me spend that kind of money when my pocket spiral book costs only $4.00 for 10!  LOL ;-)<br></div>

<div class="content">Just an update.  I tried the one big list for the last month.  Not working so well.  I'm going back to my multiple lists.  My work style is to start my mornings on my web site (list #1), my afternoons on client work (list #2) and my evenings/weekends on lists #3 and #4.  <br><br>I know the recommendation is one list for each "location" but even though I work and live in the same location, mentally I switch gears so separate lists make more sense.  <br><br>I think what I need to do is remove deadline driven tasks from my AF lists and put them on my calendar so they are taken care of on time regardless of which "location" they fall under.  <br><br>The main reason for the switch back to multiple lists is that I miss being completely focused on the "location" at hand and just cranking through stuff.  Having to sift through one big list looking for "client" tasks so I can earn an income is not so helpful when my time is limited and I get paid by the hour.  ;)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Gretchen<br>It's nice to hear from you again.  I'm totally sympathetic to your logic and methodology....maybe because our brains are similarly encoded how to categorize and manipulate knowledge and needs into desired action.  Everybody navigates their life according to how their minds "present" it to them!  LOL!  Like you, I fare much better when a have a target to aim at.  It can be either a type of work to get done, or whatever work is needed to accomplish a goal.  (Most of my goals can be loosely categorized into either responsibilities to meet or accomplishments that feature my values or passions as the work's matrix.<br>Another trouble I had with the AF list, is the continuing deciding process of "what to do next?"  Deciding is a higher order of thinking and having to break my work momentum every time I completed a task to switch back into decision making mode.....SLOWED my efficiency down quite a bit!  I like to have at least and hour or two of determined goals in my head to drive my efforts.  I get FAR MORE ACCOMPLISHED when I already KNOW what I'm trying to accomplish without interrupting my flow with......What to do next every few minutes.  Even if my pain forces me to work in small bursts or I'm corralling my donkey or monkey mind, at least my mind is set up and geared toward completing something to my satisfaction.  The AF method fractured my focus and I never had that "job well done" feeling no matter how hard or how long I worked.  (Perhaps my brain damage might have played a part.  The list always morphed into forgotten chaos.  I always preferred a definite target.....now I actually NEED one!  *blush*<br>I love your way of expressing getting your work done "cranking stuff out"......YES!!!  It's quite satisfying to feel that your efforts are streamlined and focused.  It feels quite similar to playing sports.  Your mind and body are in concert like a heat-seeking missle aiming to blast it's target!  I actually LOVE the sensation of knowing that my efforts are going to culminate in success!  Aaaahhhhhh!  "......well done!"  I LOVE that feeling!  Many times I'm forced to settle for getting the work accomplished far less elegantly....but at least I kept my resolve intact!  *blush*<br>learning as I go</div>
