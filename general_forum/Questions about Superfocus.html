<div class="content">I'm only on Day 2 of using Superfocus, but have some comments and questions (to which I couldn't find the answers in "How to work the system").<br><br>1. "Start work on page 1 by considering each task in turn until one of them feels ready to be done."  Presumably this means in either or both columns, as the spirit moves me?  I would tend to tackle column 2 first, as it contains priority items.<br><br>2. "If it is a recurring task, re-enter it at the end of your list in Column 1."  What if it's an urgent recurring task?  Wouldn't it make more sense to enter it in Column 2?<br><br>3. Superfocus - like AF - doesn't deal with items which can't be tackled until some future date.  I use a desk diary to list such items under the appropriate future date, and have a recurring SF item to remind me to check the desk diary daily.<br><br>4. Which brings me to my last question, also on recurring items.  The system doesn't allow them to recur daily, weekly, etc.  A daily item could therefore fall to be actioned within hours or days.  If it comes up too soon, should I leave it there, or delete it and add it to the end of the relevant column?<br><br>The system is working fine so far, but I'm having to make small adaptation to deal with these issues.<br><br>It also made me realise a basic dilemma which Mark has with these systems.  Either he gives a general outline and invites users to develop their own system based on these general principles, or he lays down hard and fast rules.  Mark tends to do the latter, which is fine; but if you lay down rules, you need to cover everything in a very logical way - and I speak from experience, as I'm a solicitor who specialises in drafting contracts.  This is not easy, as I found when trying to reproduce the system on a flowchart (an attempt I eventually abandoned).</div>

Then continue circulating. If you think about it, the sequence is ...121212121212 whether you start at column 1 or column 2, so it doesn't really make any difference which you do first.<br><br><<  "If it is a recurring task, re-enter it at the end of your list in Column 1."

So they have to do it to the best of their understanding and then re-read the rules to make sure they are doing it right, then repeat as necessary.</div>

<div class="content">I'd like to humbly offer an additional suggestion on recurring tasks. I have a recurring reminder that pops up to tell me about the task. When it pops up, it reminds me to add the task to my SF list. I personally put these tasks of mine into C2 of the next page but you may choose a different spot based on how quickly you cycle through your list. It's probably best to use Seraphim's "apprehension" guideline. (Was "apprehension" the term used?) Since I'm too lazy to search for Seraphim's exact words, I'll paraphrase:<br><br>"Put it at the end of C1 unless you feel apprehensive that you won't get to it in time. If you do, but it in C2 on the next page unless you feel apprehensive that you won't get to it in time. If you do, put it in C2 of the current page unless you feel apprehensive that you won't get to it in time. If you do, do it now."</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Mark - I seem to be on the right track in what I've been doing.  (You are right about contracts, but in that case the main thing is to ensure the judge understands it correctly.)<br><br>jFenter's point is essentially a definition of "urgent" - describes a task which you feel apprehensive about delaying.  I find that for at least 90% of my tasks I have no difficulty whatever in classifying them as urgent or not urgent - there seem to be very few grey areas.</div>

<div class="content">Hi jFenter<br><< It's probably best to use Seraphim's "apprehension" guideline. (Was "apprehension" the term used?) >><br><br>Seraphim used the word "anxious" in his post <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1478460#post1480893" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1478460#post1480893</a> . Bernie called it Seraphim's "anxiety" criterion. I'm using it on my SF list. ;-)</div>
