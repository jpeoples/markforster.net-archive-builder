<div class="content">Hi all, thought I'd post this as a bit of diversionary fun.  When I was a kid I used to love making flexagons, after reading about them in a Martin Gardner book.  If you've not seen these before take a look at this<br><br>  <a href="http://pjmedia.com/lifestyle/2012/10/01/video-october-is-the-month-of-the-flexagon/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://pjmedia.com/lifestyle/2012/10/01/video-october-is-the-month-of-the-flexagon/</a><br><br>Here's a good guide to making them which I like because it just uses a fold to get the initial 60 degree corner which saves messing around with a protractor or a pair of compasses<br><br>  <a href="http://soe.ucdavis.edu/almendle/docs/Flexagons.pdf" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://soe.ucdavis.edu/almendle/docs/Flexagons.pdf</a><br><br>You could make a trihexaflexagon and label the three sides RELAX, CYCLE and BLITZ!! and stick it to your screen to remind what approach you're currently taking to your tasks.  Flex it into blitz mode and nail a few!  Then flip it into relax mode for a bit.  Or make a hexahexaflexagon which gives you six ways to work, three of which appear commonly, the other three being much more elusive!<br><br>On the other hand, if you have young kids, try giving your tasks a miss for the day and sitting with them and making some of these together, colouring them in and writing secret messages on them.  Great fun!<br><br>Happy flexing!</div>
