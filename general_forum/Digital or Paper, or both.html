<div class="content">When I studied chemistry I learnd tons of chemical formulas.<br>Handwriting each of them  20 or 30 times repeatedly made them stick to my memory for years. So, yes, handwriting is better for learning than just reading.</div>

<div class="content">I also much prefer handwriting for writing first drafts, though the subsequent editing and revision is best done by wordprocessor.<br><br>My handwriting also has the great advantage that no one can read it except me!</div>

<div class="content">Yep, the old ways are sometimes the best.  I sometimes write in capitals on my tablet notebook computer (NOT an iPad), as I do with ink handwriting, but even so, not everyone can read it!<br><br>Yesterday I had to work out an Excel formulae with 'nested' IF THEN ELSE logic to about five levels which I haven't done for some time.  <br><br>I started off (I'm 63) with sitting down (I usually work at the computer standing in office and at home, for the past year anyway, recommended) and writing out the logic on paper, helped a lot, then only had to sort out the syntax in the formulae.<br><br>A clean sheet of paper is still nice as a starting point for anything, although I do embrace IT as much as I can.</div>

<div class="content">my handwriting is terrible too. It's a great advantage for me because i read it much faster than words on a computer. I like handwriting for stuff which need me energy. Collect things, creating, thinking about options. I like heuristic schemes too. They help me to do think fast and easy. <br><br>It is difficult to choose between digital and hand writing. I guess i am like MF. When I need to be natural, active i use handwriting. I use digital or everything which must be structured and of course for communication.  also use digital for storing file about things i need to keep. <br><br>Years ago there was no computer. I let you imagine how my office was and how much time it tooks me to clean all that stuff. Today it's much simpler. <br><br>My office desck is pretty but it is small so using computer help me to clean it and is easy for finding my information. Also it's easy to carry it out when i am out if I need it ie on iphone.<br><br>Finally after a long time searching how to do things i found my own way and explained inthis topic. <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1262693" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1262693</a></div>
