In long list systems the aim is to write everything down that you have to do, want to do or think you might do in one long list in no particular order. There should be no attempt to categorise, prioritise, or emphasise particular tasks in any way. There are no rules about what size individual tasks have to be or how they should be worded.

<div class="content">From the instructions for the Final Version, it looks like the Final Version is also a catch-all list: <br><br><FV is based on my earlier time management systems, particularly the extensive range of AutoFocus and SuperFocus systems developed over the last three years. These were unique in that they were constantly developing with the assistance of a large band of commenters on my web-site. Anyone who has tried one or more of these systems will recognize the strong family resemblance that they have with FV. The most striking resemblance is that they are all based on one long list (either paper or electronic) which can be used to capture just about every possible action that springs into one's mind. ></div>

<div class="content">Mark H.:<br><br>The Long List is the catch all list. It's the same thing. <br><br>When talking about the Long List, people here usually talk about a catch all list. One list where you just write down every task you want to have written down. You will not find a single example where Mark Forster refers to a Long List as anything else, AFAIK.<br><br>This is also apparent, when you read through the rules for the respective time management systems.</div>

<div class="content">Christopher, <br><br>Thanks for your reply. <br><br>The reason I am wondering about this is because Mark Forster in the forum threads would say to only have on the list things you are currently working on.  There were a number of times he wrote this.  It never was clear in mind what list this was, or where he parked items before putting it on the list. <br><br>He did say this explicitly about AF4, and when others in the thread objected that the Autofocus rules state that it is catch-all list, he said AF1 was catch-all list. <br> <br>Although he seemed to have originally intended for the Final Version to be a long list, catch-all list, I would think with this list a catch-all list be too long for a chain. <br><br>And with the same thing with the Zero Resistance method, and New Question method - there would be a lot of items on a catch-all list that I would no resistance to doing, or resist not doing.</div>

<div class="content">I have mainly been using Autofocus or Simple Scanning, <br>but when I have tried the Final Version the chain is over so many pages that I would lose my place. <br>And making the chain would take too long. <br><br>I would think the Final Version, Zero Resistance, New Question would work better with only active tasks, or tasks that ready to start.</div>
