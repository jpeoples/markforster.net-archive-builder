<div class="content">I have trie a nice experience today. Just for fun as I began a new note book :-))<br><br>I chose a nice note book mine are spiral A4 little square paper notebook from Oxford 100% recycled. More I am getting old more I am a protector of the planet. :-)<br><br>On the right page I put at the top the date<br><br>Then I put all task wich were on my mind exactly like with AF<br>Starting my task by keyword such as W (Wait), Call, T for office tasks, Follow, @ for mac and emails. at the end of the task I put the deadline when there was one.  <br>One line per task no control, no thinking just reporting one by one. <br>I also put Important projects with no details just like goals.<br>When I treat it I treat it as I like by context, one by one and if nothing stand by me the all daily page is dismiss. <br><br>If I have to add some thing on the daily list I just add it at the end f the daily page. That's all. <br><br>In fact it is like an AF with close list by day. <br><br>I kept the left page of the note book put also the date and took all my notes as a summary like leonardo di vinci did. <br><br><a href="http://lsc.sas.cornell.edu/Sidebars/Study_Skills_Resources/cornellsystem.pdf" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://lsc.sas.cornell.edu/Sidebars/Study_Skills_Resources/cornellsystem.pdf</a><br><br>Then I worked and worked very well. Much better since a long time. <br><br>At the end of the day I jump a line and put tomorrow's date. I put all deadlines and things I was waiting for + reported what I had really to do erasing what was on the previous list. <br><br>I have a strange feeling tonight. I have the feeling of being quiet and peaceful. All is under control. <br><br>Tomorrow I will begin by my tomorrow tasks and after will go to the old list and treat it as I did with sf including dismissing. For future task I will put them on tomorrow list without caring and will report them on my diary if needed. If there is an urgency I do it immediately. <br><br>Simples systems are the best. Why do I have to make it complicated ?</div>

<div class="content">On tomorrow list I just made a brainstorming then there are 4 new tasks but only 2 must be done tomorrow, I put a dash in front of it to do it first in the morning. I also put a dash in front of each task of the previous day unfinished or urgent to do absolutely tomorrow I will begin by them. I also put a dash in front of each important notes I really need to treat tomorrow.</div>

<div class="content">Second DAY with my kind of AF revisited. <br><br>I just finished my review crossed the must do task and reported them on tomorrow list. <br><br>Today I did all what I intended to do ie the tasks I reported yesterday. <br>I also did a lot of tasks written on monday and tuesday <br>I tried to work the list as we did with AF4 but the list was so small (one page) that it was un useful. A treatment like AF was sufficient. <br><br>From Monday many tasks will be soon dismiss but i did not yet dismiss them because some of them are still standing at me not because I am reluctant todo them but because the will be actionable in the near future. <br><br>Today's list is clear. I crossed many lines and did a real good job with it. <br>There are now some waiting tasks from people, some tasks I intend to do but not sure to do it now, and as I said some erased and reported task on tomorrow list which are MUST DO tasks. <br><br>This review and report took me only 10 mn and this is great !<br><br>I will tonight work on my dream list which is on my ipad. <br>I am not easy with the method because i did not take time to read the big notice of Mark but I red it summary ! <a href="http://www.israelkeys.com/blog/2011/03/how-to-make-your-dreams-come%C2%A0true/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.israelkeys.com/blog/2011/03/how-to-make-your-dreams-come%C2%A0true/</a><br><br>The notes I took on the left page are great. Today I needed a number I wrote on monday and find it immediately. It is a progress :-)</div>

<div class="content">hello - I'm new member of this forum. just joined today. was intending to join at some time, & this post encouraged that time as now.<br><br>I've posted at least once in the past, before login was needed (and I've seen why!) likely under Matthew.<br><br>been following this site, on/off, for a couple of years. for me, what was mind opening, was the concept of self testing and refining a methodology.<br><br>I did work with AutoFocus, however my sticking point was it was fine for focused in close day to day on a project, but how to handle multiple projects across time? I did ask about this and was suggested something like use whatever project management and calendar system I like best.<br><br>And THAT is the issue for me. I don't have one, or ever really grok how to use calendar to best results. seems like one of those things that is so obvious that everyone knows how to use it. but do they?<br><br>So MY self testing and refining a methodology has been to those ends.<br><br>The latest if I'm understanding correctly, being similar to what Jupiter has posted here.<br><br>----------<br><br>1. start similar to AutoFocus with a list of everything & then make sub list of what I will do today<br><br>2. and then just pick one thing to do<br><br>3. do it<br><br>4. go back to list and consider what next<br><br>yes, perhaps this just sounds like standard to do system. but for me at least, I needed to re-invent it and understand it. and through the lens and method of AutoFocus.<br><br>(and now also Dreams, thanks for that, reading and re-rearding slowly)<br><br>thank you Mark Forster & all others in this forum</div>

<div class="content">Let's see if I understand you:<br>You have a big ongoing list. <br>Each day you pick out a small list of  things you want to do. <br>You choose one, do that, and go back again to the small list. <br><br>Is that right?  Sounds a bit like Do It Tomorrow. <br>Contrariwise, I'm currently running a system where I grab tasks one at a time from various pages of the big list, and gradually build up the short active list over the course of the day.</div>

<div class="content">@Alan Baljeu<br><br>I think reading about Do It Tomorrow is what got me to discover this site originally, it was some article regarding email. I'll need to read up on it again.<br><br>do you understand what I'm doing? sort of... I gave a simplified description<br>that is the core structure<br>it is extendable across time<br>I'm trying, although does not yet feel right, have a system that works for long term planning & daily implementation<br><br>life list [be fit]<br>big list [pushups, swimming, rock climb, run marathon]<br>month list [pushups: become daily habit as a way of being in shape]<br>week list [get started with pushups, work into it carefully]<br>today list [add a pushups log page to my binder, do one pushup]<br><br>and this is flexible, when making the week list, you might put down<br>monday: pushup time 3-3:30 1 pushup<br>tuesday: pushup time 3-3:30 2 pushups<br>...<br>or just refer to the weekly each day:  [get started with pushups, work into it carefully] & then just each day do pushups whenever/however based on how feel about it from yesterday/today<br><br>so should be able to schedule things out in detail as needed - planning a wedding, while keeping everything else loose as with the do what want when want as feels right<br><br>yet, keeps overall structure based on time<br><br>time also being flexible. could be year/month/week/day/now<br>but also could, as needed, use quarter, next 2 weeks, this weekend, tonight, while visiting my father<br><br>this being in "theory" as I find when I try to get all the elements, projects, schedule and such all figured out, I get overwhelmed & never exactly nail it<br><br>so, mostly living at the level of a list and day list<br><br>I also have some pure "project" pages. where I track the steps of an actual project. this would be lost if all tossed into a big list<br><br>finally, while I do use computer and iPhone and tried too many iPhone organizer apps, I'm trying to build this system in paper first. otherwise I get sucked into computer fiddly issues and also have trouble getting sense of the big picture.</div>

<div class="content">+JMJ+<br><br>Jupiter, Alan & Matthew:<br><br>That's weird, those are almost how DECAF is (<a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1537552" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1537552</a> )<br><br>1. Make a big list of all your tasks.<br>2. From that big list, make a small list.<br>3. From the small list, choose one and do it.<br>4. Go back to step 3<br>5. If done with all of the small list, go back to step 2.<br><br>The difference is:<br><br>6. Once you do not feel doing any task left in the small list, mark them as High Resistance Tasks.<br>7. Determine later why these tasks are Highly Resistant, then re-define them or delete them.<br>8. Go back to step 2.<br><br>Steps 6-8 tries to integrate the Dreams idea of treating problems/resistance as friends trying to tell you something.<br><br>AND OH, you guys do realize that these systems are not something new but was actually thought of by 2mc as his "Flagged" AF1 variant (<a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1423027" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1423027</a> ), right?<br><br>God bless.</div>

<div class="content">matthewS<br><br>I'm sorry to say that it sounds like exactly the sort of thing I was trying to get away from when I developed Autofocus!<br><br>I discourage people from overplanning simple things. Overplanning does *not* make it easier to do high resistance tasks. In fact it has a tendency to increase your resistance to *everything* you do.<br><br>All you need in order to do pushups is to put "Do Pushups" on your AF list. Or alternatively do them at a specific time each day, in which case you don't even need to put them on the list. <br><br>As for organizing a wedding, all you need to do is make a list of things to do and put them on the AF list. My daughter got married in May, so I know what I'm talking about here!</div>

<div class="content">Hi all<br><br>Just to say that there is a little misunderstand I guess. <br><br>I work with an AF list except that it is cut by day.<br>When I plan my tomorrow's day (each nigh) I don't extract everything I wana do. I just extract what I absolutely must do. I could avoid this just dashing tasks like 2mc which is a good system. <br><br>I simply noticed that with this system I have a better control of each day which works like a close list and urgencies are treated because they are done first. Also the system helps me to dismiss. I nearly dismissed monday I only have 2 standing items. <br><br>I chose to go back to the basic AF because I became really uncomfortable with the 2 columns of SF but I am impatient to see what MF imagined for AF5.</div>

<div class="content">Third DAY with my kind of AF revisited. <br><br>I just finished my review crossed the must do task and reported them on tomorrow list. <br><br>Today I did all what I intended to do ie the tasks I reported yesterday. <br><br>Old tasks<br>Monday and tuesday are dismissed. <br>Wednesday and thursday are actionable. <br>There is a dash in front of each actionable task (none on dismiss - I had one I reported on tomorrow's list).<br><br>Future tasks (Thursday)<br>Tomorrow dash will be done FIRST then I will review the dismiss (dashed) and follow AF rules. <br><br>I have reported on my AF list task such as tomorrow's appointments and waiting for items I might receive tomorrow ie account of the company and a answer about a proposal. <br><br>I still feel very quiet with the system. My executive notes (summarized) are indeed operational. I needed another information today about the price of a building and found i immediately while I was on call with my client. I had a very constructive call with a real estate advisor who spoke monday about a list of 8 topics (!) and I checked all of them with him at a glance he was stuck ! so do I. <br><br>I did not work on my dream I will tonight if I can find a little time for it...<br><br>With this new way of doing thing I have indeed a real improvement in my job. Before I felt like a salmon struggling against the river I am now diving into it and choosing my path little by little. It is a real improvement. It is much better than with Omnifocus where the system was organized but I could not feel anything about my work. I felt like beeing controled by omnifocus but with my new paper system I feel like controlling my work.<br><br>Also, Closing the list each night (ie adding tomorrows's date) give me a real sense of time. <br>Today a client asked me about a notes I wrote on monday and I answered it immediately because I new that the note was on monday's note. It is much better than what I did before on the computer because I decided immediately about what to do and reported it on my AF list. So The job was very well done. <br><br>At last I feel very quiet at night when I close my office. I know everything is on AF so I am very peaceful and I sleep much better. I know that I can include on the flow an AIM instead of a task which may be a real priority and then I will do it tomorrow If and only if,  I really have to do it. <br><br>I dont know what gona be AF5 but I hope to keep my closing list day by day. <br><br>Cheers to all<br><br>Jupiter.</div>

<div class="content">Let me take this out of the theoretical (for me). I have NOT planned a wedding, just seemed like a complex enough project that it would need planning. And the pushup example only came to mind from the 100 Push-Up challenge posts.<br><br>I'm a design consultant. At any time there might be 3-5 clients, with several projects. There is all the background business/office stuff. Upgrade software, backups, organize files, invoice, marketing for new work, write some new stuff on blog...<br><br>When I was younger, I did have trouble meeting deadlines, but that is no longer an issue. Client work will get done, on time. But there is so much else to life that seems to slip away. The non urgent, yet important, or whatever Covey calls them. The very short term does happen, I want to go for a walk, so then I do. But the long term is hard to solve. Change the kind of clients I get, the kind of work I do. Art/painting shows and other non profit projects. Travel, both to local parks and to Japan, London. Personal growth, biking, healthier diet and such. I'll focus on one, then the others slip.<br><br>I seem to be pushed about by whatever comes my way, and want to have a longer term way to know what I'm doing in the now, yet it safely takes into account the multiple ongoing interleaved projects of life, some long, some short, some personal, some business, some known and fixed, some speculative.<br><br>As with this post <a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2008/2/21/project-management.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2008/2/21/project-management.html</a> about DIT not intended for project planning, that is, I guess, what I'm seeking, the day-to-day, "manage yourself within a project" AND the long term project planning. Also, while I'm writing this, to solve WHAT the long term should be. Yes, I read Dreams, loved it, re-reading, and the answer is in there. Trying to integrate all of this.<br><br>(and I do apologize to anyone if what I'm describing is an already existing method)<br><br>thank you, MatthewS</div>

<div class="content">@Jupiter. is each day in your system a new page? or is each day something where you draw a line under the end of the current day?<br><br>if it is draw a line under the current day, then how are you able to put something on a day that is 2 days from now, next week or next month? or is it not that kind of system?</div>

<div class="content">hi Mathiew<br><br>my system is like an autofocus list. ie a simple list where i put everything which comes to my mind one task per line, one after each other. except that at the end of the day i just drop a line (i dont draw) and i put the New date ie tommorow s date.<br>then I read today s list if there is very future item (in a month it goes on a special .Txt list ) on my computer. example it s gona be soon the hollidays, i have a list call september a,nd another call holliday full of reported tasks coming from my autofocus list.<br><br>for my projects i have the list of them for the moment on omnifocus but i could have them on a simple list and a folder also on txt or even on mindmapinf if they are complex.<br><br>the basic idea is to stay with my af list why ? just because it works. <br>i own my own company. i work a lot. i have over 175 projects but for my core business i truth autofofus. the system free my intuition, and for me nothing is worth than that.<br><br>the last stone of my organisation is DREAM. I did it recently and like it very much. <br>as for af Mf have invented a fantastic method. Since i do it i feel much better. the system is more efficient for me than the areas of gtd which were to complex for me.</div>

<div class="content">matthewS:<br><br>If you have more work than you have hours to do it then one or other (or all) of the following may be involved:<br><br>a. You have too much work. Remedy: Audit every commitment you  have and make sure it justifies the time you spend on it. Concentrate on what actually produces the results you want. Forget everything else.<br><br>b. You are not working efficiently. Remedy: Examine your systems for *everything* - from the way you handle new clients to the way you get your milk for your cup of tea. Faulty or sub-optimal systems are major time wasters - and can even be fatal to a business.<br><br>c. You are not leaving enough time to do the work. Remedy: Don't over-schedule. Remember the whole point of meetings is to produce work, so wall-to-wall meetings are bound to be a disaster. Every meeting must justify the time spent on it (including preparation, travel and follow-up time).<br><br>Your audits of all these things and the resulting action can all be organised through your SF/AF list.</div>

But I gonna try. <br><br>1. There are projects. Projects are in the GTD meaning something you need to do which require 2 or more tasks. <br><br>2. There are tasks.  they may be by contexts or one by one. <br><br>I have a digital system which is Omnifocus. It 's a GTD tool organized by contexts, and projects and start and due date. I made it operational because I wished to have a centralized system and following projects. So it is simple to follow projects, put a start date, tasks, and do them by context or with an AF perspective. For doing it is simple to extract by date or projects what you really want to do and report it on SF<br>The same thing can be done with toodledoo or any good project manager. <br><br>You could think OK Jupiter has found his way and h's satisfied. I am not. <br>This system take too much work to make it works properly. Contexts and AF list (I made a perspective for this) doesn't suits me in action. Putting my stuff is a data base is like putting a stuff in a huge warehouse you can't see anything. <br><br>So am am thinking of an other way. <br>I will keep my 2 projects lists. They are great checklists.<br>one is a list for actionable project (like an AF list) and the other isa list of non actionable projects. <br><br>I think I will use 2 tools mindmap for bigs projects plans and strategy. <br>Dream for thinking and controlling with words, <br>Evernote project or .txt files I still don't know if i will chose one or the other for projects and historical notes about them. Ical for deadlines. Ticker on a .txt file as I do today when I need to push later some tasks like I did with my september list and holliday's list (when the month will happen I will report the all list on AF - there are about 20 tasks today)<br><br>And for ACTION my paper AF list.<br>Paper is much faster and free my intuition while OF  doesn't.<br>And most important I have a tendency to be contemplative. Ie I can stay for hours in front of my desk without really working or doing something less important than my own job like surfing or thinking or writing on this forum, what I do now at 11h35 AM instead of calling my clients ;-). Working with AF or SF force me to work effectively. OF or every kind of digital solution encourages this kind of contemplation. It is really my biggest problem. I could work less and much better if I really would.</div>

<div class="content">Hi all<br><br>I began my system on monday july 4 th. We are sunday it's time for a checking.<br><br>I still stick with my system which is AF except that I close the day each night dropping a line and adding a new date.  By certain way my system is near Alan's system. It is funny that we arrived together at the same point.<br><br>The system has perfectly worked this week. I did what I had to do. I dismiss what I needed too. I also drop 2 or 3 urgencies but not matter they were done the next day what let me think that they were not so urgent !.<br><br>Comparing my paper system with my old digital system (omnifocus) is more a question of feeling than organization. Having written all my task this week on AF and reported someone on a simple .txt file for september gives me a real feeling of peace. I have the feeling of controlling my work and stay creative because it still free my intuition. May be this feeling is because of the close lists. Has all tasks has been reported each day I have an anchor to feel when I wrote the task, when I crossed it (I put the date when I need it) and what is the next action. <br><br><br>If I do the same exercise with Omnifocus I feel a very well organized and structured system, may be the best I have ever done, almost perfect (for me) but I feel about it completely cold with the system. No feeling, no control (I can't feel the datas) and so on. <br><br>I don't know how long I will stick with the system but for the moment cording to my activities it is almost perfect.<br><br>My efforts are now about dismissing. It is an exercise that has always been difficult for me. I decided to dismiss day by day. <br><br>Good week end to all.</div>

<div class="content">Jupiter - idea for your system and question.<br><br>instead of draw line at end if day, have a page per day.<br><br>Otherwise, how to place something on next week Wednesday?<br><br>Yes, you have a far future list of September. But what of near future: next week or even tomorrow?<br><br>The negative of this idea of page a day is what it needs more space or mostly empty? Although could add pages as needed in loose leaf binder if needs more space.<br><br>Or could have near future page, with line or two per date, just as you have month sheet. Perhaps this is what you do? And certainly, even if DO use daily planner, still may want a page for September instead of pre schedule all of September when it is currently July.<br><br>What do you do for future tasks, that are not so far in the future as September?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Matthews. I have found a way to solve all that and it works great. <br><br>So the systems works like this<br>1. Take a spiral note book<br>2. Start putting in the top middle of the page today's date let's say MONDAY<br>3. Do a double margin small, vertically on the left part <br>- First colum = 2 cm<br>- Second column = 1cm<br>First column is for date, secont colum is for context ie @ = web/ Mac, Call, WAIT, <br>4. Put everything like you wanna do with AF1 it is your open list. <br>5. During the day re formulate items, if something is in the future dont care just put on the first column the date. I put monday, tuesday and so on, september and so on. <br>6. Work on each item like you usually do. <br>7. at the end of the day put tomorrows's day<br>8. Cross from the previous day each item you must do tomorrow.<br>10. Put in the new date nothing but what you must do or if you prefer dont report but dash every items you must do. You can do both report some and cross or let it in the backlog and dash. it is up to you. I report all what is in time burst. <br>11. Then the previous day becomes your backlog. <br>12.Now Imagine now you are the next day lets say tuesday<br>13. Start backward items reported first, then dashed from Tuesday to monday. <br>14. Cross, reformulate, feel free to do watever you want to follow <br>15. If you find a project circle it to find it easely. <br>16. In the list put your project's task if you can together when you do your brainstorming at night.<br>17. If you pass threw a day ie monday and nothing stand at you dismiss the all tasks of the day with a yellow highliner they are non actionable but subject to review<br>18. If you have a real deadline put it on your diary as an appointment. <br>19. If you must call some a certain day at a certain time put it in your diary<br>20. each night have a look at your diary and work on the appointments <br>21. Report on AF revisited every thing you must do. You can group by project. ie preparing an appointment you will treat them at a batch. <br>22 If you have some projects and need to put your bigs rocks on it use the note part (left of the page) and put the big rocks you will see the advancement of he project little by little. <br>23. Then read from monday to tuesday in the normal way and do the same. <br>24. Go to 4<br><br>The system is incredibly efficient. Still I work like this i work very fast.<br>It is great.</div>

<div class="content">Ouaouuuh I had to work very intensively today. AF revisited with my double columns and day separation worked incredibly well. The dismissing was perfect. I did all urgencies. I worked on 2 majors project. I am very satisfied with the system. My notes are also almost perfect. I also chose to stop doing 2 projects for doing them later. I am very quiet thanks to the system.</div>

<div class="content">The tips I use are the one MF use with pages AF and SF ie cross / Cross+circle/ dismissing in yellow except :  I use green for waiting context and pink just to highline the dates and nothing else....<br><br>I also use the link MF use to join to tasks which are crossed. <br><br>Then nothing really new under the sun except that the flow of work is incredibly fast and as each list is treated like a mini AF list I dont miss any urgencies and I dot have to report them on the next page.</div>
