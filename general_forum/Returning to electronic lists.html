<div class="content">After a few months with a handwritten notebook, I have been finding serious productivity drawbacks due to lack of flexible filtering, and am going back to electronic. I may well keep a notepad as a book of first entry, and transfer to electronic as and when there is time. Will use ListPro again, with Excel as second choice. TodoPaper/TaskPaper are strong contenders but don't have a mobile option.</div>

<div class="content">The eternal battle between paper an digital rages on. ;-)<br><br>I'm also very fond right now of the advantages of my digital list, especially for DWM - automatic backup/syncing, automatic insertion of new tasks a the right place, automatic dismissal, associating applications, documents and web pages with tasks and launch them automatically. I always try Mark's systems on paper first (except DWM in fact), but I always quickly switch to digital because keeping my list on paper feels like a chore and having it digital feels like a smooth cruise. But of course, that's a matter of personal preference and I'm glued to my PC for most of the day, so other people experience drawbacks in the digital approach that I don't.</div>
