<div class="content">In the Secrets book, it is recommended to practice low-level systems until they are second nature.  Several examples are given.  <br>The questioning method of the low-level systems is also recommended.<br>Should the low-level systems be handled separately on a separate list(s) rather than integrated with other items, so they can be practiced in order, and so if questioned they can be improved? <br>Does this include any daily routines? <br>It seems that this is almost the same as habit formation, or is there a difference?</div>

<div class="content">In SoPP, a low level system is any foundational routine, practice, or habit that deals with some aspect of your life. In particular, I would say the primary low level system that is emphasized the most in that book is your time management system (SoPP give the PTMS, or 5/2 no-list method). So, whether or not to use separate lists to manage habits or not is in itself a low level system subject to questioning.</div>

<div class="content">Mark H.:<br><br>I think this depends on what each system demands. For example: email.<br><br>Let's say you use FVP or GTD. "Should" email-to-reply-to be a separate list? With those systems I would enter each email as a task into the long list.<br><br>If I use a NL system, then of course email-to-reply-to would be it's own list, probably a label in my email app or similar.<br><br>So, as Aaron Hsu already wrote, each of these systems would be subject to questioning and they would influence each other. No hard rules.</div>
