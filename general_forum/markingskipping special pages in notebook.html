<div class="content">In my SuperFocus notebook, I have a few pages that are for special purposes, not part of my todo list. For example, a page listing things that make me happy, a wish-list of things to buy - information that is very useful to have in my notebook but that I don't want to look at when I'm working through my todo list.<br><br>I've developed a simple way for both marking those pages to find them quickly when I want them, and at the same time easily flipping past them when I want to look at only my SuperFocus pages.<br><br>My special pages are always a pair of facing pages - i.e., when my notebook is open to one of the special pages, I am not seeing any of the tasks in my SuperFocus lists.<br><br>For each special page, I take a Post-It note, fold it in half with the sticky side OUTWARDS, and stick it at the top of the special page so that it glues that page closed. I leave the edge of the Post-It sticking out to make a tab, and I write a brief page title on the tab.<br><br>When I'm turning pages while using SuperFocus, I don't see the special pages because the Post-It notes keep them closed, but when I want one of them I can find it quickly by looking for its tab, and then of course the Post-It can be easily pulled off one side to let me open the page.<br><br>I also use this for facing pages that contain nothing but dismissed items. Again, it lets me ignore those pages when actioning todos, and lets me find them quickly when reviewing dismissed items. If I wasn't too lazy to go shopping, I'd buy Post-Its of a different colour for my dismissed pages. :)<br><br>You could probably do something similar with paper clips (perhaps colour-coded plastic ones for different types of pages), but I don't want paper clip indentations on my expensive and incredibly gorgeous Paperblanks notebook. :)<br><br>I'm not sure how well I've described this, so tell me if you want clarification!</div>

<div class="content">Alys:<br><br>Sounds a great idea, Alys. If you would like to send me a photo or photos of your notebook showing how the tabs work I'll put them on the website.</div>

<div class="content">I use colored paperclips, and also movable index tabs.</div>
