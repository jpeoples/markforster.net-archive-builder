<div class="content">Hi - I just finished the first draft of a special report and am interested in getting some feedback. It's entitled "Can Time Be Managed? - An Inquiry Into the Definition of Time-Based Productivity."<br><br>As you probably know, David Allen and others have said (more than once) that time cannot be managed. However, Wikipedia also lists him as the creator of a "time management method known as Getting Things Done."<br><br>This kind of anomaly got me thinking... where is the scientific evidence that time cannot be managed? If you are a bit geeky like me, you may also have wondered the same. It let me to take a deep dive into unfamiliar fields of physics/relativity, philosophy, linguistics, sociology, psychology and a few more.<br><br>The result is a first draft of some 17,000 words. In it, I look at the definition of words like "time" and "management", and "time management" in what you may call a "stretch project." This draft is rough... I appear to have reached my limit and need some help to take it the next step, if I decide to bring it to a final form. Hence this invitation to help me make it better!<br><br>You can let me know you'd like to join in the "fun" at <a href="http://ReplytoFrancis.info." target="new" rel="nofollow">http://ReplytoFrancis.info.</a> Please include a paragraph letting me know why you have an interest in the topic. An email will be sent to me automatically.<br><br>Thanks<br><br>Francis<br>Twitter - @fwade</div>
