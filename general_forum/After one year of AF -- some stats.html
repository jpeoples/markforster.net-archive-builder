<div class="content">Tomorrow 5/01 it will be exactly one year since the initial beta test release of the original AF (now known as AF1). I've used it (at work only) since day one, and stayed with AF1 for most of the year. I skipped AF2 and after a short trial of AF3, I switched back to AF1. I finished 2009 with AF4.<br><br>Just for fun, here are some statistics from one year of AF use:<br>* 55 pages of 33 items each, 6 pages still active<br>* 1707 total items, of which 67 still open (i.e. an average of 9.7 items created per working day)<br><br>Tomorrow I'll begin my new working year, and I'm still undecided whether it will be with AF1 or AF4. But one thing is certain: I'll continue to use some form of AF, as it's the most effective system I've used (after GTD and DIT).</div>

<div class="content">"the most effective system I've used (after GTD and DIT). "  Do you mean to say GTD and DIT are more effective for you, and yet you prefer to use AF?</div>

<div class="content">I used "after" to imply chronology (my sentence was obvious to me when I typed it, but in retrospect it can indeed be confusing). What I meant to say is that I used AF after I'd used first GTD and then DIT.<br><br>GTD was an improvement over no system at all, although it lead to way too much tinkering on my Palm, and DIT was a big improvement over GTD. I still think DIT is quite a good system, but AF seems to be the ultimate (for now;).</div>

<div class="content">Hi Marc,<br>That's awesome progress!<br>What were your pros and cons of AF1 vs. AF4?<br>If you didn't have a lot of urgent tasks, which one would you use?<br>Also, did you use the system for most of your day, or just a part of it?</div>

<div class="content">Sorry for the late reply...<br><br>I tend to use AF for most of the (working) day.<br><br>The biggest advantage of AF1 (for me) is that it forces you to progress on at least one item for each page. I found this to be a huge procrastination buster. It helped me keep making progress on lots of (often smaller) initiatives in parallel, whereas otherwise only the ones that scream for attention the loudest get worked on. I feel this risk is more present in AF4, where you essentially only have the equivalent of 2 AF1 pages and consequently are less "forced" to work on the smaller things.<br><br>On the other hand, in AF1 the number of open pages with only a few items tended to increase a lot, and pages sometimes stayed open for months after their creation. Switching to AF4 helped me reduce the number of open pages very quickly to 5 or 6.<br><br>The dismissal style of AF4 leads me to write on a separate "someday/maybe" list a series of dismissed items I don't want to act on as yet, but which I don't want to lose. In AF1 this list would simply remain embedded in my AF list in the form of highlighted items. In both cases, I have a task in my system to regularly review these items; during this review I decide to drop some completely and to reactivate others.<br><br>For now, I continue to (loosely) follow AF4, but I'm still tempted by a return to AF1, as I never felt as productive as in the first 3 to 4 months of last year. Therefore I'd be curious to read Mark's conclusions about his (temporary?) return to AF1...</div>
