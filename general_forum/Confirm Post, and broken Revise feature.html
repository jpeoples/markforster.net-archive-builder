<div class="content">For the last few days, the system always asks me to enter a string of letters to confirm my posts.  At the same time, the "revise post" feature seems to have broken.  <br><br>Since we're all registered users, maybe the "confirm post" thing to avoid spam is unneeded?   <br><br>Or maybe Mark turned that feature on just temporarily, while he's on break, to avoid the need for cleaning up spam?</div>

<div class="content">I've no expeience with this variety of forum, but I'd bet you're right that he changed something while on break. <br><br>Since this is sort of a 'about the forum' thread and I'm new, I'll tag my question onto here...<br><br>Is there any way to figure out which forum posts you haven't read? I've resorted to putting the date and time of the last comment read on a sticky note on my computer (when I remember), and its extra confusing because (unless I've missed it) there's no way to change the time zone so the date/time recoded is not my reality. <br><br>Any tips?</div>

<div class="content">Another way to see  unread threads/posts is with this userscript, if your browser supports it: <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1019785" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1019785</a></div>
