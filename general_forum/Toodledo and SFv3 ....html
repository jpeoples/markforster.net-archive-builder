<div class="content">Sarah gave an outline of how she does SFv3 in Toodledo here <br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1379463?currentPage=3#post1407623" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1379463?currentPage=3#post1407623</a> ...<br><<I'm doing an electronic implementation in Toodledo, with a folder for each 25-item "page" and using task priorities to mimic two columns.>></div>

<div class="content">In fairness, I'm not the one who came up with the priorities to mimic columns idea - somebody else here mentioned it in passing, I can't remember who it was, and I ran with the idea.<br><br>The only problem I'm having with this is keeping "pages" to the appropriate length.  I can add tasks to the last "page" without ever looking at it so I don't notice when it goes over 25 items (my chosen page length).  Not a huge deal to fix when I come to that page (create a new folder, move all tasks past #25 to the new folder), but still a slight annoyance.</div>

<div class="content">Sarah,<br><br>I think it was me.<br><br>I do sometimes overshoot and have to retrospectively move a page of tasks (my process enters tasks without a page tag and tags them en masse when I reach 35.)</div>

<div class="content">That's right because you're using tags to indicate page numbers, I remember now!</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Will & Sarah.<br>Currently I'm using folders for projects and tags for location, for my DWM.<br>When I go SFv3, I think I'll go Sarah's way, folders for pageno and priorities for column.</div>

<div class="content">I see Rick Kotter is also implementing SFv3 in Toodledo. I wonder how he do it. Ref <a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2011/2/20/some-suggestions-for-what-next.html#comment11975498" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2011/2/20/some-suggestions-for-what-next.html#comment11975498</a> .<br><br>Anyway, I've just started moving my Toodledo DWM list to SFv3 ..<br>(1) I use folders ".01", ".02" etc for pages. Sorting the folders alphabetically allows my old folders used for project names to be sorted to the bottom.<br>(2) I set default for new tasks to have the last page folder number<br>(3) I use priority for columns, and will also use "negative" priority for dismissed tasks, that can be easily hidden.<br>(4) My screen shows about 18 tasks, so I decided to use that page length for now. <br>(5) My default view is by  "Folder", sorted by Folder|Forwards and Priority|Reverse, because I believe usually only column 1 fills up (not column 2). <br>(6) "Folder" view "All Tasks" tab and "Close Dividers", can give an overview numbers of tasks and those done for each page.<br><br>I did consider using tag for pageno instead of folder. But I didn't see much pros/cons for either tag/folder, so decided for the latter. Is there a clear advantage for using tags for pageno, Will?</div>

<div class="content">Further feedback on my SFv3 on TDD ...<br><br>I tried that Folder view, sorted by Folder|Forwards and Priority|Reverse for some time. But I find that the tasks are not consistently being sorted the same way. Without changing any task, a reload of the page gives a different sort. That bugged me.<br><br>I then tried Folder view, sorted by Folder|Forwards and DateModified|Forwards. Unfortunately that also didn't work well enough because it's really DateModified only, not Date+TimeModified.<br><br>I finally settled with Folder view, sorted by Folder|Forwards and Tag|Forwards. Folders are "01", "01a", "02", "02a" etc, where "01a" is Column 2 for page 01. Tags are "01", "02", "03" etc, keeping the task number for the page. I keep max 25 tasks per page. Since I hide completed tasks, this limit is really 25 "not-yet-done" tasks, that I hope would not adversely impact SFv3 flow.<br><br>Mmm, is there a better way of implementing SFv3 on TDD?</div>
