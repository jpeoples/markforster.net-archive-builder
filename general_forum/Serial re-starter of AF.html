<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-04-9 23:20</div>
<div class="content">I'm at the situation now where I have been trying to implement AF, had a bit of success for a couple of days, then I have a mad period with lots of urgent tasks, to the extent that  even capturing new tasks into AF stops, and I certainly stop reviewing the notepad.. so it falls by the wayside. In an effort to reboot and get back into it "afresh", I started a new AF notebook, growing the list gradually rather than copying everything into it. I've now done this 3 times.<br><br>Has anyone had this issue, and can you offer any advice re how can I get back into the swing again?...</div>

<div class="content">Hi, Carol, nice to hear from you again.<br><br>My general recommendation, whatever time management system you are using, is to write every task down before you start work on it. (Unless it's a real "immediate" task like evacuating the building when the fire alarm goes off). <br><br>Writing the tasks down helps stop one just reacting to tasks, which always results in that familiar fractured-day feeling ("I've been rushed off my feet all day, and haven't done a thing")<br><br>So where should you write them? I would suggest that you write them on the AF list UNLESS there is no real possibility of reaching them in time in the normal course of using the list. For those tasks which are too urgent to be written on the list itself, then I suggest you use a separate bit of paper (index card, bookmark or whatever) which you use as a supplement to the page you are currently working on.<br><br>This has a number of advantages:<br><br>1) It stops the AF system falling by the wayside when things get hectic.<br><br>2) Deciding whether to write the task on the main list or the supplement makes you consider just how urgent the task really is.<br><br>3) You are able to review your "urgent" tasks at the end of the day to see if they really were as urgent as you thought they were.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">There's an interesting contrast here. I never write stuff that I'm going to do now anyway; I only write stuff I might otherwise have to try to remember. Sometimes I'll do something before it's urgent, sometimes because I see it and my intuition says 'do it now'.<br><br>For me, this is the lowest overhead approach and, for me, the great advantage of AF is low overhead - so I see doing it this way as consistent with AF.<br><br>I don't have supplements, just AF. I do sometimes write out what I intend doing today - but that's not a list I work to, just a way or organising my thoughts. This 'today' list is informed by working with AF but also influenced by other factors like 'it's a sunny day today, I'm free to do what I want, so I'm going to spend a lot of time outside' as well as by jobs that have to be done today (I can check deadline tasks with one button of my electronic AF system - of course, the vast majority of tasks have no dates entered).<br><br>It also never bothers me if I spend a few days not looking at AF. I have 2 AFs - one for work and one for home - and often only look at one in a day and it is not unusual for me to look at neither - many of my workdays are tightly scheduled. I view AF as something that is there to help me, not me to act as its servant. But I do go through it fairly frequently, when I come across a task already done, I tick it, and in many ways it feels like I use it in a fairly pure way. I have no temptation to use another system with it.<br><br></div>

I have three AF lists, rarely do I get through one in a day, so this would apply to me and many others I'm sure. But I have been concerned that the additional page would grow to become a rival list. I've likewise avoided putting the same things at the top of every list.</div>

<div class="content">Laurence:<br><br>No, this isn't an amendment to the rules. It's a specific answer to a specific problem raised by someone.<br><br>I occasionally use the method myself for one or two items at most, but most of the time I don't find it necessary. If it becomes a rival list then it's definitely not right.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Mark, for clarifying that.</div>

<div class="content"><<If it works for you and is not a problem, then that's fine. But it obviously is a problem for Carol - so my suggestions are directed specifically at helping her with that problem.>><br><br>My post was actually aimed at the problem Carol faces. But a very different approach to yours - and very different to the one she has taken so far.<br><br>Your suggestions would help her keep on the list even when she has a lot of urgent items, and help evaluate the real degree of urgency. Mine says that gaps may be normal and you can just carry on from where you leave off - there's no need to start again as Carol does now and no need to try and make sure that everything is in the list. Of course, if all the tasks on her first list are done or no longer relevant by the time she returns, then she might as well start again and AF with gaps does not help her.<br><br>Part of the issue is whether you feel that you have to keep on the list all the time. If you do feel that but don't manage to keep on it, you then feel guilty and feel you have failed and set about trying again. If you don't feel you have to then its no big deal one way or the other.<br><br>With systems like GTD, it's very difficult to have a gap without then also having to spend time doing a review and starting at the top again. One of the great things about AF, for me at least, is that there's no need to do that - you can just carry on as normal.</div>

<div class="content">Like Dm I think gaps are normal and have found it unnecessary to restart a new AF notebook each time.  My Tuesdays throughThursdays are super structured with meetings and classes and I often don't look at my AF notebook during those days to identify tasks - I know precisely what I need to do (read for wednesday's class, go to class, etc) and I don't have time for much else.  That said, I'm not completely ignoring my AF ntoebook because I'm still writing items at the end of my AF list.  Its just that I'm not cycling through the pages.  <br><br>I've found that its really easy to pick back up on Thursday afternoon with where I was in the AF notebook (I have a yellow sticky marking the active page and a pink sticky marking the final page) and begin cycling through again.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Carol, I have had similar problems - in my case switching several times between DIT and AF. In my view there are advantages and disadvantages to both Systems. I am on my longest spell of AF now (at just over 2 weeks! So not that long at all). <br><br>I have found it helpful to change my attitude towards deadlines - i.e. I will decide when tasks will be done rather than someone else pushing me into it; analysing where I went wrong on my last run of AF and putting that right (last time I kicked off to many jobs at once and got seriously overwhelmed); I've also found it helpful to focus on the simplicity of AF in that (for me at least) it seems to do away with a previous need for projects lists and annual goal lists etc. I am finding that many urgent tasks can be screened and dealt with when working on voicemail / emails / paper inbox which I tend to do at least once a day anyway.<br><br>I've also decided to comit to using AF for a 3 months before switching Systems again.</div>

<div class="content">I have this problem, too (seems pretty common).  When I come back to the list after a few days, I first do a brain clear onto the list.  This is basically writing down everything I have on my mind.  THEN I start back where I was.  I know that duplicate items don't break the system, and it helps me to have that fresh-start feeling.  It also helps me to be secure that I am not missing anything.  Then I work through the list and often find there is lots that has been worked on.  So I cross those off and move them to the end of the list to make sure the other tasks on those pages get worked on as well.</div>
