<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2021-08-1 8:24</div>
<div class="content">I've been reading Donald Reinertsen's book, Principles of Product Development Flow. What a treasure trove of information on the theory and practice of managing queues of work! He discusses queueing theory, batch sizing, variability (both exploiting good variability and reducing bad variability), economic decision-making, cost of delay, handling uncertainty, controlling WIP, and using feedback loops.<br><br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Principles-Product-Development-Flow-Generation-ebook/dp/B00K7OWG7O" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Principles-Product-Development-Flow-Generation-ebook/dp/B00K7OWG7O</a><br><br>I started thinking how to apply his principles to time management systems such as AF1. There are an incredible number of valuable insights -- demonstrating on one hand the brilliance of Mark's systems and how they optimize flow in so many ways -- and on the other hand providing new insights into the dynamics of what causes the systems to break down. <br><br>Here is one of the most powerful insights I've found so far -- it is deceptively simple. It is based on the idea of achieving optimum flow of traffic on a highway. In short: there actually is an optimum number of vehicles to be on the highway. In AF1 terms: there actually is an optimum number of tasks to have on your list.<br><br>The idea is to count how many vehicles per hour are passing along the highway. This is the basic measure of flow. (Flow and throughput are equivalent here.)<br><br>Imagine what would happen if there is only one vehicle zooming down the highway, and not another vehicle anywhere in sight. The speed of the vehicle will be very high, but the overall throughput of vehicles per hour will be very low (one). <br><br>Then add another vehicle. The average vehicle speed is still very high -- though probably a tiny bit slower, as the drivers want to ensure they don't collide. The throughput goes up, but is still low.<br><br>Then keep adding more and more vehicles. As you add vehicles, the average speed decreases, but the throughput continues to increase -- at least for a while.<br><br>Eventually, as you keep adding more vehicles, the average speed continues to decrease, but in addition, you start to develop congestion. At this point, the throughput starts to peak, and then to decrease. If you keep adding more and more vehicles, the congestion gets worse and worse, till the throughput drops very low again. <br><br>This shows that there is an optimum peak level -- in terms of the number of vehicles on the highway -- at which throughput is maximized.<br><br>Adding vehicles always reduces the average speed per vehicle. <br><br>But if the number of vehicles is below the level that gives optimum throughput, adding vehicles will increase throughput. And if the number of vehicles is above the level that gives optimum throughput, *reducing* vehicles increases throughput.<br><br>Also, the dynamics of the situation on each side of that optimum level are very different. <br><br>If you are on the side where there are a few too many vehicles, you can very quickly get into a situation called "Congestive Collapse". As you add more vehicles, you create a negative feedback loop, where your drop in throughput leaves a lot of vehicles on the road while the new incoming vehicles continue to arrive. The number of vehicles increases, multiplying the effect even further -- and you suddenly have a nasty traffic jam. <br><br>But if you are on the other side of the optimum level, where there are too few vehicles, and then you add more vehicles, the throughput actually increases. This situation is much more stable.<br><br><br>Translating all this into terms of tasks:  each vehicle is like a task, driving towards completion. The highway is your list, and each vehicle represents a task. The throughput is the average number of tasks completed every day. The vehicle density is the number of tasks on the list. <br><br>The same flow principles that apply to the vehicles on the highway also apply to the tasks on your list. This means there is an optimum average number of tasks to have on your list at which your daily throughput will be maximized. It will depend on your average number of incoming and outgoing tasks, your average completion rate, etc. But there is an *actual optimum number*.<br><br>To me, that insight alone was worth going through this thought exercise. But it gets better. It's actually quite easy to tell if you are above the optimum number of tasks, or below, and quite simple to take corrective action. If you measure your daily throughput (number of tasks completed each day) and your daily total list size (how many active tasks are on the list at the end of the day), and compare these measurements to the previous day, you can easily determine what side of the optimum you are on:<br><br>Tasks completed per day is UP, and total tasks on the list is DOWN: You are in unstable territory, but moving in the right direction. Keep going like this and you will soon reach optimum throughput.<br><br>Tasks completed per day is UP, and total tasks on the list is UP: You are in stable territory, and moving toward higher throughput, so you might be feeling on top of the world. But be careful, if you keep adding tasks, you may not be able to keep up your completion rate, and you can cross over into unstable territory and face congestive collapse very quickly.<br><br>Tasks completed per day is DOWN, and total tasks on the list is DOWN: You are in stable territory, and your throughput is dropping, but don't worry about it. You are moving into even more stable territory, with lower WIP, and this will naturally increase your flow.<br><br>Tasks completed per day is DOWN, and total tasks on the list is UP: DANGER -- you are in unstable territory and moving deeper into chaos. Congestive collapse is imminent (if you aren't seeing it already). To fix the situation, you can dismiss your oldest pages to bring down the number of total tasks below where it was yesterday.<br><br>It's that final dismissal rule that can keep you at the optimum level of tasks at all times. I am going to give it a try tomorrow -- basically just follow AF1 as usual, with this additional end-of-day dismissal rule. I am guessing it will have the effect of activating the official dismissal rule more often. It should also make the whole system a lot more sustainable, since it should keep it at the most optimal size for maximum throughput. But I am guessing this approach might fail if the forced dismissal is too violent or disruptive. <br><br>Side Note: It's interesting that Mark usually reports these very same metrics (tasks completed per day, and tasks remaining on the list each day) when he is doing his experiments.<br><br><br>There's an interesting article that includes the chart from Reinertsen's book showing the relationship between vehicle density, speed, and throughput. Reinertsen's chart is very confusing -- the units and axes are all wonky -- but if you only look at the actual curves in the chart, and ignore the axes, it should make sense. The article spends a paragraph complaining about "this Hindenburg of charts", and then goes on to explain the concepts very clearly.<br><br><a href="http://blog.danslimmon.com/2015/06/05/kanban-highway-the-least-popular-mario-kart-course/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://blog.danslimmon.com/2015/06/05/kanban-highway-the-least-popular-mario-kart-course/</a></div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br>As I remember being taught during an Army Instructor's Course back in the 60s, "nothing is obvious until it's been explained". I think that applies to the insight you're describing. Once it's been explained it seems so obvious that you wonder how you failed to spot it before.<br><br>It gives a very easy method of working out when you should start dismissing tasks on your list. In fact when you've worked out what the optimal number of tasks is you could keep your list at it by simply having a rule that every time you add a new task you have to delete an old task. In which case you won't need the old dismissal rules at all.<br><br>As far as I can judge at first sight, this rule would work for any "long list" system. I want to try it out, but it'll have to wait till tomorrow as I am at an event most of the day today.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br>One thing which will be interesting to find out is how much the number of tasks on the list affects the throughput. A time management list doesn't have limited physical space available in the way that a road does. To take an extreme example one could do 50 tasks a day with only 50 tasks on the list, but still be able to maintain the rate of 50 tasks a day with 5,000 tasks on the list.<br><br>So I expect the effect on throughput of too many tasks will be more psychological than material - that familiar feeling of being oppressed by the size of the work still to be done.<br><br>How is that going to work out? I have no idea at present. But I suspect a better metric would be how long on average individual tasks remain on the list.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br>Let me run this one past you. <br><br>I've taken the stats at <a href="../blog/FVP Statistics.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2015/6/5/fvp-statistics.html</a> <br><br>Assuming that the period was exactly seven days the solution for Occupancy/Average Processing Rate is 65 / 53.7 = 1.2. <br><br>So it takes 1.2 days to process 65 tasks on average.<br><br>If we took the desired average wait time as 1 day, then the optimal number of tasks on the list would be 54.<br><br>The number of tasks could be maintained at 54 tasks by the means I have just outlined, i.e. every time a new task is added another task must be removed. To make that even easier the task to be removed could be the first live task on the list.<br><br>Re-entered tasks of course do not affect the overall total, so you could re-enter as much as you liked without having to delete any tasks.<br><br>This is based on NQ-FVP. Other systems may differ, but I wouldn't imagine by much for the same user. I would expect that 54 tasks would remain optimal for me whether I was using Simple Scanning, AF 1 or any other long-list system.</div>

<div class="content">This is interesting.  I am writing my tasks in a notebook right now.  I would think that it would only be practical to keep track of the number of tasks if this were done electronically on computer; one could have a file/folder of the tasks done today, and the program would display a total of the number of lines/tasks.  It does not seem very practical though if it is analog, as the number would keep on changing, and it would take too long to count.  (Am I missing something?)  I am not clear whether the total number of tasks on the list include these tasks done today or not.  Or once these are done, they are not counted? So the tasks that are counted are those that are not started, or not finished?  Also, is the word "tasks" being used in distinction from "projects"?</div>

The Reinertsen book is full of obvious things like that. :)<br><br><br><< In fact when you've worked out what the optimal number of tasks is you could keep your list at it by simply having a rule that every time you add a new task you have to delete an old task.

I started with AF1 since that is the one I've been using most recently, and probably the one that's familiar to the widest audience here. But Paul MacNeal's post on the Random method got me wondering how it might apply there.<br><br><br><< I expect the effect on throughput of too many tasks will be more psychological than material - that familiar feeling of being oppressed by the size of the work still to be done. >><br><br>Yes, I believe you are correct. The thing to watch is how the numbers change from one day to the next. The combination of increase/decrease in total tasks versus increase/decrease in tasks completed per day tells you which side of the throughput peak you are at -- on the dangerous side (prone to congestive collapse) or the stable side (where the flow tends to be self-correcting).<br><br>Basically if total tasks and number of completed tasks increase or decrease in tandem, then you are stable. But if one is increasing and one is decreasing, it is unstable, and if it's the total tasks increasing with completion rate decreasing, that's the real dangerous situation.<br><br><br><< But I suspect a better metric would be how long on average individual tasks remain on the list. >> <br><br>Interesting you should mention that. Reinertsen often refers to Little's Law, which demonstrates a simple, robust relationship between these three:<br><br>Lambda = average completion rate (tasks per day)<br>L = average number of tasks in the system <br>W = average wait time (average time each task has been in the system)<br><br>The relationship is simple:  W = L / Lambda<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little%27s_law" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little%27s_law</a><br><br><br>This relates to increasing and decreasing completion rate (Lambda) and task count (L) as follows:<br><br>-- If L and Lambda are both increasing or both decreasing, you'd expect W to be about the same.<br><br>-- If L is up and Lambda is down, then W will go sharply up. This is a sign of Congestive Collapse.<br><br>-- If L is down and Lambda is up, then W will go sharply down.<br><br><br>It's almost always good to reduce W. It always means you are moving away from the Congestive Collapse zone and towards the stability zone. It means throughput is improving faster than the list is growing. Either your list is shrinking (which provides more focus and less scanning overhead), or your throughput is improving (meaning you have found a way to be more efficient). <br><br>(I say "almost always good" and not "always good", because you can also reduce wait time significantly by only having 1 or 2 tasks on your list. This can work just fine (cf. No List) but is probably not what we want for a long-list system, where we expect the list to also do incubation and sorting.)<br><br>On the other hand, if W is increasing, you could apply the same new dismissal rule -- dismiss a number of old pages so that W is flat or down.</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br><< it takes 1.2 days to process 65 tasks on average. >><br><br>This can be useful information, but it actually doesn't tell you about where you are at on the congestion curve, or whether you are moving towards peak throughput or away from it.

Maybe that's good, maybe not -- depends on whether you are looking for more throughput or more focus, I suppose.<br><br><br><< The number of tasks could be maintained at 54 tasks by the means I have just outlined, i.e. every time a new task is added another task must be removed.

For me, both new task generation and task completion come in bursts, and represent a different mindset and stage in my workday. I think it could be disruptive to try to manage the task count right in the middle of a brainstorm where I am adding a bunch of new tasks. <br><br>Reinertsen actually discusses a similar concept in his section on "The Principle of Periodic Resynchronization", and gives the example of busses in a bus line. If busses simply work their way through their route, you will inevitably have busses bunching up into pairs -- the front bus picks up and drops off the most people, and the rear bus deals with any extras. And thus the front bus goes slower and slower, and the rear bus goes faster and faster -- with the result that they arrive in pairs. To prevent this, you need to recalibrate the departure times, so that at least at critical junctures, the bus does not leave before the appointed time. You could do this recalibration at every bus stop (which is like your approach of adding a new task only when you eliminate an old task) or recalibration only at critical junctures (which is like my approach of rebalancing once a day). It's really an economic decision which way would work better, and will be different for different bus lines (or long list users). :)</div>

It's the buses' passengers which are causing the bunching.

So to give an example, if you have a 54 task list, which you regard as optimal, and you add 20 new tasks during the day, you are working with a 74 task list. Then at the end of the day you have to get into "Delete" mindset and spend quite a bit of time deleting tasks. And all the while you've been working with a sub-optimal list.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br>Btw do you have average speed cameras in the States?<br><br>In the UK they are becoming increasingly common, especially for road works on major roads.<br><br>For road works the speed limit is usually 50 mph.

<div class="content">I have many divergent thoughts on this topic.  One, the comparison of cars to tasks is flawed, not completely so, but slightly, in that cars represent parallel actions and task execution by an individual is sequential.  It would be more like operating a toy highway system where the child moves each car one by one.  In that context it becomes clear that the most efficient way to move cars is to move individual cars a great distance, and to reduce the amount of time spent switching cars. <br><br>I also feel that while counting active tasks is accurate, counting task activations is not an accurate measure of progress.  Filing a tax return for example.  If you do that in 15 separate sessions, you will have produced as much [with respect to this task] as your neighbor who did it all in one go. So the question is not how much a task is activated, but how many tasks are carried through to completion over time.  This is affected by the Speed of work, and Delay between tasks.  It’s also affected by how much time you spend [e.g.] watching Youtube, which while you might count it as a task, really doesn’t help get the taxes done nor anything else.<br><br>There is also a question of Elapsed time for an individual task.  Some tasks are better done quickly because the positive outcome only begins when the task is done.  <br><br>So it is often better to keep a list of tasks short, so the time taken to find the next task will be short, so your familiarity with working the task is high and you can operate efficiently, so you execute the task frequently and get it to completion fast.  (And incidentally get it off the list, keeping it short, notwithstanding if they generate a multitude of additional tasks on completion.)</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br><< Btw do you have average speed cameras in the States? >><br><br>We had these several years ago in central Phoenix, and yes, they had a remarkable impact on improving the flow of traffic. Unfortunately, most of these traffic camera systems are tied in one way or another to state or municipal revenue. As a result, state legislators and city councilmembers can't resist optimizing the systems to increase revenue, even at the expense of public safety. For example, introducing a very visible but still unexpected reduction in the speed limit somewhere along the camera-controlled route; or reducing the yellow-light timing specifically to generate more tickets, even though this increases rear-end collisions and drivers speeding through intersections. Ridiculous but true.<br><br>All the traffic camera manufacturers receive revenue kickbacks from the local government authorities -- sometimes legally (it's a key element of their business model), sometimes illegally. Many former executives from these companies have done time in prison as a result. For example: <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/story/money/business/2016/10/20/ex-redflex-traffic-camera-ceo-karen-finley-sentenced-prison-bribery/92459320/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.azcentral.com/story/money/business/2016/10/20/ex-redflex-traffic-camera-ceo-karen-finley-sentenced-prison-bribery/92459320/</a><br><br>As a result, the traffic camera systems have been challenged again and again in courts across the US, and many states have banned their use altogether. <br><br>Maybe cadence-based methods, such as Agile sprints, or the Pomodoro technique, could be regarded as methods to keep the work moving at a consistent pace. Reinertsen describes many cadence-based principles for improving the flow of work -- such as the Agile practice of Daily Standup Meetings to reduce disruptive ad-hoc meetings throughout the week -- or monthly project review meetings instead of trying to schedule (and re-schedule) project review meetings at major milestones -- and shows how they improve flow. None of these is exactly like the speed-regulating cameras but they do seem to be tapping into the same underlying principle.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Seraphim:<br><br>Thanks for this interesting discussion. I recently tried out FVP, then AF1, then Volantas' KeepFocus for trials of 3 weeks each (though I ended AF1 after 2 weeks after it was clear I was not sticking to the algorithm). Amusingly my average tasks actioned per day rounded to 21 tasks for each method, so I guess my throughput is method-independent? I would recommend KeepFocus for having the least "list processing" time though.<br><br>I didn't keep daily stats on "number of active tasks remaining in the list". Definitely list length slowed me down, which KF solved by severely restricting what went on the Active list.<br><br>How are you counting actioned but not completed tasks for throughput purposes? Many of my tasks are related to projects which can take weeks/months (e.g. read this book, finish this course) so to gain some sense of accomplishment I keep track of each time I "action" it. With this highway/Kanban mindset it does seem wrong to count trucks still "on the highway" towards throughput. I could formally divide them into tasks (e.g. read chapter 1) and not count each individual task until its done, but not all projects divide so easily.</div>

You may also do better in the long run than the neighbour you mention, who makes a lot of mistakes as a result of doing it in one huge session. Both of these may end up being penalized.

<div class="content">Virix:<br><br><< How are you counting actioned but not completed tasks for throughput purposes? >><br><br>With most of Mark's long-list systems, these tasks would be crossed-out and re-entered. Each crossed-out task adds to the throughput count, whereas the total WIP count stays flat.<br><br>Since one's "little and often" habits are probably similar from one day to the next, and you can only analyze the Congestive Collapse curve by comparing one day to the next, I am guessing it would not create any real distortions.</div>

<div class="content">Alan Baljeu:<br><br><< cars represent parallel actions and task execution by an individual is sequential >><br><br>The original post isn't about the analogy between vehicles and tasks.

But if you spend hour after hour watching Youtube while the unattended WIP continues to grow, well, that's exactly what Congestive Collapse is describing!  Throughput is down, WIP is up, and the proximate cause appears to be the long Youtube sessions. I guess my new dismissal rule won't help that problem much, except to make visible that lots of valuable tasks are getting dismissed for the sake of Youtube.</div>
