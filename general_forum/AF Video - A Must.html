<div class="content">+1 for this idea. A YouTube video showing the process in action should make this much clearer for those, like myself who just don't totally grok the "scan through list on multiple pages" gig.</div>

<div class="content">I had a video made for YouTube several weeks ago. Unfortunately the person who made it has been having extreme trouble with the camera she took it on. Hopefully it won't be too long now.<br><br>To clarify the "next page" stuff:<br><br>You have a long list of tasks in a notebook. The list may cover a number of pages.<br><br>You start with page 1 and look at each task in turn until you come to a task you feel like doing. Do it.<br><br>Then continue down the page, doing any further tasks you feel like doing.<br><br>When you reach the bottom of the page, start again at the top of the page.<br><br>Continue doing this on the same page until you go from top to bottom of the page without doing any more tasks.<br><br>Then move on to Page 2. Do exactly the same.<br><br>When you've got to the end of the list, start again with the first page.<br><br>Now read the full instructions again!</div>
