<div class="content">Registration on Mark Forster's forum takes time from him and users, which is why i thought OpenID a good solution. OpenID is a recent technology that allows you to have one login and to log in to every site that supports OpenID. For example you have an OpenID provider, say, Livejournal account, you enter username.livejournal.com, your password and you are logged in.<br><br>I don't know, how it is possible to implement OpenID on this site, but if it is possible, it would be great. Everyone, who has an OpenID (that includes everyone, who has Google, Yahoo, Livejournal, Wordpress.com, Livejournal accounts), could easily login without registration, and if somebody doesn't, there are plenty of OpenID providers.<br><br>You can find more about it here:<br><a href="http://openid.net/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://openid.net/</a><br><br>The list of OpenID providers can be found here:<br><a href="http://openid.net/get-an-openid/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://openid.net/get-an-openid/</a><br><br>P.S. No, this is not spam, i really love Autofocus, and this post is a wish to improve this forum. :)</div>

<div class="content">@sindikat:<br><br>This website is run by squarespace, and my guess would be it doesn't support OpenID (based on past feature requests which all were not supported, too). Anyways, Mark chose the manual registration process to filter out spammers, and implementing an open and automatable login system would basically throw the forum back to its previous state.<br><br>@Alan:<br><br>Yes, spammers can easily create OpenIDs, everyone can. You can use one of the services sindikat mentioned or even install you own if you want. I have my own OpenID server running on my website, and it was as easy as installing a simple php script.<br><br>So a spammer could create an OpenID, spam away at the forum, and when Mark bans his OpenID, he could create another one in seconds.<br><br>That's not to say OpenID is a bad idea in itself, it just doesn't solve this forum's problem. Using OpenID for login could work, but only in conjunction with either an automatic spam filtering mechanism and/or a moderation team. And managing all of that is probably more trouble for Mark than manually creating accounts now and then.</div>

<div class="content">As far as I'm concerned it's working just fine at present. I'm getting one or two requests a day for accounts which I can easily deal with.</div>
