<div class="content">Hi Mike<br><br>As you obviously have a lot of experience with software glitches and clearly love Vista and it's intuitive realtionship with Office :-) , I wondered if you had any solution to the immensely annoying habit of Outlook to suddenly start staying on top when you change focus to another window (or at least attempt to!)<br><br>Apart from manually minimising it can be corrected by cleaning the Outlook profile (or by rebooting), but eventually recurrs and I have no idea what causes it in the first place. Do you have any ideas?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine,<br><br>Yeah, this is just one example of a wider problem.  Windows does not seem to handle focus very well, in general.  One thing that seems to cause Outlook in particular to steal focus is AutoSync ... and that makes some sense as they interact.  But many other things do it as well.<br><br>Under Windows XP, there was a program called TweakUI and you could use it to tell Windows to not allow focus to be stolen.  Under Vista, however, the corresponding program, TweakVI, does not seem to have that option.<br><br>Focus stealing is one of the really crazy making "features" of windows.  It is especially bad for touch typists who are rolling along when a dialog box steals focus and you randomly respond to a critical question and do not even know what it was!  Arrrrg.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike<br><br>Thanks for that - hope you didn't mind me asking :-)  I suspect if I shut my PC down more frequently it wouldn't be a problem - resetting the profile through the command prompt isn't exactly intuitive!  And why is it that every so often it refuses to open Word - crashes with an unknown problem, and requires a reboot to reset.  Aaaaagh indeed!  (Thinking out loud - is there a cmd to reset Word without a reboot?)  <br><br>And don't you just love it when a program crashes, reports the program that caused the crash and then sweetly informs you that the program was manufactured by Microsoft!<br><br>I think we should start a Microsoft appreciation society.<br><br>Thanks again Mike</div>

<div class="content">Hey Christine,<br><br>I'm not sure what you mean by "reset" Word.  I know that when you exit some programs, Word is one of them, it leaves some fragment running ... probably so it can restart more quickly next time (more Microsoft mind reading).  One thing that may help is to start the task manager (right click on the bottom line in windows or do CTL-ALT-DEL and select "task manager") then find the Word process (it won't be a task, I think it might be "winword") and "end process".  You'll get a dire warning, but once it is ended, things might be cleaner.<br><br>Just a thought.  And I do love those messages that tell you Windows will give you more information and then does not, or gives you some useless bit of information like "your task crashed".  OY!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike<br><br>I was thinking of something along the lines of the cleanprofile command for Outlook.  I'll certainly try the winword option next time it does that to me.  I never get much time to investigate all of the foibles of windows these days - mind you, my new Autofocused mind should be able to make the time ........ :-)<br><br>The advantage of having had my own business meant that I had to learn as much as possible about PC's so that I did not have to employ someone each time it went wrong (actually that was an excuse - I just love gadgets so it wasn't exactly a hardship!)  I really feel for people who have no computer knowledge because nothing is straightforward anymore.  And whoever decided that computers were logical - well!  If they are I've always owned the intuitive ones!<br><br>Thanks again Mike!</div>

<div class="content">Sorry to interrupt your conversation, but in favor of XP users who come across this thread and are hoping to fix this HUGE annoyance ("focus stealing") with Tweak UI I'd like to add that from my experience, this option does exist, but doesn't work correctly. Maybe that's why it has been left out of the new version for Vista. <br><br>I can't remember if it ever worked correctly on XP (as it did on Windows 2000, where I used it for years), but hasn't worked right for me at least since I installed IE 7. Several applications still steal focus, and the taskbar "flashing" doesn't happen.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Alex,<br><br>One of the really crazy making things about all of this is that you'll meet as many users for whom TweakUI works, as those for whom it does not.  This stuff seems so completely arbitrary at times.  Undoubtedly a function of almost infinite (and mostly unnecessary) complexity.  And yes, I have seen lots of complaints pinning the problem to IE7.  But I can tell you that switching to FireFox, while it may prevent problems caused by IE7, does not fix all of the problems.   That is because the basic problem is that Windows itself should be the one to control the focus at all times ... but it obviously has wandered off into la-la land.</div>

<div class="content">Christine,<br><br>A parable (but true, and sadly so).  In my misspent youth I took my turn in the barrel chairing an operating system problem reporting committee.  The way this thing worked is that users would report problems and they would be investigated and the fix would be discussed among everyone responsible for the upcoming release and marketing (who's livelihood depended on the system working correctly for the end users).<br><br>One day a problem reached the committee regarding a user complaint that a particular database product, when you asked for a report on some field, sorted hundreds of blank lines to the top of the report (for those entries where that field was blank).  After much debate the database programmer exclaimed in frustration: "It works as coded."  There was not a closed mouth in the room!<br><br>For years that idiotic (but perfectly understandable) response helped me make sense of the nonsense in the industry.  "Works as coded."  Of course, everything always works as coded ... the problem is why was it coded that way!!!!<br><br>Yes, transistors are logical.  Integrated circuits are logical.  The entire hardware box is logical.  Even the software is logical, from the standpoint that it works as coded.  But why do idiots code things that way?  I could write a book about that.  But why bother?  Others have already done so.<br><br>I wish I could remember the title of a book I read a few decades ago about this exact problem .  The author cited the case of a crashed school bus where the driver was blamed.  She denied it.  After much investigation it was determined that she DID shift into low gear on the downside of a hill (as safety and the law require), and as unbelievable as it sounded, her story about the bus shifting out of gear on its own WAS true.  The manufacturer had decided that to protect the engine from over reving and being damaged he would design the transmission to shift into neutral in that condition ... yet that condition was one which drivers (and highway officials) counted on to save lives ... not engines.<br><br>And the beat goes on.</div>

<div class="content">Mike, I had to smile at your story.  Reminds me of a similar one where I was brought into a company to work on an archive database.  It didn't take long to realise that major changes were required because the program was not what was needed.  Of course it worked "as coded" *and* as the programmer had been instructed.  At that time, whilst I certainly could not have written the program myself, I was fortunately able to read the code to an extent that I could work with the programmer to identify the specific areas needing change. However, nowadays, I don't think anyone has any idea where to look in half the code written because it is such a mish-mash of add-ons to old code, fixes & repairs, and probably the remnants of someone's sock draw, to make any sense whatsoever.<br><br>When I first had Vista, I upgraded a program I used regularly to the Vista version, to find very quickly that my files "disappeared".  (You can probably tell where I'm going with this .........) The programs' built in Explorer showed the file,  Windows Explorer didn't. The software company assured me I was looking in the wrong place.  I assured them I wasn't.    They asked for screen prints which I provided. They went quiet!  Very quiet. For days. So ........  I went on a hunt for my file and found it lurking happily in, of course, Vista's Virtual Store.  At that point I learned all about the Virtual Store, presented the software company with my findings so that they had all they needed to make their program Vista compliant :-), and went sadly on my way ............... ho hum .....  <br><br>I have now come to the sad but true conclusion that the best response to software is to be found in the immortal words of AA Milne - "Bother, said Pooh crossly.........."</div>

<div class="content">Re: Sock drawer.<br><br>The problem inherently (and inescapably) bound into the whole idea of bug fixes is that the changes are not reflected back to the requirements document.  Most often the bug starts out with the requirements ... someone had not conceived of a situation so it was not addressed.  If you don't go all the way back and then clean the mess up through each stage of the development process you'll never get it right.  Something will always be working at odds with something else.<br><br>Another of my favorite examples:  While working at the same company as before I was debugging an operating system crash for a computer in Spain.  It happened that as soon as a log tape was first mounted the system crashed ... we spent weeks tracking it down.  The solution was as funny as it was tragic and costly.  It seems that when the OS was first modified to work in Australia there was a need to use both seven track log tapes and change the way the date was formatted (differently from the U.S.).  Some brain trust decided that there was only one spare bit he could use so he used that one bit for both things (in a crucial OS data structure).  This goofball even called it the "Australian Bit", in the OS documentation ... which, of course, compounded the problem as it did not immediately indicate that it had anything to do with log tapes or time!<br><br>When the OS was used for Spain, there was a need for the same date format (I think, it is getting fuzzy now, or it may have been for the same log tapes) in any case, they tested that flag and since the other feature was tied to it (but not wanted) the whole house of cards came down.  I mean, hey, you have a spare bit lying around doing nothing, why not use it?  What could possibly go wrong?  Arrrrg.<br><br>All of this comes down to good practice and religious adherence to logic and documentation.  ALL of which are in short supply in the computer industry.</div>

<div class="content">I have heard of something similar somewhere in my dim and distant past, or perhaps I'm just thinking back to good old Y2K!<br><br>You are absolutely right when you say "Most often the bug starts out with the requirements ... someone had not conceived of a situation so it was not addressed."  That is just so true.  I recall sitting on inter-departmental systems working parties where every department was only concerned about their individual needs and invariably knew little about computers - trying to reach a consensus was hard enough let alone find one that would work.  The archive database I was working with used a file reference for retrieval - good idea you would think.  Unfortunately no one had picked up on the fact that, due to corporate amalgamations the reference number used was not unique.  Up to six companies could have used the same sequential referencing series - added to which there was total inconsistency in the way the reference was recorded.  It took almost as long to ensure a consistent input and recording format, and to add a distinguishing identifier, as to log all of the files (and there were many - a bus garage full in fact...........).  It never ceases to amaze me that what seems to be so obvious is not identified in the planning stage ....... <br><br>Anyway, I guess we could swap stories 'til the cows come home ....... good job I marked it as a non-AF post :-)</div>

<div class="content">Sorry for yet another interuption,, but I'd like to put one thing straight: <br><br>It wasn't *using* IE7 that caused the problem for me, but *installing* it (AFAIR). <br><br>Actually, I use IE7 rarely. And one of the worst offenders is, in fact, Opera. <br><br>So to me, it looks like a problem caused by changes to the underlying operating system when you install IE7.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>ROTF ;-)  That is one of those things which really should tell you the depth of the problem.  The basic thinking is just not there and that tiny bit of trivial nonsense is how you see the shark's fin above the water.  Like the "Australian bit" I mentoned, no one thought about what they were really doing.  "Start" should really be "Menu", for example.  But with typical mind reading they suppose everyone has to be led by the nose to the place they should "start" ... but I have to wonder why they did not think the "desktop" should be called "start" as well ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Christine,<br><br>And that wonderful behavior ... "shutdown" = "shutdown but first install updates"! !!!!!  <br><br>What if you have automatic updates enabled (as MS insists you should) and updates have automatically installed without your notice (remember the focus problems where things pop-up and vanish?).  You look up when you hear your flight announced and scramble to close up your laptop to get on the plane.  You shut it down but are confronted with a screen telling you to not turn off the computer while updates are installed ("phase one of three") or the world will end ... while the plane is boarding!  <br><br>OMG, how do they think up these things?  Oh, wait, they don't think!  ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Alex<br><br>Please don't feel this is an *exclusive* thread - it's nice to have an IT rant space!  <br><br>I'm not an expert on computers but IE7 (and other versions) are certainly a lot more intrusive than is realised.  I made the serious mistake of trying the Beta version of IE8.  It has some nice features but kept crashing so I naturally tried to uninstall.  You can't!  There is no way whatsoever (and apparently this was true of the IE7 Beta also). Nothing will remove it and allow you to go back.  Rollback does not even do it.  I finally decided to uninstall completely and reinstall - disaster!  It deleted material files and I was left with a totally blank screen apart from the wallpaper.  No icons, no start bar, absoluteley nothing!  The only thing that worked was Task Manager but what do you do with TM when you have nothing to work with?  <br><br>Fortunately TM has a built in explorer. I was also fortunate in that I had another computer and was able to obtain the necessary files, copy them to CD, and reinstall using explorer in Task Manager and the CD Drive.<br><br>There is no way any software manufacturer should be allowed to produce such a program scenario - in other circumstances it would be billed as a virus!  Certainly the cure was not something that anyone without a reasonable amount of computer knowledge would have had any hope of resolving ....................</div>

<div class="content">Mark, <br><br>I always found that "Start" button stupid, as well. In fact, there are even instructions on the internet how to change the letters on this button (just google for "Start Button" and "Resource Hacker"). It's pretty technical, though, and not all of the instructions are completely correct.<br><br>Years ago, I did this using a hex editor on a copy of explorer.exe (didn't know about Resource Hacker back then) and, since I couldn't come up with a meaningful name, deleted all the letters and made a mini-button out of it. Unfortunately, my modified version of explorer.exe got replaced by several updates.<br><br>I doubt that doing this counts as a good use of your time - could make a nice "fun" item on an AF list, though. :-)<br><br>-- <br>Alex</div>
