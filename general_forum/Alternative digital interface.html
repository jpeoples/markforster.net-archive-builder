<div class="content">Hello everyone,<br><br>I recently had the idea that you don't really need a list at all for using autofocus - at least not a traditional list which shows several items at once. <br><br>The autofocus instructions tell us to always concentrate on one task and one task alone, make a decision about it, then consider the next task. An  interface that shows only the current task would bear less risk of not following the autofocus process by aimlessly scanning the whole page. <br><br>So I thought about implementing autofocus with index cards, a index card corresponds not to a page, but to a single task, and a page is a deck of cards, and the whole "list" consists of several decks. That approach is a little bulky in paper form, but digitally I think it could really shine.<br><br>I created a little demo here: <a href="http://wiki.autofocus.cc/dojo/" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.autofocus.cc/dojo/</a><br><br>It contains five dummy task cards. If you click "Next Task", you shuffle through the deck. If you leave the last card, you get back to the first. If you click "Mark as done", the card get's removed from the deck.<br><br>What do you think of this approach?<br><br>I think it would enable a far more accurate implementation of the autofocus process, you could have a skimming face at the beginning, where you can't do anything but shuffle through the deck. After you are through, you go to the first "doing" pass. There you get asked for each card "Do you feel like working on this?" if you answer yes, you work on it and can then choose if you're finished or want to readd. If you shuffle through a deck without doing anything, you automatically get to the next deck. If it was your first pass, the current deck gets automatically dismissed.</div>

<div class="content">Argh, it's supposed to be "skimming phase", not "skimming face"! Where did that come from? :-)</div>

<div class="content">I think this indeed emphasizes the original Autofocus process. I like it!<br><br>I've wondered how to emulate this with my own setup. One of the things that appeals to me is the possibility of enhancing the way the task is presented. Anywhere from using a nicer, bigger font to actually adding visuals that relate to the goal. Can't tell how big of a difference this would make... But,<br>The digital approach makes experimenting with this much easier! <br><br>You could even add voice transcription and have your tasks voiced out by Sean Connery or an exciting female voice...like Margaret Thatcher <br><br>hmm audiofocus. I can imagine some uses for that!</div>

<div class="content">Nice idea! I will have to find time to play with it, before I can give constructive feedback.</div>

<div class="content">I like the singular focus, except I'm afraid it could really slow down the process of skimming a page/deck. I sometimes assign some of my digital tasks to a short list to work from apart from AF and this approach would make that very slow. <br><br>Just brainstorming, but what if instead of dismissing an entire deck or page, the user could choose never to dismiss or to dismiss individual tasks after a defined number of exposures with no action? Obviously, this approach would not be AF as designed. Another idea which IS in the spirit of AF: Rather than ask the user if s/he feels like working on every task, the program could prompt the user only when a task/deck was about to be dismissed as in, "Are you sure there isn't a small step you are willing to do toward these tasks?" or "Are you sure you do not want to spend just a few minutes on these tasks?"</div>

<div class="content">I think the ability to scan a whole page at a time is part of the essence of AF, so any approach that does not have that is a significant departure.<br><br>OTOH, I can see you could view it as within the spirit of AF if you put the emphasis on considering each item carefully to give it a chance to stand out.</div>

<div class="content">Dm:<br><br>I don't really see being able to see the whole page as (a part of) the essence of autofocus. Perhaps that's because I've always used digital solutions where I had to scroll anyway to see all tasks. When I read Mark's instructions, what stands out to me is <br>looking at one task at a time. But perhaps I'm just misinterpreting something.<br><br>A compromise would be to first skim in list mode and then switch to card mode for doing.<br><br>Mark, if you're reading this, what's your opinion on this?<br><br></div>

<div class="content">I just watched the video again to refresh my memory and clarify the written instructions. And there Mark clearly concentrates on one item at a time, even in the initial skimming phase. He even uses is pen to quickly point at each item in turn to help him focus on it. I don't really see that much of a difference between that and quickly shuffling through a card deck, quickly looking at each card.</div>

<div class="content">The Hit List software will let you view tasks as a liist or as individual "cards." Not sure how you would establish decks/pages...</div>

<div class="content">How about when a task is dismissed, it goes to a "someday/maybe" deck for future consideration.  Then that deck could have a "re add" function to put the tasks at the end of the deck.<br><br>I love your nice animation for tasks marked done ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Very interesting idea andreas. Works great on my iPhone an I can see how it really allow a sense of focused consideration of a task. <br><br>Being able to scan tasks quickly for any urgencies might also be key. I have a relatively short list but if it were very long it might take a while if one were "hunting" for an item somewhere on the list/within the decks <br><br>Regards<br><br>Mark j</div>

<div class="content">Mark j:<br><br>Well, I think this is where the flexibility of a digital approach comes into play. I only intend the "card mode" for working the list. For reviewing and rearranging, a traditional list view is of course better.</div>

<div class="content">Mark J:<br><br>I optimized the example for the iPhone: <a href="http://wiki.autofocus.cc/dojo/iphone.html" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.autofocus.cc/dojo/iphone.html</a><br><br>It should work well with landscape and portrait orientation, and if you add it to your home screen and start it from there, it has true fullscreen. Please tell me what you think.</div>

<div class="content">Andreas - <br><br>quite interesting! I like so much to see a good idea!<br><br>(although I myself prefer the old model of a  list, and never liked the paper index cards .)</div>

<div class="content">Mel:<br><br>I will, I just have my plate full at the moment (thesis deadline on June 30, 2009). Perhaps I'll find the time before July, but don't hold your breath.<br><br>Regards,<br>Andreas</div>
