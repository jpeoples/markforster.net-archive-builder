<div class="content">I've found Prof Jordan Peterson's "philosophy" a helpful context to shaping goals and schedules. His views are summarised at (for example) <a href="http://bit.ly/2WtArgM" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://bit.ly/2WtArgM</a></div>

<div class="content">Another idea if Jordan's that I like, not mentioned here, is how you should change.<br><br>First, you get your self in order.<br>Then, you get your house in order.<br>Then, you get your career in order.<br>Then you contribute to your local community.<br>Then you contribute to society.</div>

<div class="content">I really like Jordan Peterson's videos and books. I'm working my way through 12 Rules for Life - really good stuff. <br><br>Meanwhile, this had me rolling on the floor. :-)<br><br><a href="http://www.facebook.com/Neel.Kolhatkar94/videos/472676383481947/?v=472676383481947" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.facebook.com/Neel.Kolhatkar94/videos/472676383481947/?v=472676383481947</a></div>

<div class="content">I especially liked "create a schedule you like" ie don't make it punitive. Add rewards.</div>

<div class="content">Yes, in general, I like Peterson's approach of facing the situation realistically and practically. He demands that I face up to the mess of my life, but the demand isn't coming from a pathological inner voice that requires impossible perfection.</div>

<div class="content">I found mastering myself and getting my life in order first was a bad choice. I followed Fly Lady's optimistic advice and spent several years focusing on my own stuff instead of the family system. If I couldn't keep to my personal schedule, what right did I have to enforce one on the kids? Once I got my own system going smoothly, the kids would automatically see how wonderfully it worked.<br><br>Waiting until each level is perfect before moving on to the next is a way to procrastinate, and also a symptom of I will be happy when thinking. I will be happy when I lose 20 lbs. I will volunteer when my house is perfectly clean. I will donate money to a good cause when the mortgage is paid off.<br><br>It can also go in the opposite direction. I will make my home an enjoyable and relaxing place to come home to after I solve the world's problems. I will spend time with my kids after I volunteer at the school.</div>

<div class="content">Cricket <br><br><<spent several years focusing on my own stuff instead of the family system.

From that perspective, working on oneself most definitely will impact the family system. The interconnectedness of each member is impacted by each member functioning up or down. <br><br>Kudos to you for the progress.</div>

<div class="content">Yep, working on oneself will impact other family members. It's easier to be healthy if those around you are. I wish, though, that I'd insisted the kids do more about the house. Just because I didn't do the dishes every night when I was the only one doing it (and everything else when they were really young) didn't mean I couldn't assign it as a daily chore once they were old enough.</div>

<div class="content">Somewhat related to Peterson and his "Maps of Meaning", I've recently taken to listening to Jonathan Pageau, whom I think members of this forum in particular would find interesting.  An Orthodox Christian, French Canadian, and an artist focused on traditional iconography.  He talks about the patterns in how the world works and how we interpret things.</div>
