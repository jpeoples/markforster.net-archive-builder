<div class="content">I'm having some trouble with the switch to AF4. With AF2, I can be very specific about things that I have to do at work, knowing that I'll reach them very fast. For example, I can put:<br><br>Work on bug #1234<br>Continue development of report<br>Pay bill<br>Work on bug #1240<br>Fix data errors<br>Call mom<br>et c...<br><br>After fixing a bug, I immediately want to reach the next one. If I find some non-work task in the middle that I can allow myself to work on (like “Pay bill”), I do it.<br><br>With AF1/4 I have to loop through pages/backlog. I know I won't be able to work on most of these tasks now. As I used to do with AF1, I'd have to concentrate all the bugs and work related stuff in a single task, “Work on Billing System”, and keep the detail on a separate system. But this way, I can't apply the benefits of AF to my specific work tasks.<br><br><br>I think that AF1/4 suits people who have a lot of discretionary time.<br>For me, having a couple of bosses, and dozens of anxious users, AF2 seems like better choice. I can't stop working in the middle of the day to water the plants :-)<br>RAF with its two modes had the potential to be the solution I needed, but I could never reach Forward Mode. But this, in some way, reflects my reality.<br><br>I know I can keep using AF2, but knowing that Mark has already replaced it, makes me feel like using an old version of a program (something I never liked).<br><br>I will try AF4 anyway, I might be surprised, but I suspect that it won't be as effective for me.<br></div>

<div class="content"><< I know I can keep using AF2, but knowing that Mark has already replaced it, makes me feel like using an old version of a program (something I never liked). >><br><br>I think that's the wrong way to think about it. If AF2 works great for you, you don't need a "better" version. There are many people who had issues with AF2, which where addressed with RAF. And the issues people had with RAF where addressed with AF4. ;-)<br><br>So unless you have issues with your current setup, don't worry about being "current".<br><br>Old IT wisdom: Never change a running system.<br><br>For example, I never upgraded from XP to Vista. Vista was "newer", but it didn't solve any problem I had with XP, so keeping XP was the logical choice.</div>

<div class="content">Of course, nothing wrong with experimentation, i.e. dual-booting linux beside windows or experimenting with AF4 to see how you like it. But don't feel like you *have* to do it. :-)</div>

<div class="content">AF-XP ?<br><br>I know you're right, Andreas, when talking about software.<br>But I feel that new AF versions are created to deal with flaws from the previous ones.<br><br>Maybe AF should consist on several methods, tailored for different kind of users.<br><br>This could open the possibility for Mark to produce a book. <br>Maybe something like “Choose Your Own Adventure”. In the end, you would have your own personal AF system. :-)<br><br></div>

<div class="content"><< Maybe AF should consist on several methods, tailored for different kind of users. >><br><br>That's the way I see the existing systems. ;-)<br><br>That's the reason we I won't throw away my AutofocusCC which implements AF1 or my AutofocusAHK which implements RAF. I think they both still have their merits for different kinds of users. In the next days, I'll modify AutofocusAHK to let the user choose between AF1, AF2, (R)AF3 and AF4. So everyone can use it the way he thinks is best for him.</div>

<div class="content"><<I know you're right, Andreas, when talking about software.>><br><br>I think the comparison isn't that far fetched. If I would change the OS of my computer, I'd need time to set the new system up, perhaps I couldn't use the same programs as before and had to learn new ways of using the computer. If you change your time management system, you must set the new system up, which takes time. You must get accustomed to the new way things are done in the new system, your experience with the old system may be useless or even hinder you.<br><br><<But I feel that new AF versions are created to deal with flaws from the previous ones. >><br><br>They are. My point is: do those flaws affect you? If you have the feeling something is amiss in your system, then maybe a different version solves that problem. But if you're doing fine with AF2, you're okay.</div>

<div class="content">>> My point is: do those flaws affect you?<br><br>Yes and no: Working on the latest tasks somehow calms my anxiety and user's, but at the same time, I'm neglecting the older stuff. This is one of the things people complained about AF2.<br><br>RAF's intentions fitted me perfectly. A system that lets me to work both ways. But it wasn't strict enough when it was time to make the switch to Forward Mode.<br><br>I could use an improved AF2/RAF. In fact, I "patched" AF2 very effectively (with a system that forces me to either promote older tasks to the end, or kill them).<br><br>But I'd prefer to be in sync with Mark's developments (he's the expert). AF4 removed backward mode, and I don't see how it deals with urgent items better than AF1 (wasn't enough for me, I had to use additional tools).<br><br>But as usual with AF, I should try it before reaching conclusions. Even if I resist the idea.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Rob,<br><br>"Have you considered two AF4 lists? One for home and one for work."<br><br>That's what I used to do with AF1, and it certainly worked. But AF2 allowed me to use a single list, and its hard to go back.<br><br>Not only because of the overhead. I very seldom opened the Home list when I was using AF1.<br></div>

<div class="content">The way AF4 deals better with urgent stuff than AF1 is that in AF1, you would have to do something on EVERY page to prevent the entire page from being dismissed, before you could reach any urgent items near the end of the list.  With AF4, you only need to action ONE item from the closed list to prevent everything being dismissed, before moving on to the open list where your latest urgent items are.  Reading through the entire closed and open lists before reaching any urgent items near the end of the list helps me decide if there's really nothing hidden in either list that has become more urgent than the newer urgent tasks at the end.<br><br>I could imagine that if your work requires you to react to emergencies right away (like in NOW instead of within a few minutes) AF4 wouldn't work as well as AF2 or RAF.  For my work, I've noticed that AF2/RAF allows me to react to semi-emergencies much too quick, at the expense of more important stuff.  So for me, I think AF4 is going to work very well.  The only resistance I have in leaving AF2/RAF is that it just feels good to respond to emergencies, even when at the expense of more important (and often a bit more boring) older tasks.<br><br>Oh, and the other concern I have is the same as yours, Walter, dealing with Home and Work stuff.  I might go back to the dual mode list (work stuff from the top, home stuff from the  bottom) that I used in AF1, but I'll start with one integrated list first, to see how that works.</div>

<div class="content">Interesting points, Nicole.<br><br>I still see a problem with re-reading the whole backlog for each task that I finish in the active list. <br>I could use "common sense" and just skip it, but then, I would be cheating the system as it is.<br></div>

<div class="meta">2009-09-6 15:05</div>
<div class="content">Yep, I feel the same about re-reading the whole backlog.  So far I've managed not to cheat too much, but it feels like a chore, probably also because my list is rather long (>200 items).  I was hoping AF4 would speed up the dismissal process to reduce that, and I think it will, but not for a few days yet..</div>

After leaving the backlog, you could do every single task on the active list without ever going back to the backlog.</div>

<div class="content">Nichole, Walter,<br><br>1) As Andreas said, you might have misunderstood the instruction.  Step through his PDF and watch the system unfold as Mark did it, but in warp speed ;-)<br><br>2) You DO have to work through the entire backlog, perhaps several times, for each PASS through the open list.  BUT that is a GOOD thing.  It is what forces you to reach the point of dismissal as quickly as possible.  It is what makes the system fast.<br><br>3) You can't "cheat" a TM system.  It is there to serve your needs.  If you need to change the way you do things ... change them.<br><br>4) Yes, Mark is the expert, but he is mostly the expert on what works for him.  Remember, he is testing and developing based on how he does things.  If your environment is different, what works for you might be different.  I'm sure the very last thing Mark wants is to be seen as a Guru.  (Except, perhaps, if it advances his agenda to take over the world!  ;-)</div>

<div class="content">I guess I missed the instruction that you're supposed to read through the entire backlog, before taking any action on it.  <br><br>I don't see that in Mark's "preliminary instructions" -- he just says<br><br>3) You start with the Backlog. Look through the tasks in the Backlog in order and work on any tasks which feel ready to be done. Delete each task when you feel you have worked on it for long enough, and re-enter it at the end of the Active List if you need to do more work on it.<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2009/9/5/preliminary-instructions-for-autofocus-v-4.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2009/9/5/preliminary-instructions-for-autofocus-v-4.html</a><br><br><br>And I also didn't see it in the demo.<br><br>If I had to read through my backlog every single time I started afresh on the Closed List, this certainly wouldn't work for me.  <br><br>But as the rules are written, it's working GREAT!</div>

I have a full single pass through the active list. Maybe I could work it in reverse mode? Hm...<br><br>Anyway, I feel that the backlog receives more importance than the active list (multiple looping).<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Walter:<br><br>To answer your original query, in the circumstances you describe I would use a subsidiary list for the bug fixes. And if I had an unrelated task I wanted to do in the middle of bug fixing, then I would put it on the bug-fixing list.</div>

<div class="content">Mark, <br><br>Yes, the demo showed the change in proportion very well.  After a full day of processing my numbers went from: (open tasks on Closed list / open tasks on Open list)<br><br>29/73 Start Yesteday<br>21/99 End Yesterday<br>20/118 Now<br><br>My closed list is moving much slower than it would expect it to normally.  When I transferred my tasks from my other book for this experiment, I did not make them all "backlog".  I probably should have done that.  Since I drew the line more "logically" (IOW, what I felt was really the backlog) the few tasks on my closed list are really ones that were already about to be dismissed or needed to wait for the next business day (after a long holiday weekend).  I'll most likely dismiss sometime today then have about 130 or so tasks in backlog.<br><br>I'll bet with that much longer closed list, I'll have an entirely different experience than I am having now.  I can also see where the single pass of the open list will make much more sense as the list will only be 6 or 7 items to start.<br></div>

<div class="content">Mike:<br><br>My own experience is that I spend about the same amount of time on the backlog each time I visit it regardless of how big it is. <br><br>I move very fast through it when it is very big and most tasks (including all the easy ones!) are in it. <br><br>When it's smaller and more difficult I move slower and proportionally more of it gets done, but the overall time spent is very approximately the same.</div>

I built a system for bug management, but with AF2/RAF I've been neglecting it lately.<br><br>If its the first option, I would work similarly to when I was using AF1. One list for home, one for work (including bugs and other stuff).<br><br>I very much want to stay with a single list. Maybe I'll add a single task "Work on system X" and then I'll use my project management program to get into details. It was nice having all together, though, but maybe not ideal.<br><br>Thanks for answering. I'm going to start trying AF4 now.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Walter,<br><br>FWIW, my implemenatation is to have project and shopping lists and other things of that kind in the back of my book ... working twoard the front.  Then my entry is "Work on X" where "X" is a list in the back of the book where steps are listed.  While that is not exactly one "list", it does keep you in one "book".</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike,<br><br>Realistically, the proper place to list my bugs is in my dedicated system. Actually, I update them in both places.<br><br>But it's nice having them managed by AF, using intuition/dismissal and other AF features.<br>But its no big (or huge) deal. I didn't start trying AF4 yet. Maybe things will get arranged by themselves once I start.<br><br>Thanks</div>
