<div class="content">I like the idea of the 5 Task system in Secrets but I also like the 'Do 2 Add 2' of Michael's 4T. Which is why I've called this T4T.<br><br>Each day starts off with a Theme: an overriding focus on the day. Paperwork, meetings, errands, writing, etc.. This gets written at the top of the list (in different colour or style?)<br><br>Then the standard 4T system is used: list 4 tasks, do 2, add 2.<br><br>I've added a couple of extra elements:<br>* = urgent tasks. When something comes up urgently put an asterisk into the task list and add what needs to be done. This replaces one of the future 2 tasks to be added.<br>i / c = Interruption / Chaos. Whenever something interrupts you make a note and a brief description: c - phone call; c - kid crying, c - doorbell<br><br>With this you get the added bonus of seeing where things go out of sync and get to keep track of any urgent tasks that come along. Maybe adding a time stamp could be helpful too.<br><br>I've not yet tried this system but I'll like to know what others think of it.</div>

<div class="content">I've been using T4T today.<br><br>I got carried away doing a task and went onto the next task which wasn't on the list. This has led me to create a bracket element: an item did without looking at list first.</div>

<div class="content">Kenny:<br><br>I like what your addressing here. You're providing your mind with a real-time feedback loop built into your time management system. One's focus should naturally improve as the mind plainly sees the recurrent interruptions and self-sabotage occuring. Contrasting.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Michael, you're right.<br><br>It does help to see what's happening: today using T4T I didn't show any urgent tasks added or interruptions (though I did 'interrupt' myself before I started working). It'll be interesting to see how it works tomorrow when I'm working in the living room with my kids around!<br><br>What I'm finding help is having a weekly masterplan and a daily plan to help guide options when I'm running out of things to add to the list. Again it produces focus and has a feedback loop keeping me on task for my urgent tasks for the week. In fact all but 1 of my commitments have been completed already!</div>
