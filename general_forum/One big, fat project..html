<div class="content">A writing project is due in 7 days. I am behind. It will require a minimum of 56 concentrated hours to complete it in time and have it be at least acceptable.  <br><br>Here is the situation. <br>I have 4 active pages in my AF notebook with about 140 tasks outstanding.  One of those 140 tasks is "finish the script (writing project).   This one item is by far the most important work activity I ought to be putting my focus and all my time on.  And here is where I am having difficulty feeling the effortless motivation I felt using AF for the first three weeks of the beta.  Suddenly,  an apparently huge wall of resistance looms before me. <br><br>One idea is to chunk down all the little steps I will have to do to complete it.   The question is, what level of magnification should I use.  I could say, task-write outline, task-write first draft, task-write second draft. The wall remains high with that level of magnification.   The other extreme is to go to the end of my AF list and write; task-write 1 sentence.  <br><br>I know very well the steps of the process required for completing these particular writing projects.<br>1. outline<br>2. first draft<br>3. get notes from readers - usually ends up being about 60-70 actionable notes per draft.<br>4. write second draft<br>5.get  notes<br>6 polish<br>7. submit<br>8-nth. Notes -Write- Submit rinse and repeat 3-5 times. <br><br>Yet, the more I break the project down into these smaller phases of the process, the more unmotivated and depressed I feel.   Perhaps I need to turn the magnification up higher, get to that write a sentence/write a scene level, make a single entry in the AF book and see how it goes. <br><br>I already tried a day of  having a separate AF notebook for the project itself but I quickly became resistant to the whole list of tasks. <br><br>In terms of importance and priority, getting these big writing projects completed and out the door is the single most important activity of my work.  Nothing happens, no money, no forward movement, nothing at all until I get the written blueprints down on paper.<br><br>I guess I am looking for a method of using AF on these big projects that maintains the organic momentum I find in using AF for other areas of my personal and work life.   I believe the answer resides somewhere in the mix of "little and often" and the "optimum level of magnification of tasks" in the AF notebook. I just haven't found the trick on this one.   I look forward to hearing if other's have found how to get the most out of AF with big, all consuming projects.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hello Stark:<br><br>Your looming deadline horrifies me. Especially since I’ve been in the same situation, many times.<br><br>1 Your time estimate is PROBABLY overly optimistic. Speaking for myself, a realistic estimate would be 84 hours (1.5 x what you estimate) and more likely 112 hours (but then, I’m “slow”.)<br><br>2 That you are focusing on “what level of magnification should I use" ("I could say, task-write outline, task-write first draft, task-write second draft") is, to me, very good evidence that your resistance is, well, let’s just say “very high.”<br><br>3 How you write--how you start, how you revise, how many drafts, whatever--is entirely up to you. Me, I just have “mind dump”, revising, and final draft (looking for typos, cutting out redundancies, formatting for submission--all that stuff that takes WAY longer than we like to remember).<br><br>4 I recommend a mind dump, or whatever you want to call it. I call it that because it’s the place I start and it’s an easy way TO start and it recognizes that I’m collecting, in no order, without editing and without censoring, any and all thoughts, questions, snippets from various sources even remotely related to this writing.<br><br>5 So, you could write “script mind dump” at the end of your list (or, recognizing it’s beyond urgent, write it on a separate card.)<br><br>Then, step away from this blog and everything else and set your ktichen timer for a “short” period. For a project like this, I personally define “short” as at least one hour. (I’m more likely to choose 2 hours) but it could be truly short, like 30  minutes and start writing your mind dump.<br><br>Cross it off, write it again, set the timer again and repeat until you have enough to revise (which means, you know have a “draft” and it’s going to be easier--if still enormously time consuming--from here.<br><br>6 Just doing a mind dump is doing. It is an example of the short and often Mark Forster talks about. It’s gets us off our “but . . .s” and gets us into the project and it harnessses the power of our unconscious to start working on the project instead of working on the problem of why we’re not doing the project.  <br><br>(The other trick I use, besides the “mind dump” characterization, is to set myself the goal of writing the WORST script, etc or the WORST first draft. I’ll confess I fail at this goal because it’s usually surprisingly good, but it gets me going because there are no expectations and thus no fear.)<br><br>As Carol Lloyd, a writer about creativity says, “Doing is significantly different than not doing. Doing not only “gets things done’ it teaches lessons you cannot possibly learn theoretically and can loosen even the most stubbornly entrenched feelings [of fear, doubt’.”<br><br>7 But you know all this already. You wrote: “I know very well the steps of the process required for completing these particular writing projects.” And you also wrote: Suddenly, an apparently huge wall of resistance looms before me.”<br><br>You can’t really structure this resistance, which is what you’re trying to do with fiddling with how to break down the description of the “to do” steps in this project. You need to dissolve it. (Or do an end run around it, or whatever metaphor makes sense to you.) Starting--doing--will do that.<br><br>To overcome this resistance, set a timer and start writing.<br><br>As others have noted, I've never set a timer and now wound up engrossed in the project when the timer went off. (A variation on this is to to intervals--e.g. 45 minutes working, 15 minutes resting, 45 minutes working, etc, but I may need more than 15 minutes composting time so I just make sure I'm shifting my focus completely and then going back to my project.)<br><br>So, to repeat: set your timer!<br><br>Good luck!</div>

<div class="content">Stark:<br><br>You are talking about something that is going to take you 8 hours a day. There's no way you should be attempting to control this through Autofocus. <br><br>The best way to deal with a project which needs concentrated work like this is to isolate yourself from all distractions and block off 8 hours per day in your schedule. Refuse to allow yourself to do anything else other than the project during those 8 hours. <br><br>Use Autofocus outside those 8 hours for the other tasks you have.</div>

<div class="content">Also instead of "finish the script" which for me would set up a HUGE amount of resistance straight away, I would try writing "continue writing the script" since that doesn't have the scary thoughts associated with finishing something (perfectionism, etc.)<br><br>Just a thought, but I have found it helpful in the past.<br><br>Another one that I use is "start xyz" since that also isn't as scary as some other phrases you could write about a task...</div>

<div class="content">Hi Stark<br><br>I started AF with a large looming project of significant importance and did as Mark suggested in blocking off an entire day.  However in my case that did not feel right and I had a battle between what I felt and what my common sense was telling me.  In the end I did go with what I felt and cancelled that time block.  The amazing thing was that I came up with a totally different solution to what I would have done had I run with the time block (common sense) approach.   <br><br>I am certainly not advocating the route I took as a general suggestion - it was not "the sensible option" and could have left me in a complete mess (and the project is still not completed - will report back after Jan 31!) but it did work for me.  I guess what I am saying is, that when there is a situation like you describe that you would normally have dealt with but haven't under AF, *AND* AF is working for you in every other respect, then be aware that there may be another reason for the non-doing other than procrastination, and that AF is maybe alerting you to that fact.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Stark, Hi Mark, Hi Liz and everybody else,<br>Thank god you posted this issue today. I have been AFing since first day of Beta and have had all kinds of success, highs, lows, and sideways with it, but the one thing I haven't been able to do with it is......write my novel. Or the other $ making project I have. And they are both vitally key to my livelihood, health, happiness and peace.<br><br>I so relate to your post and was thinking of working on one myself but just...hadn't gotten around to it, or hadn't been attracted enough to it.<br><br>I have been thinking, oh, okay, chill on the novel bc I guess my subconscious thinks I need to get my armoire cleaned out first before I write my novel (due in 6 mos to agent) (okay 5 months now..), and geez better get those ipod speakers cranking before I write my novel, and anyways w AF I am sure to discover a method that will be beautifully applicable to my novel writing,and make it as easy as that armoire has turned out to be, but that hasn't happened and I have been sliding into depression, aimlessness and plain old fear that I will never get to it at all, that it's over for me. So to talk about a Writer's Block, I have a mother case of Writer's Block...pretty much like you do, Stark, poor guy.<br><br>I have also been down the road Stark describes and have been coming up with ways to apply AF to my writing project and all that's happened is even more resistance no matter what..<br><br>I am so happy to read what Mark has to say and also Liz (you are a genius!) and I feel somewhat off the AF hook with this one NOW. No matter how I put it on my list, I was never in this lifetime gonna be "attracted to it". Writing has its joys and enormous rewards, yes indeedy, but there is no way around it, it is akin to ditchdigging...with an imminent deadline.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Trish, but really, I just have a lot of experience procrastinating and helping others NOT to procrastinate (the “take my advice, I don’t use it” method of teaching.) And actually, I rarely procrastinate now, because I finally understand the obvious: if you do a little every day, after not very many days you have a lot done. <br><br>I love your description: “Writing has its joys and enormous rewards, yes indeedy, but there is no way around it, it is akin to ditchdigging...with an imminent deadline.”<br><br>The way I look at it is, CHOOSING to work 8 hours a day writing, or in my studio, is bliss. Being FORCED to work 8 hours a day--or  more likely, 20 hours a day--writing, or in my studio because a deadline is looming--is horrible. What if I get sick? What if a pipe bursts? What if I actually have an idea, a good idea, that could have been incorporated if I’d started sooner?<br><br>I was saddened that a step in Stark’s normal writing process (“get notes from readers - usually ends up being about 60-70 actionable notes per draft”) is going to get jettisoned, because there won’t be time to get feedback. <br><br>It seems to me that the lack of opportunity for feedback--which directly translates into the lack of opportunity to push the work further and make it better) is, besides physical and mental stress, the worst side effect of procrastination.<br><br>Mark’s right, of course (again, and as expected): Stark’s project is outside Autofocus. Both, as Mark notes, because it needs concentrated work (at least 8 hours a day) and, again, because Stark has procrastinated.<br><br>For both reasons, the time blocking technique is a good one: The next 8 hours (or large blocks around any tasks which absolutely can’t be deferred) is blocked off for the script.<br><br>Now, after blocking off the time, Mark says: "Refuse to allow yourself to do anything else other than the project during those 8 hours."<br><br>And I agree that’s great advice. And I also know that there are lots of ways to “refuse.” Hee. <br><br>Starting the ditch is very hard. And there are times when you hit obstacles and have to blast through rock, and that’s hard. That’s why I had to develop strategies to force myself to start and to help myself get unstuck.</div>

<div class="content">Matt C- "...but on those big ones, the jobs that get one's inner perfectionist pacing the floor and fretfully chewing its nails, I'm not sure there is any cure for the procrastinator other than panic."<br><br>If your inner perfectionist is bugging you, it is surprising how much difference it can make to add "write a bad first draft" to your list.  Because it is meant to be bad, the inner perfectionist is easily silenced, and it gives you a starting point for the next draft.</div>

<div class="content">I think it's important to say that my advice to block off 8 hours per day and not to attempt to control the project through AF was directed purely to Stark's situation where he (she?) has procrastinated to the extent that he *has* to put in that amount of time each day.<br><br>It's not the only way I would advise doing a writing project in more normal circumstances.<br><br>There's already been some correspondence about the best way of dealing with projects like writing, piano practice and so on which need a considerable amount of time. Most people find that the best way is to make their writing/practice periods time specific, but some people find other ways are better for them. It's a matter of experiment.<br><br>One way that can be very effective is to use reverse psychology and say "I am not going to spend *more* than four hours a day on this." If you're going to resist something, you might as well make it worth resisting!<br><br>Finally, remember a writer is a person who writes, not a person who thinks about writing.</div>

<div class="content">I so empathise with Stark and Trish. I am not a writer, but I am doing a postgrad and I am a decade behind where I should be, and so my 'script' or my 'novel' is my thesis.<br><br>I am resisting because I'm afraid of failure, afraid of success (what will I do afterwards?), a perfectionist, and I'm overwhelmed. Perhaps there are other reasons of which I'm not yet aware. My tutor tells me he is yet to meet a writer who actually enjoys the act of writing.<br><br>I've been reading about 'self-handicapping' recently. This is different to self-sabotage because you don't deliberately trash your efforts (not turning up to the exam), you just introduce an artificial level of difficulty (not beginning revision early enough, so you never do quite as well as your ability would ordinarily suggest). <br><br>Apparently it is caused by problems of self-image, self-worth, and self-esteem. In the research I saw, it tended to affect most those students whose natural ability put them in the top 10% of their class. Basically, you think you're a pretty good student, so you can get away with "good enough" despite minimal revision. Because you haven't tried your hardest, you get to protect your inner belief that you are amongst the very best in the class without having that inner belief (which may be embedded at the very core of your psyche) ever really challenged.<br><br>So I guess the answer is to build your reserves of self-esteem; divorce your sense of self-worth from your achievements; and diminish the 'threat' that your script/ novel/ thesis/ equivalent of exams is having on your psyche.<br><br>Easy huh?! I've got the theory, now I just need to make it work ;-))</div>

<div class="meta">2009-01-26 11:38</div>
<div class="content">Liz, I love your practical tips and little b those comments regarding "self handicapping" are really enlightening.<br><br>I really believe for me that AF will make a big difference but can see that a lot of that difference is going to be a future event, simply because of the backlog situation I have gotten myself into.  There is no getting away from the fact that some projects need time blocks spending on them and I know for me that that will always be a part of AF, the only (and a pretty significant only!) difference being that those time blocks will be when I want to do them, and, will be enjoyable.  I am already experiencing that to a degree where I am enjoying doing things I could not believe I would ever, in a month of Sundays, enjoy!<br><br>The post I made above is very specific to my situation; I had, at the beginning of AF, set time blocks, but then deliberately cancelled them.  That is not an approach I would ever  recommend, but what it did for me was to identify that there was in fact a better way to actually do the task.  I guess my subconscious somehow knew that if the task done in "the correct way" only needed a week, then the actual start deadline was a lot different to what my conscious mind believed.  <br><br>I really believe these issues will start to be resolved as we become more experienced in listening to "our inner voice" but the fact remains that when we have a major project with a fixed deadline, that must by necessity be treated outside of the normal AF rules.  I suspect that the lessons we all learn from the particular "bete noirs" that afflict us will have a significant influence on the methods we employ to handle such things in the future.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Stark<br>I recently finished a floundering project using AF.<br>Not as big as yours,but important nevertheless career wise.<br>Here's what I did:<br>1.List all the subtasks on index cards and add them to the first active page of the AF notebook<br>2.Then treat the index cards and the active page as a single list<br>3.Work on stand out items on the cards as usual,crossing off,reentering,rephrasing and dismissing etc<br>4.Add other tasks to the cards as they come up.<br><br>What works with this method is that you can CHOOSE your index card project tasks over the others on the list or indeed over other project related tasks.And it is this freedom of choice that neutralises my natural tendency to resist things and motivates me.<br>Also,by crossing off things even after you've made a small amount (any) of progress AF allows me to counteract my tendency to perfectionism.<br>It is these 2 (lack of choice and perfectionism) that paralyse me when I'm overwhelmed.<br>Ideally if you have AF working well you will avoid crises like these cos youll have worked little and often on things.<br>But I believe it CAN be used to facilitate the actual input needed in crises like yours.<br>Good luck<br><br>Jay</div>

<div class="content">I have taken liberally from the generous ideas and reminders from all who posted here. <br>Liz I: <br>The timer was dusted off and has been my trusty task master. For bits of writing I am especially avoiding, I do super sprints  using a timer that dings every 2 minutes.  I use Marks trick of saying, "I am only allowed to do 2 minutes on the scene, then move on." It always motivates me and I inevitably spend more than 2 minutes on the particular bit I am working on.  And, if I am really stumped, I move on after 2 minutes. <br>Mark:<br> I have sequestered myself since Sunday. Always effective. First draft was completed yesterday. <br>Hannah:  <br>I am now saying "write some scenes" rather than "finish the project."<br>Matt C:<br>Pressure has built to the combustion level. The fire is quite hot under my seat now.<br>Christine: <br>Not in this case. Just pure unadulterated procrastination. I will say that this project was started in early December long before AF when I was living the "a little bit, rarely" lifestyle. I am eager to get a fresh run at one of these projects with the AF system. <br>Trish: <br>Thanks for coming clean. Many parts of writing just plain suck. But I have great success when I turn my attention to the fun parts and get curious about what far out things these characters will suggest next.<br>Liz I and Trish and other ditch diggers: <br>Here is a great dilemma I like to pose to my  inner-avoider: I can either choose to get excited about remaining focused on the writing job at hand, or, I can choose to get a job digging ditches. He shuts up pretty quickly after that. <br>Liz I: <br>Yes, I recognize the lack of planning and less time for  little and often does short the feedback opportunities. I look forward to practicing full AF on the next project.<br>Mark: <br>He/she is a he. And a good resistance tip forbidding myself to work any more than x hours.  <br>little b: <br>Also a great reminder about maintaining a slightly detached state.  Again, if I focus on what do I love about this or what am I excited to discover, I forget all about the individuals sitting in the audience with folded arms.  <br>Jay: <br>I'm not entirely clear how you are using the index cards.  Why not just list the items on the AF last page?  I agree totally with you about choice within limits to defeat procrastination. <br><br>I have returned to using a separate AF list for this specific writing project.  It has helped give me the boost of choice within a structured closed list and a set chunk of time. The AF list has a strange calming effect on my mind when contemplating the number of hours I have to remain in my writing chair.  This is one of the great benefits of Mark's AF system; it snaps me out of my panic.<br><br>One last thought. I am always reluctant to print my work and hand it over to my trusted readers. The fear about their imagined negative reaction can be completely paralyzing.  Yet, the process of forcing my self to overcome this resistance, to just hit the PRINT button and get it into their hands, has always resulted in huge surges of ideas and productivity.  The key is to use readers who ignite my creativity rather than those who give un-productive feedback. <br><br>Now, back to work.</div>

<div class="content">I found this an interesting thread (and hope Stark got done with the project). I have a novel due in five months, a screenplay adaptation due in about the same time, and have a short story due in two months (which is nearly done). I was intrigued by AF (esp. after seeing how many of the people in the Myers-Briggs test were INFPs, my type) but I couldn't quite wrap my head around how I would track my daily output on AF. I'm a bit behind on the novel and need to write about 3000 words a day to finish my first draft on the original schedule so I have time for a proper rewrite. I suppose I could write "write 1000 words" three times rather than the bigger task. I think one of the challenges is how do you make this work for creative tasks that literally fill 80-90% of your working day?</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Stark. I am just having trouble wrapping my head around if I spend most of my day writing 3000 words, how to best represent that on an AF list. Of course I have other obligations (research, marketing, etc.), but none are more important professionally than actually generating that steady word count. If I let other tasks "jump out at me" before that one, then I just feel like I'm procrastinating.</div>
<h2>Reply by Stark</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-02-16 17:44</div>
<div class="content">Inkstain,<br>I understand.  I exclude the marketing tasks and keep then in my main AF. The project AF is for the creative and editorial tasks only. For generating the first draft, I am breaking down the tasks into a 3 part rhythm of 1. Review the 1 page summary, 2 Outline next scene ahead, 3 Write active scene. I  enter these 3 steps into the project AF list ahead about 4 or 5 scenes at a time.  These chunks sit amongst other single tasks in the AF list and I know they are the most important things on the list.  When I set a page or scene goal for the writing day that is part of the delivery schedule, it gives the AF list even sharper focus.  If I ignore this sharper focus, I get sharp shooting pains in my skull and every moment of procrastination makes me nauseous.  Sometimes I simply do indulge the unimportant stand outs but these guilty pleasures at least help get the ball rolling.  Breaking things down as I have described is an effective trick for me to get me moving in the right direction of writing.  The trick of checking off broken down tasks in the AF list makes me witness that progress is being made.   My next draft is due tomorrow. I will be writing for 7 hours today and tomorrow to make this deadline. If I don't break things down into smaller chunks,however artificial they may be, I easily get freaked out by the bigger deadline.  I would be interested to hear how breaking your 3000 word goal into smaller chapter or scene chunks entered in AF works for you.  Back to work.</div>
