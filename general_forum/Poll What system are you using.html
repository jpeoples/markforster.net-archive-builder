<div class="content">It's been a while since we've had a system poll. What system are you using and paper or electronic?<br><br>If you are not using a "system" per se, then please describe the principles, methods, and/or tools that you use to help get things done.</div>

<div class="content">I'm always tweaking my systems, but here's where I am at the moment. Recognizing that no system will take over the responsibility of working for me, or making decisions on what to do for me, my goal is to create a system that will help me do the right thing at the right time for the right reason. But the ultimate responsibility for that will be mine alone. Having said that,  I describe the system that I use as a combination of 4 "states;"<br>State 1: do it now. The focus in this state is always what is immediately in front of me. I make my bed first thing in the morning, throw the garbage away, do my dishes, answer the phone, respond to emails as they come in, if I can. What I'm trying to develop here is a "do it now" habit, a kind of bias towards action. I owe a lot on this to Kerry Gleeson's Personal Efficiency Program. I consider this to be my basic state of work as I move through my day, my "default" framework if you will. But, sometimes things come across my reality that I can't do right away, or I can't finish what's immediately in front of me, hence...<br>...State 2: backlog. For me, this is simply Random + FV. Anything I can't do now gets on my backlog - a handwritten list in a moleskin notebook. There is also room here for larger projects which I track using Daylite. Hopefully state 1 keeps state 2 from being too overwhelming, but either way, most of my daily work is in these two states. I owe everything about this state to Mark's work and this forum. But it would be a sad life if all we did was work, so I add two more "states:<br>...State 3: leisure. - relaxation, vacation, prayer and meditation, recreational reading, socializing, etc. <br>...State 4: organization - this is an opportunity to examine my working systems from higher levels, to see if my goals are being met, tweak new systems. I'm in that state right now. David Allen's 10000+ level's are a good way of describing this. All four states could also be in Quadrant 2 of Stephen Covey. <br>One question that I struggle with is how to know when to move from one state to another. My answer at the moment: whenever I feel like it. I let intuition be my guide here. Seems to work well for me, especially between state 1 and state 2. Interested in your comments.</div>

<div class="content">I realized recently that my system is my Blackberry Z10 smartphone. <br><br>Central is my CAF4 (<a href="../general_forum/Context-AF4.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2446303</a> ) using the Speedy Checklist app (<a href="http://speedychecklist.net/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://speedychecklist.net/</a> ).  I do not think I will be looking for another way of handling tasks because it just fulfills all of my wants in a task system: being able to plan, accommodates projects, allows working on emerging tasks (tasks that call my attention to be done now or later even if they were not originally planned for prior) and continuing tasks (tasks that take time to do and can be left for themselves while I do something else, for example laundry) without losing what you were working on previously, flexibility and variety in handling and processing tasks.  The smartphone's OS boasts an excellent virtual "intelligent" keyboard that allows quick input, and the app's simple and intuitive interface allows quick manipulation of items.<br><br>BB10's "Hub" integrates email, text messages, and alerts and interpersonal messages from other apps and websites like Facebook, Twitter, and BBM into one place; no email backlog for me since I always look at them everytime someone texts me and everytime I look at Facebook and Twitter, and I can answer right away because of the excellent virtual keyboard.<br><br>I have set my calendar so that deadlines and special events show up 1 week in advance so that they can be added to my CAF4 list.<br><br>So yeah, it's a sweet setup, and I just realized recently how sweet it is.</div>

<div class="meta">2015-04-7 3:22</div>
<div class="content">Austin,<br>Not a very complicated method. I think I got the idea from a book (autor's name escapes me...) where you have 3 lists. The "current, or 'do today', list. The "soon", or 'within 2 weeks', list. And the "over the horizon, or 'more than 3 weeks out', list. <br>The author's thought is that tasks/projects are coming at us on a conveyor belt. We should be actively taking care of some of them (the 1st list), while monitoring the 2nd list so that things don't sneak up on us and become last minute urgent. The 3rd list ist to keep an eye (maybe bi-weekly) on things that might be jumping on the conveyor belt.<br>I like the idea, but I'm just too simple of a person to even seperate things so much. So I merely made 2 lists. An "active one" and a "non-active" one. The active list is things I have to do (urgent and time sensitive) as well as things that are currently taking brain power in my life. The non-active contains things that I'd like to do, but just don't (for whatever reason) find myself engaged with. <br>Simple...? Certainly! But so am I, and this helps me have a handle on life!<br>note: just because I have somthing "active" doesn't mean it's 'due' today or even this week. It may be a project that isn't due for months, yet I can still be actively working on aspects of it.</div>

However since there is always stuff arriving there is no need to divide it up into separate lists. You just do it all. To prevent interruptions you put a 24 hour delay into the process, except for stuff that needs to be done quicker the same day.</div>

Doing would be your active list, the Backlog your non-active. A potentially useful aspect that Kanban adds to the mix is to limit your WIP (Work In Progress), i.e. the number of items in the "Doing" column, in order to increase your throughput.<br><br>I recently re-read Jim Benson's book "Personal Kanban", which gives some good ideas and principles. I'm currently experimenting with it, but I'm still not convinced that it really suits me as well as AF1, SF or FV do (so I keep my FV list in the background)...</div>

<div class="content">My main "system" nowadays:<br><br>(1) Focus is on my calendar (Outlook) and daily checklist (paper taped into DIT notebook) to give "shape" to my day<br>(2) DIT to capture and work tasks (in a paper notebook) (with some modifications).  Work today's list, if nothing stands out then work backwards on previous days to see if there's anything open.<br>(3) OneNote for capturing details about projects, actions that come out of meetings<br><br>The modifications to standard DIT that I'm finding useful:<br>(1) Every Monday, "dismiss" everything left open from the previous week (highlight as per AF1)<br>(2) Scan the "dismissed" items every few days to see if there's anything I should re-enter, or to delete<br>(3) Treat weekends separately as a single "day" - put most personal tasks on the next available weekend page.   If I have time during the week in the evenings or lunchtime, I can work forward on these weekend pages.   This helps keep distinction between "work" and "personal".   <br><br>The "Current Initiative" idea from DIT is really helpful.  It's the first thing on my daily checklist.  I try to work on this every day before my meetings ramp up for the day.   Making it a daily focus makes a huge difference in getting traction and getting things finished.<br><br>When the meetings of the day start up, I try to finish my DIT Task List in between meetings, while also scanning emails for anything urgent (otherwise ignoring them).<br><br>At the end of the day, follow my "wrap up" routine which mainly means clearing all inboxes.<br><br>This works really well on days not too heavy with meetings.  It also highlights that, for me, the real bottleneck is having too many meetings.</div>

The only trouble comes when the list becomes very huge. I found it as AF un manageable and very difficult for mastering projects. <br><br>When I was a young boy I red something. I forgot the author. The principle was indeed simple. 2 list. One call master list and one today's list. The principle was If I well remember collecting all in the master list then extract each night some items which will become your today's list. There was priorities on that list (A, B, C, D) and they where numbered from one to ten. <br>Then the principle was to do the list from one to ten. <br><br>It was difficult to choose and my main problem was about choosing the items and do it one by one. But it worked quiet well in my business. <br><br>Now I am 53 and I realize that no mater is the number of items or projects. The real aim is to do first was must be done to realize was you vision is. <br><br>It is easy to explain. It is very hard to do. I still struggle with this. <br>All MF systems are for acting and avoid procrastination. GTD is trying to do a commun global system. I succeed for a while when I am focus on what I do and when at the end of the week i can say : well I did my best to fusfill my weekly objectives and the result is that....</div>

<div class="content">In celebration and anticipation of Mark Forster's upcoming Perfect system, here's the one I've been using for the past weeks. I had been actually tempted to call it my "perfect" system too because it just works perfectly for me: minimal resistance, universal capture, minimal need for additional equipment (aside from a pen or coin plus your memory, no need for additional randomizing tools), allows brainstorming, allows projects, allows planning, handles urgent tasks, usable in electronic or pen and paper format, handles big as well as small lists.<br><br>It has one core rule and a few provisional rules. <br><br>This is the core rule: Separate tasks by day written. All unactioned tasks more than 2 weeks old are dismissed. I found that two weeks is the "sweet spot" where I will not be be feeling guilty nor flustered in dismissing tasks even if I had not picked up my list for a few days, while there is minimal due pressure, and thus resistance, in acting on tasks due to the feeling there is too little time for the task to "stew" in your mind. <br><br>Because of the time-based dismissal, there is much freedom one can have in processing the list. You can pick one task or more per run, use randomization or "standing out" or FV and it will not affect the core rule. Also, the time based dismissal already limits the size of the list. Just following the core rule thus gives you already a robust task management system. <br><br>The provisional rules are actually ways of processing of the list that I found to be most effective by experience. <br><br>1. Choose a root task. <br>A. Scan from the top of the list down, looking for a task that is either time-sensitive (best done on the hour you are in) or leisurely if you have been doing hard tasks for the past hour or so. Mark that task. <br>B. If you cannot find such a task, then you can use semi-randomization. <br>• Pick a string of numbers that you are going to use for the day. Divide the string into a series of reasonably countable numbers. Dates are recommended. For example, the date today, May 9, 2015, can be changed to 5, 9, 20, and 15. <br>• Use either a pen or coin to know which number you are going to use next for counting down from the last actioned task. If you are going to use a pen: spin your pen on the table. If it is pointing towards you, use the number to the right of the last number you used; if away, use the number to the left. Alternatively, flip a coin. <br><br>2. Find tasks in context of the root task, if needed. You can use this if you want to brainstorm or plan. Mark them, then if needed number them (including the root task) in the order you want them done. You can also mark more tasks anytime when urgent tasks arise. Alternatively, you may refrain from marking in context tasks and just do the root task. <br><br>And that's it. I love the semi-randomization, it is quite fun to spin the pen to know the next task I need to do. It certainly reduces resistance. Also, the picking of same-context tasks makes planning, brainstorming, and projects possible.</div>

<div class="content">This is my current system. It has been working very well for me since late last year:<br><br>Write a list. Everything goes on the list (but see notes below).<br><br>Work the list in order. You cannot skip an item, but you have options for each item:<br><br>1. Cross it off<br>2. Do it and cross it off<br>3. Do some of it, cross it off and rewrite at the end of the list<br>4. Schedule it on calendar and cross it off<br>5. Don’t do it, but cross it off, split it into two new tasks and write them at the end of the list<br><br>Notes:<br><br>Don’t put stuff on the list that you do every day anyway, or things that you do at the same time every day. For instance, I never forget to check my email, and I always have my lunch at 12.30pm.<br><br>If it is really urgent, just do it and ignore the list.<br><br>The list never seems to get too long for me, so things don't hang around for long.</div>

<div class="content">I've been doing DIT for nearly a year and I really love how it keeps me on top of all my work and how I know when I've finished work for the day.<br><br>It works especially well at my job where the vast majority of my tasks are daily recurring items.<br><br>I like to work little and often using GED timed bursts (5/10/15...minutes until the item is finished for the day). Instead of rotating around the tasks, I usually use the randomizer to process the list, or occasionally FV. Doing this brings almost no resistance to my work and I actually look forward to picking up my list and working it until finishing the lot.<br><br>I have no trouble completing the list each day - I'm usually able to finish work at the office early, but I don't usually finish my personal items until about 10pm. Mainly this is due to a lot of daily recurring tasks that take time (I think the main culprits are my anki decks, exercise routines, and Dreams exercises). Like I said, I enjoy working the list, even if its til late into the night. However, I had a strange realization recently when my sister drew the fact to my attention that I worked so late every night. It really made me think that I was spending a lot of time in 'push mode', to use a Dreams term.<br><br>I made further realizations when one day soon after that I decided to process my list with AF instead of the Randomizer - I was really surprised that hardly any of these recurring items stood out - it really made me think that perhaps I was spending too much time on activities that deep down I didn't actually feel like doing. I thought that maybe I'd make an effort to stop work by 7pm, and then if/when I got behind I would audit my commitments. Instead today I decided to process my DIT lists using AF for a few days, if nothing more than to evaluate items properly after they get dismissed and see how it would affect my DIT usage.<br><br>Although I must say that I can't wait for Mark's Perfect system to be announced, which I will probably put into practice ASAP.<br><br>P.S Just wanted to say thanks Mark - I've got all of your books and I could spend hours reading your thoughts and suggestions. They've had a very positive impact on my productivity, for which I am grateful.

<div class="content">@Wooba,<br><br>I like how you do your system, very simple. I will be borrowing the idea and see if it works well with my own. Here is how I am planning (I am keeping the core rule by the way so I can go back to my regular system if it does not go well):<br><br>• Scan from the end of the list upwards for a task that is either time-sensitive (best done on the hour you are in) or leisurely if you have been doing hard tasks for the past hour or so. <br>• If you were not able to pick a task with the previous step, select the first (oldest) unactioned task in your list. <br>• Scan the system again and mark tasks that are of same context as the first marked ("root") task. You can number these tasks in the order you want to do them. You can also skip this step if you want; alternatively, you can mark tasks in the middle of doing the other tasks (for example emergent tasks).</div>

<div class="content">I'm so glad that I happened to discover AutoFocus when I did, because I was just about ready to go crazy with a very elaborate implementation of GTD which would have rapidly devolved into chaos for many reasons.<br><br>The biggest reason for such failure is that I'm attracted to schemes that involve a lot of planning and analysis and scheduling and prioritizing. I LOVED Covey when I got my very first planner. However, I could never follow such a detailed plan (least of all my own) if my life depended on it. Planning engages my rational mind, but following plans triggers some kind of intractable rebellion of my creative mind.<br><br>I've also tried die rolls, coin flips, slips of paper in a jar, and similar strategies, hoping that the element of chance or surprise would have the opposite effect of overplanning, but that doesn't work. <br><br>Hand-picking a few items off of a long to-do list to create a quick agenda for the day has also been unhelpful. It seems that I am incapable of obeying a piece of paper. I spend so much time fretting over what I "should" be doing that I end up doing nothing at all. What a waste!<br><br>I figure it's high time I faced reality and found a way to work around that. I wasn't always so stressed out; there was a time when I didn't think at all about urgency vs importance. I did something, or I did something else, and somehow it all got done and there was still time for a nap. And no guilt or stress!<br><br>Right now AF looks like my best bet for that. It's simple. I'll have choices. I'll have it all written down, so I won't lose or forget anything, but I'll also have an algorithm that encourages me to move on instead of wringing my hands over the things that I didn't do.<br><br>The only other system I've had any success with at all is something like the Planner Pad, and only to deal with a particular type of week when I have to keep track of a lot of time-sensitive errands and appointments. Like, all of December, preparing for parties and meals and other events, along with shopping and renewing my car registration sticker and dealing with other end-of-year tasks. I do a page for each week, with a daily breakout of all the scheduled items, and a context-based list of ONLY THE REQUIRED TASKS AND ERRANDS that I need to juggle for that week. That makes it a little easier to make sure that I'll have time to do everything that I need to do, but doesn't paralyze me with unnecessary detail.<br><br>I've tried to use this format to get more done during the weeks that aren't so complicated, but it never works. If a task isn't required, then putting it on a schedule virtually guarantees that it won't be done. In fact, I feel that non-required items actually "cheapen" the schedule.<br><br>I should probably mention that all of the above applies mainly to my personal time. I'm much better at managing my work-related obligations, but that's because they're real obligations with monetary rewards. I don't have enough self-discipline left over after work and on weekends to motivate myself to pursue my lofty goals unless I can maybe trick myself into it with AF.<br><br>A big plus with AF for me is that it actually discourages batching. There are certainly times when batching (from a context list) is helpful, but I've often caught myself delaying a whole group of tasks because they were in a batch/context list. Every time I looked at that list, I'd see a handful of daunting items that I'd been putting off for months. I felt that I should do those things first, but I didn't want to do them at all, so instead I'd avoid the entire batch. (It sounds crazy when I say it, but I know I'm not the only person who's ever done that.) <br><br>So I just started my AF list last night and started working it today. I will maybe use color-coded dots to identify certain types of batchable items in my AF lists, so that I can quickly knock off two or three of them at a time if I feel like it. But I will make the dots really small to avoid the temptation of "organizing" everything back into contexts, and I won't dot any item that seems likely to to ruin a whole batch.<br><br>While I wait for the Most Perfect Time Management System Ever, I'll give AF a chance. I'm pretty sure it won't make things any worse!<br><br>...good heavens, I didn't mean to babble on so much. I'm just excited to be trying something that might actually work for a change!</div>

<div class="content">@julie<br>I so agree with you  all you described so well in your post stricktly happened to me. even the feelings and what you tried to improve your way of doing things  <br>I am always balanced beetween chaos and strict lists . after tears of testing i<br>I think that stuff obeys to some simples rules. one is to collect in a sole system. i also admit that mf system is really great because it follows how your brains works. i think we can focus on a project for a while. but the truth is that we are multi thinking. ideas comes in chaos (ie one afrer the other and un organized) and we have to clear the list and decide what is worth working on. i am very curious about Mf new system hope it will be helfull</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Michael and Jupiter. It's finally hitting me, the irony that virtually every time/task management system I've ever paid any attention to has ignored a very significant issue: most people have a hard time getting around to certain kinds of tasks. This difficulty is what drove me to seek newer, fancier systems. I keep hoping that a new page layout in a daily planner will somehow transform me into a super-motivated productivity machine. I keep thinking a new electronic gadget or browser add-on will somehow dazzle me with its space-age carrots-and-sticks technology. <br><br>In can see now that all of those things are variations on a handful of themes that have already failed me repeatedly. It feels good to finally realize that, and let it go. Just as some martial arts work by letting you use your opponent's size and power to your own advantage, "structured procrastination" should theoretically let me procrastinate in a productive way.<br><br>Most Sunday nights, I am angry with myself for failing to accomplish anything or even enjoy myself during the weekend. I am not expecting miracles this weekend, but I suspect (and hope) that I will feel much better than usual 48 hours from now. Here's hoping!</div>

<div class="content">I fell off FV bandwagon some time ago. Checking my <a href="http://checkvist.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://checkvist.com</a> archive it was about November 2014. While waiting for Mark's new system, I am restarting FV (with a touch of AF) as Jupiter described in <a href="../fvp_forum/Report about FV after over monthes of testing- my way....html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/fv-forum/post/2481176</a> . I will be doing it on paper using my trusted "go anywhere" A7 notebooks.</div>

<div class="content">I am using a simple system I wrote about on my blog called Forward Motion Time Management.  It is a departure from what I was using before which was a single notebook for everything, as it got too cluttered.  I wrote about it last year and then used something else and realized it is the best system for me as it puts all of the actions I need in one place, keeps everything moving forward and has only one real rule.  After the system, the rest are just ideas I found to be useful time saving ways to organize things.<br><br>Here it is <br><br><br>Forward Motion Time Management is a simple paper based time management system which automatically handles everything in your life including most projects. A key feature of the system is the concept of forward motion which is described below. The system handles projects very simply. A project is nothing more than a series of tasks designed to accomplish an outcome. You do not need a separate project list because the tasks are a result of the fact you have undertaken a project. How the System Works You create a running list of tasks in a bound notebook. An ideal cheap way to do this is a lined student composition book. These are cheap and readily available. If you like a more expensive notebook like a Moleskine, no problem. Each task takes up one line and one line only. A task is defined as a something that can be done in less than say a couple of hours. In the margin you put the new date. This provides a reference as to when the task came into existence and serves as psychological pressure to get things done. <br><br>An example of an acceptable task is pick tile for bathroom. An unacceptable task is build dream house. The system can handle build a dream house as you will see, but it accomplishes it naturally and effortlessly by breaking it up into the tasks that are processed to make it a reality. This system is designed to work best on paper. It is faster and easier to maintain the system using paper and is portable as well. Typing using list software is actually more time consuming than simply using a composition notebook, so use paper. How it works in Practice – Forward Motion Forward Motion is how the “system” handles projects and keeps us in action and productive. If after you have completed a task, there is a logical next task or action you need to take, you write it at the end of the list. You then scan the entire list and do the task your mind tells you to do. When you finish a task related to a project, you line through the task you have completed and add the next task needed to ensure forward motion of the project at the end of the list. An example - After you have picked the bathroom tile, you cross it off the list by lining through it (a clear ruler is helpful). You then add to the end of the list – pick bathroom paint. After adding the next task you scan the list. Your mind will tell you after scanning the list what needs to be done next and what you can cross off it is no longer a task you need to complete. <br><br>There is no processing algorithm with this system you trust your mind. There is no replacement for the power of your mind to let you know what you need to do, nor is there a replacement for the self-discipline to actually do it. After finishing a task scan the list and your mind will guide you to what you need to accomplish next. Other Aspects of Life Other tasks on the list may not require forward motion. An example someone calls and leaves you a message because they need a phone number you have. You put on the list – Call Bob and give him Alice’s phone number. When you are done, it is just crossed off. Other concepts One Line You use only one line per task. This is enough space to note the task and any basic information you need to complete it. So a task could be; Call Bob @ XXX-XXX-XXXX Email Joe – Joe@joe.com Review Cool New Project – file in cabinet Calendar You still need a calendar for appointments and places you need to be at a certain time. The system is not the appropriate place for your dentist appointment, it is however the place to put – call to make a dental appointment. Use electronic or paper for your calendar your choice. Notes Do not keep notes in this notebook, it will get too jumbled. It is ok to note phone numbers, addresses and emails as they will fit on one line and need to be handy when running errands, returning call and emailing. Keep notes in files. It is ok to keep a separate notepad as long as once a week you flip through it and file what you need to keep and prune the rest. For this I recommend a simple legal pad as it is easiest to tear off the notes for filing. A – Z filing system Use a simple A – Z filing system which will make life infinitely easier. Keep and use paper folders with handwritten descriptions and some kind if cabinet or system for the folders. Use years or a second description if needed. Examples – Paid Bills 2013, Paid Bills – 2012. I have found that more time is lost searching for things and replacing lost items than any time management system can save you. Being organized saves time. Trust me your life will be streamlined and clean if you adopt this simple method. Use the list to create tasks like review file for home project. Life will be streamlined and clean. I have a new slogan Files Not Piles A to Z is the simplest system for filing, as it is intuitive. Your mind will guide you to things. Don’t be afraid of larger groupings. I use things like Paid Bills – 2013. I just don’t need a file for every bill I paid in 2013 as very rarely do I need to find a paid bill and when I do flipping through the file takes less time than making dozens of files for individual vendors and utility companies. Once a year in a less than an hour you can prune out what files you don’t need. You do not put things that are habits into the system. So if you routinely exercise, walk the dog, mow the lawn and get your dishes done don’t put these into the system it will clutter it up.</div>
