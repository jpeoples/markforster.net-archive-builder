<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-10-9 7:34</div>
<div class="content">I noticed that i wrote many double beam writing AF4 so I tried yesterday to put it on a single digital page. I thought it could be usefull when i will have my Ipad. Instead of rewriting all i wrote the most important things and call a new title "MY WEEKLY WILL DO LIST"<br>I grouped all about a project together and jump a line after and befor the last item. <br>I finaly put the list on my dock to see it at a glance when i need it <br>I kept my paper list for the regular treatement f AF.<br><br>So to be clear I have 2  list<br>one is on paper on my AF notebook and everything is on it<br>one is on my computer extracted from my AF note book and is a will do list <br><br>One the first one i put everyrhing without any control and it is handwritten<br>the secont is digital and just use at a focus on what i must absolutly do. <br><br><br>I noticed 2 interesting improovement<br>1. all very important things are grouped together. So I can do it easely and i dont need any project list because all important things are on my will do list.<br>2. It's a will do list so I clear all I dont want to do and keep the best of AF <br>3. I am not distracted by the computer because I still have my paper AF where everuthing is. <br>4. I can use many software from word to page, takpaper and so on<br>5. It is fast it took my 5 mn for 10 written pages <br>6. I can date the arrivals of things on my paper AF<br>7. I can see on my will do list all about a project and all together on a batch<br>8. It can be updated each night in 5 mn and let me focus on most important things. <br>9. It will easely go on my ipad because it is on page. But i could do it on google doc too. <br>I admit its simple. I gona try to do it next week and update it each day after work for the next day. If you wish I will report this experiment. Next week I put it on my diary ;-)</div>

<div class="content">So, to be clear Jupiter, your written list is now just a master list, from which you cull tasks that stand out to you into a weekly list.<br><br>Maybe your intuition has less of a chance to work here, since you are in a sense prioritising your tasks in a single sweep.</div>

<div class="content">I didnt think about that. ! you may be true. I thougt the digital one more like a collection of bigs rocks to stay focus on the most important things because since I went back to AF the list has increased considerably (almost 10 A4 pages) but I admid the activity is for the moment very very high !!!</div>

<div class="content">Hmmm...does seem like a lot of stuff. I know you have written about your experiences elsewhere, but have you considered the following:<br><br>1. If its part of a project, collating individual tasks into a separate project action list? That would help you become "project-centric" and allocate your big rocks into focused project action tasks;<br><br>2. Checklists for regular or upkeep tasks, something Nunty talks about in another post. I remember Mark talking about batch processing related tasks - emails, paper, etc. Both are similar concepts which I have found useful. For example, a financial upkeep task could be a list consisting of (1) checking bank account (2) reconciling statements (3) budgeting for the month (4) doing ad-hoc transfers.<br><br>Just some ideas. Apologies for the repetition if I've talked about things you may have described in other posts and are already doing.<br><br>Big Rocks I think are nothing more than our own intuition wanting to pick out items or projects that are important to us. So by maybe having a less detailed AF list and a separate detailed projects list can help you de-focus and choose the big rocks that are important to you.</div>

<div class="content">Thank yo so much JD for the help and the ideas. God bless people who help each others. <br><br>If i understand : 1. If its part of a project, collating individual tasks into a separate project action list? => it means do the contrary that what i do ie:<br>Manage my project like on GTD with a single page. (easy it 's done)<br>then put all my detailed tasks on this project <br>Then go back to af and report nothing but work on project X or DO this part of the project. and then look at the master project.<br><br>2. Checklist : I use them for current initiative but it is a very good idea i could use more. For treating things as a batch. the process is the same for most of things ie financial, studying buildings, treating clients needs etc...<br><br>I think you are right. I dont know why i have't try this before Let's so....</div>

<div class="content">just something practical i wonder. If the project is digital (ie a word sheet) does the AF is digital too (another word page) or would it be better to have it written and keep the project shett digital ? What do you think about it ?</div>

<div class="content">Regarding your last question, It works every way Jupiter. The only question you need to solve is:<br>If you see Project X on your list, can you easily find X?  If you have a way to do this with Word ( but I wouldn't ), good enough. Or use notebooks, binders, folders, computer files. Store your project anyhow you choose, just so it's easy to find. <br><br>PS. Double beam? Do you mean 2 columns, or what?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jupiter - As Alan puts it, whatever allows a quick retrieval of your support papers. I've had so many "system" changes, I have lost count, but of late  I've settled into a mix of modes. My AF list is written while support documents, projects lists, checklists, drafts, research and the like are in OneNote. If the reference is to a paper file or document, its location or name is written on OneNote.<br><br>I guess that I aim to be nimble this way. Recycling the AF list on paper is easy and the standing out process is far more engaging for me on paper than on the screen.</div>

<div class="meta">2010-10-9 16:54</div>
<div class="content">Easy retrieval should be a key consideration. Another key consideration  should be flexibility.<br><br>Is paper or digital the most effective way you capture tasks as they come at you or as you think them up?<br><br>Your answer to that will probably be the mode that will be most useful for your AF list - paper or digital. Seraphim's helpful post here underlines the point about remaining flexible:<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2010/9/30/using-resistance-as-a-guide.html#comment10109694" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2010/9/30/using-resistance-as-a-guide.html#comment10109694</a> <br><br>Mark makes similar references - whatever gets the job done.<br><br>So Jupiter, perhaps that might help you decide whether your AF list is on paper or digital.</div>

<div class="content">Thank you so much. <br>@alan double beam is for me a task reentered a few time . I often do that 3, 4, 5 time on 20 pages. May be it's an obsession. <br><br>Now there is a little light that make me understand. I used AF as a list where I put everything details like big projects or ideas about things. When there was only but a few page it never was a problem. But now that there are many pages it becomes one. Also i need to follow some strategic projects wich need to do things one after the others and putting these tasks in any order was a problem to follow and decide the next step even if AF is really a fantastic system to make things happen. <br><br>Anyway I thought today about the way i am working. What I do and how i do it. <br>Finaly my work is simple. I dont have to work for hours in front of a computer what i need is talking to people and make business with them. I am also a lot outside. I need to follow what was said and I need to synchronize it on my macintosh<br><br>The choice of an ipad could be a great idea. It is like a note book , it is easy to carry. I can take notes during an appointment very easily. I can put photos and film about my buildings and show it to my clients, I can take notes about there needs, I can make selection about them with filemaker. And if i am more fortunate i can buy a software specialized in real estate which works on ipad and use AF like a paper note book. <br>I dont have one note and it doesn't work with the ipad. <br><br>So the solution could be an ipad and put everything on it. as I spend much of my time on the phone. Then as one notes can't be tested on mac and doesn't work with ipad what kind of software could I use to follow my stuff with AF and report things on projects. <br>I dont want to use Omnifocus I can't bear it anymore there are no enought notes and it is complicated. <br><br>* So I need an easy retriaval (clients, buildings, selection, notes, tasks....)<br>* So I need flexibility<br>* I need a simple system<br>* I need to do it very fast<br>* I wich i could go with one system paper or digital digital would be better <br>* I need to have security - the infos are confidential. <br><br>What do you think about it ? What software on my mac wich could work with the ipad, <br><br>Do you have any ideas ?</div>

<div class="content">One thing strikes me about most of the conversations here.<br>Sometimes, we try to chuck everything to 1 system hoping it will solve all our needs.<br>I don't believe there is such a thing...<br><br>Why?<br>Well, every system is designed to do one thing very well and that's why it works.<br><br>AF if a system to help you make decisions about what's important to you.<br>It helps with the flow of work and relieves procrastination to a very high degree.<br>All that at an "actionable" level.<br><br>It is NOT a documentation, nor a planning system.<br>But it is a very good system that engages your mental faculties,<br>your intuition and your feelings to choose what to tackle next.<br><br>So AF is a good springboard to decide which project or activity you will do next considering your present situation. Once you start on that next thing to do, you will probably need another system to let you know what has happened already about that and what's next...<br><br>If people want to master Life or Time management, they will need a few tools and knowledge. Think of AF as the motor in your car that will make things move. But you'll also need a map to know where you are going right? Does a master carpenter use a hammer to cut a piece of wood? No, he takes a saw... Same thing if you want to master the discipline of time management.<br><br>Sometimes, using the wrong tool can be detrimental...<br>Don't use a spoon to dig a trench and a shovel to eat your soup.<br>Both LOOK and ARE basically the same, but they are designed for different purposes!<br><br>@Jupiter<br>"Things" has and still is the best app for me regarding the agglomeration of tasks in projects. It syncs with Mac, iPad and iPhone.</div>

<div class="content">Hello All<br>I hardly worked on my organization this week end and tried to find what could be the easiest way to do things. Here are some of my thoughts and results. I again thanks all for yours advices and especially JD and Erik who helped me so much in different way in this thread.<br><br>1. About following my projects, after tying many softwares soho organizer, soho notes i organize things, omnifocus,  circus ponies note book Macjournal, page, and the incredible wiki vodoopadlite, I finally shose.. Evernote. Mainly because of his Easy retrieval and it sync with the ipad and the iphone. And it is free and powerfull and easy...<br><br>2. About my AF I realized as JD said that my AF list was complicated. Willing to put everything on it little by little was a mistake. My brain had difficulties to choose the right tasks at the right time and it increased so much that I could not do the work as it has to be done. I also realised that my most important project were indeed difficult to follow. Then, i did as JD said "1. If its part of a project, collating individual tasks into a separate project action list? That would help you become "project-centric" and allocate your big rocks into focused project action tasks"; The result is great. I can work on this major project and do the stuff it there is a first action i just report it on AF4<br><br>3. I just begin to do check list (JD point n°2)  and this morning was much better<br><br>The result is that now i loose less time to do things. And i acquired a better control. <br>I begin to report all projects on evernote which were already on files. This is very fast to do i think it will take me about an hour. <br><br>4. About doing things i put 2 lists on evernote on call AF4 professional AF4 and the other personal AF4. I kept the personal but i reported on my paper note book the stuff to do with references to projects ie WORK on project XXX 'which is on evernote). I have a much better control about my AF4 list because in my office the income stuff comes and go like a hurricane. <br><br>So thanks it's coming (i hope) little by little.  and you put me back on the rails ;-)<br><br>Spend a gook week !.</div>

<div class="content">sure I did !<br><br>Anyway i think these recommendation and others could go on a manual of instruction about using AF. This would be great. ie like the one about AF1 or may be do one with variance.<br><br>Because even reading 10 times the instruction I never really understand until now these points.<br>I guess I am not alone. I guess that for a beginner it would be worst too.  <br><br>Anyway i confirm. I have worked all day long on my paper AF list putting everything wich happened today (about a 100 of items- I told you I work in a hurricane of tasks LOL) and tonight I shall report all my mainly projects on Evernote. and keep, erase on AF what is reported and reformulate what must be. <br><br>I must admit that i could not do it during the day because of the incredible activity. I simply did nt have time to do it.</div>

<div class="content">One week ago I promised I shall come back to you to report my experiences about yours advices and how did it work for me this past week. <br><br>Well well marvelously. <br>Point 1 and to. <br>1. About following my projects with Evernote <br>2. About my AF I realized as JD said that my AF list was complicated. <br><br>> the following with EVERNOTE was just what i needed about my complicated projects. Writing just on AF4 Work on project X and goto the projects and task in evernote gave me a great control and a lot of efficiency. <br><br>3. I just begin to do check list<br>I did a great work this week and made many control and check list <br>there are one for my method, one for the morning, the day, the evening <br><br>4. About doing things i put 2 lists on evernote on call AF4 professional AF4 and the other personal AF4.  Finaly I kept the personal on evernote because I dont use it very much.<br>But the professional stayed on paoer on my A4 note book.  And it is perfect<br><br>5. I added some externalized list. As mark forster said Mark forster<br>"You use a separate list when you feel you need one. Would you use a shopping list when you go shopping? Would you use a packing list when you are packing for the holidays? Would you make up a call list, if you were calling prospective clients? Answer: you would if you felt you needed to. It's the same with any other project. "<br><br>Mine are @Wait, @Call, @Errands, @Read, @Mail  @Tickler <br>Yes it's is GTD. I realised I needed it when i was waiting something from other it was better to externalize it on my @Wait list on evernote because i could then add a date or todays date and I use it as a secont call list when i need it too.<br><br>So now I have my AF4 list on paper. <br>So I have my projects and some context list on EVERNOTE, checklist, control list, <br>So I have on my computer all my files. <br><br>I must admit it worked perfectly this past week <br>I just had to do a little review at night of my AF with my evening check list <br>and a little review in the morning at my arrival at my office with my morning checklist <br><br>Hope this will be of any help to others.</div>

<div class="content">That's awesome, Jupiter! Somebody interviewed a bunch of successful people once and asked them each what system they followed. There were many different answers, some quite distinctive. Only two constants were observed:<br><br>1. Nobody said just I use X (GTD, Covey, etc.). Their system was personal. <br>2. Their system was extremely useful for them.<br><br>Sounds like you have reached the same point.</div>

<div class="content">Jupiter - glad it's evolved for you to a point where you can feel a level of satisfaction with your system.<br><br>For me, AF has evolved into my intuitive guide and a compass. It helps where help is required - when and what to do at any particular instance. The repository of the work - project lists, checklists and the like are elsewhere - OneNote for quite a while and until recently Freemind scholar.<br><br>And that's the thing - whatever tool I employ to get my work done (recently, lots of project related work and Freemind keeps it all together), AF keeps me balanced, focused and right on the ball.</div>
