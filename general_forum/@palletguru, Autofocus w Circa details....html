<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-04-8 20:58</div>
<div class="content">palletguru,<br>Thanks for the pdf link and your explanations. I have been doing AF using a Moleskine. While I have had significant productivity improvement with AF, I still have difficulty in having a clear overall picture of where I stand at any given point. I have tried to replicate the environment in OneNote which has helped me somewhat. I feel that your comprehensive tagging process might help me and would like to give that a shot. <br><br>I have tried to piece together your process (at a basic level) by looking through your pictures (@flickr) and notes. But, if you could articulate in detail how you work your AF process, that would help me immensely. Apart from your tagging process, if you could shed some light on where do you keep your project related resources, how do you work your projects and tasks, how do you keep track of time sensitive items etc. that would be great. Thanks.<br><br>GC</div>

<div class="content">GC,<br><br>Here is a link to the Flickr series:<br><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/7925615@N07/sets/72157616471904224/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/7925615@N07/sets/72157616471904224/</a><br><br>My tagging process for tasks is mainly used to track series of tasks though the pages, as well as providing reference information for these tasks. After using Autofocus for a while, I found that the "little and often" approach resulted in a dramatic increase in my productivity. But since I work in a project-intensive environment with tons of discretionary time, I wanted a way to track how often I was working on a task series or project.<br><br>On the task sheet ( <a href="http://files.me.com/jeremy.benz/z0p3vk" rel="nofollow">http://files.me.com/jeremy.benz/z0p3vk</a> ) the far left column is for the origination tag, expressed as a page number and a line letter. So, on Page 5 (after I've gone through every available task with no intention of doing it), Line B, I get to "Check News Feeds." It stands out to me, so I place my blue post-it arrow under it (like the "dot") and fire up Google Reader. <br><br>I pat myself on the back and mark the task complete with a "/" through the box, meaning that I intend to do this task again. In the area to the right of the box, I fill in the current date (just the day number if the current month is the same as the month the sheet was created on), and under that I put the destination tag - the next unfilled line of my last active page (lets say 10Q). I am able to flip between my current task and my last active page with the divider and post-it arrow.<br><br>I then flip to my last active page (Page 10), and fill in the origination tag with "5B" since that was the task that motivated the entry for this one. I then fill in "Check News Feeds" since I will be doing it again. Now, by following the origination tag, I can see the last time I performed that task, which allows the tracking of the task series. Basically, this links related tasks together. I do this whenever I reenter tasks, or move though the next actions of my projects.<br><br>This also works very well for projects, where you have a series of next actions that you can track through the pages. I have a basic project list in Evernote that I print and punch whenever changes are made which Includes the Project number, Title, and the start tag where the first action of the project is listed. When the project is completed, I enter the tag for the final task and move the whole string to my Completed Projects List. <br><br>I use the second column from the left to include reference tags like project number, email, paper file location, etc. These tags exist as reference items for the task: where to get information to help me complete it. They are not contexts (like @fax): I feel contexts detract from the "standing out" portion of task selection that makes Mark's system so revolutionary.<br><br>The back of a page is reserved for notes associated with the task, 90% of the time, they are notes that I write down during task execution or after the completion of it. The presence of digital notes is captured in Evernote, which supports tags and fits well within the system (I can drop 5B into Evernote to look at the news I clipped into it as a result of the task I completed, for example).<br><br>For me, Autofocus does great job of sifting time-sensitive items. I have a tickler file for paper items (43 folders) and my iCal for electronic items. Most often, I will schedule a time sensitive item to hit my AF notebook a week before it is due (I usually can run through 3-5 cycles of my active pages in a week). Following Mark's suggestion of using a 3x5 card as a bookmark to hold urgent items that must be completed that day, I use a Levenger Tasker Sheet, which serves the same purpose, but is "circa friendly."<br><br>That's how I currently do things with Autofocus. I realize the tagging takes more time and detracts from the system's elegant simplicity, but I feel I get more out of the bargain in the ability to easily track what I am doing. I could just as easily throw the Circa into the bottom of drawer and go back to my Moleskine (or go 100% digital with Andreas's autofocus.cc ) if this tagging business gets too complicated. ;-)<br></div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the comprehensive summary of your process. I am going to adopt a few of them (few tags) and go from there. Thanks once again.<br><br>GC</div>

<div class="content">Hi palletguru<br><br>Whilst I don't like adding tags to my notebook AF (although use them in my digital version) I like your idea of cross referencing by means of the A-Z line notation.  It reminds me for some reason of a Time Management system I used over 20 years ago called A-Time where you numbered your projects and then any page related to that project was sub referenced (eg 1, (i), (iv) etc.  which sounds more complicated than it was) so that you could keep track of related stuff whilst adding to the system in a freeform way.</div>

<div class="content">Christine B,<br><br>I agree the reference tags clutter up the task lines a bit. The tracking ability continues to work well (area to the left of the task points to the preceeding task, the area to the right points to the next one). This really helps Autofocus coexist with a number of project management tools. <br><br>A-Time sounds great. I suppose I could flip back to my project page and include the line for each task as I create it to associate it with the specific project. As of now, I just include the starting task (which points to the next consecutive task and so on), and the final task when the project is complete.<br><br>I also scan each page into Evernote when it is completed. Too bad my handwriting is so aweful that the text recognition garbles most of it. Hopefully in future versions the handwriting recognition will get better - my handwriting certainly won't!</div>

<div class="content">Strangely my handwriting has improved since starting AF - but I notice it get's worse when my pen starts to run out of ink - have gotten through a number of pens since starting AF!  Check out the links in the following thread - I found them really helpful<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/623459" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/623459</a><br><br></div>
