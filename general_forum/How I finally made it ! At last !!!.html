<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2017-02-24 19:12</div>
<div class="content">Hi all  ! <br><br>A year ago I spoke about the incredible method of Jane Westman.<br><br>As she said « I've never understood the value of a complicated time-management system. I tried one once -- the kind with a loose-leaf binder with a dozen sections for different types of information. With that system, I had to spend so much time prioritizing my to-do list and deciding where things should go that I could barely focus on running my company! »<br><br>« Instead, I stick to a time-management method that's simple but effective. It's ideal if your day -- like mine and so many other entrepreneurs' -- is full of multiple projects and details. My method works so well in my company, which specializes in book and author publicity, that I now insist that most of my employees use it. The system helps them do their jobs, and it helps me keep track of their work and my business. Best of all, anyone can use it »<br><br>Why Mark Forster and Jane Westman list are incredibly efficient for me ? I dont know. As a deal maker I tried many systems to improve my efficiency. <br><br>The best I found was GTD. But it has for me an un acceptable consequence. I spend more time organizing my stuff than acting. The results were terrible in my jobs because I have increased a lot my capacities of doing any thing else than business… I was to obstinate.I lost a lot of deals. Sometime anyway I had some good results, but at what price ? I red ten times the method. Use tons of software (the best was omnifocus)and Tried to do my best to do it correctly. I also Used coach to explain it to me. <br><br>Finally my results were poor. I realized What amount of energy and time spent for nothing ! At night I was exhausted… I my mind was far away unlike water… <br><br>So I wondered why and tried as you did Mark Forster methods. Quiet all. I understood the stand out principle.  The results was then totally different. They depends on methods. The best was AF1 and AF4. I never stick to FV. But instead I Increased considerably my efficiency. The results were there. But sometime lists became so huge that I could not manage anything seriously.. So I felt again bad. I had to clean the list and I spent a long time doing that… But I learned a lot and I still learn of yours posts and MF tests...<br><br>Finally I discovered Jane Westman method. The system is very near AF systems : Here is the method www.inc.com/magazine/19960901/1807.html but there is an incredibly efficiency and simplicity in the way she does it. <br><br>After years and years of mistakes, tried, fails, some success too also ;-) w I made my own system. I took the best of systems and applied it carefully. And I am happy to share it with you.<br><br>The basic principle was that the system had to care by itself. Easily. <br><br>(So I use Jane Westman method. It is near AF except that you put only tasks and commitments. It is near GTD by the 5 principle. So this are the rule.<br><br>(1)  You put all yours engagements and task personal and professional. You use GTD for collecting them is a special note book and write anything. No computer. It is crucial. If you are outside you reports your tasks of a carnet directly in the system. Your note book never leave your office. <br>(2) Each day at night you cross the list and date tomorrow list. <br>(3) During the day you put every tasks and commitment. Don’t care the system will clean it by itself. <br>If you work on a project just dot all tasks relatives it on your list. If finished cross it. If still available ut goes at the end of he list. You cab read the list backward or forward. The best is doing alternatively. But do it as you feel. <br>(4) Once a week on Wednesday start a fresh list and report all what you really intend to do. All what is before the new list is dismissed. Crossed all what is reported let the rest it will be a someday may be list. You can include a goal weekly list in a different color. It will remind you the core aims you have to do during the week. <br><br>That's all folks ! <br><br>What is incredible is that the system is hardly stuck to action. No procrastination with me. It goes fast and easy. The weekly review is incredibly fast. <br><br>It let you time for working on some projects. Use a paper folder.Write things, put documents. Plan these projects on a simple word on your diary in the future and the reference to find it fast. Tasks can be either on the project either on the list. Never mind when you will work your mind will tell you the next action and your strategy will be written in your paper folder. <br><br>As said jane Westman « With this system, I don't waste time writing a new list every day » I am indeed efficient (at last) it works perfectly with me. I find all I need to complete my stuff in references either in my paper folder or on my computer. This past week was one of the most productive of my life. I wanted to share this success with you. <br><br>Kind regards.</div>

<div class="content">Thank You Mark. I must say that the goods results I have is also due to your forum and your tests. Yours methods has inspired me. So thank you ! Thank you for having invented the serial AF and especially AF1 and AF2. <br><br> I accept the lent challenge. I will stay focus in this method, With 3 precisions :<br><br>1. If the method I am testing since 20 days does not work, or reveal a real trouble with makes things impossible or blocks my creativity, I will stop the test, because it would make my company in danger. Methods are crucial in business. Then I will be back to you. <br>2. I keep gtd principle i.e. the 5 golden principle Collect, process, organize, review, do and references folders except that I will act one by one on my list and folders for projects paper if they are hot, and computer if not. a classic and backward reading and stand out principle (your principle)<br>3. I am free not to use the way Jane Westman choose the items before she acts i.e. she "numbers them" from 1 to 5. I am no easy with this. 3 is better for the moment. But dots may be better than numbers... If I go to 5 I will but for now it does not work to 5. <br><br>SO OK let's begin now ! I will come back to you on april 17 th (not the 15 th) it is a good idea.</div>

<div class="meta">2017-02-25 10:39</div>
<div class="content">Ok. Let's say I start with you on the 1st of march but anyway I will use it until then <br><br>I forgot a few important things. <br><br>(1) As you understand all it is a hand written method. I noticed it makes a real difference with a digital. Info are always here. So your brain appropriates it. The consequence is visualisation. I noticed someday I just have to make a quick read (cf AF1 methods) first to start and use the "stand out way" in a second pass. What is incredible is that all the crucial things stands. There is no dispersion. I have the real and deep feeling that my brain takes control. Gtd never did that. Sometime I felt like working like a robot. The result is that I feel involved in the situation. I am on the "here and now" not on the future. Also as the tasks a mixtedmy brain has to be aware. This awareness is for anything. I felt I improve my lessoning capacities about what others says and the method considerably revealed my intuition. This is a crucial difference about gtd's effects on me. GTD had tendencies to the oposit. Sometime I felt like I was sleeping. On another hand the method needs to make little pauses to relax for preserving my energy. <br><br>(2) Jane préconises to use only but one note book. She takes note on the left page and she use the right one for tasks and commitments. I don't. <br><br>Doing that caused me a lot of trouble. I had to make a "Table of Contents" and this was complicated. Also making a real scission between tasks and notes makes reporting and collecting, clarification, easier. I only have to put my yellow A4 note book use for notes on the left, my green school 17 X22 clairfontaine Note book on the right and reports. It is very quick. It can take 10 mn for 10 pages...<br><br>As I love journaling I also use :  a diary (red) agenda quo vadis, were I quickly report all what happens. it is a kind of business and organizational reporting. It helps me to review my stuff and what happened on the past week. I fount it easier for controlling what happened and fixing goals in the future. I like it to be different than my notes about subjects on my yellow note book.  <br><br>At last I use a A5 RHODIA fr objectives and good habits it is a kind of mixt organizational project and goal oriented tool. It is a kind of inbox. For example if I have an idea about a current initiative in the future it goes here. Idem for a goal. I will review this at a specific time extracts and report what is worth to do,  in my others list (check lists, complicated projects on my computer) <br><br>All that is simple and easy. But the core of the system is my green (tasks and commitments) and yellow (notes) notebook. They are the heart of it. I feel the yellow like an extension of my memory i.e. numbers about my business. The green is my acting system. <br><br>One more thing. Every information on every note book (except diary) is crossed if it is obsolete. <br>That's also the heart of it. It makes me focus on only but what is indeed crucial for me, for now or for the future.</div>

<div class="content">Jupiter wrote: "The best I found was GTD. But it has for me an un acceptable consequence. I spend more time organizing my stuff than acting."<br><br>Though, to be fair to GTD, the system's primary focus - though it isn't always emphasized enough - is on creating "clear space" in your mind from where you can then make solid intuitive choices about what to do next, even if the next thing you decide to do isn't even on your GTD lists at all.</div>

<div class="content">@ Frank Hi. Thanks for the comments. I agree. But with me the next action never works (even well formulated) and more it never "clear space" in my head. There was always something unclear even  if I did regular reviews (I spent 10 hours doing one !) . JW method or MF methods are really better for me. I can really trust the system. <br><br>To be honest I am not "against" GTD. GTD is for me a collection of habits. A fantastic tool for organizing stuff and clarifying your goals. But it is not a real acting system nor a method. Gtd is perfect for people who are in an organizational process i.e. working in a big company or so (as I did). <br><br>MF and JW method or mine is a business processing method. The purpose is not organizing stuff. The purpose is to collect stuff and decide what will give you the best result for now according to your real aims at a specific time. <br><br>I have met a dozen of business maker and people. I never met anyone who used everything of GTD. It is too complicated. The method has a great success because of the stressful days and the complication of our new world. It is a reassuring process for stressful people. On another hand the core principle are right. And for me life is only principle (laws) <br><br>All is of course depending on the way your brain works. If your are more on "action" than on a "thinking, organizational process" GTD is wrong. JW or MF are much better. If you consider people who made these methods you will see that Mark was a soldier, and Jane is a business maker even she drives a company specialized in books and authors. About me I am a business maker specialized in corporate Realestate investments. <br><br>Happily everything exists. GTD is great for some. MF and JW methods or others are better for others.</div>

<div class="content">I don't get this at all. I don't see how Ms. Wesman's system handles anything well but the latest and loudest. Can somebody explain in more detail?</div>

<div class="meta">2017-02-25 20:35</div>
<div class="content">If I understand you question well you mean How a list can handle anything ? How can I compare list and GTD method with direct all relatives tasks in inboxes and is a global method ? Is that right ? <br><br>It is difficult to explain, but I gonna try. For this you must have used GTD and Lists.  <br><br>(1) GTD has one principle. Every action, every goal, every thing must go in global process in 5 steps which leads it in a kind of inbox where all similar items are grouped. DA says if everything is clarified then you will have mind like water. Everything will be clear than you will choose what to do according to 4 criterias. <br><br>(2) AF, JW has the same principle of identification of tasks. Except that doing all the stuff of organizing all that the list does it by itself because each task is relative to a subject. So effectively all urgencies are mostly at the end of the list. <br><br>The difference between the 2 method is about acting and doing. In gtd you use contexts so all will be grouped by the same one for example @Phone you will make all your call one after the other. <br>With AF systems or JW you have sometime similar approach sometime different ones. <br><br>In my way if I work on a project I will search in the list all relative tasks. I also will go to the project to see if there is something to do first which will make the difference. Then I will do my first action as in GTD. But I will stay focus on my goal until there is nothing else I can do. Then I will read the list and do what I feel is better doing at the present time.  I can also decide to number as JW said my 3 items, goals of the day or only one. And stay focus on it. I can also decide to make all my call relatives to my prospection or closing deals. The system is indeed flexible. As I am intuitive it is better for me than a very structured method. AF and JW are not about rationally. They are about acting (both are acting systems) and intuition (intuition has no explanation, intuition is or isn't) <br><br>What I meant about method is not a serial of processes. What I meant is about feeling stuff to do. I really can explain more. It is a question of feeling and engagement in the action. <br><br>What was the most difficult to understand for me in MF methods (or JW) was the principle of trusting the system. I could not believe that a simple list with contains everything in a huge melting post can be efficient in action. I was educated in a rational way. I may say nearly mathematical approach. On my post mid age (I am 55) I realized doing meditation and sophrology that I had as everyone intuition. The start of it in methods was when I discovered AF1 and the stand out system MF has invented. For years I wondered why an item can stand out. Until I realized that there was nothing to understand. An item stand at you because it has to.<br><br>So With GTD I thought rationaly and thought that GTD by the identification and grouping actions, was more able to deal with the huge amount of work I have / had everyday as a business maker. <br><br>I was wrong. MF and JW Methods are indeed powerful for acting. For me they are better than GTD because they gives the relay to my brain who is in contact with my intuition and who tell me the best to do at the right time. It looks me years to understand this.</div>

<div class="content">Last update I may have found the last problem I had with the list i.e. choosing the right thing to do. <br>JW preconize to number the items? Something is unclear. Sure the tasks of the day has to be numbered but what about the old tasks ? I guess the have to be. <br><br>I found something in 2 steps. Here is the rule for choosing <br>Use the stand out system (AF1) <br>(1) Begin by the end of the list = like AF2 and go backward <br>(2) Star all items you intend to do very soon (for me the day) <br>(3) Number the stars from 1 to 3 beginning by the most urgent stuff <br><br>I noticed urgencies are treated first. Then all what s important. <br>Hope it will work. I test until the 28 th then on the first I stick to what i found</div>

<div class="content">When yours 3 tasks are numbered you may be about one on a project. Go as far as you can go on this project. Get all the tasks relative to it. Use your intuition to choise the first thing to do. Be full implicated on what you do for now. <br><br>Dont hesitate to ask me others explanation if something is unclear or you need tobknow some more. I will be happy to help.</div>

<div class="content">My default system is similar to that.<br><br>The biggest difference is that I copy today's top priorities to today's page, rather than highlight them in place.<br><br>Example (fictional):<br><br>Yesterday was a slow day. Nothing urgent. Top five for the day were maintenance and system improvements, and I did three. That left two highlighted. Today's morning mail brought five urgent and very important projects. <br><br>If I read it right, Wesman would have seven highlighted. In my system, there are only five on today's page.<br><br>I usually copy more than five to today's page, so I have a variety to choose from. When I try writing just the few I want to commit to, it doesn't work. Most of my projects are equal priority. Picking the specific one too early creates resistance, for me. I once dreamed of a shorter list I'd definitely do, as in DIT, but when the moment came to do the planned task, I stalled. A few more choice and pick by mood or randomizer works better. It's still a short list, though, only about 10 lines, much shorter than my catch-all.</div>

<div class="content">@Cricket / The idea is brillant ! I did it this morning and reported in red the most important projects I had to do today. I began with 3 and finished now 14 pm at 5 This simple habit forced me to focus on one thing only and it was better for acting. Thanks ! <br><br>I just report bytheway my lent engagement. I still work with the system since the 1rst and everuthing is allright. Only one exception the activity was so hard and overwhelmng that I had to report all my projects like gtd does and a wf list. Of course I erased the idems in the list wich de clutered straight away. <br><br>The all methods as I explained it previously is still working like a charm...</div>

<div class="content">Sunday march 12th-12 days since lent challenge. My system still worksperfectly. I tried for a few hours flexible af wich is near jane's method. The result was good but with no significative effects on my work. My system becomes essential littke by little. No colors, no context, no timing, no tips... just the list wich is dated day per day with items crossed as MF explainzd with AF1<br><br>I have no real difficulties about procrastination or doing things. I may say I am busy but am I efficient ? Merely yes. But my strugle is about my big rocks and goals ie the vision about my company, what I wang to do to make it better, how I can do it. So I decided to read again MF last book about this and try to plan, do and control my goals and projects. <br><br>I will report here how it evoluate. One thing is sure. It will be on the principle os SIMPLICITY.</div>

<div class="content">Hello all ! My little weekly report done on wednesday instead of sunday. Yes ! I am ahead !!!<br><br>The past 11th /52 week was very exhausting. I had 5 very hard day full of commitments and actions. Many incoming informations. Many things to do and projects to complete. On tuesday it was so hard that I tried to use michael linenberger method. <a href="http://www.michaellinenberger.com/TheOneMinuteTo-DoList-Ebook.pdf" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.michaellinenberger.com/TheOneMinuteTo-DoList-Ebook.pdf</a> included and not included in my list. But I failed. So I decided to stick at my method and the list did it well. I applied strictly jane's method and I succeded. <br><br>Anyway I found an idea ie making some control list and a new project's list dived in 3 columns<br>one for project I haven't started yet, one for those which began, one for those which are finished. <br>I applied this idea with others list and it was again a success. <br><br>My list is still the best tool I have. I am still in the course. I dont follow any system for reading it. I just read it backward and forward (in any senses) cross, report and add items. I focus on acting. I do everything I can to close all incoming information on during the day it happens if it is worth to do it. <br><br>My system is beginning very simple. I am surprised of the core things I did. Globally I dont do anything but what I do is what I had to do. <br><br>I feel the system like a factory. A process which take stuff little by little and do it conscientiously. <br><br>I am waiting impatiently for the results now ! Sur they will soon com. I hardly wish them. <br><br>Kind regards.</div>

<div class="content">I tried something interesting today. I noticed as I dated each day (as today) that my list was huge. it is 17 pm and I have 47 things on my list... Jane's system with numbering was difficult to manage. The trouble was also that it had to be added with my previous days (ie all the things I did not do) <br>So happens at a certain time a crucial question : What do I do next ? I felt a bit overwhelmed. <br><br>Then I remembered AF1 and DIT and crossed in the middle of the page my item which where the divided in 2. The old list (what I planned yesterday night and this morning first) and the new list. I then began to treat it as I treated AF1. I did all I could on the old list, crossed, erased planned, do and report each items little by little by the stand out system until nothing was possible to do. Then I reported all unfinished items and new one after the midle crossed line. <br><br>When everything on the first list was done I began the secont list and did it as well<br><br>The result was very good. I crossed 15 item / 47 ie 31% and they were the most important of the day. I am still late on 2 crucial projects but the day is not finished. If I have some energy I gona try to finish them.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jupiter, interested in why linenberger method did not work for you. Let me know.<br>That seems quite a good one to deal with urgent tasks. I suffer from having too much to do hence I struggled with DIT as I am always pulled into clearing urgent backlog tasks.<br>Thanks</div>

<div class="content">I Alexg<br><br>Michael Linenberger is the best system I ever found. It can easely be added to the system. Ie create apart an over the horizon list... <br><br>I realize something strange I dont really understand. The simpliest the list is (ie without colors and so on) the most efficient the list is. I think it is due to the fact that each day I start with a fresh list. <br><br>I always put too many things on this list. At the end of the day I notice I did half of it or so...<br><br>Then the next day I feel guilty. There are some crucial engagement which are repeated again and again. I feel very reluctant to do them. I decided to plan the most important one and try to do my best to do it at this time. But sometime I am simply un able. The perfect example is my list of building. I know I have to do it. But I dont feel it. I just cant. It is like this since 2 weeks. I am just un able to do it until one day I will do it on one batch (which in this example will be half a day) <br><br>There is another effect of the list I have tried to explain before. My brain feel comfortable with the idea of having lists like GTD. I perfectly know the method. But I just cant. When these list are organised the result is a total uncapacity to do things. I dont understand why. <br><br>I feel much comfortable and much efficient when I have nothing but a messy dated day per day list crossed, reported and so on... Then I dont think about anything I just do things as I feel to do them. And then there is no uncapacity or procrastination. <br><br>Please Dont ask me why. May be it is only but the way my brain likes it to be. Anyway my brain also like mind map for clafying situation or projects. May be the solution is around this deux principles...</div>

<div class="content">Oh yes I get that too! The brakes go firmly on various tasks. I know I must do the task, but it just seems impossible to get started...how odd. <br>I have been searching for a system to minimise the problem. DIT is great for that, but I have got a huge backlog as well. I can never clear the new work coming in as I'm always pulled into working urgent tasks in the backlog. Dilemma..<br>I guess the procrastinators of the world with a huge backlog need a system that solves the problem.<br>No idea what to do - probably just carry on fighting fires and work on taking on less commitments as that really is the only long term solution as per DIT instructions.<br>If I'm procrastinating a lot, the only thing that seems to help is not to review a task at all. Instead, I just make a commitment to deal with any task to a completion. Just work on oldest task first.

<div class="content">Lent : still in the course ! yeah weekly update of my system. The past week was indeed hot. I must admit that I was a bit wondering if a single list like AF list would really work. As I explained GTD was more comfortable, "mindly" of course. Anyway not only my system till works but the result astonish me every day... <br><br>Here are the results. <br>- Excellent control of task and projects<br>- Motivation at the top <br>- Very little procrastination<br>- Very good choice abut tasks which are equal to my mind goals and crucial stuff to do<br>- Someday may be task left in the system so they can be review and the chosen or eliminated. <br>- Some little mind blockage about some project, thanks to Mark i understood why ! Thank you Mark ! <br>- A special effect on my brain and mind which changed everything. I am not sure exactlt to explain it but the result is like if my mind took the power. Before I was guided by the system, the computer (omnifocus) I spent a lot of time structuring and organizing stuff instead of doing<br><br>Today I just focus on action, I feel much engaged in things. I am more aware and intuitive. <br>The lent challenge forced me on focusing on one method only to give a 100 % on what I do. <br>It is great ! <br><br>I realised the core of my method is in the weekly review. I do it simply crossing and reporting what must be. Following anything in the same list. Dating each day conscienciouly so I can see all relatives items about one day. <br><br>The other core process is about some external list ie projects, results, clients, and when it will possible buildings, focus on on thing only, note every task, take notes on a dedicated note book when ther e is nothing but notes. One page per subject if possible. <br><br>the core secret is act act and act. Do all I can possibly do the same day the information arrives in my system. <br><br>Another on is treating the list day per day first and then read it backward (as AF2). If the reading is hard go forward. I noticed there is a better sens of urgencies<br><br>At last I take a little time each day to notice the 2 or 3 project I must focus on today and star all urgencies<br><br>That's all folks ! <br><br>My system become truly efficient.

It's easier to look through my book when I'm ready to start calling" I found a solution about this. <br><br>For explaining it I need to explain how is structured my list a little bit. <br>I use a school green Clairfontaine note book like this : <a href="http://www.bureau-vallee.fr/192p-cah-broche-17x22-seyes-cl-76195.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.bureau-vallee.fr/192p-cah-broche-17x22-seyes-cl-76195.html</a><br><br>My list has 2 margins (I add) one on the left, one on the right of the page<br><br>each page is numbered<br><br>Here is the method<br>1. Each day date today's page (Jane wesman) <br>2. Report all items one by one. D'ont bother about what you write. Also Write for example may be I could... Don't care the system will treat information later. (JW + MF) <br>3. Read again the list put on the left marge only but context or start date (if you intend to do it really. Put on the right marge only but the deadline of it <br>4. Put each project in [XXX] <br><br>Now let's act !<br>Imagine you have to work on project X<br>1. Review the all list <br>2. Dot each item relative to project X in [XXX] <br>3. Act, act and act <br>The project is over. OK There is still something to do later ? Report at the end of the list. (MF) <br>The item or the project is not relevant ? Cross it . You are waiting something from someone ? Write the item, the name of the people put WF on the left margin. It is for next Tuesday > put next Tuesday 28 th in the right marge. <br><br>So now you have finished yours task about project x but you need to treat your emails <br>1. Dot all item marked as @ in the left margin<br>2. Treat them as a batch <br>3. Go as fast as possible and how far you can <br>The emails are treated. <br><br>So now you decide to treat your call <br>1. read the all list <br>2. Do all items which are @call is the left margin<br>3. act, act, and act <br>You left a message  ? Report the subject at the end of the list (MF) and if there is a dead line ONLY put it on the right marge<br><br>Now all items must be crossed when they are treated <br>You can add a date of treatment if it is good for you <br>You can at a specific moment report all items in today from previous day to have all relatives items such as project or context on the same page<br>Report on your diary dead lines and date of control<br><br>The results will be <br>a short list<br>Non actionable items in the previous days <br>Only but really hot items on the same or very previous days<br>A good operational agenda with only but crucial items like in GTD <br><br>Simple but efficient.</div>

<div class="content">@Cricket @Dino<br>Hi ! Hope you are all right. <br>"you use the left margin for project, context, and status" Not exactly. I use left margin for start date, context 'waiting for, call, work...)

Then by exception cross and report them all together. <br><br>"I still do not understand: How do you treat old pages (yesterday and everything before)?<br>Do you Transfer everything to todays list?" No I let them in the system until it become un manageable. Then as Jane wesman I declare a backlog. All before becomes dissmissed as in AF1. except that all active tasks are crossed and reported at the end of the list. There is only one exception. For example this morning I had to work about a project wich is buy a mini. There was many tasks on different days and not really organised. I could do a report in the right order or a heuristic scheme. I decided a report and did it all as a batch. There was call, emails, reviews, reading, calculation and so on...<br><br>Each item which remains in the system are non actionable items or future items. I will review the all list during my weekly review. <br><br>"Do you find it annoying having dots from this morning's project still in the book, or is it easy enough to erase them?" No there are no dots in my book as I am supposed to have treated all items about these dots</div>

<div class="content">Saturday april 1st. Here is my weekly check point. My system still works perfectly. I can't compare to my sunday's last review for the week was globally quiet except at certain times.  <br><br>I planned to make a process of my method but I realize it will take a little time and It is still in evolution. <br><br>So I will hold this review for the moment until The process is clear and ready. The basic principle are in this thread so if you wish it you just have to copy and past the basic principle and i guess it will work efficiently. <br><br>Today I am more focus and the psychological effect of my system. I am still surprised about how my system eliminates anxiety and goes straight to what is the most important. It has still a deep effect on my creativity and pro activity. Compare to gtd (context's list) there is a mesurable result. <br><br>I did yesterday my weekly review. It is a classical GTD review. Except that It tooks me 30 mn instead of 3 hours !!!. I simply crossed à line at the end of the day as usual, dated today (Saturday) realized that there was still 10 pages with items. Declared a backlog in my mind. Reported ans crossed available items reading backward and day per day all items, put deadlines and some events (such as date I sent some proposal to my clients if it was undone...) put also some planification (re call about a proposal...) or start date for some crucial project. I did it on my paper diary. Reading at the computer was to annoying. <br><br>I have still to report some others items action on emails still to do and so on... <br><br>I have a perfect and updated list of project divided in 3  - What is hot, projects I need to make progress about and global list of project I can start someday or anyway.<br><br>My system is simple and still based on nothing but paper. I understand what Jane wesman says when she said that she report in a project folder items relative to them. I do it so. Then When I work on a project it is easier to do it. I dont care about letting or not the item in my notebook as it will be eliminated by my system <br><br>Now I have only 3 pages of available items (instead of 10) It is easier to do. I Noticed my notebook has 46 pages of dated item crossed and closed. I had 12 hot projects (A) and no remains only 6 - 2 I can't do anything at all except waiting for the closing. I also had 18 project I have to make progress on (B). remains 16. The rest is only 20 uncrossed projects kept here for the future. <br><br>About my paper diary I have 2  crucial things to do. And 1 may be if I have some times. They are reported as "big rocks" <br><br>As you see the system is getting a right shape. Recently I read my GTD methodological guide (5 pages sold by david allen company with an executive summary of the method. I encourage people to buy them. They are very clear (a real challenge about GTD which is one of the most complicated system I ever met !) I noticed I can take some little tips to improve my efficiency. But I wont be back to the system. Mine is much better for me. <br><br>Good week end to all.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jupiter,<br>your system is very interesting. I just have one question - I think somebody asked it already, but I did not understand fully your response. When you want to work on a project, you dot all the tasks of that project in the list. Now lets imagine you have only time to do one or two tasks and then you have to switch your focus to other tasks. What do you do with the rest of dotted project tasks? You cross the dots? You rewrite the task at the end of the list? Thanks a lot for clarification.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Daneb ! <br>About projects - There are many cases. First my goal is to treat the all project and go as far I can...<br>When I read the list (which is alway short ie <= 4 pages) I dot only but actionable items. I also do brain storming about he project. At last if it is a project which needs a real work (for example a negociation) I have a paper folder full of notes and sometime tasks. So I report them on my list.  <br>Then I prioritize (JW) from 1 to 5. I take the first crucial thing and do it, then the secont until the end. If I am at the end of the five I renumber again and do it. Until there is nothing else I can do. <br><br>There can be an exception. A few days ago I had a complicated project which needed a heuristic scheme. So I did it instead of writing things. Then I reported all the tasks on the branches and focus on the project. I spent the afternoon but it was finished. It was the project of the day. <br><br>My advice is then to be creative and pro active. Focus on your goal instead of the task. The purpose is to win the battle not to be lose about details. <br><br>Hope hat's help<br><br>Nb. I could do this method on things, taskpaper 3, evernote, omnifocus even word or exel but I wont. When I take my ruler and go one item by one item backward or forward there is a special feeling. A kind of deep focus. I am sure the all buiding could collapse I would stick on what I am focus about.

I just report it at the end of the list. Idem for an idea. <br><br>As I said in here I dont care if the task is actionable or not, If it will be or not. If it needs planification or not. The system during a review will clear all that by itself. There will be more written paper that's all.</div>

I was a bit sad because they were my companion for years... I dont kow why but I opened a taskpaper page and reported my tasks as michael linnenberger did in the one minute to do list. The purpose was to get all my calls a a glance, find a project taping his name in the search bar and follow my stuff in the future. I had about 30 items. So I tried this morning to work on that list instead of my messy little list on my paper notebook. So guess ! I was completely stuck !!! So I simply reported the new items in my paper note book and did as usual. Then the engine gone faster and faster and my mind was perfectly opened and clear.

<div class="content">Hello Difficult to say if I succeeded the Lent Challenge as I was on holidays since 15 days. <br>If the challenge was to build and stick on a method. It is yes. The system worked and was efficient. So I built a method and a paper approach which was successful. <br><br>On an other hand it is No because I realized that using only but paper made me loose  lot of time  and was complicated about projects. So since 15 days I tried during my hollidays to but it digital with omnifocus. The reason of choosing this software is my perfect knowledge of it. But it also forced me to make it a little differently. <br><br>So Now I am at my office and I feel comfortable with the digital approach. But it is so new that I dont know if I will succeed that way. I mean what about my intuition ? Will it take more time or no ? <br><br>I want to give a try about One week just to understand and control my system. I think it is possible to make it. The basic idea is creating a perspectif classified by creation date.<br><br>Doing that with OF has many advantages. Ie keeping an actualised list of projects classified by domain of responsibilities and a list of context like GTD does. But also working as I did with my new perspective ie from the new items to the oldest. <br><br>As you see I am trying to find a way of the best two worlds and it is not easy !</div>

<div class="content">Jupiter, if your intuition and the digital approach disagree, that becomes an area to question. What does your intuition know that the digital approach ignores? Can you improve the digital approach to fix this? Or, looking in the other direction, what does the digital approach show that your intuition ignores?<br><br>My intuition is smarter about some things, and my formal systems are smarter about others. (Unfortunately, there are some things neither of them is smart about. The perfect system, of course, won't have that problem.)</div>

<div class="content">Day 2 - I applied my system to Omnifocus. It has 2 advanges. <br>1. Easy collect search and following of stuff classified by projects and area<br>2. Easy acting thanks to the creation date perspective. It has the same effect than with paper <br>It has also some di advantage. It force me to work with my computer. But iPhone is better for acting. @ Cricket Thanks for the intuition I gone think about this.

<div class="content">Hi Donald and all. My system evoluates little by little and it works very well. I will explain it later may be in another thread because this one is becoming longuer and longuer. To be short I now have all my project on omnifocus wich are grouped by area (Business, communication, healph and so on- 9 areas...) I use omnifocus for collecting everything and put it in the right place. For acting I often use my perspective "sort by creation date" wich makes a list by tasks by creation date such as it was on my paper note book. At then end of the day i use my done  tasks perspectives which shows all which was created sort by crossed (ie achieved) . I use it like a warehouse of projects and tasks and also as a plan book (each task or project can be planned at a certain time and goes on the forecast perspective. <br><br>But I also use my paper note book each day as a kind of close list (daily plan) which has 3 goals for the day (max) and a serial of tasks reported from omnifocus, from projects and the forecast perspective. <br><br>The result is a kind of close list were I have nothing but what I did and what is actionable<br><br>I also have some horizon list ie life plans, annual plans, quarter plan, monthly plan. <br><br>My system is becoming more and more efficient. My goal is now to make it simple and use the rules I have explained before to make it easier. <br><br>Comparing to the all paper system it is a clearest system. I dont get the paper mess I had before and it is faster. But my system is still fragile. It needs again some improovements. But I am convainced of one thing I will succeed.</div>
