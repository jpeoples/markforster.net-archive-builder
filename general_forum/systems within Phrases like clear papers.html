<div class="content">Mark (and others0,<br><br>I've read all of Mark's books and know that "clear papers" is a term<br>that means/meant that he would clear his desk and tidy up papers<br>from the various work tasks he had been doing.  Correct me if I am<br>wrong.<br><br>My question:  In previous books you mentioned creating a task list of<br>basic things like: clear papers, organize mail, etc.<br><br>How are you handling that in AF?  Are you listing each individual item?<br><br>With 10 or more pages of material, do you find yourself missing on basics?<br>Or do you realize it needs to be done and skip pages to make it happen?<br>Or do you schedule "Maintenance tasks" to specific times of the days?<br><br>basically, the gist of the question:  what are the various ways you have <br>tried, including your current conclusion, on how to handle these items?<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Bob</div>

<div class="content">Bob:<br><br>I have a series of routine recurring items which simply get re-entered every time I take action on them. They include such things as:<br><br>Email<br>Paper<br>Voicemail<br>Tidy desk<br>Twitter<br>Facebook<br>etc. etc.<br><br>Generally speaking I won't split them down into individual items unless there is one so large that I want to deal with it separately. In that case I will enter it as a task in its own right. So for example in today's mail was my bank statement. I made a separate task of "Reconcile Bank Statement".<br><br>You will need to experiment to find the best way of doing these types of tasks for yourself.</div>

<div class="content">Bob<br><br>Some routine items just seem to get done so don't always get repeated on my list but tasks which need regular attention but tasks such as "check email" which may either have some resistance attached, or may be actioned too frequently are on my list. I actually make a point of including "check email" on each page (as well as readding when actioned).  <br><br>If I have a backlog of email I may action that within my "check email" task or may include a separate task "email backlog".  If an email needs actioning but I do not feel like doing it when I am actioning my "check email" task then I add it to my list and file it in an email folder called AutoFocus.</div>

<div class="content">Sorry for going off topic, but...<br><br>Am I the only one that's jealous that Mark gets to spend his time on Facebook, Twitter and this forum and it counts as work?!?  That's awesome!  <br><br>Note to self for future goal - establish a business where social networking is required. :-)<br></div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline:<br><br>Actually I don't spend that much time on any of them. I have all three as recurring tasks on Facebook and will not spend more than 15 minutes or so on any one visit. I use Facebook mainly socially and Twitter entirely professionally. I'd probably have had to spend a lot more time on this Forum if Christine hadn't usually answered everyone's questions before I'd even seen them!</div>

<div class="content">Funny that you should mention the use of social media.  I use twitter and facebook in similar ways to mail - I have friends that I need to keep in contact with on these services.  I am also a blogger, so I need to keep across those networks.<br><br>I am however, working on my PhD, so these things don't count as work.  But they are important to me, in terms of maintaining my wider medical network and keeping up to date with information as well as keeping in touch.  So putting them on my Autofocus lists has helped me spend 15 minutes or so doing those tasks once or twice a day.<br><br>Equally, I have a lot of other tasks that don't count as "work" but are relevant to my future plans (I am also training as a surgeon and have a big exam in a few years).  So Autofocus helps me work on tasks like study notes at this early stage, which otherwise would have been ignored.<br><br>For those who think it sounds like I do nothing, I have now managed to get more work done on my thesis in the last two weeks with autofocus than I did in the two months prior to that.  I am currently having my cake, and eating it too, just regularly and in small bite-sized portions.</div>
