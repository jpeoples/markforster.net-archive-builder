<div class="content">Mark Forster's "standing out" process for picking tasks uses the power of what is commonly called the "adaptive unconscious", which is "a series of mental processes that is able to affect judgement and decision making, but is out of reach of the conscious mind," as Wikipedia defines it (I know Wikipedia can be iffy most of the time but at first blush this definition sounds adequate).  I want to read more about this, I was hoping other people can point me to more sources.<br><br>Personally I first learn of this term years ago when I read Malcolm Gladwell's "Blink,"<br><br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Blink-Power-Thinking-Without-ebook/dp/B000PAAH3K" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Blink-Power-Thinking-Without-ebook/dp/B000PAAH3K</a><br><br>I do not have the copy right now but I do remember him saying that the adaptive unconscious both has advantages and disadvantages, and thus it would be good to determine when to use our "first blush" impressions on things and when to use our conscious minds.<br><br>I then recently came across this online article <br><br><a href="http://www.healthguidance.org/entry/16989/1/The-Adaptive-Unconscious--Is-Your-First-Decision-Your-Best-One.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthguidance.org/entry/16989/1/The-Adaptive-Unconscious--Is-Your-First-Decision-Your-Best-One.html</a><br><br>which gave such a general rule:<br><br>"As a rule, going with your snap decision is often a good alternative should you lack the ability or knowledge to make a reasoned decision (as long as the outcome is low-risk), and might be more useful in scenarios that are very emotional and personal in nature – such as speed dating e.g. In situations however where it is possible to weigh up evidence and calculate results, this should generally be the preferred decision making option. Though if the latter only serves to back up the former, then this is your best case scenario."<br><br>So any more sources, insights, etc?</div>

<div class="content">Upon researching some more, I came upon Daniel Kahneman 's "Thinking, Fast and Slow."<br><br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman-ebook/dp/B00555X8OA/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman-ebook/dp/B00555X8OA/</a><br><br>Just bought the ebook and about to start reading it.  From cursory reading around it seems very interesting, and even helped me think about the heuristics in my current TM.</div>

<div class="content">I used to agonize forever about what to order in restaurants. What do I feel like? Old favourite or something new? Then I realized that the goal was a nice meal with friends, not the perfect choice. Now I go with the flow. Some places, I'm working through the menu, top-to-bottom (omitting the expensive dishes). Others, often fast-food places, I just get the same thing each time.</div>

<div class="content">I'm not positive this book is relevant, but my vague recollections say that it is:  Hare Brain, Tortoise Mind by Guy Claxton.<br><br>I read it a number of years before I heard about Thinking Fast and Slow, and when I first heard of Kahneman's book I thought it sounded like it was on the same subject as Claxton's.<br><br>I still haven't read Kahneman, and it's been more than a decade since I read Claxton.  My recollections are fuzzy, and Claxton may be out of date, but I found Claxton fascinating.  It looks like he's got a more recent work called Intelligence In the Flesh that may be related as well.<br><br>(Now I want to dig out my copy of HB,TM and re-read!)</div>

<div class="content">Malcolm Gladwell (Blink, and others) is very thought-provoking. But watch out! He wields the narrative fallacy like a weapon. <a href="http://archives.cjr.org/the_observatory/the_gladwellian_debate.php" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://archives.cjr.org/the_observatory/the_gladwellian_debate.php</a></div>

<div class="content">I just listened to a podcast that discusses a bit of this as it regards to being creative and perhaps "focusing" the unconscious, or as he put it, obtaining "a perfect balance of focus and unfocus"<br><br>The podcast is an interview of author and  psychiatrist, Dr Srini Pillay and he talks about the research and experiences behind his new book, Tinker, Dabble, Doodle, Try.<br><br>I have yet to pick up the book but I enjoyed the insights the podcast provided so I thought I would share.  <br><br><a href="http://www.pencilkings.com/how-to-unlock-your-creativity/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.pencilkings.com/how-to-unlock-your-creativity/</a><br><br>(perhaps I liked it because one of my main hobbies is art and painting)<br><br>Brent</div>

<div class="content">Brent, <br>Thank you for the link to the podcast. I like the "unfocus" tip about going for a meandering walk, rather than a loop around the block.</div>
