<div class="content">Here are my Top Five:<br>1 - Standing Out - trust your intuition to guide you in selecting what is to be done next<br>2 - No List - trusting your intuition even further by relying on it completely to guide your work day-to-day, hour-to-hour<br>3 - Randomizer - the effectiveness of this system convinced me that most of the effort spent on prioritization is a complete waste<br>4 - Little and Often - eliminate resistance by giving yourself permission to work as long or as little as you want on any given task - which is another way of trusting your intuition - and at the same time, improve flow by reducing your batch sizes<br>5 - Current Initiative - focus on one major initiative at a time<br><br>And some close Runners-Up:<br>6 - Manana Principle - capturing all incoming work on tomorrow's page so it's all batched up and ready for you as a Closed List - completing it gives a strong sense of closure<br>7 - Filing - use a monthly tickler file for general filing; file your projects in LIFO order (just put it on top of the stack) - so much simpler and more effective than any other filing system I've tried<br><br>I'm probably missing something...  I've learned so much from Mark, his books and blogs, and this forum.</div>
