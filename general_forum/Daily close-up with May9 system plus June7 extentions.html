<div class="content">One of the features of (most) no-list systems that adds to their output-focusedness, is the daily artifact they create. At the end of the day you have a paper slip with all that you have accomplished on that day. With most other systems this would have to be created with additional notching down efforts.<br><br>The June7 extensions help with that while simultaneously worsening the situation.<br><br>You end up with tasks that you didn't work on but still had on the list, because you first had to not work on them, before you scratched them off. This dilutes the "picture of the day."<br><br>OTOH, with other no-list systems, when the end of the day draws near, the adding of tasks ("to the hammer") becomes a bit comical, because you know you probably won't do them. With the June7 extensions you just go and when you stop working, you have a nice close-up procedure of crossing-off the tasks (and maybe still do one or two of them). All within the rule-set and not just so!<br><br>Even without June7 the May9 system has a nice way of closing the day and creating that artifact.</div>
