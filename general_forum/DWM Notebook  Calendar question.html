<div class="content">A friend just gave me a nice medium sized black notebook ( a large Moleskin type) with thinly lined pages. <br>I'm thinking I could number the pages  and use it a DWM notebook.<br>Has anyone tried this kind of thing and if so, would you recommend it?</div>

<div class="content">Just to clarify -- has anyone tried numbering the pages of a blank book for DWM use?</div>

<div class="content">Steve,<br><br>I believe Alan suggested it.  One thing it has going for it is that you can stop the system any time you like and pick it right up on the next page when you get back to it.</div>

<div class="content">So do you just number 1-31 and then 1-31 again, etc.?</div>

<div class="meta">2010-02-5 16:10</div>
<div class="content">Steve,<br><br>You'd just number the pages from 1-N.  Or in the SUPER simplistic system Alan described, you could forget the numbers and only have 30 pages with a clip at 30 and 7.  Each day add a page to the end and move the clip for 30 and 7 and discard the first page.</div>

<div class="content">I'm having trouble visualising how either of these would work.<br><br>If you have a notebook and number the pages from 1-31 and then again 1-31, how do you keep track of which pages you are supposed to be on? It's fine to say put a clip on the pages, but human memory being what it is (or at least mine being what it is) I would forget to move one or both clips, and then I would lose track of time. As the 1-31 is not related to a actual date you can't check easily whether you are on the right day.<br><br>This would be even worse if you had unnumbered pages with a clip 7 and 30 (or 31 or whatever). I would be constantly moving one and forgetting to move another, or forgetting whether I had moved one at all. And then I would have to count up to see if I'd got the right interval. I couldn't see myself doing this for very long without getting thoroughly irritated by the whole thing.<br><br>Although it does appear to make it easier to skip days, I suspect the actual effect will make it very tempting to avoid the dismissal process by finding an excuse for not moving on to the next day. Since there's no link-up with any definite date, it just becomes too easy to cheat. In fact the method I recommend of re-dating the calendar pages is quite satisfactory and doesn't make it easy to cheat.</div>

<div class="content">As far as I'm concerned:<br>Notebook with dated pages = pretty much the same as a diary/calendar, but without the tube map (if you're in the UK). It works for me anyway.<br>Notebook with numbered pages: completely different kettle of fish in my view.<br><br>To be honest though, I don't think anyone can really tell yet if either will work long-term (even Mark's a 'beta tester' on this system). <br><br>I'm happy at the moment: I suspect it's really more a psychological benefit - put simply it's an enjoyable system to work, and I hadn't really got that so much since the original AF. I'm fairly sceptical of any claims that a time management system can massively boost my productivity - I'm probably fairly productive most days anyway, and I invariably find a way of circumventing any time management system on the days when I'm not! (Who wants to be 100% productive 100% of the time anyway!) But anything that makes my work more enjoyable, and gives me more sense of control, is a massive boost.</div>

<div class="content">I tried DWM briefly with numbered pages before going out to buy a daily calendar/diary. The psychological effect of having actual dated pages is very different from numbered ones. I find the calendar keeps me more grounded to reality, if that makes any sense - since today's date is very clear.<br><br>It's my feeling that a calendar works much better with the DWM system, but unfortunately I can't articulate it very well.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>My point was not that I think it won't work.  I am using it and it DOES work.  I'm simply saying that it is a struggle for me and you are getting substantial feedback which is telling me, at least, that others are having trouble as well.  Perhaps others are having different problems.  I don't know.<br><br>If I thought this would not work I'd not have bothered.  Reading your description was all it took for me to KNOW it would work and is better than AF4.</div>

<div class="content">I'm working with a ruled notebook where I've *dated* the pages. That way I can make the dates as small as I'd like (which helps me think of it less like a calendar and just "pages with dismissal dates"). Works fine for me.<br><br>Putting  paperclips(different colors) at the one-week and one-month page to find them easily.<br><br>Thinking of migrating to a thin filofax type binder.

<div class="content">I am quite confused Mike.  I think you said<br>- You use dated pages.<br>- You use unnumbered pages<br>- You use clips to find pages or something else.<br>- It works for you.<br>- It's also a struggle for you.  (But it's working, so what's the struggle?)<br>- You think others are struggling.<br><br>What are you really claiming?<br><br>Quite aside from this, I know at the start I was quite baffled by Mark's use of the diary.  It's different from what I (and the world) expect and how we interpret dated entries.  The dateless system I described was a *conceptual aid* to get past the *mental block* of "misappropriating" the diary for a new use.  Now the concept is clear, let's go back to the calendar.  Use dates.<br><br>Unless someone actually is working dateless and likes it that way?</div>

<div class="content">The closest I'd go to "dateless" is to use Monday-Sunday names instead the date, just because at home, I know what day of the week it is before I know the date. I haven't done it, and I may not, but it's lingering in the background.</div>

<div class="meta">2010-02-5 19:47</div>
<div class="content">I use a notebook, one sheet per day. Since I use 28 days not a month, I put names of the days and the dates on the top ("Friday" above column 1 and "Expires: February 5th,  2010, above column 2).  I number pages 1-28 at the bottom right corners so flipping to the right page is easy even without a bookmark.<br><br>It is always today's page number +7 or today's page number again but in the next sequence of numbering.  To differentiate them easier, the first sequence 1-28 of page numbers is in a different ink color. So if I'm on the page #5 in blue, page today+28 will be again page #5 but in red.  I may double check at the top that it is Friday as well.  The date is not important until it will become today's page in about a month.</div>

<div class="content"><<Unless someone actually is working dateless and likes it that way? >><br><br>I really don't have any axes to grind. I used the dated system for a full day. I didn't like the fact that my diary forced me to write in tiny, cramped, handwriting.<br><br>So, I switched to the dateless, numbered pages. Note, my main problem with the diary was not the dates, but the height (or lack thereof) of the page lines. <br><br>Given that I was custom-building my diary, I decided to build it, as much as possible to my own needs and my own specifications.<br><br>So, if you want to cast stones, please cast them at me, not at Alan Baljeu. I apologize for designating my implementation as Alan's. He was just providing a very nice conceptualization of DWM. I liked his conceptualization so much, that I "tweaked" DWM, if you want to call it a tweak. I don't. I think that I AM doing DWM.<br><br>I know that I have a vacation planned the week of February 15. So the numbered pages allow me to deal with that vacation seamlessly. <br><br>My system uses "clock arithmetic." If you are using a 24-hour clock, 2 hours after 23:00 is 1:00. My system has a 20-day monthly cycle. (I typically go to the office Monday-Friday.)<br><br>If today is day x, and I have to re-enter an item, I re-enter it on page x + 5. If I have a new item to enter I enter it on page x + 20. If today is day 17, a week from today is day 2. A month from today is day 17.<br><br>If I had a diary that I liked, in terms of size, I would have stuck with it. But I didn't, so I didn't.<br><br>To me, the difference between dated pages and numbered pages is about as significant as using black ink or blue ink. OK. That's a bit of an exaggeration. A better analogy would be ink versus pencil.<br><br>By the way, I am still very enthusiastic about DWM. This week I have had more discretionary time than is typical for me. So that helped. Nonethelss, the "feel" of DWM strikes me as suitable, even for days when I have much less discretionary time. It keeps my highly focused on those items which are closest to expiration. And it allows me to get a "win" every time I move my nearest active page further into the future.</div>

<div class="content">As I'm still considering using 31 (or so) index cards for my DWM system, my plan is to put some sort of date on the new card each day, and tear up the oldest card (which represents yesterday). I could use the conventional date (06 Mar 2010) or just the [Julian] day number in the year (Day 065). I think the latter might be best, to subdue the suggestion that something be done on a particular (future) date. The danger is in forgetting to add & tear up one card each day. So a reference Julian Day calendar might be necessary to keep in sync.</div>

<div class="content">Well, I must admit that I struggle with dated pages. I always have the feeling that a certain task doesn't fit on a certain page, because it's the "wrong" date. <br><br>Isn't DWM more a AF5? Differences to AF1-4 are:<br>* different dismissal system (every day one page is dismissed and the next one is marked for dismissal tomorrow)<br>* different task entry (two entry points instead of one)<br>* simpler circulation (you go just round and round and do whatever "stands out")<br><br>Am I completely wrong?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Alan,<br><br>>>>  I am quite confused Mike.  <<<<br><br>Join the club ... we have jackets ;-)<br><br>>>>   I think you said<br>- You use dated pages.   <<<<br><br>Yes, I started using a Composition Book and manually dated the pages.  For reasons of portability, I switched to a Circa Compact and again, manually numbered the pages.<br><br>>>>  - You use unnumbered pages  <<<<br><br>No.  I have never said I used numbered pages.  I think it was YOU who suggested that as a simplification.  I could be mistaken about that, however.  In any case, I can see numbered pages being a useful alternative.  I've not tried the numbered pages yet.  I've not tried an electronic version yet.  I don't know if I will do either of those.<br><br>>>> - You use clips to find pages or something else. <<<<br><br>No, not clips.  I have plastic dividers labeled: "Today", "Re-Enter", and "New".  I've described my system in detail a few times now.  I move the pages past the dividers as time marches on.<br><br>>>>  - It works for you.  <<<  <br><br>Yes, so far it is working.<br><br>>>> - It's also a struggle for you. (But it's working, so what's the struggle?)  <<<<br><br>Just because something "works" that does not imply it is "struggle free", does it?  I have also described my "struggle" several times.  I get confused about where to enter things.  As with an earlier version, please feel free to tell me that I am not really having any trouble.  Any number of people told me that I was having no trouble then either.  However kind of them it might have been, it did not change the fact that I WAS INDEED having trouble.<br><br>But if you missed what I said about the "struggle", once more, it is getting confused about where to write things.  I'll periodically have reentered tasks on the 30 day page or entered them first on the 7 day page.  Please don't tell me that I'm stupid or inept or have too many toes on one foot or another ;-)  I'm simply describing what IS for ME.<br><br>>>>  - You think others are struggling. <<<<br><br>No, I think others are "complaining".  From those "complaints" I ASSUME they are having some "issue" ... I can't definitively describe it as a "strugggle", however.  Perhaps it is.<br><br>>>>  What are you really claiming?  <<<<br><br>As above ... that it is a nice system, it works for me, it confuses me in practice as I work it.<br><br>>>>  Quite aside from this, I know at the start I was quite baffled by Mark's use of the diary.  <<<<br><br>I'm not so much "baffled" as I think the emphasis on it is a mistake.  I get why it seems natural.  I also get that it does reflect the march of TIME, which is the essence of the dismissal method here.  HOWEVER, the use of a calendar has caused some confusion simply because it is a calendar book so people want to put appointments, deadlines, reminders, etc. in it.  That is what they have always done with calendars.  And it makes perfect sense.  I am ALSO putting reminders on the dated pages.  Why the hell not?  Once I have a dated page I'm going to use it to put dated events on.  I'm certainly not going to carry a SECOND calendar.<br><br>>>>  It's different from what I (and the world) expect and how we interpret dated entries. <<<<br><br>Precisely.<br><br>>>> The dateless system I described was a *conceptual aid* to get past the *mental block* of "misappropriating" the diary for a new use. Now the concept is clear, let's go back to the calendar. Use dates.  <<<<br><br>Too late ;-)  Once it is out there, people glom on to it and away it goes ... it develops a life of its own.<br><br>>>>  Unless someone actually is working dateless and likes it that way?  <<<<br><br>Not me ... not yet.</div>

<div class="content">Moises,<br><br>Why do you have to adjust your numbering for your days off?  One of the really strong points of the numbered (vs. dated) approach is that the numbers can be interpreted as "days on which I am working the system".  So if I am not using it for Saturday and Sunday, I can simply ignore the system and pick it up on Monday.  Here is an illustration:<br><br>1 Thr<br>2 Fri<br><br>Take Sat and Sun off<br><br>3 Mon (resume using system)<br>4 Tue<br>5 Wed<br><br>Leave on vacation for a month<br><br>6 Mon (first day back, resume using the system)<br>7 Tue<br>8 Wed<br>9 Thr<br>10 Fri<br><br>Take weekend off<br><br>11 Mon<br><br>Etc.  IOW, you never have to change numbering or alter the pages in any way.  That was why the idea seemed brilliant to me.  New items always go on today's number plus 30 and reentered items go on today's number plus 7.</div>

<div class="content">Ubi,<br><br>Suppose you forget to throw away yesterday's card.  (Though I'm hard pressed to imagine why you might because you would have lined through items on that card.)  What would be the downside?  You'd just work one more day on tasks on that card, enter more items on the day you entered yesterday and reentered yesterday.  Tasks are still getting done, right?  And that is the point of the system, right?</div>

<div class="content">Mike,<br><br>Well, not exactly as you described. I only use the list at work. Work usually is 5 days/week. So, my rule is to add 5 days or 20 days. <br><br>As you told Andreas, the system is configurable. So, I could make it 7 days and 30 days. But then that would always be more than a week and more than a month. Now, it is usually a week and usually a month.</div>
