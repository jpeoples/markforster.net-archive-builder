<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2017-05-10 20:22</div>
<div class="content">Last week I realized that my stress was yet again due to being behind on my work and not having a plan for how to deal with it or how to do better. When this happens, I usually fall back on AF1. This time, however, I decided to try DIT.<br><br>The reason I chose DIT is because the way of working the list sounds very close to how the person in the article, The Three Types of Urgent ( <a href="../blog/Three Types of Urgent.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2006/9/9/three-types-of-urgent.html</a> ), might work. This is my favorite article that Mark has written and years ago I have made it a personal goal to be like the person in the article.<br><br>Anyway, to make a long story short, on May 3rd, I started DIT with a backlog of twenty-nine items. As of the writing of this post, all items in my task diary since May 3rd AND my backlog are complete.<br><br>This is not a situation or feeling that I am accustomed to. Based on another great article, now the question is: "What can be done now?"<br><br>So should I start working on my project list or on my list for tomorrow?<br><br>Thanks for a great system Mark and for all the wisdom! I hope that you are doing well!</div>
