<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-05-2 19:07</div>
<div class="content">Inspired by Mark's upcoming new TM tool, I myself am trying a new TM method which, like Mark's own, tries to combine the best of DIT, AF, and DWM.  It is kinda clumsy, but since I started two days ago it has shown some promise.<br><br>Now WHY would I be showing this while I have been using this for the past two days ONLY?  Well, it's because once Mark's new TM tool is revealed I MAY abandon this project and take on Mark's on, and thus I would forget all about it..so I thought I'll make an online "journal" of sorts of it here while eagerly waiting for Mark's new tool.<br><br>Materials: a daily diary or notebook with at least enough lines/space per leaf back-to-back for AF4 (you'll see why later), a pen, and two hi-liters of different colors.<br><br>Method:<br>1) On the page/leaf dated for TODAY, do AF4, with three vital exceptions:<br><br>1.a) If the task just done is repetitious but has to be done again TOMORROW, cross it out and re-enter it on the page/leaf for TOMORROW.<br><br>1.b) At the end of the day, all tasks acted on repeatedly that day are crossed out and entered on the TOMORROW page/leaf.<br><br>1.c) At the end of the day, highlight all UNDONE tasks with a hi-liter that is of a different color than what you used earlier during the "review" process of AF4.  DO NOT RE-ENTER THEM INTO THE TOMORROW PAGE/LEAF.<br><br>2) This is now how it all becomes a bit clumsy.  For the next days, do AF4 on the TODAY page/leaf as outlined above.  However, this time, TREAT the highlighted tasks in the previous days as you would a DWM day: <br><br>2.a) On the page leaf for TODAY, do AF4 as outlined above, then after moving through the "open" list, go to the previous days.<br><br>2.b) Go through each previous day ONCE, doing the task that seems ready to be done, and move on until you get to the today page/leaf, where you treat it as in (2.a).  Repetitious tasks from the previous days that are now done are re-entered in the TODAY or TOMORROW page/leaf, where applicable.<br><br>3) All tasks not done PAST THREE DAYS PRIOR (or more or less, depends on you; I think I'll try three for now) are automatically dismissed.  It would be good to have a way of bookmarking pages up to three days prior; I have not gone there yet, but I would suspect just making A BIG X on the whole page/leaf of each day past three days ago would suffice.<br><br>So what do you think, guys?  I am going to later post my thoughts and experiences on this TM method.  And oh yeah, I haven't thought of a name for it yet...FrankenTM, maybe? ^_______^</div>

<div class="content">To clarify things, I would like to edit step (2.a) :<br><br>2.a) On the page/leaf for TODAY, draw a line over the items previously entered and treat them as the "backlog," then do AF4 as outlined above, then after moving through the "open" list, go to the previous days.</div>

<div class="content">I looked at a similar thing when I was into DWM, but it didn't work out.  Fundamentally it was the date thing that made it not work: I don't run the system consistently every day every week.  So for me having anything date dependent turns out to be unworkable.  Otherwise it might have worked.</div>

<div class="content">@Alan: Yeah, well, the system did not pan out.<br><br>As you said, not using the TM tool for more than a day will derail its use.  However, the problem with it, I guess, is that it is ME who is filtering the tasks, NOT the TM system, which increases psychological resistance in its use.  <br><br>I cannot think of any other way of improving it, so I am abandoning this one.</div>

<div class="content">Hi nuntym,<br><br>Your system really was innovative and well-designed.  However, I can see the problems that one could encounter.  I tried to design my own system some time back and it did not work out either.  Good thing we have Mark and his brilliance at doing this for us!<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">I was trying to say that DWM doesn't work for me because I'm not every day with the system.  Which means, things get dismissed on me which shouldn't, and the above tweaks really don't solve the problem.  I had to get rid of the dates entirely.  Going back to AF which isn't driven by the calendar was my way out.</div>
