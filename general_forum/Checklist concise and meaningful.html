<div class="content">How depressing a checklist: <br><br>1. Don't touch anything.<br>2. Don't speak.<br><br>Personally I think we can make more satisfactory ones.</div>

<div class="content">@Alan: it was merely a little bit of light relief.  I hope you're not suffering from a temporary humour/humor by-pass.<br><br>Goodness knows, most of us need light relief now and then, although I am feeling heartened like others by the sight of the 6th, 7th, 8th  . . . .Chilean miners coming to the surface today.<br><br>Assuming the displayed notice is indeed in a light aircraft/airplane, it is valid when you think about how often the right-hand seat is often occupied by a non-pilot.  I was told last month in a Tiger Moth biplane not to touch anything until the pilot in the cockpit behind said it was ok!</div>

<div class="content">Sorry about that Roger.  Normally I appreciate humor, but not the sort this site offers.  It never occurred to me the sign was real.  Hm!<br><br>Hooray for the miners and the rescue team.  I wonder if they have a checklist they follow for each lift?</div>

<div class="content">No probs, Alan,<br><br>It's almost certain there are checklists being used, there was a discussion about whether the lifting might be interrupted for certain maintenance deemed critical, eg to stop the cable twisting and making the passenger nauseous!<br><br>It's been a wonderful story, such a contract to the normal doom and gloom, sensation-seekers, celebrities in name, but absent in real talent.<br><br>I've just seen a guy talking on TV about all the media spin-offs, movies etc.  I reckon a good title wound be 'Checklist 33' or 'Dateline 13/10/10=33' or just '33'.</div>
