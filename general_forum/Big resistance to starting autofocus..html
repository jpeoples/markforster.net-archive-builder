<div class="content">By the time you read this, i would have probably started using it, however this is perhaps another effort to avoid starting it!<br><br>Just like most of you I got the instructions a week ago on Monday, after initially dismissing it, I followed the forums for awhile and decided it actually was an awesome system. To i decided to start a 30 day trial of it, starting on Monday, on which i haven't started yet at all. <br><br>While I see AF being a good system for managing the things 'to do' and all the tasks, i've been caught up in bigger picture stuff, trying to 'figure it all out'. which hasn't really ben productive for me at all. I often find myself stuck in this part of things.<br><br>I know this is going to be a big challenge for me in getting moving with the system but also in continuing to move with it, as I know from past experience I will want to stop and figure things out. I just want to really have things right, I wanna do something great. and i always feel that i need to figure out exactly what that is and exactly what the right mindsets and attitudes are to create that, which always stops me from actually doing it!<br><br>*sigh* I guess I will get started, I love the idea, I just don't feel comfortable starting it at all. I don't know what things i shoud put on it, what i shouldn't how i should word it all, what would be the best way to use it, the right type of paper, the right pen etc etc.</div>

<div class="content">Smarky,<br><br>Might be worth adding an item to your list called "Reflect upon the position of AF in the bigger picture"  and then spend the appropriate time doing that - whilst working on all the other items on the list.   What works for me with AF is the fact that you can park any kind of activity in a single place...<br><br>regards<br><br>Dave</div>

<div class="content">That's what i've done, i've put individual parts that I want to look at onto the autofocus list, to try and keep it separate, and so it's not something i have to have fully figured out in order to start working on everything!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Smarky<br><br>The best advice for me was in Mark's original email where he said to just start with the Quick Start Guide and only once you had worked with it for a bit to then read the full instructions.  I think you've got yourself into a position of overload.<br><br>Try the following as a starter AF List<br><br>Find notebook (Mark reccommends standard A4 lined pad)<br>Find writing implement<br>Make coffee (tea is ok!)<br>Sit down<br>Write another 5 items on the list (can be anything!)<br>Enjoy ...........<br><br>One thing I found is that because the system is so simple I can use all of my "deep seated need to improve a system" on the other systems I am using that really do need to be improved!<br><br>Just go and have fun with it - and remember Hakuna Matata!<br><br></div>
