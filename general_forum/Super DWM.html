<div class="content">I wonder if the SuperFocus approach can be applied to DWM by adding new tasks both to the page one is currently working on, and to the page a calendar month from now.<br><br>This would seem to add the benefit of keeping new tasks within radar range whilst maintaining the strong DWM dismissal rule. <br><br>Items are written twice, but the within-radar entry can be subsequently deleted when moving to the next page.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Laurence,<br><br>I think that could work.<br><br>Although I no longer use DWM and am starting out on SAF (my 'watch and wait' did not last long!), there is one tweak which I still use to mop up tasks no matter how many pages my lists may cover.<br><br>When I write the entry date on the last page, or for any task entry, I put today's date and then in brackets the dates for 21 and 28 days hence.<br><br>So for today's new entries, I write 15/11/10 (06 - 13/12).<br><br>Then on those bracketed dates, I have a more reflective look on those tasks to see if I must or should get them done, or dismiss them.  Of course, when I have a hard due date for any task I put that date (or maybe one or two days before, depends) in [brackets] after the task, plus I might enter a reminder in Outlook in case I am away from my SAF notebook or computer so that my smart-phone will remind me.</div>

<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>Now here is an idea: in DWM2, make the end of the list mobile.<br><br>1) Before starting the day, close your DWM2's previous day as originally instructed.<br>2) Get a clean lined piece of paper and label it "TODAY" at the top.<br>3) Treat this piece of paper as both the end of your DWM2 list and as a bookmarker.<br>3.1) Write all the re-entered and new items on this piece of paper as you would at the end of a usual DWM2 list.<br>3.2) Insert this paper between the pages where you are in working  the DWM2 list.<br>4.) At the end of the day, write the remaining tasks at the end of the list then close it as per usual DWM2 instructions.<br><br>I think this will also work with DWM1...probably much better if one's using a binder notebook.<br><br>So what happens is you practically have the DWM's version of Column 2 in SAF, but instead of a different Column 2 per page of SAF, you have a "traveling Column 2" wherever you are in your DWM list. <br><br>Of course the downside is the re-writing at the end...unless, as I had mentioned, one's using DWM1 and a binder notebook wherein he/she can remove/insert pages at will.<br><br>God bless!</div>

<div class="content">A) this is exactly DWM2 just with more convenient rewriting, or<br>B) your intention is to follow SuperFocus rules on each page you visit. That could be very interesting.</div>

<div class="content">To add on to Alan's point B... you wouldn't be using SAF dismissal, would you?<br><br>To be honest, I move through my DWM list fast enough that where new things get entered isn't really an issue for me; I make it through my list (which generally hovers in the 40-50 entry range) multiple times daily.  On top of that, the power of Mark's systems (all of them) for me has been that they temper my tendency to have a thought and then lose hours pursuing it when if I had jotted down the idea and come back to it later, I might no longer think it's important or the time I spend on it will be more productive time.</div>

<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>I think I've done it! I have been trialing a new way of processing DWM2 that does minimal changes to it that promises to be closely resembling SAF both in appearance AND effect.  And for the past three days I have using it, it's been very effective.<br><br>Now what I really like about it are the very unexpected results:<br><br>1) It stabilizes the use of DWM2. The problem with "Ping-Ponging", which is how I tend to use DWM2 before this, is that it disturbs the decision making when processing the list.  This eliminates it.<br>2) As you will see, it can be ALSO be used in plain vanilla paper based DWM, and probably other TMS's as well.<br>3) The flexibility of use that I experienced with DWM2 is retained, and even enhanced.<br>4) Most surprisingly and delightfully, it can be used to manage projects.  Yes, PROJECTS!<br><br>There are, however, some minor disadvantages.<br><br>1) You will have to follow my own way of DWM2; that is, only unfinished tasks are to be treated as "re-entered" tasks (to be dismissed on the 7th day after re-entering) or the system will be too awkward to use.  <br>2) You will have to re-write a half page to a whole page of tasks every few days.<br>3) You may easily loose the separate piece of paper that you are going to use, so BE CAREFUL!<br>4) I cannot think of any way to duplicate this electronically.<br><br>So here we go: the instructions!<br><br>Part I: main DWM list<br>1) You need your DWM or DWM2 list and a separate piece of paper.<br>2) Use the separate piece of paper as a bookmark for your current location in the DWM list.<br>3) You will never write your "re-entered" tasks into your main DWM list ever again, but ALWAYS into the separate piece of paper.  As a review, "re-entered" tasks are unfinished tasks which, if unactioned, will be deleted after 7 days.  All new and finished recurrent tasks are entered in the main DWM list at the 30-days-away mark.<br>4) You CAN (not always) also write your urgent or important tasks on the separate piece of paper; however, when they are added there, they MUST be treated always as "re-entered" tasks.<br>5) You can work on any task either on the separate piece of paper or on your current location on the main DWM list anytime.<br>5.a) If a task on the main DWM list OR on the separate piece of paper was completed but is recurrent, re-write it into your main DWM list.<br>5.b) If a task on the main DWM list OR on the separate piece of paper was not completed but have to be stopped for now, then cross it out and re-enter into the end of the list at the separate piece of paper.<br>6) At the end of the day or on the morning of the next day, if there are remaining tasks that were re-entered on the spent day, draw a line across the separate piece of paper at the end of the list with some space for tally marks (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tally_marks" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tally_marks</a> ), and write a tally mark for "1" into the space. The piece of paper is then ready for the next day.<br>6.a) For each day onward, as long as there are remaining tasks before each, add a tally mark into the space of each line until it reaches "7", upon which you dismiss everything before the line.<br>7) Once the separate piece of paper is about to be filled out, re-write all the remaining tasks into another piece of paper, with their appropriate positions and separating lines with tally marks preserved, and use this for the succeeding days. You may throw away the old one.<br><br>* I will, in the very near future, put a scan here of my piece of paper for clarification. <br><br>Now, here is how you use it for projects, if you have separate project files like Alan or me.<br><br>Part II: Projects<br>1) You may anytime add "Work on Project X" to your main DWM list ONLY, UNLESS the project is urgent, upon which you may add it to the separate paper list, upon which it is now subject to the Part I rules above.<br>2) When you are working at the main DWM list and you think of something to add to one of your projects, you have the option of writing the task into the piece of paper list BUT (a) with a different mark before it to indicate that it is not subject to the "re-entered tasks" rules of Part I above (unless it is a very urgent task, upon which it is become subject to Part I rules), and (b) with an indication that it is to be added to the project, eg. (using Alan's example) "Task --> X"<br>3) When you decide to work on your project, add another bookmark to your main DWM list to indicate where you are last, bring the separate paper into your project file, and work on the project<br>3.a) Transfer all "Task --> Project" tasks from the separate paper into the appropriate projects and cross them out from the separate paper.<br>3.b) You may anytime work on the project tasks OR on the tasks in the separate paper, using ALL the rules of Part I, this time with the project tasks taking the place of main DWM list tasks, with the minor revision of indicating the "re-entered tasks" as part of a project, eg. "X: Task"<br>3.c)  If you think of something to add to the main DWM list, you have the option of writing the task into the piece of paper list BUT (a) with a different mark before it to indicate that it is not subject to the "re-entered tasks" rules of Part I above (unless it is a very urgent task, upon which it is become subject to Part I rules), and (b) with an indication that it is to be added to the main DWM list, eg."Task --> DWM"<br>3.d) Upon leaving the project, you may add the project into the separate piece of paper under the rules of Part I ONLY if it is urgent.<br>4) Upon leaving the project, bring your separate paper into the main DWM list where you left it, transfer all "Task --> DWM" items into your main DWM, and work on the list as before.<br><br>So that's it! If there are any questions (and I know there will be, as I know myself to be notoriously overly-verbose and vague in my instructions) please post them here.<br><br>God bless!</div>

<div class="content">Interesting variation.<br><br>Is it correct to say the main change is what DWM writes at +7 (re-entered because unfinished) goes onto a separate page rather than the end of the list (or column 2). That keeps them together, visible and more "permissible" than if they were on another page in the main list.<br><br>You can use a large post-it-note rather than a loose paper. (I've seen them as large as 5x7"). Or use a binder rather than a notebook and cut one page in half, so it still fits in the binder but doesn't cover the page. Loose pages become lost pages.<br><br>You're like me -- you'd rather write an idea down on the nearest available paper (in this case the separate list) rather than flip around to the correct page. All that flipping around, and then seeing tasks for that project, takes me away from the current task.</div>

One is to bring the projects, calendars, to-dos, etc. into one over-arching system that emphasizes one of these. Or, if you will pardon the analogy, it's like a company dominating other companies to make one megacorporation.  This is the paradigm of Covey's Seven Habits (goal setting and accomplishment dominating others) and GTD (contexts dominating others). The other paradigm is that one system gathers information from all the other systems to make decisions, and sometimes sending back information to the other systems.  Continuing the previous analogy, it is like one company receiving parts from other companies to make the finished products.  This is the paradigm of Mark's AF and DWM systems.<br><br>This Super DWM is different.  From my use, I find that it is trying to unite the other systems by informing ALL the systems of PERTINENT information while letting the different systems DO what they do best.  And again using the previous analogy, it is like a courier company sending the needed parts and products from one company to another to make the whole economy work.  And the system is able to do this because of the separate piece of paper: it holds the most important tasks you have --- the urgent, important, and unfinished tasks --- and keeps them always before you even when you work the other systems like checklists, projects, the main DWM list, calendars etc., while at the same time, it facilitates the transfer of information from one system to another in an unobtrusive manner.  And the thing is, I think it can be used for any of Mark's systems.  It is nothing like I have ever used before.<br><br><<You're like me -- you'd rather write an idea down on the nearest available paper (in this case the separate list) rather than flip around to the correct page.

THANK YOU! I think I know of a possible way of removing the need to re-write the separate piece of paper every few days.  I am going to trial it now.<br><br>Here's a hint: Post-It Snake ^___^<br><br>-----<br><br>God bless!</div>

<div class="content">I think I understand the concept nuntym, but not quite how it's realized through your system. If you can illustrate with examples of what might happen, that would be good. <br><br>I think what you have in mind has a connexion to Vannevar Bush's paper, "As we May Think".</div>

<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>Which one, Alan? The separate piece of paper (from henceforth known as SPP) as a uniting system, the different paradigms, or Super DWM using Post-Its?<br><br>Well the Post-Its thing is just an idea, haven't implemented it yet.  The different paradigms...well, lemme think about them more.  But SDWM as a uniting system, I think I can give it a go.<br><br>What makes the DWM version I'm using right now unique from other TMS's is the SPP. The SPP, as I defined it from the rules above, contains all the unfinished tasks as well as the very urgent and important tasks too pressing to be placed in the 30-days-from-now point in the main DWM list or on any other system, and these tasks are to be dismissed 7 days from now if not actioned by then.  The SPP also contains items you want to transfer from one system to another, for example from the DWM list to a project file, or vice versa.  These "to-be-transferred" items are not under the 7-day-dismissal rule and are marked differently.  And since the SPP is, well, a separate piece of paper, you can bring it to any system you are concentrating on, either on the main DWM list, or your calendar, or your project files, or beside your computer.  <br><br>Now if you can picture what I had just said, then you might just realize the power of the SPP.  It carries the most important tasks you need to do -- the very urgent, very important, and the unfinished tasks --- and you bring it to every system you have to work on; you can also add the unfinished and important/urgent tasks from those other systems to the SPP.  So what you have is a very powerful reminder of how much is on your plate right now.  And yet in spite of that you can still concentrate on whatever system you are working on, be it your calendar, your contacts, your projects, your checklists, etc, because of its handling of "to be transferred" items.  <br><br>For example, while you are working on your DWM list, you remember you need to add a task to Project X, so instead of either the hassle of getting that "Project x" folder from the cabinet and writing the task there or losing that reminder in the quagmire of your DWM list you just add "Task--> Project X" to your SPP.  You then have to work now on Project X so you get your SPP from the DWM list, transfer the tasks you wrote on the SPP to the project file, and put the SPP beside you as you work on the project's files, instead of putting that bulky DWM notebook alongside the project folder.  You then remember you need to add something to the DWM list, so you add "Task-->DWM" on your SPP without getting the DWM notebook and looking for that last page.  Somebody calls you to tell you of the new deadline of that project, so you write "Deadline 1/04/11 Project X --> Calendar" on your SPP.  However, you have to stop working on your project, leaving the task of that project you were doing unfinished, so you write "X: Finish task" and mark it as a "re-entered task."  You then return to your main DWM list with your SPP on the last page you were previously and continue processing it.  Later, you decide to take your SPP to your calendar and transfer the deadline date there, then transfer the pertinent tasks from your calendar to your SPP for transfer to your main DWM list and project files.<br><br>I hope you can now see the promised power of the SPP.  I just need to know how to overcome the re-writing dilemma of the SPP, and then it will be perfect ^____^<br><br>God bless!</div>

<div class="content">nuntym:<br><br>It comes over to me as an adaption of the 2nd Column  of SuperFocus to DWM. <br><br>If I understand the system correctly (big if!), I think there are two main things you need to look at more closely.<br><br>1)  The SPP doesn't seem to be very well integrated with the main list. I would recommend that you give more guidance on when the tasks on the SPP are to be considered. Saying that any task can be worked on from either list is not sufficient.<br><br>2) I think you need to break away from the idea that you are improving DWM and work on this system in its own right. In particular I think the rationale for the DWM dismissal rules has disappeared.<br><br>In short, I suggest you think out of the DWM box and consider what the best way of combining these two lists is. How can it work so that it's a seamless system?</div>

<div class="meta">2010-11-30 11:46</div>
<div class="content">My understanding is that the 7 day dismissal rule is important. I guess when you turn to day 7 in your notebook you will copy all/most of the SPP into that day 7 page. Next, given the automatic daily dismissal of DWM, nuntym is inclined to a free navigation pattern. Look at the list, at the paper, at the list, turn the page, whatever mood strikes.<br><br>But you may be eight Mark. And nuntym, beware that your projects lie outside the DWM list and thus avoid the strong doom of the calendar advancing.</div>

<div class="content">Alan:<br><br><< My understanding is that the 7 day dismissal rule is important. >><br><br>It is important in DWM, where it applies to all tasks which you have "activated" by doing some work on them.<br><br>But why should there be different dismissal dates for a task like "Email" just because one day you got to the end of all your email (30 day dismissal) and the next day you didn't (7 day dismissal)?</div>

<div class="meta">2010-11-30 15:56</div>
<div class="content">I find that a strange example Mark.  In fact, email shouldn't be neglected at all, so neither 7 days nor 30 are pertinent.  But 7 is certainly plenty.  With other tasks, 7 days is because you want to get it done.  30 days is because it is done, so you don't want to think about it again for a while.  But eventually you will have to get to it again but not this week.</div>

<div class="content">Alan<br><br>As you say, neither 7 days nor 30 are pertinent, which is the whole point of my example.<br><br>Unless I've misunderstood nuntym's system, many "done" tasks may well need doing again tomorrow or even again today, not in a week's time. <br><br>What I am saying is that the original 7 and 30 days had a rationale in DWM, but with this new system it might be better to find some other dismissal method - since neither 7 nor 30 days are particularly relevant to most re-entered tasks.</div>
