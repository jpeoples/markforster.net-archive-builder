<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-08-21 1:57</div>
<div class="content">Hello everyone,<br><br>today I decided to write yet another Autofocus application. I wanted something that was quick, unobtrusive and portable. If you work a lot with keyboard shortcuts, this might be for you.<br><br>Here is Version 0.1: <a href="http://cloud.github.com/downloads/andreashofmann/AutofocusAHK/AutofocusAHK.exe" rel="nofollow">http://cloud.github.com/downloads/andreashofmann/AutofocusAHK/AutofocusAHK.exe</a><br><br>Just download it and save it anywhere on your hard drive. I can run from usb drives, too. All tasks will be saved in a text file in the same directory, so it's 100% portable and leaves no traces elsewhere.<br><br>Okay, here's how to use it. It's probably different from anything you used so far for Autofocus. ^_^<br><br>Start the application, and you get a tray icon that says "af". Right-clicking this gives you a very small menu: About/Help and Exit. About/Help shows an about box with all keyboard shortcuts, Exit closes the application.<br><br>Here are the shortcuts:<br><br>CapsLock + a : Pops up a window where you can enter a new task, which will be added to the end of the list<br><br>CapsLock + d : Shows the current task and asks you if it feels ready to be done. Click yes to start working on it. Click no to go to the next task. Clicking cancel or pressing Esc just closes the window again. <br>If you've worked on something for a while, press CapsLock+d again and it will tell you what you've been working on and whether you want to re-add the task to the end of the list. Yes re-adds, no doesn't, cancel let's you work on the task a little longer.<br><br>CapsLock + c: Shows the current task.<br><br>CapsLock + s: Shows the next 30 tasks<br><br>Note that I use CapsLock for Hotkeys, because I don't have any use for it. If you use CapsLock for anything, you currently can only change the hotkeys in the source and compile it yourself.<br><br>The source can be found here: <a href="http://github.com/andreashofmann/AutofocusAHK/tree/master" rel="nofollow">http://github.com/andreashofmann/AutofocusAHK/tree/master</a><br><br>Note that version 0.1 lacks forward mode and review mode so far, all you can do is add, do, re-add, and move through the list in reverse mode. But when the next version is ready (tomorrow), you can just copy it over the old one and continue with the same list.</div>

<div class="content">AF Forum cheat sheet:<br><br>Andreas Hoffman: writes programs and captains the HMS Autofocus.cc website. Also just finished his thesis.<br><br>Andreas E: was feeling lazy. May or may not write programs too (I don't know). May or may not have just completed a thesis (I don't know).<br><br>But, I've seen a few posts that seem to confuse the two men. And, if neither of them are aware of the confusion, then how confusing a comment that confuses them must seem! (I.e. Someone told Andreas E. that he deserves to feel lazy after writing his thesis, and Silvia, you just asked Andreas Hoffman about laziness).<br><br>: )<br><br>Who's on first -- What's on second -- Idunno is on third!<br>-Joseph</div>

<div class="content">Well, to be fair, like Andreas E. I was pretty lazy lately, though for different reasons. :-)<br><br>There isn't even a contradiction between being lazy and writing this application, version 0.1 came into existance only yesterday and took only 3:49 hours so far. (I'm using a time tracker for all my programming activities.) Since I did not not accomplish much beside it yesterday, I still had a lot of idle time.</div>

<div class="content">Roadmap:<br>- Add morning routine which does the putting on notice/review<br>- Hotkey to show tasks on notice for review<br>- Implement review mode<br>- Automatically add "Change to review mode" to list after there exist tasks that are on review<br>- Make hotkeys and page size configurable through ini file<br>- Implement forward mode<br>- Automatically add "Change to forward mode" to list after there are 2+ pages<br>- Better GUI - Switch the message boxes with real windows to get rid of the windows default sound effect<br>- Better GUI - nicer List viewer<br>- Ultimately: if at all possible, synchronization with autofocus.cc<br><br>Highest priority is to keep the app lightweight and portable (usable from a usb thumb drive).<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Here is the file format of Tasks.txt:<br><br>Every line looks like this:<br>{Task description}{Tab}{Metadata}<br><br>Task description is what is shown to you in the application. I can contain anything except tabs.<br><br>Metadata contains mainly timestamps. Each timestamp has a preceding letter that indicates what it represents.<br><br>Example:<br>Implement review mode	A20090821100628<br><br>The A stands for "added". When the task is done, a new timestamp is added with a "D". When a task is put on notice, it's marked with "N" (but without a timestamp). Once it's on review, it gets a timestamp with "R". The timestamp in the metadata are separated by spaces, there is only one tab in the line, the one between description and metadata.<br><br>So this is the life cycle of a task:<br><br>1) Axxx -> Added<br>2) Axxx Dyyy -> Done before being put on notice<br>3) Axxx N -> On notice<br>4) Axxx N Dyyy -> Done after being put on notice<br>5) Axxx N Ryyy -> Put on review<br>6) Axxx N Ryyy Dzzz -> Re-added in review mode</div>

<div class="meta">2009-08-21 15:56</div>
<div class="content">Thank you.<br><br>The master branch now contains the code for the morning routine. Every day a user-defined time, tasks that are on notice and unactioned are dismissed, then the next block of unactioned tasks is put on notice. When AutofocusAHK is started for the first time, it creates a configuration file, which looks like this so far:<br><br>[ReviewMode]<br>LastRoutine=20090821<br>StartRoutineAt=6<br><br>LastRoutine is the date the last routine ran, this value is updated automatically every day. StartRoutineAt is the time at which you want the morning routine to take place. It can be a value from 0 to 23. Default is 6 in the morning. Depending on when your day starts, you may want to change this. If the app is not running at that time, the morning routine will run immediately when it's started.<br><br>Now I need to implement the review mode itself, then I will release version 0.2.</div>

<div class="content">Okay, version 0.3 is out, but no forward mode yet.

<div class="content">I found that when I downloaded "AutofocusAHK.exe" from github, it was still version 0.1 instead of 0.4 - must be a caching problem somewhere. So until I find a better way, just download <a href="http://cloud.github.com/downloads/andreashofmann/AutofocusAHK/AutofocusAHK-0.4.exe" rel="nofollow">http://cloud.github.com/downloads/andreashofmann/AutofocusAHK/AutofocusAHK-0.4.exe</a> and rename it to "AutofocusAHK.exe" before copying it over the old version.</div>

Just unpack/copy over the old version.<br><br>Forward mode is now there, so it's implementing the complete revised system. The task "Change to forward mode" is added automatically once there are three full pages. You can change the number of tasks per page via the ini file.</div>

<div class="content">Andreas,<br><br>Color me dumb, but where does this store the task list across a shutdown?  When I came up my few test tasks were gonzo.  I see in the ini file that DoBackups=1 so it should be backing up.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-09-1 14:06</div>
<div class="content">Mike:<br><br>It stores everything where you saved the executable. The tasks are saved in the file Tasks.txt in the same directory, the Backups are saved in a Backups subdirectory.<br><br>It's supposed to be portable, that's the reason for it to save everything in the same directory as the executable. But it could be a problem if you're running Vista or 7 and copied the executable in a directory which it does not have the rights to write to, for example the program files directory. Since you have an ini file, that does not seem to be the case with you. Do you have a Tasks.txt file?</div>

<div class="content">Andreas,<br><br>I don't know what happened.  Now I have the tasks.txt file.  I'm running Vista so I'm pretty used to odd things happening.  It could be that it had something to do with where FireFox placed it when I downloaded it.<br><br>But all is well now ;-)  Thanks.</div>

<div class="content">Mike:<br><br>Well, if it works now. ;-)<br><br>I skipped Vista, went straight from XP to Windows 7 yesterday. So far AutofocusAHK works under 7 just as well as it did under XP. Except I don't like the look of the timer window ...</div>
<h2>Reply by Andreas Hofmann</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-09-3 1:06</div>
<div class="content">Okay, I discovered a potential issue with Vista and 7 -  If the window that has focus has elevated privileges (runs as Administrator), the AutofocusAHK shortcuts won't work. There is not much I can do about it.<br><br>One solution is to run AutofocusAHK as Administrator by rightclicking the exe file and selecting "Run As Administrator". But that doesn't fix Autostart.<br><br>Another option would be to disable UAC, which would fix autostart, but I don't recommend it.<br><br>The pragmatic solution is to accept that the shortcuts don't work if you're in a window with admin rights. Just click once onto the taskbar and the shortcut will work again.<br><br>Normally I don't like applications that need admin rights, but I don't think it's possible so have global hotkeys that work on elevated rights windows if the don't have elevated rights themselves.</div>

Would love to try it again, when AH got the time to implement AF4 on it. <br><br>In mean time I'm using Google Doc Spreadsheet to implement the AF4 list, that can be as portable, accessible from any web device including mobiles. Using its "auto color rules" and cut&paste, I find it's as fast as writing the list in paper notebook. But it's not as automated as AFAHK nor as rigorous rules enforcement.  ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Version 0.9 is on its way. The code is more complex now that you can choose which system you want (get the current source release to test it with AF1-3), so I expect there will be some bugs.

<div class="content">Andreas:<br><br>I do thank you because your AutofocusAHK gave me a lot of ideas when I started writing the csvAF4 (and I would not have written it if you had released 0.9 a week earlier).  I tried the newest version and got two questions for now:<br><br>1. The dialog title bar says "Open List - Closed List - AF4" when I choose "Work" function.  How can I take this?<br>2. When do tasks get into Closed List from Open List?  According to the original instruction, if no items stands out in the Closed List, the tasks will get highlighed (on-notice status) and Open List items will become Closed List items.  However, this didn't happen when I began with a new task list and keep clicking "no."<br><br>I also used the AF1 mode, which reminded me of the excitement (and sometimes fearness) I felt back in January.

<div class="content">Silvia:<br><br>Thanks!<br><br>mit:<br><br>"The dialog title bar says "Open List - Closed List - AF4" when I choose "Work" function."<br><br>Oops, my mistake. That means you're in the open list. When you're in the closed list, the title says "Pass x - Closed List - AF4". Seems I replaced only the "Pass x" part with "Open List" instead of "Pass x - Closed List". I'll fix it. Btw, when you haven't taken any action on a pass of the closed list, the tilte says "Pass x(!)" to remind you that the closed list will be dismissed if you don't do something.<br><br>"When do tasks get into Closed List from Open List? According to the original instruction, if no items stands out in the Closed List, the tasks will get highlighed (on-notice status) and Open List items will become Closed List items. However, this didn't happen when I began with a new task list and keep clicking 'no.'"<br><br>The thing is, at the beginning there is no closed list, only an open list. That's why no dismissal happened for you when you kept clicking no, because the open list does not get dismissed. At some point, the first open list must be declared closed. The instructions are not specific as to when exactly that should happen. I decided to do it when the list contained enough items to fill a "page". So it depends on what ItemsPerPage in the ini file is set to (default is 15). When you start the application and you have more items  than this, the list becomes closed.<br><br>Perhaps I should add a trigger to the "add task" routine so it can happen without restarting the application in case someone never restarts it (computer always on or only in stand-by).<br><br>"I also used the AF1 mode, which reminded me of the excitement (and sometimes fearness) I felt back in January.

<div class="content">mit:<br><br>Seems I misinterpreted the rules here. What I meant by "not specific" was that there was no rule that said "close the list after x tasks", I searched for something to tell me when to close the first list based on the contents of the list. But I think I understand now that I don't need that, I should close the list based on the *behaviour* of the user. You mean I should close the list the first time a user opens the "work" window after creating a new list, right?</div>

<div class="content">Before someone asks, it is intentional that you cannot edit the notes while choosing which task to do. Following the little and often principle, changing the notes of an task is an action, so you have to work on the task to be able to change the notes. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">The more I use this program, the more impressed I am.  It makes working Autofocus so easy.  All you need to do is decide whether to do the task it's presenting you.  It takes care of the rules for you.  If you want the bigger picture, you press Caps Lock  E and it gives you a complete list to look at.  And whatever program you happen to be working on, you can simply press the hot key Caps Lock and A together to add a new task.  It's a very small and unintrusive program.<br><br>Furthermore, when I had a problem with it, I posted it to the forum and Andreas answered within a couple of hours telling me how to solve it.  That's great service ... for free!<br><br>I know it probably sounds as though I'm affiliated with Andreas somehow, but honestly I'm not.  I just think it's a great application!</div>

<div class="content">vegheadjones:<br><br>Well, it has no excel import. But you can save to csv format, then you have a text file. If you send me some sample data (say three lines from that file, an unactioned, done and dismissed task, you can replace the actual task description with nonsense for privacy reasons) to andreas@autofocus.cc, I can write a small converter for you. If privacy is no concern, you can of course send me your whole list and I'll convert it for you.<br><br>Alternatively just copy all unactioned tasks you want to keep in a text file, on task per line, call it Tasks.txt and save it in the same directory. You won't have the added date column, but otherwise it should work fine.</div>

<div class="content">Andreas,<br><br>I'm so sorry to post this here, but couldn't seem to find your website.  Anyway, I had tried your Autofocus program a while back, but wound up deciding to stick with paper.  I thought I deleted the program, but it loads everytime I turn the computer on and is starting to generate error messages.  I probably created a problem by incompletely deleting it.  But I can't figure out where the rest of it is. If there's anyway you could help me to remove it from my computer, I'd be most grateful.  My email is rmyoungesq at gmail dot com, if you want to email me directly.  Thank you so much.<br><br>Rebecca</div>

<div class="content">Rebecca:<br><br>The program is pretty much just the one exe file and some text files in the same directory, so if you removed that, the program is gone completely. What you still have is a link in your windows startup folder to my application, generated when you checked "Start AutofocusAHK with windows" in the preferences. So the error message you get is because windows wants to start my application, but can't find it because you deleted it. <br><br>To get rid of the error messages, just open your start menu, go to "All Programs" (or just "Programs", depending on your windows version) and find the folder "Startup". There should be a shortcut called "AutofocusAHK". Right-click it and select delete. That should be it.</div>
