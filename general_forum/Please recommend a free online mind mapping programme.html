<div class="content">I tried the Mindjet free trial and it was far too complex for what I needed. Seems great for project management and time management, but I use mindmaps for just two things - studying, and brainstorms - and it didn't strike me as particularly intuitive for either, plus it's heinously expensive!<br><br>If someone could recommend something better at no cost or negligible cost I'd be really grateful - currently I'm using Powerpoint and it is incredibly time-consuming!<br><br>Thanks all in advance.</div>

<div class="content">Search this site for "mind map" ... there have been some discussions on various packages.  You'll also find a wikipedia article on it and a web search will turn up sites that compare the packages.</div>

<div class="content">Freemind is pretty decent and free : <a href="http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page</a><br><br>You could also try Mindgenius, it has few more bells and whistles and cheaper and mindjet products: <a href="http://www.mindgenius.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mindgenius.com/</a><br><br>I use Mindgenius - the tree view plus notes pane are useful and export functionality to MS Word/Powerpoint helps too.</div>

<div class="content">I've also come across another alternative, although I haven't tried this one:<br><br><a href="http://www.xmind.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.xmind.net/</a></div>

<div class="content">I second the freemind recommendation, if you are looking for an offline application, as your post text is suggesting. If you're looking for a online application, as your post title is suggesting, take a look at <a href="http://www.mindmeister.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.mindmeister.com</a></div>

<div class="content">I use Freemind.  I found navigating around it quite 'clunky' at first but I've got used to it quickly and it does the job.  Though a bit of me wonders whether mindmapping isn't better done by hand.  I have found it quite restrictive using a package and wonder whether that diminishes some of the creativity benefits of mind mapping.<br><br>I think where the map is a planning tool then the 'order' of a package works okay but I would still revert to pen and paper for brainstorming.<br><br>Lucy</div>

<div class="content">Thanks all for the recommendations - I've gone for Freemind.<br><br>Lucy, I second your point that paper and pen are better for mind-maps. <br><br>However, as a neat-freak (for me, the best thing about GTD was the DYMO labeller!!) I like to transcribe my mindmaps afterwards: I'm hoping Freemind will do the job considerably better than Powerpoint.</div>

<div class="content">Incidentally, Tony Buzan strongly recommends redrawing your mind map after you create it.  Doing this is supposed to reinforce the concepts more strongly in your mind than if you don't.  So it sounds like you have a good plan going.</div>

<div class="content">Well, not only redrawing it, but reviewing it periodically and also creating a "master mind map" for a big subject you might be working on.  IOW, combine mind maps for several books yo9u might be reading on a subject to make one for the subject area that combines various points of view, etc.</div>
