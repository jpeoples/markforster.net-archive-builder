<div class="content">Who has tried the Consolidated list Mark is testing?<br>reference : <a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2011/2/21/what-next-consolidated-list.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2011/2/21/what-next-consolidated-list.html</a><br><br>Today I began to create several consolidated lists which to I refer in SF by "Check list A", "Check List B" but I would like to know if someone tried this and the number of lists he/her used.<br>And of course if it worked or not.</div>

<div class="content">After a fashion.  I have a couple of tasks which I have lists like that for that I go to and pick one out when I reach that task on my list, though some of the items on the list are 'order essential'.  Not all are though, so there's still a bit of picking and choosing.  But the only reason I've really done that is because the list is so big that leaving them on SF would clog that up completely.<br><br>As to whether it worked or not, I'm afraid I can't say at present.  I've hit a point where it's been necessary to barely look at my SF list while I am working every day at my 'other' job (though some of the items on the list are still percolating in my brain, and I can cross off at least two for today heh heh) as I am simply too exhausted to do more than the bare minimum beyond those hours (eat, dishes, laundry, sleep, exercise, remember to put my leftover dinner into my bag for lunch - thankfully I don't have to cook as my wonderful son does that).</div>

<div class="content">I've done this extensively and my conclusion is it's better to do minimally. Do with some key items you will work on where there's no confusion about what to do next or if something is better off dismissed. Do when there's a natural group of tasks that is useful to examine at once. Often it's good to take that list and write the next action y in SF beside the list reference.<br><br>But don't do too much of this things stop standing out.</div>

<div class="content">I think I am exactly in that case :<br>" Do when there's a natural group of tasks that is useful to examine at once. "<br><br>I feel the need to be able to quickly check a group of related tasks, which I grouped by activity (so there are different contexts and different projects gathered inside a single list).<br><br>In fact I am trying to do block time work on my most important activities (I intend to use these consolidated lists for that), and I would use SF when I need breaks or when I need to do something low energy.<br><br>I need a clear structure in my daily life, and I found that blocking my time with my main activities and doing SF inbetween could be the simplest and rather fool proof system for me.<br><br>At least I may post if it worked or not later on the forum.<br><br>In fact I am trying to use these lists as time blocked work, and SF inbetween when I need to take a break or just do something else.</div>

<div class="content">Been doing this for big projects I want to keep working on and keep in C2. Works well. I keep all the little tasks, ideas, notes related to the project in, say, a word doc that I'm using to do research on some topic. <br><br>Reason is because some projects little individual tasks are all interconnected, organic, changing rapidly and spreading them out throughout SF list didn't make sense.</div>
