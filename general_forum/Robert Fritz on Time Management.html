<div class="content">Robert Fritz is most noted as an author on creativity and developing creativity in individuals and organizations.  While reading his book Creating, interestingly there is a section on time management.  It struck a chord with me as he shares some of my thoughts and the thoughts of others here on time management like keeping it simple <br><br>Basically, he states he “hates” time management and many time management systems.  He shares my thought that many time management systems take too much time because they require too many forms, lists and other paraphernalia.  He recommends a simple system which is to use a single sheet of paper which is turned sideways and has 6 columns.  They are labeled within 1 day through within 5days and within 2 weeks. Everything you want to do is put on the form in one of these columns.  Each item is given a priority of A - D.  A= Imperative, B = Important, C = truly desired and D = mildly desired.  Anything other than A, B or C is immediately crossed off.  You then cross off the items as they are done, which can be anytime before the due date in the column.  He urges you to ad new items as soon as you know about them.  Fritz thinks organizing dimensionally rather than linearly is more efficient.  He note the key points as:<br><br>1.	Get the steps and actions out of your mind (sounds like a tenet of GTD).<br>2.	Think dimensionally, i.e. within 2 days rather than things to do on Tuesday.<br>3.	Keep it simple, do not spend too much time on forms.<br>4.	Cross of items as soon as they are done.<br>5.	Cross of items below a C priority.<br><br>He also espouses quickly writing things down to get them out of your head so they do not block creativity.  Also items not done in a week are carried over into the next week and then eliminated if they are not done in that next time period.  What is not really discussed is how often you do the form and what happens to something you write within one and then fail to accomplish it.  I am going to try to email the author and see if he will answer a few questions on this simple method.<br><br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://simple-time-management.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://simple-time-management.com</a></div>

<div class="content">>>>  He shares my thought that many time management systems take too much time because they require too many forms, lists and other paraphernalia.  <<<<br><br>And then goes on to propose multiple columns, for priorities, and a number of rules for processing.  How is that different than any other system, in terms of paraphernalia and forms and lists?<br><br>I fail to see how this is any different that doing a project review weekly, deciding what you will do during the upcoming week, prioritizing A-C and crossing off the Cs, then updating that list daily until the next review.<br><br>As to getting it out of your mind. A simple grass catcher list works wonders and does not get in the way of the processing of what you have decided to do.  Things on that list stand aside until their importance can be assessed and fit into the overall scheme of your week.<br><br>IMO, simple is better and a simple ABC list with time blocked out seems to work best.</div>

<div class="content">I am not sure I would adopt it, I found it interesting that some very GTD ideas seemed to be discussed in this section of the book like next actions.  I do find a system on one sheet of paper is simpler in some regards.</div>

<div class="content">If ultimate simplicity is the goal then the basic "Pick the most important thing to do and work on that one thing until it is finished." is the simplest possible system, I suspect.</div>

<div class="content">Paraphrased from the e-Myth: A woman went shopping for a blouse.  Her favourite colour was blue, but pink looked better on her.  A saleslady came by and told her yellow was the fashionable colour this year.  So she looked and thought and looked and imagined, and just couldn't decide.   So she bought a grey one instead, which she rarely wore because it was "dead".<br><br>Point is, in response to Mike, it's hard to decide when there are many choices.  It's a factor in AF's success that it narrows your focus to one item at a time and only asks you yes or no.  Asking to decide what's most important complicates the task in practice.</div>

Especially as Mike's question is actually:<br><br>"Pick the most important thing to do AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME and work on that one thing until it is finished."<br><br>That means that each time you needed to decide what to do next you would have to consider a whole range of variables as well as the entire range of things you could be doing.</div>

Again, in theory this makes sense. However I found the process of intuition and cycling to be cumbersome. I'd wager big $ that most people know (intuit) what they have to do but are scared to do it. I'm starting to wonder if most, if not all, systems get in the way of answering one basic question: <br><br>What stirs your heart? <br><br>Do that. <br><br>or..<br><br>What are you afraid of?<br><br>Do that.</div>

<div class="content">Maybe I'm a simpleton of the lowest order, but I have a list of only 21 things that I want to have done this week listed on the facing page of my week at a glance calendar.  5 of the 21 items have an asterisk beside them which means *a priority*.   It takes me about 2 seconds to decide what to do at any given moment when looking at my list.  Most of the time I don't have to look at it because I know what projects I'm trying to finish off this week and because the list is so short.<br><br>My life isn't flexible enough that there even is an entire range of things I could be doing most of the time except for between the hours of 8-11 pm during the week and occasionally on the weekend.  And there isn't a wide range there because I have some goals I'm trying to achieve so I don't have time for a bunch of other stuff.<br><br>When it comes to work, you might *think* you have many choices, but if you know what the big things are that will advance your career, get big, worthy projects completed - all that stuff that really makes a difference - then that's usually only a couple of key things.  If you don't know what those are, then figuring that out should be your first priority.<br><br>RF, you sound like Avrum. :-)  I don't know, life isn't all about fear and passion is it?  Seems kind of melodramatic for the 95% of things that make up our days.  Sometimes I just want to see something get finished "just because".</div>

I have.<br><br>I think that if you do try asking questions like that on a consistent basis you will find that your mind gradually starts to resist the implications of the question. The result will be either that your mind will only give trivial things as answers to the questions (so you'll be no better off than before), or you will end up in a state of complete paralysis (considerably worse off than before).<br><br>And remember that even the most megalomaniac projects consist of just one trivial step after another.<br><br>Huge project: Take over the world.<br>Step One: Order copy of Mein Kampf from Amazon.</div>

<div class="content">Re: Many choices:  You have as many choices as you want to have, IMO.  I have only a small handful of large projects and of those, I have only one I feel like working on one or two this week.  I make that decision for the week and then I'm done with choices.  The small steps take care of themselves as they are pretty obvious  I don't have to write down: "Call Joe" and "Look up Joe's Phone Number."  I mean some of this stuff is pretty silly if you think about it.<br><br>Most of what wound up on my AF list was the same stuff that was on my grass catcher ... and that was my "Ah Ha" moment ... that my AF list was really just my grass catcher list with processing rules.  That resulted in it getting in my way.  I mean, as I usually used it, I entered odd thoughts into it as I went but only culled from it on a weekly basis ... as I wound up using it (AF) I was in it continually and that was confusing.  Why confusing, you ask?  Because my grass catcher is unprocessed ... stuff.  I need to process it into projects, priorities, and so on.  If I don't do that, I have what you site as the  problem ... too many choices. I have make dinner, mixed in with do laundry with buy a new car.  Those don't mix well and need to be processed into an action plan.  I really don't find it helpful to read through it over and over and over.  Reading it once and deciding seems to be more in line with how I think.<br><br>Re: Asking what is most important:  That is the whole idea behind life ... do do what is important, however you define important.  If I just turn my life loose to the whims of the moment ... at the end of it (my life, my year, my month, my week ... or even my day) I'll have nothing to show but a bunch of time spent doing ... nothing important.<br><br>Re: "important at this moment":  Well, yes, this moment is the only one in play right now.  But no if the implication is that I can't look ahead to decide what is important to DO NOW, based on what will be important later.  THAT is exactly what planning IS.  Looking ahead to decide what I should be doing NOW.  IOW, I am not scanning hundreds of items over and over and looking at a whole range of variables.  I deal with those weekly then execute the plan daily.<br><br>Re: "Would you prefer".  Yes, but that is sales.  I handle my choices up front, not many times each day.  That is the problem I guess I experienced with AF which came to a peak with DWM ... scanning over all those different things CREATED choices .... choices I did not need and were not real.<br><br>Re: What stirs your heart.  I don't ask that question, but I am operating from principles like that.  My big goals were derived from that kind of question.  Once I had those big goals I no longer had to ask the question because I knew I had the answer already.  IOW, if I'm working on those big goals I'm doing "what stirs my heart".</div>

<div class="content">Many interesting thoughts here.  It seems most all of time management is lists and rules for processing them.  What I found interesting was that he thought in terms of an outside date to get something done as opposed to a list with no date or a calendar with a date certain.  The idea of next actions was also discussed, which also made it into GTD albeit at a later date.  <br><br>What I found intriguing was the idea that you use just a single sheet of paper as I am always looking for the simplest way to do things with the least rules.  Personally, I am not sure this is simpler than the steno notebook method I am using which so far has not failed me yet.<br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div>

<div class="content">I learned anew about my approach to tasks by using SmartLists for the iPhone before I prepared to leave town this weekend. Each task has to be given a time estimate. You must also enter the time you have to devote to these tasks today. As I knew exactly when I was leaving, that was quite simple. Tasks are manually ordered by priority and the bottom tasks that cannot be completed in the allotted time fade. What was quite apparent is that I am unrealistic about the number of things I can accomplish in a day. While I got an insane number of tasks done (I work well under pressure), I still had quite a few that were impossible to finish with the time available.<br><br>This understanding helps me in a couple of ways. First, it can help limit procrastination. Next time I am going out of town, I will know that I can't stay up late watching a movie sure that I can get everything done the next day when I'm leaving. Second, it helps me to recognize the value of task limits. It's the difference between "what would I like to get done today" and "what will I." I have been using the latter question with great results on my Goodtodo list each day. I immediately redate or delete tasks I know I won't get done so that all I see is an achievable number of to-do's. If they're all achievable, I don't prioritize them. I am still not recording every possible to-do. I had "clean" on my list of tasks before I went out of town. In the process of cleaning, I did many tasks that would have been recorded on my AF list in the past. As I worked I was so glad I hadn't wasted time writing, reviewing, and crossing them off. IMO, many tasks that aren't ready to be done yet shouldn't even be on a list.</div>

Why don't you just put them on the list and do them when convenient? <<<<br><br>Because that causes the problem we have been discussing: continually scanning things and being confused by "choices" and a great number of alternatives.  I enter an entirely different mind set when buying a car than when doing laundry.  IOW, when I am in a mental state where I can do laundry I am not in the state where I can buy a car so I can't even SEE those two items together without my braiin turning to mush.<br><br>>>>  And if you have lots of stuff on your list which you realise you are never going to do, why don't you just cross the items off instead of constantly scanning them?  <<<<br><br>Oh, that happens right out of the gate, and I cross things off as I go and decide that something has become irrelevant.   I seem to have been unclear about how my grass catcher works ... it catches things that just come up as I move through my day so that I don't have to distract from what I am currently doing to make decisions about or in any other way process them.  It is just a recording device.  Given that description you might see why adding processing to it raises Cain with the basic idea of the list in the first place.  I don't want that list processed (at least not daily and continually) ... I process it ONCE, on my WEEKLY review.  At that time I decide what will be done when and which things will continue to stew for a while.  IOW, my problem is not with the AF list (grass catcher) per se, it is with the processing rules.  I need to pull items I want to do an schedule and prioritize them so they get done at the appropriate time ... i.e. I am not doing laundry while thinking about buying a car.<br><br>As a result of this experience, I'm gaining a new respect for compartmentalization.  At Least as it makes time management work efficiently.</div>

<div class="content">Mike:<br><br>The idea that my brain might turn to mush if I were faced with a list that said "Make Dinner" "Do Laundry" "Buy New Car" is one that I find very difficult to relate to. I guess we'll just have to accept that our minds work differently.</div>

<div class="content">I'm with you Mark. They tyranny of small choices sucks. Simply walking into an American supermarket is mind boggling. How many toothpastes do I really need to choose from (and I work for one of the largest consumer product makers in the world)?<br><br>That's why when I find something I like, I stick to it. Find a pair of shoes. I buy a few pair. I don't try new toothpaste, deodorant, etc.<br><br>Each restaurant I go to, I have my usual. <br><br>My meals taken at home don't vary much.<br><br>People thought I lived a somewhat spartan life before. With AF, fewer things fill my attention. <br><br>For some reason, just taking a moment to consider the next purchase with list in hand or decision to watch a DVD just makes it less likely I will do so. No system to "minimalize" my life. It just happens.<br><br>More and more that I do doesn't really involve "choice". Something stands out, I do it.<br><br>But most of the world clamors for more "control" and "choice". Making their playlists for music. Decorating their houses over and over again. Even sex has to be "spiced" up and made new again. People are forever bored.<br><br>Wish I had this insight and method earlier. I've always suffered under too many choices.<br><br>I am hardly an alter kocker but since spring has begun, I spend most of my evenings after work having a small meal. Sit on the porch while the Oboist makes reeds and I read a story aloud or try to work a crossword together. <br><br>Evidently, we are in a rut. I hope not to get out anytime soon.<br><br>I do believe that people my age especially have lost the joyful intimacy of the familiar.</div>

<div class="content">Norman: If you prefer fewer choices I am surprised you like AF then. As I had a huge list, the number of things I could be doing was always on my mind. Now I just have a short lust of choices to which I add spontaneous things that stand out. The latter I just do without writing down.

<div class="content">I agree with Mel. Scanning 75 items, ranging from "purchase soap" to "learn Spanish, caused paralysis. Rarely did I find intuition trumping anxiety. Still, I've retained the DWM assembly line process (dating new items 31 days, repeating 7 days) while using Mel's "spontaneous things that stand out" to do things during the day.</div>

<div class="content">It's a matter of perspective Mel.  You see AF as one big list with lots of choices.  I, and I think Norm, see it as a big list with only one choice: Do the current thing or do not.  Before AF I had a number of things stuck on my mind because I didn't want to forget to do them.  Now I feel free to forget because I know a reminder is coming soon.<br><br>I think also you are saying you do spontaneous things without writing.  I do too, but I think I fare better when I don't.  Too much spontaneity leads to too many unimportant things being done.  The delay between writing and acting often mitigates the urge to do these things.<br><br>Third point: I do find a huge list is a negative because most of that list is unimportant or redundant.  It takes too much scanning to get to good stuff then.  I'm making a concerted effort to drop and merge stuff into a smaller-sized list.  I think 50 items might be a good upper limit.</div>

<div class="meta">2010-04-20 19:32</div>
<div class="content">Alan, I think the problem was (not so much with AF1) that I was holding that huge number of things in mind as I worked. I need a limited number of options in my head to feel relaxed and also productive. Thinking about the massive number of things on that list in my daily review of it made me feel like my meager efforts were pointless.<br><br>Also, doing spontaneous things doesn't mean they're unimportant. When I used an AF list, I might see "Read X book" and do that rather than cleaning up after dinner. I might also do that rather than say "Sure!" when my kids ask me to play with them. <br><br>RF, are you using the dates as drop-off dates for your tasks? I have thought about using formal expiration dates for tasks, but I seem able to do this naturally. So, if I keep redating something on Goodtodo, I just know that it needs to go.</div>

<div class="content">Choice is less of a problem now, but in the past it was all but paralyzing. Too many choices, and if I picked one too long something else would be neglected.</div>

<div class="content">Choice is only a problem if you don't make it at the right place/time.  With the standard "To Do" list you make the choice when you chose what to put on the list in the first place.  With the "standing out" lists (AF/DWM) you make the choice when it is time to act ... a point which causes the most trouble, I find.  That is when things get underfoot.  If you have too many things from which to choose, you can become paralyzed when it is time to DO.  I found it helpful to start the day scanning the AF list to cull those things that I CHOSE to do that day.  Then I would work from that subset list and find no problems knowing what to do ... they were all there written down in front of me.  I just had to start at the top and work down.  Falling off a log.<br><br>This is also illustrated by the sales example.  If you have not chosen what you want BEFORE you walk into the store, you have a problem deciding and are subject to the sales pressures of sales people.  If you decide in advance that you want a blue sweater, you don't have that problem.  You can still retain flexibility and pick the red one because the shade of blue on the shelf is not what you had in mind and the red looks better.  But since you went in with a goal (by a blue sweater) you are only dealing with one reference point ... other things are compared to that and not with each other.  IOW, you are not LOOKING for red or yellow, only blue and the other colors only come into the field of view in terms of are they better than your first choice ... blue.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mel<br>I know that we're of differing opinions about this, but I'll attempt to reveal my perspective about struggling.  Sometimes when I want to solve a problem, create something new, attain a higher level of mastery,  get a result but don't relish it's necessary process, etc., I anticipate struggle as a necessary component of the equation.  While I don't necessarily prefer the notion of struggle, I accept it as part of the process to get my result.  Ironically, the struggle fades because I've accepted it as a necessary component of getting the result I want.  The struggle instead becomes applied effort.  It also becomes courage and confidence for the next time I want something that will involve struggle.  Struggle treats me better when I befriend it.<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>struggle part two<br>As I wrote the above post, I was using my biofeedback lessons to ignore the fuzzy head created by high narcotics while simultaneously ignoring the horrible burning sensation of my damaged spinal cord and nerves.  I was taught to willfully distract from those stimuli and ramp up my focus on the results of my efforts.  True, the results will be less fine than if I wasn't struggling with the pain and narcotics, but I chose to reframe the struggles into applied/determined effort. That distracts the RAS away from the obstacles and keeps it focused on the solution.  Yeah, it's a cheap mind game.  But, in a far lesser manner, it's what I always did to get the prize...LOL!<br>vickie</div>

<div class="content">Vickie, as usual your brilliance is altogether untarnished by your brain. Wish I could say the same! You are talking about thinking differently about the to-do list. Thinking "here's my daily grind, my daily have-to, my exhausting, pointless chores" vs. "here's my challenge for the day, my push-myself-higher, do-more-than-before list" determines our success. Thank you for yet another reframe I can use. Lately I have been realizing that my effort should go into changed thinking rather than changed behavior as the latter naturally follows the former. You're an inspiration. Thanks for sharing.</div>

<div class="content">"Norman: If you prefer fewer choices I am surprised you like AF then. As I had a huge list, the number of things I could be doing was always on my mind. Now I just have a short lust of choices to which I add spontaneous things that stand out. The latter I just do without writing down. How has AF limited your choices rather than expanding them as it did for me."<br><br>Although you said that my other posts gave you some insight into my comment on this thread, I do think that this a point that I would to quickly and explicitly address.<br><br>Initially the list was staggering. My therapist began to think I had developed OCD overnight. And there was anxiety there. But as I mentioned in the other thread, when I realized I didn't have to do any of the tasks, they were just ways I saw the world maybe asking for my help, most of that anxiety went away.<br><br>My list over time has grown smaller and smaller. It is not just because I "do" more, but because I truly believe that diligent practice of AF helps to give me a more realistic view of my role in this world. The standing out process begins when making that list.<br><br>Fewer things stand out asking for my help. This makes sense to me, since I have an incredibly skewed view of my necessity and importance in the world.<br><br>Rigorous dismissal and letting those dismissed items go is a practice in humility for me.<br><br>Those often thought about fantasies, responsibilities, etc. leave and I have a bit more energy and attention to focus on how I get along better in the world. <br><br>That freer engagement in the world means my "focus" is more sharply turned toward those things which truly stand out. The glare of my willful desires and infantile fantasies just doesn't have as much room to enter the picture.<br><br>Over time as my "intuition" is practiced more, I bet AF will look less and less like a long list of tasks and lines.</div>

So why do you think that is?  <<<<br><br>I'm not sure I can speak to why lots of people do anything.  I suspect there are almost as many reasons as there are people ;-)  But if any one thing seems to be close to universal it is that people want to avoid work.  The To Do list is naked work, right in your face.  You can't fuss with it or game it ... it is just there.  You made the decision now it is time to execute and all that is left is the hard stuff ... the DOING.<br><br>In fact, I don't think that people who actually DO the To Do list struggle at all.  They might bitch and moan, but we all do that.  But to the extent that they DO the list they end the day feeling more satisfied than if they let themselves drift and just do what appeals to them at the moment.  But again, that is just my personal observation.</div>

<div class="content">Vickie, what a kind post. Your reference to scut work is inspiring me once again. There's definitely a place in my life for "just do it and get it over with." <br><br>I live on this balance beam between being a complete phony and a total over achiever. When people say, "I don't know how you do it," I think, "I'm really thankful you don't!" I've told Jacqueline before that I seem to say, "You're too hard on yourself" when I really need to say, "Shape it up!" and vice versa. But I really appreciate hearing that I'm doing well.

<div class="content">Mel,<br><br>>>>  Mike, I agree but I think there are some belief systems that get in the way of people doing things.  <<<<br><br>Yes, I don't dispute that.  But OTOH, it does not really matter what you believe if you can just DO it.  Belief can make it "hard" to do something but cannot actually STOP you. I know that as awful as any task might seem, in the end it comes down to my choice to pick up one foot and place it squarely in front of the other <repeat> until it is done ... or to just sit there and whine about how it FEELS.<br><br>That is probably why the Nike slogan appealed to some ..... it is obvious.  The game is not to try to feel good about doing things but simply to DO them.  I have been privleged to share some ideas with Learning that have helped me a great deal but the basic one is her approach to resistance.  She has planted in my mind that I have to see it as simply one more attribute of the task at hand.  So what if it hurts ... it STILL has to get done.  So if it becomes a "game" of some kind to keep your attitude focused on the tasks at hand, then it has to become that game and that's O.K.  Whatever it takes.  But the FOCUS has to be and must always be on getting it done ... not on what it takes to get it done.  (At least that is what I have culled from some of her excellent descriptions of how to work through resistance ... she might put it differently, to be sure ;-)<br><br>So, by all means change your belief system ... hell, why work against belief?  But don't let the work on belief systems get in the way of the task you set out to do.  You'll probably never really enjoy mucking the stables but once it's done it will feel so much better that you don't have it to look forward to any longer.<br><br>>>>  One thing I read years ago is the difference between those who have a neat home and those who don't is that the neat ones will clean up and put away even when they don't feel like it.

And I am not calling it "laziness", mostly because I'm not sure what that word even means ;-)  I think it is that some of us have become too soft.  Something in the water (probably the culture, actually) has made us think that we have to wait until we FEEL LIKE IT before we do anything.  Our ancestors did not have to feel like it and that is probably why we are here in the first place.  They went out and plowed the field if it was wet or dry or cold or warm or whatever ... it had to be plowed and no one else was there to plow it so they got out of the warm bed and DID IT.<br><br>As to a belief system, those who have a clean house have it that way because of what standards they hold about the way things must be.  They don't TOLERATE the same level of disorder as others so they do not HAVE that disorder.  (Or cleanliness or whatever you are focused on.)  And it is that lack of toleration that pushes them to pick things up immediately.  And, over time they have LEARNED to FEEL good about doing the same thing we feel bad about.  Feeling good about doing things FOLLOWS doing them, not the other way around.  IOW, do it and you'll feel good about doing it.</div>

<div class="content">A theory of the German psychologist Julius Kuhl attempts to separate people into two groups: state-oriented individuals who focus under stress on past, present or future states, rather than options available for action; and action-oriented individuals who focus under stress on action alternatives. <br><br>There seems to be a personality dimension of state versus action orientation: State-oriented persons on the preoccupation dimension, are those who report having persistent and uncontrollable negative emotional states after being exposed to aversive events. They tend to focus their attention on a past, present, or future state instead of focusing it on the current task. Action-oriented persons, in contrast, have a better ability to “down-regulate” the negative affect elicited by an aversive experience. <br><br>State orientation differs from the constructs of neuroticism and anxiety with regard to the way negative affect is managed: State oriented individuals are not postulated to have an increased sensitivity to negative affect or to punishment as neurotic or anxious individuals do. Instead, they have a decreased self-regulatory capacity to reduce negative affect in a self-initiated “top–down” manner once it is aroused.<br><br>If this all makes any sense, then I would draw the following conclusions regarding the impacts of writing and reading to-do lists to a person’s work or life:<br><br>For an action orientated person writing and reading to-do lists would lead to a greater awareness of choices and opportunities, increased efficiency and faster accomplishment.<br><br>For a state orientated person writing and reading to-do lists would lead to more distraction, a decrease in the ability of handling the amount of information, decreased efficiency, and a state of “feeling stalled”.</div>

<div class="content">Hey Rainer, <br><br>By Kuhl's definition, it appears that I'm schizophrenic as I have both of these orientations depending on what I'm doing - and energy levels of course.  One thing I do know is that when I'm not highly engaged in my work or in a project and that almost physical feeling of avoidance starts coming over me, there's a knee-jerk reaction to.... make a list.  Once I get grooving on the list and the orientation changes, I stop using it because it's a distraction and getting in my way.  "Waaaaa.  But it's hard" changes to "you can do hard."<br><br>So I would suggest that the opposite conclusion could be drawn?  Either way, I think his analysis is very true.<br><br>Mike, I think you're bang on about many people today and how soft we've become.   When I would come home tired after work, I could skip through and do AF "properly", hoping that maybe if I just get one thing done on this page, on the next there would be something I would "feel" like doing.  But on a weekend morning when I'd wake up raring to go, I just powered through the thing, doing anything that presented itself because I wasn't resisting doing much and wanted to literally just work through it like it was a daily to-do list. <br><br>What does "learning as I go" do that many of us don't? She plans her days (within the context of what she wants to get done in a week) because she's not playing with her head.  She focuses on her character and the kind of person she wants to be.  She had a good example in her father who taught her how to do this, as did I with my parents.  You do something because you want a result and you accept that you'll have to do whatever it takes to get there.</div>

True, the hierarchy of our values may shift contextually, but they aren't governed by the context, rather they guide us to make the best decisions and take the best actions in whatever context is created by the intersection of your goals and present or forecasted circumstances.  I was taught to go with internal motivation as my prime guiding system.  I'm grateful for that.  I never intended nor could I have ever forecasted living in a pain riddled disabled body with a fractured brain.
