<div class="content">When I was with GTD I used discreationary time to make calls or write a letter. The problem was lack of motivation then. Now when using AF I have lot of motivation but have no ability to work in different contexts because it requres all the tools by hand (as the rule for AF1 states) . So I have to work AF in a scheduled time when I have access to all the tools (phone, computer, etc). Is it a disadvantage or not?</div>

<div class="content">I'd say if you feel its a disadvantage, then it is one for you. Otherwise no. And you don't have to schedule Autofocus so you have all resources for every possible task on your list at hand. If you get to a "call x" task and don't have a phone, just move to the next task.<br><br>Other than that, I recommend using the search function of this forum, there were a lot of discussions concerning contexts in the past: <a href="http://www.markforster.net/display/Search?searchQuery=contexts&moduleId=1292867" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/display/Search?searchQuery=contexts&moduleId=1292867</a></div>

<div class="content">And if that's the last item on the page should I dismiss it or pretend I haven't seen it there :) ?</div>

<div class="content">Basically it's your choice.<br><br>If you go back about a year in the forum to the time when AF1 was current, you'll find many discussions that mull the alternatives over and over again.<br><br>Mark would perhaps ask, if that call is the last thing on the page, you probably came by that page quite often already. Why did you never do it then? Perhaps you should dismiss and review it.<br><br>Or you could switch to one of the newer systems that handle such tasks better, for example AF4 (closed list is normally larger than one page, so you have more options, and if the call is the last thing, you have the automatic dismissal and review process that gets it re-added immediately) or DWM (if you haven't made that call within 30 days, again you might want to review it).</div>

<div class="content">I had big problems with contexts when practising GTD. I was very good at sorting actions to sophisticated contexts, but none of the contexts ever got activated and the actions were left undone forever. Nowadays, I'm trying to have a "key project" which draws me towards a context. Once I'm in, there is a slight possibility that similar items get actioned too. I take them directly from the AF list which contains actions of all contexts. In this situation, it would be nice to have a filtered list at hand, but my index card system can't do that for me...<br><br>For me, the "marching deadline" and the one big list of the new DWM approach are much more important than splitting the lists into contexts.</div>

<div class="content">SInce DWM dismisses by day instead of AF4 by "nothing left to do here", context loses its relevance.  If I stick with DWM, I'm getting merging these lists, though I might use a symbol to identify more quickly which items to consider at any moment.</div>
