<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-03-9 10:18</div>
<div class="content">On the first page of this forum, we have something like 50 threads all posted to in the past 5 days. Unless you're checking in every day and glancing at each new thread, it's impossible to keep up. I'm fascinated by Autofocus and its users, would like to get more involved in the community. Sadly I don't have time to keep track of so many uncategorised discussions.<br><br>Is the time right to move this discussion to a forum with categories? It might be useful to have separate areas to discuss for example: digital, paper, the "philosophy" of autofocus, autofocus at home, autofocus at work, beginner's questions, advanced hacks and tips, and so on. Having these areas would make it easier to keep track of discussions -- and I think would also spark a wider variety of interesting discussions too.<br><br>It would also mean that newcomers to the system and site could find information they were looking for more easily. Currently I'm not sure this forum is the right place to send somebody who's just thinking about Autofocus.<br><br>I'd be happy to do some of the technical work setting up a different forum, if you (and particularly Mark) think it would be helpful. For a very easy and powerful solution, a Ning group might work well.</div>

<div class="content">In my experience that is often not very helpful.  People have to decide where to post and readers have to guess where they want to read.  On most sites which have multiple sections people tend to do most of their posting in one thread, regardless of what the subject is.<br><br>I think it is too much overhead for not much payback.  Beside, this might be a solution looking for a problem.  I'm finding it not that difficult to just read the most recent posts from the threads sorted to the top by date.</div>

<div class="content">David:<br><br>I've thought about using one of the many forums which are available. But I actually agree with Mike. I know it's very tempting to want everything neatly categorised so no one ever has to repeat anything - but the reality is that's not how things work in the real world.<br><br>The real point of this forum is that people can come on it and ask questions and get virtually immediate answers. That's what most people do anyway, even on Forums with categories.</div>

<div class="content">Hi all,<br><br>I'm having the same problems as David, maybe even worse, as I can only look at the forum on weekdays, so today am trying to catch up with everything from the weekend.<br><br>Having said that, I also agree with Mark that categorizing the forums will be a nightmare to follow.<br><br>I'm waiting for Mark's other suggestion to become possible - for the forum to be available by RSS. That will really make my life so much easier. Also, let's be honest, AF is new at the moment, I'm guessing the use of the forum will calm down at some point ... from my point of view, I'm hoping that isn't too far away, but I guess from Mark's pov, it would be better later, as that shows that people are taking AF on.<br><br>So no answers from me, but if an RSS feed (or some sort of email notification) does become possible, count me in.<br><br>Donna</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for your comments. If the forum exists primarily to provide answers to questions then it makes sense to just have one big discussion. I was thinking more of a community of autofocus users, with the opportunity to talk about things that are not simply quick Q & As. It would make it easier to have very nichey discussions going on, e.g. AF for learning a new skill -- something I'd like to discuss, but is likely not to move fast enough to stay on the front page here, and would thus slip off the radar.</div>

<div class="content">What is a Ning group, please?</div>
<h2>Reply by David Barnes</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-03-9 13:46</div>
<div class="content">It's a more complex kind of discussion community, where you can discuss different topics, share photos, send personal messages to other members, keep a blog, and so on.  Here's an example: <a href="http://aecnetwork.ning.com/" rel="nofollow">http://aecnetwork.ning.com/</a></div>

<div class="content">I completely agree that it's very hard to keep up with everything, so I don't even attempt to, but would like to. It's also difficult to decide where to post or find anything without combing through massive amounts of material. I don't know what the solution is, but I would like to see some different arrangement.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-03-9 14:28</div>
<div class="content">What makes the forum especially hard to read is that a lot of threads keep changing their topic in the course of the discussion. If you remember having read something, but you don't know in which thread, and it's buried inside a thread with a completely different subject line, it's very difficult to find. The search function doesn't help much with that.<br><br>In many forums, a thread will then be split by the moderator and the new subject made its own thread under a new subject line. Mark, maybe you could adopt this practice? <br>OTOH, this will increase the number of threads even more, of course.</div>
<h2>Reply by Dm</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-03-9 14:28</div>
<div class="content">Having the most recent posts at top instead of bottom would save me a bit of time.<br><br>I think that there are a number of natural categories. Sometimes, I'd choose to just look in a specific category; sometimes at the more general discussion. On forums I run, there's never been a tendency for everyone to post in one option - I think that's a question of category choices that are meaningful to posters. It is certainly a problem I've seen elsewhere.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-03-9 16:27</div>
<div class="content">Let's be quite clear what we are talking about here. There are 7,836 posts on this forum altogether. Over this weekend there were 150 and there have already been 40 today as of 4.25 pm (UK Time).<br><br>Does anyone really think that having 150 messages over a weekend in an RSS feed is going to be an improvement?<br><br>Or that having, say, 10 categories is going to help anyone follow 7,836 post more efficiently?<br><br>The truth is that there is far too much traffic on this forum for anyone to be able to keep track of it all, and frankly anyone who tries to do so is taking on an impossible job.<br><br>The great advantage of this forum is that the "hot" topics are always at the front of the list. If you can't find what you want by using the search box, then start a new topic.</div>

<div class="content">Having said the above, if anyone wants to start up a discussion forum for Autofocus then I am happy to put a link on the AF instructions page, and I will do the same for Mel's Yahoo Discussion Group.<br><br>Which reminds me, I also need to put a link to the Autofocus Group on Facebook.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br>I didn't mean that I don't know how to start a thread.  What I meant was that it's too hard to find a topic that I might want to join in with on a topic of interest to me, rather than starting a brand new topic.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-03-9 18:18</div>
<div class="content">So, in a way, the way this forum works reflects the way AF works: <br>- Just one list. <br>- No categories. <br>- Divided in pages. <br>- You look around, waiting what's attracting your interest.<br><br>I guess that's OK, isn't it? :-)<br><br></div>
<h2>Reply by David Barnes</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-03-9 18:21</div>
<div class="content">AndreasE that is an interesting point. :) The main difference is that my AF list is mine alone, while this list is shared. I would enjoy an easy way to browse around and find topics and people who are interesting to me. This might not be the topics that attract the most responses from everybody.<br><br>If anybody else out there agrees with me, join my ning group! <a href="http://autofocusgld.ning.com/" rel="nofollow">http://autofocusgld.ning.com/</a></div>

<div class="content">Hi David<br><br>I personally only really have the time to go to one or two places - keeping up with this forum keeps me pretty busy and enables me to concentrate on what is current on the site.  I've had some thoughts about the FAQ's as updating them is becoming a pretty mammoth task - will hopefully update soon.</div>

<div class="content">David W: If you have limited time and this forum serves your purposes then stick with it. That doesn't have to stop other people discussing Autofocus and related topics elsewhere when they want to. I can't imagine that adding more places where discussion is possible will make this forum any less useful, especially as more people are discovering Autofocus every day.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-03-11 11:45</div>
<div class="content">One thing's for sure - the traffic on this forum isn't reduced by there being other places on the net to discuss AF. I checked this forum last at 6.38 p.m. yesterday and it's now 11.40 a.m. (UK time). In that short period there have been 101 new postings!</div>

<div class="content">I wonder how many of the 10,000 posts are covering the same five to ten questions, and whether future traffic would be significantly reduced if there was some way to stick a topic on each of these at the top of the topics list.<br><br>ChristineB, what do you think?<br><br>In any case, it's good to know that we're not expected to look before asking. (Though I suspect that many readers won't know this.)<br><br>(This is more like a multi user noguchi with a very large number of records than an autofucus list set. As a filing system, it doesn't really work. As a running conversation it works fine)<br><br>Someone once set up a wiki, I think.

<div class="content">Hi Will<br><br>Although this forum doesn't work in the same way as many other forums it does have a good search facility but you do have to have an idea of the correct words to look for.   The FAQ's post that I did is quite out of date and I have some ideas about updating it more easily and how to make it more accessible but I want to discuss that with Mark first.  He is currently spending some time with his daughter so it will probably be a couple of weeks.<br><br>As you know the posts are in order of last post date so will always be in noguchi format (albeit without the envelopes!) which as you say is good for a running conversation.  Keeping up with everything for the FAQ's is not so easy - and including the post  titled [] [] [] [] [] [] etc. will definitely be a challenge :-)  At the moment it's a case of watch this space ......... :-)</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Christine.<br><br>I have found the search OK for anything in the first few lines of a post, but this is by no means everything.

In fact, I'm sure we'll feel something indefinable is missing when your ideas come on stream and we can just look up the answers.<br><br>Are you referring to Klopot's Nail Emporium?

<div class="content">I think most threads don't actually change much: the first few on the front page are the ones that get lots of activity, but the ones on the second and subsequent pages are fairly static.  If you try and keep up with the latest posts, you will be spending a lot of time re-reading the start of the thread and scrolling to the end to find the one new post.<br><br>What I am doing is I am reading threads from the second page.  I get to read the entire discussion, without having to check the same thread several times.  The information is just as valuable when it is two or three weeks old as when it has been just posted.  There tend to be only a few (somewhere between one and ten) threads per last posting time.  Generally, I feel like I am not getting any further behind.  It suits me!<br><br>The only disadvantage is that I know if I reply to a thread I am resurrecting an old thread, which means I don't contribute very often.</div>
