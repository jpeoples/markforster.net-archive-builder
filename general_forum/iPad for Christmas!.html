<div class="content">My dh surprised me with an iPad as an early Christmas present.  Anyone using one?  What are your favorite productive (or not!) apps?</div>

<div class="content">Merry Christmas!<br><br>I have had one since this summer and it replaced my computer at school...<br>Productivity is different for everybody, it would help to know what you currently use to be productive. The thing itself is a monster productivity machine if you let it be.<br><br>One of my favorite apps is MindMeister which is a Brainstorming app.<br>There is a web site where your maps are stored and accessible and even sharable with live updates so many people can work on it at once.</div>

<div class="content">Well, I'm using toodledo to run AF4R (and I have used it for DWM as well).  I use Keynote and Pages for content creation- a no brainer for me because I use them on my laptop as well, so there's not even any conversion going on.  (Google Docs are supposed to be editable via Google Mobile Real Soon Now, but I haven't checked to see if that change has rolled out yet.)  Plaintext for simple text editing and Dropbox (Plaintext syncs with dropbox).</div>

<div class="content">Hi Erika,<br><br>I've also just recently got my pre-owned iPad 16GB WiFi (yesterday actually). So, now I'm a 3gadget man (mobile, tablet, notebook), and future 3os man (android, iOS, winxp). So applications like Toodledo that works on web-based and iOS native client, is of interest to me. Look forward to more suggestions.<br><br>Will be trying out that Toodledo on my iPad, to see whether it'll do better than current DWM.xls on notebook.</div>

<div class="content">Hi,<br><br>I recieved a Galaxy Pad for christmas.<br>I will now use my new tool for my todo. <br>Right now I use virtual.nu as "notebook" for my task todo.<br>AF1 is the method I use.<br><br>Anyone running AF on any Pad ? How do you do ?<br><br>/Henrik</div>

<div class="content">Hello Henrik,<br><br>During my two week break back home in the UK, I have tried out demo iPad and Galaxy Pad in a local phone shop.<br><br>I am very impressed with the Galaxy Pad, and it seemed more people tried that than the iPad.  Why?  I reckon it's the more convenient 7" form factor.<br><br>So I'm VERY tempted in the GT and would be interested in how your use of it goes.  However, I think I will hold back still until a viable handwriting capability (with active digitiser pen like most current convertible tablet notebooks, eg Portege M700) appears.  Like you, I want the tablet/slate to replace most of my handwritten notebooks, but not all.<br><br>The HP Slate 500 seems to have been delayed further. so maybe CES this month will have some more interesting slates which will hopefully appear and not vanish like in 2010.</div>

<div class="content">Hi,<br><br>I was testing Ipad before I pick the Galaxy Tab.<br>Galaxy Tab is much smaller. <br>As an indication it fit into my backpocket on my jeans.<br><br>Some quick comments.<br><br>Any tab will not remove the use of laptops<br><br>Why I pick the Galaxy Tab<br>1- Small so easy to bring with you <br>1a- Small so you can write with both tumbs when on<br>2- Big enough to write and surf on <br>3- I can call and send SMS from it.<br>Maybe I will decrease the size of my main phone - HTC Desire today -<br>4- Works pretty well with my use of virtual.nu ( Ipad works good to )<br><br><br><br>What you will not get with the Galaxy Tab is.<br>1- All Special apps that company build.<br>2- The Cool factor.<br><br>I will comment after 30 days how I use my pad if you want.<br>30 days because most of my friends with new tools/toys stop to use them before 30 days :)<br><br>Would be nice to know how Ipad  / pad user use them for AF</div>

<div class="content">You're right, Henrik, a tablet/slate will not remove the usefulness of notebooks.<br><br>I want a tab to supplement my notebook, or notebooks.  Leave the notebooks at home and office, unless absolutely necessary, use the slate in between and as a notepad on the desk and at home.<br><br>Essential files and data would be synchronised via Dropbox so that all three devices - work notebook (or desktop), home notebook (or desktop) and slate would have current data once they are connected to Dropbox.  And yes, I would also take back-ups onto an external HDD.<br><br>I don't want the 'cool' factor, just something that will work for me!</div>

<div class="content">Synchronizing phone/tablet/notebook is much easier when all use same/similar OS (such as Android/Linux or iOS). Things are more interesting when you use three different OS (such as Android+iOS+Windows). Looks like I'll be going that way, when an Android 2.3 Gingerbread device lands on my shore. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi,<br><br>Yes Dropbox is the perfect tool for syncs.<br>I use Dropbox and Springpad a lot. <br><br>Just want to clarify that the wide of the Tab fit into my pocket but it is higher than the pocket.<br><br>/Henrik</div>

<div class="content">Sabre32: yes, things do get more interesting!  I'm hoping a suitable Windows device will emerge this year, if it doesn't and Android achieves proper handwriting capability, then life will indeed get more interesting.  Before any iPad users comment, yes, I know it does have a degree of inking capability, but I'm going to remain 'un-cool'.<br><br>Henrik: thanks for that, and I have enough travel pockets to carry the 7" form factor easily.  Thanks as well for that heads-up on Springpad, looks interesting.</div>

<div class="content">Hi,<br><br>My setup is :<br>1- Dropbox for my files and document to keep<br>2. Springpad to remember stuffs.<br>3- Virtual.nu for my task todo. I have a special setup with Gmail that makes me do AF1 or AF4 easily. ( I can explain in a thread if you want )<br><br>Back home after some holiday .... Real life start soon :)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Henrik,<br><br>I might take you up on the Virtual.nu/Gmail setup later.  BTW, my email address is rhj1947ATgmail.com.<br><br>From your previous post, I take it you don't use Springpad for AF.  I can see the potential for AF with Springpad, but as always each of us must find and use what works for us as individuals.</div>

<div class="content">Hi,<br><br>There is some sites talking about Springpad and time management if you search on internet.<br><br>I will post a thread about virtual.nu</div>

<div class="content">I've been playing around with Springpad during the day.<br><br>Likes:<br>- concept<br>- layout<br>- adaptability<br>- mobile/smartphone versions available<br><br>Dislikes<br>- site slow to respond sometimes, goes offline<br>- I don't use Android, yet, would be interesting to try a Windows Mobile version, but then this might be the catalyst to move to an Android device (and a Galaxy Tab!).<br><br>Potential<br>I have not yet tried the 'Board', but it may be of use for those that want to use a Kanban approach.<br>- developers should allow for off-line use (limited)</div>
