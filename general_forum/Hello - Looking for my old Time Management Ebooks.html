<div class="content">Hello,<br><br>It has been awhile since I have posted.  Unfortunately my computer crashed and I lost many files.  Years ago I published two ebooks on time management called the Simple Guide to Time Management and the Ultra Simple Guide to Time Management.  I know several of the people on the forum bought them and I sent a complimentary copy to Mark.  If anyone still has them would you be so kind as to send me a copy to ravegg@gmail.com<br><br>Thanks very much<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for looking, unfortunately that is not it.  It is a 10 or so page pdf and I honestly can't remember the site I sold it from.</div>

<div class="content">A while back you made at least one of those guides public and I went back to look for it.  The link was there in these forums but its target was not found.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Gerry,<br>I looked around my computer file system and cannot yet locate a copy. I too switched computers. I will continue to keep it in mind as I encounter the corners of my file system and will come back to this thread for your email if I find it. Sorry I don't have better news!</div>

<div class="content">Thanks to everyone who searched for these.  I was able to get back the original pdf of one and a link to the test of the other from the wayback machine.<br><br>I will be revisiting these methods in my work and I have posted them as pdf files so anyone can grab them for free if you wish.  The links are here, thanks again.<br><br><a href="http://undergroundguidetosuccess.blogspot.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://undergroundguidetosuccess.blogspot.com/</a></div>
