<div class="content">The rules below are how I ran my project system before I got into SuperFocus.  It's less integrated, but works well with any AF system, including DWM.  <br><br>	1. Keep your AF list as you always have, and have a separate collection of project pages.<br>	2. You may take any AF task and put it into a project page.<br>	3. At any time you may insert "Work on Project X" into AF.<br>	4. To work on Project X:<br>Get out the project,  Define new tasks, work some tasks, or add project tasks to AF, by writing as "Task --> X".  Put the page away when done.<br><br>5. Later when your work on Task --> X, in your AF list:<br>Work task as normal.  When you finish Task, you may wish to grab another task from Project X, or add "Work on project X" to AF.  Enter these as new tasks.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks to sindikat, I discovered Christine B had essentially the same idea 18 months ago:<br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/735044#post743484" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/735044#post743484</a><br><br>I agree with Christine, that the system just sort of naturally evolved out of using AutoFocus.</div>

<div class="content">Alan,<br>I use very similar system to manage my projects with DWM.xls. Basically I have almost every task in DWM.xls links to its project text file. Some project text files are generic (eg. health.txt, contacts.txt), some are agenda files with persons initials (eg .EA.txt, .NF.txt), and some with specific projects (eg. budget2011.txt, CCTV.txt).<br><br>When doing a task, I'll click the links to open the project text file; and log done items, refer/do related project tasks or update project info.</div>

<div class="content">Alan, <br><br>I am sure other have benefitted from your development work and sharing, I know I have, even if I do not implement all the ideas you have put forward,  Thanks very much for your initiative,<br><br>I am interested in your OneNote treatment for Work tasks, I have OneNote 2010 from my upgrade to Office 2010.  I had a look at your flick shot (?) yesterday.<br><br>From what I can see from the photo, you use the ability to move individual tasks around (as OneNote pages) to section and/or notebooks as required, correct?<br><br>I wonder if you would mind sending me a clipping of your OneNote page example to rhj1947ATgmail.com?  I'd like to see the 'layout' of the various elements without being able to go into details, the web page used earlier is too much (not enough?) for my eyes.<br><br>I dabbled with SF, as I do when a promising variant emerges, but am currently back in manual DWM2 per nuntym.  However, I have found that my Personal list is much bigger than my Work list which may or may not be a good thing - what am I missing?!<br><br>I think I'd like to have a go at using OneNote for Work only because of the flexibility and tracking Outlook items as well (I sometimes convert emails into tasks in Outlook, but these reside in Outlook and I'm not good at managing them within Outlook, much better in AF/DWM).  Like you, I may prefer to retain paper and pen<br><br>When a decent slate comes out for Windows 7 or with decent handwriting capability, I would be tempted to have everything in OneNote, but maybe that's not a good idea and can wait anyway.  And no, I will not be going for the iPad, too big, 7" or 8.9" is better for my purposes.<br><br>Once again, thanks for all your valuable contributions.</div>

<div class="content">Hi all. Dear Alan, this system already exist and it's GTD. ;-)) :-))...<br><br>The question is only about the treatment of the task and in the philosophy of the 2 systems<br><br>1. about the treatment. Once you have your project you have tasks to do.<br>With GTD you choose the next actionable task and decides the options. <br>And you do things by contexts. ie &Call and so on...<br>With AF there are no context and no next action. All is grouped together so you can to do the by contexts or not as the tasks "stand at you". <br><br>2. The philosophy is different too. GTD is a precise methodology with a precise way of doing things and an exhaustive collect of everything. the master word of gtd could be CONTROL. AF is more an artisanal systems which try to let your brain manage your stuff on a focus area which doesn't mean an exhaustive collect. His master word could be FEEL...<br><br>Anyway, both system are good and efficient. For my part i now use GTD but when i am fed up of working by contexts and controlling things I use AF. I just created a new context call @Autofocus which is a kind of guideline of my today's tasks. And when things becomes really unmanageable i come back to gtd with a good  midweek review. But i alway keep my weekly review and follow GTD rules. <br><br>Finally things are quiet simple. It depends on the amount of tasks and projects. <br>If you are like me with a mountain of things to do which oblige you to choose the best valuable task to succed then GTD is better. IF sometime things becomes quiet so you can use AF. <br><br>But the principle are the same. If you need projects then you need to separate projects from a list of things to do and make frequent come back from one to the other to do things and create next things to do.</div>

<div class="content">Jupiter, I think my situation is much like yours with many varied things to do. But I tried very hard to do GTD and gave it up because it's too intricate in structure. And because I found AutoFocus. I've been meaning to write a detailed comparison of GTD and AutoFocus for a long time.  My summary: With AutoFocus I achieve all the goals of GTD, without the complexity, yet work efficiently. But keep doing what works!</div>

<div class="content">For more understanding of my use of OneNote, see <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/903819." target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/903819.</a>  Also the Oct 4 post.  <br><br>That's from one year ago and nothing changed except instead of AF4 backlog and open, I have AF1 never ending list. And instead of Maybe Later I have many project sections which are all maybe-later.</div>

<div class="content">@Alan i think it would be interesting to make a real comparison about GTD vs Autofocus. <br>just to answer i had a lot of difficulty to follow gtd method until I decided because of AF to put everything on closed lists with one file per page. For the moment i use .txt files. It's indeed like on paper for me. Even taskpaper was more difficult to use because of the numbers of element. <br>Excel was a washout too because this time, of notes i needed sometime to add on my projects. <br><br>Finaly I made projects apart contexts and af for doing things, check list. <br>As all was ready because of my precedent tried (taskpaper, omnifocus, autofocus, DWM, and superfocus) it tooks me a little time and clered the elements. <br><br>I noticed that every software blocks my creativity i thought it was because of the digital way but it is the system itself wich blocks me. It's sad because I finaly found a good way to use omnifocus. But finally little .txt notes are incredibly more easy and efficient. <br><br>About Onenote the link doesn't works :(</div>

<div class="content">Jupiter said about "project sytem" ...<br><< this system already exist and it's GTD >><br><br>GTD *separates* Projects from its NextActionTasks.<br>AF/DWM *mix* Projects, NextActionTasks and OtherTasks in one main list.<br><br>GTD *separates* Capture, Process, Do, Review into distinct steps.<br>AF/DWM *mix* Capture/Process/Do/Review into little&often steps in one main list.<br><br>GTS is *modal/rigid*<br>AF/DWM is "autofocus" ;-)<br><br>Before AF/DWM I was on GTD for about a year, and I tend to get lost in Process/Do steps, and missed doing Review step. In AF/DWM, the Review step gets done for each task as it's needed.</div>

<div class="content">I think you nailed it, sabre.  Of course it does leave a GTD person wonder how anyone can be productive while completely disorganized, but clearly GTD and AF are different animals. One thing though: <br><br>>GTD *separates* Projects from its NextActionTasks.<br>>AF/DWM *mix* Projects, NextActionTasks and OtherTasks in one main list.<br><br>I think this project system can separate projects from next actions like GTD. The other differences from AF remain.</div>

<div class="content"><< this project system can separate projects from next actions like GTD >><br>Yes, if you allow AF/DWM/SF so. As mentioned elsewhere, to counter separation I tend to either mention NextActions in a Project item or mention Project in a NextAction item. For example of a BusControlCentre project:<br>"Work on BCC (JD for AM, update PMR)"<br>"Call EA on last [BCC] progress meeting"</div>
