<div class="content">This description uses weekly as the example. I use the same method for monthly, seasonally and annually. It uses too much paper for daily. It's actually a variation on AF1, but using one list per frequency. Each list is a page or context in the AF book, or however you handle contexts.<br><br>Start with the ideal frequency. Tasks that fall between lists go on the faster list if they must be done on time (clean fish tank). Tasks that can slide go on either the faster or slower list. The system will let you know if you're too optimistic.<br><br>Like AF, load the list by throwing anything at it, one task per line. Don't worry about the order. If you can remember the last time you did it, write it down.<br><br>When it's time to do weekly tasks (when you turn to that page in your AF book, or reach the "check weekly list" in your daily checklist), quickly look at the entire list, just as in AF, then do the one that stands out. The date-last-done may affect which one stands out. Ones that must be done on time will stand out.<br><br>When you do the task, cross it off the old line and write it on a new line, with today's date as date-last-done. Add notes for next time if you like.<br><br>If you don't finish the task, leave it on the old line and record there what progress you made, with today's date. Consider making it two shorter tasks.<br><br>Eventually, the tasks will be sorted by date-last-done, so you only have to review the first part of the list. At this point, if you have a new task either do it immediately then add it at the bottom, or put it on a post-it near the oldest task so you see it first. That way you only review the top (older) part of the list.<br><br>If something hangs around for a long time without being done, consider moving it to a slower list. On the other hand, if you're temporarily busier than usual, leave it on the weekly list.<br><br>When the page is full, start a new one in whatever way you currently handle new locations or contexts. You will refer to the list often, so it should be easy to get to.<br><br>I'm not sure how often to apply the dismissal rules from Mark's systems. Maybe every month apply it to the weekly list and every season apply it to the monthly list. "Move to slower list" is an additional dismissal option.</div>

<div class="content">I like this!<br><br>Working strict AF1, I've been writing non-date-critical recurring items as follows:<br>"check porch lights since 11 Aug"<br><br>Date-critical items are in my OmniFocus software, and a few others are still on my dashboard. It would be nice to have everything in one place.<br><br>New AF1 task:<br>"try Cricket's recurring task scheme"</div>

<div class="content">I found just putting them on the active/open AF page with a date due or last done left too many pages in limbo.</div>

<div class="content">Cricket:<br><br>Why not just put them in Outlook Tasks (or equivalent) with a recurring reminder?</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br>There are several reasons I don't use the computer.<br><br>Turning on the computer is usually followed by hours online. Writing in a notebook is usually followed by seeing and doing the next task or spending time with my family.<br><br>Seeing all my weekly (or monthly) tasks on one page gives me a better feel for whether I'm keeping up with the goal.<br><br>Searching for a good program (I don't have Outlook), is an effective form of procrastination. I know this from experience, having tried five. Most set recurring tasks by the calendar; it's always on Monday, even if I last did it on Wednesday. Others don't distinguish between weekly and monthly tasks.</div>

<div class="content">Variations:<br><br>If you want to do something twice in a month, make two entries, just label them A and B. I like to stand in my kitchen until I find something not on the regular list twice a month.<br><br>Or, especially if you want to do it even more often, put the date done on the right as before, but don't cross off the line. Only cross off the line and rewrite when two (or more) dates are on the line. That way it stays near the top of the list for longer. I use it for my daily-and-often list.</div>
