<div class="content">Hello I am testing a new way to try being more efficient with my AF list.<br><br>Could you give me your advices about the following ? <br><br>I noticed the back log can be very difficult to deal with. So I erased it and replaced it. <br><br>I noticed that there are things I ought to do, things I may do, things i someday will do, things I dont really know at all if i will do them or not, and things unfinished or to follow, and things to follow in the future....<br><br>Then I did this on taskpaper for the new ipad will come very soon (i think on february) and i want to buy one. <br><br>here is how it looks like :<br>NEW:<br>MUST DO:<br>MAY DO :<br>DON'T KNOW :<br>SOMEDAY DO :<br>UNFINISHED:<br>TICKLER:<br><br>What do you think about this way of doing things?  Have you tried such a things ? <br>What was the result ?<br><br>Thanks to all.</div>

<div class="content">Occasionally it helps to pull out hot mustdo items. It's fine to pull out the much-later items. More than that seems confusing.</div>

<div class="content">Jupiter,<br><br>Since you're going to be using TaskPaper, why don't you just tag the tasks with those words. Then, you can always filter on the keyword and all the associated tasks will appear.<br><br>This will enable to test your idea without monkeying around with dividing the list. <br><br>Matt</div>

<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>Have you considered using the Gatekeeper System (GKS)?<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1384353" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1384353</a><br><br>Making your system as complex as you think you can handle it is I think a recipe for resistance and procrastination.  Rather, I say make it as simple as you can get away with (and I say that from past stupidity and impulsiveness! ^___^).<br><br>Now I just consider two types of tasks: (1) tasks I must finish ASAP, and (2) the rest of them.  The first type goes to the Gatekeeper System.  The second goes to my SAF list.  I just do a review every evening to know what I will place in the GKS Post-it to start off the day.  A review in the morning can also suffice.<br><br>God bless!</div>

<div class="content">I'm actually clearing a backlog for Jan. today and my plan was more along the suggestions of Smileypete.  I'm taking a page of paper and beginning to go through my backlog.  I've got the following categories in mind-<br><br>Nevermind - In the review process, I'm giving myself the ability to just remove it altogether.  It might have seemed like a good idea but now it is not.  Adios.<br><br>Someday Down the Road - What was listed was either too large of a project to get started due to family, work, school or my main computer going down.  I don't want to forget the task or project so it will go here.<br> <br>Dream Bin - This is what I call my pile of story ideas and bits of creativity.  <br><br>Nope. It's Important - I will take the ones in this category and place them back on my AF list.  They do need done and they just need to be rescaled further down the "quick and often" scale.<br><br>I'll do most of this mentally and any items that fall into "Someday" and Dream Bin get put down on a list in the notebook called "Backlog."  (I'm actually thinking of calling it something else fun but not sure yet.)<br><br>Final Step - A repeatable task on the AF list that says, "Check the Backlog"  When I do this I will review the Backlog again and possible bring items over to the main list if space in my life has opened up.<br><br>And, hopefully, that will do the trick.  As for Dismissad items during the normal AF process moving forward? I'm considering them part of the Backlog process for the monthly review only.  All other times they function normally.</div>

<div class="content">@2mc "Since you're going to be using TaskPaper, why don't you just tag the tasks with those words.

The idea of  Gatekeeper System (GKS) is interesting it may force me to focus on my most important goals and easy to implement on taskpaper may be a @mustdo tag. I gona try.</div>

<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>Jupiter, I do have to warn you though that tagging is not enough: you must have a commitment to give the @mustdo tasks more attention than the other tasks, and this commitment must be integrated into the system (I think that is the reason why AF4R did not sit well with me, as there is no compelling rule to process the "Unfinished" tasks; moreover, I think that is why Alan's AF4R is working, because his system encourages him to cycle in the "Active" tasks more frequently).  That is the principle of both 2mc (Matt)'s Task Flagging and my GKS.  In 2mc's system, you must work on all of the @mustdo tasks before you could tackle the other tasks.  In the GKS, you must work on at least one @mustdo task before you can work on the others in an AF page...but since you encounter the list of @mustdo tasks everytime you turn a page, you are forced to do those @mustdo tasks "little and often."<br><br>So think of a way to give priority to you @mustdo items, and you're all set ^___^<br><br>God bless!</div>

<div class="content">@nuntym there could be another solution. If tasks are either unfinished nor must do items I may do an single colum AF4 list put check checkbox e in front of all item unfinished and high line in red the most important task i must do or urgent. I could take another page for all task I do regularly (check emails, read war and peace (lol) ) <br><br>Then  the system would be much simplest and would avoir reporting tasks unless they are absolutely necessary. I could then high line in yellow what is dismissed and see in a glance what is important and urgent and what is dismissed.<br><br>It is just an idea. May be it could work and save my intuition.</div>

<div class="content">BTW, Jupiter,<br><br>You can use keywords to highlight text in TaskPaper. But, you'll have to create it yourself. The instructions are the Wiki site of TaskPaper. <br><br>Back when I was using TaskPaper, I used @hl to highlight a task.<br><br>Matt</div>
