<div class="content">When I go through my AF list I tend to choose the most plesant tasks to do. The most important one (and they're the most tough as usual) are being dismissed. Maybe my subconsious wants me to do only plesant stuff? :) How about you?</div>

<div class="content">Eugene,<br><br>That has not been my experience. Are you using the Little and Often Principle?<br><br>That made all the difference for me.</div>

<div class="content">Sure I do. I think of going back to GTD as I want a higher level overview of my activities. I think it's possible to appy AF principles to GTD lists. Have to think about that.</div>

<div class="content">Eugene,<br><br>A lot of us on this forum experience that sort of thing and other issues - Alan B's pile of papers problem resonated with me, I'm doing a MASSIVE decluttering project at home and in my office at present.<br><br>Reading between the lines of many posts, I identify others who like me have procrastination problems and a desire for perfection (the two are probably interrelated, at least in my case).<br><br>When faced with getting going, I now deploy the "salami" technique which you can see on a recent thread of mine, A Slice of Action (I think).  This gets one going and can be used for little and often circumstances.<br><br>When I face up to what has to be done, I start with 5 minutes on the kitchen timer, then reset it and add five minutes each reset, ie 5 + 10 + 15 etc.  The last time I used this was last weekend and I found I was doing in excess of three hours in one session made up of the time resets.<br><br>Works for me.</div>
