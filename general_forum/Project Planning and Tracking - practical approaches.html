<div class="content">Hi all,<br><br>I have been wondering about integrating AutoFocus with my way of project scheduling and planning and would be interested in reading about other people's ways of connecting these two levels of effective "life management".<br><br>Since I am a highly visual person and not that much a "numbers person", I have been using Outlook for visually outlining projects against a timeline.  This helped me catch overcommitment early on and also provided a framework for me to track my progress on a project against the schedule.  The way I did this,  was to break up a project into 1.5 hour blocks and spread them out over my Outlook calendar until they totalled the allocated time for the project in question.  This went together with my approach of blocking out time in advance for project work over the next few weeks.  <br><br>While this has clearly helped me to visualize bigger projects, many long-term projects that depended on regular or not-regular smaller tasks, repetetive smaller tasks, etc. often fell through the cracks.  <br><br>One aspect of AF that I love and that helps me tremendously is the ease with which I can keep the system running.  Not much organizing, not much messing with priorities, task groups, etc.  Everything simply goes into my master AF list - small tasks, single tasks, repetetive tasks, projects, ideas… everything!<br><br>But what about tracking project progress?  What about being able to complete work for my clients as fast as possible (I do freelance work) with promised deadlines they can rely on?  So far my Outlook schedule did help with that, but now I feel it would mess with working with AF, since I'd be pre-planning project work, whereby I would lose much of the focus, freedom, and flexibility AF provides.<br><br>I am sure there are other people using AF who have to provide clients/customers/bosses with deadline estimates and who have to make sure they meet these deadlines.  How do you combine AF with project planning and tracking?  Would love to hear your thoughts on this.<br><br>Kind regards,<br><br>Joshua<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Joshua<br><br>You should find the following thread helpful on this subject.  I also did a fairly lengthy post in that thread which covers some aspects of time tracking which may help<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/636447" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/636447</a><br><br>The FAQ's post at <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/645945" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/645945</a> will also give you links to some of the other project related threads.<br><br>A lot of project work, needs monitoring outside of AF, by use of a schedule or other project system but the Outlook set up you describe sounds similar to that produced automatically by software called Above & Beyond.  It is the best Time Tracking software I have found and can also be used to produce billing information.  You can find details at <a href="http://www.1soft.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.1soft.com/</a><br> <br><br></div>

<div class="content">Christine,<br><br>Thank you for the links.  I had read those posts already, but they do not seem to talk much about the planning and future scheduling side of project work.  Tracking the time I work on projects for billing purposes is no problem, I simply use PayMo and get everything I need.  What I would like to find is a way to utilize AF's strengths for project work.  Because if I need to pre-schedule time to work on these larger projects in order to be able to predict a realistic deadline, I lose the benefits of AF in relationship with them and the time I spend on them.<br><br>If that is the only way it can be done - fine.  But isn't it the declared goal of AF to catch everything, as far as the task level is concerned?  Isn't AF supposed to help me make decisions that work towards keeping realistic deadlines while maintaining balance?  How would I set these deadlines w/o leaving AF and using time scheduling?  Because otherwise AF would - as it was suggested on this forum before - only work for that "special free time" outside of strict project work.  Or am I missing something?<br><br>Joshua</div>

<div class="content">Hi Joshua<br><br>From what you say it sounds as if you yourself are responsible for the deadline - i.e. you tell the client when you expect to complete the work as opposed to them telling you when they want it by.  If that is the case then you will have obviously devised a system to facilitate that process.  What you need to be sure of in those cases is that the deadlines set are realistic and achievable.  Sometimes that means looking at the hidden influences on setting those deadlines (e.g. Company x will take two weeks - I will do it in one).  <br><br>If however you are being provided with the deadline by the client then there is the added fact that your subconscious will recognise it as an imposed deadline and that may increase the resistance to the task.  Whilst resistance is not something you have mentioned I think it is important to recognise that one of the benefits of AF is that it does enable you (or even force you) to look at why you feel a certain way about things and resistance will of necessity have an influence on actioning any progress. <br><br>Assuming that you have your deadlines in place, by whatever means, it sounds as if you know in advance the time requirement for each project.  Under your previous system you scheduled time blocks which clearly worked well for some projects but left gaps for others.  Hope I have understood you correctly?<br><br>I have found that there are two ways to deal with projects in AF.  For larger projects I would keep a separate list of tasks within my project management system and task it within AF as "project x"  On the basis that under AF I can spend the amount of time I feel like, all that would be needed for monitoring would be to record the total time spent each time I actioned that project.  The list of tasks relating to that project can be treated as a separate AF list whilst working that project, similar to as if it were a separate location.  That retains the flexibility of AF within the structure of the project, and also allows AF to identify the correct working time.<br><br>For other projects I would have a similar task list but would be more likely to include the indiviual tasks from that list within AF.  The project task list would be part of my project management system but the tasks themselves handled within AF.  For time monitoring I would just notate my project task list with the time spent on each item as I actioned it.  that list would then form a support document for my time and billing.<br><br>Whilst the system is settling down you may feel that you are not seeing each project frequently enough as you work through your pages.  I think that is something that will balance out over time and you may decide to schedule some time blocks in the interim.  The important thing to bear in mind is that your subconscious naturally knows the tasks required, and the deadlines, and so things will stand out - if they don't then there WILL be a reason, hence my comments above about resistance.<br><br>So, to summarise, if you analyse your projects into separate task lists, you can then use those lists within AF, either as part of a project time block or as individual tasks.  The lists themselves can form the basis and support documentation for your time recording.<br><br>Hope that may be of some help.........<br><br>Oh, and the Above and Beyond programme I mentioned - I referenced that because it does more of less exactly what you described in Outlook but automatically, and is a highly visual tool.  <br><br>Good luck!<br><br><br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Joshua:<br><br>My experience of working with AF is that it makes me more able to keep to deadlines, rather than less. As for tracking your project work, well that's a task within AF not part of the system.</div>

<div class="content">Christine,<br><br>Please excuse me for not getting back to you sooner.<br><br>Thank you very much for your detailed and thoughtful answer.  Yes, it does help me move forward in my attempt to harmonize what I think I need (enough overview of everything to keep things going at the right pace) with what I would like to have (the power and flexibility of AF when working on projects).<br><br>Am I right to suppose your experience with working this way has been a positive one?<br><br>Mark,<br><br>Thank you for personally replying to our thoughts and questions on this forum!<br>What do you think about time boxing (i.e. pre-allocating boxes of time for specific tasks) in general?  What do you think of time boxing and AF?  If I have missed you cover that subject in any shape or form, please excuse me. <br><br>Would you say I can expect to keep moving forward on all current projects in a balanced way so that I keep all respective deadlines by solely relying on AF?  Or AF in conjunction with a setup similar to what Christine suggested?<br><br>Again, thank you very much for personally taking the time to get back to us.</div>

<div class="content">Ooops, forgot something for the second time in a row!<br><br>Christine, <br><br>I had already meant to get back to your program suggestion in my first reply, but somehow I forgot to do so both times.  Please excuse me.<br><br>I have heard and read about Above&Beyond, but it did not appeal to me.  A somewhat similar program, TimeTo (<a href="http://www.davidberman.com/software/timeto.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.davidberman.com/software/timeto.php</a> ), caught my attention a while ago, but while offering certain advantages (automatic updating of the schedule, for example), for me it increased overall pressure and added to my stress level in a way that moved me to abandon it.<br><br>Since then I have come to appreciate pre-populating my time landscape myself, although, as I have previously mentioned - and you understood correctly, by the way -, I did not manage to keep everything rolling the way I would have liked to.<br><br>Still, thank you very much for your help!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Joshua<br><br>To deal with your second point first I used A&B a lot in the past and found it incredibly useful - and the visual aspect was something that really appealed. However I would not necessarily use it now - I would be more likely to use the time recording approach mentioned above.<br><br>To answer your other question, yes my experience with working this way has been a positive one. My situation is somewhat fluid at present in that most of my time is allocated to dealing with care issues for elderly parents.  However project management  is an art in itself, and a good system should work with any type of project. I have worked with creating project systems for many years and consequently my overall system needed very little adjustment to slot in with AF. <br><br>The "out of the box" system itself is pretty simple with two modules - the time block approach and the individual task approach as detailed above.  Those modules then just need to be tailored to the individual requirement but the basic structure remains the same. The types of projects that I have worked with in the past would vary from (a) dealing with a major client account on several contracts, requiring structured reporting, a variety of actions, and constant monitoring systems in place to (b) handling a 2-3 week trip to the US, possibly incorporating a conference, and with up to 7 meetings a day, incorporating all follow-up requirements, reporting, and of course all of the travel and scheduling logistics as well as finance.  The "project system" adapts easily and can just as easily handle current projects such as my parents' care or updating my family history.<br><br>AF is effectively a series of lists of tasks - but there is still a need for the overall structures inherent in any business, or just in life in general, which can very easily be defined, whatever they are, as "projects".  Tesco's for example would have specific requirements covering retail, marketing, employment etc.  Those can all be treated as projects. So the "life system" if you like is AF plus your schedule plus your project management system, with AF as the tool to manage everything.<br><br>I would recommend using AF to guide you as to how you use your time rather than trying to create specific blocks.  That may not always be possible or practical but I think you will find that the "standing out" and the "for as long as you feel" rules will begin to create those time blocks naturally as appropriate to the types of projects you are working with.  Give it a try and see how that pans out.<br><br>To look at it another way, projects are the boxes that the various areas of our life or business can be packed into - AF is not just the means to action but is also the tool for thinking "outside the box" :-)</div>

<div class="content">Joshua:<br><br>1) Time boxing. I would recommend that as an option for tasks that require a heavy investment of time each day, e.g. writing a book, practising the piano, learning a language. In each of these cases we are talking about a serious commitment rather than just dabbling as a hobby.<br><br>2) I can only speak from my own experience about AF moving projects towards deadlines. And that experience has been that AF is better at it than my rational mind is. However you can expect AF to expose where you are less than fully committed to a project, or where you have unconscious reservations about the way you are going about it. <br><br>You always have the safety net "common sense" rule that if something needs doing now, do it now.</div>

<div class="content">Christine, Mark,<br><br>Thank you for your insightful responses.  I feel you have both helped me a great deal by providing me with much needed practical insight and shedding light on some previously very unclear matters.  What it's now up to, I suppose, is where the rubber meets the road - hands-on application.  I will incorporate what I have gained and work on developing a holistic way of managing life - and projects. ;-)<br><br>Thank you for your help!</div>

<div class="content">Joshua, firstly thanks for a great post and all for an excellent thread. Mark your comments on *expect AF to expose where you are less than fully committed to a project, or where you have unconscious reservations about the way you are going about it* has absolutely hit the mark for me on an issue I was starting to get concerned about, namely why was I really not moving forward on a couple of areas.<br><br>I thought that I was just experiencing resistance that I could shift by e.g. rephrasing the task, breaking it down etc. But none of this worked. I read your post above and a lightbulb came on!<br><br>I have been back and revisited the issues and considered both those points against them. Lo and behold one has revealed itself as something to which I am less than fully committed and having accepted this rather than trying to pretend otherwise I felt a huge wave of relief, and have decided to withdraw from a programme which whilst prestigious required more commitment than I can currently give.<br><br>The second issue on questioning/reviewing has opened up as being pursued in the wrong way and actually needs professional assistance to complete, i.e. I have accepted that I can't do it alone, so I have to swallow my (foolish) pride and get some help.<br><br>Eureka! I knew that something was niggling on these as I scanned my lists but I never really let "the mind do the talking" and listen to what it was really trying to say. This has really demonstrated to me the true effects of trusting the system and honestly taking the time over my task reviews as I work through the lists.<br><br>Mark, thanks you for sharing so much of your knowledge with us here on the forum, your input is invaluable in guiding us through this process and whilst I know that you gain too from our experiments and experiences with AF your generosity of time, experience and intellect  is truly appreciated. Working with you on AF has changed my life, I am in control, I have increased my personal & professional productivity and i am making better life choices for me and my family, it's as simple as that.</div>

<div class="content">Like Christine, I've found that Autofocus doesn't preclude the need for project management.  <br><br>I have tasks (which go into AF) such as "Review milestones for Project X" to make sure I'm still on target, and to remind me to enter project tasks into my AF list.  I usually write down any deadlines that exist.  E.g., "Finish engineering presentation for Feb. 10".<br><br>And I have tasks such as "Deal with Project Y", which triggers me to go spend some time clearing out all the emails I've been gathering up relating to that project.<br><br>And we still have team planning sessions where we spend a whole day mapping out a project plan for the quarter.  I then take the action items from those sessions and enter them into Autofocus.  And I add a recurring task to review the project plan.<br><br>This all works well till I am overwhelmed by how much work I have -- I start moving too slowly through the pages, and don't come across those project tasks often enough to take appropriate and timely action.  But that's a different story, and I think it has more to do with my reluctance to dismiss pages, than anything else.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-02-7 10:13</div>
<div class="content">Seraphim<br><br>There's been a number of posts about dismissing items and moving "too slowly" through the pages etc.  It is clear that moving quickly through the pages is beneficial; it is also clear that working towards the end of the list has a different "feel to it" than the "standard" page by page working, and Mark has said that he has found that this has occurred naturally.  Most of my early pages now have only two or three items remaining, therefore each time I visit them they only require a short time to be spent.  This in itself is progressing me towards the "working at the end of my lists" scenario.<br><br>Like you I have been concerned that I am not working through my lists quickly enough BUT I am coming to the conclusion that that is a rational concern and not an intuitive one.  Intuitively, I feel that I working through my lists correctly.  Each time I try to tweak the system in any way or to artificially extract items from later pages, it doesn't work and I feel the sense of relief that Mark describes when I go back to working my lists "properly".<br><br>I have posted previously that I think a lot of this has to do with levels of backlogs etc but I think it also has a lot to do with discretionery time..  Mark has mentioned that there has to be discretionery time available but I think a lot of the problem is that our discretionery time may be there but is not constant.  I strongly believe that AF enables us to use most if not all of our discretionery time productively but it cannot create it where it does not exist.  The problem arises therefore not from the time available, or from the numbers of open items on our lists, but from the urgency (real or perceived) of the open items against the discretionary time available at any given point in time.<br><br>In your examples above, you have whole team planning days.  Those days are fantastic and absolutely vital but they do mean that, on those days you have virtually no discretionary time.  My "frantic Fridays" fall into that category - yesterday I did not even look at my lists.  I literally had a patch of discretionery time of 15 minutes - which I used to cancel going out in the evening - and used some of that unexpected free time in the evening "in the forum" which really helped me to think through some of the AF issues.  Like you I add duplicates of important items to the end of the list as they come to mind which I think is fine within AF.  I sometimes writes things down on a new piece of paper which I think helps my subconscious to be working on the solution. I also review all of my lists regularly to ensure that I know what is there.<br><br>What I am finding though is that the speed at which I am working through my lists is actually not causing me "real" concern.  I think the concern is more that I feel I should be concerned if that makes sense.  I am actually NOT worried about dismissing items (or not).  It really is more that I feel I should be dismissing more - and I have no doubt that I will - but at this point in time my instinct is that AF has not given me a strong enough need to dismiss, or to put it another way, I have not had the "aha" moment on those items that identifies why I am resisting.  <br><br>Does that make sense?  I have more open pages that I would like rationally; I have less dismissed items than I would like rationally, I am not moving through the pages as quickly as I think I should be rationally BUT I do feel that I am doing it "right" - that I am working the system correctly and that I just need to do as Mark says and "trust the system".  So far it has not let me down!<br><br>Obviously there is still the rule of common sense but I am also coming to the conclusion that there are two aspects to that rule - one rational and one intuitive.  If I have a deadline approaching when something has to be done and I just "do it" under the common sense rule then that is fine.  However it is a rational decision - which is also fine.  Sometimes (as I have found) intuition tells us to do otherwise and it is at that point we have a choice to make.  How we deal with that is, and always will be a personal choice, and will be dependent upon the factors at the time.  <br><br>However I also think that there is an intuitive common sense rule at play, which, because it is intuitive we don't recognise so easily, and if we do recognise it after the event worry that we have somehow "broken the rules".  I'm not talking about emergency situations where things just get done because they have to there and then.  I'm talking about the tasks on our list that jump out from another page without any degree of conscious thought.  For example, if I am making a cup of coffee and feel like cleaning the sink while I am waiting for the kettle to boil, I do it.  I don't think "I am on page 10 and "clean sink" is on page 20 - if I do it now I am breaking the rules", if it stands out I do it.  When I get to page 20 I will think "ooh, I've already done that" and cross it off.  I probably won't even remember when I did it because it will have been "intuitive" to do it when I did. I am rapidly coming to the conclusion that there are a lot of items like that and that we shouldn't get hung up over doing items that jump out at "odd times".  Let's face it, if we hadn't put the item on our list in the first place we wouldn't get worried about it.  Adding an item to our list doesn't somehow imbue it with magical powers!   Even if AF does feel like magic! :-)</div>
