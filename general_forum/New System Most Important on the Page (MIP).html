<div class="content">Like I said, the Lenten Challenge has made me think of other systems.<br><br>0. Start with a long list, divided into sub-lists, such as a catch-all written on paper. (In other words, a typical AF or FV list.)<br><br>1. Mark the most important task on each page, and give it a score. Ignore the rest (or at least don't agonize over them). Write the score in the top corner so you can find it easily. (On some pages, this will change often.)<br><br>(Important, urgent, standing out most, whatever question works for you.)<br><br>2. Do the most important task in the book. (Hint: It will also be the most important task on its page.)<br><br>3. Cross out the line. Recurring tasks can be crossed-out and rewritten, or edited in place to show when last done (being sure to remove the mark).<br><br>4. Find the new most important task on that page. Mark it, give it a score, and write the score in the top corner (replacing the previous score).<br><br>5. Now look through the entire book for the next most important task. This will be fast, since it will be on the page with the highest number in the corner.<br><br>6. Repeat from 2.</div>
