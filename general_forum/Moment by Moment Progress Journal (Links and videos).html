<div class="content">First of all, thank you to the Forster fans who provided feedback and suggestions - many of them found their way into the system, and the newly recorded videos. Speaking of which:<br><br>I re-recorded the intro video, along with new slides, here: <a href="http://youtu.be/hN1qwOBxeM8" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://youtu.be/hN1qwOBxeM8</a><br><br>Additionally, I have added a second video, describing the daily review process: <a href="http://youtu.be/e1OWs3b1atc" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://youtu.be/e1OWs3b1atc</a><br><br>I'm hoping to tackle the Weekly Reflection/Planning video this week.<br><br>As always, feedback is welcomed.</div>

<div class="content">This is serious business and a very insightful augmentation to Mark's No-List techniques. Mark's No-List-No-Question systems were good, but your choice of question makes this system great.<br><br>The first few times I tried to answer the question, I actually got stumped. (This is usually a good thing for me.)  Once my mind grew accustomed to finding an answer, my outlook on many things changed. For example, I have a Long List lying around, and upon scanning it, I realized that many items on it are important and must be done, but they are rarely the BEST use of my time at any given moment.<br><br>An added benefit for me was that in clarifying what constitutes a good use of time, I identified several behaviors that are NOT good. So this system helps me decide what TO do, and figure out what I need to STOP doing.<br><br>--V</div>

<div class="content">I like the use of tags for projects or just life. It works in the idea of how do I feel now too.  <br>Look forward to the next video.</div>

<div class="content">Glad to read that some people find the above videos/process helpful. I'm no longer using Evernote - instead, I'm using Dyrii (for mac), iPad & Apple Pencil. While the spirit of the above system remains, there are some process changes. The developer of Dyrii and I have discuss creating a video demonstrating how I track my projects (and review my week) using his software.</div>

<div class="content">Thank you, Avrum. This system looks great. I love the idea of asking yourself about the best use of your time just now. I do something a bit different, asking myself what I want to accomplish during the day. I discovered that asking myself questions focus my attention a lot. I will try your idea of taking note about the context and mood.<br><br>I'm using a notebook. Anyone has an idea about adapting this method to pen and paper?</div>

<div class="content">I’ve been using Dyrii this year for my journal notes after deciding not to keep another Bullet Journal. Look forward to seeing how you use Dyrii for what you decribe. I don’t see any check boxes and I am not sure how you find them later. I did try it inThings, using the note section and checkbox list.</div>
