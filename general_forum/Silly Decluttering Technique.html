<div class="content">FVP. <br><br>1. Grab the first bit of clutter you see. <br>2. Throw it out. <br>3. No? Okay put it away. <br>4. No room? Take the first thing in that spot that matters less, and “dot it.”<br>5. Go to step 2 with your latest item. <br>6. If you clear all dots, go back to 1.</div>

<div class="content">I actually thought simple scanning would work for finding something to clean up. I remember once at least feeling overwhelmed, but then I thought "I can at least [do x]", i.e. something simple to start with. That would be like finding something that's ready to be worked on.<br><br>Another method I used (now that I think about it) reminds me of bounce method. I would pick up one thing and throw it out or put it away. Right after I was done with that, I would move on to the NEAREST thing that was ready to be worked on.<br><br>I like your idea though, in that you can use it with FVP to do something(s) that need to be done before something else.</div>
