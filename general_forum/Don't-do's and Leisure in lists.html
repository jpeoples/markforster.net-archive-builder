<div class="content">Do you put don't-do's on your lists?<br><br>If I'm trying to quit soda, should I put "Don't drink coke" in my task list?<br><br>----<br><br>What about off-time activities like "rest", "play a video game", "watch a movie"? Do you put those kind of things in your catch-all / no-list / closed-list lists?</div>

<div class="content">If it's important, then put it in. <br><br>Maybe reframe "don't drink Coke" as a positive: avoid Coke, or day without it. Some say that works better, but I see through it. Currently, I find "drink today's Coke" works. When it's done and crossed off, I see it's been done and keep looking for something else to do.<br><br>Yes, put fun activities on the list! You need them to recharge. Some things are more fun if played when awake and regularly. If I put it off, I don't play, forget my plans, have no progress to report to the social group, struggle to restart, and wander aimlessly instead of getting a nice dopamine boost. I put them on my day and week lists, since I want to remember to play them.</div>

<div class="content">I'd suggest removing sodas from your fridge and then putting "Drink 1 glass water" 3 or 4 times on your list, if you find that helpful. Better to replace a habit with a new habit than trying to stop the old habit.</div>

<div class="content">I would take “don’t drink coke” and reframe it as a plan to drink what’s better.  It’s hard to stop a thing until you have an alternative ingrained in your mind and acceptable in your heart.  What Mike said.</div>
