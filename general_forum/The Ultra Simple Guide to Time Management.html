<div class="content">I have finished the Ultra Simple Guide to Time Management and posted a link on my blog about how to purchase it.  The ebook is $5.00 us.  It is a simple paper based system which I have been using very effectively for the last few months.  It is simple to start and easy to keep up.  I hope all you fans of simplicity will enjoy it. It can be found here.  <br><br><a href="http://simpletimemanagement.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://simpletimemanagement.blogspot.com/</a><br><br>Mark, I sent you a complimentary copy.<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">As I said in another thread, if you want to sell something, it should better be complicated. I doubt as many people are willing to spend $5 for a "ultra simple" something. Call it "The Most Sophisticated Time Management of All Times", and you sales will double! :-)<br><br>BTW, that reminds me of an old joke. A soccer club was offered the ultimate method to win the upcoming championship - for only $1,000,000! As the club had little hope to make it on its own, the leaders decided to take the risk. They paid, and it arrived the promised letter with the ultimate method to win any championship. They opened it and read: "To win any championship, in every single match shoot one goal more than your opponent."<br><br>One could call that an ultra simple method, too... ;-)</div>

<div class="content">AndreasE,<br><br>Well, I hope my method has a bit more value than that LOL.<br><br>I know people love complicated stuff.  I actually think complicated systems are a sophisticated form of procrastination.  Who has time to actually do anything when you have to create multiple lists and complicated plans.<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">I remember someone got quite angry on this list when he didn't like my simple answer and I said I was sure I could think up a more complicated one for him if I tried!</div>

<div class="content">Gerry, before I part with even $5, I would be interested in knowing more about what your system provides.</div>

<div class="content">I agree with Claudia, I have been searching for summary / review, or anything giving indications of what the ebook contains, but found nothing. <br>I am interested in Gerry's reply.</div>

<div class="content">Great question.  I am not super web savvy so I will try to outline it here.  <br><br>In a nutshell, the Ultra Simple Guide to Time Management is a 10 page pdf file which outlines the time management method I have been using successfully over the years.  Some of you may remember my first ebook which was the Simple Guide to Time Management which was a spiral notebook based system.  The new system is intended to further simplify and enhance that system be a complete time management system which addresses what I feel is an issue with many systems namely the integration of project management and task management.  Many of us need more than a task management system, we need a way to integrate some level of project management into what we do.   The system is paper based and designed to be that way on purpose<br><br>The main tool in the system is a simple legal pad, like almost any office has.  The method includes a concept  I call Rigid Flexibility, which is the manner in which the legal pad is used to maximize efficiency and effectiveness.  There are a very few rules to the system, but the ones that are there are very key to it working.  The system is easy to start and keep up and is the one I have used successfully for the last decade.<br><br>I am happy to answer any questions about it here or on my discussion forum, which is linked from my blog.<br><br>Thanks<br><br>Gerry<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Gerry, <br><br>Could you expand on the concept of 'Rigid Flexibility'?</div>
<h2>Reply by Gerry</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-09-3 19:32</div>
<div class="content">Sure, I hope I am not giving away my super secret formula.  In the context of the system, you use the legal pad exclusively which is the Rigidity, but the way in which you use it is very open which is the flexibility. So you have a simple but flexible tool used creatively to keep you on track and very focused.<br><br>Gerry<br></div>

<div class="content">Has anyone bought and read it in the meantime? Is it worth to buy?</div>

<div class="content"><<Has anyone bought and read it in the meantime? Is it worth to buy?>><br><br>I did, and I liked it, particularly the part about project plans. I think it is very easy to use RAF with it. I've posted a question to Gerry at his message board to ask about his own thoughts on the subject. <br><br>However, an in depth discussion will probably give his system away, so perhaps Gerry if you are listening, hopefully you could work out a system to discuss your e-book for those who have purchased it.<br><br>I'm eager to use V4 alongside it too. And will be more than happy to pay for V4 too, if Mark decides to charge for it :) Autofocus has kept me on top of my game at the best of times, and at least kept me above water on those crazy calendar-packed days.</div>

<div class="content">I answered you question on the discussion board.  At this point I do not want to take more of Mark's forum space to discuss my method and will only contribute here if I have something to add regarding Mark's methods.  Thanks again Mark for being so generous and allowing me to make the post announcing my ebook.<br><br>Gerry</div>
