<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-03-1 22:58</div>
<div class="content">Hello everyone,<br><br>I thought it'd start a new thread to announce updates for autofocus.cc in march, since the old thread became kind of bulky with 90+ posts.<br><br>For everyone who doesn't already know, autofocus.cc is a web application that implements Mark's Autofocus Time Management System. <br><br>I can be found at <a href="http://autofocus.cc/" rel="nofollow">http://autofocus.cc/</a> (regular browsers) and <a href="http://mobile.autofocus.cc/" rel="nofollow">http://mobile.autofocus.cc/</a> (mobile browsers).<br><br>Regards,<br>Andreas</div>

<div class="content">Updates for 1 March 2009:<br>=======================================<br><br>Added review modes<br>--------------------------------------------------------<br>There is now a new menu item called "review" with the subitems "all", "active", "done" and "dismissed", which allows you to view your list without actually working on it. You can't mark tasks as done here, but you can re-add dismissed/done items or choose to never re-add them, which removes them from review view. <br><br>Added Option to display “Quick Add Task”<br>--------------------------------------------------------<br>Finally you don't have to go to the separate task add page to add tasks to your list, but you can choose to display a quick add bar above or below your list. This can be configured under "Settings".<br><br>Added Option to display day markers<br>--------------------------------------------------------<br>You can now choose between the old page creation date once on every page or day markers that appear within the list every time a new day started. This is also configurable under settings.<br></div>

<div class="content">Note that sometimes updates change the internal data model, which may make it necessary for you to login again even if you selected the "remember me" option.<br><br>If you have any suggestions, feel free to post them here.<br><br>Here's what's still on my list:<br><br>- The interface gets slowly more cluttered with each new feature, I want to create to different clean interfaces for mobile devices and the big screen. I think that becomes really important if I add all the stuff below.<br>- Add time-specific tasks which are shown above the list when they're due.<br>- Add deadlines with countdown functionality<br>- Add ticklers (add tasks to the list at a certain date or in certain intervals)<br>- Option to show buttons only on mouseover (declutters)<br>- Straighten out some issues with Internet Explorer<br>- "Do" button to mark active task<br>- multi-lingual interface<br>- undo functionality<br><br>Whew.</div>

<div class="content">Hello everyone,<br><br>I still have work through my health issues so there still aren't any updates, but I wanted to remind you that I am still working on this and give you a little glimpse of the future:<br><br><a href="http://autofocus.cc/public/data/test2/two-columns-ext.html" rel="nofollow">http://autofocus.cc/public/data/test2/two-columns-ext.html</a><br><br>Since I have a separate Website for the mobile version, I wanted to use the real estate of bigger screens in the standard version. So there are now multiple columns (classic one column layout will still be available). You can see tabs at the top to switch between multiple lists, and there are separate small lists for deadlines and due tasks. Note that this page is a non-working layout demonstration. <br><br>Please tell me what you think. For all IE-Users: the new layout doesn't really shine in IE6- (usable though). It looks best in Firefox 3.1 and Safari 3+, still great in Firefox 3.0 and good in IE8, IE7, Opera, Konqueror and Chrome.</div>

<div class="content">Andreas,<br><br>That looks very nice.<br><br>There is an article <a href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=a-recipe-for-motivation" rel="nofollow">http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=a-recipe-for-motivation</a> that I think bears on your application. If the journalist who wrote the article describes the science correctly, our motivation to do a task can be increase by the physical clarity and neatness with which the letters in the words describing the task are written. <br><br>There have been other threads about neatness on this forum. I have a real problem with handwriting neatly, which is one reason why I find your application so exciting. Thanks.</div>

<div class="content">Moises:<br><br>Thank you. Interesting article. My main motivation in creating autofocus.cc was the fact that I don't like my handwriting. It's hard to enjoy the benefits of a pen and paper solution with that handycap.<br><br>Everyone:<br><br>A friend of mine warned me that if I add all the time-specific stuff, it'll hurt the "do a single thing and do it well" approach. But I feel better if I have all my tasks in one place. I plan to let users choose between "pure" Autofocus and the additional features. What are your thoughts on this? How do think a perfect digital solution would look like?</div>

<div class="content">Moises:<br><br>No, these won't be hardcoded. You can name you list whatever you want. And you can have more than two, too. I just choose "home" and "work" for the demo since that seems to be the most common setup.</div>

<div class="content">Re: Handwriting.<br><br>I've always had poor handwriting.  I long ago given up long hand and went to lettering.  Even so, I wrote in a crabbed style which was poorly spaced with letters of uneven size.  Then I realized that if I just slowed down and put my focus on each letter I COULD do better.  And it worked.  Now it may seem like a big sacrifice to slow down, it is not.  The payback I get from being able to quickly read what I wrote (rather than having to decipher it) gives me that time back each time I read my writing ... which is more times than I wrote it ;-)<br><br>I suggest just trying it for a day or so and seeing if you have the same results.  Form each letter carefully and keep the vertical size and horizontal spacing even.  Lather, rinse, repeat ;-)</div>

<div class="content">This looks good. I like the option of having time-related info (deadlines or ticklers) available as that would give me one place for everything. I hate to put 'things to do' on the calendar as i like to reserve that for events only. Option to switch off the time-related extras should satisy everyone.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Andreas,<br><br>I've just switched my lists over to autofocus.cc and am mightily impressed -- that is one incredible web application you've written!<br><br>Do you take donations?  I for one would gladly pay for the kind of service you're offering.  You've done a *lot* of work there.<br><br>Also, have you thought about having an iPhone app that syncs with the web version?  Being able to access the lists without having to be online all the time would make it even better -- it'd be a lot faster, and would work when the wireless internet access isn't available.<br><br>I'm just starting to develop applications for the iPhone, and might be interested in tackling such an application myself.  Would you consider adding some sort of API to the web interface to allow for remote syncing from an iPhone app?  Zenbe Lists works like this (and it's rock solid)...combining the web goodness you've written with a similarly-behaving iPhone app and allowing them to sync together would be a killer combination.<br><br>Just some thoughts...<br><br> - Erik.</div>

<div class="content">Andreas,<br><br>The voiceover surprised me as well.  I kept skipping to the next page and listening to two voiceovers overlaid. If you really don't have the time or patience you can find most of the material on the rest of his site, though the course is more productive. Or you can print the visuals (I'd print them to OneNote), which are generally pretty self explanatory. <br><br>You'll want to print the worksheets in any case.<br><br>BTW, comparing the web material and the visuals gives a great example of how the visuals should not just be bulletted notes. We all know that, but it's nice to see it done well.</div>

<div class="content">Andreas,<br><br>As I posted previously, if you simply SLOW DOWN and form your letters carefully your handwriting will improve in a major way.  And use lettering rather than the old Palmer style they taught in school.  It is slower but you more than make up the  time when you read it later.  No doubt his course is better than my advice, but if you don't have the patience for a course ... just slow down and you'll get a big pay off.</div>

<div class="content">Clouds:<br><br>Currently, my autofocus.cc related items keep getting dismissed. I have fully recovered from my spinal injury (at least I think so), but now the deadline for my thesis looms over my head larger than ever. It's June 30, 2009, so you probably won't see the all-new autofocus.cc before then, I'm afraid. I may slip in a small multi-list hack for the current version, but I can't promise anything. In the mean time, you could create a second account for having two lists. When the new version is finished, we can merge them into one account.<br><br>Regards,<br>Andreas</div>

<h2>Reply by Andreas</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-06-9 11:36</div>
<div class="content">Derek:<br><br>You can't dismiss single tasks. Af.cc tracks whether you already did something on the current page on the current pass. If you click "next page" when you are not allowed to do so by the rules, the app will tell you that and offer you to dismiss all remaining tasks on that page - if you use short captions, it will be a red button labeled "D!".<br><br>An exception to this is the last page, which you can always leave without dismissing.</div>

<div class="content">Derek:<br><br>Yes, I will. Just have to finish my thesis (deadline is today!) and give a presentation about it on Thursday, then I'll give AF.cc a major overhaul. You'll be able to switch between AF1 and AF2 rules on the fly. <br><br>Problem is, I will need to change the database structure, which means there is a risk of damaging existing data in the conversion. I will be as careful as possible. I will make a copy of the database and keep the old version available in case something goes wrong. <br><br>I will also inform everyone a few days ahead via email. I never did that before but I think it's necessary in this case. The new version will also sport an option to disallow me sending you emails. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">In addition to "delete account" it would be nice to have a function "purge completed items." I've played around with it, like it, may start using it soon, but then I'll have these (completed) bogus tasks cluttering up the first page. Yes, I won't notice them anymore once I have a decent list going, but I'm a bit of a neat-freak :-).<br><br>BTW, thanks for making this public, it seems like a very nice and very streamlined application!</div>
