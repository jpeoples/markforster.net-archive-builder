<div class="content">... a partner to keep me accountable vis-a-vis a blog (in development). In return, I'd be glad to return the favor for a project you're working on. My plan is to use Wishcraft's project planning to break down my project into quantifiable goals, and then throw the tasks into AF. <br><br>Any takers?</div>

<div class="content">I'd be very up for this!<br><br>I'm doing a distance learning course at the moment that has far less frequent 'deliverables' than I'm used to when studying so I could really do with someone to hold me accountable on that.<br><br>I would also value the experience of helping someone else keep on track.  This is likely to be an important skill in my future life!<br><br>What do you think?<br><br>Lucy</div>

<div class="content">Avrum,<br><br>I might be up for this as well.  I've not done the accountability thing before ... I mostly work on my projects alone, accountable to myself.  I'd like to see if the experience is different.  Let me know when you get it set up.  I'll go dig out my copy of Wishcraft and scan it again to set my level again.  No matter the outcome, the suggestion has gotten me thinking.  Thanks.</div>
