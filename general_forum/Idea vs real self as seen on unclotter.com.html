<div class="content">UNCLOTTER.com  hmm.<br><br>I find the example frustrating.  I don't think "driving a jeep up a mountain with family" is anyone's "ideal self".  It may be someone's (her) ideal way to have fun for a weekend, and maybe typing at a computer with baby on shoulder isn't the ideal work for her.<br><br>Talk about making awesome vacations awesomer.  Talk about making jobs better.  <br>Don't say "vacation is my ideal" and "work is less ideal".  If you want to talk about "the ideal", you need to include everything.  Maybe structuring your life so it includes both great jobs and great free time.  Maybe transform your job so it feels like a never ending awesome vacation.</div>
