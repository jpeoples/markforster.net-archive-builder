<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2011-05-18 6:36</div>
<div class="content">I was looking for a nice web-based outliner that can import/export OPML. I found this <a href="http://checkvist.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://checkvist.com</a> . Its free user account provides ample features, only needs upgrade to Pro for added https security.<br><br>I've searched this forum and didn't find any mention of usage for Autofocus / Superfocus other than a short 24apr2009 comment in <a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2008/11/17/the-simplest-time-management-method.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2008/11/17/the-simplest-time-management-method.html</a> and this 30apr2009 blog post <br><a href="http://checkvist.tumblr.com/post/561118438/autofocus-with-checkvist" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://checkvist.tumblr.com/post/561118438/autofocus-with-checkvist</a> .<br><br>Anyone else have "played" with it for Superfocus or general outlining? It looks to me a very useful/functional outliner. I hope to use it for outlining articles/blogs, but I fear before long I'll be "playing" with using it instead of my stable Toodledoo Superfocus setup. ;-}<br><br>I've published a list here <a href="http://checkvist.com/checklists/70527-introduction-to-checkvist" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://checkvist.com/checklists/70527-introduction-to-checkvist</a> .</div>

<div class="content"><< I fear before long I'll be "playing" with using it instead of my stable Toodledo Superfocus setup. >><br><br>I couldn't resist it. Now 145 active tasks  from page 11 to page 27 were "imported" from my Toodledo Superfocus list to my Checkvist list. After 1 day usage, I like Checkvist workflow feel over that of Toodledo. Lets see whether I still feels the same after 2 weeks. ;-)<br><br>Screenshot ...<br><a href="http://www.smsabri.com/random/ramblings/images/Checkvist-Superfocus-20110519.PNG" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.smsabri.com/random/ramblings/images/Checkvist-Superfocus-20110519.PNG</a></div>

<div class="content">There's a running tally of C2 on each page. I don't see any actual C2. In my analagous situation I add a blank task at the end of each page and the C2 items are added after that.</div>

Thanks for posting the links and your set up. I agree: the flow is smooth and its incredibly easy to use. I've given myself some licence to play with this for a while.</div>

I don't see any actual C2.>><br><br>I use priority 1 (color red) to indicate C2 tasks, that I drag to top of each page. In that Checkvist-Superfocus-20110519.PNG screenshot, if you squint you might see that "(d) Mark Forster SFv3 forum (May)" is in red text, since it was C2 for me then. The blue background (current task) hides that red text a bit. I'm keeping my active C2 numbers to not more than 2 or 3, and running tally of C2 for each page not much more than 10.<br><br>Greenchutney said:<br><< The screenshot is helpful but can you explain your setup in bit more detail? >><br><br>Basically, "Pages (Col2)" are all the SF pages. I marked in red background (priority 4) the current page, and marked in green background (priority 6) the last/open page. A "space bar" complete/reopen a task. You can use mouse with shift key to drag drop "re-enter" task, but I prefer to use the keyboard ctrl-up/down to move "re-enter" the tasks. Can use ctrl-end to quickly move current task to end of the list.<br><br>Anyway, seeing/touching my lists may be better than my woeful explanation. So, I've "published" for now my Checkvist list at <a href="http://checkvist.com/checklists/70535-using-checkvist-for-mark-forster-s-superfocus" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://checkvist.com/checklists/70535-using-checkvist-for-mark-forster-s-superfocus</a> . Will unpublish it later.<br><br>I've yet to play with it from my Android mobile, hope it'll work well without a keyboard. :-/</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the detailed notes and the list! So, I assume the number in brackets (col2), is manually input? Ctrl-end seems to put the task all the way to the bottom, not the bottom of the "page"!</div>

<div class="meta">2011-05-20 5:17</div>
<div class="content">GC, <br><br>Yes, Ctrl-end move task all the way to bottom, then a quick tab-tab, will get it into the right place. Ctrl-end, ctrl-right, ctrl-right also works, and quicker for me when pressing ctrl with my left pinky.<br><br>Yes, running tally of col2 in brackets is manually updated. I'm not too sure its worth the effort to maintain that running tally, and whether keeping numbers of active col2 items small is sufficient for efficient SF. Keeping the tally for at least next two weeks. <br><br>There is a minimal Checkvist mobile page <a href="http://checkvist.com/m" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://checkvist.com/m</a> for display, adding and editing tasks, but no options to move task around. However, according to <a href="http://checkvist.uservoice.com/forums/2121-general/suggestions/42535-iphone-android-version" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://checkvist.uservoice.com/forums/2121-general/suggestions/42535-iphone-android-version</a> a HTML5-based iphone/android client is planned.</div>

<div class="content">Ah, the curse of a new approach as one settles into a slightly older one!!!<br><br>Looks interesting, and tempting.<br><br>I am going to stay with Toodledo on the desktop (Windows) and Ultimate To-Do List (Android app which sync nicely with each other, however, I will keep an eye of comments for this Checkvist, maybe use it for brainstorming etc.<br><br>I'm finding Ultimate very good, probably the best electronic solution so far for moi, but I have to watch out I don't try to customise it with all its capabilities otherwise some of the flow of SF may go away.  I've spent too much on the 'system' itself per se before!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Roger, I felt the same way but gave myself a chance to fool around with it. Couple of C2 tasks later, I had ported over quite easily from my Todopaper setup. But then, I dont have too many individual tasks; I tend to have a few hairy projects I battle with most of the day. CV is ideal for those kinds of things-collecting research notes from the web and the like, and hyperlinking is very easy. Hope you have fun with it.</div>

<div class="content"><< Looks interesting, and tempting >><br><br>Roger, it is very interesting especially if you are inclined to Checkvist strengths ...<br>* hierarchical lists - really great for outlining /breaking down tasks into sub-tasks and sub-sub-tasks in projects portion of the list. <br>* unmatched keyboard support - everything can be done using the keyboard<br>* search and filtering - instant filtered tasks as you key in the search keyword<br>... the above are the first three reasons given in Checkvist login screen, and first two are not in Toodledo.<br><br>Main cons, no native client for mobile, and mobile web version is very limited for now.<br><br>I also find Checkvist giving more paper like feel when doing Superfocus ...<br><br>(1) Scanning tasks  - Mark said, "As for my actual scanning technique, I do it with a pen in hand and pause momentarily at each task." The cursor, highlighting current task with blue background, moved using arrow down key, replicates this feel quite nicely. <br><br>(2) Reentering tasks - Manually you would cross out the task in current page, flip to page and rewrite the reentered task whilst getting a feel of what other task are on the last page, then you flip back to current page. In Checkvist you Ctrl-end on task to be rentered it get moved after last page, you press tab-tab (or ctrl-right, ctrl-right) and task move to last slot of last page. Whilst doing that and Paging up to get back to current page you get a feel of tasks on the last page.<br><br>(3) Done tasks - Strike-out all the way through with a pen. In Checkvist a space-bar click strike-out the task and grey it.<br><br>Just giving you more "excuse" to give yourself "a change to fool around with [Checkvist]", as JD did. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Okay, I am a convert :) Moved my toodledo lists to checkvist. It definitely feels like a paper based workflow. Also, the ability to have the lists numbered helps me to limit the number of items per page - a pain point for me with toodledo. I put a line between the C2 items, Home, Work items - visually much easier than toodledo where I had to mess around with priorities etc. <br><br>I am hoping for a native iPhone app in the near future. But, till then I will get by with mobile view. <br><br>sabre23t, <br>Thanks for all your help. I do have a question. How do you deal with dismissed items? The options I am thinking of is to either tag them as dismissed or move it to a different list. <br><br>GC</div>

<div class="content">Hi GC - perhaps you could use the task-highlight option (key 4,5 or 6). There does not seem to be a yellow highlight option, however. Only green, blue or red.</div>

<div class="content">GC: Tag the page!  Only unstarted tasks should remain on it, so all its items are dismissed.</div>

<div class="content">GC, good to see another one using Checkvist for Superfocus. I see Kirill had mentioned "there is a company which started developing Mac/iOS application for the Checkvist" on <a href="http://checkvist.uservoice.com/forums/2121-general/suggestions/42535-iphone-android-version." target="new" rel="nofollow">http://checkvist.uservoice.com/forums/2121-general/suggestions/42535-iphone-android-version.</a><br><br>Regarding dismissed items, I'll  mark them complete and move them to a "dismiss" page, currently on the same list (may be later on different list).<br><br>Mmm ... for some reason I can't see "View as numbered list" in my Chrome or IE browser for my Checkvist list. Let me try creating a totally new list. Nope can't see it still. Is it only working on Safari? Let me try on my iPad. It does work in Safari on iPad. I just posted the problem to Kirill on <a href="http://checkvist.uservoice.com/forums/2121-general/suggestions/1858371-show-as-a-numbered-list" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://checkvist.uservoice.com/forums/2121-general/suggestions/1858371-show-as-a-numbered-list</a> .</div>

After doing a C1 task, I'll then colour the next page blue "5". I have the last open page as green "6" colour.<br><br>Particularly when I'm using the filter/search "/" function, I'll colour the next task blue "5". Otherwise the blue cursor is sufficient to identify my current task.

<div class="content">Hi Sabre - I hope Checkvist is working well for you. I had to abandon it I'm afraid and I am back to OneNote. CV has a fluid feel about it no doubt, but Onenote's ability to store project documents was an important consideration in my projects-based work. The other MS Office based functions are an added bonus.</div>

<div class="content">Hi JD, I'm still on CV. I store simple project information directly in CV list; either in separate CV list or directly in the Superfocus list. For project docs (word, spreadsheets, slides) I store them in Google Sites, so I can easily link to those docs from my CV list. Okay, as easy as typing those "a href=" thingies. Did you try that?<br><br>Oh, Kirill had helped me solve my "show as numbered list" prob, <a href="http://checkvist.uservoice.com/forums/2121-general/suggestions/1858371-show-as-a-numbered-list" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://checkvist.uservoice.com/forums/2121-general/suggestions/1858371-show-as-a-numbered-list</a> , turns out it was my sysadmin fault. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">I, on the other hand, am a complete convert! I have moved to checkvist from toodledo and I haven't looked back since then. It flows very well and is so flexible. I have tweaked a few things for my way of doing things and is working very well. The mobile version is tolerable (I primarily use it in read-only mode) but I hope the "real" mobile version comes soon. Then I would be a happy camper!<br><br>GC</div>

<div class="content">Hi GC, good to hear you're still enjoying CV. <br><br>After posting my previous post in this thread, I did a review of Pros and Cons of CV ...<br>PROS:<br>* Very fluid keyboard based usage of the outliner for SF on desktop/notebook<br>* Much more like paper, than toodledo on desktop/notebook<br>* The collapsible outlining mode really fits my way of thinking/planning.<br>CONS:<br>* Limited web mobile version, no support for soft keyboards, basically makes it read-only for SF.<br>* No native client for Android (or other) mobiles.<br>* Results in minimal SF use, when not with desktop/notebook.<br><br>That last item prompted me to give a quick look for a good collapsible outliner apps on Android. I found one iRT GTasks Outliner for Android, that syncs with Google Tasks for desktop/notebook. After a quick try yesterday, today is my first full day using the combination of iRT GTasks Outliner for Android mobiles with Google Tasks on the desktop/notebook. I'll report my progress in a separate thread, and see whether after a week or two I can live with its limitation on desktop/notebook, or come back to CV. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi all - I've turned things inside out again, but I am quite happy with what emerged after tossing the tech-salad bowl.<br><br>I owe it all to Mark of course! After his post on the 'Dreams' set up in Evernote, I decided to give it another look, having earlier chosen OneNote over it because I liked the flexible way it kept information, and the ease of implementing a tech solution for SF.<br><br>I was bowled over by Evernote - its key strength is the multiple ways you can view and relate to your information through a slick tags system. Sure, ON has tags, but it is cumbersome to set and view information in their tagged form. For example, Marks Dreams post which I clipped to EN can be viewed as 'Web clips", or as 'Dreams', two tags I set up. <br><br>The upshot of all of this is that I back to pen and paper on my SF list! That's because EN sucks as a list manager and I don't really want to be working off two programs daily. <br><br>I'm feeling increasingly productive (everything gets deposited into EN efficiently referenced), and good ol' pen and paper keeps me moving quickly through the SF list. I suppose that's what I wanted for my work - a good repository for my projects and papers and less of a tech solution for SF itself. I wonder if my own Dreams statement had anything to do with this!</div>

<div class="content">Hi JD,<br><< everything gets deposited into EN efficiently referenced ... good ol' pen and paper keeps me moving quickly through the SF list >><br><br>I did consider doing SF on my small carry everywhere A7 notebook. However, I've been using that small notebook as my quick capture everything device. Doing both in the same small A7 notebook is a bit crammed. So i'm still doing SF on an outlining tool (iRT GTasks Outliner) on my Android mobile as mentioned above. I did peek at a nice mind mapping software on Android recently though, Thinking Space. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Wow ... it has been that long ago that I used CheckVist (CV). At the moment, I have fallen off SF and FV bandwagon. Only jotting down must do on a short list and doing them. Just started using CV again.<br><br>Anyway, quite recently there is a touch screen friendly mobile web version of CV at <a href="http://m.checkvist.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://m.checkvist.com</a> . You can now easily move/promote/demote tasks with by touching/dragging. You should be able to easily use mobile web CV for FV/SF now. Anyone doing that? GC? JD?<br><br>PS: <br>The older mobile web version is still available at <a href="http://checkvist.com/m" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://checkvist.com/m</a> .<br>The desktop web version is even more useful than before at <a href="http://checkvist.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://checkvist.com</a> (now it does support file attachments, but for paid pro version).</div>
