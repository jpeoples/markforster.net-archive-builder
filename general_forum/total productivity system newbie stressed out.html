<div class="content">So I just started working on the Autofocus system today following the lifehacker link. I have always had a problem with procrastination and it's always been in the back of my mind to find a system to help me with this. AF seemed simple enough so I thought I would start with that. <br><br>I have gotten SO MUCH done today!<br><br>I am really impressed with the results, but I'm starting to feel a little chained by my list. It seems to ask me to stay doing something at all times and it sort of makes me a little anxious (maybe this is what getting over procrastination feels like?). So, a practical question about the system:<br><br>The AF instructions tell you to deal with a page at a time. You move onto the next page when you can cross everything out (meaning you've worked on it some or finished it) or if nothing on the page sticks out to you and then you dismiss the undone ones. Does that mean, in order to move to the next page, everything on the current page must be worked upon just a little? If not, dismiss it? <br><br>This seems limiting somehow, like if I know for sure there's something on the next page I want to do right now, and maybe something on the current page afterwards. Should it be a daily time limit? Anything you haven't worked on today gets dismissed? What about things that can only be worked on later?<br><br>Please help me clear up my understanding. Thank you.<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Jason,<br><br>A common confusion there.<br><br>1) Work on one page so long as items pop out at you.<br>2) When an item is partially done, write it at the end of the last page and cross it off where you found it.<br>3) When you complete an item, just cross it off.<br>4) Move to the next page and repeat.<br>5) When you have worked on the last page, go back to the first page where there are still items to do.<br>6) You DISMISS all items on a page when you go to that page and don't find AT LEAST ONE of them you are moved to do.<br>7) When those items are dismissed, the page is "closed" or "finished" and you no longer return to it.<br><br>So where you are going wrong is in thinking that you can't move off the page until you close it.  Not true.  You move from the page if you work on at least ONE item or don't work on ANY items (in which case the page is closed off).<br><br>Make sense now?<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Jason<br><br>Actually the system maybe should come with a a health warning - it is addictive!  There is such an exhiliaration to the new experience of "achieving" when you start using the system that it is quite a high!  That does settle down but doesn't go entirely! :-)<br><br>I put everything on the lists, work type items, home type items, leisure items, hobbies etc, and find that the system starts to really balance those things well.  It does take a while to "trust the system" when you have urgent items that you are aware of in there, and to be honest, although I absolutely took to the system from day 1 and experienced the benefits almost instantaneously, it still took me at least a month before I felt I was really learning to trust the system and I still feel I have a lot to learn.  <br><br>The best advice I can give is to to check out the FAQ's - everyone has questions about when to move on from a page, what items to include, "AF addiction" etc., so they may help to answer some of your initial questions.<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/645945" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/645945</a><br><br>Good luck!<br><br></div>
