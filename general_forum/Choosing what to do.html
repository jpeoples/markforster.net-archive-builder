<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-04-24 7:56</div>
<div class="content">In the late 1990's the BBC made a TV drama called THE MISSING POSTMAN (starring James Bolam).  It's about a postman who decides to deliver the mail personally to various addresses in the UK (instead of the through the normal system).  He gets to Scotland and stays for some time with a lady who had a simple way of choosing what to do. She would write a task, job etc on a slip of paper and place it in a big jar.  When she wanted to choose what to do she would dip into the jar and pull out a task.  Seems like a good way to make a choice when choosing is hard to do.<br><br>Anyway, I thought I'd make a (hopefully light hearted) contribution to the discussion.  BTW - I think most of the programme is available on YouTube<br><br>All the best ... WP</div>

<div class="content">You know, I think I vaguely remember that. It's a similar method to "The Diceman" by Luke Rheinhart <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dice_Man" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dice_Man</a> (warning: some strong language in this link). <br><br>I've always thought a degree of randomness was quite a good thing in life. It stops us getting into too much of a rut, and also stops us agonising over some decisions. It can lead to new experiences.<br><br>See my article:<br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2007/3/5/the-random-element-how-to-get-out-of-the-rut.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2007/3/5/the-random-element-how-to-get-out-of-the-rut.html</a></div>

<div class="content">From Mark's blog post above:<br><br>"One of the things which often holds us back from making decisions is the belief that we must make the “right” decision. Sometimes people will put off making necessary decisions for years, possibly even for a lifetime, because they are afraid that they might be making the “wrong” decision. But the truth is that there is are no right and no wrong decisions, only decisions with different consequences."<br><br>This is the kinda stuff I like to preach, but been having a hard time practicing lately. Have a "big" decision looming overhead.<br><br>No matter how I decide or whether I do or not, things are gonna change in my life significantly.<br><br>I used to rarely decide anything. People think that in itself is a decision. It's not. "Decide" means to cut off. To remove all options and commit yourself to what is left.<br><br>Choosing coursework. I think for months after not deciding whether or not to take a course on topology, I was still weight the pros and cons. I was weighing the pros and cons at times after the course was over. I hadn't decided yet. I never made that decision.<br><br>I don't engage in that kinda nonsense anymore, except in "big" decisions. The decision I face matters a lot to me and to others around me and to many who I do not know.<br><br>It would take some kinda chutzpah to roll dice or flip a coin on this one.</div>

<div class="content">As bad as "Truly Tasteless Jokes" by Blanche Knott?  <br><br>I picked it up in Johannesburg in the 1980s and it helped us get through some incredibly boring afternoon sessions in week-long MBA schools (unrelated snippet: my group emerged top of the class at the end of the four year part-time program for academic achievement).<br><br>I can still see one of my colleagues crying with laughter in both eyes, unusual because John only has one eye, like my UK optometrist (yes, really).  I think it was the one about the bloke who had a baby elephant's trunk transplanted to replace his chopped-off male member.  Crude, it was, but also funny.<br><br>So, c'mon Norman, which other forums do you inhabit that would permit your litany? However, I think the passing years since the 1980s might have made me less tolerant of some brands of alleged humour.  I used to think anything goes, that humour is one lifebelt that keeps us afloat in life's stormy seas, but these days, maybe not.</div>

He was able to pack arenas with his act.<br><br>Probably the best thing that came outta the Diceman phenomenon was Gilbert Gottfried's absurd reduction of Dice's material. Gottfried still does the bit. It's hilarious, especially since most folks have no idea what he is doing.</div>

<div class="content">Mark: Another good blog post. Thanks for sharing it. As I'm leaving for vacation in a week, I can see my kids getting a big kick out of choosing a place to eat that way. I just hope we wouldn't end up at a biker bar! Though the biker crowd having aged considerably would probably be pretty safe. ;-)<br><br>Jacqueline: I started doing that a bit with the kids and chores. I have six kids so I write down six chores and whatever number they roll (that hasn't already been taken) is their chore. The cool thing is they don't complain as the die has assigned it.</div>

Now try it on your vacation... :-)  I like the aspect of asking random strangers where to go or what to do so that you don't even have your own filters on for a list of possible things to do.<br><br>You could apply this to an AF-style list.   Say you have six goals or projects, write them down on a list and roll the dice for what you will work on at any point in time (assuming no deadlines).  Then just keep rolling because it doesn't matter what you choose as long as you keep moving - if it's a direction you want to go that is and aren't willing to let it go totally to chance.  I might experiment with that this week.  :-)</div>

<div class="content">I tried this actually on my AF1 list for about a week last winter. I numbered all of the open tasks and then used Excel to randomly choose a number. Even if it chose an extremely unpleasant task, I applied "little and often" -- ie had to take at least one small step toward moving the task forward. <br><br>     It worked surprisingly well for the first three or four days -- a lot of things I'd been dreading or postponing were accomplished, and also there was no feeling of "overwhelm" from a long AF list because I knew eventually everything would get done (on some random day in the future). <br><br>     In the end though I dropped it because of (a) the old problem that completing one task inevitably leads to two more (and so the list just got bigger and bigger), and (b) looking back at that week, it seems mostly filled with "busy work".<br> <br>     Basically you're bypassing your rational and intuitive side, which can be a good idea for a few days if you're locked in negative mental patterns (eg pessimism or fatigue). But eventually a gulf opens up between what your rational and/or intuitive side want to do, and what the random system is choosing for you, and that actually creates a new source of stress. <br><br>     Eventually what you need to do becomes really obvious, and you don't need the training wheels of the random list any longer.</div>

<div class="content">Of course the truth is that most people's life tends to be pretty random anyway. <br><br>I mean if one wrote a list of things which one was intending to do today, someone could open a book on which ones you would actually get round to: <br><br>Have breakfast 1/100, <br>Clear email Evens, <br>Write report which you have been putting off for weeks 10/1.<br><br>And how much of what your life is like today could you have predicted 20 years ago?</div>

<div class="content">Found these techniques helpful in more "trivial" group decisions. A dozen or so of us at work usually take a longer lunch off campus on Fridays. Trying to decide were to go would pretty much start as soon as the work day did. And more than a few times the group would split and end up going to two places instead of one.<br><br>Then I asked everyone to write down their top five favorite places to go on Friday. I made a list of the results, noting how many times a choice was selected.<br><br>Ended up with about 20 suggestions within those 100 or so votes. Wrote a script to "randomly" select one of those suggestions with relative weight given to the popularity of each selection.<br><br>RIght before lunch, we all get together and hit the "roll" button and see where we are going and go.</div>

<div class="content">Simon, thanks for that report on how randomly generated AF works. I was pretty sure that's how it would fall out eventually. But I do like the idea for an occasional change of pace. Interesting you mention "training wheels." This week I've discovered I really act helpless sometimes as though I don't know what I should be doing. The truth is I know EXACTLY what I should be doing; I just don't want to do it. I've been more intentional about just doing what needs doing. The same holds true for problem solving. There are times I pretend I don't know the solution to one of my difficulties when the truth is if I friend had the same difficulty, I'd have no problem sharing the solution. <br><br>Mark: That's pretty funny putting odds on getting things done. My family would be able to predict very well, especially my husband. In the past he has LOL at my ambitious daily to-do list, as well he should have. ;-) As for being able to predict my life now from 20 years before, I'm sure it's my age (42), but I would have been way off. The only thing I wouldn't be surprised about is the writing and speaking. <br><br>Norman: That's a neat idea. I have an iPhone app that will essentially do the same thing. You can set an area and a cuisine or leave those open and "roll." Wish I could say I've used it! Maybe on the next rare occasion I go out, I'll give it a spin.</div>

<div class="content">Mark:  I don't agree that I could have predicted where I'd be right now with any degree of accuracy.  I certainly could not have predicted the path I have taken.<br><br>As to the random way of picking tasks, I get that one might get stuck and need an emergency fix of this kind.  (In fact, it seems kind of a neatly simple answer to that kind of problem.)  But, OTOH, what would be the point of running one's whole life this way?  It seems to me that abdicates the responsibility of living.  Even if I were to decide to randomly choose from a task list ... I'd rationally choose the items to put on the list before I randomly selected them.</div>

<div class="content">Mark - I should have guessed that you would have already considered and tried a "Random Choice Selector" .  As a very "button down" type of person the freedom from the stress of choosing - by taking a completely random approach from time to time sounds very exciting - and I'm going to give it a go.  <br><br>Simon - rather than rewriting all my things to do on small slips of paper and putting them in a bit jar I was thinking of using some sort of random number generator so I found your experience very interesting.  It's helped me to clarify my thinking and to come to the conclusion that random choice would be good for blowing a breath of fresh air through my task management approach from time to time but my day to day approach is just grinding through my lists (AF1 style).<br><br>BTW Norman U your recent post that included a line about the incompetent people you work with tickled my fancy - I thought I was the only one who inflicted that on my ever patient wife - so reading your post lifted my spirits.<br><br>And if anyone's interested I'm reading "The Heart of Christianity" by Marcus Borg at the moment and finding it very thought provoking and I don't have to worry about what to do tomorrow because it's the ANZAC DAY public holiday here in Sydney tomorrow so I can put TM on hold and start again on Tuesday.  <br><br>All the best ...

<div class="content">Mel,<br><br>C.S Lewis is one of my favourite authors - he influenced my views when I first started reading his books some years ago.  I also liked his Screwtape books.  Although some of his language is a bit dated now I still like to dip in from time to time.  apart from the Bible, Thomas a Kempis was also important to me for a while - but less so now.  I'm finding Mr Borg's book quite challenging.  Iniitially I baulked at his writing but the more I read the more I think he makes a lot of sense.  Anyway, I'll keep reading and let you know how I go (so long as Mark and the other "senior" members of the discussion forum have no objections).<br><br>All the best ... WP</div>

<div class="content">I don't think the emphasis should be on how you can predict what you're going to be *doing* anyway, it should be on how you are *being*.

Mike would be playing devil's advocate somewhere, Norman would be searching for enlightenment and still be acerbic, David will be overwhelmed with too much to do... it's all how you choose to play the game.  And your way of being determines how you play and whether you win the game, not what you take on as a goal or direction.<br><br>I think what the point of Rhinehart's work - or one of them is - that you can choose how to play, as everyone has many choices of ways of being, they just don't tend to see it.

<div class="content">Hey J,<br><br>Yes, that 'bout nails it.  Personality is more persistent and overarching than the  particular existential bits.<br><br>I kind of like the way Richard Brodie puts it: (Particularly the last sentences!)<br><br>"Life is largely composed of conversations. Conversations are composed of memes. In Level 1 we are unaware of this. In Level 2 we see the world as a solid, understandable body to be interacted with. In Level 3 we see the world as a canvas to be painted, an instrument to be played, or a block of marble to be sculpted by us for our purpose. We choose to do this for good or for evil. If we choose good, good is returned to us in unexpected ways. If we choose evil, evil is returned. Either way, it looks like the way we choose is the way of the world."<br><br>And, of course, "good" and "evil" oversimplifies, IMO.  Substitute any world view for "good/evil" and that sentiment holds true, essentially.  And given that it is basically a reworking of Transcendentalism, I'm sure that Norman (and perhaps Mark) would agree.  We shall see ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br>"Or possibly even of "As you sow, so shall you reap", which is a lot older than Transcendentalism."<br><br>This old saw, I find to be exceptionally dangerous. In some sense it is true and has been written down in the Western tradition since Hesiod's _Works and Days_. The little truth it does contain is rather obvious and not very illuminating. But the moral implications can end up rather monstrous in my opinion. <br><br>From the plague which devastated Athens without apparent relation to the virtue of the people it destroyed to the Lisbon earthquake to the recent Haitian disaster,to why some people get cancer and do not recover and others do, etc, this idea can be rather ugly in my opinion especially when torn from the context of the entire complicated text in which lies.<br><br>The metaphor is faulty anyhow. Sometimes what you sow does not come to harvest due to conditions outside your control or you fortuitously find a crop spring forth you did not plant.<br><br>Personally,I find this fragment much more in line with the way of the world:<br><br>"That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust."</div>

<div class="content">Of course it implies that. As well as other things. What a snippet of text implies is based on its context. And that snippet of text has been contextualized in many ways.<br><br>Maybe across the pound where nutty stuff like Calvinism, Transcendentalism, New Thought, Unitarianism, New Age, 12 Step Movements and what not did not catch on as much, you have more robust understanding of such words. In America, just watch when anyone is suffering, more and more our discourse locates the entire fault within the person. The suffering, even nowadays cancer, is result of ill deeds and now the thoughts! of the one who suffers.<br><br>Our language of the pain and suffering of others revolves more around blame and justice than love, compassion, and healing.<br><br>Americans loves lines like one quoted above and the more Biblically astute find much comfort in story of Jacob and Essau as proof of the divine meritorious nature of the success they find in life and the pain and suffering others find.<br><br>When we Americans are at best, we blame entire populations of countries for natural disasters which befall them.</div>

<div class="content">Norman: I, too, am fiddling with my WWND bracelet. I'm not sure what you mean about Jacob and Esau. This is clearly not a story of success vs. failure. Jacob's account of his life wouldn't be a happy rags-to-riches tale. In fact, he would be an Oprah favorite, wouldn't he? He had two wives who were terribly jealous of one another, a father who didn't favor him, a father-in-law who cheated him, a wife who died in childbirth after he foolishly proclaimed that whoever had his FIL's gods would die, a daughter who was raped, a son who was sold off into slavery (who he thought had died), another son who slept with his concubine. I could go on...<br><br>Neither was Esau the poor soul you might expect him to be given his rebellion in marrying godless women and his carelessness with his birthright. In fact, he became a very wealthy man. Reaping what you sow is a general principle and just as we don't really know why some seed germinates and some doesn't, we shouldn't comment on why tragedy befalls another. God alone knows.</div>

<div class="content">Norman,<br><br>It would be just rude of me to comment on the foibles of some of your countrymen. Here in the UK we have plenty of people ready to blame others for their own (the others' own) misfortune. Although you don't hear much about Haitian religion, for instance, people have commented that it was the richest country in the Caribbean until their revolution. The point being, presumably, that freedom from enlightened European rule is bad for you.<br><br>The real problem with freedom, of course, is that you only have yourself to blame. Which can be trying.<br><br>My knowledge of C17th English grammar is not perfect, but I'm pretty sure that this phrase establishes a 1-1 mapping between reaping and sowing. As a Deep Truth, this is a bit on the obvious side. But as a practical reminder to keep investing in the long term it is helpful. Consider the traditional "important vs urgent" grid for evaluating your commitments. Replace it with "important (current goals) vs investing (growth)".  <br><br>This is one of Nicholas Bates' key themes.</div>

<div class="content">Norman,<br><br>>>>  Its called dumbing down your material for your readers.  <<<<br><br>Ehhh, not so much, I think.  The way I see it ... the purpose of writing is to communicate.  Successful communication is achieved when the person at the other end has in his mind a good understanding of YOUR idea which he can then use to express agreement or disagreement (hopefully in terms as clear).  While it may be satisfying to express an idea as a poem, or with the minimum possible number of words, or in Homeric Greek, or possibly even as a palindrome ... the audience for whom that communication is successful is rather limited ... so as communication it fails.  It might be SELF-satisfying, but not successful communication.

<div class="content">Norman Norman Norman,  your posts here are so vexingly conflicted!  OY!<br><br>>>>  This old saw, I find to be exceptionally dangerous. In some sense it is true and has been written down in the Western tradition since Hesiod's _Works and Days_. The little truth it does contain is rather obvious and not very illuminating. But the moral implications can end up rather monstrous in my opinion.  <<<<br><br>Well, of COURSE the truth is obvious.  Truth usually IS -- once it is perceived!  As to how illuminating it is ... how illuminating is ANY truth?  It seems that the illumination mostly comes from the lamp by which it is read.  And what kind of monstrosity do you find lurking within.  The admonition is not: "You will be guranteed success if you follow the right formula."  Rather it is the CONVERSE of that:  "If you sow corn don't expect wheat."<br><br>>>>  From the plague which devastated Athens without apparent relation to the virtue of the people it destroyed to the Lisbon earthquake to the recent Haitian disaster,to why some people get cancer and do not recover and others do, etc, this idea can be rather ugly in my opinion especially when torn from the context of the entire complicated text in which lies.  <<<<br><br>I dunno, it always seemed rather obvious to me.  In fact, you are the first person ... in all of my years, who I've run across who had a problem with it.<br><br>>>>  The metaphor is faulty anyhow. Sometimes what you sow does not come to harvest due to conditions outside your control or you fortuitously find a crop spring forth you did not plant.  <<<<br><br>But that misreads the meaning of it.  It does not promise a positive outcome ... it warns that failing to note what you are planting might result in a nasty surprise.  The admonition would apply more to your concern is the one about the seeds on rocky soil that don't take root, etc.  A different metaphor for a different message.  These books of teaching stories have lots of them and they need to be applied to the right situations to be understood.  But then these stories were meant for the illiterate and uneducated so it might be hard to get past that if one has a monstrous intellect ;-)<br><br>>>>  Personally,I find this fragment much more in line with the way of the world:<br><br>"That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust."   <<<<br><br>But they ALL describe the world ... just different aspects of it.  There is no one platitude to cover all cases.  This one has an entirely different message to convey: "Don't expect that being good is going to gurantee success in all things."  Or, another similar platitude: "Virtue is its own reward."<br><br>This is exactly why that Brodie observation is most interesting: The world will SEEM to be exactly what you BELIEVE it to be.  Or put more prosaically: Your beliefs will provide the evidence you need to continue believing them.</div>

<div class="content">Norman,<br><br>>>>  Of course it implies that. As well as other things. What a snippet of text implies is based on its context. And that snippet of text has been contextualized in many ways.  <<<<br><br>Yeah, but the most basic and well understood meaning is that "if you want X, then DO X".  If you want good, do good.  If you want success, work for it.  If you want people to like you, then like people ... etc.  It is not really DEEP THOUGH ;-)<br><br>>>>  Maybe across the pound where nutty stuff like Calvinism, Transcendentalism, New Thought, Unitarianism, New Age, 12 Step Movements and what not did not catch on as much, you have more robust understanding of such words. In America, <<<<br><br>OWWW, my brain hurts.  First of all, let me just say that Seraphim is not across any pond.  There are damn few ponds anywhere NEAR where he lives ... in Arizona.  (And no, I'm not going to reveal the whereabouts of Mel.  LOL ;-)<br><br>But more than that, why do you lump that collection of ideas into one pot and call them "nutty".  I find some useful things in most all of them.  Hell, even the 12 step programs, dismal failures though they are, have something to recommend them.<br><br>>>> just watch when anyone is suffering, more and more our discourse locates the entire fault within the person. The suffering, even nowadays cancer, is result of ill deeds and now the thoughts! of the one who suffers.  <<<<br><br>Well, what ever is true is true.  I certainly think that posting universal causes for things is misguided.  I'd argue that even the "germ theory" has it wrong.  Clearly there are multiple causes for most things.  You can expose two people to the same "germs" and one will sicken and die and the other will go on about his business.  As to cancer, it is demonstrably true that thoughts can play a role in it.  People such as Louise Hay take it too far in that direction, but I assure you that if I had cancer I'd be working to improve my mental outlook as well as doing radiation or chemo or whatever else.  It is just as misguided to cite one thing as the cause as to exclude the possibility of one thing from having ANY causal role.<br><br>>>>  Our language of the pain and suffering of others revolves more around blame and justice than love, compassion, and healing.  <<<<br><br>Norman, for a person who aims at crafting words, that seems to be quite a bit of fog just there.  What on earth can one get from "love, compassion, and healing"?  Just above you are appealing to a "robust meaning" for words.  Geeez ;-)<br><br>>>>  Americans loves lines like one quoted above and the more Biblically astute find much comfort in story of Jacob and Essau as proof of the divine meritorious nature of the success they find in life and the pain and suffering others find.<br><br>When we Americans are at best, we blame entire populations of countries for natural disasters which befall them.  <<<<br><br>Oh good grief.  ALL AMERICANS blame entire populations?  Why not say that "All people blame others" and just leave it at that?</div>

One would have to narrow down the audience by time period, I suppose.  Certainly some parts of "The Bible" (and one could certainly pick nits about what that term refers to) were written after the time of some of the audience had passed.  Certainly the quotation that spawned this sequence was written later than Moses' time.  (Probably around 100-300 AD or so, I guess.  But then I've no aspirations as a biblical scholar.)  However, taken as a whole, the Bible is a collection of "teaching stories" for that particular culture which was a collection of various tribes (self-described) of nomadic peoples some of whom were more settled fishermen, or farmers or shepherds or whatever else they needed to do to scratch out a living.</div>

The "Bible" as I and most others, I believe, understand it is a comprehensive part of the Judeo-Christian cannon which did indeed serve as a ethical teaching tool to a wide audience, some of whom were nomadic and most of whom were fairly uneducated and illiterate who lived over many centuries.  Obviously some were merchant-traders.  Others had substantial education ... but they were not the primary audience.  They were the "establishment" and so "above" the whole debate ... as is so often the case.<br><br>I seriously doubt that the Jewish people object to being characterized as "nomadic tribes" as that is the way the Bible describes them at various points ... and they WROTE the damn thing!

You've mistaken it's meaning because of the erroneous image you have in your mind of wandering nomads doing what they can to scratch a living.   <<<<br><br>My conclusion derives from the words, not the audience, in fact.<br><br>>>>  Paul's meaning is precisely about the altering of one's perception, as you will find out if you read the original passage - Galatians 6. <<<<br><br>That is the whole problem with this "interpertation" stuff.  If you read the quote in context (which I did just to play along this morning) it is about circumcision and doing good deeds and not posing for others and a last self-serving bit about not causing him trouble because he knew Jesus.  For pity's sake!  You can interpret that thing anyway you like.  Ancient day "spin control".  ROTF ;)<br><br>Actually, the quote is what the quote is.  I don't think I've mistaken its meaning because it is a rather simple metaphor which does not require someone to interpret it.  That wold defeat the whole purpose of using a simple metaphor.<br><br>"As you sow ..."  An Action<br>".. so you will reap." a second action with a result from the first action.<br><br>That is pretty dead bang obvious to me!  Yes, it could have been a diatribe on recruiting techniques for Greeks, who knows how it was delivered.  But it is STILL about action and result.  It is still NOT about the psychological mechanism of belief.  It is about doing "good" or you will not GET "good".  It is not at all about: if you do good you will believe the world is a good place.</div>

<div class="content">FWIW before anyone gets too excited about the WWND bracelets - I was using the bracelet as an anti-Oracle - sort of a "WWND"? and then just do the opposite.  I've thrown it out anyway and switched over to my "WWSD" bracelet (Sparky being my golden retriever).   <br><br>Although I do seem to be chasing after balls a bit too much lately and have a strong desire to stop in the vicinity of trees, it's been pretty useful as he just works hard, plays hard, sleeps a lot, doesn't waste any time on other members of the species who aren't worth his time,  and is just basically happy and friendly for no apparent reason.<br><br>This excerpt from one of Brodie's articles seems kinda relevant here too:<br><br>"Sometimes I do want advice. I only take advice from people with lives I like. Most people, if they take advice, take it from people they like or people like them. I take the position that taking advice will make my life more like the life of the advice-giver. So I take financial advice from people who are richer than me (not some self-appointed “financial advisor”), relationship advice from men who are happy and fulfilled in their relationships (not Dr. Laura), advice on public speaking from successful public speakers (not self-appointed “speaking coaches”), and so on. <br><br>Finally, when giving feedback, it’s great to use the Communication Model. That separates out raw perceptions, interpretations, and feelings, making the feedback more accurate and easier to receive. Always use “I” and talk about yourself. Don’t attempt to philosophize and generalize that all human beings are the way you are. They aren’t. Thank God."</div>

For some reason you wanted to pursue me to the ends of the earth because of a tangential comment about the audience for the Bible being nomadic ... so here we are ... way out in the field smelling the wild flowers.  I think you pretty much took us here with when Paul wrote his letter and who he wrote it to and why he felt the need to write the letter in the first place.<br><br>I'm still back with the actual words and the contained metaphor -- which I'm STILL saying is not a bit like the idea that one's world view is influenced by one's belief in how one should live in the world.<br><br>But I have to say, the trip was nice and the wild flowers out here smell wonderful.   ;-)</div>

So you're about in the same position as I would be if I tried to win an argument about American Football with the coach of the Boston Red Socks.  <<<<br><br>O.K.  Flag on the play.  Firstly, I did not "admit" anything ... what I said was that I have no aspirations to be a biblical scholar.  So let's just clarify that point.<br><br>Next, I'm not trying to win an argument about New Testament Facts (for $400, please Alex).  I think it pays to keep in mind where this started.  I illustrated something with a quotation by Richard Brodie and you "simplified" it to a New Testament quote.  I then both an on point observation that the New Testament quote had a different point entirely and that in general, the purpose for the bible was to condense ethical teachings to simple platitudes that would be easily assimilated by the ignorant illiterate nomadic peoples who were it's main audience.<br><br>Following that it somehow took a hard left turn into angels dancing on the points of pins and such .. none of which things, no matter what the outcome of the discussion, would have the slightest bearing on my original comment about the meaning of the metaphor vs. the meaning of the Brodie quote.<br><br>I'm not sure why you think that I care who wrote which letter to whom and when and for what reason.  That seems to be far more interesting to you than me and if Paul wrote the letter to the Chinese in 1996 I not care a bit ...

Start with Transcendentalism in wikipedia and just click a bunch of links.<br><br>The scandal in American thought is that this thread and possibility of home grown thought derailed the more interesting and promising pragmatism. Oddly, in engagement with Continental thought, pragmatism is gaining favor once again. Even that old Kraut Nietzsche saw this when he said something to the effect: "In Emerson we lost a great Philosopher."<br><br>THOUGHTS INFLUENCING CANCER: This must be said loudly: BS. Never been demonstrated in any significant study. It is *utter* BS. In fact, I defy you to develop a method to test this. Whoever said this needs study double-blind, placebo methodology more and pick up a statistics text and look at the laughable "studies" which showed a CORRELATION between ATTITUDE and possible higher rates of survival from cancer.<br><br>Nothing like telling a family member of someone who died of cancer that their loved one just didn't think properly.<br><br>The American infatuation with the "law of attraction" is a cultural embarrassment. And yes it is a thoroughly American obsession, even if it is spreading throughout the rest of the Western world. <br><br>And I don't want to hear about "Eastern" "philosophy" having similar elements. That is a long and difficult argument involving translations of enormous and difficult texts written in languages which make Greek philology look like a snap, gulfs in history, and culture.<br><br>To be sure, what generally passes for "Eastern Philosophy" (as if something could exist) is throughly thought through and understood via Western metaphysics, especially the dominant variety as understood and practiced in America.

Ultimately I believe God is in control and it's silly and even immoral to blame someone for dying of cancer. Yet I do know that our bodies tend to obey our minds. Note that I said "tend to." This is not a certain relationship. I would have a hard time willing my body to grow a third arm. But I might have very little trouble willing myself into some kind of sickness either because I am depressed or have been told by a physician that I won't live. I'm not as skeptical of the research on beliefs and health as you are. We just have to be careful not to exclude biology (or in a Christian's case, the will of God). But is there a relationship? Absolutely. Even if simply a relationship between long-term fear and immune system suppression.
