<div class="content">Hello I begin to test DWM system. For the moment i find it easier then AF4 by the concept of little close list. What i feel interesting in the system is the historical reporting of task wich makes easy to follow my stuff and less tiring than AF4 (I dhad to read a lot things)<br>Anyway i found for the moment somme little inconvenient <br>There are some tasks you must do one day ex a call o someone who only be there a day. <br>There are some dead line un avoidable ex. A project you must present on a comity one day. <br>They are some urgent tasks you absolutely must do today even if it's rare it's happen !<br>So I like putting the tasks on today's page. <br>For the following of future tasks it's mainly like AF4 the only difference for me is that you don(t have a separate line, reported tasks have a life time of one week, new tasks have a life time of one month. But for for new tasks next urgent tasks can't have this life time. They must be done shortly so i guess it would be better to put theses on a very short time such as next 2 days ex urgent thing must be put the 2 days following. <br>I test the system and will come back to you in one week. (I put it on page date february 3 for it's a dead line for me :))) and an engagement.</div>
