<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2011-01-3 19:35</div>
<div class="content">In my post entitled, "Systems are losing simplicity" I mentioned that I had an AF1-like calendar that I keep. Scott Hutchins asked me to describe it, so I'm putting it here in this new thread.<br><br>First, here's the reason for having it. I wanted a calendar with my tasks, so that eliminated an electronic calendar. And, I found that printed calendars didn't give me enough space to write. And, I needed some way to keep reminding me of the appointment or due date or whatever. So, I came up with my method to eliminate the problems I was experiencing.<br><br>In a separate section of my Tasks notebook (separated by a divider) I have 6 pages. And, since I use Levenger paper, there is a blank column to the left of the lines on the page.<br><br>These 6 pages are Titled at the top:<br>– This Week<br>– More than One Week Away<br>– More than Two Weeks Away<br>– More than Three Weeks Away<br>– More than Four Weeks Away<br>– Long-Term<br><br>In the blank left column – starting at the bottom – each day I write the appropriate date for the sheet, scratching out the prior date listed there. "This Week" will be dated Today's Date + 7. "More than One Week Away" will be "This Week" + 7. Actually, after initially calculating it, the next day is simply a matter of incrementing the date – there's really no more need for calculation after that. <br><br>Example:<br>I have a trip coming up on February 25. It is entered on my Long-Term sheet.<br><br>When the "More than Four Weeks Away" page is dated February 25, I will scratch the trip out on the "Long-Term" sheet and write it in on the "More than Four Weeks Away" sheet. That means for an item that is entered on the Long-Term sheet it will be rewritten 5 times.<br><br>I don't mind the rewriting, because it is this that serves to keep this before me. By the time the event comes due it is thoroughly engrained in me.<br><br>That's pretty much it.<br><br>Matt</div>

<div class="content">You know it's not really AF1-like. It's just that the appointments, events, due dates, etc. are in list form. I didn't know what else to call it.<br><br>Matt</div>

<div class="content">Interesting...that's actually the way I have structured my AF lists in the past (now, backlog, future, maybe).  I have several meetings per day, so the re-writing scares me though.  But, thanks for sharing.</div>

<div class="content">If you have a lot of appointments, I assume they are work-related, right? If you are near your computer at work, then an computer calendar program makes sense. If they are sales-related and you must travel, then a calendar on your smartphone makes sense.<br><br>I have more projects with due dates and such, rather than actual appointments – though I do have a few. My method keeps me thinking about them subconsciously and my intuition factor them in when deciding what to do.<br><br>Matt</div>

<div class="content">Here's a picture of the paper and layout I use:<br><br><a href="http://www.levenger.com/PAGETEMPLATES/PRODUCT/Product.asp?Params=category=326-715|level=2-3|pageid=2806" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.levenger.com/PAGETEMPLATES/PRODUCT/Product.asp?Params=category=326-715|level=2-3|pageid=2806</a><br><br>I have a Levenger hole-punch, so I print out my own paper designed just like this, rather than buying it.<br><br>Matt</div>
