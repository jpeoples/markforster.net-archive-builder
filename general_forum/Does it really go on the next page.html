<div class="content">It's amazing what you can get done when you have a system that prevents you from procrastinating? ;) Today I find myself on page three. Column one is about half full. Column two has a couple of things in it.<br><br>So I pick a task. It's not a quickie; I don't finish it. Do I really enter it in column two of the *next* page? Or does it go on the *last* page (which happens to be the current page)?</div>

<div class="content"><<If you're on the last page, I believe it goes in the first available Col2 slot starting with page 1.<br>>><br><br>Huh? I asked a similar question and someone mentioned that it goes on the last page. For example: Page #4 is currently my last page. I'm on page 4, and do some work on a column one task. The task is not finished. According to the rules, I should place the task on the next page i.e. page 5. I was told to reenter the unfinished task in column 2 on page #4, To be honest, 2mc's understanding of what to do makes more sense. <br><br>Can anyone else clarify this? Thanks.</div>

<div class="content">Hi avrum,<br><br>2mc is correct -- if you are on the last page, and work on a task in column 1 and it is not complete....AND is not urgent....it should go in column 2 of the first page in your set.<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">What bothers me about this comment is that whatever page I'm on *should be* the first page in my set. (See <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1420265)" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1420265)</a><br><br>So:<br>* Urgent tasks go on the current page... if the current page is full, then on the first available page.<br>* Unfinished tasks go on the next available page... if you are currently on the last page then they go on the current page.<br>* There is no previous page because if you don't address anything on a page, everything gets dismissed. (Paraphrased... see official rules for clarity.)</div>

<div class="content">"No, ... if you are on the last page, then they go to the first available Col2 slot starting with the first page."<br><br>But the current page *is* the first page, because I can't leave a page until I address everything on it, thus closing that page. So if I'm on the last page, then the last page is also the current page is also the first page.</div>

<div class="content"><<But the current page *is* the first page>><br>Ah, so you've just started working with the system (or you have super long pages). Anyway, I had a similar question. My understanding is that you work the first page as both the current, and last page, until page 2 starts.</div>

<div class="content">avrum:<br>I concur with your understanding.<br><br>jFenter: <br>"I can't leave a page until I address everything on it"<br><br>This is mistaken.  The rule is "I can't leave a page until I address everything on C2"  The page remains, and with unaddressed tasks in C1.  So the current page is usually not the first page.<br><br>Another relevant rule goes like "If I don't address anything in C1, I must dismiss the page (after addressing everything in C2)."</div>

Or does it go on the *last* page (which happens to <br>> be the current page)?<br><br>You are on page 3. It is your last page. If you do a task, but fail to complete it, then you go to page 1 ... the real page 1....not some 'virtual' page 1... and beginning with the first entry in Col2 you work your way down until you come to an empty spot, and you put it there. If there are no empty spots in Col2 on page 1, then you go to page 2 and repeat the process.<br><br>I hope this is clearer.<br><br>Matt</div>

<div class="content">Okay. First of all, I apologize for being obtuse on this. Please don't think I'm being argumentative; I'm just trying to clear up my own confusion.<br><br>So let's walk through a scenario. Page 1 is full. 30 items in C1, 28 of which are marked through and two are highlighted. C2 has 15 items in it, all of which are marked through. Page 2 is full. 30 items in C1, none of which are marked through and none of which are highlighted. C2 has three items in it, none of which are marked through. Page 3 has five things in C1, none of which are marked through or highlighted. C2 is empty.<br><br>I start my day. I need to work on something. I have nothing on page 1 to look at, so I'm on page 2. Page 2 is my current page. I work on the three things in C2 (because my intuition led me to) and finish them completely. They get a mark through them. I intuitively start a task on C1 but don't finish it. I mark through it and rewrite it in C2 of page three. Everything's pretty straight-forward up to this point.<br><br>So I'm still on page 2 with nothing to worry about in C2. I look at C1 and nothing stands out. I look at page three and something stands out, so I start working on the task on page three. Now, because I did something on page three without doing something on page 2, doesn't that mean that I should dismiss the tasks on page 2? Quote: If no tasks are done in Column 1 during a visit to a page, all remaining tasks in Column 1 are dismissed.<br><br>So now page one has 28 "actioned" C1 tasks, 2 "dismissed" C1 tasks, and 15 "actioned" C2 tasks. Page two now has 1 "actioned" C1 tasks, 29 "dismissed" C1 tasks, and 3 "actioned" C2 tasks. Page three has 1 "actioned" C1 task, 4 "available" C1 tasks, and 1 "available" C2 task.<br><br>Since page two has no "available" tasks-- everything is either "actioned" or "dismissed", that makes page three my current page, correct? And page three is my current page, correct? Since page three is also the last page, if I don't complete a task, it goes into C2 on page... page one?<br><br>--------<br>If I move to the "next" page, then everything on the "previous" page should either have a line through it or be highlighted. (Rule #1 under "Dismissal".) If everything on a page is either marked through or highlighted, then the page is no longer active. (First sentence of the paragraph immediately preceding the "Dismissal" rules.)<br><br>If I take both of those rules into account, I do not see how I can have an active page previous to the page that I'm working. I'm repeatedly hearing from multiple people that this is not the case, so I'm definitely missing something somewhere.</div>

But first, "If no tasks are done in Column 1 during a visit to a page, all remaining tasks in Column 1 are dismissed."  Did you do anything in C1? Yes: one thing was started.  Therefore you don't dismiss the page.  <br><br><<I look at page three and something stands out, so I start working on the task on page three.

Doing something on page 3 has nothing to do with page 2.  Deal with page 2 on its own; and whether you do something or not on page 3 is only relevant to page 3.</div>

<div class="content">I'm starting to understand my confusion, I think. I'm a single-minded person. I look at my list and I find one and only one task to work on at a time. Look at list: work on one task. I've been considering this as a visit to the list. When I finish working on that one task, I make another visit to the list. Look at list: work on one task. That's another-- a different-- visit to the list. I may visit my list twenty times in a day, but I've been considering them all as individual, unique visits. That's why, Matt, that if I do something on page three, I feel like I skipped page two.<br><br>My interpretation of the rules tells me that on any visit to the list, if I don't work on the first page, then I should dismiss that first page. Since, for me, each time I look at the list is considered a different visit (again, in my mind), then I find that I must do work on the first page or it will get dismissed. This is why I haven't understood why others can have "previous" pages. I do understand now, though.<br><br>There are two instances where you can have previous pages. First, if you look at the list and pick out more than one item, then as long as one of your items is on the first page then the rest can be on any page at all. Second, if you can look at the list multiple times in a single "visit", then you can look at the whole list and not apply the dismissal rules until the end of your "visit". (So, I can work my entire list throughout the day and only apply the dismissal rules at the end of the day. If, by the end of the day, I haven't worked anything on the first page, only then do I dismiss them.)<br><br>I now have three approaches to choose from. I can choose to continue dealing with my list the way I have been... only with a clearer understanding of what's going on. Or I could pick multiple things from the list at a time. Or I could apply the dismissal rules at larger intervals, possibly on a daily or twice-daily basis.<br><br>Thank you for helping me understand better; I certainly feel like I've learned a bit. ;) And I appreciate your patience with me!</div>

<div class="content">It can be difficult to keep track of whether you have actually done a C1 task on a given page. I like Seraphim's little trick. He notes the date in the margin whenever he visits a page and ticks it when he first does a C1 task.<br><br>Incidentally, the situation you note can come up in two circumstances: when you have properly dismissed all previous pages (for instance, when you are suffering a task explosion and need to move quickly through the list) and on your first setting up the list. In both cases, I thinkk you put the C2s on the same page.</div>

<div class="content">I haven't actually hit the situation yet where I've met the problem of only having the one page on which to write in Col 2. But my general reasoning is as follows.<br><br>There are only two circumstances in which I am writing an entry in some page or other's Col 2:<br>1) It's urgent. In which case I want to get to it quite soon, so onto the current/active page it goes.<br>2)It's not urgent and it's an unfinished task. If I'm writing it now, then I've just done something on it, so I'm not going to be doing some more for a little while, so I don't want it on the current/active page where it may distract me.  (I don't know if this corresponds to Mark's reasoning).  Now this unfinished task is a bit of a problem if I only have the one page available. I can either put it on this same page (which I think is Mark's position on this) or I might (be a rebel and) put it on a new otherwise blank page (which will become my next active page after I finish with the current one for now).<br><br>This 'rebellious choice' means that I have a page with one or more Col 2 tasks on it but no col 1 tasks. I can't immediately find anything in the rules that explicitly proscribe this, but again I don't know what Mark intended, merely what he wrote, and I get the feeling that it conflicts with what some other contributors think.</div>

<div class="content">jFenter, the system totally is not concerned whether you work it non-stop or take a break and come back.  It doesn't matter if the day ended and a new day began.  <br><br>"Visiting a page" starts when you turn a page, and ends when you turn another page.  If in between those two moments you did anything in the first column, nothing gets dismissed.<br><br>In my experience dismissing a page is quite rare; usually only after most of the page is finished, after having gone around the entire list several times.</div>

I use a post-it note labelled 'current page' to keep me focussed where I am, and as I turn the page after actioning that C1 item and finding nothing else drawing my attention to it, I bring the post-it note with me so I know where I'm looking for a C1 item from before I leave that page.  In your situation with so few pages, it may not be such a big deal, but when you have a few more pages to follow it could help - especially if you decide to stick with one of your own variations of how you circulate through the list.</div>

<div class="content">jFenter:<br><<My interpretation of the rules tells me that on any visit to the list, if I don't work on the first page, then I should dismiss that first page. >><br><br>I could be WAY off base, but I think you might be saying that you are visiting page#1 (or the first open page) in your book/list each time you visit. My understanding is that you pick up again at whatever page you left off on. At that particular time, that is YOUR first page. I may be interpreting you wrong or it's also entirely possible that my understanding of the system is wrong. <br><br>I'll finish my thought in any case. :) <br><br>Page  #1 in my book/list has a couple open items, but the page I'm currently on and will resume working on when I finish this post is page #6. I keep that spot with a post-it note. I probably won't get off page #6 tonight. But let's say that I do and that I do something on page #7 too (nothing in C2 so maybe I pick off something quick in C1). I'd move my post-it to page #8 and pick up there tomorrow. <br><br>And for the sake of completeness, I have a little cardstock bookmark at page 10 where new items are recorded. The "end" of my list.</div>

<div class="content">jFenter needs to realize that the idea is not to "visit the list" but rather "visit the page." Put a paperclip or post-it note or flag or something on it, to remember which is the current page. When you come back to the list, continue working from the same current page. When you have taken some action on at least one task in Column 1, and have everything crossed off in Column 2, you may choose to go on to the next page. This is the "visit" we are talking about. When you turn to the next page (and mark it as the new current page), if you don't find anything you want to do in Column 1, the page must be dismissed. <br><br>The rare circumstance where there is only one active (non-dismissed) page is the same situation as when starting a new notebook, writing a new list.  I don't think there is any point to using Column 2 on a 1-page list for unfinished tasks. Just rewrite it at the end of the list (in Column 1). It's not urgent, so it doesn't belong in Column 2 of this current page. And there is no "Next page" yet, until the current Column 1 is filled.</div>
