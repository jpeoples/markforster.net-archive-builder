<div class="content">I've tried lots of apps and systems, including GTD and Things 3. I've recently been playing around with Autofocus, but it doesn't seem to lend itself to use in Things 3, so i'm wondering what app other people use to implement Autofocus? I'm on Mac, iPhone and iPad.</div>

<div class="content">stann:<br><br>Autofocus was designed to be used with paper and pen, specifically a notebook with 30+ lines per page. It is easy to duplicate this on something like Evernote without having to use a separate app.<br><br>However if you live in Europe, including the United Kingdom, you may find it better not to use anything dependent on electricity supplies this winter, as widespread power cuts can be expected.</div>

<div class="content">Just revisited my old AF setup on Dynalist, which I abandoned because you couldn't move items without paying for the pro version, but the developers seem to have made this a free feature so I don't see any reason you can't use it for AF for free. You could have a togglable/collapsible bullet for each page and a number of tasks of your choice subordinate to it. You can highlight for dismissal by changing the background colour. Mark the current task by adding a checkmark.<br>Worth a look anyway.<br>As you're in the Apple ecosystem, Swiftodo is worth a look as well.</div>

<div class="content">Checkbox, not checkmark.</div>

<div class="content">Workflowy has been the most flexible app I've ever used.  Lends itself to anything I want to create. Here are a few different use cases to demonstrate: https://youtu.be/8g7HC7IPq78 ,  https://youtu.be/Tjp8g4S9oVA ,  https://youtu.be/zGH4cPcJQJY</div>

<div class="content">stann:<br><br>It's good to see that you are on the Mac.<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAr8ReEUhM0" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAr8ReEUhM0</a><br><br>Now, the best app to use for Mark's systems is a Mac app and it is called FoldingText.<br><a href="http://www.foldingtext.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.foldingtext.com</a><br><br>It's almost like somebody tried to build an app just for Autofocus. Well, almost.<br><br>I also used Apple Numbers successfully. In general, spreadsheets are good. I declared hotkeys to automatically format cells as "dotted", "done" or "dismissed." That worked very well.<br><br>FoldingText is text-based and I text documents as well as spreadsheet preserve the line order of the entered tasks. Those "todo list" type of apps tend to resort everything all the time.<br><br>There is also Notational Velocity which let's you use the task paper @done tag to mark every line as, well, done.<br><a href="http://notational.net" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://notational.net</a><br><br>Try FoldingText and bend it to your will, I would say. Use headings to mark "pages" and so on.</div>

<div class="content">I second Workflowy. It contains my brain on there. I‚Äôve used simple scanning on WorkFlowy a number of times for work (since I‚Äôm at a computer much of the day).</div>

<div class="content">I also use workflowy with additional wfx powerpack. It has no constraints of other apps, is very intuitive and has cool features like mirroring from different lists. This makes creation of a long list a breeze while maintaining the same info in separate projects, notes, etc.</div>

<div class="content">Loving the idea of this method. <br><br>Do you think the iOS Reminders app would work?<br><br>- easy to move items around<br>- simple to delete when done<br>- quick add via Siri<br>- separate ‚Äúpages‚Äù for personal/work<br><br>The only missing feature is highlighting but could prefix with a symbol?!?</div>

<div class="content">There's also an app for iPhone & Mac called Dalo Task Manager that is specifically built for Mark Forster's longlist methods</div>

<div class="content">I tried putting together a web app for AutoFocus recently, what do you think? I'd love any and all feedback on how to improve it. https://avidrucker.github.io/pwa-autofocus-app/ PS. I think this addresses the OP's question, and also, I'm thinking to make a dedicated forum post for the web app as well.</div>

<div class="content">Nicely done, very smooth feel in use. Would it be possible to add two more buttons please ‚Äì one to save "tasks" from localStorage to a JSON file, in order to backup the tasks, and another to load the tasks from said file? I'm thinking of a situation where someone ends up with a large amount of tasks and having them all relying on that tab/instance is a bit scary.</div>

<div class="content">I like it but it is Mark's FV system not Autofocus.</div>

<div class="meta">2023-11-2 17:24</div>
<div class="content">Will do! @Chris<br><br>Thank you, I now can brainstorm what to do with updating the name. Is "AutoFocus FV" good, or is something else better you can suggest?  @ MR</div>

<div class="content">Avi,<br><br>Just spend 10 minutes reading this site. Each system has it's own name, and you can just name your app according to the system that you are implementing.</div>

<div class="content">I think what I have is closest to FVP after all, as described in <a href="../blog/The Final Version Perfected (FVP) Instructions - Reposted.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2021/11/16/the-final-version-perfected-fvp-instructions-reposted.html</a> I also read <a href="../fvp_forum/Summarizing differences between FV, FVP, FFVP - correct.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/fv-forum/post/2718577</a> but it doesn't quite clarify the differences for me.</div>

<div class="content">Hi @Chris, save and load from JSON are implemented üëçü§ì PS. You can import raw text items too</div>
