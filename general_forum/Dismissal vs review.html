<div class="content">Why do we need dismissal? It won't let us keep postponing forever, by forcing us into "now or never" situation. Threat of dismissal is strong incentive. Threat of review, I think, is much weaker. So why are dismissals replaced with reviews?</div>

<div class="content">The way I understand the instructions, they are threatened (the daily line you draw under a block) and considered deleted because you are not allowed to re-enter them until you have reviewed them (in review mode).<br><br>Review mode gives you a deeper understanding about why they are highlighted. At this point, you could re-enter them (maybe changed or broken up in a way that could be better worked with) or delete them altogether if you decide to ditch them.<br><br>A few days of working on the new dual mode AF, I can see the benefits of the review mode, though I have yet to switch to it!  The opportunity to address whether the task should remain or be deleted per Mark's guidelines does give you a chance to reflect on its importance.</div>

<div class="content">kiwiserg:<br><br>Actually there is no difference between Review Mode in the new instructions and the dismissal rule in AF2. It's just a change of name - though names can be very powerful.<br><br>Incidentally I'm on my 10th day of working the new instructions, and I have yet to put a task on review.</div>

Just to clarify - the daily line puts tasks on notice for review. But they are not actually highlighted and treated as deleted unless they have not been actioned by the start of the following day</div>

<div class="content">Mark, thanks! My post was a little unclear on the sequence. Line drawn first today on the unactioned block, then highlighted the next day if it remains undone. Got it!</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br>I love the Review Mode! It forces me to take action on the items that I "dismissed" before: I either "deleted" them or re-entered them by modifying them. In fact, after reading the new instruction, I went back to previously "dismissed" items under AF2, re-tagged them from "Dismissed" to "Review" (since I use en electronic method), and reviewed them (under the Review Mode). <br><br>My biggest issue (of which I was not consciously aware until the revised AF came out, BTW) on "dismissing" under AF1 and 2 was that I couldn't quite make out what the highlighted items were: "highlighting" to me means that the items require special attention, but aren't they supposed to be dismissed, deleted, gone for good, rather than nagging at me from my notebook every time I open it? The Review Mode allows me to put to permanent rest the troubled departed souls (i.e. the "unactioned" items) so that they won't come back to haunt me anymore. ;)</div>
