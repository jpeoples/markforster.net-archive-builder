<div class="content">Greetings Mark, are you still using this filing system?  Any updates on how it is going?  I'm curious as to whether you continued your original plan of 1 item per envelope or converted to Lawrence's system of multiple items per envelope.</div>

<div class="content">Yes, I am. I will be writing a review of it soon.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark, in about a week I'm going to be re-thinking the Noguchi system I have set up for myself--too busy to work on it until then.  I'd appreciate any thoughts you have of it since you posted on it several months back.  <br>I have found it to be just OK.  I don't know that there's much better, but what I end up with is a large group of folders that I don't review for months or even need, and then seem to have two other piles going on my desk-"important" and "not important"<br>What are your findings?</div>

<div class="content">This is a silly use for the Noguchi method, but when I hang my newly laundered clothes in the closet, they go on the left side of the rack. When I wear something, I return it at the end of the day to the left side of the rack. So I can always tell when I look at the rack what I've worn recently and, incidentally, what clothes I'm not wearing at all because they're migrating to the right side of the rack.<br><br>Oh well, it works for me and my nerd ways....<br><br>For file folders, I keep a small bankers box on my desk with folders for active projects, and the most recently used ones are at the front. But when those projects are done, I typically recycle the folder and throw out the contents. Long-term storage is in a bigger drawer and uses typical alphabetical organization.</div>

<div class="content">TK:<br><br>I'm still finding it works well for those things which don't fit well into my formal filing system. So it's excellent for stuff I use all the time (like my current Visa vounchers) and for things I'm working on (such as an application form) and also for burying stuff which I would feel guilty about throwing away but couldn't really care less about (such as Terms and Conditions from my bank).</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Mark, mine has kinda been the holder of both long lost projects, things I meant to read and haven't and the Terms and Conditions statements I can't throw away.</div>
