<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>In working with the task diary lets say today I have an item labeled call Ted re setting up meeeting in Boston.  <br><br>I have completed the task and made the call, but yet to hear back from Ted, should I schedule forward a reminder in a day or two, or do you just leave it not checked and review the previous pages with say a post-it flag on the pages with open items.<br><br>Also, where do you personally record and track your projects and the desired outcomes of them, ie the big picture of your business.<br><br>Thanks<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">Hi Gerry,<br><br>I recommend you (re-)read the chapter on the Task Diary in "Do It Tomorrow". In answer to your specific query, whenever you pass a piece of work to someone else you should make a note in your Task Diary to follow-up after an appropriate time period.<br><br>In answer to your second query, I don't find it necessary to track them at all. I remain on top of all my current projects and they are alive in my mind. There's a big danger of spending more time tracking and organising projects than in getting them done!</div>
