<div class="meta">2009-02-22 18:57</div>
<div class="content">AF tries to use the wisdom of the subconscious to identify tasks which are ready for being done, those tasks which stand out. Is it possible to reverse this a little bit and influence what "stands out"? What I mean is the following: Is it possible to plan a week in a way that on Monday tasks which are related to a project or an area of activities X should tend to stand out, on Tuesday tasks belonging to Y, etc. Is there a way to bring this kind of focus into the subconscious? Maybe this nonsense, but I got this thought from my subconscious when I waked up this morning :-).<br><br>Any thoughts?<br><br>Wolfgang</div>

<div class="content">Hi wowi<br>I, too, am having the same sticking points. I like a roadmap of my aims with flex time built in to accomodate the flow of the days..... I don't feel a definite sense of accomplishment and can't remember working the list....The clock simply says it's time to stop......<br>I'll give it a bit more effort....maybe it's a learnable thing if we're not naturally inclined to operate that way.....I guess I'll know soon enough....This is my third and last attempt.  Hopefully, I'll experience understanding rather than frustration!  LOL!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">@learning as I go: Here are my suggestions for planning the framework of work days:<br><br>I use my AutoFocus list, my calendar and time-boxing to keep my projects moving forward.<br><br>Hard deadlines are calendared on iCal. If there's a meeting scheduled and I need to prepare, then "prep for meeting with x" goes on my AutoFocus list. Ditto preparation for classes, etc. The class is scheduled on my calendar; special preparation or grading a project is a task.<br><br>For my ongoing projects I use time-boxing. I look at my week on Monday and capture blocks of time for my studio work, for example. Within that time box, I may do particular tasks which I've added to my AF list and I also do project planning and research and thinking which is part of my project management.<br><br>And, as Mark Forster has advised, if there's an urgent task, that gets put on a post-it note and added to my current page.<br><br>I work through the list all day, doing what stands out. I may do a task before my time-boxed period, do other tasks during breaks, and others after the time-boxed period is over.<br><br>Other days are hectic and very scheduled, and I have less discretionary time, but I'm finding that I still make good progress on my list.<br><br>For me, the best thing about AutoFocus is that I know what's on my list, because I'm actually reading it every day!  Before, I was great about "capturing" tasks, but terrible about actually reading my to-do list, much less making any progress on older tasks.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Liz<br>Are you saying that you insert your project tasks into the autofocus list? If so, do you devote a special page for that particular project or do you intermingle them with the actual list?  I'm confused.  Do you consider working on your projects/timeboxed efforts as discretionary time?  Maybe I'm a lost cause.......I'm going through the motions yet I feel like I'm groping in the dark....I'm not getting it.....I'll keep trying though (along with continuing my regular way for the important stuff)<br>thank you for taking the time to advise me.  I'll keep reading your post.....eventually, it might sink in!  LOL!  I'm not stupid, yet.....I just can't wrap my head around this.  I'm going through the motions, yet I'm not feeling the benefit and feel apprehensive because I never worked without specific aims to measure my success.  I suppose my aims provided both focus and motivation for me.  I'm not sure what I'm supposed to feel doing work chosen randomly...I'm still trying.......(I hope I don't go bald pulling my hair out!  LOL!)   Again, thank you.<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">p.s.  Do you have separate checklists for daily/weekly regular stuff?  I don't understand how to ensure that certain things get done in a certain time frame if it's not standing out unless you allow deadline pressures or pride pressures to force it to stand out.....That's not really planning....it's using external forces to guide the standing out process.....I'm confused......I'm not seeing the assurances behind the guiding forces that determine the standing out process..... I'll shut up and keep trying....maybe I'll experience a revelation that finally lets me understand the governing principles!  LOL!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">AF is just for discretionary time.<br><br>Scheduled, even timeboxed, activities need to be managed outside AF. This should really include any preparation for a scheduled activity unless there is a reminder set up so that you can schedule the preparation if it does not get done in AF. If you need to write down daily or weekly routine activities, then they are really scheduled too and fall outside AF.<br><br>Some people may be able to manage these things within AF - it will depend on number of items, speed of going through them, what standsout for them etc - but AF itself does not have a way of ensuring that these things are done. All you can really do if you want to manage them in AF is to try it and see how it goes. You will still need some sort of calendar, and, in practice, should be able to put all scheduled things into that.<br><br>If you operate an electronic system, you should be able to attach dates to items. It then becomes a simple matter, even within the AF system, of picking up those items that need to be done on any given day.</div>

<div class="content">Dm:<br><br>I most certainly use AF for the preparations for a scheduled activity. For instance I am travelling to Manchester tomorrow to give a seminar, and I have the item "Prepare Manchester" on my list. And from my past experience of AF I am totally confident that all the preparations will get done.</div>

<div class="content">learning as I go:<br><br>My experience of AF is that the closer I stick to the original instructions the better it works. I've experimented with many tweeks and they've always had the effect of throwing off the main point of AF which is that if I just enter everything onto the list I can trust the system to sort it out.<br><br>I use it for everything that doesn't have to be done at a precise time. Do I have to check my email at a precise time? No. So it's on the list. Do I have to reply to Comments at a precise time? No. So it's on the list. Do I have to do my German lesson at a precise time? No. So it's on the list.<br><br>My consistency in doing these and a myriad of other recurring tasks has improved gigantically since using AF. So has my ability to get projects sorted out, in spite of the fact that I'm using no project management "superstructure".</div>

<div class="content">Mark<br><br>You mention in another thread a task which prompts you to write down all preparatory activity for the next week or so. What happens to this list? do you work separately from it, or does it get processed as an amalgum of upcoming activity?<br><br>I think the point remains that AF may, or may not, manage untimed (or rather not precisely timed) activities. It may do so for 95% of users but no-one can be sure how it applies to them until they try it out. The less discretionary time there is, or if it frequently switches from famine to glut, the more potentially problematic it can be to make sure that everything is squeezed in.</div>

<div class="content">Dm<br><br>I can totally relate to your comment "The less discretionary time there is, or if it frequently switches from famine to glut, the more potentially problematic it can be to make sure that everything is squeezed in." That is definitely what I have found but I have also found, like Mark, that any tweaks I've experimented with have been detrimental to the working of the system as a whole and I now try to stick to the rules wherever and whenever possible.<br><br>However that's not to say that exceptions don't arise, or that I don't "have" to do tasks off list.  A specific issue arose from a phone call on Saturday which required response by Sunday.  I had limited discretionery time in that period so had to create a time block another way.  That was doable but was not what I would necessarily have done under AF.</div>

<div class="content">Coming back to the original question, I'm still interested whether somebody made experiences in the way that a conscious preparation of the week influenced the subconscious in the way how tasks stood out. <br>Wolfgang</div>
<h2>Reply by Christine B</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-02-24 12:45</div>
<div class="content">wowi<br><br>I think that our conscious thought processes significantly impact our subconscious thought processes but that the concept of "standing out" occurs once our subconscious has analysed the situation sufficiently.  For example, I have a "project" which needs a significant amount of thought as to how to manage it.  There are a number of people involved, many factors to look at, systems to set up, regular communication issues etc.etc.  It is important and needs to be managed even before the "correct" systems are identified and established, and I have the various tasks associated with it in my lists.  Those tasks have not been standing out BUT I am aware that my mind (both conscious and I assume subconscious) is focusing on the best ways to manage that situation.  At the weekend something occurred that required some of those tasks to be actioned.  Naturally I did so, using the common sense rule, because I had to.  However it was not "the right time" and although the tasks were done they werer not done easily and will still need some further action.<br><br>However, I want to get that project set up properly and my conscious thoughts are frequently on what to do and how to do it.  Whereas before, when I have looked at my lists there has been an uneasy feeling attached to those items, now, I can sense that feeling changing, almost to an excitement.  They have still not yet stood out but I can sense that they are getting poised to do so :-)  It is as if my focus on the how, rather than on just doing, has somehow released more creative ways to handle the whole situation.<br><br>A rather long-winded explanation I'm afraid but hope that may help to explain how I am finding AF working in that scenario ...... .  Not exactly a "preparation of the week" as in time, but more a mental preparation of the project, whilst allowing AF to find the time.</div>

<div class="content">Mark<br><br>I absolutely agree squeezing everything in "is" a problem but one that is not easy to resolve.<br><br>I have increased my discretionery time by default in that I (a) waste less time and (b) sleep less (an unexpected result of AF but I'm not complaining!)  However any further increase would be at the expense of others so not an option.<br><br>Reducing tasks - again for me that option with regard to new tasks is somewhat limited as a lot of those tasks come from outside my control.  However, as the backlog I had built up IS reducing then that will reduce the overload ...... just not immediately.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Wolfgang,<br><br>In his Feb 25 17:09 post here <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/673196" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/673196</a><br>Mark addresses the problem of contexts and what you should do when you come to a task that you are unable to work on because of the context you are in::<br><br>"Also bear in mind that if you have a policy (as I have) to dismiss items even if you can't do them, then that policy is going to be part of your subconscious thinking when visiting a page. For instance you might come to an item which you can do, but is one of the few remaining items on the page. If you know that you might not be able to do it next time you visit the page, then that will encourage you to do it while you can. Note that for this to work properly, you need consistent use of the policy."<br><br>What "stands out" will depend very much on what we do and do not take to be constraintst. If we _know_ what the AF rules are, then we take them as a constraint--both consciously and subconsciously. If my constraining rule is that I must dismiss an errand if it's the last item on the page and I can't leave my workplace, then that will affect what subconsciously stands out when I review the list. I'll be much more likely to subconsciously choose that errand sooner because my subconscious (which is calculating costs and benefits and probabilities) factors in the rules when it chooses. <br><br>This, I believe, addresses some of your question, Wolfgang, about influencing the subconscious. In fact, I follow the AF rules entirely because I believe they influence my subconscious in a highly beneficial way. The rules of AF are constructed to get me to do useful things that, if I didn't follow the AF rules, I'd be much more likely to avoid doing. Consciously, I know that I should do them, whether I am doing AF or not. But, with AF, my subconscious nudges me a little harder to do them.</div>

It is about having periods where the amount of discretionary time is insufficient to do all tasks with a deadline AS WELL AS other tasks. As I said for some people this may never be a problem because their operation of AF means that everything gets done before the deadline. For others this may not be so, and for a larger number of people (including myself) there is a fear that AF won't get it all done in time without some extra info. It's not a problem for me since I work electronically and deadline dates are noted where they exist; I'll generally know what deadlines are coming up and do a regular search just to make sure I've not missed anything. I have to keep a close eye on my Calendar anyway to know what appointments I have. Short deadlines and/or a small amount of discretionary time for a while means that the deadlined tasks will be taken out of AF. Total effort required for this extra is minimal, but it gives me total confidence that everything is done in time and allows me to run everything except timed tasks from AF.</div>

<div class="content">I've re-surfaced this issue of"standing out" as I found some science for "standing out" that I found interesting:<br><br>"If we can train our system to bias the things that ‘jump out’ we will automatically act in a preferred way, i.e. we can bias the way our future selves respond; even if at the time we are not consciously making decisions. "<br><br>at <a href="http://www.cleanlanguage.co.uk/articles/articles/312/1/Self-nudging/Page1.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.cleanlanguage.co.uk/articles/articles/312/1/Self-nudging/Page1.html</a><br><br>This seems to tie in nicely with the "Dreams" idea of our future self. The article goes on to suggest that a goal is not something we aim for but a context to frame current decisions and that a "done" list can aid motivation more than a goal. The done list and the future vision would seem to set up a useful bias for what "stands out". Our choice of action is influenced by so much more than information and values such as social norms, cognitive biases, ease vs effort and time vs cost. They all lead to "standing out".</div>

<div class="content">I just heard some about this. We always have a mental bias in some way or another, and this affects what stands out. Deliberately influencing that bias is called Priming.  We can prime our thinking in favor of urgent tasks, tasks of a certain subject, high energy tasks, tasks starting with W, or tasks doable with just pen and paper. We can also prime the pump for picking more tasks we are enthusiastic about.</div>

<div class="meta">2012-01-4 18:04</div>
<div class="content">Alan,<br>Have you read the Halvorson book _Succeed_?<br><br>Probably half the book is about phenomena like priming. Like Mark, she talks about using your unconscious mind to help achieve goals.<br><br>One of her methods has been discussed in another thread. She encourages us to speak about or write about what (specifically) we will do, where we will do it, and when we will do it. E.g., I will memorize Spanish vocabulary words with my computer off (what), at my desk (where), every weekday between now and May 1 from 9:30 a.m. - 10:00 a.m. (when). She calls this "if-then" planning.<br><br>Another method is to read about, see pictures of, or listen to audio tracks about people who have accomplished what we want to accomplish. She terms this "goal contagion."<br><br>In the typical priming experiment, the subject is never aware of the fact that they have been influenced. Halvorson cites many studies where subjects do word scramble exercises before being asked to engage in some other behavior. <br><br>Depending on the meaning of the words that they unscramble, their behavior changes. If they unscramble words related to cooperation, they behave more cooperatively. If they unscramble words related to competition, they behavior more competitively.<br><br>Like you, she urges us to deliberately prime ourselves. This means that we need to expose ourselves to cues that will trigger the behaviors we value (goal contagion), or plan now to be triggered by cues some time in the future (if-then planning). <br><br>People often mention that this forum (and others) are prototypical examples of displacement activities. Rather than be productive, people come here to write about being productive.<br><br>Certainly that is a danger that should be guarded against. But, on balance, I think that this forum provides a place for us to think about the obstacles that we and others face as we seek to achieve our goals, and how we can overcome them. Thinking about such things increases the likelihood of achieving them precisely because it primes us to find opportunities for achievement.</div>

<div class="content">Bernie:<br><br>It's a bit more than just the "Unfinished" category I think. It would also include recurring tasks. And also tasks which are related to finished tasks.<br><br>For instance, you have a task:<br><br>Watch Episode 1 of BBC's Frozen Planet series.<br><br>When you've finished that, you will then probably move on to Episode 2 and then through all 7 episodes (only 6 in the States!). So you have a continuing thread of tasks.<br><br>But you might also be interested in some of the facts that are covered in the series. So you might also have tasks like "Research humpback whales" and so on.<br><br>Of course this is just an example, but it could also apply in a business context.<br><br>A good system is one that keeps this sort of thread going, not by compulsion, but simply by encouraging it and putting no obstacles in its way.

In my practice such pages are outside the list, and the list contains the ready exemplars of that project.<br><br>So my project page takes all those tasks I haven't done and aren't ready to do, and puts them away.

<div class="content">MF: "By that I mean that once an action has taken place there is a natural tendency to either repeat the action or to take a similar action leading in the same direction."<br><br>I would describe that as just as being in a frame of mind.  It's very important to support it. AF supports it up to a point with the 'standing out' and the ability to write "work on tax return (page 128)" and write all your tax return notes on that page.<br><br>This is akin to the "free form note book" or the "project focus" thread I posted.

<div class="content">Mark Forster said:<br><< project pages are examples of how we squash developing threads by putting the emphasis on what we haven't done, rather than on what we are doing >><br><br>As a software programmer and as the sole developer in the company, it's projects that cause the most problems for me. In my job, a "project" contains multiple "milestones" (goals, or "what we are doing") and each milestone has multiple tasks. Add in task dependencies and you can understand why I use project management software just for this.<br><br>The problems I've had are that the PM software shows me way too much; I see everything, not just the tasks I'm able to do. Dumping all of the tasks into an AF list has the same problem. If I just put the project name into the AF list, it doesn't show me enough information; I lose sight of the individual goals. Having many possible "next actions"-- at least one per milestone-- is what overwhelmed me with GTD. Putting the "next actions" into an AF list helps, but then when I complete a task, I have to remember to go back to my PM software and find any new tasks that were dependent that are now doable and add those to my list. So then there was too much "work" involved in just maintaining the system.<br><br>Add to this the fact that single tasks can take anywhere from 30 minutes to 4 hours to complete and that most tasks need to be done in one sitting (I still say that distractions are a programmer's bane), and you can start to see why I've been looking for "something better".</div>
