<div class="content">I'm in a particularly hectic period--things are happening very fast on many fronts. I'm loving the new revised AutoFocus. But I find that now and then I get a little anxious over what might be lurking within my list that may be becoming urgent. So I find myself scanning the list to see if there's something, and if I find one I go ahead and do it "out of order." I'm wondering if I am undermining something by doing this. Perhaps I should add a task: Scan list for urgent items? Or am I missing something that would handle this?</div>

<div class="content">How long have you been using AF (any version)?<br><br>I had those anxieties at first, in a general sort of way, but once I got used to the system, and came to trust it, those anxieties evaporated (mostly).<br><br>The anxiety does come back if I've been away from my list for a while (a day or two).  In that case, I might do a quick scan for urgent items, and move them to the end of the list.  But even after an extensive break, I find I usually don't need to do that.  RAF makes this even less of an issue, since it tends to find those urgent tasks all by itself.</div>

<div class="content">Stan,<br><br>One of the AF instructions (I no longer remember what version or if it was an add-on or a suggestion or what ;-) was to scan the list first thing in the morning to get a handle on your day.  As Mark would put it (perhaps) to prime your subconscious.<br><br>In my case, I use that scan to pull off crucial items to a small card I keep with my pocket list so I'll continually see the very hot items and don't have to wait until I get to them the next time through the list.  That is just my way, others disagree.  Do what works ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Stan<br><br>Being a big fan of Mark's closed list approach that formed the basis for AF1, I find myself (in Reverse mode) scanning one page at a time before settling in on the task that stands out the most relative to the others.  Even though there's no threat of dismissal by not doing anything on the page (unlike AF1), I find myself being less overwhelmed by this approach than having the whole list to pick from. <br><br>Andy</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the suggestions. I suppose the way one could handle this without modifying the system would be to consider the feeling of anxiety that there is something urgent lurking somewhere in the list as a sign that no task is ready to be acted upon until the task that is causing the anxiety is discovered and acted upon or until the feeling goes away. In that way, a full scan can happen at any point within Reverse Mode or Forward Mode.<br><br>I still have a feeling that I'm missing something, but at least this approach satisfies my need for assurance that nothing is getting neglected. I missed the first-thing-in-the-morning scan initially, but really appreciated the "permission" to get right into urgent tasks during this period of urgent tasks proliferating much faster than is usual for me.</div>

<div class="content">I used to go back more on a page by page basis with the initial AF2 reverse mode but found that just dropped away.  I now find myself actioning tasks so much more easily and for the first time I can remember have been through all of my pages twice today.  I started AF2 with my old list with 362 open tasks and around 60 active pages.  As of now I have 105 tasks and 39 active pages.  It seems that RAF has the ability to streamline the lists so much more easily, and the reverse mode eliminates the need for duplication of items which I found necessary under AF1 in order to ensure I could action repeating tasks regularly.  I rarely feel the need for a formal list scan as I find myself becoming more and more familiar with the content.<br><br>I'm sure Jacqueline will be greatly relieved at my page reduction!! :-)</div>

<div class="content">How about creating a task the says scan list?</div>

<div class="content">See Stan scan.<br>Scan Stan scan....<br><br>Sorry couldn't resist.... <br><br>I am also in a hectic period at work (one that feels like it may never end). Reverse AMode works fine for me here, often I get to an item and think, "Yeah, I should do this, but I *think* there is something I should do instead..." so I continue backwards until I find that item. By following the rules, I am doing the scan that I need.</div>

<div class="content">I'm proud of you Christine!  I've had the opposite effect with RAF - I'm up to 17 active pages and 227 open tasks.  Back to AFC + AF1 for me.<br><br>Stan, have you tried doing a quick scan before leaving work?  I used to do that when I was more into my job and worked with a schedule plus master task list.   I'd get great ideas on how to do things on the drive home from work.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br><br>Wow! I have less active tasks than you now!!  I have to confess though to a degree of anxiety over "too few" items but I do like having less pages :-).  One thing I am finding is that I am more selective about what is going on my list.  I don't mean that I am "grading" tasks but in some way I am more aware of what is feasible within a relative timescale, and I am using my schedule more to remind me when to add certain tasks. I also feel I have gotten back to using my project planning more effectively as I am more likely to enter complete tasks (e.g. Project x) than all of the constituent parts.  I guess I am more confident of seeing everything new than I had become with AF1 so it is easier to action "little and often".</div>
