<div class="content">You may have noticed that i haven't write anything on this forum since a long time...<br><br>I just wish to tell you it's just because I was testing a way to make collaborate two systems ie GTD and AF and i have to tell you I think i got it ! This post give some tips be free to add yours it may be interesting for all of us. <br><br>Q1 How do i manage my project ? : On omnifocus. I conscienciously write all of them. And I put in each all my MIT and all tasks to be followed in the future. <br><br>Q2 How do I manage my contexts ? : On AF with just a notebook. I write everything on my task notebook a A4 wih in the margin general context such as @Wait, @DO, @Call, @someday. <br><br>Q3 How do I make it living on AF I use only a long list it's AF1 process except I highlines the contextes in differents colors @Wait is green, @Someday may be = dissmiss for me = orange, @Pink = everything with need to be done very quick such as pay the taxes, A very important call....<br><br>Q4 How do I control ? I use frequent review one per day were I cross everything I dont want or dont need to do and report on OF everything in the future.  I use process my morning process is repport on AF from AF every deadlines, affect a color if it must be done today or fastly, repport things to do about emails on AF + the items coming from my yesterday inbox- End of the day process repport on my historical note book a short summery of what happened today and what i plan to do tomorrow. Plan on AF4 all tasks wich much be done by now if they aren't<br><br>Q5 Use GTD for the rest project plan,  Inboxes (I have one for today and one for tomorrow (dit) <br><br>Theses technics make me efficient since 3 month and are easy to do. <br><br>I have decided to forget every digital solution for contexts either on omnifocus either on taskpaper or .page or watever....<br><br>My A4 AF note book is the most important piece of my own organization. It goes everywhere with me like my general note book were i take notes about all projets.... One per page. <br><br>Hope this help...<br><br>And you, what tips or process do you use ?</div>

<div class="content">Looks good to me.  I'm still in flux over these things and perhaps I'll pull ideas from you.<br><br>Q1 Project ? Named in AF4, with a list of some tasks I can work on.<br>Q2 Contexts ? I don't bother.<br>Q3 Highlighting, I like the idea, but not sure it's good.<br>Q4 Control?  I go through the list regularly, so review isn't necessary.  At work I do log my activities daily, and ponder what activities I'll do tomorrow.  I don't plan out tasks, but I do think about the scope and place of big projects.  My aim is to have an evolving map of where we are headed.  I won't plan activities by the map, but its existence will influence my choice of activities to AutoFocus.<br>Q5 Inboxes: AF4 is my inbox.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jupiter! <br><br>My current AF4 set up is very simple. Rejected items get the highlighter treatment. <br><br>Page divided down the middle: left = AF4 Entry, right = notes area<br><br>AF4 entries are by Keyword in capitals (e.g. FITNESS) with a Sub Root for recall / catagorisation in lower case (e.g 10K run Chesterfield). <br><br>Written thus:  FITNESS / 10K run Chesterfield<br><br>I write all my notes in the same A4 Spiral bound notebook, starting from the back. On these pages the Keyword and Sub Root are written at the bottom of the page. I allocate a page per topic, where neccesary. When the page gets filled up it can be removed and placed in a file, if needed. <br><br>Credit to Gerry (Ultra Simple Guide to Time Management) for this idea. <br><br>Gerry describes the use of RAW in his method for note making (Result, Action, Waiting for) but I prefer the use of DAP (Data, Analysis, Plan) which is often used for recording health care interventions. If I'm waiting for something it goes onto my AF4 list if I need it within a few days. Otherwise it goes on my calander. <br><br>My files are labelled in the same way, e.g. FITNESS / 10K run Chesterfield <br><br>Works for me. And this is about as simple as I can make it. <br><br>Good luck!</div>
