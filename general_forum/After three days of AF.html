<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">I went back to work on wednesday after a few weeks of vacation.  <br>I had asked my secretary to schedule only a few patients, to enable me to clear the backlog of work that was laying around.  (E.g, I hadn't been able to clear my mailbox since my previous holiday - there were messages from november still unread.)<br>She did a wonderfull job, by stating I was 'out of office' for two more days, and only today, I had some appointments.<br>The combined result of my secretaries effort and AF, is that I seem to be running out of tasks now.  The only things left are a few articles I should read.<br>I would be able to leave my office two hours earlier, and still know that there is (almost) nothing left to do for next week (apart from seeing my patients of course).</div>
