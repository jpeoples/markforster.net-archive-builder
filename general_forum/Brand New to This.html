<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-02-6 15:07</div>
<div class="content">Hey yall (I’m from the South),<br><br>I only found out about Mark’s work 5 days ago, so I began with AF4 on Wednesday—after I finally figured it out.  Then I became quite curious about the new DWM method and figured that there is no reason not to transition into it.<br><br>I am so new at this that a bit of confusion remains after reading the instructions and many of the past posts.  So I am looking to you guys to instruct me and point me in the right direction.  Let me give you the way I read how to proceed, and then you let me know where my brain is muddled.<br><br>I have my closed and open lists from AF4.  I will take all of these entries and enter them on the March 6 page.  As I have more new items created, I also add them to March 6.  As I create re-entries, I place them on the page that is one week ahead (Feb. 13) and after today, this will become a closed list along with March 6.  <br><br>If that is correct, what then?  Do I simply cycle through all the lists that have been created by considering each item from Feb 13 to March 6 and tomorrow I scan and process Feb 13 and 14 and also March 6 and 7 and so forth hereafter?  In AF4, the closed and open lists are processed in a very specific and disciplined way.  It seems that this method is a departure from that sequence in regards to considering each entry.<br><br>Is this as clear as mud?  And where has my thinking gone wrong.<br><br>Tucker</div>

<div class="content">Hi Tucker<br>Welcome!  March 6 isn't intirely closed because on Feb 27 you might add some re-entries, see?  Of course, Feb 13 will be closed at the end of today's session(s). Yes, you cyle it as one running list even though it's comprised of different pages.  Of course, you can turn it into a game by challenging yourself to close out days if you have that kind of wiggle room timewise.<br>We're all learning it together.  It's quite illuminating to read the various posts.  We've got some great thinking and tinkering going on here!  I'm enjoying learning DWM as written so far.  Good luck!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">It seems like you've got it.  I wouldn't focus on open/closed or on what day you are working from.  Just cycle through all the pages.  Right now, most are empty, but over the next month most will have entries added to them.<br><br>Be sure to have TODAY, REENTRY, and NEW tabs for Today, One Week Ahead, and One Month ahead.  Some people have trouble remembering where to put stuff or just finding the right page.</div>

<div class="content">Mark's said before just to start at "today" and read through the lists consecutively until you get to "today+30". Do whichever tasks stand out as you read through them.</div>

<div class="content">This is probably an inane question -- but why do you need a TODAY list at all?    Since all tasks are entered into "Today PLUS 30" and once they're done they're either crossed off OR crossed off and re-entered at "Today PLUS 7" -- isn't a TODAY list superfluous?</div>

<div class="content">Well, the first week, there's nothing on the 'today' list. OTOH, next week, Feb 13 (feb 5 +7) will be 'today' and there may be open tasks from Feb 5. And next month, when March 5 is 'today', there may be open tasks from Feb 5 and Feb 26.</div>

<div class="content">If you remove old pages, you won't need a Today tab.  <br><br>But if you don't, it represents your start point.  You don't get to look at pages earlier than Today.  The tab just marks that for you so when you get to the end, you know where to go.</div>
