<div class="content">My deepest condolences to Mark and his family. He has made an incredible difference in my life. I'm still using his original autofocus system. "May the divine assistance descend upon us and remain always with us, and may the souls of the faithfully departed, through the mercy of God, rest in peace."</div>

<div class="content">My heartfelt condolences to the family.<br><br>Mark was such an influential and original thinker, both widely recognized and, perhaps more importantly, quietly transformative in ways that are less visible but deeply felt by those who followed his work.<br><br>I don’t know how we will continue this quest without him, perhaps through a new circle or group to carry the spirit?</div>
