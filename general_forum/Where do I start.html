<div class="content">I went on this site looking for help in both routine things and other areas that come up as the time goes along.  I have read a lot of the posts and although AF gets lots of positive endorsement there seems to be people who feel Mark Forster's other books are good/better for some things.  I have lots of discretionary time which is not good for me as I can easily resist the routine items and procrastinate on the other items.  Any ideas for me?</div>

<div class="content">I'd try AF and see if it works for you.  It didn't work 100% for me but I gained some practical ideas that I use eg you can start a task on your list and stop when you like, then cross it off and re-enter it.  It is liberating to do that and I get a sense of achievement.  Now to the next person that might be a useless tip - they'll pick up something different from AF or even find its the system for them.</div>

<div class="content">I'd say AF if lots of discretionary time, DIT if more structure needed, just a personal opinion.</div>

<div class="content">TJ, I've found sometimes that the more discretionary time I have, the harder it is to get anything done.  Like those weekends where you don't really do anything at all and wonder where the weekend went.  I have found scheduling things to do works the best for this and then fitting AF in where you have unscheduled time.  <br><br>If you have lots of discretionary time, I doubt a system like DIT would work because if you have discretionary time, you're not dealing with inputs outside of you or reacting - you have to be more proactive as you're self-generating your work/leisure. <br><br></div>

<div class="content">As a newbie solopreneur - I have a lot to do, but a lot of time to do it in. AF is a great system for this type of predicament. At the end of the day, you still need to crack open your list. Something I struggle with on a daily basis. But once I get going, the system respects the time, energy and motivation I have to do stuff.</div>
