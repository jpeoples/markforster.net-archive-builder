<div class="content">It seems as though Triple Task was only here a very short period of time before it was replaced by SF and it was not really tested.  I am having a difficult time seeing how SF has the same focus and simplicity that TT has.  It seems the right hand column is another long list and mix of tasks without a true way to simply focus on the important things that need to be done.  Maybe I am the only one that connected with TT as I have been using the rule of three for a long time.  My fear is the best time management system I have seen quickly is replaced and not getting its due.  <br><br>Is anyone else using a TT variation and seeing results with it.  I for one have never been as productive as when using it.  <br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">Gerry:<br><br>I found 3-T plus AF-4 was a very powerful combination. But I was keen to see whether I could bring some of the same focus to AF1.  <br><br>I don't think it's right to say that the right-hand column is another long list. What goes in it is re-entries and "now" tasks. That should be relatively few tasks. I've never had more than two or three active tasks in my right hand column at the same time.<br><br>It brings much the same focus on a few tasks as 3-T does, but at the same time gives space to clearing routine and urgent tasks out of the way.</div>

<div class="content">I am still TT'ing it. While I used, enjoyed and was productive with AF1 back in the day, I have found a digital AF4 implementation that has been working flawlessly for me, so I don't have a desire to implement an analog AF1 system.<br><br>The addition of the three task method to AF4 has allowed me not only to focus on the "right" things to get done today, but I am getting more done than ever before.  Yee-haw!</div>

<div class="content">One last thing -- I'm already seeing signs of this SAF list growing faster than I can work it.  Not nearly as bad as AF1 or AF4 but it doesn't seem to have the automatic load-balancing that DWM has.  But again, maybe I'm missing something.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim,<br><br>My concern was just what you are experiencing, an expanding list in the right column.  For me I like the "cap" on the number of task I focus on this forces a true decision as to what you allow onto the TT page and get you focused on whats important, yet you have the peace of mind in knowing everything is captured in the system for ultimate processing.  By staying on the TT page most of the day, you also do not have the clutter of long lists to distract you.  <br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">hi gerry, <br><br>i believe in the 3 task approach. i've been so fed up with long lists of tasks that at the moment i'm basically doing the 'not insane to do list' (check out on american digest). one task is 'in & reviews' which basically covers incoming work and review items. i don't need to do this task *every* day though. <br><br>my conclusion has to be that a long list of tasks adds to my procrastination and does not diminish it. for me, less tasks equals greater focus and less dithering.<br><br>i'm boosting my battered self esteem by noting my 3 achievements for the day in a journal - you know where that idea is from ;) and it feels great to know i'm *done* for the day.<br><br>however.! i really like your idea of capture & triple tasks (notebook front and back) but tell me how is it working for you? and crucially how do you track / mark completed tasks from the capture section? and finally, do you keep 'topping up the tasks' when you have completed two or three of them?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Leon,<br><br>I saw the American Digest site and it is in my opinion very much like the TT page<br><br>I am still following triple task as I outline on my website and it is working great.  If something moves from capture to TT page I do cross it out of the capture section.  If for instance I need to call someone and I get their voicemail, I will cross it off of the TT section and will write in the capture section, W - Phone call from Bob.  When reviewing the capture section my mind lets me know if the call back is overdue and I need to put into TT call Bob again.<br><br>I follow a few rules.  <br><br>I add tasks to the TT page when there are one or less (ie I did all three).  <br><br>I never write a task directly onto the TT page, I always put it into the capture section.  <br><br>This rule serves as a buffer so I am sure it really is an important task to do.  Also, I am very careful to write the Triple Tasks as tasks that can be completed in a day or less.  This way you rarely end a day with unfinished tasks on the TT page.  I am not using it to put things like work on project X. I define what I am going to do on Project X that can be completed that day.  So I would not write work on building new house, I would write call three architects and ask them to send their qualifications.<br><br>The TT page may end up having several items a day on it, just 0-3 at a time.<br><br>This system is the best I have worked and really ties what I was trying to do with my previous ebooks together.  The key is in the disciple to stick to the TT page and its rules, the capture give me peace of mind to know I have everything identified.  <br><br>TT is really very simple and easy to use.  Good luck <br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">hi gerry, sounds great!<br><br>i write my 3 tasks on a post-it note and stick this into my diary. i am using a page per day diary (scheduler / calender). I enter appointments & there is space for essential notes, e.g. voicemail messages. i put my 'waiting for' items as review items on the appropriate date and deal with these as a batch as part of my 'in & reviews' task. i've got a tray labelled 'review' for this purpose.  simple but effective. <br><br>though i may be tempted to try your system though ;)<br><br>best of luck to you</div>

<div class="content">In 3 months of operating my system, I'm observing a steady trend of consolidation and completion. In short order I think I may only have a dozen things left to do, and of those I pick 2 or 3 big ones each day. Now behind those big ones are reams of things I might do later when the current ones are complete, but each of those need to wait for these and so don't come into consideration.  It's quite interesting how it evolves, but the net effect seems to make ongoing maintenance trivial.</div>

My list is a mix of consolidated tasks (eg. "HP6530B customizing") and tasks can be completed in one go (eg. "HP6530B disable USB autorun.inf"). When it stands out I'll either do the latter in one go, or consolidate into the former by linking to an associated checklist (it's easy to link external text file HP6530B.txt to the former task in DWM.xls). I'm still just looking at 3T. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">ok gerry, <br><br>so, what is the *exact* mechanism you use when you write your triple tasks? for example, do you complete all 3 before writing 3 more? do you close the list, i.e. underline the 3 tasks before starting 3 more? do you cross each task off or put a check mark by it? i guess you would need to leave one task on if it cannot be done until later in the day?<br><br>and, on average, how many tasks are you getting through per day? do you call it a day at a certain point in the day, for example when you leave work? <br><br>sorry for all the questions, i love details & i really like your approach to triple tasks.<br><br>by the way, i would find tearing the top corner of a capture section page out useful to indicate that there are no further actionable tasks on the page. or doing what mark proposed in AF1 - putting an X in the top corner. <br><br>i also think the capture section would be very useful for holding onto reference information and useful checklists.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br>In the example you've given you have only filled 5 lines of column 2. After you've moved on to the next page, only 3 live tasks are left in the column. That doesn't seem too much of a problem to me.<br><br>However I notice that you don't finish a single task that you start from column 1. Obviously if *every* task you have in column 1 is going to take two or three goes, then column two is bound to get overwhelmed.<br><br>Looking at a typical completed page from my own notebook I see that out of the original 31 tasks in column 1, only 9 needed to be re-entered in column 2. The rest were completed on the first go. Of the 9 which were put in column 2 three were dealt with on the next go.<br><br>In addition I added six "now" tasks, three of which were finished on the first go. <br><br>Two tasks were transferred to the next page (remember I am dealing with totals for  a completed page here, not one pass)<br><br>Out of the 31 lines in column 2, I used 21 on a total of 15 separate tasks. Ten lines remained unused.<br><br>(I've done my best to make the above figures accurate, but it's quite difficult. They shouldn't be too far off though)<br><br>My conclusion from all this is that if you want SuperFocus to work for you, you need to write a much higher proportion of  your tasks in such a way that you can finish them in one go.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Leon,<br><br>I add tasks when there are none or one left.  So sometimes when I have one task left, I will just go ahead and do it and then go into the capture section to find three more.  Obviously, this is a preference but for some reason it works, I never add a task with two left as I feel this is a form of procrastination.<br><br>I get between three and nine important things done a day.  Note I usually do not write general tasks like review emails.  If there is an important email to review ie it came with a contract I need to review, that will go into capture and then TT.  When I have finished enough important stuff, I will just review emails.<br><br>I will call it a day when I leave work, I try to get the important personal stuff done during lunch breaks, like I wrote about in one of the ebooks, so home time is family time or hobby time.<br><br>In my system, completed pages and TT pages at the end of the day are ripped out.  This is so the notebook eventually runs out of blank pages prompting a review as you write the new capture section in a fresh notebook. It is a built in review mechanism.<br><br>The capture section could be for reference info, like notes, but since the notebook is ultimately used up and noted filed, you may want to keep checklists somewhere else so you are not rewriting them when the notebook runs out.<br><br>Thanks for your interest and let me know if something is still unclear. <br><br>Gerry</div>

Of course, if you phrase the task that way, it is finished with one swing of the hammer! So you can enter the next smashing task at the end of the list. :-)</div>

<div class="content">Phrasing tasks in a way in which they can be done in one go isn't against the little and often principle. <br><br>For instance "Write report for Project X" is a big task and will take some considerable time.<br><br>"Open file for Project X Report" is a small task which can be done in one go. It is then followed by "Write main headings for Project X Report".</div>

<div class="content">hi everyone, <br><br>triple task is working very well for me, it's very flexible and easy to stay focussed. <br><br>The things I maybe do a little differently to gerry are <br><br>1. I have 'update inbox and waiting' as a regular task to deal with (say 4 out of 7 days) batched items. I probably have 15-20 of these items per session and I don't need to record them individually in the capture section, except to jot down telephone numbers. This tasks covers approx 80% of my job role and home admin and so is very effective. I learnt this technique essentially from DIT and it's fantastic for averting urgent fire fighting. I probably spend 2-4 hours on this task per session.<br><br>2. Write my 3 tasks in the capture section and ring fence them by drawing a box around them. Flipping back and forth does not suit me. I use a moleskin so I really would hate to rip the pages out! Besides, I like keeping a permanent record of my daily achievements. <br><br>3. I use the AF method of marking an X in the top page corner to indicate there is no information that needs to be converted into a task do on the page. I circle the X if this is so on the previous pages.  <br><br>I find it helpful explaining here what I'm doing -  to consolodate my approach. I'm also very excited about this system and hope it will serve me well in the longer term. <br><br>Thanks to all to on the forum for the recent burst of creativity!</div>

<div class="content">A few questions about Triple Task alone and also in using it with new Super Focus (these are both great names, by the way!)<br><br>First, can't you basically use the Triple Task concept with ANY of the methods? Simply cull the three tasks to "right now" list. <br><br>Second, if I understand Super Focus, the point of the second column is meant to be the "right now" area, similar to Triple Task--is that right? I ask because, I do recall reading on the forum how THREE seemed to be the magic number for Triple Task to work well. Yet Super Focus allows any number of tasks in the second column. Maybe I'm understanding something wrong... Any thoughts?</div>

<div class="content">DS:<br><br>Yes, you can in principle use 3-T with any other system acting as a feeder of tasks to it. Or you can use it on its own.<br><br>As for SuperFocus, the right hand column is not intended to be a 3-T column. It is an extension to the page, so that you can add additional tasks to an already full page or re-enter unfinished tasks so you can do some more work on them before moving on to the next page.<br><br>When you are working a page in SuperFocus, all the tasks on the page are available to be worked on - whichever column they are in.</div>

<div class="content">Today, I demonstrated the value of SF to myself. I begin a short road trip in a few hours and had to make preparations for it (my "prep-list").

<div class="content">DS,<br><br>While I think TT can be used with any system, I personally feel it is best to keep it real simple.  If you use it in combination with another system you may get too many rules for your liking.  I think what makes TT great is its set of rules for processing the three tasks.  I try to keep the focus on the TT rules and just use a capture section so I have everything when I go looking to fill the TT section.

<div class="content">Task size varies greatly for me.  I pick the TT tasks by importance and urgency.  For me the TT page is the really the top three things that need to get done to move my work forward.  I have found if the three most important things are getting done, things move forward and business is usually successful.  <br><br>The tasks could be negotiate a contract, return a phone call, read a contract, write a report, review a proposal, clear emails etc.  So it could be three calls in a row or three different tasks.  But all pretty standard stuff in most business organizations.<br><br>Gerry</div>
