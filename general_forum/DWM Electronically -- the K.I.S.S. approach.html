<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-02-16 23:28</div>
<div class="content">Hi all,<br><br>I've been using DWM very successfully for about 12 days now, and absolutely love it.  My implementation is 100% electronic, but I seem to be doing it differently from the others running DWM electronically, so I thought I'd post here and see if this helps anyone (or if anyone can suggest ways I could be doing it better).<br><br>It sounds to me as if everyone using DWM in an electronic form is making use of "date due" entries for each task, and somehow grouping the tasks by date.  This seems like overkill to me -- I tried this, and found it too complicated for my taste.  So I came up with a much simpler approach.  In fact, I deliberately used a free but very simplistic To-Do list application for the iPhone (it's called SimpleList Free -- ad supported but I never even notice the ads even though I'm using it constantly) so that I wouldn't get distracted by any bells and whistles.  Basically, this approach can be used in *any* to-do list program that allows you to have more than one list.<br><br>What I've done is setup a bunch of To-Do lists, where I use the date as the name for the list.  So, for example, my current lists look like this (it's the 17th of February today in New Zealand):<br><br>    2010-02-17<br>    2010-02-18<br>    ...<br>    2010-02-23<br>    2010-02-24 REPEAT<br>    2010-02-25<br>    ...<br>    2010-03-16<br>    2010-03-17 NEW<br><br>Each of these is a separate To-Do list, where (just like a calendar) each list contains the items entered for that day.<br><br>I spent about twenty minutes setting up all these lists at the start, and they've worked brilliantly for me.  If I click on a list, I can drill down to see the items for that day.  SimpleList has the advantage of showing how many unchecked items there are in each list, so I can see at a glance which pages have uncompleted items on them, and how many items I have on each date.  Also, the application's badge shows the total number of items across all pages, which is a helpful indication of how much my lists have grown.<br><br>Note that I used the "YYYY-MM-DD" coding scheme for dates.  That way, I can sort the lists alphabetically and they appear in the right order.  I also found it helpful to add "REPEAT" and "NEW" beside the "one week from today" and "one month from today" lists, so that I could quickly find the right list if I wanted to add or re-add an item.<br><br>Each morning, I add an extra list to the end, delete yesterday's list (no dismissed items yet -- hurray!), and rename the "NEW" and "REPEAT" lists.  This takes me maybe 30 seconds, and sets me up nicely for the day.  I also review my lists at the same time, to see what I need to focus on for the day.<br><br>Frankly, Mark's new system is absolutely fantastic.  I had mixed success with AF...it would work for a while, but the lists would grow stale after a while.  With DWM and its "conveyor belt of doom" (as I like to call it), there's no chance of the lists growing stale.  I've been incredibly productive ever since I started using it, and can't ever see myself looking back.<br><br>Anyway, I just wanted to suggest a simpler way of running DWM in an electronic form.  You don't need to be fancy (in fact, I bought OmniFocus to see if I could/should use it instead of SimpleList, but it seems to make things too complex).  I like the simplicity of my multi-list approach, and I suspect others may find it useful too.<br><br>There are two things I'd love to see that I can't do with SimpleList.  Firstly, it'd be great to be able to flick back and forth between the lists, a la FocusPad.  And I'd like the ability to "flag" some items and then show a separate list of just the flagged items (I'd use this for identifying all the items to do while running errands -- I found myself writing a separate list on paper when I had to go into town).<br><br>If I could use FocusPad or OmniFocus or whatever to do these two things, I'd be in hog heaven.  But even with the simple system I've got, I'm more than happy -- the K.I.S.S. approach lets me focus on the process of running DWM, rather than getting bogged down in the implementation.<br><br>Cheers,<br><br> - Erik.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Erik. I'm with you. I use onenote on windows in much the same way. <br><br>I enter dates manually and just put tasks after each date. One difference though: I put 7 days' tasks on each page so there's less flipping.  I also like to collect todos on one page like you do.<br><br>So far haven't seen anything compelling on the iPhone.</div>

<div class="content">I'm using excel with just 4 columns (today, new/continue, today+7 or +28, and the task). Excel calculates both dates for me. I sort once in a while by the expire date, just to keep tasks together. (I added a formatting formula to highlight tasks that expire today, and the +7 and +28 dates, but I may take that out.)<br><br>It's the first electronic "to-do" that I've keep with more than a couple of days.</div>

<div class="content">Erik,<br><br>I posted at length of how I iimplemented it it Toodledo.  You might check the website to see if it appeals to you at all.  You can also access it on the web through your iPhone with a specially designed layout.<br><br>It might be too complicated for you but it DOES have what you asked about:<br><br>- A way to switch quickly<br>- A way to sort on flagged items or prioritized items<br>- It also has a trivial way to move items to next week (a next week "button")<br><br>It seems overly complex but you CAN use only those features you want or need.  I find it works well enough.</div>

<div class="content">If you are on a mac, try TaskPaper. You can look at one list at a time or look at all your lists at once. And you can tag your items and sort by tags, such as "errands," "priority," or anything else that is useful. Seems like it does everything you are looking to do.</div>

<div class="content"><< It sounds to me as if everyone using DWM in an electronic form is making use of "date due" entries for each task, and somehow grouping the tasks by date. This seems like overkill to me -- I tried this, and found it too **complicated** for my taste. >><br><br>I believe the key question to ask is **complicated** for whom/what?<br>Is it complicated for the user to use?<br>Or is it complicated for the electronic form/list/program to automate?<br><br>I'm doing DWM electronically using AndreasH's brilliant AutofocusAHK (for Windows only though).<br><br>AFAHK is very easy to use for DWM. Basically only the following three steps ...<br>(1) You add new tasks by pressing Capslock-A and enter task description. AFAHK will choose the correct date to put it in. You can add more tasks at any time.<br>(2) You start working your DWM list by pressing Capslock-D Do Work. AFAHK will automatically present the next task for you to decide to start or skip to next task. <br>(3) After starting and stopping work on a task, you can re-add the task, and AFAHK will automatically choose the correct date to put it in. AFAHK will then present the next task for you.<br><br>Internally AFAHK is complicated with 4 different dates/times for each task. It tracks when you add the task, when it expires, when you do it, how long you do it. Those info is beautifully exported into an HTML page. You don't need to learn the complexities, AndreasH have done (and is doing it) for us, who DWM in front of a Windows PC most of the day. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Ah, iPhone, Mac etc, I sometimes get envious as a Windows Mobile user, I cannot see myself changing in the near to medium future WTMB.<br><br>Sabre32: you're right about the complication issue. and I reckon that hasn't change since AF1 came to pass.  In the end each of us must make our own decision in paper or electronic use.  <br><br>I already had ListPro on my notebook and WM device (synchronised), so it seems appropriate for me to use it as it is an easy application to set up and use (I also keep my default and specific assignment.travel checklists in ListPro).<br><br>For my own incarnation of DWM (see my rambling comments elsewhere), I am able to and do use it in paper mode during the day after I've printed the updated list in the morning.<br><br>I just love the forward focus of DWM with its conveyor belt of dates, it's actually increased my motivation since I've transferred my backlogs into the future as it were.  It's still got to be done, but I'm more up for the challenges of GED and DIT.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Erik:<br><br>As someone who’s very recently posted about implementing DWM in a variety of apps using a due date system, and given what the second ‘S’ stands for in ‘K.I.S.S.’, it would be possible to take offence. Instead, I’ll just point out that the ‘K.I.S.’ part seems misdirected. Implementing the core of DWM in The Hit List is *much* simpler than the system you describe. Set up takes less than a minute (and so a lot less than 20 minutes): start a new list (your DWM list), set it to display due dates only, and set it to sort by due date – that’s it. Assigning dates to tasks is then extremely simple, too: after entering the name of the task in the usual way, hit tab once (to be in the “Due” column for that task), and type either ‘1m’ or ‘1w’ as appropriate. Hit return and you’re done. THL translates those bits of shorthand into dates, and automatically sorts tasks by date, given the set-up. What’s more, everything’s now on one list, so no moving between lists all the time. (And you can archive any completed tasks with a single keystroke to keep the length of the list down. If you want to see the tasks you’ve archived, back in their original locations, that’s easy, too – there’s a keyboard shortcut – as is hiding them again.)<br><br>Other pros and cons are another matter, and this is a desktop app rather than an iPhone app, but if simplicity is the crucial issue....</div>

<div class="content">I agree it does sound easy.  A side-effect of this approach is to have one list instead of many.  That's probably okay too.  All the AF versions essentially had a continuous list with a divisions.  Erik's "simple" method though is to keep the divisions.  Which makes it a direct translation of the paper system, and that's not a bad approach either.</div>

<div class="content">I too use outlook for DWM. You can choose to group the tasks by due date, or not. Grouping and ungrouping can be done in one click. It is really fast to switch from one-list-large-general-view to focused-day-per-day-view.<br>I also use the priority field to shortlist important and urgent stuff when I am feeling overwhelmed. It helps knowing that you won't miss anything really vital. This shortlisting is done on a daily basis, to highlight today's priorities. NOT a permanent importance hierarchisation. <br>I also use the priority field for current initiative.</div>

<div class="content">Hi guys,<br><br>Thanks for the various replies.  It's interesting to read that what people think of as "simple" varies -- which is obvious when you think about it.  I've aimed for a direct translation of the DWM concept into electronic form, and couldn't stand the idea of having to enter a due date for each and every task.  But each to his own.<br><br>Tony: it's fantastic to hear that you'll be updating FocusPad to support DWM.  I can't wait...<br><br>Martin: my sincere apologies if my choice of the acronym "K.I.S.S." offended you or anyone else.  I've been using that acronym for years (usually directed at myself), and never even think what that second "s" stands for any more.  It was certainly not meant to be derogatory in any way!  I like what you've done with The Hit List -- entering "1m" or "1w" is certainly a quick and easy way to choose which list to use.  I must admit, though, that I'm not too keen on having everything in a single list, as that seems to break the "closed list" nature of the DWM pages.<br><br>Anyway, my real intention for making this posting was to share what seemed to be an overlooked way of implementing DWM electronically -- not to put down any other approach.  As I said above, each to his own.  And best to luck to everyone who is implementing DWM, be it on paper or electronically, date-based or list-based, or whatever other approach works best. Hopefully we can all share our approaches and thoughts, and learn from each other -- and most of all from Mark, who created all this in the first place.<br><br>Cheers,<br><br> - Erik.</div>
