<div class="content">I had to laugh at the way this ground-breaking new system is explained. Many of us here use (or have used, or will use, or are considering using) something similar, but she describes her variation well. She's on my short list if I ever need an "Interaction Designer".<br><br><a href="http://www.bulletjournal.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.bulletjournal.com</a></div>

<div class="content">Very interesting.  You're right, I have been using something very similar recently.   <br><br>It spawned out of my attempts to revive Superfocus.  I have been postponing posting its description as I thought it wouldn't be interesting.<br><br>However, the ad hoc 'system' that I have been using is fully digital. But does away with complexity. (Love hate relationship carrying around a notebook).<br><br>I will post it anyways later today when I have a bit of time. It might be interesting after all.</div>

<div class="content">Unfortunately, this is so similar, that its going to seem as if I'm attempting to hash bits and pieces of the above system. Anyways, I think its different enough and great for those who like analog systems , but in reality found it tedious to fit in their life. Yet easier to manage than the complex digital systems out today.</div>

<div class="content">Hello Cricket,<br>Thanks for posting this!  Interesting system and really well presented!  I've been playing around with a "free-form notebook" myself recently, so I may try out some of these ideas.</div>

<div class="content">Cricket, thanks a lot. Just a remark: I cannot help myself, but I hear the irony in "I had to laugh at the way this ground-breaking new system". I must defend its author a little bit - As bullet journal has been quite often linked from many productivity webs in previous months,  I looked at it several times and I liked the approach. <br><br>Its author never calls it ground-breaking system. It is simple, common-sense way how to handle tasks. And why not? My idea was: yes, and why not, why should task management systems be considered complicated "inventions", counter-intuitive, wow producing approaches? It is not rocket science. TM system is "just" a way how to write down tasks, choose them, do them. OK, everybody needs different approach, but when something is common sense, it may (by definition) mean that it is what majority (can) use.<br><br>And I have to confess that I am returning more and more to "common sense" approaches when planning my tasks. Anyway, thanks for sharing it here. It is inspirational.</div>

<div class="content">You're right, she doesn't claim it's "ground-breaking". I was amused to see such a professional presentation of a low-tech system, that doesn't try to sell us anything. You're also right that a system doesn't have to be high-tech to work. I've experimented with several, and always come back to a single low-tech notebook for my daily work. Simple, reliable, and can handle any type of note at any time.</div>

<div class="content">This is an exceptionally good system. It can be as complex or as simple as you would like. His video presentation is one of the best I've ever seen--clear and concise.<br>If you don't want to set up your Bullet Journal from scratch, you can use the Leuchtturm1917 (I ordered mine from Amazon) or the At-A-Glance Planning Notebook 80-6205 by Mead (available at Office Depot and other retailers). They both have the Index already in place. The Leuchtturm1917 has light grid dots and numbered pages and is the size of the large Moleskine. The At-A-Glance Planning Notebook has 31 numbered lines per page and is approximately 9" x 11".<br>I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 and I love it for a lot of things, but nothing beats picking up a notebook and just seeing it all right there on paper.</div>

<div class="content">Yes, Bullet Journal is a lovely system. There are lots of them and this is one of the nicest.<br><br>But you end up bogged down in a (long) list of tasks, just like most of the other systems out there.<br><br>So how do you decide what to do now, and next?

<div class="content">I love the concept and the way the Bullet Journal is presented. It's undoubtedly a fine effort in combining note taking with tasks, something I have wrestled with for a long time...A concern for me though is having potentially seemingly unlimited tasks buried amongst potentially many pages. Also, the provision made for a calander is not satisfactory (as noted above).<br><br>I feel it might overwhelm me personally. Let's face it, it also looks like a prime time opportunity for endless tweaking (no sarcasm intended), however it would be good to hear some feedback. In all honesty I have not trialled this method so am not speaking from any hands on experience.</div>

<div class="content">For years, I would draw a little checkbox in the margin of my notebook, to indicate the presence of a task.   Worked great!   <br><br>Now I just keep one (maybe two) sheets of paper in my pocket, and assume everything is an implicit task.<br><br>If something MUST get done, I draw a couple of big circles around it.<br><br>I don't like having more than one sheet of paper, so if it gets to be more than that, I bang through the oldest sheet and complete or delegate or delete everything.<br><br>At least that's what I mostly do.  <br><br>But all this is for the incidental stuff that comes up during the day.   I try to spend as much time as possible on my "current initiative".</div>

<div class="content">It is an interesting site and yes it is like many others systems. I also am a fan of writing in one place.  Like this and the circle idea at one point I used RAW. Results actions and waiting.  You used an R for a new result ie goal, an A for an action you had to take and a W for an item you were waiting for from someone else.  <br><br>The truth is for the last six months I have not been using any system and recently realized it is not a good thing. I have way too many pads of paper of varying sizes on my desk and in my briefcase.  Enough things have slipped through the cracks that I am going to go back to writing in one place.  The problem I used to battle was that I like to be able to remove notes from my notebook and being left handed I don't like spiral notebooks and legal pads get messy.  <br><br>I am going to try a simple composition notebook and add an index so I can retrieve notes if I need them. <br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">I tried this system out for a bit when this thread was started last year, but I found I couldn't make it work at all. I just ended up with a huge list of tasks with a lot of non-tasks mixed in. This didn't seem to be any more helpful than the systems I was already using, so I abandoned it. <br><br>Maybe it just didn't fit my style. It sounds as if a lot of people do find it useful.</div>

<div class="content">Many years ago (about 1990 to  2003) I used  a system very similar to that bullet journal.<br>It was feasible as long as I wasn't  assign too many tasks at work. In 2003 I ended up with several spreads of tasks per day. I found I my bullet-journal-type system to be too confusing, esp. the indexing. Got overwhelmed and started using GTD in 2003 (which I gave up in 2009).<br><br>If you don't add many tasks into your journal (like in the video), I think  this bullet Journal will work.</div>

<div class="content">My system varies, but one of the early warning signs that I'm about to drop too many balls is when I start using loose paper rather than my Everything Books. (I have two. One for my purse, one for my desk.) (Either I feel overwhelmed and don't want to look at the Everything Book, or I'm over-confident. Either way, a warning sign.)<br><br>(Much as I love EverNote for archiving, pen and paper are still more reassuring for note-taking.)<br><br>Loose paper or a separate book works fine if I know I'll always have it when needed. Notes from my voice lessons live in a book in my lesson bag. Programming notes live in a file by my computer. However, if the right place isn't handy, the Everything Book works fine.<br><br>If the page looks like a schedule or todo list, then that's what it is. Each line is an action item. No need for special marks. Cross out when done. Dot on the left during triage.<br><br>Otherwise, action items get a circle on the left, and items I want to archive get a box drawn around them. Stroke through page when I can tear it out (once the other side is done). Tear corner when no action items but an item to archive might be lurking. (Yeah, dual system for archive. Box means I thought of it then. Corner is the final pass.)<br><br>I still struggle with "do at meeting" vs "do at home". Theoretically, a square box means do at the meeting, either as part of the formal meeting or during refreshments, but in the moment I often put a circle. I tried circle on one side for "at meeting" and the other for "at home", but kept putting them on the left.<br><br>Check through circle means done. (If no circle, line through text.)<br><br>"msg" and the date means I left a message, but item still open. Arrow through the circle means item copied to other list. (I don't cross it out, since crossing out feels like done.)<br><br>And my circles aren't very neat. About half an inch diameter.<br><br>++++<br><br>For indexing, haven't tried it, but looks useful:<br><br><a href="http://blog.highfivehq.com/posts/a-little-known-hack-from-japan-to-get-your-notebook-organized" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://blog.highfivehq.com/posts/a-little-known-hack-from-japan-to-get-your-notebook-organized</a><br><br>The front (or back) page is the index, one topic per line. Mark the edge of on that line on each page with the topic, so when you close the book you see the mark. Easier to see than describe.</div>

<div class="content">I, like Mark have also tried the bullet journal, but abandoned it.  I actually bought, and am still using the dotted Leuchtturm1917, which I love as a notebook.  <br><br>I tried to work the system as described, but found that I was a slave to it.  Whenever I have a list of things I want to get done within a time frame like a day, or a week, or a month, then I usually don't end up finishing the list, and I feel like a failure.  So far, I am finding good success with simple scanning.  I have found over the years that I need a system that has low overhead to upkeep, captures everything, makes everything reviewable, and allows for maximum flexibility.  Still trying to figure out a couple of nuances, but so far, SS has proved way more useful for me than the bullet journal.  <br><br>I also think that the bullet journal can definitely work for many other people.  Just go to the internet and look at the many people that are successfully using it as evidence.  Why, I saw my niece-in-law setting up a bullet journal the other day.  She's 20, so I wanted to congratulate her on being wise enough at such a young age to carry a central repository of her tasks.</div>

<div class="content">Emma, Yes, you can add a random page in the middle of the week in a Bullet Journal. The system is very flexible in what you record. The only things in that system that are not flexible are using it often, and experimenting as needed to find what works for you. There's lots of advice on the main site to solve common problems (threading, review, indexing, planning ahead). Many of the other sites are more about art than the actual system, but it's neat to see what other people consider worth planing and/or recording, and how they do it.<br><br>Cameron, If you don't finish the list for the day, then you're planning too much. That's setting yourself up for failure. I found time recording very useful. Some things took longer than I expected, so now I allow more time for them. Some things took less time, so now I resist them less. I wasn't giving myself credit for many of my accomplishments. Also, it showed me which distractions were safe(ish) (short, rejuvenating) and which led to wasted hours. If SS is working, and you're preparing well for future events, great! (I found I kept putting off things like buy present. Mon: Lots of time left. Tues: Still lots of time. Wed: Big meeting (prep, travel, stress, exhaustion -- all predictable if I bothered to think about it). Thurs: Unexpected emergency. Fri: Ooops.)</div>
