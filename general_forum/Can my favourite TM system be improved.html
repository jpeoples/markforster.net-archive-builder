<div class="content">As you know my favourite TM system is AF1, but even I have to admit that it suffers from a number of shortcomings:<br><br>1) It lacks the focus on finishing that something like the 3-Task system brings.<br><br>2) It can't deal with urgent things well.<br><br>3) The list tends to grow and grow.<br><br>I've mentioned in other threads that I've tried the 3-Task system with AF1 and haven't liked it.<br><br>I think I have now found a very simple way of solving all the above problems without changing the essential character of AF1.<br><br>I need to try it out for a few days, but I am very hopeful.<br><br>Details soon.</div>

<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>Oooooohhhhh....<br><br>If you can do that Mark, that'll be great ^__^ I still have a soft spot for AF1 and its effectiveness in handling large backlogs.<br><br>God bless on your efforts.</div>

<div class="content">I am waiting also impatiently for this, as AF1 was my best and favorite system ever (and I tried almost everything Covey>GTD>AF1>2>3>4>DWM).<br><br>So am  gonna spent these few days on relearning AF1 rules.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>I am really looking forward to hearing about this.  I have been using the 3-task system and must say it has a remarkable effect on one's focus and ability to get things done!<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">If you keep posting such tantalizing things, Mark, you're going to tempt me to ditch DWM and go back to AF1!  *thinks about how to implement AF1 in ToodleDo*</div>

<div class="content">I didn't have a great deal of time available to use the system yesterday, but today I've got nothing scheduled so I'll be able to give it a better trial. So far, so good!</div>

<div class="content">Mark, <br><br>Despite having tried all the other methods reasonably intensively, AF1 has been my favourite method too. I got so much done with a feeling of effortlessness using it. It's only that "dealing-with-urgent-tasks" problem that has always been my major stumbling block, like with many others here I presume.<br><br>If you've found an effective way around that issue then it's time to uncork the virtual champagne!<br><br>My eyes will be firmly glued to this website for the revelation to come :-)</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>I was surprised to hear it was a modification to AF1, as I have been finding the power of Triple Task for me has been in the Triple Task section due to its focus and simplicity and not the adjunct list.  I found that as long as I had a capture list with everything on it so I had the peace of mind nothing was "lost", I could focus on the Triple Task list and was highly productive.   I do look forward to hearing about the potential modifications to AF1 to see how it compares to what I am using now.<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">Gerry:<br><br>This is not based on 3-T, but an attempt to see if I can bring to AF1 the sort of concentration that 3-T produces. So far it's working well.</div>

<div class="content">Mark - One thing I love about DWM is how it helps me gauge my total workload.  Does your new idea address this issue?<br><br>DWM stops the AF list's tendency to grow and grow, and your new system deals with that too, so I am guessing it WILL help with gauging / controlling the total workload.<br><br>Thanks Mark!</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br>It's still a bit early to say how it will work out because any system based on AF1 takes a while to mature.<br><br>However I have been amazed so far at how much control this system is giving me. One of the best things about it is that you can let it work virtually automatically or you can take minute-by-minute control (or anything in between). It is extremely flexible in a way which none of the other systems are.</div>

<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>Whoa, even more flexibility and control than DWM2, Mark? THIS I gotta see! ^___^<br><br>Yeesh, you're such a tease, Mark!<br><br>God bless you and your efforts!</div>
