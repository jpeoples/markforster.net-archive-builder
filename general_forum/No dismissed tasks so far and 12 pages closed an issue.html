<div class="content"><br>So far, I'm page 17. The pages 1-12 are closed (I mean all items done), with no dismissed tasks.<br><br>Does anyone find himself in the same situation?<br>Am I just an happy guy? Or is there some potential hidden issue in there?<br><br>To everyone who participates to this AF forum: I found and find a lot of very good ideas and incentives to help me in using correctly AF.<br>Thanks to all.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Pascal<br><br>I personally haven't dismissed any items either.  I had a few tasks which I thought would be dismissed but when it came to it I realsised that I had actually done them but in a different form.  I guess the level of dismissed items will vary from person to person and we will each find our level as we go along.  I'm sure if we did as Mark did and tested our own AF list by flinging a whole load of unread books or similar into it then we would see an increase .........</div>

<div class="content">I too have several pages complete with no dismissals.  I almost dismissed a few, but then realized I was just procrastinating on them.  I spent about 5 minutes on them, scratched them off, and recopied them to the end of the list.  For me, dismissing something really means I probably don't need to do them at all, and so far, I haven't put anything on my list on which I didn't need to make some kind of progress (however small).</div>
