<div class="content">A Different Random Method<br><br>I ran into some procrastination while using the 5:2 method when I would resist the first item in the list. This helped me.<br><br>Supplies:<br>Paper, Pen, as many six-sided dice as you like (I prefer the sets of 12 or 36 from Chessex for reasons that may become clear), a clear receptacle for dice (a glass or the Chessex box). I strongly prefer physical objects (paper, pen, physical dice) for this method.<br><br>Method:<br>1. Write down five tasks that do not require a specific sequence to complete. If a task requires a specific sequence to complete, write down the next steps - e.g. "Laundry - washer (dryer/fold)". I feed this list using a larger list, but you might find success with a no-list method.<br>2. Roll all of your dice and place them in a line.<br>3. For each die, work as long as you like on the task:<br><br>1 - First Task<br>2 - Second Task<br>3 - Third Task<br>4 - Fourth Task<br>5 - Fifth Task<br>6 - Player's choice<br><br>4. If the task is incomplete, cross it out and re-enter it at the end of your list of five items. For multi-step items, you would re-enter the task with the current step - e.g. "Laundry - washer (dryer/fold)" would become "Laundry - dryer (fold)"<br>5. If the task is complete, cross it out.<br>6. In any case, drop the die into your receptacle.<br><br>Considerations:<br>As you work the list, you may find that a die has rolled a number higher than the number of tasks remaining on the list. In this case, add new tasks to the list until you once again have five, then proceed normally.<br><br>If you roll a six, always fill up the list back to five and then select which task you would like to do.<br><br>If you are feeling resistance to a given task, use the 'just get the folder out' method.<br><br>When you have completed all of the dice, you are done! You may need to reroll a new set or move on to some other method, depending on how many dice you rolled.<br><br>Areas of Interest/Potential Discussion<br>1. This kind of list is neither an open list nor a closed list. It acts more like a WIP (Work In-Progress) queue from a Kanban. You might call it a 'fixed' list (or semi-fixed list) since the number of items is (mostly) fixed at five.<br>2. Dropping the dice into the receptacle is very satisfying. It reminds me of the paperclip trick of moving a paperclip from one jar to another. (e.g. https://primeyourpump.com/2019/07/09/paper-clip-strategy/)<br>3. I haven't run the math on it, but I suspect that this will give a more focused experience than taking a long-list and running a randomizer on the whole thing.<br>4. You technically don't need to cross out and re-enter tasks that are incomplete, but that's another area that feels satisfying, so I haven't removed it.</div>

<div class="content">Oh, this looks like a fun one! Might give it a try (with virtual dice).<br><br>So if there's a cross-out and re-enter (task actioned but incomplete), do the task numbers also change (shift by 1)?</div>

<div class="content">Virix -<br><br>Yes, the task numbers do shift around. You just count each un-actioned line (not struck through) to determine the current task. In practice it's very fast, and I haven't found that tasks lag behind too long before they are actioned.<br><br>In the worst case, you could always use a roll of a 6 to catch up a lagging task back to the current part of the list. <br><br><br>Good luck! I like virtual dice but there's something satisfying about dropping objects into a cup.</div>
