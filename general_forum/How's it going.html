<div class="content">Discussion has dried up lately. Following on David's poll of what you're using, I'd like to know if everything is working as you'd like it to.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Alan, across the Pond and in other parts of the world, a lot of folk are watching the World Cup Football (soccer), Wimbledon or going away on holiday, tis the holiday season.  Here in Damascus I just got back from a one week flying visit back home, warm and very dry here, Ramadan starts in August, the hottest time of the year.<br><br>I've been using my own hybrid which culls a Closed List from the main list.  I write this CL in a Moleskine pocket book, nice for focusing except I find I'm not writing down stuff in the main list; I'm writing in the pocketbook which is fine if it's a must-do or something extra (below-the-line), but have to stop myself writing other stuff in the small notebook if it isn't something I want to or need to do today (unless I don;t have my main list to hand)<br><br>I recall you have developed your own approach which I would have followed up, but I've been concentrating on project schedules and using kanban, early days.</div>

<div class="content">Hi,<br><br>I'm in a state of flux. I use insights from Mark all over the place: current initiatives, processing lists on Autofocus principles, listing work tasks on Do-It-Tomorrow principles ... But I've also used principles from Zen To Done, so I've now got a hybrid system.<br><br>I keep a calendar for scheduled items.  I block off a section of the day for work (I'm self-employed), and I keep a DIT list for work items. For other tasks I maintain a DWM-style list.<br><br>But I find a lengthy list so discouraging that I've radically shortened it by bringing the dismissal date forward to just one week from the entry date. Having things hanging around for a week is quite long enough if they don't get pushed forward. (I've accordingly renamed the list from DWM to OWM, for One Week Method.)<br><br>As a result, the number of items on the list remains in the 20s, which is quite enough for me.<br><br>I felt I had to introduce the Zen-to-Done Big Rocks principle to get a sense of priorities, so I began defining a number of the most important items to do for the week ahead - a few each in the areas of personal / family / work. Sure enough, after a promising first week, this crashed in flames. I really hate * anybody *, including me, telling me what to do!<br><br>But I still think I need the Big Rocks principle, so I'm reintroducing it on strict kaizen principles - "each step so small I can't fail to take it". So, defining a single Most Important Thing in each area for the coming day; redefining them as they get done; leaving greater ambitiousness for the future. The MITs appear at the top of my OWM list on my phone.<br><br>It'll be two or three weeks before I pronounce judgement on this particular recipe.<br><br>Chris</div>

<div class="content">Hi everyone,<br><br>I have been trying out a variety of systems, most recently being David Allen's GTD system, but I just cannot get on with it at all, I have to be honest I find the book really hard work.<br><br>I just got my copy of Mark's DIT out again so think I shall be reverting back to that...!</div>

<div class="content">Chris - I like your OWM idea. I found one month to be way too long and would a generate a list that I despised looking at. Curious how this works for you.</div>

<div class="content">Avrum,<br><br>Yes, I've been surprised that, when so many tweaks to DWM have been discussed, there's been no discussion (unless I've missed it) of twiddling the knobs on the day/week/month settings.<br><br>Chris</div>

<div class="content">About a month after DWM was introduced there was various discussion.  <br><br>I posted a thread on DWM minus the D, where dismissal is weekly instead of daily.  Somewhere there was debate whether 1 month or 28 days were best.  Others suggested in other threads that DWM might work well with only a week or two weeks were kept in the list.  Others had other opinions.</div>

<div class="content">I'm still doing pretty much straight-up DWM, and recently migrated to digital when I got an iPad (and yes, I did end up shelling out the five bucks or whatever it was for Toodledo, which I do love).<br><br>I'm about to have to do my first date-adjustment, having just come back from a week at my in-laws where I couldn't do a lot of the things on my list.  We'll see how that goes.</div>

<div class="content">Chris:<br>I found 28 days better, keeps the days of the week in sync as it were.  However, I'm intrigued by your earlier post on this thread about a one week outlook.  Does this not put pressure on everything if you capture everything and review /dismiss in one week's time, or am having yet another senior moment?<br><br>Sarah:<br>I'm trying to get a definitive answer from someone re iPad and touch screens.  I've used a PC tablet, but want something smaller and lighter.  Reviews mention "touch screen" etc, but that does not necessarily mean one can use handwriting.<br><br>I'm not focused on handwriting recognition, just want to jot down meeting notes, draw daigrams, paste in images, sound clips etc ie the things that PC tablets can do on OneNote and others.  If I could get a more compact tablet (smartphone etc too small), I would use it for AF/DWM all the time and hopefully get the best of both digital and pen worlds.  My current Toshiba tablet (12.1") spends 95% of the time in keyboard mode.<br><br>So the question is: can you hand write/draw with a digital pen on the iPad?</div>

<div class="content">Similar to Chris, I'm in a state of flux. The systems I've had most success with are DIT and the little tweak suggested by Jens in a previous thread: <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1131336" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1131336</a><br>which amalgamated DIT with AF in a very nice fashion . I also try to implement the 'Big Rocks' and MIT principles from ZTD with occasional success. Every system seems to break after a while and I start trying out a new one.<br><br>What I aspire to is to be like the guy on the next desk to me at work who, at the start of each week, writes down about 20 tasks on a blank sheet of A4 paper which represent his week's work, and then systematically works through them, crossing them off as he goes, adding new tasks to the bottom of the page. It's such a minimal system and yet, by the end of the week when I sneak a peep at the sheet, the tasks are nearly all crossed off! Can it be that simple, I ask myself?</div>

<div class="content">Linda,<br><br>I really do think it can be that simple.  He is capturing what needs to be done and in essence putting them into priority by either the fact they are on the list or in the list itself and then working to get them done.  At my office I see a variety of methods being used by my co-workers but quite simply the hard workers get lots done no matter the system they use.  I am not sure if it is a co-incidence or not, but the office supply cabinets at my office are filled with spiral notebooks and everyone uses them.  They are always in meeting and people carry them around.  So however they are employing the notebooks, people are using them effectively to get stuff done. As I wrote about one of the most powerful principles I believe is simply writing every thing in one place.  It allows you to always know where you need to find important notes, lists, or information.  No matter how you process the stuff in the notebook, it just seems to work to have it contained in one place.  At lease for me your mileage may vary.<br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div>

<div class="content">HI Mark and Gerry<br><br>Very true, I agree.<br>"the second most powerful principle is to chose one method and stick to it!" However, if you don't have confidence that the method is the right one for your needs, this leads to experimentation with different methods to see which one is the best fit. Sigh!<br><br>So perhaps the third most powerful principle is the need to have confidence in your system?</div>

<div class="content">Thre are various styluses that work with the iPad screen and several apps that will accept handwritten input. Download iTunes and have a browse through the iPad apps to see what's available. Two apps which cone to mind are "Penultimate" and "SoundPad", but there are others. I haven't use either, though. Google for "Pogo stylus iPad" to see an example of what's available on the stylus front. There are others.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Sarah, I guess I'm going to sit things out until another real tablet device comes along in the right size with the 'write' (groan!) capability.<br><br>Toshiba's new Libretto is a step in the right direction, but too pricey.</div>

"<br><br>If the second principle is to choose a method and stick with it, there will be little need for a third principle.<br><br>Feeling confident, feeling motivated, and the like, tend to FOLLOW action, not precede it. Use any of Mark's systems for 3 months. Then you'll have confidence in it. <br><br>Don't feel motivated to do anything today? Do something anyway. Nine times out of 10, the  feeling of motivation will be the effect of the action started. <br><br>Behavior trumps feeling. Do the behavior. The feeling will follow.</div>

Does this not put pressure on everything if you capture everything and review /dismiss in one week's time, or am having yet another senior moment?<br><br>Sorry, Roger, I'm not sure what you mean by "put pressure on everything". In theory everything should be the same as in standard DWM - all tasks get reviewed repeatedly until they're done or dismissed, any task can be dealt with at any time - it's just that they stay in existence a maximum of one week, rather than four. If you mean "induce a sense of panic" - well, I'm not a panicky sort of person (I'd get more done if I were). I find a shorter list a lot less daunting than a longer one.<br><br>So I'm sticking with the one-week principle. But once again, defining the Most Important Thing daily has got kicked into the long grass.<br><br>Chris</div>

<div class="content">> And the second most powerful principle is to chose one method and stick to it! <br><br>Well, yes and no, I think. While fussing around with new systems and tweaks is clearly a rather severe problem for a few people on these forums, and a significant one for lots of the rest of us, I also don't think there's anything wrong with repeatedly harnessing the sense of freshness and motivation that comes from introducing a new system from time to time. Perhaps the best Autofocus system is to cycle through versions 1 to 4 and back again. Not daily or hourly, of course, but every few months. <br><br>For me, the "second principle" would be: accept that you're never going to find a perfect system, and that any system you introduce will lose its appeal after a little while, and that there's nothing wrong with that...</div>

<div class="content"><And the second most powerful principle is to chose one method and stick to it!>  <br><br>I agree Mark<br><br>After developing four or five systems, I continue to come back to the most simple one I developed, the Steno notebook method.  I hesitate to even use the word develop because all it really entails is writing what needs to be done in one steno notebook and sticking to that one place so I always know where to look for what I need to do.  I do use groupings by project followed by a list of what I need to do or who I need to call.  I let my mind pick the priority as I cycle through the pages.  I try to tear out the completed pages and at the end of the notepad when there is no paper left, I use this as an opportunity to prune items from the list and start a new steno notebook, typically writing the projects as a page title and what needs to be done.<br><br>Writing in one place along with a simple a-z filing system have allowed me to be more productive than anything else I have tried.  I personally have never got along well with complexity and lots of rules in my time management endeavors.  At this point unless this system somehow fails, I will stick with it.<br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div>

<div class="content">Ludlow:<br><br><< Perhaps the best Autofocus system is to cycle through versions 1 to 4 and back again. >><br><br>The problem with changing systems is that each system is designed to put pressure on you to get the less attractive but important stuff done. But each system does that in a different way. So the result of changing systems is that you never get the more important stuff done.</div>

<div class="content">I'm still using a daily 'focus' list each day with up to 3 MITs (most important tasks), nowadays in a spiral bound notebook on the right hand pages. <br><br>The top of the left hand page is then used for an AF-like list of ongoing tasks that aren't day specific.<br><br>The bottom of the left hand page is used for grass catcher stuff, distractions etc.<br><br>Works quite well as I can focus on the daily list then when mostly done flip the book over for the ongoing/grass catcher items for the day. Or flick back through the left hand pages to see them for the previous days.<br><br>So, everything in on place! :)<br><br>That said I also use a reporters notebook purely for scribblings, random thoughts, shopping lists and rough notes.</div>
