<div class="content">Having tons of backlog, I guess I need a list of current initiatives arranged in the order in which I am going to deal with them.<br><br>How detailed should this list be ? Just a few lines regarding the fields of work I am behind of, maybe including the names of a few projects, or should it be as detailed as possible with sub-projects, work packages, and actions?<br><br>What would be better: a short list giving the big picture of my backlog or a long detailed list? And should the list of current initiatives be a closed list like the will-do list?<br><br>Rainer<br><br></div>

<div class="content">I'm sure Mark will weigh in here, but my preference is for a one-line description of the CI and not get too detailed too early. A too-detailed pre-plan would increase my resistance to starting the project. I'd say not to think about it too much, esp if you're just creating a list. And then, since they're all important (otherwise, why write them down), then tackle the most urgent first.<br><br>I'd say that you only need a little bit of planning to get started. Getting started is the key. The rest of the project tends to work itself out as you progress into the future.<br><br>It's rather like E.L. Doctorow's description of writing a novel as driving at night. You can only see as far ahead as the car's headlights, but you get to your destination in the end.</div>
