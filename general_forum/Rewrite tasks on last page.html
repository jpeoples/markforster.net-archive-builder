<div class="content">Hello everybody,<br>I'm using the AF since beginning of the week and find a lot of invaluable help in this forum. Now, I'd like to hear how you are handling tasks on the last page (which means the page that you are using for new entries) that you worked on and want to re-enter in the system. Do you cross them off your list an enter them on the same page again?<br>Right now I don't cross them off, because it seems weird to write the same taks down again on the same page. On the other hand not crossing sth off and moving on doesn't give you a feeling of having accomplished anything.<br>Descantes</div>

<div class="content">Naw, I think it is dumb to cross them off and write them down a few lines later.  I mean, I'd feel like I had OCD or something ;-)</div>

<div class="content">I must be sad because I like crossing it out and adding it further down........<br>It's only happened twice though.</div>

<div class="content">Mark's advice is to always cross off the item and readd it - even if on the last page.  You have after all actioned the task - you have done one of the 34 (or whatever) items on that page and should give the recognition for that.<br><br>There have been other posts on the subject but Mark's comment from near the start of Beta Testing is as follows:<br><br>"One can frequently action an item several times on the same page. For instance if I am on the last page - as I am at the moment - when I've finished the item "Comments" which is what I am doing at the moment, I will re-enter it on the same page (there are still five empty lines to go). I will then be going back to the beginning of the page to do another pass,and will come back again to "Comments" after working on other items.<br><br>Eventually I will fill the remaining four lines with other tasks, and the next time I re-enter "Comments" will be on the next page. So I have one more page to keep re-entering "Comments" on.<br><br>For what happens when I finally get to the end and have to start again from page 1, have a read of the blog post I have just made about speed of movement." <br>January 7, 2009 at 0:42 | Mark Forster <br></div>

<div class="content">I have a different last-page question. Let's say the last page number is 10. It has one item on it. I just finished an item on page 9. I decide not to work on any more items on page 9 right now. I turn to page 10. Do you either work or dismiss the sole item on page 10?<br><br>I don't. If I don't feel the item on page 10 stands out, I cycle back to my earliest active page. <br><br>My reasoning is that dismissal should apply to items that have been viewed repeatedly. Page 10, with only 1 item, doesn't work like pages that are filled with items.<br><br>How do others treat this situation?</div>

<div class="content">Moises:<br><br>Para 7 of the Quick Start section of the instructions reads:<br><br>"If you go to a page and no item stands out for you on your first pass through it, then all the outstanding items on that page are dismissed without re-entering them. (N.B. This does not apply to the final page, on which you are still writing items). Use a highlighter to mark dismissed items."<br><br>Please note the N.B. in brackets!</div>
