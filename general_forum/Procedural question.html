<div class="content">A not-so-hypothetical question:<br><br>Today is February 5th.  <br> I have 15 short stories that I must read  by February 15th. <br><br>I enter "READ STORIES" in my calendar for March 5 (the  30 day mark).<br><br>Then I start working -- maybe for 30 minutes.  When I'm done -- I re-enter "READ STORIES" in my calendar for February 12 -- the 7 day mark. And I work for another 30 minutes.<br><br>THEN WHAT DO I DO? <br><br>Do I cross out "Read Stories" from the 7 day list and Re-enter it on the 7 day list.  and repeat?<br><br>AND  should I have crossed  off "Read Stories" from the 30 day list by this point? Or do I leave it there because it's still undone.  (In which case, while cycling through my lists, I would come upon "READ STORIES" on both the 7 -day list and the 30 -day list).<br><br>Any guidance on this would be appreciated!</div>

<div class="content">Lilian, are you going to use paper for only home tasks, or are you moving to paper, period? I am finding my implementation of DWM on Excel to be working very well. <br><br>And I keep my file on dropbox so I can access it at work and home.</div>

<div class="content">Okay -- thank you. This helps a lot. <br> I have one more question now.  <br>Let's say it's tomorrow and I still have many stories left to read.<br>So tomorrow (February 6), I look at my list for February 12 and see "Read Stories" -- and I get to work.  <br>Twenty minutes pass. When I'm done -- i cross out the task.  But I'm still not done with the task. <br>Do I then re-enter "Read Stories" on a new list dated February 13th? (i.e. one week from tomorrow)?</div>

<div class="content">VegHeadJones - I'm sticking with excel at work but trying paper at home.  I'm working on the computer all the time so it makes sense to have the list on the compter too (oddly enough, DWM is the first 'to-do list' that I've felt comfortable USING on the computer). At home, once I get on the computer, it's such a HUGE timesink that my to-do's don't get to-done :)  <br><br>I've always had two lists so that's nothing new, the only thing I need to 'coordinate' is tasks that I think of at home that can be done at work or vice versa. I may start emailing them to myself (different email addys) and add them just to one e list so I don't have them on both lists or have a 'can do at either place' list.<br><br>I'm not sure if 'paper' at home will end up staying on paper or my Palm Tungsten. I'm starting with paper and see how it goes.</div>

<div class="content">Steve - <br><br>I've had the same kind of tasks, and I just re-write them (with or without an updated description depending on the task) on today+7 - so Feb 12.</div>

<div class="content">Steve,<br><br>Mark never said that DWM was the answer to every problem. As others have said, it can sometimes be beneficial to supplement a task management system, which DWM is, with a project management system.<br><br>If I anticipated that it was going to be hard to achieve the goal of reading all those short stories, I might, outside of DWM, create some kind of tracking system. Maybe I'd count up how many pages total I have to read. Then each time I read, I would know how many pages are left to read. Or, each time I finished a short story, I'd keep a running total of how many remain to be read..</div>

<div class="content">I have lists of project tasks outside of the DWM system.  Any I choose to work on I add to DWM.  Or just name the project in DWM.  It really is as simple as that.</div>

<div class="content">Moises and Alan,<br>Thanks -- that's very helpful. <br>  I find that with certain projects I prefer to have a clear set goal -- almost a challenge - which I then try to meet (i.e. I will read 10 of these stories by the end of the weekend).   That sort of goal-oriented behavior is often a real spur to action -and it seems to be antithetical to more intuitive productivity systems like AF1-4, etc.   Maybe the old DIT is more appropriate to tasks like these.  I wonder what other people think about a Goal-Oriented approach to tasks?</div>

<div class="content">Goal-Oriented work is the primary reason I migrated from AF4 to DWM.  I wanted to focus on certain goals, and AF4 encouraged me to focus on other things by cycling the Closed list when my goal was in the open list.  DWM meanwhile puts my goals on day 7, and urges me to take action there.</div>

<div class="content">But if my goal is to read 10 stories by Monday, and today is Friday,  I can easily imagine how --with the 7 day window of DWM -- this goal could become attenuated.  <br>And if my goal is to read 3 stories by the end of the day today, I don't see how DWM could help me (whereas DIT could).</div>

<div class="content">Steve:<br><br><< I can easily imagine how --with the 7 day window of DWM -- this goal could become attenuated. >><br><br>On the contrary, my experience and that of some others is that there is a strong psychological pressure to have as many clear days as possible during the 7-day window. For instance I have zero tasks remaining on Feb 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th, and only one remaining on Feb 10th.<br><br><< And if my goal is to read 3 stories by the end of the day today, I don't see how DWM could help me >><br><br>Well, I've been answering comments on this forum more times than that each day, and I've done it by sticking to the rules of DWM.</div>
