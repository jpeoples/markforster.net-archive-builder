<div class="content">Andreas asked if I had any of Mark's old newsletters, which sent me to my Gmail. <br><br>I was able to find about two dozen, from the very beginning in 2006 -- just about at the time he started the web site -- to the final one in 2016. <br><br>I'm sure I must be missing some early ones, but note that Mark released the newsletter sporadically through the years.  <br><br>You will likely not see much new material here, as much of it was repurposed as articles or blog posts, or vice versa. But -- I do find it fun to see Mark's promotions for his time management seminars, the ongoing conversation he seems to be carrying on with his readers, and the various announcements leading up to Autofocus.<br><br>I copied the content of the newsletters into a Google Doc with minimal reformatting, ie, none. The Google Doc is in a Pageless format. <br><br>I've shared the document so that anyone who has the link can view the document. Let me know if the settings are wonky or if I should turn this file over to someone else for further processing.<br><br>https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KTEcesu4cH7lFK32yuawA26cJ7PGdphgu8dsmYqscVM/edit?usp=sharing</div>

<div class="content">Thank you very much Mike, that are many more than I had collected so far. They might not add too much compared to the blog and forum, but I'd like to preserve as much of Mark's work as possible.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for this. <br><br>There is probably some overlap of content with The Pathway to Awesomeness. <br>I am assuming that everything in the newsletters were also in the blog posts - is that right? or is there some content which does not show up there? <br><br>Just skimming through these, it is clear that Autofocus and the Final Version were intended as a catch-all list. <br>I would still like to be clear on which long lists were intended as a catch-all list, and which not. <br><br>I see that the intuitive unconscious mind and rational mind are also connected to the Final Version, as well as Autofocus. Also that Autofocus and FV are similar in being catch-all long lists.  Also "structured procrastination" with FV.</div>
