<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-01-31 15:15</div>
<div class="content">I have been struggling with a backlog at work combined with major home improvements and paper piles everywhere (not to mention dust and disarray - no washine machine, cooker or sink for a week) I was growing more anxious and depressed about my growing AF list. With little discretionary time I was getting more and more overwhelmed about what I should be focusing on.<br><br>Yesterday I got back my copy of DIT which I had loaned to a colleague at work months ago! I decided to give it a quick re-read last night to remind myself of how DIT was different to AF. I realised that I really liked the idea of the task diary, especially to schedule tasks to a specific date in the future if they cannot be actioned right now. I also like the certainty of writing out each day my tasks for tomorrow, which provides the structure I seem to need to get going each day.  <br><br>But I also love the way that I can throw anything into Autofocus, large or small; quick notes to self that would otherwise be forgotten till too late, or missed altogether. <br><br>Anyway, having an unexpected day to myself, I have been tackling tasks in both methods. I have crossed off tasks from AF if they were best actioned (or could only be done) at a future date and written them in my task diary (an unused paper calendar) I had knocking around.... At the same time, I have been working on tasks that need to be done today (on an urgent/same day basis). I've also taken all routine tasks out of AF and scheduled them, as I found they were just were not getting done under AF. <br><br>My AF list is heavily reduced as is my anxiety level. Psychologically, I feel better knowing that my tasks are spread out over a couple of weeks, and that I don't have to decide or intuit whether 'doing the laundry' is standing out for me today. So now I can't work out whether to stick with DIT, Aotufocus or try and work some combined version of the two!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Linda,<br><br>AF is working pretty well for me, although I also have a lot of backlogs in papers and at at home, I empathise.<br><br>See my post on Autofocus and ListPro to see how I have set my hybrid.<br><br>My next step when I get back from assignment abroad next week is to use AF to fliter out the MUST DO stuff and others I should do,  and create a Closed List.  It will be interesting to see how this will work out, others have mentioned it in this forum.  I reckon applying the "little and often" as advocated for many AF tasks will work with DIT's Closed  List.<br><br>My ListPro components allows sub-tasks which can be added to a DIT as required, which is just as well because my backlogs can't be done in a couple of days.<br><br>As Mark F says in his original instructions, we have to apply commom sense and do the urgent/important stuff (not always the same thing!).</div>

<div class="content">Hi Linda<br><br>Sounds like you've been having a tough week!  Having started AF with some sizeable backlogs I have struggled with the deadlines caused by my prior procrastination and that feeling of anxiety that they generate.  I had to fight to trust the system on occasion but know that meeting those deadlines, whilst still labour intensive, has been accompanied by considerably less stress and with a lot more focus.  I really believe that we will not see the full benefits of AF until we have been able to get our legacy backlogs finally cleared, and think that during that period we may well have to use the other tools at our disposal on more than one occasion!<br><br>The way I have dealt with the need for a more specific approach in some areas, is to AF that approach.  For example, although I am dealing with things on a common sense basis, and perhaps using a DIT style method to action that, I am still including those tasks on my AF list, together with options to review my methodology.<br><br>A lot of my backlog tasks are set up under my project system and therefore effectively managed outside AF although tasked from within AF.  My project set up includes a lot more structure and includes elements from DIT as well as other sources.  What I am finding though, is that my project system is changing almost without my realising.  Some elements are becoming more structured and some are becoming freer - or more AF like, for want of a better description.  All of that seems to be happening naturally without my having made a conscious decision to tighten up some areas or loosen off on others.<br><br>I have not been able to spend much time on my lists at all this week, but have continued to review them.  Curiously my Page 1, had two tasks left - one has been completed this week and the other progressed so can be crossed off - as soon as I get back to my lists I know I will have my first non-active page!  Wheeeeeeee!<br><br>Hope you have a better week Linda and hang on in there ............</div>

<div class="content">Hi Roger J and Christine B<br><br>Thanks for your words of encouragement. I've read quite alot on the forum and have found the comments very helpful . I think the problems a lot of people have been having are due to backlogs and anyone throwing themself fully into AF, as I did, may well find they need to use a more structured approach at first. <br><br>I certainly don't want to abandon AF. One of the real benefits is the speed of entry - such as suddenly remembering something and being able to jot it down straight away (unlike the more ponderous PDA entry I have been using). The security is in knowing you will get to it sooner or later is extremely reassuring and has already helped me in a number of ways already.<br><br>The power of the electronic calendar though is in being able to schedule recurring tasks once on the calendar, and then forget about them till the due day/time. That's one feature I'm loath to change, though many people have said that putting them in AF works for them.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Linda<br><br>There's no reason why you can't continue with whatever form of scheduling works for you.  I have a task "check schedule" and if there are recurring tasks due anytime soon I will just add them into my AF lists.  For example I have some tasks due which cannot be actioned before about April.  I just made an AF task to add them to my schedule, which I will do at some point.  Then when I check my April schedule nearer the time I will add them as tasks into my list.  the "peripherals" to AF, whether they be the way we manage our schedules, or project management systems, will I am sure vary from person to person, but they can all be absorbed within AF by simple generic tasks such as "check schedule".<br><br>The great thing is that I don't have to remember to add things into my schedule, or make time to find my schedule.  By using my AF with the task "to add to schedule", I choose when to get my schedule out to update it - and the task is recorded anyway so will not get forgotten.  If I needed to diarise something but was not at my PC or have my diary on me then that entry could well get forgotten.<br><br>Hope that helps .....</div>

<div class="content">Hi Linda,<br><br>Using a calendar for your appointments and recurring tasks is not abandoning AF.  If tasks have a requirement to be done at a certain time, you should NOT use AF for them.  Think about what AF does to determine where to use it ... it automatically selects the task you most want to do at this moment and presents it to you.  If something has any requirement about it, then it must be outside of AF.  Of course, you could put that kind of task both in AF and on the calendar in the hope that you will see it in AF and do it sooner, I suppose.</div>

<div class="content">Linda:<br><br>I note that you said in your first post above that you have little discretionary time. The fact is that no task management system is going to work if you have no discretionary time to do the tasks. DIT requires discretionary time just like AF does.<br><br>I would advise you to see if you can increase the amount of discretionary time you have by looking carefully at the non-discretionary work you have. Is it all really necessary?<br><br>It would also be a good idea to see if you really need as many tasks requiring discretionary time.<br><br>However you manage it, you have got to match the tasks needing discretionary time with the discretionary time you have available. If you don't, you will always have backlogs regardless of what system you use.</div>

<div class="content">Linda and Mark.  Your last comment gets right to the heart of the problem, Mark.  Matching tasks to the discretionary time available.  You talked about this at length in your first book and I think that many of us are still struggling with this.  I know that I am.  As I've mentioned in previous posts, I've cut right back on "non-essential" regular projects, but the trouble is that these are sometimes the most enjoyable things on my list.  I took a machete to activities that were taking up a lot of time - including gardening.  Well, today I finally rebelled and went out into the garden just for 5 minutes or so.  I've missed it so much.  I'm thinking I will take up gardening again but maybe limit the time I spend on it.  There is no way to fit in all the things that I want to do.  Of course I could just put gardening on my AF list.  <br><br>Regarding my AF notebook - I had reached the point where I was leaving my notebook in a drawer and just remembering the things that I had to do.  Today though I decided to start adding tasks to the relevant section on my Palm.  I've always got my Palm with me- much easier for me than lugging around a notebook.  I feel happier with my Palm.  I had thought that jotting items in a notebook would be simpler than using a PDA but maybe not.</div>

<div class="content">Sandy:<br><br>The AF system is not designed to enable people to do everything, but instead to do the things which are really important to them while filtering out the other things. So you could indeed have put gardening on your AF list and it would have been interesting to see what happened to it.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-02-1 18:02</div>
<div class="content">Thank you for that post Mark.  I love gardening because it's a great way to wind down,  I find, plus the exercise factor.  I spent 15 mins today in the garden and that has been enough.  If I do that at the weekends and also the evenings once days draw out, that might be enough to keep me happy.  <br>I won't bother with gardening on the AF list because it's not something I could possibly forget.  And if I do forget, then I haven't really wanted to do it in the first place! It's not something that will matter if I don't do it.<br>Looking at your post above, Mark, if the whole point of AF is "to do the things which are really important to them while filtering out the other things" then might it not be the case that we will never get to the things that don't feel important from our own point of view, but actually might be important in the larger scheme of things?  I'll have to think about that.<br>So basically AF might well end up as a list of projects that don't absolutely have to be done at a particular time or on a particular day.  I have kept a list like this on my PDA for a couple of years now.  Perhaps I've been AFing my life without knowing it.  In that case I can tell you that my two year experiment has shown that I have items that are almost two years old that I know I'm unlikely to deal with.  I haven't deleted them from my PDA just in case I can get to them at some time.<br>The point is that some of these items are actually important.  I can see that very clearly but I'm probably not going to bother until I'm forced to do them.  A few of these items relate to medical and dental advice that I would like to get.  I hope that it won't take a disaster to make me get this advice.  Under the "rules" of AF I guess that I would see that I'm not getting to these items and work out what I'm actually resisting.  I might then break down these tasks until I can make a move, even if it's only a tiny step.  <br>Thinking about it, I have started to mull these items over and to get myself healthier before visiting a medical practitioner.  I've mentioned before in this forum that once an item has been added to the list (or any list - even a list in your head) it seems to be the case that the mind chews it over and things start to happen even if outwardly it seems that you are doing nothing.<br>So, maybe some of these older tasks will resolve themselves even if I don't seem to be taking action.  Or is that just an excuse for doing nothing about them?<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Sandy, AF is not only a list of tasks one is likely to forget, but a complete list of things you'd like to and need to do. I have many hobby-related tasks on my AF list. I enjoy doing them so much, but I was putting them off pre-AF in lieu of more "important" things. Meanwhile my guilt and anxiety about not spending more time on my hobby grew. I use my IPhone for the same reason you've decided to use your PDA. Give AF a real try using it and see what you think. One tip for getting more gardening time in...break it up into several tasks and put them on different pages as you think of them. I wasn't getting enough laundry time in because I had "laundry" written once on my list. Now I have all the various tasks on the list and I am in shock that I have NO backlog of laundry!! <br><br>I have been testing a true DIT-AF hybrid for the past few days. I expect to be posting about it this week. You can decide if the combination works for you as it has beautifully for me.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Sandy<br><br>I would really recommend doing as Mel does and include hobby related tasks on the list.  I am starting to feel my time is being better balanced and the time I am spending, on even hobby items, feels more productive (enjoyable/creative) as I don't feel guilty for taking time away from the "ought to" items.<br><br>It is curious to see the effect that AF has on tasks - the tasks I have done in the order I have done them would not by any stretch of the imagination have been my logical choice.  However the impact of doing those things has either, identified that they had a hidden impact on my productivity or, alternatively, identified that I needed to adapt the way I was doing them or even scrap them.  If I had not put them on the list in the first place I would have missed those "revelations".</div>

<div class="content">My two cents: don't choose and use both, if you feel more comfortable (DIT for deadline activities, AF for without deadline activities, DIT to calculate all "workloads" and better weight your "daily" commitment, DIT+AF for "little and often").</div>

<div class="content">Hi Pascal<br>I concur with your strategy!  I plan and schedule the musts, and most want tos...and allow enough flex time to enjoy discretionary activities.  I like the balance of  doing both.<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="meta">2009-02-3 22:21</div>
<div class="content">My 2-cents on DIT vs AF: Basically I always thought that DIT was a great idea in principle, but totally impractical for managing the kind of work I have. Basically I disagreed with the main premise that 'one days incoming work must equal one days outgoing work' (or however it is stated). Yes, it must be true in the long-run, but as Keynes said: 'in the long run we're all dead' (of overwork!). Basically in my kind of job (and I don't think I'm a special case or anything) there is no reason why I wouldn't have 10 days worth of work land on my desk on one day, none at all on the next, and basically no discretionary time to do anything about it on day 3, etc. So although DIT could cope with this, it never felt like I was doing it 'properly', and I had a semi-permanent backlog.<br><br>AF seems to be about the best way to deal with such a widely varying workload. Yes, there is not the same sense of 'completion' at the end of the day, but then I never got that anyway with DIT. I do get a sense of completion when I finish the day knowing I've worked efficiently throughout. <br><br>How do I know when I've finished the day with AF? - I finish when I feel like it!</div>

<div class="content">I agree with what Ed C. says in his post.  There is something artificial about the sealed-up days of D.I.T. -- in truth, work always seems to spill out over such neat boundaries.  Autofocus allows me a sense of continuity and movement from one day to the next which I find quite appealing and energizing.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Ed<br><br>At last!  Someone else who experienced the 10 days work in one day followed by nothing the next.  I loved the concept of DIT (and still do) but like you could never package things into those neat little daily parcels.  I think the concept of the "sense of completion when I finish the day knowing I've worked efficiently throughout" with AF says it all!</div>

<div class="content">Mark's comment above -  'you have got to match the tasks needing discretionary time with the discretionary time you have available' got me thinking. It brought to mind what I used to do years ago when life was really hectic at times, working full-time with a young family. To stay sane at those times I would have this mantra - we need to eat and stay clean so the only things I HAVE to to is go to work, buy food, cook it and wash clothes, everything else is optional! <br><br>I'm now operating on a similar principle with my DIT/AF hybrid. I use a Palm PDA with the Datebk6 calendar. The calendar lists my committments - meetings, classes, appointments as well as day-specific tasks (identified from my AF list). <br><br>In the Tasks app, I have a checklist of the recurring daily and weekly maintenance-type tasks that keep life ticking over, such as cleaning, email, deal with post etc. (this is the same as DIT's daily will-do closed list ). Those three - calendar events, day-specific tasks and daily checklist are my basic minimum essentials and sit outside my AF system.<br><br>Now I feel I can use AF in a more planned way. My AF list holds everything else that comes along in life's random way. I can throw all tasks, projects, reminders at it. knowing that I will get to work on them when I have the time to do so. Thanks, Mark!</div>
