<div class="content">A newbie to Autofocus, I'm wondering if any AF veterans found The Power of Full Engagement compatible with Mark's work. <br><br>I'm particularly interested in those of you who did the exercises. <br><br>Thanks.</div>

<div class="content">I think the power of full engagement is one of the best books currently out there on the topic of personal productivity. I'm not sure Autofocus and that book have much in common methods wise though. My personal system does match quite well with the approaches in power of full engagement while allowing for a system like AF to run within it. I'm happy to email a summary of it if you're interested.</div>

<div class="content">Peter, I would be interested in reading a summary of your system if you would be willing to send it to me.</div>

<div class="content">I finished the book on Tuesday. The anecdotes and theory weren't earth shattering. However the productivity plan (worksheets) is excellent. My plan is to throw some habits into my AF system.</div>

<div class="content">For those interested (thanks) I've just loaded up the summary to my system. Just send a blank email to thecsystem+sneakpeek@ g o o glemail.com and you'll get an automatic 'canned response' detailing the system.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Steve, try again @googlemail.com with thecsystem+sneakpeek stuck in front of it (that includes the "+" sign). Others have already had success emailing, so it seems to be working ok.</div>

<div class="content">Peter, can you post it on here?  Not to be jerkish, but isn't the entire purpose of the forum to put up these types of materials instead of having threads of email addresses and whatnot?  Thanks, TK</div>
<h2>Reply by Steve</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-04-10 21:38</div>
<div class="content">I disagree with you, TK.   <br>If we feel like sharing systems we are working on -- a generous impulse, I think -- we can do so however we like.</div>
<h2>Reply by TK</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-04-11 2:44</div>
<div class="content">Steve, I agree it is generous, but I think there's also reason to think twice about sending out email information to any third party.  There's a reason there's no login at this site.  To me, anyone instructing me to send my email information with xy or z on the subject line sounds dangerously like spam potential to me.  I'd also like to point out that threads filled with email addresses are pretty useless to those checking in here for information, and further commentary on systems sent off the board by email is completely useless.</div>

<div class="content">I agree with TK, I thought the whole point of the forum was for sharing.<br><br>It feels like it's being offered to us then being taken away again, and I for one won't be handing out my e-mail address to every spammer in the world that's for sure.</div>

<div class="content">I'm with Steve on this issue of sharing methods.<br><br>I will be putting up something later which may only be of interest to some folk in the forum, and will use Dropbox public folder.</div>

<div class="meta">2010-04-11 10:51</div>
<div class="content">RogerJ:<br><br>If you share the dropbox folder here, aren't you technically with TK on this one? Or will you ask people to make their email addresses public here for everyone to grab and then send them the link to the folder?</div>

<div class="content">Just realized, upon reading the thread once more, that Peter didn't ask interested people to post their mail addresses, but posted his own for them to mail him privately. In this context I don't quite get the "threads of email addesses" and "spammers" issues raised by TK and Jack. Apologies to Peter. I still prefer public sharing though. :-)</div>

<div class="content"><< I don't quite get the "threads of email addesses" and "spammers" issues raised by TK and Jack >><br><br>No, neither do I. Especially as Jack says he isn't going to hand out his email address to every spammer in the world, but then puts his email address in his signature.</div>

<div class="content"><<Especially as Jack says he isn't going to hand out his email address to every spammer in the world, but then puts his email address in his signature.>><br><br>Well, I think only you as the site owner can see the mail address he enters here, so he probably doesn't consider you a spammer, but is more doubtful regarding Peter. I guess.</div>

<div class="content">Damn, and just as I was getting so much good information from your .... ummm ... two posts .... ummm ... criticizing the generosity of someone who offered info for free.  But yeah, you punish Mark by falling silent ... again, for ... what ... offering information for free and a venue to freely exchange ideas.  I don't know about you, but I'm just awash in SPAM from Mark.  I've got ONE email in my folders from him ... from a year ago ... a welcome email, if memory serves.  I just don't know how I'm going to survive all of that SPAM.  Damn, I knew I never should have given Mark my email address!</div>

<div class="content">Peter - thank you for the information - it is most informative and helpful and has given me much food for thought (especially as I have a couple of health challanges that I need to address). I can see why this is not appropriate for the board due to it's length.<br><br>Please don't let the comments here prevent you from continuing to share in whatever form you prefer. I for one am very appreciative.</div>

<div class="content"><< Well, I think only you as the site owner can see the mail address he enters here, so he probably doesn't consider you a spammer, but is more doubtful regarding Peter. I guess. >><br><br>Yes, you're quite right, Ben. It's sometimes quite difficult to work out what I can see and what others can't. Still entering one's email address is voluntary, and I would have thought that, for people who don't know the site well, I would be far more likely to spam people than Peter would.</div>

<div class="content">Hi all, I think I underestimated the power of curiosity! I made my initial post in response to Bruce partly because nobody had responded yet after two days and since I think the power of full engagement is an extremely valuable book I felt compelled to chime in. The book is not widely known, at least..., I rarely see people mention it. Because my personal approach lends itself really well to the power of full engagement I figured he might be interested.<br><br>I set up a google account to prevent spam (if anyone will get spam as a result it will be me), but I do agree that its nicer to have information shared. If there was private messaging I would have offered it that way because I didn't feel compelled to put it online at this time for various reasons. (Not that I'm vouching for a pm system.)<br><br>On a sidenote, for those that are apprehensive about sharing their emailaddress on the internet, if you have a gmail account, you can limit and track spam using the same method as I did by adding a + and some random text as an identifier to your email address. You can use the identifier as a filter and block future spam that way. <br><br>For those that thought they were getting a summary of the book 'the power of full engagement', sorry for the mishap, but this mindmap is insightful:<br><a href="http://bookvim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/the-power-of-full-engagement1.jpg" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://bookvim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/the-power-of-full-engagement1.jpg</a><br>as well as this amazon review:<br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G3CMLEQ2T57" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G3CMLEQ2T57</a><br>and I think the cliff notes here are more extensive:<br><a href="http://www.philosophersnotes.com/titles/the-power-of-full-engagement" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.philosophersnotes.com/titles/the-power-of-full-engagement</a><br><br>(I'm not affiliated with those sites btw)<br><br>Thanks for the interest everyone!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Peter: Just to add my own appreciation for sharing your work here. The system sounds extremely promising - like a mini guiding light for your intuition as you go through your AF list for the day. I really like it, because I know I can often fool my gut into doing what I shouldn't be doing. Only to realise it later and kick myself for it.</div>
