<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-02-26 5:00</div>
<div class="content">Since it's been a month (give or take a few days), I wanted to compare Mark's original DWM rules with how I'm actually doing DWM as a test status update / input / whatever. From all the discussions about tweaks over the last week or so, I lost track of what's 'original' vs 'tweaked'<br><br>Original (per Mark's blog post dated Feb 1) -<br>>1. You need a page-a-day diary with plenty of lines. Also some form of bookmarking for today’s date and the two entry pages (see below) - though turned down page corners are probably quite sufficient.<br><br>me - on paper (home list) I'm using a cahier notebook, 1 page per day, but I'm changing that to 2 pages/week because 1page/day is too much space. <br><br>> 2. All new tasks are entered on the page which is one calendar month from today’s date. Example: Today’s date is February 1st. New tasks are entered on the page for March 1st. Tomorrow I will enter new tasks on March 2nd and so on.<br><br>me - on paper, I do it Mark's way. on Excel (work list), I use a 28 day 'month' to avoid weekend dates (when I don't work) and because at work, "do this by next month" the 'next month' translates to "4 weeks from today" or 28 days. <br><br>This may be a tweak, or it may just be a changing the description from "one calendar month" to "one month from today" (in which case, both Mark's original description or using '4 weeks from today" are both correct 'month long' timeframes)<br><br>>3. All re-entered tasks are entered on the page which is one week from today. So any task I re-enter today (Monday February 1st) goes on the page for for next Monday (February 8th). Tomorrow (Tuesday) they will go on the page for next Tuesday 9th and so on.<br><br>me - yes.<br><br>>4. Nothing is ever entered on any page, other than the pages currently one month and one week from today’s date.<br><br>me - yes for dates between today and today+1 month<br><br>I am experimenting with using dates beyond today+1 month as a tickler - these pages are * not * part of the active list since they are beyond today +1 month. Definitely a tweak<br><br>>5. All active pages are treated as if they were one long list and you continue to circulate round them doing the tasks that stand out.<br><br>me - yes, although at work I tend to concentrate on the today+7 and today+28 dates because those have the freshest tasks. probably not a tweak though<br><br>>6. All tasks which are on pages earlier than today’s date have expired. <br><br>me - yes, although I expire the page at the end of the day, not at the beginning. Not sure if this is a tweak or just personal preference.<br><br>Renumbering/redating pages for missed days wasn't part of the original DWM post. I'm not planning to do the renumbering or re-dating though. For planned days off, I'll either 'block' those days ahead of time, or, if there's tasks on those days, clear them before I go. I've got a couple of plan/ideas for the unplanned days (a)  keep 2-3 days ahead of expire date (b) if pages do expire because of unplanned days, case-by-case basis -either save the pages for 1 or 2 days before expiring, or expire the page(s) but move the tasks <br><br>So overall I think I'm following DWM per Mark's original 6 steps with minor tweaks.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Lillian,<br><br>Quick feedback, prefaced by my initials.<br><br>>1. You need a page-a-day diary with plenty of lines.
