<div class="content">I dropped the D out of my system at work.  Observe on your calendar that if today is considered part of "Week 1", 7 days in the future is always on Week 2, 28 days out is always on Week 5.  I now have 5 pages.  Weeks 1, 3 and 4 are closed.  Weeks 2 and 5 are open.  I dismiss Week 1 each Sunday.<br><br>Effects I've noticed:<br>0) Tasks have a slightly longer window till expiry.<br>1) Much more evident closed list effect on this week.<br>2) I must budget to clear the week.  If I have 30 tasks This Week, I make an effort to clear 6 each day. (Not counting tasks on other pages.)<br>3) If I fall behind, I can generally use Saturday to catch up.  (Running a business; it happens.)<br>4) I'm still able to track 1 day's work.  That work record is found on next week's page.<br>5) Modest pressure all week, free-feeling weekends. <br>6) Less inclination to go back to a task until next week.  (This may be a negative.)</div>

<div class="content">Very interesting. We could call it the "Do It Next Week" system. :-)  I might try this method, with two facing pages per week.<br><br>How long have you been at it?</div>

<div class="content">A couple days, although I have had week-sized pages since the beginning.</div>

<div class="content">You meant dropping the T? From DIT to DIW?</div>

<div class="content">Instead of Day-Week-Month (DWM) I'm just dealing with weeks and months at work.</div>

<div class="content">Alan, do you mean that you enter new tasks on Week 5 and when you have worked on a task, you re-enter it on Week 2?</div>

<div class="content">> I'm still able to track 1 day's work. That work record is found on next week's page. < <br>I don't quite undertand this. To me, it looks like every (weekly) page would hold 1 week's work, wouldn't it? Or do you subdivide the weekly pages in some way?</div>

<div class="content">BTW: Nice observation that  today +28 ist on week 5, not week 4. When I was thinking about a similar system, I didn't notice that.</div>

<div class="content">Linda: yes, exactly as in DWM.<br><br>Alex: To have a record, at the start of a day, draw a line after the last task on Week 2.  Whenever you pick up a task to work on it, first rewrite that at the bottom of Week 2, then work.  In DWM, you may do exactly the same by writing on day 8.<br><br>Here's an interesting hack for DWM: Every day switch pen colors between blue and black.  You will easily be able to see which tasks are new and which are re-entered.</div>

<div class="content">Alan, thanks for the explanation. However, that's not exactly DIT I/O tracking, but I can see how it's useful for logging your work (if you write _everything_ down on w 2 - below the line - before you work on it, even if it's done in one act; to me this looks a little cumbersome, though). <br><br>Personally, I can't see weekly pages working in my job (the pages would have to be huge, esp. considering the re-entries). But I might use it for my personal tasks.</div>

<div class="content">Alan: I can't see why weeks 3 or 4 are closed list. When you will achieve the current week, on Monday morning (in France, weeks start on Monday), week 3 Will become week 2, in which new tasks arrive. Where did I miss your point?<br>Thanks beforehand for any light you could provide.</div>

<div class="meta">2010-02-28 18:55</div>
<div class="content">Exactly. Closed week 3 becomes the new open list week2.  This is just according to Mark's way of reckoning.  The only totally closed list is this week's.</div>

<div class="content">Okay, here are the instructions for the Week-Month (WM) system, or Do-It-Next-Week (DINW) system, if you prefer, liberally plagiarized from Mark's original blog posting (<a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2010/2/1/dit2-af5-who-cares-what-its-called-this-is-what-im-working-o.html)" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2010/2/1/dit2-af5-who-cares-what-its-called-this-is-what-im-working-o.html)</a> of his DWM instructions:<br><br>----------------------------------<br>1. You need a two-facing-pages-per-week ruled (or quad-ruled) notebook with plenty of lines (possibly divided into four, six, or eight columns), and enough pages to carry you through at least 5 weeks (a 104-page book for the the whole year is fine.) Also some form of bookmarking for the current week (W) and the two entry weeks (see below).<br><br>2. All new tasks are entered on the facing pages corresponding to W+4. Example: This week W is Week#9 of 2010 (Mon 01 Mar to Sun 07 Mar) . New tasks are entered on the pages corresponding to W+4 (Week#13). Next week (W=10) I will enter new tasks on W+4=14.<br><br>3. All re-entered tasks are entered on W+1. So any task I re-enter this week (W=9) goes on the facing pages for next week (Week#10).<br><br>4. Nothing is ever entered on any page, other than W+4 and W+1.<br><br>5. All active pages are treated as if they were one long list and you continue to circulate round them doing the tasks that stand out.<br><br>6. Each Sunday evening (or Monday morning), all tasks which are on pages corresponding to the previous week have expired. They are dead, done for, dismissed, deceased. Move your W, W+1, and W+4 markers and strike out the dead tasks.<br><br>The thinking behind this is that you can put anything you like into the system. If you do nothing about it, it will remain there for four weeks then expire. If at any time you commit yourself to a task by taking some action on it, you are put under increased pressure to get it finished by being given only one week to do some more work on it. Of course many tasks are done in one go, so can be deleted without being re-entered.<br><br>That’s all you need to get started. <br>--------------------------------------------<br><br>I'm currently using a Field Notes quad-ruled booklet with four columns of 28 lines per week (room for 112 tasks). I think it will work fine for me. Others may need more space. It's certainly nicer to flip through only five week-at-a-glance pairs of pages. And I like the idea of the 'line of doom' not hitting until the week is up. Finally, it's convenient not to have to keep moving the three page markers daily.<br><br>Thanks again for the inspiration, Alan!</div>
