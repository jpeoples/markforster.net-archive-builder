<div class="content">Hi,<br><br>I assume this has been asked before, but couldn't find any reference (I've been away from the forum for some time).<br><br>Let's say that I work on a task, then stop, and re-enter it on the next page's 2nd column.<br><br>I stop working on this page, move to next one, where's there's only one easy 1st column task. I work on it for a couple of minutes and finish it. Then I have to deal with the task I just re-entered, or else...<br><br>But... I just finished working on it, and don't want to, or can't work on it any further.<br><br>I just started trying SF3, and I'm constantly meeting this situation.<br>Did I misunderstand the rules?<br><br>Thanks!</div>

<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>Mark said somewhere (can't find it now though) that you have to be more careful in writing stuff in Column 2 (C2) than when in Column 1 (C1).  While in C1 you can be a bit more vague in defining your task ("Read Pride and Prejudice") when you maintain the same level of vagueness in C2 you'll have trouble (compare "Read Pride and Prejudice" vs. "Read Pride and Prejudice Chapter 1").  So when you have to re-write a task into C2, determine first what is the definition for "finished work for today" for that task, write that on C2, work on it and re-write on C2 of succeeding pages if necessary, then once the task is finished for today, re-write it in C1.<br><br>God bless.</div>

<div class="content">Nuntym - glad to see you back!   Did you take a break for awhile?<br><br>Walter - Mark has said if you PHYSICALLY CAN'T take action on a C2 item, then it's best to just move it foward to the next page.  Otherwise you should take some action on it before moving forward to the next page.  Them's the rules.<br><br>Personally, I've interpreted this to mean "MORALLY CAN'T" also -- for example, I am at work and really shouldn't spend any time working on my taxes, though I physically COULD.  :-)    I can't really squeeze in any useful activity at all on my taxes into a small, incidental break.   So I just move that one forward during working hours.   <br><br>If I were in your situation, I'd probably force myself to take some action -- mainly because that's what the rules say, I don't like making a habit of breaking them, and find that unexpected benefits frequently result from following them strictly.   For example, forcing yourself to act on that C2 item would also have the effect of causing you to cycle through C1 at least one more time, which is a key mechanic of the system that gives you more exposure to any remaining C1 tasks.   Maybe one of the "hard" tasks in C1 will seem "easy" on the second cycle.<br><br>But if you are more comfortable with "common sense overrides", go ahead and move it forward to the next page.  :-)</div>

<div class="content">I've found myself in this situation more than once - I move through the list pretty quickly  and often I find myself back to a just-re-entered C2 task in less than 15 minutes.  I just treat the C1 task(s) I did in between as a short break and get back to that ongoing task.  In these cases, I tend to work on that ongoing task in 10-minute spurts interspersed with "breaks" to do C1 tasks but it does get things done.<br><br>Another possibility is to think about how you're phrasing things when you put them in the list.  I have found that SF requires much more specificity - so rather than just writing down a project name I write down a very specific task related to the project... otherwise my C2 would be very, very overloaded.</div>

<div class="content">Walter,<br><br>This is what makes SF so effective: grit your teeth and do a few minutes work on the task.<br><br>But also, don't keep working on a task for long at a stretch, unless you really think you're going to finish it. You'll be back soon enough!</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for your answers.<br><br>As some of you suggested, I'm going to treat the task as a small project, with smaller steps that will go into C1, instead of reentering the whole thing in the next page's C2.<br><br>The BIG task (testing a program) can really wait, nothing will happen if I don't work on it for a couple of days. If my boss would be pressuring me, I'd go the C2 path.<br><br>But on the other hand... isn't this cheating? I'm avoiding the pressure to finish the whole testing thing...</div>

<div class="content">... now I understand why I'm having only two pages after two weeks using the system.<br>Column 2 is filled with reentered tasks, while column 1 grows very slowly.</div>

<div class="content">"can really wait, nothing will happen if I don't work on it for a couple of days."<br>There's other options.  Since you only have two pages, why not define the task as "Test Something".  Test one thing, done.  Recurring enter in column one.  You'll pick it up again whenever you're on the last page.  Or if you're on the last page you might even pick it up again several times.  Work on it a bit this morning.  Another bit this afternoon.  Another bit tomorrow.  Since you only have 2 pages, this shouldn't be hard to pull off.<br><br>Or you might do testing in batches.  Test 3 things, C2 it, later test 2 things. Done.  Reenter C1.  You'll do more testing later.  <br><br>I recommend having very few priority ongoing tasks.  Most should be in small batches.  The reason is you want to focus on the very few to get them done and out of the way.  Then you can focus on the next few.</div>

I usually only have one or two things that are moving from page to page in C2.  When one of them gets done, another larger task will stand out. When I get my SFv3 demo posted you'll see this in action.</div>
