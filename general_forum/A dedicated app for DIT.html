<div class="content">I'm a new indie Apple developer and I've created a dedicated DIT app, Domorrow, as my first product :)<br><br>Website: https://domorrow.undertex.com<br>Apple App Store (iOS/macOS/iPad): https://apps.apple.com/app/domorrow/id6554001109<br>DIT features:<br><br>1. Creating tasks on tomorrow's list by default<br>2. The Backlog list (as well as a Maybe list)<br>3. Recirculating a task (via long-tap/right-click menu or left swipe gesture)<br><br>Additional features:<br>4. Custom day ending time for night owls<br>5. Multiple spaces (total 3) to separate work tasks from personal tasks<br>6. Showing system calendar events together with tasks<br>7. Syncing via iCloud, no privacy risk<br><br>The app is free; the multi-space and calendar integration features require a subscription at $0.99 per month.<br><br>Hope it will be useful for DIT enthusiasts. Feedback is appreciated!<br><br>P.S. The credit to Mark/DIT is both in the app and on the website.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, will check this out!  There have a few DIT apps etc. over the years but they've fallen by the wayside, so nice to see a new one.</div>

<div class="content">Thank you for putting this app together. <br><br>Unfortunately, it is Apple-only, and on the iPhone/iPad requires iOS 17, which e.g. I don't have. My phone is stuck on iOS 15 and will not receive furher updates. I also have a PC, not a Mac.<br><br>It may not be nice, but therefore I'd like to point out an alternative: With Remember The Milk (RTM) and its smart lists, that can have quite sopisticated filters, you can put together a very good DIT system with 'today' and 'tomorrow' lists, and everything you enter will appear on tomorrow's list by default or on the corresponding date you want, and you can also direct it to today's list 'below the line'. The possibilities with the smart lists & filters are plentiful. The free version is sufficient. Unfortunately, the development of RTM has stalled.<br><br>I found DIT the perfect system when I was in a job situation where every task was a 'must-do' and 'ASAP' item. I'm not in such a situation now, but I'd instantly return to DIT if the need returned.</div>

<div class="content">I forgot to clearly point out that RTM is cross-platform.</div>

<div class="content">Yes, but barely. Maybe you should take a look in the RTM Subreddit. It would be a shame IMHO if they went down, because their advanced filters that can be put together completely manually are unique among to-do apps AFAIK.</div>
