<div class="content">After a while experimenting with AutoFocus, I'm arrived to a kind of solution, I'd like to introduce and get some remarks and/or suggestions from you all.<br><br>Firstly: I'm IS Project Director BUT I use paper a lot (I don't know why, but when writing a task on a paper sheet, I feel more 'commited' to do rather tahtn on an Excel or OutLook like solution. Same for MindMapping: I love the concept and I strongly prefer to do mindmap on on brown paper (witk stick'its) or on a whiteboard, rather than within a tool.<br>I guess what I need is something like an 'overview of everything', when thinking, and the PC screens are too small for that...<br>For the same reasons, I don't like when working on AF list to forget an 'day' event (appointment or just a 'todo this day'). Probably a kind of rest of culture about 'if you say you'll be there or do that for this slot, do it' (I'm quite commit oriented.)<br><br>Now, "my" solution: <br>1. I decided to use only one book. I really don't like to separate in different places what I'm supposed to do.<br>2. I decided therefore my "A day a page" calendar (13x20cm).<br>3. For each day: I divide vertically the page<br>	3.1 left if for appointments<br>	3.2 right is for AF (and I can have up to 29 tasks) and tasks to be done on this date only<br>4. when déciding what to do next:<br>	4.1 I look firstly on the agenda part of the day (I might have a meeting or a booked slot for a 'meeting with myself' on something specific for that day)<br>	4.2 if no 'appointment', then I use the AF section of the calendar, exactly the way described in AutoFocus pilot of our friend Mark. <br>	4.3 it means I have a mark for the current day (on my calendar, the right bottom corner is easily 'tearable', as there are little holes dedicated for that; I use the right top corner to go quickly to the last page with on open task (I mean not dismissed not done); I use a piece of paper to know where I am on AF list.<br>E.g.: today, my "not completed or dimissed' page of AF is on page of the day Tuesday 20th of January<br><br>Working that way, it is very rare I need to go to future dates (excepted for 'on that date' todos).<br>The fact I have something 'todo' on past pages (past dates) gives me a feeling of: guy, you need to do something there! (And then, I applied the 'little and often' principles'.<br><br>That's it. I works perfectly so far, it's very easy to handle.<br>Your comments and/or suggestions are very welcome!<br><br>Thanks.<br>Pascal<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Pascal,<br><br>My mind works a lot like yours.  I like paper because human vision is wider than any display that I can currently afford ;-)  I mind map a lot and do it by hand ... I agree with Tony Buzan that the eye hand coordination stimulates thinking and drawing symbols and pictures is a part of the process.  There is a place for computer mind maps, and I use those as well, but more often after I have finished the creative part and want to tidy things up to send elsewhere.<br><br>As to your AF system, it sounds well thought out and I can see where it would work.  But realize that there is an underlying assumption in that system: that the size of the AF list grows in a way that does not put it too far out of reach of your calendar.  IOW, the AF list could grow too large and you might run out of the range of the book after a time.  Also, at year end, you might end up hauling around that calendar for a while -- but that is true of any book, I suppose.<br><br>But otherwise, I love the creativity of that integration.  Nice.</div>

<div class="content">Pascal,<br><br>thanks for sharing your thoughts. This set up looks like a good way to protect your Af list against intruders like appointments and same-day urgencies.<br><br>Thought about this approach too, but was worried about what to do when there is no more space in the calendar for the AF list but the calendar part is not finished. Thus I opted  for keeping the diary/calendar separated from the Af list.<br><br>Good luck!<br></div>

<div class="content">One thing that has particularly struck me about AF is the fact that so many of us confirmed techies who feel totally lost in a power cut, are finding the paper aspect of AF to be the best solution.  I love your point Pascal about feeling more committed to a hand-written task than one typed on screen.  A strange fact but very true!<br><br>Mike I totally relate to your use of Mindmaps - I am exactly the same.  I use MindManager which is an excellent program but feel frustrated sometimes by the inflexibility of it's little boxes and my "best" digital mindmaps will always have a picture background rather than a white screen!<br><br>A bit off topic perhaps - sorry Pascal - but just a thought that struck ......</div>

<div class="content">@Rainer and Mike<br><br>My tasks takes in average 15 to 30 minutes. Therefore, a page is around a day effort (if I don't take into account appointments...). I do consider - in a DIT mode- I should not have more than one page of new todo per day.<br>Nevertheless, if necessary, I thought I can add a todo on the day after ((it never happen, just theory). Doing that way: if works as if I use another book, but with this 'DIT' advantage to see if my todolist is larger that necessary, in a way.<br><br>For year change: you're right, I might have to travel with two agendas at the same time for several days / weeks.<br><br><br></div>
