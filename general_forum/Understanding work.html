<div class="content">Last week I discovered myself slightly unbalanced by working a never-ending list.  To rectify that, I'm reviewing my home and work lists to grok what all the work is about.  <br><br>So far I have  marked all tasks:<br><br>+   important/priority<br>'    small<br>\    routine/low urgency<br><br>Seeing those marks really illuminates what's going on for me.  Each page has a mixture with some of each.  I can study this mix and decide if it reflects what I ought to be doing.  Next I'm clarifying the things I want to do from the things I feel I should do.  In the process, many tasks may get booted.<br><br>I also want to look through things to see what the purpose of each task.  I aim to identify goals I'm working towards.  Some stuff may be combined into projects.  I aim to clarify projects, and rephrase them as something I clearly want to do.<br><br>I hope this process will make my work more focused, purposeful, and less random-feeling.  I expect I'll only need to do it once.  After this, I can markup and review as I work.</div>

<div class="content">Alans,<br><br>Thanks for the new word.<br><br>To grok (pronounced /ˈɡrɒk/) is to share the same reality or line of thinking with another physical or conceptual entity. Author Robert A. Heinlein coined the term in his best-selling 1961 book Stranger in a Strange Land.  In Heinlein's view, grokking is the intermingling of intelligence that necessarily affects both the observer and the observed. From the novel:<br><br>    Grok means to understand so thoroughly that the observer becomes a part of the observed—to merge, blend, intermarry, lose identity in group experience. It means almost everything that we mean by religion, philosophy, and science—and it means as little to us (because of our Earthly assumptions) as color means to a blind man.<br><br>To your point, shouldn't you start with the goals first and then move to the tasks?  I too have tried to move away from the never ending list and have been experimenting with a daily list of six important items set the night before pulled from my project lists.  So, during the day I only work the six items until they are done, or a truly more important items which arises during the day trumps something on the list.  <br><br>This six item method is based upon the supposed story of Charles Schwab of Bethlehem steel and how he discovered this method.  It seems to work and cuts down on list reviews until such time as you are done with the six items.  It also seems to get me to complete more tasks whereas with AF, I could just work a bit, cross a task off and then re-write it at the end.<br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div>

<div class="content">Gerry, <br><br>How are urgent / unplanned tasks handled with the 6 item approach?</div>

<div class="content">I note them on the page below item # 6 and simply make a call as to whether or not a new item is more urgent and do it, or continue on the list of six items and do the new item after the six are done.  Obviously, the length of the list could be longer or shorter.<br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div>

<div class="content">Yes Gerry, <br><br>I suppose there is plenty of flexibilty there. I wondered if one of the six tasks could be reserved for batching urgent items together but there is probably no need. <br><br>Does this method require an 'inbox to zero' attitude though, as I could imagine my inboxes getting pretty unruley!<br><br>And I get you are talking about a project list a la GTD?</div>

<div class="meta">2010-09-17 18:59</div>
<div class="content">It is really just plan your day type of method, which goes against GTD and AF.  It is closer to DIT where you are attempting to decide in advance what you will accomplish that day.  I never worry about getting my inbox to zero, it has just never bothered me in my life stuff constantly flows in.<br><br>The tasks come from hand written sheets for each project, one per project.  They can also be in the same notebook if you like to do as I do, which is follow the rule of writing in one place.  I still take notes in the same notebook.  If the notes lead to an item making it to the daily list, I put is there, if it goes on a project list I put it there, if it is something I need to keep I file it, if not it is pulled out and tossed.<br><br>Most days, I have the notebook open to the daily page and try to blast through.<br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div>

<div class="content">Start with goals then move to tasks? That never worked for me. My goals would never line up with the things I actually needed to do!  I take here a bottom up approach of looking at my tasks and figuring out what goals these tasks might help me achieve.<br><br>Now I have real goals that i'm already working on. I study these to see if I wish to change some, add some, or emphasize some. Then I can review my tasks with the same perspective and change up my activities based on this higher view.</div>

<div class="content">Alan,<br><br>I don't understand your response, you say you can't start with goals and then you say you have goals and change your activities based on this higher view.<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">I looked at the things I am doing and asked myself what purpose each served. I figured out the commonality among these and derived generic goals.  For work it's things like make customers happy, find more customers. At home it's things like keep my house in order, socialize, personal development. <br><br>Admittedly these are very bland goals but these are real, what I'm actually working on. From here I can work to define more interesting goals and develop plans to meet those. Which doesn't mean I drop the goal of an orderly house. If I started topdown, that goal might not even show up and my life would be unbalanced.</div>

<div class="content">Looking at tasks to discover goals is a good addition. Sometimes starting with goals will omit something important or help you rephrase a goal.<br><br>There's nothing wrong with bland goals. A well-run home or office provides security and stability. A stable base camp is essential to any expedition. Sometimes focusing on them exclusively is useful. The danger is when we limit ourselves to those bland goals for the long run.</div>

<div class="content">I have to admit, one goal has done much to motivate me: Order. I like when things are in order. I think getting Near there would improve my life.  Identifying the goal makes a lot of tedious tasks interesting. More than that, it directs me in HOW I should approach the tasks.</div>

<div class="content">I agree with the "order" goal. Sometimes I picture myself in my ideal environment so I can concentrate enough to create it.</div>

<div class="content">May I suggest to treat each task as a 3 step thing.<br>You have: Prep, Doing and Clean-up.<br>If every time you have done something, you clean-up after, it becomes a habit and you don't even have to follow-up on that as a specific task later...<br><br>Obviously, clean-up is more then just the physical thing. It also means identifying what you have accomplished and what's next about that. You are still on the inertia of that things so it's more easy to do it now then when you pick it up again later...</div>

<div class="content">That's a very good idea, especially to maintain order once it's achieved. Also it fits Mark's strategy of a closed list: to get something in order, first stop adding to the disorder. As you say, clean up immediately after making the mess.</div>

<div class="content">> Last week I discovered myself slightly unbalanced by working a never-ending list.<br><br>I just happened to read an article on lifehacker.com which says that besides "putting stuff you want to do on the list" we should also ask ourself what the list isn't for. The article then identifies "refugees" which we should cut from our list.<br><br>"Clean Out Your To-Do List for Guilt-Free Productivity"<br><a href="http://lifehacker.com/5513709/clean-out-your-to+do-list-for-guilt+free-productivity" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://lifehacker.com/5513709/clean-out-your-to+do-list-for-guilt+free-productivity</a><br><br>Your To-Do List Is Not a Dumping Ground: You should not be using your to-do list as your brain storming/thought capturing zone<br><br>Your To-Do List is Not a Wish List: ...Park them in a "someday-maybe" list<br><br>Your To-Do List Is Not for Ambiguous Tasks <br><br>Your To-Do List Is Not for Motivation<br><br>Your To-Do List is Not a Task Graveyard</div>

<div class="content">I see where you are coming from Alan and I sort of feel the same myself.  My thoughts are moving towards a slightly different approach.<br><br>I see the organisation and smooth running of my house and 'office' (I work from home) as a habit thing rather than a time management thing. So this means I should develop good daily, weekly monthly habits (a bit like 'flylady') to keep these things running smoothly rather than putting endless tasks on a 'to-do' list which grows too large.<br><br>This is particularly useful for regular activties - for example change towels and wash once a week on a wednesday, change bed and wash them on a thursday and so on.  I have observed a few of my friends who seem to run a 'tight ship' i.e. they have their affairs in order, and it seems to be that they have these habits - however they also seem to know when to make changes to reflect changes in their life circumstances.<br><br>I've spend ages trying to put things like 'do my accounts paperwork' on a 'to-do' list (either AF or some other) only to end up igmoring it.  However if I have a habit that I spend a hour on a Monday and a Friday doing this task, then I'm much more likely to get some progress.<br><br>Is this the sort of thing you mean?  I'd be interested if others have noticed this and if they have 'habits and rituals' that they have introduced to make their home/office organisation more effective.</div>

<div class="content">What I've noticed, Alison, is that if I put this sort of task into AF a routine develops naturally.</div>

<div class="content">Arh, good point Mark.  I guess you get to the point that it becomes ingrained and you no longer need to enter it?</div>

<div class="content">Kneitinga: I'm quite sastisfied now with my tagging solution, and also interjecting mo<br>ents of pause to reflect on where things are at. As for the lifehacker article, that approach could work but I don't think it necessarily has value.<br><br>Putting those so-called refugees in the list has value too. Then it's no longer a todo list,  but as an AF list it works. You'll notice in the article many "forbidden" things get handled by an additional system with additional requirements for organizing.<br><br>Allison: I am starting to create routines. For now I have lists of things that should become daily habits and I have a calendar to write and rewrite weekly tasks. For the rest, I'll do as Mark suggests. It's on the list until it becomes habit.</div>

<div class="content">And even when it becomes one, it will probably stay on the list ;)</div>

<div class="content">Alison:<br><br><< Arh, good point Mark. I guess you get to the point that it becomes ingrained and you no longer need to enter it? >><br><br>Not quite. I'm a great believer in putting *everything* into AF. And what I find if I do that is that a natural rhythm develops as to the frequency and time at which I do the recurring tasks. <br><br>So to use one of your examples if I put "Change Towels" on the list it would settle down to being done once a week (or whatever was appropriate) without the need for a rigid schedule - which I'd be unlikely to keep to anyway.</div>
