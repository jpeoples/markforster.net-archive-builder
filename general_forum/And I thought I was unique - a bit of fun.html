<div class="content">1 or fewer - but that's not that surprising. ^^<br><br>I don't know a site like that for Germany, I guess that would be quite a different result. (On the list of the most common surnames in Germany, "Hofmann" is 23rd, if you write it as "Hoffmann" (as everyone does who meets me, sigh), it's even on place 11.)</div>
