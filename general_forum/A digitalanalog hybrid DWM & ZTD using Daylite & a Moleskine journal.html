<div class="content">How it works:<br><br>a. In the evening, I choose all "due tomorrow" tasks in Daylite and enter them into a personalized to-do sheet (loosely based on David Seah's forms). I also choose two tasks based on the following criteria: 1) Something that scares me 2) Something that is a game changer.<br><br>b. During the day, I use the right side of my Moleskine for sketches etc (a la Danny Gregory's The Creative License), and the left side of my journal for aforementioned to-dos, errands, notes, etc. <br><br>c. In the evening i update Daylite. <br><br>There are so many advantages to a hybrid system. Most importantly, the updating of my journal and Daylite provides a built-in daily review of tasks and projects. <br><br>DWW rules keep things fresh, and me honest.</div>

<div class="content">Fascinating though I'm not seeing DWM in this. The picture side I've never heard of before. What's it for?</div>

<div class="content">>> Fascinating though I'm not seeing DWM<br><br>All new tasks/projects are given a due date of "next month"<br>All re-entered tasks are given a due date of "next week" <br>Any tasks "due today" that are left undone are automatically dismissed. <br><br>>> The picture side I've never heard of before. What's it for? <br><br>In Danny Gregory's The Creative License, he encourages you to use a daily journal for sketches, to-do's notes, etc. By keeping it alll in one place,  you get a snapshot of your day. Inspired by this idea, I sketch/draw on the right side of my journal, and tape a form (loosely based on David Seah's Emergent Task Planner)  on the left side of the journal. <br><br>I don't cycle through the list. I use Leo Babauta's suggestion of working on 1-3 MAJOR tasks per day. I use the rest of the day to work on any "due today" items and other admin stuff. <br><br>Resources: <br><a href="http://dannygregory.com/2010/10/the-creative-license-giving-yourself-permission-to-be-the-artist-you-truly-are/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://dannygregory.com/2010/10/the-creative-license-giving-yourself-permission-to-be-the-artist-you-truly-are/</a> <br><a href="http://davidseah.com/2010/01/emergent-task-planner-free-version-updates/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://davidseah.com/2010/01/emergent-task-planner-free-version-updates/</a></div>

<div class="content">This is an intriguing idea, combining your artist's journal with your to do list, especially the drawing on the right, list on the left. I've been making my drawing journals using Circa type rings. I'll try punching my list and putting it in with my sketch paper. Is the DWW part how you choose what goes on the list the day before?</div>

<div class="content">>> Is the DWW part how you choose what goes on the list the day before?<br><br>Sorta. I try to populate my list with the following:<br><br>1 - game changing task<br>1 - fear based task<br>? - tasks that are due "today" <br><br>All the aforementioned tasks come from my DWM list.</div>
