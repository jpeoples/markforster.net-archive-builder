<div class="content">Yeah, DIT ruined me too...well, I guess a better word is "improved", because using it has really granted me the power I needed from a TM system.  If you want a bit more flexibility in your DIT, why not try combining it with SMEMA like I did, since you found SMEMA to be really helpful to you?  I detailed the rules in this post: <a href="../general_forum/Dynamic DIT (DIT + SMEMA).html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2110482</a></div>

<div class="content">I saw that post. Thanks for the second consideration. As you know, I loved SMEMA, but I've since realized that what I loved about it was the opportunity to do what I want after doing some things I want to do less. I've found that Pomodoros serve the same function for me with less hassle. I work for 50 minutes and then get a 10 minute break to do whatever I want to do (even if it's not something I've written down). But that's just how I seem to work best. Often I don't even need Pomodoros. I just get busy and rest when I'm worn out.</div>
