<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-02-1 4:35</div>
<div class="content">Someone here posted on GooToDo a while back. I created the free account, but didn't really "get it" until I started reading Mark Hurst's Bit Literacy. I have had these email folders on Gmail of Waiting On and some ToDos that I know I don't need to address until some time in the future. It didn't really make sense to me to put a calendar note to dig up an email in one of these folders. But I love that I can send the email itself to the appropriate date via GooToDo. I think there's a workaround for this with other TM software, but nothing as simple as this. One of his quotes that I really loved was something like: Technology doesn't exist to make people more productive; it exists to make them buy more technology. <br><br>Anyway, thanks for the tip! So far I really like it and the book, too.</div>

<div class="content">Right. He says paper doesn't work for the information age though. LOL<br><br>I am wondering if your new approach would work well with Gootodo. One aspect of it I really like is that you always feel like you're working ahead. I would have to work tasks that can only be done on that specific day as per typical Gootodo, however. I'll let you know if I try it and I'll report back.</div>

<div class="content">Mel:<br><br>Any update on your experience with Gootodo?  I coincidentally came across it, linked from another site, and immediately wondered if it would work for DWM.  <br><br>I am finding DWM quite cumbersome on paper- unlike AF, for which paper  always seemed ideal!<br><br>I have signed up for a trial account anyway.</div>

<div class="content">Hey acedia!<br><br>I am absolutely thrilled with gootodo. I've had a 100% empty inbox since using it. I've never gone that long with an empty inbox and even when I had one a la GTD, I had numerous files of email tasks like Waiting On and Project folders that I never looked at. I read Mark's book, Bit Literacy, and although not all of the material was relevant to me, the stuff that was made a huge impact on me. It is the easiest, quickest way I know of to assign dates to email tasks. It's so fast to redate items--even on my iPhone. And I love that it automatically moves undone tasks to the next day with no overdue notices attached. <br><br>I am not using DWM strictly, but I think you could easily use Gootodo for it. Either create an email with the subject being the task and email it to 1m@gootodo.com or go to the site (I keep a tab open with my list all the time) and click on the date one month from now and create a new task. Simple simple. <br><br>I'm using a grand mix of things right now that I'm very happy with. The first thing I do is look at my goo (love that - lol) and decide what I absolutely have to do today. The rest gets redated. One thing I have been trying in the spirit of DWM is when I have an article that I'm not that excited to read, I'll email it to 1m from now. For tasks that are more pressing, I send them to tomorrow in the spirit of DIT. Repeating tasks I do and redate. I do not put everything on my list. Only things that I get via email, things I'm likely to forget, or projects and tasks that have deadlines or someone waiting on them. When I read a blog post I want to do something with, I email it to goo. Before I had it starred forever in my Google reader. When I'm waiting on something, I forward it to the appropriate date. I find that I can get through everything most of the time and even have time to work ahead. If I find myself continuously redating some things, I don't feel guilty about it, because I will either a) have a sudden desire to get it done fast or b) decide not to do it. <br><br>I hope your trial with goo goes well. I compared using Toodledo and Google Tasks with goo and felt the latter was the best fit for me.</div>

<div class="content">Wanted to note that there are a couple of new options on GooToDo now: recurring tasks (though these have to be entered separately) and categories. I don't use categories, but I have enjoyed having the option of creating recurring tasks.</div>
