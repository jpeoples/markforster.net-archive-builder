<div class="content">Well, there has been a lot of discussion on personality types, but what about whether you are a visual person?<br><br>I must admit to a lot of procrastination around time management - especially at the moment.  I can really see the sense and logic of the AF system and there is a part of me that really likes the idea of having absolutely everything in one 'list'.<br><br>I really wanted to use DWM, but as I am a very visual person (who quite happily forgets in seconds flat anything that is not on view) I really struggle with the idea of potentially having tasks spread over 30 days. I'm just not sure if I would scan all those pages in a cyclical way to see everything in a timely manner.<br><br>I sort of see AF as better for this, becuase I probably wouldn't have anywhere near that many pages. I can also see how DIT can work for me as everything is in one place.  Having all these options have now given a lot of fuel for my procrastication and to be honest I just need to get on with things and do some real work!!!<br><br>Can anyone comment on this?  Are you very visual and does one method suit better than the other?</div>

<div class="content">Try making a mind map of your things.  Major nodes are major areas of your life with more discrete things branching out.  It works well for visual people.  With Mind manager you can also use color, flags, icons, dates, durations, links to Outlook, etc.</div>

<div class="content">Mike I have mind manager and use it to project planning, web site planning and so on.  I did try to use it for tasks, but it got a bit complicated.  I tend to use it for an overview of projects.<br><br>Are you suggesting using it instead of AF, DIT or DWM?</div>

<div class="content">Well, I don't see how it would be an advantage with any of the AF tools, but if it is visual you want, that is visual.  But since AF is all about intuitively selecting tasks to be done, then it is probably following the spirit of AF.  Rather than pages you have conceptual branches.  You could make branches pages but I don't see the value in that ... unless having them all in a map type layout seems useful.  I dunno.</div>

<div class="content">Alison, I am also a very visual person. I have been using Gootodo and one of the things I love about it is you see only today's stuff. You have to kind of "look" for stuff beyond today. I am easily overwhelmed by to-do's which is what got to me with the first 3 AF methods. I never tried AF4 or DWM.</div>

<div class="content">I like using MindManager for tasks because it shows relationships.  I have a bit of trouble with lists and they are WAY easier than block text for me to manage ;-)<br><br>Laying projects out in MM gives me a visual view of how things relate.  So I have something that is a cross between a concept map and a PERT chart.  IOW, as I move toward the edges of the map I get to the things I should be working on that will enable the ones closer to the center to be achieved.  (The center being Nirvana, of course ;-)<br><br>The "problem" with the MM approach is that it works better for projects and is less useful in handling the one-of things that clutter our lives.  Also, it does not have any kind of AutoFoucs attributes ... IOW, it orients toward Project and not Time or Level of Effort or simply how long stuff is hanging around not getting done.  What it adds to my life is that I can see those relationships easier and AF robs me of that dimension.<br><br>For example: on my AF list I have sprinkled various tasks about maintaining several home computers in various stages of disrepair.  But some tasks are common to some (or all) machines and some tasks depend on other, non computer related housework.  (I need to reorganize my office if I plan to put a computer system in there, for example.)  Laying it out in MM I can SEE that there is little point building my office system first because then I'd be off in reorganizing my office shelving and ... well, a whole lot of things I'm not willing to do first.  But I can also SEE that if I solve a problem with organizing my NAS and USB storage devices so they work over the network, I'll solve multiple problems on multiple computers with the least effort.<br><br>Another effect of using MM is that it provides some motivation because it shows how one thing may be affecting other things.  IOW if you want to do more exercise you need a place to do that so you might want to clear an area in the living room or some place.  And if you want to put in a new bookcase you might also want it in the living room.  Etc.  So you can see, visually, that reorganizing the living room is a bottleneck for several things you'd like to achieve.  So a simple line item in AF such as "Plan New Living Room Utilization" appears now as a bunch of arrows which SHOW exactly WHY you want to do it ... no words needed at all.<br><br>But my actual implementation is more dealing with projects.  I don't work from MM for everything.  For one thing, it would take too long. ;-)</div>
