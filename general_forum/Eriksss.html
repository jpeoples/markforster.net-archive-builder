<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-12-7 23:51</div>
<div class="content">Sorry for this seemingly random thread but I'm amazed at the number of "Erik"s on this site. What I mean is that growing up in Qu√©bec, my generation had a lot of Eric or Erick. It was a popular name. But I was the only one with a "Viking style" k only name. Almost all of my life I rarely encountered the name let alone meet one in person. Now we are 3 on this site!<br><br>Is there something to say about name and way of thinking being related or am I just rambling?</div>

<div class="content">Well, since you bring it up, I go by Elynn online, but my name is actually Erika.</div>

<div class="content">Proud to represent the Erik presence on Mark's website. I live in Minnesota, US. My mother would jokingly say that I was named Erik because I come from good, Scandinavian stock.</div>

<div class="content">Greetings, fellow namesakes!<br><br>Yes, it is quite amazing isn't it.<br><br>I thought it was great when Erik Lorrain signed up, as I'd been lurking for a while before he came along.  And we now have Erik from Minnesota and Erika too!  What are the odds of that?<br><br>I'm a New Zealander myself, though my mother is Dutch and chose my name based on a book she'd read which had a character named Erik in it.  Like Erik L., I was the only person who had this spelling of my name when I was growing up...and lots of people still get the spelling wrong.<br><br>I wonder how many people are registered for this site in total...it'd be interesting to compare the percentage of Eriks on this site with the percentage in the overall population...</div>

<div class="content">There are 108 people registered on this site, of whom three have Erik as part of their display name. <br><br>The problem with comparing this with the population at large is: the population of what? The world as a whole? Not too many Eriks in China, Japan, and Korea I should think, to mention a few countries with a large internet presence. <br><br>I used to work in a small organisation of about 40 people (all men). Three of them had the first name Vernon.</div>

<div class="content">I can think of at least one Erik in Japan...<br><br>From now on I am to be known as Erik_the_Pink.<br><br><a href="http://www.imdb.com/media/rm488607488/tt1242545" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/media/rm488607488/tt1242545</a> (I know: poor spelling)</div>

<div class="content">Well, "Erika" is a not entirely uncommon female first name in Japan.</div>

<div class="content">If ever there are some that don't know already, I'm the Erik Lorrain.<br>When we had to register, I shortened it but then I saw a few others and hence this post.<br><br>One of my friends said to me once that this spelling was english, I said it was scandinavian and from reading the posts here, I can definitely put the finger on who was right ;)<br><br>So yep, we have at least one in Japan LOL<br>Erika is very common in Japan but in my book, it counts but only for foreigners.<br>So welcome to the club Elynn.<br>I'll also cut you in for good measure Seraphim :)<br><br>By the way Will, I found why development has stopped on my website. As you so graciously pointed in one of your blog posts, my site was free of advertising. I then put some in for God knows what reason. I just don't want to see the face of my site anymore!!! I'll get rid of all of that ASAP but keep the couple affiliates I have though since I don't put them in the same basket.</div>

<div class="content">When I met my wife back in the Jurassic era, I found her birthday was the closest to my own ever till then, by two days.<br><br>After that, no-one remotely close until the day I turned 50 and I was working in Zambia in Africa when I came across two people with the SAME day as me ie on that day: one a fellow consultant 10 years older, the other a lovely lithe Moroccan girl on the running machine next to me in the gym.<br><br>Note to Roger L: are we going to put up with all these namesakes for much longer???</div>
