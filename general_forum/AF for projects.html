<div class="content">Projects seem to come in 4 sizes:<br>1) Small ones you just pull out and do<br>2) Medium ones you keep a few notes or a short list of things to do<br>3) Large ones with myriads of big and small details to take care of.<br>4) Gigantic ones that coordinate lots of people.<br><br>IWhen I go set a couple hours to work on #3 large projects, I flip to a different notebook and there are two parts to it: Organized notes about the project, and a long list of large and little things that need doing in the project.  <br><br>Without this list, it gets to be like life-management itself: Amid all flurry of things demanding attention, important details get neglected.  With the list, it's easy to pick a task, do it, pick another, do it, remember something that needs doing, enter it.<br><br>I see an AF4 system serving well for that list, but other AF varieties could work as well.  If the project is smaller than having dozens of items, a simple list serves.  I never tackled huge projects.</div>

<div class="content">Almost all of my professional work is in the form of #3. I still haven't found a satisfactory means of handling it. Right now, I'm trying to use mind maps to break a #3 project into several #2 or even #1 projects. I don't have any real "project management" training or experience, so "project management" software has shown itself to be too much of a hurdle for me right now.</div>

<div class="content">My experience with project management software, Gantt charts et al., was a failure. All those charts looked good but failed to properly predict work. And since few people worked on the projects, sophisticated scheduling was worthless as well. <br><br>Just an Af list is easy and gets stuff towards done.</div>

<div class="content">Well, I've handled the full gamut of projects from 1 to 4 and they all basically boil down to issuing clear instructions, following up hard, keeping adequate records and keeping progress under constant review. The D-Day landings were managed without project management software, and I'm not convinced that they were any the worse for that.</div>
