<div class="content">Mark recommended this some time ago in the blog<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2008/12/28/review-the-to-do-list-by-mike-gayle.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2008/12/28/review-the-to-do-list-by-mike-gayle.html</a><br><br>and I just wanted to bump it to the top for anyone who missed it. It's an excellent piece of writing and bears on our common project. Interestingly the author tackles some things by choosing tasks which stand out.<br><br>It's also very funny.</div>

<div class="content">I can't remember whether it was due to Mark's recommendation or not - I think it probably was - but I read this book and really enjoyed it.  I have since tried one of  his novels with less success!<br><br>Lucy</div>

<div class="content">It was an interesting experience reading this book. I hadn't realised how much fiction goes into a "documentary" book. He changed the sequence of events in which he contacted me, and I'm pretty sure that some of the advice I gave him ended up in the mouth of someone else - what's more I don't think he completed as much of the list as he gave the impression he did!<br></div>

<div class="content">THANKS for spotlighting this, Laurence! Yes, I had missed the original post by Mark. I've just begun reading this and am quite enjoying it. :o)  and finding it kind of inspirational! I don't have a thousand-plus item AF list, but it's really interesting to read his account and to see Mark in the pages, too!</div>

<div class="content">>One thing I need to write a blog post about is what advice I would give Mike Gayle now that my new Autofocus system has been published.<br><br>MARK: would LOVE to read a new blog post on this!!</div>

<div class="content">I also read Mark's post back in December and was inspired to buy it. He's not an author I was aware previously, his other books looking like novels on bloke-tales-as-they-move-towards-responsibilities, so was intrigued.<br><br>It actually turned out to be a really enjoyable book. He writes with a nice, comedic, gentle style, and it's a great idea for a book. Who hasn't got a huge bundle of stuff that they never get round to doing, which might make their own and friends and familiy's lives easier, better or happier? He creates his huge list, with a range of tasks from the sublime to the ridiculous, from the superficial to the profound, from the selfish to the altruistic. After contacting Mark (in a very brief sequence which the author doesn't really explain what he has learned and how he is going to use it!) he sets off on his quest. He only talks about some of the tasks in great detail, but writes about them well and the good effects they have on him and others. <br><br>One of the curious things was that after I started reading the book I always kept my AF notebook with me. As I went through it gave me ideas or reminders of things that had disappeared from view (having not had AF in the past nor a "grasscutter" place to keep them). This ranged from reminders of old friends to see, to practicalities that need reviewing, to film ideas. In the appendix is a full list of the 1277 items he had on his which I also scanned at the end of the book for further inspiration.<br><br>My ten year old daughter was intrigued by the idea of the book and has since read it - twice. It made her laugh and also think, and she now has her own journal to write down stories, dreams, ideas and things to do. No AF list yet....<br><br>Well worth a read.<br><br>Regards<br>Jonathan</div>

<div class="content">One interesting thing about his To Do List, is that he seemed to include a "because" for each item. For example, 'Spend quality time with your mum because she's not always going to be around.' 'Get rid of your AOL account because it's just beyond ridiculous that you've been paying them 11.99 pounds a month for a service that you don't even use any more.' 'Tidy home so that when people visit you no longer have to wear the shroud of shame.' <br><br>This may have been more of a literary device (the listing in the appendix doesn't seem to include the "becauses" for each, as the narrative does), but I thought it an interesting addition to the basic "to-do".</div>
