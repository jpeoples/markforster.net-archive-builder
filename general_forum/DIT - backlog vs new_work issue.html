<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">Hello!<br><br>I am on week 2 of DIT, and loving it so far! It seems to address my weaknesses very well. I have some tasks that I don't know how to address though... It is the first thing I can't figure out with the book/articles/forum posts...<br><br>Background info: I have a BIG backlog, mainly tasks/projects, many of them with deadlines within a month or two. I am a stay-at-home homeschool mom of 5 girls aged 2 to 11. I found out through my first 2 DIT weeks than I can work on my backlog approx. 15 min daily Monday to Friday consistently, sometimes more, and on Saturdays usually more. 3 girls have to take yearly exams in public school in June, and these exams are the priority until they are finished.<br><br>Now to the specifics: I am behind on seasonal clothes change for my daughters. Some categories of clothes were on my backlog list specifically, for example pants and skirts. One category of clothes came up a few days ago: my eldest needs bigger fleece jackets. Actually it would be new work... <br>Except that<br>1) I am currently going through the pants needs during my backlog time<br>2) For efficiency reasons it makes more sense to check one clothes category for all the daughters in a row, in order to make one online order for what I need after checking storage and passing things down<br>3) I go nuts if during the same day I am working on pants for my backlog and another clothes category for my today-work<br>4) AND after the pants I still have the skirts to go through, which are more urgent than jackets.<br><br>I thought of<br>a- considering seasonal clothes change as one big project in my backlog, writing the jackets category there and continuing to work on my backlog in order of urgency - but I seem to add to my backlog in some way, which I shouldn't do...<br>b- working on the jackets as today-work and do minimum backlog work on that day to prevent brain overwhelm? but it puts the more urgent backlog pants further back...<br>c- force myself to tackle both clothes categories the same day (maybe at clearly separated times of the day to help my brain cope?), but it seems overwhelming to me as I already have a tendency to spread my focus too thin...<br><br>What do you recommend?</div>

<div class="content">Pull the clothing stuff out of the backlog. I guess your backlog is also your Current Initiative? So, work on your CI as per DIT rules first thing.<br><br>On your today list / today tasks / task diary, you have one and only one item: seasonal clothes. That's it one project for the whole clothing stuff.<br><br>So, work your CI and then work your Today. When the "seasonal clothes" item comes up, you work on the clothes as you see fit for the day.<br><br>You may want to have additional jottings, notes, plans whatever for your clothings project, fine. As with any other project as well, you may maintain project materials outside the DIT Task Diary.<br><br>But have just one task on your Today list.<br><br>I hope this is helpful, if not, please complain, I'll try again.</div>

<div class="content">Yes, my backlog is my Current Initiative.<br>What you recommends makes totally sense! I will put all the clothes stuff in one big active project outside the backlog. Actually I was kind of doing this before DIT but somehow the backlog declaration bugged me in that area. So it should be very easy for me to do it that way. I already have the related lists in my project materials anyway. The only maybe-non-pure-DIT thing I need is to write for every day the next action for each project on my will-do list after the project tag, otherwise I procrastinate on starting work.<br>Thank you so much!</div>
