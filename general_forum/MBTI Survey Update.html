<div class="content">At last here are the results from the Myers briggs survey, which make for interesting reading:-<br><br>40 people responded of which 25% were INTJ<br><br>The total responses were <br><br>INTJ - 10 _______________ ENFP - 4<br>INFP - 8   ________________ ESTJ - 2<br>INTP - 7   ________________ ENTJ - 1<br>INFJ - 4   ________________ ENTP - 1<br>ISFJ - 1    ________________ ESFJ - 1<br>ISTJ - 1<br><br>Interestingly a survey conducted in the US showed only 2.1% of the surveyed people to be INTJ, with the largest sector being ISFJ at 13.8%.<br><br>However, when you break it down further you will see that 35 of the 40 respondees were "N" (Intuition), and 31 were "I" (Introvert), the other characteristics being fairly evenly balanced.<br><br>For those wanting to know a little more about the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, Wikipedia has a comprehensive summary at<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator</a><br><br>However I think it is worth extracting a couple of points here (for those that don't want to spend hours reading online!). <br><br>Re Intuition (N) & Sensing (S)<br>"Sensing and intuition are the information-gathering (perceiving) functions. They describe how new information is understood and interpreted. Individuals who prefer sensing are more likely to trust information that is in the present, tangible and concrete: that is, information that can be understood by the five senses. They tend to distrust hunches that seem to come out of nowhere. They prefer to look for details and facts. For them, the meaning is in the data. On the other hand, those who prefer intuition tend to trust information that is more abstract or theoretical, that can be associated with other information (either remembered or discovered by seeking a wider context or pattern). They may be more interested in future possibilities. They tend to trust those flashes of insight that seem to bubble up from the unconscious mind. The meaning is in how the data relates to the pattern or theory."<br><br>The use of the terms introvert and extravert are also helpful as their meaning in Myers Briggs is not the generally accepted use of the words<br><br>Re: Extraversion (E) & Introversion (I)<br>"The terms extravert and introvert are used in a special sense when discussing the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. People who prefer extraversion draw energy from action: they tend to act, then reflect, then act further. If they are inactive, their level of energy and motivation tends to decline. Conversely, those whose prefer introversion become less energized as they act: they prefer to reflect, then act, then reflect again. People who prefer introversion need time out to reflect in order to rebuild energy.<br><br>The extravert's flow is directed outward toward people and objects, and the introvert's is directed inward toward concepts and ideas. There are several contrasting characteristics between extraverts and introverts: extraverts are action-oriented and desire breadth, while introverts are thought-oriented and seek depth. Extaverts often prefer more frequent interaction, while introverts prefer more substantial interaction."<br><br>Hope that is of interest to all those who posted - the results are certainly interesing but as with all surverys, does it actually mean anything? :-)<br><br> <br></div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Christine. The results are fascinating, but I'm wondering whether they relate to people who get on well with AF, or people who like posting on this type of blog??</div>

<div class="content">That's a very good question - no idea as to the answer! :-)</div>

<div class="content">Christine:<br><br>Thank you!<br><br>I am an INTJ and a DIT user.<br><br>What would also be intersting is the sex distribution of the types, e.g. how many female and how many male INTJs did you find?<br><br>That INTJs come out at the top of the list is not surprising, because they are also described as the "managers"; I would have expected an even bigger share.<br><br>In my humble opinion personality types play a big role in the way we work and in the way we choose our systems; that has hardly been acknowledged so far. <br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Chris<br><br>I didn't analyse the male/female split but if you wish to check the link to the original post is <br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/625924" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/625924</a>  <br><br>I totally agree that personality types plays a big role in how we work as do a number of other factors, communication styles, previous occupations (and consequent learned behavioural attitudes) self confidence/self esteem levels - I guess a book (or two) could be written on that subject alone ............<br><br>If you wanted to start a post I'm sure it would receive response :-)<br></div>
