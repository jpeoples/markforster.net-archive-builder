<div class="content">Hi all - Lent ended on Thursday, April 17 -- how did you do with your challenge?<br><br>I was using serial no-list but that method petered out during a period where I was planning my job exit due to retirement and a busy period of work in our cohousing community. I got very distracted and my methods became rather haphazard. I never cleaned out my inboxes, just responded to what was most urgent. So it goes.<br><br>That said -- nothing really fell apart so ... maybe I'm not as busy as I think I am? Time to review my someday/maybe tasks!</div>

<div class="content">Fail, but I did reboot it a few times. Latest run is almost 2 weeks.</div>

<div class="content">FAIL.  I was surprised to see I had written down Serial No-List.  Sometime soon after that, I switched to DIT.  I've been trying to implement it in Asana and it's been going pretty well.  Instead of the usual audit process, tasks that extend to more than a week overdue move automatically to a Simple Scanning list, where they stay for up to a month, then they move to Dismissed.  I scan those if/when I complete my DIT list for the day.  Optional tasks that I don't want to delete also get moved to the Simple Scanning list.  This combination seems to work really well for me.</div>

<div class="content">I was tempted to change to a different system, but I stuck with it. It's nothing magical, and I do feel discontent with my progress, but I'm not sure that's the system's problem at this point. :-)</div>

<div class="content">I didn’t keep on top of the system, and I also retweaked it a couple times.  No pass for me.</div>
