<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>Is this your last version of Autofocus -- version 4 -- now that you are enjoying retirement (which you should be!).   I was just wondering if you would continue to work on time management systems or is the latest version your final gift to us all?<br><br>Best regards,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">As you may have deduced by now, Mark has a difficult time with a "sit around and do nothing" type of retirement. While I am sure he enjoys the freedom to choose, my bet is that just for fun, he chooses something we will enjoy too.</div>

<div class="content">Many people here have also played a part in the development of AF4 (otherwise we might still be at AF1). It's been a unique collaborative experience (I am unaware of such a thing having happened before). It reminds me of open software development.<br><br>Thanks again to Mark and all others here who have influenced the evolution of this system.<br><br>I wonder if we have now reached the point of diminishing returns or is it worth trying to improve the algorithm further?</div>

<div class="content">Laurence,<br><br>As you indicated, AF4 developed organically as a result of the collaboration of the users here.  As we worked with it, we found various versions inadequate for our needs and so the next version was developed by Mark.  That there has been no further development lately is probably due to the robustness of the full set of AF versions.  AF4 is the best for most, but some might be happier with the way previous versions work for them.  Most of us use AF in conjunction with other tools and in our own particular ways.  I suspect that there is no reason for anything further, other than the tweaks each of us make on our own.<br><br>As it is now, the forum serves to answer questions from new AF user and discuss other time management topics, as well as various off-topic things that occur in any social group.  I.E. it's a warm and friendly place with familiar faces ;-)</div>

<div class="content">I think AF is done, and all that remains is<br>1) Make a more complete writeup of AF4<br>2) Write a book explaining all the ins and outs.<br>3) World speaking tour!<br><br>None of which really needs to be done so long as there's an active community discussing the system.  Actually, since Mark has created this self-running community, pretty much all of it could happen apart from Mark even though he would likely do a better job himself.<br><br>(For Mark's monetizing thread: license the rights to somebody else to promote AutoFocus for him :-)</div>

<div class="content">David:<br><br>To answer your orginal question, I've been experimenting with some new methods - but with not much success. I've now decided to go back to AF4 and work it as hard as I can.</div>

<div class="content">"I've been experimenting with some new methods - but with not much success. I've now decided to go back to AF4 and work it as hard as I can."<br><br>The last time you said something like that ("Back to Autofocus" article), you had a new system out within two weeks. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the update, Mark.  I will be interested to see how you do working AF4 hard -- perhaps some new ideas?  <br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark ! Happy to see you back ! So I am (after a few month of a lot of work but it's much cooler now ;) )<br><br>You said " I've been experimenting with some new methods - but with not much success. I've now decided to go back to AF4 and work it as hard as I can."<br><br>I have also hardly worked with AF4 and i can say now that it works very well with me. <br>I only added 3 small rules that i want to share with you all. <br><br>1. Always read the ALL LISTS in the morning (it's the first thing i do after reading my emails and repport my tasks on AF4<br><br>2. Put a dash . in front of all urgent tasks and report them at the end of AF4 is they are on my backlog and reformulate them if necessary. <br><br>3. Begin my day by the end of my active List with my dash things and then be back on the back log UNTIL nothing is activable on the backlog AND then goto my active list and follow the method. <br><br>It works perfectly since the beginning of AF4 and i have never worked so hard and efficiently. <br><br>Of course i still use GTD for my projects and Omnifocus as a tickler but my main system is AF4. What else ? ;))</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jup.  Your thoughts resonate with me, and especially when I haven't been consistently working the system and need to catch up.  Q's:<br><br>Item 2, you mean "IF they are on my backlog", not IS, right?  Now, by Report, do you mean to copy urgent backlogged tasks to the end of the active (open) list, or do you mean to move them there, or what?<br><br>Item 3, I think you mean to act on all dashed items once, and then jump into AF4 normal process?</div>

<div class="content">@Alan  Hi<br>"Item 2, you mean "IF they are on my backlog", not IS, right? Now, by Report, do you mean to copy urgent backlogged tasks to the end of the active (open) list, or do you mean to move them there, or what?" YES it is IF<br><br>- there are 2 list the backlog (the old items) and the active list (the new ones)<br>Some urgent item may remains or become urgent and must be done immediatly. But more often infos are coming during the day and can't wait. Reportig all my dash (ie the things i must do fastly) after reading them on my active list EVEN reformulating them make me focus on the urgent and important things first. Then if they are done i have my all time to do the things left wich are on my backlogs. It's a way for me to focus on the most valuable stuff first (this is one thing i learnt by Mark forster (thanks to him) when i was overwhelmed. <br><br><br>Item 3, I think you mean to act on all dashed items once, and then jump into AF4 normal process? <br><br>- Absolutly the AF4 process is indeed perfect for me. If i dont go back on the backlogs then i will only work on the last incoming items. As you see and as i said I strictly respect AF4 process exept point 3 that i do at the beginning of the day and twice ou 3 times a week when the activity becomes so hot than it is unmanageable...<br><br>Hope that's clear and help.</div>

<div class="content">I made a mistake on the last sentence read "twice or 3 time a day not a week ;)</div>
