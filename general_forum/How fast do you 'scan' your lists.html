<div class="content">I have a little question that originates from my amazement how many times Mark seems to be cycling through his AF/DWM lists on an average day.<br><br>From the stats of his Day 3, it seems he has around 300 tasks on his list. Meanwhile he said somewhere on the forum that he did the "Comments" task 21 times on one day, meaning that he cycled his complete list, 21 times or somewhat less. At 300 tasks, that means he scanned roughly 300 x 20 = 6000 tasks. Assuming 1 second to read per task and figure out if it stands out, that means he spent almost 2 hours just looking at his list.<br><br>Obviously, something's wrong with either my reasoning, or my own behaviour while going through my list.<br><br>I can only conclude that either he literally scans his list, as if he were scanning a book (looking at maybe 10 spots on a single page, looking for words that stand out as important), or that you sometimes already have a task to do in mind and move to that position on the list, whereby you don't scan the tasks that came before it, i.e. shortcutting the list.<br><br>Mark, can you please explain to me how exactly you go about scanning your list?<br><br>How do other people do it?<br><br>Thanks,<br>Tijl</div>

<div class="content">Note: in reality I'm not as slow as 1 second per task, but assuming 15 mins of browsing through the list per day at 6000 tasks, it means Mark would be scanning at 7 tasks per second. So... either he is scanning fast, and not really reading everything on the list, or he's shortcutting. Right?</div>

<div class="content">After nearly a year of using Mark's systems, here's what I've found: I usually have a pretty good idea of what's on the list at any given time.  And so I'm not really READING each item so much as ... taking it in?  <br><br>I do think there's a flaw in your math though - say "Comments" was entered as a new task on day 1 of Mark's DWM trial, so it went on the M(onth) page.  The first time he did it, it got re-entered on the W(eek) page.  After that, it's just going to get re-entered on the appropriate W page.  So if he gets to page W, checks comments, and re-enters it at the bottom of that list, he could conceivably do that same task quite a few times without ever leaving page W.  I have a page that was page W a couple of days ago that's FULL of stuff like that - the same 4 or 5 tasks entered over and over as I worked "little and often" on various parts of a grant proposal, just going round and round on the same handful of things but never leaving that one page.<br><br>Make sense?</div>

<div class="content">Tijl:<br><br>Sarah is correct."Comments" frequently gets re-entered several times while I am still on the one page. <br><br>As for my actual scanning technique, I do it with a pen in hand and pause momentarily at each task. I think it's important to actually read each task and not to skip over any without looking at them.</div>
