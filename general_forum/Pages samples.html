<div class="content"><br>Hi erveryone<br><br>So far, with my Agenda/AF set up, I never needed to add more than 28 tasks a day. And in average, I turn at a speed of around 20 tasks a day.<br>I'm confused and I maybe don't really understand the kind of tasks you put in your list.<br><br>Would it be possible for some of you to post pages samples (if no too personal)?<br><br>Thanks<br>Pascal</div>

<div class="content">Hi Pascal<br><br>I work with both home and work style items in my lists.  Here is a sample of items I have on my lists - generally routine tasks only get added to the list if I feel they are not being done "automatically". For example I would not put "stack dishwasher" on the list on a regular basis but if my kitchen needed clearing it could get added as a constituent task.<br><br>Check email<br>Check schedule<br>Coffee<br>Thinking Time<br>Print VAT report<br>VAT return<br>Mail VAT return<br>Set up list of projects<br>Check out x seminar<br>Go to Cinema (7 lbs)<br>Read 39 Steps<br>Arrange meeting w/x<br>Scanning<br>Filing<br>Clean coffee table<br>Check courses available for carers<br>Contract of employment for x<br>Buy fuse for hi-fi speaker<br>Check fuse for hi-fi speaker<br>Set up system for x<br>Plan weekend away<br>Packing list<br>Prepare talk for x<br>Prepare powerpoint presentation for talk<br>Locate music for ppt presentation<br>Locate gif file for ppt<br>Decide about event on Friday<br>Add Dad's appointment to schedule<br>Review new car info for Dad<br>Has x called back? <br>Work on project x<br>Add x to shopping list<br><br>Hope that helps?</div>

<div class="content">I've been interested to read how the phrasing of the task entry can make a difference to the resistance to the task. Christine B pointed out the difference between 'Look for item X' and 'Find item X' - the latter offering more resistance because it seems to demand a positive outcome.<br><br>For most of my entries I take it a step further, perhaps, and don't even bother with a verb! Fortunately I only occasionally get caught out and think, "what did I mean there?". I also add abbreviations (yes, I can remember what they are!). <br><br>E.g.<br>...Email<br>Vitamin<br>NF<br>SS<br>Kitchen<br>Pilates<br>Washing<br>FOE<br>MF forum<br>Mum party<br>Mum cake<br>Suzanne<br>shears<br>Co-op<br>Millie Mon<br>AFI policies...<br><br>As is reasonably obvious, it's a home list. My work is largely self-contained and I keep that on separate pages (1.75 active pages at the mo).<br><br>A lot of my home tasks are recurrent - daily or near-daily. I'm hoping that they will become habitual soon so that I can avoid the inefficiency of entering the tasks every day. But I'll keep adding them until I can pretty much guarantee that I will still do them, even when I get home from shift work.  I guess this is largely my goal for AF - get/ keep organised despite working intensive shifts.<br><br>Happy AFing!</div>

<div class="content">Naomi,<br><br>thanks for sharing...<br>one information: your "Prepare presentation for C" appears at the beggining and at the end of your list...is it the same (a reminder?) or you split it(how?) in subtasks?<br><br>thanks<br><br>Alessandro M.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-02-9 11:13</div>
<div class="content">Alessandro,<br>Thanks for your question. In answer the item "prepare presentation for C" is the same thing. The first entry of it at the beginning of the list has been actioned (it is preceded by a * here to indicate this).  In other words I did some work on the presentation, crossed it off the list and added it again to the list - actually on the same day a few lines down. I again did something on it, crossed it off and added it again at the end of the list. I haven't been more specific in detailing what to do because I just need to keep moving on it and I am less likely to panic if I just write a general phrase for it at the moment!<br>Hope that clarifies things<br>Naomi</div>

<div class="content">A question.  so far this system is working great for shorter, daily tasks.  what about longer term projects.  I find myself not getting to some household projects (like painting a room).  Autofocus seems to say to delete things you don't get to.  I don't want to do that. Do I just keep adding them to the next page until I get to them?<br><br>Maybe I misunderstood the directions.<br><br>tom</div>

<div class="content">Tom:<br><br>It sounds to me as if you misunderstood the directions. You don't delete items from a page unless you have done no items on that page on that visit to the page.<br><br>I suggest you re-read the instructions carefully.</div>

<div class="content">tom p,<br><br>The point of AF is to work, as much as possible, "little and often." Do you have the paint already purchased? Have the walls and moldings already been prepared? Do you have brushes, rollers, dropcloths, and mixers? (Pardon my American English. You might call some of these things by different names.) Do you want to do the actual painting all in one day?<br><br>I might make a list for things to buy. I'd then cross the item off my list, and add it again at the end of the list. If it was going to take 8 hours to do the actual painting, I'd put it on my calendar (outside the AF list.)</div>
