<div class="content">So, I've been struggling with AF in a lot of ways, and avidly reading about how other people have struggled. (I'm still kind of skeptical but still giving it a shot, so we'll see.)<br><br>It seems to me that a lot of my problem, and a lot of other people's problems, can be abstracted and generalized out into expecting this system to work with the systems we've already set up, instead of just throwing everything into AF and letting it sort itself out. The "reply to e-mail within 24 hours rule" that's been mentioned a few times is a good example. That's a pre-existing rule, and isn't supported all that well with AF--but by using AF, you (may) eventually realize that there's no need to have that rule, that the important things get taken care of, and let AF restructure things for you, into a new structure you never would have thought of yourself. <br><br>So, Mark, maybe one thing to consider adding to the next generation of instructions is a paragraph addressing this further. Let people know that this will be a lot easier if they start with a blank slate and not a raft of pre-existing systems. Encourage them to set the old stuff aside for a while and see what new systems emerge with AF. This can be kind of threatening if you've put a lot of energy into your old systems; for me, at least, it would have been easier if I'd known that up front, instead of having to figure it out by banging my head on it for a week, and having Mark patiently explain it repeatedly.<br><br>The instructions do say "trust the system" -- I think I would have had a slightly easier time of it with some of the ramifications of that explored a little more. Christine and plenty of other people got it immediately, but a quick trip through the forums makes it clear that I'm not the only one trying to fit the square peg of old systems into AF. <br><br>My 2 cents. <br><br>Cheers,<br>Beth</div>

<div class="content">Hi Beth<br><br>I was very fortunate to have looked at other ways of intuitive working previously which did help me to "get it" almost immediately, but only because I already understood how it "felt" to work intuitively.  When I had gotten to that point before I could never maintain it because I was never able to work out how I had actually achieved it in the first place.  Even so my initial reaction to the system was more along the lines of "huh? well how can that work then?"   <br><br>It also helped being familiar enough with Mark's previous systems that it was a case of "well if Mark says it works then I'll give it a go"; that would probably not have been my rational response if I had just read this somewhere else.<br><br>Actually reading this makes me realise just how much of the way we approach things is down to past experience, belief structures etc.  It is hard to let go of what we have been conditioned to almost believe is "the best way", even when we know it is not working for us. <br><br>I found Marks comment a bottom up approah very helpful in the following post<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/626319" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/626319</a><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Beth,<br><br>I know what you mean.  Fortunately, I had given up on GtD and revered back to a TODO list and a calendar.  When I saw AutoFocus, I was not in the mind set of deciding on contexts and such.  All I did was clean up my TODO list and continue to use my calendar.  The main difference was in the WAY I used the TODO list, IOW, the way I saw items and pages and rewrote the partially completed things at the end of the list.<br><br>One thing I think Mark has emphasized is to use common sense.  If something needs to be done now, it does not need to go on a list of any kind ... it needs to be DONE NOW.  Likewise, these systems don't support repetitive tasks very well, nor should they be expected to.  To reduce it to absurdity to make the point ... I get dressed every morning when I get up ... it is a habit so I don't need to consult a list to make sure I don't wander out of the house buck naked ;-)  IOW, for repetitive actions it may be best to use a different system ... perhaps some 3x5 cards for each thing that needs to be done periodically and tie it to some kind of habitual review.  Repetitive things like "answer email" CAN be managed by autofocus, but really, if my job involves answering email I'm not likely to forget to do it.  It will have become a habit for me.<br><br>However, I agree with Mark in that it probably only takes a few minutes to get through all of the pages so nothing is really going to "get lost" in this system.  So my suggestion to Mark would be that he address the "common sense" issue in more detail in future descriptions.  Also to point out that an entire cycle through the pages is likely to be much quicker than initially thought.  With continually adding new items as well as uncompleted items to the bottom, anything is likely to percolate to the top in short order.</div>
