<div class="content">Hi,<br><br>I only started using DWM two weeks ago, so I guess I should wait at least one month before reaching conclusions... but...<br><br>... I'm not experiencing any pressure to do my tasks. By chance, most of them are not urgent, and not particularly fun, pretty gray tasks, but important nonetheless.<br>The thing is, I'm having a WHOLE month, so I don't feel the need to work on them. And I should!<br>The same goes for re-entered tasks. I work a little, and then I have a full week until I pick it up again.<br><br>I really like the concept of DWM, but I feel that it should be more demanding. I remember the pressure of AF2. It was a race! I know... I didn't let a month pass, but I have the feeling that it won't be much different.<br><br>Did anybody try to use, lets say: two weeks for new tasks, and three days for those that were re-entered?<br><br>Thanks,<br>Walter</div>

<div class="content"><< I'm not experiencing any pressure to do my tasks>><br><br>Do you believe if the deadline was altered, the pressure would be enough of a motivator? At the end of the day, you can still ignore the system and do whatever you like. <br><br><<not urgent, and not particularly fun, pretty gray tasks, but important nonetheless>><br><br>Sounds like a recipe for procrastination. When I have too many of these, my emphasis shifts from my system to my life goals. Of course, major events (birth, death, illness, etc) throw wrenches into the best of plans, providing many "not particularly fun, pretty gray tasks, but important nonetheless" to content with. <br><br><<The same goes for re-entered tasks. I work a little, and then I have a full week until I pick it up again.>><br><br>I'm finding the 7 day threat provides enough of a threat to keep working. Moreover, if a honking chunk of tasks appear as "due today", I know I'm taking on too much. <br><br><<I feel that it should be more demanding>><br><br>I felt the same way at the 2 wk mark. <br><br><<Did anybody try to use, lets say: two weeks for new tasks, and three days for those that were re-entered?>><br><br>Walter, at the end of the day, we really should strive to have tasks/projects on our lists that represent "the best in us". The deadlines serve as anchors, but really that's all they are. If you have a chunk of new projects/tasks that you haven't touched in 29 days, you might want to consider where you're time/energy is going. <br><br>Best of luck.</div>

"<br><br>I suspect that it's not ideal, but I really use deadlines as motivators. <br>I could skip the system, but then I'd lose its balancing aspect (give a chance to items that supposedly have less priority)<br><br>I'll give an example: I have to complete my LinkedIn profile.<br><br>I have my job, and nobody's firing me, but I feel that I have to make a step (find another job).<br>I feel HUGE resistance to do that, and I have a full month to push it forward.<br><br>Eventually, the expiration will arrive, and I will do it, I know I will. This is how my mind works, under pressure.<br>Now, if the deadline would be two weeks from now, I would be finishing my task earlier.<br><br>As I said... I could "manually" set an expiration to one week from now, but I like the regulating aspect of having a system.<br><br>Now...<br><br>"I felt the same way at the 2 wk mark."<br><br>That's good to hear :-)<br><br>Walter<br><br>PS: Suddenly I remember that I presented the same example about the CV when I was having trouble with AF1 !! It's almost a year after that and I'm still stuck with that!</div>

And though I still need to "look for work" i.e. clients, speaking gigs, etc., the paradigm/meaning has changed.

<div class="content">vegheadjones - Your comment relates to a problem I'm having. If a task's do-something-by date is 30 days out, I may make a decision NOT to do anything on it because I know if I tackle it and don't finish, then I have only SEVEN days to get back to it. If I let it ride at the 30-day, then maybe when It's down to 14 days, I'll think about it. To me, it almost seems like a punishment to work on far out items (time-wise) since my next time-frame is much shorter. I'm still trying to follow the system as is, though, for a few more months.</div>

<div class="content">Not feeling pressure is a bad thing? <br><br>The world sometimes needs your help; most of the time it doesn't. Lighten up. <br><br>It is strange the absence of a familiar anxiety can cause and condition another. <br><br>The fact that almost no one here gives any version of AF an honest go for more than a few days, lest months, before reporting how it is failing, is testament to the fact you are stuck believing things require your help which don't. And you probably are unable to hear the needs of those that require your help due to your desire to cling to your fantasies.<br><br>Why not choose any AF and stick with it no matter the anxiety or "problems" for six months. No hacks, no tweaks etc. I assure you the world will not end (at least not due to your commitment).<br><br>Or just be honest that you will forever cling to the ideas that you have held onto forever about your importance and the amount of work you need to do, no matter how miserable you are. <br><br>Write down for your largest project: continual frustration punctuated by brief hope of change when some promising system comes along which I will abandon once significant changes begins to occurs.<br><br>Or you could just give up on your fantasies and commit yourself to a gentle discipline for a while and see what happens. The world might not die, but hopefully a good part of yourself might.<br><br>Good luck!</div>

<div class="content">Walter, you say you need more pressure, so follow your instinct and create some: Choose a task "out there" on your list and decide you will start working on it.  It moves to next week, and now you have pressure.  <br><br>You say some of your tasks are grey but important.  If they are really important, take courage and choose one important task, create a file, write a title, save it, and move on.  The task will move to next week, and now you must work on it at least once a week.<br><br>DWM gives you the tools to solve your problem.  It doesn't matter what you choose to act on (unless you think it does in which case choose what matters).  Just take two minutes, activate one task, and move on.  Problem solved.  Norman said self-discipline is primary.  *Do* what you *know* needs doing.  If you don't DWM will overwhelm you after three weeks of doing nothing.</div>

The way you understood his words is the same aswhat everyone else understood.<br><br>About your master list of what's important: I suggest you keep it, look at it every day, to keep these priorities in your mind. Then use your mind to choose what todo. You may choose what's on that list or otherwise.</div>

Honesty and humility are important.<br><br>There are a lot of people trying so hard to do things part of themselves think is so important. They also believe they are very important.<br><br>The world requires our help. Often the best way to find out how to help is to kill or let die that part of ourselves which gets in the helping of helping things get done that truly need our help.<br><br>AFx is a wonderful tool to that end (getting honest about the things which need your help getting done), if you don't tweak, hack, etc for it to accommodate the parts of yourself getting in the way.<br><br>Honesty sounds harsh at time.

<div class="content">Norman, are you suggesting that AF can tell us why we're not doing something? Or only that AF can indicate that WE should critically examine why? Don't you think that's what people on this forum are doing? I do. Just as it behooves us to consider what isn't working when we aren't getting things done, I think it behooves you to consider why people think you are harsh.</div>

<div class="content">Mel,<br><br>Most of the posts on this forum honestly are just people explaining to others the tweaks and hacks they have created to keep approaching things they way the always have. How that scales to the specifics of others' situations I have no idea. Many posts are about how to massage the dismissal process, which is IMO key to AF.<br><br>Other posts are simply about what the next system might be. Mark doesn't post for a few days and people fantasize about a new system.<br><br>Why others find my words harsh will be forever opaque to me. I do not believe I can make transparent the causes and conditions of my own attitudes, behaviors, etc, much less that of the world. That would be incredible arrogance.<br><br>But I do know honesty is often sounds harsh. And harm, polite. AF helps keep me honest. It doesn't really molly-coddle much. <br><br>The more interesting question is why would anyone concern themselves much about the tenor of the writing of someone on an internet forum.<br><br>If you can find an instance of crude or vulgar personal attack I have made, then I would like to know. I try to avoid that here. <br><br>Good luck!</div>

<div class="content">Norman's posts may be different from what we are used to hearing every day, but at least he is making good points, not flaming people for the sake of flaming people.<br><br>If you can get yourself to look past the "envelope" it's delivered in, there are good messages inside all of Norman's posts.  I personally appreciate the envelope he uses, since it adds variety to my forum reading, and often makes me chuckle.  I find that for me, it's worth the extra effort of unwrapping them (or re-framing them, as Chris pointed out).<br><br>If that's not the case for you, then you could merely skip over them.  There are some other regulars (no need to mention names, that list is probably different for everyone) whose posts I regularly skip over, after finding very low signal-to-noise ratio with them.  No harm done.<br><br>IMO, there are far more important things in the world be get upset about than the tone of internet message board posts.</div>

<div class="content">Norman, I know what you're saying. You sound a lot like American Idol's Simon Cowell. Like you, he would most likely deny making personal attacks. Yet, his comments sometimes are very cutting. Do you agree that you don't have to say, "Hey you, you're an idiot" to hurt people's feelings? <br><br>I'm a psychologist and I sometimes had to speak painful truths to my clients. The difference here is no one is paying you to tell it to them straight. It sounds like you do have some fans here who like your straight talk, however. You certainly don't have to take my advice (lol), but I find that asking questions to help people realize the truth accomplishes the same purpose without any hard feelings. I remember Mark asking me once why I had a problem with dismissal for AF1. He didn't say, "I don't get it," or "Words, words, words" which really would have come across to me as "You're an idiot." Instead, he enabled me to say that to myself. LOL <br><br>And rather than say "good luck" which can come across on this medium as sarcastic, I say best wishes, Norman.</div>

<div class="content">I didn't have much luck with dismissal in AF4.  I wound up just ignoring the whole list.  So far, I'm having much more luck with DWM.  For me, 30 days is enough time to either get started on a task or come to terms with the fact that it's not important enough to me to work on.  It's also enough pressure to encourage me to work on things I don't really want to but need to--without being so much that I ignore everything.<br><br>It does sound to me, from what I've read on the board, like DWMs pressure generally feels less than AFs, and that different people like whichever one they like because the pressure fits them best.</div>

<div class="meta">2010-03-2 13:24</div>
<div class="content">Walter: It worked in a somewhat opposite way for me. I did have a bunch of tasks at the 1 month mark when switching over from AF. At first, there wasn't much pressure. As I started facing some dismissals on the one week mark, the pressure was there and a couple of times, I *had* to dismiss tasks I didn't really want to dismiss. But I kept to the rules.<br><br>That is when I realised that there could be a couple things happening: either I was probably doing tasks that were far more important that those I dismissed, or I was procrastinating and letting things slip. It was a useful mental audit.<br><br>So, after that first hit, I now have developed an internal habit of trying not to bunch up too many tasks on the one week and one month mark. I try to complete or partially complete them, so they are constantly moving in my calendar. <br><br>Overally therefore, I would say the pressure is certainly there, but it took some time to develop.</div>

<div class="content">Walter, I again I don't understand the problem with dismissal with either AF or DWM. How is it less effective? Things either stand out or they don't. Maybe something changed from the transition to DWM I am not aware of, but for the power of AF comes from the increasing lack of pressure I feel to do things, not the opposite.</div>

<div class="content">Norman,<br><br>"Walter, I again I don't understand the problem with dismissal with either AF or DWM. How is it less effective?"<br><br>In AF (especially 2 and 3), the dismissal process was activated very quickly, which is what I'm missing by now. (I'm not sure if I was clear enough before. I am *missing* the old dismissal process, not complaining about it)<br><br>In DWM, and its (for me) long  term expiration, I still haven't reached that point.<br>In my case, only on started items, since I've been using the system for some 20 days. <br>When I start working on something, I usually keep doing it at least in a daily basis.<br>To be fair, I'm just being anxious, since I'm yet to cross the one month barrier.</div>

<div class="content">Walter,<br><br>The frequent cycling through the list and frequent exposure to each task helps your brain process them and decide what to do with them.<br><br>When you cycle through your list, if you realize there are tasks that you are never going to do, you can activate the "dismissal" yourself by simply deleting the tasks.<br><br>If you are still unsure about a task you can just wait till it expires.<br><br>Another thing -- I agree that the dismissal process doesn't really have the full effect until after you've been working the system for a full month.  Now that I'm beyond 30 days of usage, I'm finding that the DWM "dismissal" process is VERY effective.  There are plenty of tasks that are appearing on my first 7 days of pages that need attention very soon lest they expire.  <br><br>Personally I find this more compelling than AF1 -- especially the DIT-like effect of helping me gauge my total workload and whether I have too many commitments.  AF1 never really helped with that issue.</div>

<div class="content">"There are plenty of tasks that are appearing on my first 7 days of pages that need attention very soon lest they expire."<br><br>To be the one note wonder, it is this type of formulation of the dismissal process which I think is flawed. I like Mark's idea of tasks "standing out". <br><br>Almost nothing needs my attention. Something may need my attention if it is to remain on my AF list, but to me that is rigging the game to fit my expectations. If they "expire", what then?<br><br>Why not see if they stand out and let them go if they don't?<br><br>For some reason people are afraid of letting go of tasks they just are not doing. The salient question is why? <br><br>After doing this rigorously for sometime, I can see the patterns for myself. Again, if people just let things "expire", many of the posts on this forum would disappear as well.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim,<br><br>I agree. The dismissal mechanisms of the AFs tended to be erratic. The AF rules created situations where items could remain open for very short or very long time periods. DWM solves all that.<br><br>I know that, except for David Drake, I am probably the only regular participant here who thinks there was much good in GTD. Back in the day, pre-DIT, when I would roam David Allen's forum, there were constant discussions about what to put on the list. This was never specified in Allen's books. Some people would say that only stuff that would be actioned within the next week should be allowed.<br><br>I used to review my GTD list every week. And some stuff would sit there literally for years. And I am not talking about "Someday/Maybes" either. <br><br>GTD got me from undisciplined to sort-of disciplined. Each of Mark's successive systems--DIT, AF, DWM--have allowed me to strengthen my discipline a bit more. The leap from the AFs to DWM was bigger than that between any of the AFs.</div>

<div class="content">moises,<br><br>I loved GTD too and had the exact same problem with items sitting there forever. <br><br>Where I thik GTD got it wrong was the theory that if you break everything down into next actions, (and review them weekly) things won't sit on your list. Not true.<br><br>But write big things on a list--not just next actions--and give yourself a 30 day timer to just get an item started (or else) and you can bet things will either get moving or die.</div>

<div class="content">vegheadjones,<br><br><<Where I think GTD got it wrong was the theory that if you break everything down into next actions, (and review them weekly) things won't sit on your list. Not true.>><br><br>I agree with you. Furthermore, I think that Mark's Little and Often Principle preserves the tiny kernel of truth that lies within Allen's "next physical action" notion.<br><br>Where Allen went wrong was in requiring me to WRITE down the next physical action. Where Mark went right was in requiring me to DO any physical action (as in the paradigmatic "I'll just open the project folder").<br><br>My problem with Allen was that how I describe an action changes all the time. If I am charging forward and energized, I will say to myself "I am going to start writing this proposal." If I am anxious and fearful, I might say "I'll reread my notes from the last meeting." The point with L&O is that I can just write on my list "XYZ project" and as long as I do some physical action, I have (a) overcome inertia and started work on the project, and (b) I get the reward of being able to mark the item as done and the concomitant good feeling of knowing that I have moved the project forward.</div>

<div class="content">Norman,<br><br>"Why not see if they stand out and let them go if they don't?" <br><br>Interesting idea. I find that what stands out varies hugely depending on mood and pressure. If I've spent all day in meetings, I find that very little will stand out - otherwise I simply wouldn't get through the list. Similarly, if I have a major issue coming up, anything between my current task and actions to fix the issue is going to struggle to get my attention.</div>

<div class="content">It works, Norman!  I was feeling lazy today, and thinking I'll just ignore this dismissal thing and handle the tasks tomorrow.  Then I took your advice:<br>I looked at every task one at a time and said "I'm going to delete this now."  3 out of 4 I decided that would be a bad thing and instead got them out and worked on them.  The fourth I deleted, and Today is empty now.<br><br>Mark, pre-autofocus, suggested pairing tough tasks with semi-tough tasks, and the result will be choosing to do the semi-tough task.  That is the power of auto-dismissal: Between destroying a task and working on it, working is often the easier choice.  But either way you are taking a step forward.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br>"When you cycle through your list, if you realize there are tasks that you are never going to do, you can activate the "dismissal" yourself by simply deleting the tasks."<br><br>Sometimes there are some tasks that I'm never going to do... only if they are not in danger of dismissal.<br>This "threat" helps me beat the resistance against that task, and in many cases, after I start working on it even just a bit, the resistance vanishes and I can continue working on it without much trouble.<br>By manually deleting said task, I'm not giving it that last chance.</div>

<div class="content">True, but the question is whether it matters.  If the task is not really important, you might be better off *not* giving it that last chance.</div>

<div class="content">Aha - this is a key question if, like me, you resist dismissing.  It feels like it would be a failure. But more than once I have forced myself to start or keep going with a task, only to wonder at the end of it whether it was really worth it.  The discipline of AF or DWM encourages progress, which is satisfying at one level .  But at the higher level, you have to have the right things in the system in the first place, and they have to 'stand out' at least as much as the 'ought to' tasks which can divert time and energy instead.</div>

If they stand out, then they stand out. You can then work on them or let them go. We could mince words about what standing out means, this is why honesty is important. But I don't think anxiety is the same as a task standing out.<br><br>We could discuss this farther, but I am not sure how helpful it would be. <br><br>If you think my input would helpful I would be happy to offer it, but I will not engage in too much word mincing, pop-psych, or circumlocutions to accommodate the someone's possible fragile sensibilities.<br><br>Direct, honest, concrete speech. Using dismissal as a tool for discernment has been incredibly helpful for me.<br><br>Mark gave me a great tool for getting more realistic about how I spend my time.

<div class="content">Norman - <br><<<Why not see if they stand out and let them go if they don't?  For some reason people are afraid of letting go of tasks they just are not doing. The salient question is why? >>><br><br>You may disagree, but I don't think it's just a neurotic resistance to letting things go.  There's more to it than that, at least for me.<br><br>For some tasks, it's not a problem letting them go.  They were usually hare-brained ideas in the first place, or I am just not committed to them.   These aren't the ones facing expiration, at least not for me.  After seeing these kinds of tasks on my list repeatedly for several days, I realize I don't need to do them, don't want to do them, am not going to do them, and just delete them.  <br><br>A few of them really do stay around and end up "expiring", but by far most of the tasks facing expiration are not that kind of task.  Rather, they are tasks associated with some kind of commitment, and if I just let the task expire, then I am reneging on that commitment.  This is not acceptable to me.  If I am going to back out of a commitment, then I need to do that explicitly, and also work it out with any other people that may be involved.  It can affect my wife, my family, my coworkers, my boss, etc.  <br><br>Also, tasks of this kind don't have any problem "standing out" for me.  The problem is just that there are too many of them, and not enough hours in the day.  <br><br>More than any of the AF variations, DWM is helping me identify this kind of thing.  It is helping me realize what is getting in the way of meeting some of those commitments; to see what will really be required to meet them; and forcing me to decide what to drop, or at least what to re-think.<br><br>The AF1 dismissal process didn't really help with this -- my AF list just kept growing and growing.  As time went on, the number of open tasks never really went down.  I did lots of work, got lots of things done, but couldn't keep up with all the new things I needed to do.  AF4 helped with that a little, but every time I started a new "closed list" it was longer than the previous one -- and never shorter than 5 or 6 pages.  <br><br>The DWM "space invaders" marching forward every day really helps me see how much is on my plate and how much I have over-committed -- in this way, DWM is very much like DIT but much more flexible.  Also, seeing what kinds of things are expiring and thinking about why, is giving me lots of ideas for improving my systems for handling my work, not just re-thinking my commitments.  <br><br>Anyway, that's how it's working for me, and it's great!</div>
