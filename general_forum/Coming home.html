<div class="content">I have just come back to visit this site after an absence of a few months.  And look what's happened while I was away... smoke and mirrors!<br><br>For me, reading Do It Tomorrow, and doing my (limited) best to apply what I learned, was a significant step forward in my journey.<br><br>But now, this Auto Focus bizzo, which I have started implementing for, oh, let's see now, about 30 hours, feels like another breakthrough.<br><br>But here's the thing... I have always been a pretty intuitive person, and trusted my intuition what's more.  And a lot of what is involved with the practice of the Auto Focus approach, seems a lot like what I normally do anyway, even within the DIT framework... scan through the 'to do' list, and do what hits me.<br><br>What's different, is the simple but powerful, and in some ways quite subtle, addition of a structure around that process, in such a way that the structure is not constricting.<br><br>Plus a further clarification of separating out tasks from appointments.<br><br>So I am looking forward to pursuing this.  Thank you to all those who have written recently to this forum, as I have already learned from you.<br><br>And a special thank you to Mark for being such a personable fellow. :-)<br><br>By the way, Mark, off on a tangent I would be interested in exploring one day whether the AF approach is more applicable to certain personality types.<br><br>Regards<br>Steve</div>
