<div class="content">How many pages do people have using AF2 compared to AF?<br><br>And what happens with AF2 if frankly you don't care if things get dismissed? Its not that these jobs don't need doing (book plumber, tidy pantry etc) its just I would rather not do them. I am not sure why but with AF I felt more like I would do them and frequently did. <br><br>I woke up today to find potting shed sort, seed sort, spare room plan and strim garden marked for dismissal. I almost jumped for joy. I think with AF I would have chipped away at part of 1 at least, so it would have got re-entered. As it is its gone. Yeah! I know they are not gone gone, and the strimming will certainly need doing. But dumping tasks seems great for me. It helps ease my procrastination, mostly as the list gets shorter even without doing much. Or am I missing something here?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Amber<br><br>I kind of agree although maybe for different reasons.  As time goes on and my list continues to grow, it's becoming harder to care enough about the 'on notice' tasks so as to go through all the other tasks in order to reach them.  I'm feeling less empowered and more than a little overwhelmed.<br><br>Maybe it's also some sort of (irrational brain?) reaction against being told (if only by the system) that a task will be dismissed. In AF1, I decided to dismiss something by not doing any work on it.  Maybe I felt more in control of that process. Maybe I'm just having a bad day..<br><br>Andy</div>

<div class="content">I dismissed quite a few in AF. Not as many as I did. But this is partly as I counted dismissing an item as doing it. As the system didn't care if it I did and crossed it out or dismissed it. It was off the system, and there was one less item in there. <br><br>Done items are highlighted in pink and dismissed have a black cross next to them. I would say that most pages are mostly pink. The pages that were a lot of dismissed were pages where I dumped ideas - and in GTD they would have gone into @ someday maybe. So they were no loss. Also I know dismiss is not lost. Its still there. I still have the notebook, just as I have my daily notebook going back for the last few years. <br><br>And I think that any system has to say you have a set amount of time (days never get longer!) so there will always be that limit to your work. Lists are always longer then the time you have. So roll on the dumping!<br><br>But I have to say with AF2 I never read the whole list back. Whats the point?  If item number 1 stands out I should do it. If it doesn't I move on, surely?<br><br>Anyhow chopping my lists smaller sounds great. Now if I could hide out in bed for a week then call plumber will be gone too!<br><br>p.s not sure I understood Franks post ;-)</div>
