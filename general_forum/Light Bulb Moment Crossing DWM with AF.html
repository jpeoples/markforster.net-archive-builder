<div class="content">First some history...I started with DWM on day one and the first week was easy.  Once things started advancing by the week, it got ugly and I went back to A4 for a while bcause I just couldn't keep up and the tasks on the chopping block just couldn't be dismissed.  DWM is intriguing but I just couldn't make it work at first.<br><br>Now with the one month mark looming on the horizon, I was reviewing my tasks (still had several in toodledo from my first crack at DWM) and I think I had a bit of an "Aha" moment.  When a project became active (meaning I grabbed it from it's one-month entry point and began working on it), I tended to start dumping any/all tasks related to the project into the calendar pages as they occurred to me.  <br><br>What I didn't like was now I had a task at the one-week mark and then several other tasks scattered at 1+ month for the same project.  The other problem I foresee is that now several tasks coming up for dismissal on Tuesday are related to a client project and not dismissible.  We had a technical glitch that is causing a slight delay and those tasks can't even be started until the problem is fixed.  The project itself is moving forward as we are working through the glitch, but those 8 or so tasks will have to wait.<br><br>So last night, as I was trying to reconcile my A4 success with DWM, it dawned on me that what I should be putting in DWM is simply a bookmark for the project, not all the project pieces.  So I think I have now come up with a DWM/AF hybrid of sorts.<br><br>Projects get entered alongside single tasks in the DWM notebook.  (I use toodledo because it's easy to move things forward without rewriting and I can set active projects to repeat every 7days when I check them off to keep things moving automatically.  It's also portable!)  Whenever I scan my list, I am now looking at my projects list in dated order instead of a bunch of random tasks.  It's easier for me to think about which project I want to work on rather than minute pieces of the project.  I pick a project to work on and from there, I use AF to work through the project.  I have a page per project in my circa notebook (and in some cases I have a note attached to the toodledo task if the list is short) which lists all the little actions associated with each project.  I work on the project tasks AF-style for as long as I need to and then go back to the DWM list and check off the project so it moves forward one week.  <br><br>I've only been doing this for a day, but I really like it so far.  It feels organized for me and I feel like I'm making progress on everything.  I like seeing my projects in dated order and reshuffling each time I work on them.  It also gives me a good sense of how many projects I am juggling.<br><br>Just thought this idea might help others struggling with this type of situation.<br><br>For anyone who remembers the GTD-Palm days, this is reminiscent of the PigPog method. ;)</div>

<div class="content">Exactly as I have described my Toodledo implementation ... which reflects my paper implementation which is pretty much how I did it in all of the AF systems ... and all other past systems as well.  IOW, I never thought it made sense to put small related tasks in to the "system".  You put the project in and then go to the project list to see what has to be done.</div>

<div class="content">I think this is brilliant.  I have been using something like Autofocus as a nonlinear project planner for a few years - the big difference between the mine and AF was that my cutoff line was each milestone.  My initial mindmap becomes the first AF list - and one of the first steps is organizing the list into milestones.  I kept trying to make this work for daily tasks and it never did.  Another issue with this was 6-7 lists to manage to figure out what I needed to do.  Also, I lump documentation/tutorials across projects, so that was a problem.  And, it didn't take into account email, talking with everyone in the office, etc.<br><br>Adding DWM in to this I have make headway on my key goals for the quarter (and therefore year) in addition to daily/repeat tasks.  It handles both well.  Higher priority projects can get more "play" on the Day/Week/Month schedule simply by adding them in more times on the list.  This seems to work well for me - the more times it's on the list, the more important it is.  Works better than highlighting or something else.  I also feel like I did a lot of work on X if i mark it off 6 times for the day.  :)<br><br>Thank you for your comment!</div>
