<div class="content">I'd imagine theres a niche for being able to curate ideas, tools, etc and design a workflow system, customized for an individual's needs. Have any of you seen anything like this? <br><br>The key would be to identify critical variables that would inform the methods and tools. And then once the psychology bit has been taken care of, it's a matter of borrowing ideas from Forster, Allen, etc., etc., and creating something that appeals to the emotional touchstones of each individual.<br><br>Clearly this is something I have tried to do in my own life -  though I imagine I'm too close to my own work and style to be effective. <br><br>What critical factors would need to be considered if one were to customize a system for somebody else?</div>
