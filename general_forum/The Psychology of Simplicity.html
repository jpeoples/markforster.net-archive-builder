<div class="content">The human brain doesn’t like to deal with a lot of stuff at the same time. That’s why most questionnaires ask you to scale things from one to five. It’s why the 12-tone diatonic scale consists of only seven lettered notes. It’s why you read off credit card numbers in groups of four. It’s why, when you want to go out for dinner, you first ask yourself, “Do I want Thai or Mexican,” before you ask yourself, “Which Thai restaurant do I want to go to.”<br><br>We naturally tend to abstract things into more general terms—as in the restaurant example—to limit our choices and avoid overwhelming our brains with complexity. Mark’s AutoFocus systems simply help us do this by breaking our tasks into four groups: new, backlog, discarded, and deleted, thus focusing our minds on a single group at a time and limiting our choices. You could also say that the closed lists (consisting of a single page) do the same… limit our choices. Matt’s flags do the same. DWM does the same. 3T does the same. Project pages do the same. They all simplify the long list by abstracting into groups and limit our choices to a manageable number. This is a good thing.<br><br>But what’s really going on? What is our intuition telling us? What are these generalized groups really about? In my mind, I see it as “what needs to be done”, “what should be done”, and “what I’d like to get done” … all of which is viewed from the prospective of “what am I able to do”. Personally, I still get overwhelmed with what needs to be done, so I also have a group of “what I am currently working on” (3T).<br><br>Different people’s brains can manage lists of different lengths. That’s why my “in progress” list has five or six instead of just three. That’s why Matt uses 25 flags while 3T only gives you three and BryanR’s intuitive flagging gives him 10-15. That’s why some people put projects on separate lists while others just throw everything into a single list. That’s why different systems appeal to different people.<br><br>The AF systems are also helping us put our tasks into the appropriate categories. The dismissal rules help us identify the things that we really feel are just “like to get done” stuff. The approaching deadlines of DWM help us move stuff to the “what needs to be done” group. Matt’s flags show him the “need to get done” stuff.<br><br>I don’t know that this epiphany of mine will help me develop a system that’s perfect for me, nor do I know if my pontification will help anyone else out there. I do feel, though, that I am starting to get a better understanding and I thought I’d share with the group.</div>

<div class="content">Makes sense, and quite possibly this is a useful way to think.  I'd add that it's not only brains but situational differences that are a factor here.</div>

<div class="content">Great post, I think this is why we must first understand ourselves and how we are wired and then look for or develop a system that fits us.<br><br>Gerry</div>
