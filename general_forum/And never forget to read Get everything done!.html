<div class="content">Like others (avrum etc.) who participate in this forum, I also finally decided to buy Mark`s "Do it tomorrow" book, and I also bought and read "Get everything done", which was published even before. As for DIT, it is very good book, full of new insights and tips for me. <br><br>But what I want to share on this forum is my opinion about the other book - "Get everything done". It`s reading was absolutely eye-opening experience for me. I was very surprised, because as a reader of almost all time management books in this Universe, I do not expect any new time management book to be so different or with so big impact on me. Its ideas not only deeply resonated with what I have been thinking for long time already (although not being able to put it explicitly), but I also realized that these described principles are much more important than any single "technique" which can stem from them. And what I especially appreciate is that Mark himself says in the book that we may even change our techniques from day to day (based on our confidence to master the tasks or on our moods), that we can overgrow them etc. I like this dynamic approach very much.<br><br>I also think that this book (at least for me) has been a little bit overshadowed by newer approaches like FV, AF etc on this forum. So by this comment I want to emphasize that it is really golden nugget among time management literature. If you want to improve yourself in this area and have not read the book, I honestly recommend it to everybody. Maybe...you can still catch up as a Christmas present :-)</div>

<div class="content">Isn't diversity a wonderful thing? I got so much more out of DIT than GED. But I agree that everyone should read them both.</div>

<div class="content">I discovered Mark Forster through this book quite some years ago, before DIT was published. It was different from most time management books I'd been reading up to that time. I found it quite refreshing, and I can recommend it to anyone interested in the subject.<br><br>I liked it enough to make me go out and buy the Dreams book. I was less convinced by that one, even though it has some fine ideas (the "what's better" list among them). I also subscribed to Mark's newsletter and bought DIT when it first came out. In my opinion, DIT is his best book yet. That is, until he decides to put his recent thinking that led to AF, SF and FV into a new book....</div>

<div class="content">What I especially liked about GED book was the fact that it is (in great part) about PRINCIPLES. Through them I have now much better understanding of TECHNIQUES (incl. newer ones - FV, SF...) which Mark published later and it also changed my thinking about time management quite a bit.</div>
