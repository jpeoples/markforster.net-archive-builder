<div class="content">Hello Mark,<br><br>Thank you so much for the book. I reread it again, and am applying things I missed the first time. I have not seen productivity like this...ever!!<br><br>One issue I have is how to keep pace on the Will Do List, without having any tension. When I see my list at the beginning of the day, I get this tension to rabidly finish everything as soon as possible.<br><br>Especially things that can't be done until later in the day, keep bothering me as well for some reason, just seeing it on the list. <br><br>Wondering if that's just me or if anyone else has similar issues and how the handle it.</div>

<div class="content">KS - I know what you mean!  Maybe it's to do with how one thinks of DIT and therefore the lists it generates?  If it's viewed as just another thing to do then it causes unnecessary stress; if it's viewed as a helpful, useful tool, then it's less stressful.  Chicken and egg maybe, but it may all come down to how useful you find the system?!<br><br>A</div>

<div class="content">There is a relatively new book out called, Just Enough Anxiety, with a subtitle the Hidden predictor of success.  This relates to the primitive brain and the rational brain along with techniques to better manage the balance in order to succeed.<br><br>Anyway, I had just finished From Good to Great, and their description of a Level 5 leader, Hedgehog concept, "Crawl, walk, run", etc. seemed to coincide with principles from both Mark's book  and the book mentioned above.<br><br>have fun,<br><br>Bob</div>

<div class="content">KS<br>I'm not at all sure that feeling tension to get the list completed is a bad thing! In fact what I suggest you do is view the tension as positive energy which is enabling you to get the work completed with the minimum of distraction.<br>Mark</div>
