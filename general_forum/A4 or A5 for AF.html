<div class="content">I'm still debating whether to use A4 or A5 for my main Autofocus workbook.  I wonder if any of you could let me know the pros and cons you have come across.  Tomorrow is the big day (Sunday) - I have most of the day to myself and whilst I have some work I have promised to do, I have the time to sit down and sort out all my tasks and get this ball rolling - I've thought about it enough now and want to get cracking on it.</div>

<div class="content">For AF4 the size of a notebook does not matter much, I think, as there are no page bound boundaries to the method.  I  prefer in that case the smallest model A5 as it does not eat up to much desk real estate.</div>
