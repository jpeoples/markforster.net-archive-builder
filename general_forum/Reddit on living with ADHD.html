<div class="content"><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/16joxj/people_with_adhd_what_adhd_is_like_how_does/c7wnp37" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/16joxj/people_with_adhd_what_adhd_is_like_how_does/c7wnp37</a><br><br>Occasionally, reddit discussions come up with some really amazing stuff.  The link above describes what it's like to have ADHD, and the ensuing discussion keys on ways to cope or even thrive.  I don't have ADHD, though I definitely have tendencies in that direction.  I found the discussion useful.  Quoting below one person's contribution to the discussion.<br><br>"What I do is try to jot down things I need to get done, but that I don't want to do, and also things I want to do, so I don't forget. I stop occasionally, lunch time or first thing in the morning when I'm fresh, pick the mundane stuff I don't want to do from the list and challenge myself to get it done as quickly as possible. I make it a game for myself. Our reward receptors still work like everyone else's so use whatever makes you happy. Once you knock out the stuff you don't want to do literally give yourself a cookie, or a soda, or whatever…. <br><br>This has resulted in a marked increase in my productivity, to the point it often surpasses my coworkers."</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the link Alan. <br><br>It's very easy to create a simple 'system' (I know...we love our systems here) from this excellent paragraph, for example, <br><br>Need to do - but don't want to!<br><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>Want to do - so don't forget!<br><br><br>- All the stuff you need to do goes above the line. All the stuff you want to do goes under it. This can be done on any old scrap of paper. <br><br>It also appears that this format can be 'scaled' very well on 1 piece of paper, e.g. need to do & want to do THIS WEEK, THIS MONTH, THIS YEAR etc. Personally I might just use one other timescale with it i.e. THIS MONTH</div>

<div class="content">You forgot the cookie, Leon.  It's the most important element of this system.</div>
