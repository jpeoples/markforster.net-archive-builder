<div class="content">How does one handle waiting for items in Super Focus?  As a web developer, I constantly pass things off to my graphic designer and must wait for her response before I can move the project forward.  <br><br>Does this require a separate "waiting for" list or do I just note that I am waiting for her response in column one of the last active page?<br><br>In the case of the latter, what happens if that's the only task left and I feel it's too soon to follow up?  Let's say I give her a week to revise a comp and that task is now the only one remaining on the page 3 days after I added it. How is this handled?</div>

<div class="content">I put things like that on my calendar as a tickler and then move it back to the list (i'm actually using AF4 (maybe Af1, I'm not sure) but it sounds like it would work similarly with SF too.</div>

<div class="content">In addition to using a calendar if you want to use the list my method is to use a W next to items.  So if I have a task call Joe, if I get his voicemail, I would put a W next to it to note I made the call and am waiting for a return call.  This method cuts down on re-writing.  The other way is to put the reminder in the list, like, Ask Joe about the timing of the report.  Your mind will usually know when it is time for another reminder.  Good luck <br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">drummergirl:<br><br>I put "waiting for" tasks in the list with a query after them, e..g. "Bob replied re Project X?"<br><br>Since it's a question, if it's the only task on the page I can answer "No" and re-enter it on the last page. Or more likely enter "Chase Bob re Project X"!<br><br>However for a period of a week or more, I would usually use an Outlook reminder or similar, rather than leave it on the list.</div>

<div class="content">I asked nearly the exact same question here: <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1360168" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1360168</a> . I don't know how to link to the individual reply, but Matt's (2mc) response (the second response in the thread) helped me tremendously. Basically, I add the date that I last took action and the number of times that I've taken action to the task description. I can then add a reminder to my calendar to follow up with that person. In my notes, I have a log of the date for every time I'm asked for a follow-up.<br><br>Example:<br>(4 - 2011-02-18) Charlie Brown - Build QS/1 Interface, Due: 2011-02-25</div>
