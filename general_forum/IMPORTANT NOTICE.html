<div class="content">Because spam is becoming a major problem on this discussion group, I have decided to make it membership only. This will not cost anything, but means that you must register before you can use the site, and will have to sign on when you want to make a posting.<br><br>If you wish to register for the site, please email me at mf@markforster.net with the following details:<br><br>1) Account login name (alphanumeric characters only - minimum 4)<br><br>2) Display Name (the name you wish your postings to be displayed under - may contain spaces)<br><br>3) Password (6-25 characters)<br><br>I recommend if you were previously a frequent poster to the site that you use the same Display Name to ensure continuity.</div>

<div class="content">Could we use a captcha system instead to prevent spam? Does SquareSpace offer this facility?</div>

<div class="meta">2010-11-7 11:04</div>
<div class="content">No, it doesn't at present. But, even if it did, captcha systems are far from infallible. <br><br>No spam at all has so far got through this site's new system of registering for the Forum and moderation of the Blog comments</div>

<div class="content">Captcha is really a pain: you have to enter it for each post you want to make.<br>Login is the best thing that happened to this website...<br>Apart from the contributions of the users of course ;)</div>

<div class="content">Yes, Erik, but we are missing the contributions of all the people who are resistant to registering on websites.<br><br>I would be interested to know by how much the rate of newcomers has declined.</div>

<div class="content">Laurence:<br><br>There are now 82 members, which means that 12 have joined since November 2nd when I last posted the number of members, a rate of just under two new members a day.<br><br>I don't know what the rate of newcomers was before the registering was introduced, but I do know that nearly all comments came from people who were either regular posters or spammers.</div>

<div class="content">I hope this site continues to get an ever wider readership because of its great content. Maybe there is a way of charting the web traffic and seeing it visually, perhaps something to come back to in a few months.</div>
