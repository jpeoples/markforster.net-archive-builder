<div class="content">Mark says that the five tasks that you initially write down can be large or small, but you should be clear as to what counts as finished. One thing that has only lately become clear to me is that initially I had been writing what the _next five_ things were to be. These could be small things, and they could be things that really should be counted as parts of my daily routine. So they could be fiddly little things that would happen anyway. <br><br>That's not wrong, but it would mean that I was consulting the list very frequently and not finding much exciting on it.<br><br>By contrast, the best result of thinking hard for a few minutes about what's most valuable to do in the day, or rest of the day, is a number of important things to be accomplished. (Of course, where you're committed to some large project, you have to specify some suitable subgoal for the day, as Mark explains.) <br><br>Now that I've grasped this difference, my 5T list is a more interesting place to visit.</div>

<div class="content">Chris,<br><br>Yes. I think of my 5T list as a list of things to accomplish.<br><br>"Today, I accomplished lunch and feeding the cats - unusually productive..."<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Will</div>

<div class="content">Ideally the five tasks should be a mixture of large and small tasks. By large I mean ones which will take several sessions to complete and by small I mean ones which can be done in one go. So you might be working on two major projects while simultaneously processing a whole raft of small but necessary tasks.<br><br>I don't specify it in the book, but it's a good idea to start the day with the biggest challenge of the day as the first task.</div>
