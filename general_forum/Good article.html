<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2014-08-29 0:52</div>
<div class="content">I admired the article at <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/08/the-most-productive-people-know-who-to-ignore/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/08/the-most-productive-people-know-who-to-ignore/</a> , particularly :<br><br>"Here’s the problem. After we prioritize, we act as though everything merits our time and attention, and we’ll get to the less-important items “later.” But later never really arrives. The list remains without end. ...<br><br>The first step is to reframe the issue. Viewing a full inbox, unfinished to-do lists, and a line of disappointed people at the door as a sign of our failure is profoundly unhelpful. This perspective may motivate us to work harder in the hopes of someday achieving victory, but this is futile. We will never win these battles, not in any meaningful sense, because at a certain point in our careers the potential demands facing us will always outstrip our capacity, no matter how much effort we dedicate to work. So the inbox, the list, the line at the door are in fact signs of success, evidence that people want our time and attention. And ultimate victory lies not in winning tactical battles but in winning the war: Not an empty inbox, but an inbox emptied of all truly important messages. Not a completed to-do list, but a list with all truly important items scratched off. Not the absence of a line at our door, but a line with no truly important people remaining in it."<br><br>[Link amended so it works - MF]</div>

<div class="content">A lot of what he says is exactly what I've been saying for years. I don't agree with his solutions though. Read my new book when it comes out!</div>
