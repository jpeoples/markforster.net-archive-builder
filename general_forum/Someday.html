<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>In Autofocus, how do you handle someday items. Do you include them in your normal list, or do you keep them on a separate list. I looked through the forum but did not find a conclusive answer.<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>DKD</div>

<div class="content">I just add them to the list. If they are the last item on a page and I don't want to do them yet, I'll just dismiss them. At a later point in time I'll review my dismissed tasks, so for all intents and purposes, they will form my someday/maybe list.</div>

<div class="content">DKD:<br><br>"Someday items" is a GTD concept not an Autofocus one, and it's always a bit dangerous importing the concepts of one system into another.<br><br>Basically my advice is that you shouldn't try to dredge up every possible thing that you could, should or might do. <br><br>Instead start from scratch and let your list grow organically. By that I mean you add things as you think of them or as they come up. That way the list remains live and relevant.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>Thanks for that answer. That's what I needed.<br><br>Andreas, thanks for you suggestion as well. That's how I will handle the existing someday items on my lists.<br><br>DKD</div>
