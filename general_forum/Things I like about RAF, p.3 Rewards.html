<div class="content">The best thing about working with lists is of course the rewarding moments they provide. <br><br>Crossing of items! Marking a page as “done”! Striking-trough, erasing, highlighting, ticking-off, counting the points! <br><br>It’s like when that unwelcome guest leaves already and you can close the door behind them!<br><br>Beeing the king in your own little economy of endeavour and self-chastisment.<br><br>I don’t know it RAF is the best system in respect to those rewards, but it is pretty good an I like it a lot!<br><br>First, everyday when you prolong the line to close the DDD-list, you will see if you even have to go through a DDD-routine today. If not, this is (likely) because you worked well the day before. You could clear everything so no left-overs behind the line. <br><br>This means, RAF has the potential to start the day with a big reward for you! <br><br>The "at gun-point" operation as previously mentioned is completely optional, it largely depends on whether you wrote down too mayn pipe-dreams or worked too slowly. If you worked well, it leaves you alone.<br><br>In any case, there is this inbuilt goal, that is motivating all the way of working the list well, so that the DDD moment will be shorter.<br><br>When you finish for the day, you draw the short line.<br><br>This means, now you have time to play. I like this clear-cut division of labour and play and I like that it is based on the list and not some more arbitrary value like for example what the clock says.<br><br>So everyday there is this structure of when you finished DDD, when you finished work. While the list is not a closed-list, it still has this feature of the cloesed-list, which is so popular with DIT. <br><br>Because it closes the day for you, because you close the list.<br><br>The pages are ordered. With some Autofocus lists you have some early pages still active while at the same time a pretty recent page is already done. The pages spread problem.<br><br>This bothered me, not only because it can slow down your traversal through the lists, but also because I want to enjoy the haptic experience that using a well manufactured notebook provides. With RAF it is a nice wandering through the notebook, page by page, as you leave the finished pages behind you to never to return.<br><br>In order to avoid a too long DDD the next day, you are motivated to work on the oldest tasks first, but without a rigid rule that created problems with the “hotties” at the end of the list.<br><br>Even the scheduled items that come back to the list can act as a reward. If the schedule is done well, they come at roughly the right moment to inspire and instigate creativity!<br><br>(Instead of overwhelming a catch-all list into unmanageable size or breaking a GTD system to the point were a dedicated app can’t even sort it out.)<br><br>What other rewards using RAF can you think of?</div>
