<h1>Yahoogroup for Spread of Autofocus?</h1>

<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-07-29 9:49</div>
<div class="content">I'm so excited about the new version of Autofocus that I believe everyone should hear about it. With that in mind, I'm wondering if anyone would be interested in joining a discussion group (probably on Yahoogroups) which would be about spreading the word about AF. <br><br>What it would NOT be about is discussing how AF works - this forum and other existing groups do that job admirably already.<br><br>One caveat: the total amount of money I have made out of all the versions of Autofocus so far is precisely zero. I do intend to make some money out of it now and, although the main aim of the group will be to discuss ways of making the free instructions for AF as well-known as possible, there will inevitably be an overlap with my business activities.<br><br>If sufficient interest is shown in this idea, I'll set the group up as soon as possible.</div>

<div class="content">Isn't there a yahoogroup already? Not that we can't have two, but just need to be careful to avoid confusing people.<br><br>Other ideas for getting the message out:<br><br>- Get a manifesto out on <a href="http://www.changethis.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.changethis.com/</a><br>- get to professional bodies and trade associations. I remember a great evening at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (a phrase you don't hear often enough!) - if you could follow that up with a link on their website...<br>- but before getting links in, spruce up the site a bit. In particular, update the AF instructions and provide a clear landing page for people to link to. <br>- unleash the Tribe on Twitter and Facebook (with some clear messages. We are unusually nice people, but as bishop Butler, I think, said," enthusiasm is a horrid thing")<br>- Get to the productivity gurus like Michael Mann, David Seah, Leo Babauta, Michael Bungay Stanier who are not directly affiliated to a rival process such as GTD</div>

<div class="content">Will:<br><br>Thanks for the suggestions.<br><br>The AF yahoogroup is about how to do AF, not about how to spread AF which is what I'm proposing.<br><br>The sort of things which you have put in your post are exactly the sort of things which we would discuss on the group.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>If it makes sense to set up a new group, then my all means.  You have posted on Mel's group before (   <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AutoFocusTM/" rel="nofollow">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AutoFocusTM/</a>  ) so maybe that would work?  If there needs to be a small change in focus, I'm sure Mel will be happy to support that.  The group has been pretty quite so far so it is not as if you'd be disrupting anything ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Mark - whatever you do, you need to focus on the "gut feeling"/intuition aspect of your system. IMHO, the problem with your first splash on lifehacker, was an oversimplification of your system. As such, most folks poo poo'ed it as another "to do" list. <br><br>Try to connect with authors who promote intuition as an effective means to get stuff done. I'm thinking of Blink, The Artists Way etc.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark<br>I don't know what exactly I could contribute, but I'm willing to help in any way that I can.  Although I'm not an AF'er or RAF'er, I certainly appreciate the fact that it tremendously helped thousands of people.  You are indeed deserving of your proper due.<br>re: business advice from me........don't take it!  I've had several works stolen over the years.....the worst.......I contracted a goldsmith from a very prominent jewelry chain to create my art into a gold, diamonds and saphire amulet.  Sunday's Washington post had a full page ad with my design on it with a hefty price tag attached!  (I had it made as a personal gift.......Apparently, it was a gift that kept on giving to those greedy bas*****!<br>It wasn't the money....it was the theft!   In the art world, we kick back a percentage to the actual creator......their excuse, I should have copywrighted the drawing!  <br>I have a few other examples.......in short, it's happened more than once!  And I'm talking HUGE money in one case.....Grrrrrrr<br>But I'll be a willing mule if you need those types of efforts!  Business sense: marketing, drawing up contracts, etc...?  Never did I fool with that again....I learned to hire out for that stuff!!!!!   Even so, I want to contribute......your book, blog posts, and discussion forums has been above measurable value!  THANK YOU!<br>Learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>Carole King once said that she didn't even dare to hum her tunes within earchot of anybody until they were copywrighted!  LOL!<br>Another warning: don't EVER forget to sign your artwork.......You might recognize it in a book or journal with someone else's signature!  I did artwork for others for their credit and got paid for it..........but I detested when opportunistic peers "lifted" it without my prior consent!  <br>Another warning: don't start submitting work on ANY ghostwriting jobs BEFORE a contract is signed.<br>I'm the poster child of naive, bad business practices!  *blush*<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Mark, the group is indeed quiet and you could certainly ask that group if they would be interested in your new focus. If they want the focus the same, you would need a new group. That is, unless getting the word out would be more of a short-term emphasis. All of that to say that despite my being the list group owner, I want the group to serve your purposes.</div>

<div class="content">Regarding the existing group, I think part of the original intention was to open the discussion up to a wider audience and in a different format than the main forum (here).  <br><br>But I think Mark's new goal is to discuss and strategize how to *create* sites like that.<br><br>I could easily envision that this new proposed Super Hero Strategizers and World Conquerers group, would eventually try, as part of their evangelizing efforts, to create a Yahoo Group to discuss the tool and how to use it.  <br><br>So, if we change the AutoFocusTM group to become the World Conquerers group, here is what would happen:<br>(1) People on that group already who aren't interested in World Conquering would drop off and/or fade away.<br>(2) Eventually the World Conquerers would decide they want a new Yahoo Group as a discussion forum for what AF is, how to use it, and so on; such a forum would help spread the word and perhaps help make Mark some money<br>(3) The World Conquerers would thus create this new Yahoo Group<br>(4) The World Conquerers would need to bring in new people (some of whom perhaps have already left the existing Yahoo Group)<br><br>So, I think this might be more effective:<br>(1) Create a new World Conquerers group on Yahoo - great venue for the discussion.  Plus, Mark could create it himself and be the owner, so he could control access (not sure a group like that would want public access).  He could assign moderators if he wanted.<br>(2) Let the existing AutoFocusTM group continue as is, as a public forum to discuss the benefits and uses of AF<br><br>Anyway, just some ideas, maybe I'm totally missing the point here...  :-)</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br>I think you're right in your analysis. And I really like the title "World Conquerors Group" - I wonder if it's taken - that would presumably make me the Chief World Conqueror.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-07-30 3:34</div>
<div class="content">> that would presumably make me the Chief World Conqueror. <br><br>I think Dick Cheney might have the trademark on that.<br><br>On YahooGroups, AutoFocusTM, AnalogOrg, and do it tomorrow groups are oddly silent. Perhaps everyone has the RAF virus . . .<br><br>I'd second Sraphim's suggestion. <br><br>AF1 really didn't sing for me, but AF2 did and with RAF, I've got a whole chorale going on. I've already started giving away spiral notebooks with the pdf instructions enclosed.</div>

<div class="content">Notebooks with enclosed RAF instructions? Mark, you should do that, not clay  ;-)<br><br>By the way, if you would put together a PDF with the instructions, some samples, some tipps against procrastinating, nothing fancy, just some pages, maybe stuff you wrote in you previous books, i would be happy to pay for it. Not that i need it to understand RAF, but just to give you something back for you giving me the best productivity tool.<br><br>I know it would not make you a fortune (we are not that many here, are we?), but it would give me a good feeling. And it could be the starting point for a new book.<br><br>Again, thank you very, very much!<br></div>
