<div class="content">Before SuperFocus, I often "drew" my to-do lists. The impetus came from <a href="http://todoodlist.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://todoodlist.com/</a>  where I once bought an ebook about "doodling your list." It is basically a "mind map lite" technique for connecting tasks in sequence and annotating them with reminders. I don't follow it to the letter or anything, but I find this sort of doodling helps me get creative about a project.<br><br>Also, doodling can really hit the spot for a to-do list of random items, though at other times a regular linear list feels right too, for whatever reason. Maybe it depends on what I had for breakfast.<br><br>Anyway, it occurs to me: SF could easily be applied to any diagram full of tasks covering a page, whether they all belong to one project (like Mike Brown's idea of project-specific SF lists) or they are on the main list of wide-ranging topics. All we need to know is when the page has "filled up."<br><br>Well, I would say the page is full when you feel resistance to cramming any more doodles onto it. Best to mark it in the corner ("F" perhaps?) when you first feel this resistance, so you don't go back on it later.<br><br>And Column Two? Either keep your doodles to the left half, or use facing pages. Doodle C2 if you like, or leave it in the more businesslike linear form. It is a commitment, after all! ;-><br><br>Voila, SuperFocus for diagrams!<br><br><br>Does anyone else like to doodle / mind-map / flow-chart their projects?<br>Any awesome graphical techniques worth sharing?</div>

<div class="content">At first I thought this wouldn't jive, but this really is a lightbulb of an idea!  Absolutely there is NOTHING about SF that would fail to work if "Column 1" ceased to be a vertical list.  Now I'm having a hard time imagining a use for freestyling your list, but "more fun" might be enough.<br><br>I like drawing goal diagrams, promoted by Barbara Sher.  See page 33 of this pdf: <a href="http://wishcraft.com/wishcraft_ch6.pdf." target="new" rel="nofollow">http://wishcraft.com/wishcraft_ch6.pdf.</a>  Read the whole chapter for instructions on building these.  I do this outside SF.  Not sure what would happen if I tried applying SF rules to it.</div>

<div class="content">You'd have to be careful you are looking at the entire list, and that non-finished items don't have so much happening around them that they look finished.<br><br>One strength of AF and SF is that you look at everything on the list every so often so each item has a chance to grab your attention, or to worm its way into your subconscious so your subconscious can work on it.<br><br>Easy enough to handle if you are aware of the risk. Don't squeeze items into small spaces. Ensure items don't look like doodles. Maybe add a symbol to each task to separate it from random ideas. Maybe divide the page into sections when you look over it so you don't miss anything. Many ways to solve the problem.</div>

<div class="content">Alan, thanks for the link! Looks promising. The biggest things I like about doodled lists are (1) connecting things with arrows/lines, and (2) visual demarcation with colors or differently-styled borders. Really adds value over a linear list. Since items tend to come to mind in batches, my C1 pages typically include half a dozen related items scattered among the one-offs, so I am already tending to draw the interconnection lines & arrows among my linear text.<br><br>Cricket, I definitely know what you mean, so these doodles need just enough structure to convey quick, accurate, visual meaning. This kind of minimal structure is what the "todoodlist" ebook is all about.<br><br>A trick I've developed is to draw a heavily-outlined empty box next to any to-do in my diagram. It denotes an empty checkbox, and I check it off (in a different color) when complete. For example: doodles and words in black ink, check boxes in blue, check marks in red. Then, imagine big, think-y items drawn as clouds, vs. little do-it tasks in rectangles. Just experiment, and you will probably develop your own little "doodle language" pretty quickly.</div>

<div class="content">FYI, to use Alan's link, just backspace that extra period after "pdf." The forum code seems to have mistakenly included it in the link.</div>

<div class="content">I have used mind maps for projects.  I like to put the outcome in the middle and then work outwards toward the edges with the steps that lead to the outcome.  What I also like about mind maps is they allow you to see what needs to be done in sequence as well as what steps are independent.<br><br>Thanks for the links<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">Agreed, Gerry. At a glance, I can see that my page has several separate "clouds," each made up of interconnected things, plus some other singleton items floating about. This conveys a lot of information in one glance, and I cannot duplicate that with a line-by-line list of the same items.</div>
