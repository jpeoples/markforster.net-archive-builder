<div class="content">I wonder if there could not be any alternative about systems. I explain <br><br>(1) In GTD you have to collect everything then claryfy each item and plan the next actipn then organize then review which one is the best at the moment, then at last you do <br><br>(2) In AF system it is the same except that item are collected one by one, mixts and then acted in differents ways<br><br>(3) In no list (if I understood the method) you let you intuition guiding you and collect a few items. Then you act with different systems<br><br>The problem ogf all systems exept the last one with me is that<br><br>(1) In GTD I spend a lot of time thinking but not acting. It makes me a lot of trouble in my work which is founded on action and reacting activities. Its encourage procrastrination<br><br>(2) In AF systems I feel overwhelmed and lost in front of the very big mass of stuff. Sometime my AF / FV list was about 9 or 12 pages. <br><br>(3) I have no idea of the results of the no list because I did not try it. <br><br>here is my idea <br><br>1) Make a series of objectives (goals) ie what I want to get in certain time (one week or one month or one year) and how I will get them <br><br>2) Make a sheet (word file ?) of each objective. Detailled and sort them by urgency and importance. (Eisenhower A, B, C, D) <br><br>(3) Plan each objective each month, each week, each day on my diary and control them regularly.<br><br>(4) During the day follow each objective and adapt them acording to the opportunities of life. <br>Do Tasks as I feel regarding to the final objective<br><br>(5) Make a single someday may be list which are stuff I want or may do eventually just to remember. <br><br>What do you think about this ? I you tried this ? Thanks for your ideas and commentaries. <br><br>Kind regards.</div>

<div class="content">I did that on steroids with a grid.<br><br>https://cricketb.wordpress.com/2013/09/06/new-time-management-tool-milestone-chart-with-long-term-planning/<br><br>Each column is a project or context, things that are done one after the other.<br><br>Each row is a date.<br><br>Cells then have deadlines or milestones or tasks or time estimates. I didn't fill in every cell.<br><br>One row would mean a year if it was far away, and a single day if it was really close. And a month or so for middle distance.<br><br>A quick glance would tell me that I had three big projects due the end of June. I had to do much of the work in early June, or plan for a nervous breakdown in late June. (This annoyed my coworkers. They had to do their work before I could start mine, but they wanted to wait until late June. For all three of my projects.)</div>
