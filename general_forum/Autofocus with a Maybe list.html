<div class="content">The "Autofocus" part can be anything.<br><br>I'm sure this has been tried before, and some things were found to work and others weren't.  So I'm asking about any successful system that works vaguely like an Autofocus, but *doesn't* put new ideas onto the List.  Instead, new ideas for things to do that haven't been committed go on a Maybe list, and the Autofocus List consists of <br><br>Committed Task<br>Committed Task<br>Check Maybe List.<br>Commited Task<br>etc.</div>

<div class="content">I need to keep everything in one list. My tasks and needed outcomes come in bursts and I do not know which of them will be important so I'll leave myself an option to commit easily to any of them. But I need to filter what is possible to do or what I want to do in near future  from the rest of items.<br><br>My main list is a ’Capture All’ with a ”Committed To” twist.  The twist is made by adding to the end of the line either  an asterisk (= Committed To) or a slash (= Committed Tentatively). <br><br>I tend to choose intuitively tasks from the Committed To subgroup but I choose also other tasks from the rest of the list. <br><br>This twist works well probably because there is focus but there isn’t so much focus that the rest is ignored.<br><br>Also when I see clearly what I'm committed to do/get done  I have found it easier to delete items from the list.</div>

<div class="content">I think my list is similar to pkNystrom's without the formal markings.  I capture everything in one list because I know I'll never check another list.  I need the simplicity.<br><br>But I think my differentiation between committed, tentative, and maybe is just done in the unintentional way I word things and the fact that I don't mind just crossing something off if I just change my mind about it or it's become obsolete.</div>

<div class="content">I put one-off tasks into Outlook Tasks, and assign the "someday-maybes" to low priority.   I scan them from time to time, generally when I am tired at looking at the other tasks or just wonder what kind of stuff I put on the low-priority list.</div>
