<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-08-1 20:13</div>
<div class="content">Hi All. I have been reading many of the posts on this forum for some time (since mid-May), but have not posted til now. I have used AF1, still my favorite of the 3, and tried AF2 for a while, which had its merits. Since said merits of both systems have been greatly discussed on this forum, I will not go there in this post. It’s the combo, RAF, that I wanted to comment on.<br><br>I found it to be overwhelming and well, I think the simplicity of AF1 in particular has gotten lost. I know many had various issues with it (AF1), and hence tweaked here and there to accommodate their own particular situation. I gained value and some good tricks from said tweaks that I have used to gain even more out of AF1 (loved the condensed AF1). But, alas, this new version feels cumbersome and even awkward. I really do not mean to sound critical as I think the foundations of AF are brilliant, and I love it. I am looking at it more from the viewpoint of getting it out into the World. <br><br>**Sharing with others?<br>Here’s another way of explaining this. When I came across AF1, I couldn’t wait to tell a couple people about it (both I believe are still using it at least to some degree, tho not sure how “pure”). When AF2 came out, I thought it had some good features, tried them myself, but didn’t feel as compelled to share it. (I love to turn others onto new things I feel have value for whatever reason, so it was “noted” that I didn’t share AF2). <br><br>When RAF came along, I realized I had NO pull to share it at all. It just feels to confusing, unless, perhaps, one has been down the AF1 to AF2 path. I am not looking at this from the viewpoint as my own particular situation (i.e. amount of discretionary time, procrastination level/issues, etc.), but rather from the vantage of sharing the system with others, or perhaps how a newbie might view RAF. It doesn’t have a comfortable, I can do this! feel to it.<br><br>My hope here is to offer up an opinion that may ultimately help the success of the system, as I feel it has an amazing premise. I personally feel the brilliance is (was?) in its simplicity in both use and explanation. This would apply to either AF1 or 2. <br><br>**The RAF flowchart<br>A comment about the flowchart: it does explain RAF. So good job for sure. But the very fact that it NEEDS such a complex thing is my very point, really. Again, a “newbie” may well look at that and go “Clearly, I need to take the course to implement this system…”. <br><br>**No negative comments really a good thing??<br>Lastly, I wonder if the reason there haven’t been comments about tweaks or even “negative” ones is because for those who know AF in all its variations RAF may well make sense, but it may be that it has left some in the dust…those who don’t devote as much time to this forum or AF in general. I am wondering if others may agree?<br><br>**Question to the regulars on this forum<br>>are you feeling compelled to share this new version of AF? If so, how has that gone? Do others get it easily? In order for this to become a true success for Mark and a viable TM system, this seems like a good question to ask/ponder. Comments? <br><br>**Does AF want to become a book?<br>Could it be that this is really, a book (or ebook) and not a simple one or two page system with a flow chart? And is that so bad? Certainly seems to me that there are other things to expound on wrt to AF. Some ideas for chapters (just off the top of my head):<br><br>~using both sides of the brain to determine priorities and actions<br>~how to use both logic and intuition to your advantage<br>~AF tackles the age-old  nemesis of so many: procrastination<br>~AF1 if you are______<br>~AF2 if you are______<br>~RAF if you are______<br> And I’m sure there are other potential chapters here!! <br><br>Ok, sorry for going on here…love to read your thoughts.</div>

<div class="content">Mh, now that you mention it, I introduced AF1 to several people, gave the translated rules of AF2 to one of them (he stayed with AF1), and I didn't share RAF with anyone. I don't feel that compelled to do so, too. Mhm ...</div>

<div class="content">You're right. But this may prove to be a financial advantage for Mark. Obviously if GTD could be explained in 30 seconds, it wouldn't be the gold mine it is for David Allen. I do believe that the various modes of AF appeal to different people. Even some of the other intermediate tweaks with their proponents could be profiled in the book (e.g., condensed AF).</div>

<div class="content">I really can't speak to the share or not share aspect yet. But, I do have  some thoughts about the perceived escalating complexity of AF1, AF2, and now AF (I am using Mr. Forster's terminology for the current system. . . it is simply Autofocus I beleive).<br><br>It doesn't seem to me that AF is any more complex than AF1 or AF2. . . the only addition is that it has a couple of rules regarding switching between them. Similarly, AF1 and AF2 don't seem that divergent in complexity either. In fact, I think one could argue that, if anything, AF1 is the MORE complex between AF1 and AF2 (look at how simple and short AF2 rules are!).<br><br>So what's going on? Why the perceived increase in complexity?<br><br>Here's my theory: I think AF2 seems more complex than AF1 and AF seems more complex than either because I don't feel that the *reasoning* behind the rules have been elucidated as in depth as with AF1. But, I might be wrong about that since I'm a newcomer.<br><br>Perhaps if we understood *why* the rules say what they say then we would feel them to be simpler? Perhaps an "a-ha!" moment? And then let the mission-work begin!<br><br>I'd like to hear your thoughts.<br>--Joseph</div>

<div class="content">>> Why the perceived increase in complexity?<br><br>Oddly enough, it was the perceived simplicity of AF1 that created so many negative comments on lifehacker. Perhaps the perceived complexity of the combo will be well received by the geeks that visit (I'm one of 'em) lifehacker.</div>

<div class="content">My feeling is that to even understand RAF, you had to go through its development process - that is, you had to start with AF1, stumble across its problems with urgent tasks, had to try out AF2... You have to be part of this group here, in other words. For someone who is totally new to this approach, it would be maybee too big a jump.<br><br>I am sad to say I feel the same as Beth. AF1 had this "cut the Gordian knot" appeal, this "Heureka!" feeling, a certain "Wow!"-effect. In comparison, RAF is "yet another system".</div>
<h2>Reply by Mike</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-08-2 14:26</div>
<div class="content">Andreas,<br><br>Exactly.  Thus my suggestion to explain only the basics of AF1 to someone and see how it goes.  Then give them some of the more detailed info about dismissal and readding and how other problems they encounter might be handled.  Then, if it seems warranted, introduce the AF2 idea of working backward.  Finally, once they seem in control of that, give them the final bit about the switching and they know as much as we do.<br><br>It is not as if I feel that people can not understand RAF -- just that it has that feature to it that it does not make sense until done.  Even AF1 was that way.  With RAF I can see them rolling their eyes and walking off muttering to themselves about geeks and To Do lists.  Once they try AF1, they'll get how it changes them and be ready to put in effort to learn more.  Just my thoughts this morning ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Let's keep things in perspective.  To learn GTD, you have to read a book or attend a weekend seminar, and then it takes at least a year to attain "black-belt" status, to say nothing of the elusive mind like water.  To learn RAF, you read three or four pages and practice for a week or two.<br><br>(I like the RAF acronym with its hint of the Royal Air Force.  Per ardua ad astra! (RAF motto).)<br><br>I should add that I am a former GTDer who spent uncounted hours collecting, processing, organizing, and reviewing, and precious little time actually Getting Things Done.  I remember having an entire weekend to get going with an important task, and not being able even to get started on it.  With AF you just sit down and go to work, without, so far as I can see, having to sacrifice any of the advantages of GTD.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-08-2 20:22</div>
<div class="content">Perhaps a key here is this: Before trying out something new, like a TM system, one wants to KNOW WHY it works (which requires explanation) and/or want to SEE WHY it works (which requires use). With AF1 it was pretty easy to get up and running with some simple explanations (hey—if it can be explained over a beer!!). So, without much ado a “user” can begin to experience the value, thus SEEING it firsthand.<br><br>With RAF there is quite a bit more explanation needed. Hence, a longer learning curve, and so the perceived or potential value may not be as readily apparent. This is fine if the explanations are clear and in a format that is accessible and usable, and all that goes with that is in place (i.e. marketing, attainable formats, etc.). <br><br>Which opens the door, imo, to the fact that AF has evolved into a bona fide TM system, one that may well have extensive applications and would very likely appeal to a broader public *if the system was explained in fuller terms*. Including, as someone else pointed out, the WHY it works is more fully explained. <br><br>And in fact, this may be a real key here. Mark has come up with such an innovative approach/idea* for TM and productivity that it really is a system warranting further explanation. (*Idea being how to use both intuition and reason in the managing and deciding of how to use one’s time, not to over simplify here).<br><br>To revisit my original query re: sharing RAF. I can now see that it really isn’t about how easy it is share, but more about that AF in all its forms are “worthy” of greater explanation and exploration. And I, for one, would love to see the eBook!! (Btw, I have thought of several additional chapters and topics since my original post!).<br> <br>Again, I am looking at this from the viewpoint of appealing to a wider public, those who have not gone through the growing and evolving stages of AF.</div>

But if one ignores the nonsense, the basic ideas are pretty simple.  As to how long it takes to be a "black belt" ... balderdash.  I did not even think in those terms.  It is just a way of doing things and the concept of "black belt" is just downright silly.<br><br>Finally, "mind like water" ... again, more balderdash ... a mind like water is a condition to be treated, IMO.

<div class="content">Regardless of the balderdashivity  of GTD terms like "black belt" and "mind like water" -- those are the very terms David Allen uses when describing his system.  And he also has said repeatedly that it takes about 2 years to really become efficient with GTD, to make it second nature.  <br><br>I totally agree that RAF, while a bit more complex than AF1 or AF2, is FAR simpler than GTD.  And really, I don't think RAF is that much more complicated than AF1 or AF2 to get started.  You still just get a notebook and a pen, and get going.  Mark's got the "start up" instructions all spelled out.  It might take a couple days to really get used to the flow, and maybe a couple weeks to really start cranking.  But there have already been newbie testimonies of how it's made them more productive the very first day, so I don't see this as an issue.<br><br>Has there EVER been a GTD claim like that (going from zero to big productivity gains on the very first day)?  Again, David Allen himself says it usually takes anywhere from half a day to several days just to "sort out one's stuff", pile everything into appropriate collection receptacles, start processing, and coming up with "next actions" for all your "open loops".  For myself, I devoted a Thanksgiving Weekend (4 days) to get started with GTD way back when, and NEVER really found myself "cranking" with it.  (Though it still had some helpful ideas.)  <br><br>With RAF, you can really start getting going within minutes, and see very significant productivity improvements within DAYS, not weeks, months, or years.<br><br>More articles, books, ebooks, training, and so on can certainly be enlightening.  Understanding how the psychology of the system works is also very helpful.  It can give you more confidence and help you understand the WHY.  But still, JUST GETTING STARTED is so easy, and it's so low risk (you didn't invest hours or days re-inventing your "system", and really don't need to throw anything away if you quit AF).  You will really learn more by GETTING STARTED than by anything else, I think the instructions are just fine as they are, and can be shared just as they are.  <br><br>The only reason I haven't done that yet myself, is that I've been really busy with many other urgent things, and "Write about RAF on internal blog" just hasn't had time to "feel ready to be done" yet.  And other opportunities to present the system just haven't appeared yet.  (I suppose I'm more of an opportunist than a marketer when it comes to promoting these things).

<div class="content">Good Morning Seraphim,<br><br>>>>  Regardless of the balderdashivity of GTD terms like "black belt" and "mind like water" -- those are the very terms David Allen uses when describing his system.  <<<<br><br>I think that reflects an "efficiency" rather than "effectiveness" way of looking at things.  Personally, I really don't want to become hyper-efficient doing what does not need to be done.<br><br>As to "mind like water", again I think this reflects a preoccupation with issues surrounding mental tranquility.  If one wants tranquility, then sitting in daily meditation is more likely to get one there than sorting through multiple context lists.<br><br>There is much about the writings of David Allen that reflects his own personal goals and struggles.  Mark, not so much, it seems.<br><br>>>> And he also has said repeatedly that it takes about 2 years to really become efficient with GTD, to make it second nature.  <<<<br><br>That all comes down to how you define "efficient".  It probably takes the same amount of time to reach the same goal using any system … it is just a question of defining the goal.  AF deals only with managing a task list effectively -- so it is up and running in minutes and I don't know how long it takes to become perfect at it … whatever that means.  The entirety of David Allen's prescription for living life probably DOES take multiple years  -- if you even wanted to do it!<br><br>>>>  I totally agree that RAF, while a bit more complex than AF1 or AF2, is FAR simpler than GTD.  <<<<br><br>I would agree that AF, in all versions is simpler than  GtD.  HOWEVER, let's be clear about what GtD really is.  When DA wrote his book, he assumed that the reader's life was chaos.  So he described how to make a big pile out of everything and sort through it.  Is that GtD?  No, that is a prerequisite to managing one's chaotic life under any system, if one's life is in chaos.  Likewise, his advice on how to file papers is HIS advice … it is not GtD.  It would be absurd to say that unless I used an electric labeler and eschewed hanging folders I was not using GtD.<br><br>The ESSENCE of GtD is:<br><br>- Define a single Next Action for any project<br>- Put it on an appropriate context list<br>- Decide what context you are in<br>- Do the Next Actions that appear on the list for that context <br><br>The rest is just good advice which applies to any system:<br><br>- Define goals<br>- File papers<br>- Keep on top of incoming items<br>- Write things down<br>- Keep a calendar<br><br>One could add to any system:<br><br>- Eat right<br>- Drink lots of water<br>- Exercise<br>- Etc.<br><br>AF would not argue with any of that … but the difference is that Mark does not go into all of that when he writes about AF.  So to compare GtD with all of the baggage added to the essentials is not enlightening, IMO.<br><br>>>> And really, I don't think RAF is that much more complicated than AF1 or AF2 to get started. You still just get a notebook and a pen, and get going. Mark's got the "start up" instructions all spelled out. It might take a couple days to really get used to the flow, and maybe a couple weeks to really start cranking. But there have already been newbie testimonies of how it's made them more productive the very first day, so I don't see this as an issue.  <<<<br><br>All I'm saying is that if one has a filing system, a calendar, has an inbox, etc. then defining next actions and putting them on a context list is just as simple.  Now I disagree with that way of doing things … I also contend that there is some confusion involved in the idea of contexts, and that they are not very useful for some of us.  But there is not a lot of inherent complexity involved in putting things on lists.  Is it MORE complex?  Yes.  It has multiple lists and decisions about those lists.  Is the complexity enough to make it take years to help?  No chance.<br><br>>>>  Has there EVER been a GTD claim like that (going from zero to big productivity gains on the very first day)?  <<<<br><br>It seems to me that I've seen such testimony.  And I've even believed some of it ;-)<br><br>>>>  Again, David Allen himself says it usually takes anywhere from half a day to several days just to "sort out one's stuff", pile everything into appropriate collection receptacles, start processing, and coming up with "next actions" for all your "open loops".<br><br>Yes, but that is not GtD.  And if one needs to "sort out one's stuff", one needs to do that no matter what one does with one's To Do list.  If one does not, then it is just a question of making the lists.<br><br>>>>  For myself, I devoted a Thanksgiving Weekend (4 days) to get started with GTD way back when, and NEVER really found myself "cranking" with it. (Though it still had some helpful ideas.) <<<<br><br>My experience was slightly different.  I did not need to sort things out.  I was reasonably sorted out ;-)  I spent a long while struggling with context lists and never did get the hang of it.  I don't think it is a very useful concept.  But then, that's me ;-)  But within a few hours I had a fist full of context lists and was cranking.  But I did not like the rattle the crank was making ;-)<br><br>>>>  With RAF, you can really start getting going within minutes, and see very significant productivity improvements within DAYS, not weeks, months, or years.  <<<<br><br>I think the same is true of basic GtD.  I think if I had the kind of mind or context that worked well with GtD, I'd still be doing it.  I have some problems with AF as well.  It works so much better for me, but it still has its problems in my life.  The difference is that it is easier to tweak AF than GtD.  If you go from multiple context lists to a single list … you no longer have the essence of what GtD is.  With AF, I can change exactly how I implement a dismissal rule but it remains essentially AF, IMO.<br><br>FWIW, I see the essence of AF as being:<br><br>- Write tasks on a list<br>- Go through the list items in order<br>- Do those that stand out<br>- Dismiss those that you don't do<br><br>How you exactly define each of those things alters it slightly, but all versions of AF (so far ;-) have those things in common.  The difference between Mark and David is that Mark focuses only on the essentials.  While lately he is given to talking about world domination, he does not drag that into the description of his system ;-) ;-)<br><br>>>>  More articles, books, ebooks, training, and so on can certainly be enlightening.

I disagree that if I want to share the system it would be so easy any more.  I could just say: "Go to the web site and figure it out, that's what I did."  But if I had to EXPLAIN it, I'd be more at a loss with RAF than I was with AF1 … and even with AF1, I'd have trouble explaining it all in one sitting.  (Well, at least I'd not want to do it.  I mean, who wants to haggle with terms like "dismissal" when you have to DO it in order to get it?)<br><br>>>>  The only reason I haven't done that yet myself, is that I've been really busy with many other urgent things, and "Write about RAF on internal blog" just hasn't had time to "feel ready to be done" yet.

<div class="content">Hi Mike,<br><br>I think the differences between RAF and GTD are more fundamental than that.  It's not that Mark just focuses on the essentials, and David Allen elaborates more.  David Allen also claims to focus on the essentials -- he repeats that quote from Einstein, "Make things as simple as possible, but no simpler".  The problem is that David Allen's approach requires an entire book just to explain it, where RAF just takes a few pages.<br><br>I could go into more detail on that, but I want to keep the discussion pertinent to the subject of the thread:  how hard is it to get started, how hard is it to share with someone else.<br><br>In David Allen's GTD chapter on "Getting Started", he states right up front:  "I recommend that you create a block of time to initialize this process and prepare a workstation with the appropriate space, furniture, and tools...  An ideal time frame for most people is two whole days, back to back...  The ideal time for me to work with a professional is on a weekend or holiday because the chance of outside disturbance is minimal then...  It takes a lot of psychic energy to collect and process such a large inventory of open loops, especially when they've been 'open', 'undecided', or 'stuck' for way too long..."<br><br>He then goes on for 15 pages on how to set up your space, detailing lists of tools you might need, emphasizing the importance of a good filing system, and so on.<br><br>Sure, those things are helpful, and if you have a good workspace and good filing systems, it will help you with RAF too.  <br><br>But back to the main point -- whether getting started with RAF or GTD is "low risk" or "high risk".  NONE of those set-up details are prerequisites for getting started with RAF.  Your filing system can be a disaster, but RAF will help you sort that all out.  GTD requires that you've ALREADY got a pretty good handle on it.  <br><br>GTD requires you to do a complete inventory of your "open loops" ahead of time.  RAF lets you take it a piece at a time.<br><br>GTD really does require that you at least read the book.  Probably twice.  And then block out some time to get started.  And make sure you are really ready to get started.<br><br>RAF just requires you read a few pages of instructions, pick up a notebook and pen, write down whatever tasks are on your mind, and start working.  The rest grows organically.<br><br>Then, backing out:  let's say it doesn't work for you.  With GTD, you've already invested so much, maybe even lost a whole weekend trying to get started, spent money on new filing cabinets or whatever, it feels like such a waste when you back out.  Sure, maybe you have a better idea what's on your plate, maybe you took the time to create a better filing system, and so on.  And you can keep those things going forward.  But in the end, there sure was a lot of "sound and fury, signifying nothing".  <br><br>With RAF, if it doesn't work, you can just stop.  No big loss.<br><br>The very low risk of giving RAF a try is a very big selling point, I think.  It makes it much easier to share with other people who may have never even been interested in "time management" before.<br><br>>>> Oh, I'm just thinking about explaining it to my wife or someone. Who's got time to fuss with changing the world? LOL ;-) <<<<br><br>:-) <br><br>AF is the very first system I've ever even considered sharing with my wife -- at the very least, just showing her how I use it myself.  I've also shared it with my two oldest kids.  And discussed it with my co-workers.  And whenever I happen to see someone reading a TM book, like Stephen Covey or David Allen, I mention RAF to them.  <br><br>Most of the time, I don't get any real response, no real interest.  And I think that's because most people are happy with whatever ad-hoc system they are using for managing their workload.  <br><br>But sometimes, I get answers like, "Wow, that's exactly what I've been looking for!  Thanks so much for sharing!"  and   "My dad taught me something very similar, and I've always done it that way, but now I have a place to direct people when they ask me how I stay so productive!"   Things like that.   <br><br>With GTD or Stephen Covey, the answers were usually blank stares, or sometimes, "I admire that you're able to stay on top of that, I always tried but just couldn't keep it up"  or  "Yeah, I liked the four quadrant idea, but the rest seemed like too much work", etc.<br><br>AF and now RAF are totally different.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Beth,<br><br>I think to have that "eureka!" feeling with a time management system, it has to address an individual's personal circumstances / time management sticking points.  Some people have issues with having to deal with urgent items (AF2), some with overwhelm or procrastination on non-urgent projects (this was/is me and AF1 was wonderful for this).   And I think RAF deals with urgent items too, but I'm not sure what other common time management eureka-style issue it addresses.  Other than that, I can't comment because I floundered with RAF and decided this weekend to cut my losses - I'm back to AF condensed (with a little added tweak) and AF1.  <br></div>

<div class="content">Hey Seraphim,<br><br>>>>  I think the differences between RAF and GTD are more fundamental than that. It's not that Mark just focuses on the essentials, and David Allen elaborates more. David Allen also claims to focus on the essentials -- he repeats that quote from Einstein, "Make things as simple as possible, but no simpler". The problem is that David Allen's approach requires an entire book just to explain it, where RAF just takes a few pages.  <<<<br><br>Yes, DA "claims" to stick to essentials.  The test is to analyze his system and see if he does.  We have both noted that he does not, I believe.  I mean, Hitler said he wanted peace with Poland and yet …  LOL ;-)<br><br>And I reiterate, his approach is more than time management.  It is a whole life restructuring.<br><br>>>>  In David Allen's GTD chapter on "Getting Started", he states right up front: "I recommend that you create a block of time to initialize this process and prepare a workstation with the appropriate space, furniture, and tools... An ideal time frame for most people is two whole days, back to back... The ideal time for me to work with a professional is on a weekend or holiday because the chance of outside disturbance is minimal then... It takes a lot of psychic energy to collect and process such a large inventory of open loops, especially when they've been 'open', 'undecided', or 'stuck' for way too long..."<br><br>He then goes on for 15 pages on how to set up your space, detailing lists of tools you might need, emphasizing the importance of a good filing system, and so on.  <<<<br><br>Yes, but once more … that is not the "system" … it is his vision of how everyone should behave in life!  ;-)<br><br>>>>  Sure, those things are helpful, and if you have a good workspace and good filing systems, it will help you with RAF too.  <<<<br><br>Exactly.  One thing we need to do is wash out what is common between RAF and GTD to find out what is essentially different.<br><br>>>>  But back to the main point -- whether getting started with RAF or GTD is "low risk" or "high risk".  <<<<br><br>I thought our point was about ease of explanation, not risk!<br><br>>>>   NONE of those set-up details are prerequisites for getting started with RAF. Your filing system can be a disaster, but RAF will help you sort that all out. GTD requires that you've ALREADY got a pretty good handle on it.  <<<<br><br>Well, that is in some sense true.  But one can do GtD with messy files.  You'll just have DA "tisking" at you ;-)<br><br>>>>  GTD requires you to do a complete inventory of your "open loops" ahead of time. RAF lets you take it a piece at a time.  <<<<br><br>I guess I did not see that as an essential part of the system either.  It is certainly a good thing (though the name is pretty awful and again, unnecessarily metaphorical).  One can start the GtD system, where one is, with only a few slips of paper to hold next actions on context lists and be off and running.  As things come up, they can be sorted onto those lists.  I may be sounding like I'm being the devil's advocate here, but I do think entirely too much is made of the complete life revision which accompanies DA's description of GtD.  Lots of good ideas, some not so good, and certainly not all of them necessary.<br><br>>>>  GTD really does require that you at least read the book. Probably twice. And then block out some time to get started. And make sure you are really ready to get started.  <<<<br><br>I had not thought about the "reading the book" aspect.  I did read the book, but I found much of it beside the point and skipped merrily over those sections.  I can explain GtD to a person in just as short a time as I can AF1.<br><br>>>>  RAF just requires you read a few pages of instructions, pick up a notebook and pen, write down whatever tasks are on your mind, and start working. The rest grows organically.  <<<<br><br>Yes, that is true.  I've not disagreed with you on that.  I've mostly disagreed that I can EXPLAIN it in a few minutes.  I also think that a lot of questions arise … and we see that from the activity on this forum.<br><br>>>> Then, backing out: let's say it doesn't work for you. With GTD, you've already invested so much, maybe even lost a whole weekend trying to get started, spent money on new filing cabinets or whatever, it feels like such a waste when you back out. Sure, maybe you have a better idea what's on your plate, maybe you took the time to create a better filing system, and so on. And you can keep those things going forward. But in the end, there sure was a lot of "sound and fury, signifying nothing".  <<<<br><br>There is that sense to it, but, as you say, nothing was lost if you want to buy a big ole Stephen Covey binder from Franklin and implement that system.  Or even AF!<br><br>I think the big "loss" would be if you set up a system that left you in a lurch and you started missing things when you tried to stop.  I don't think that is the case with most systems.<br><br><<<  With RAF, if it doesn't work, you can just stop. No big loss.  <<<<br><br>And with GtD you are left with project files and multiple context lists.  You'd not lose anything, you'd just have to reformat.  But that is the same with RAF.  If you went from RAF to GtD, you'd have to analyze your list and sort it all out into context lists.  In a way, it would be easier to go from GtD to RAF … you'd just copy all of your lists into a book and you'd be off and running.  Which speaks volumes about the ease of use of RAF.<br><br>>>>  The very low risk of giving RAF a try is a very big selling point, I think. It makes it much easier to share with other people who may have never even been interested in "time management" before.  <<<<br><br>Yes, I think that is one of the greatest selling points.<br><br>>>> Oh, I'm just thinking about explaining it to my wife or someone. Who's got time to fuss with changing the world? LOL ;-) <<<<br><br>:-) <br><br>>>>  AF is the very first system I've ever even considered sharing with my wife -- at the very least, just showing her how I use it myself. I've also shared it with my two oldest kids. And discussed it with my co-workers. And whenever I happen to see someone reading a TM book, like Stephen Covey or David Allen, I mention RAF to them. <br><br>Most of the time, I don't get any real response, no real interest. And I think that's because most people are happy with whatever ad-hoc system they are using for managing their workload. <<<<br><br>I think that is probably so.  My understanding that time management systems are personal has led me to not try to "sell" mine.<br><br>>>> But sometimes, I get answers like, "Wow, that's exactly what I've been looking for! Thanks so much for sharing!" and "My dad taught me something very similar, and I've always done it that way, but now I have a place to direct people when they ask me how I stay so productive!" Things like that. <br><br>With GTD or Stephen Covey, the answers were usually blank stares, or sometimes, "I admire that you're able to stay on top of that, I always tried but just couldn't keep it up" or "Yeah, I liked the four quadrant idea, but the rest seemed like too much work", etc.  <<<<br><br>Yes, there is a certain overhead to both Covey and GtD that scares people off.  It was the overhead problem that drove me away from both of them.  (And I don't mean the dreaded review … which I do anyway.)<br><br>Just to be sure I'm understood clearly:<br><br>- I like AF, in all of its incarnations,<br>- I don't like GtD<br>- I would not bother explaining any system to someone else ... I'd point them to the books/instructions and just tell them it works for me<br>- I see no cost to anyone trying AF<br>- I see no cost to anyone trying GtD or Covey ... providing you ditch what is just tree trimming and keep the tree.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">The success of GTD is a constant mystery to me.  Perhaps it appeals to IT folk which would explain why there is so much on the internet about it.  <br><br>In my quest to sort out my time management problems I went to Boston twice to hear David Allen explain his system.  I have used the system for some time but gave it up because in practice it didn't help.  Here's what went wrong....<br><br>1. I found myself overwhelmed with next actions which lead to procrastination.<br><br>2. I used to provide transaction support in an M&A environment and when you had a couple of deals on work could flood in.  GTD offered nothing over a list on a bit of paper.  I always think the test of a time management system is when under heavy fire.  It's ironic that this is the time you need a system most and most systems breakdown.<br><br>3. If you don't use the GTD system for a couple of days it goes stale meaning the up-front investment in getting all the next actions captured is lost.<br><br>4. Generally most bosses/clients etc expect small easy things to be done immediately not get parked on a list.<br><br>5. The system fails most (per David Allen) because the weekly review doesn't take place - yet another investment in time to keep the system running.<br><br>I'll stick my neck out and make a prediction.  I think GTD will go the way of space hoppers, callanetics etc.  Huge for a decade and then nowhere.<br><br>Whilst I am in dissing mode I also have never understood the success/longevity of the 7 habits either.</div>

<div class="content">I agree with Mike.  GTD and AF can be regarded as complementary.  <br><br>There is absolutely nothing contradictory about either of them.<br><br>AF picks up where GDT leaves off.  AF helps you to manage your to do list in a way that works.  When systems do not work for us I think it is usually because when we come to the crunch point of actually "doing" things we stumble.  GDT simply says "use your intuition and you will choose things and do them."  Mark realizes that it is not as simple as this and he gives us a system that helps us at the very point where we tend to stumble.<br><br>So I say that AF is the missing piece in the jigsaw of GTD.  I have streamlined GTD to suit me (as DA would encourage me to do).  Then with AF added, the system is complete.</div>

<div class="content">AF and GTD are so different because they are for different people with different problems. <br><br>AF is for a lazy person. They have no energy. Their problem is procrastination. They are just not doing anything productive. AF helps them to do overcome procrastination and start working.<br><br>GTD is for an industrial person. Managers etc. They have no problem with procrastination. They are full of energy and are already working all day through. Their problem is that they are juggling with too many balls and some of the balls get dropped. GTD helps them to sort it out, by keeping an eye on every project.<br><br>In other words, GTD helps industrial people manage projects, AF helps lazy people manage themselves.<br><br>About comparizon of AF1,AF2 and RAF. RAF compensate drawbacks  of AF1(delay of urgent items) and of AF2(delay of important items), but for the price of complexity. Which is a shame. A lazy person can handle ony very simple, low-overhead, low-learning-curve systems. So simplifying of RAF would make it more useful for the target audience.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Jim: I don't agree that AF helps managing GTD lists. I always had problems defining next actions as needed for GTD, as many of my projects mainly consist of thinking - which isn't a physical action and should be done front up before writing down the next action (I don't think I have to explain the results ...). With AF, I just write down a keyword I have to think about.</div>

<div class="content">@kiwiserg:<br><br>I agree with your description.  I am a 'lazy' person - that is, I am not lazy once I start doing something, but I will find any excuse to delay starting it.  GTD was no help at all.  I liked sorting everything so that it was allocated to a context/project/status and going through my lists to make sure they were organized right.  But that was where it stopped. <br><br>There are other people, here and elsewhere, who don't have that problem, but are coping with much larger workloads than I have to deal with.  They need the 'industrial' approach - a good word for it - I always felt that David Allen's ideas were based on the factory system, breaking every job down into stages with different parts of the brain being treated like individual workers on a production line! <br><br>Even with AF, whether 1, 2 or R, I find it difficult to do anything.  I certainly don't have the great experience of increased productivity that others have talked about.  I miss the feeling of having everything laid out where I can see it, as in GTD, but it is much easier to do something off the AF list,  strike it through, re-add and so keep plodding along.</div>

<div class="content">Hi kiwiserg<br><br>Wow - that's a pretty sweeping generalisation!!  As someone with a major issue with procrastination who loves AF but had run my own business for many years, I would expect that my staff may well have found my procrastination irritating but I would be surprised if they ever felt I was lazy!  on the contrary I was more likely to be busy - just not necessarily making the best use of my time.  I think someone who procrastinates may well think that they must be lazy but there is a MASSIVE difference between the two.<br><br>If someone is inherently lazy they will be unlikely to care about Time Management anyway.  Procrastinators on the other hand are desperate to do things and to make the best use of their time.<br><br>As a procrastinator I can definately see the appeal of GTD - it has a great appeal to the procrastinator's overwhelming desire for order;  the concept of having a defined list for everything, everything neatly set out and structured, a system to follow sounds fantastic.  The problem for the procrastinator is that they will throw themselves into it with great enthusiasm, spend days setting it up and then ............ discover that they don't actually want to do anything.  The weekly reviews become a chore - are procrastinated on - and you are back to square 1 with little more than a lot of lists and a sense of failure.<br><br>I do believe that GTD has a place though and will be of immense benefit - but to those who don't have a problem with procrastination.  Those who are able to be organised "naturally" will greatly benefit by the addition of such a system of order and will undoubtedly naturally fit their reviews in with little or no effort.  However everyone is not the same and for those of us who do struggle with procrastination, a system such a GTD - whilst having immense appeal - just causes more problems.  I have no doubt whatsoever that many of the ideas and concepts of GTD can be incorporated - primarily more on the project management front than on the TM front - but AF provides a totally different approach and virtually eliminates the guilt and sense of frustration and failure that many long term procrastinators have lived with.<br><br>I do feel it is important to differentiate between "laziness" and "procrastination" and when you say that "A lazy person can handle ony very simple, low-overhead, low-learning-curve systems" I think that is basically not correct.  A genuinely lazy person would probably be unwilling to be bothered with any system whatsoever whereas the procrastinator thrives on complexity.  Far from only being able to handle one simple thing at a time the problem is far better identified as being able to handle many areas of complexity at any given time but not necessarily making the time to action what is "right" at any given point in time.  That is where AF scores - it identifies that finding what is "right" is actually already known by our intuition and provides the framework to learn to recognise that fact.  That is the key - intuition and learning to trust it rather than just focussing on the urgent or unimportant.</div>

How could you possibly object to that advice? <br><br>GDT recognizes the futility of such items as "take weight off" as a task for your list.  It suggests that "ring my dietician" would be a more helpful springboard to making progress.  Or, if you prefer, "think about my weight and write out a diet plan".   <br><br>I have to say that I never write down a task unless I have determined what I want to "do".

<div class="content">@Jim: The more I read about GTD, the more I got the impression that the next action list should contain only physical actions - and stuff like "decide a or b" doesn't count as physical.<br><br>Many of my actions lie somewhere between "Clean kitchen" and "conquer the world" (nearer to "Clean kitchen, usually ;-) ), many of the important ones are similar to "think about x until you know what to do" - and it can take days or months until I come up with the one idea I really like. During this time, I don't do anything visible. But if I don't have a reminder, I just forget about it.<br><br>I know it's important to have more or less specific tasks, but for me, there's a big difference between specific and physical.</div>

It's not frustrating at all.  In fact, it's liberating.  It allows me to write down an idea, a general of interest to explore further, a general concern about something that needs to be done.  And importantly, it allows me to write those things down, without forcing me to come up with a concrete "next action".  I can write down whatever comes to mind.<br><br>When I come to those items and I feel they are ready to be done, perhaps that just means giving it a few moments' thought and determining what to do next.  Maybe it means breaking it down further into different areas to explore.  Maybe it means rewriting the task completely.  Or deleting it.<br><br>The beauty of AF's way of handling this is that I can deal with it WHEN I feel ready and HOW I feel it is needed.  The system isn't forcing me into the little box of "next actions".</div>

<div class="content">I agree with kiwiserg that someone that's a little bit more lazy will be more inclined towards a simpler system.  A lazy person is almost always looking for the way to get things done without actually putting too much effort (mental or physical) into it.  <br><br>I think that lazy people naturally have a very well attuned intuitive system because most have lived their whole lives just doing what has to get done and no more so they are always scanning for what doesn't seem like too much work to do or what's actually enjoyable - and it's a lot easier to do anything when you've got a bit of motivation.  A lazy person usually won't have a lot of angst, resistance and anxiety built up over things they haven't done like someone who procrastinates - and anxiety blocks intuition.<br><br>With AF1 then, the lazy person can dismiss easily because it gives them a permission slip not to do something - and what a relief that is!  However, the person who procrastinates will agonize over that - and usually find ways to procrastinate about dismissing. :-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi acedia, <br><br>Thanks - *blush* - oh, I've wanted to say that!  <br><br>The logic behind where I was coming from is that I was looking at all of these books on the craft of writing that I have on my list to read.  Then I started to think "Why are they there?  What purpose do they serve?"  My answer was "to learn more about how to write well".  But I already own and have read what I think are a couple of the definitive books on writing, so my focus should no longer be on learning (as a form of procrastination), but in doing.  <br><br>Part of my motivation for this "less-doing" is that I feel that it's too easy for the day to day trivia of life to get in the way of what we really want to do with our lives.<br><br>Mark said in one of his quotes:  <br><br>"What you haven't done is the price you paid for what you have done. Was it worth the price?"<br><br>Was the task "taking in the recycling" worth the consulting income I could have earned in that same period of time?  No.  I wouldn't have paid someone that amount to take in my recycling for me.   Was it worth the 1000 words I could have written on my novel in that time?  Hell no.<br><br>So why do we choose these mundane things to do either more frequently than we need to do them, or at all for that matter, over going for something more meaningful?  I think part of it is that they're not challenging, therefore easier, that we think we "should" and that we don't *think* period.  I still haven't quite found the trick to getting those "big rocks" into the jar of AF and just letting the sand fill around them rather than letting the sand of the mundane overflow the jar.  Maybe that answer is scheduling and letting AF fill the gaps, I don't know.<br><br>I also find it maddening that I seem to be very adept at pre-filtering what I'm going to do at work with respect to high-value tasks, yet outside of work that ability flies out the window.  <br><br>There was an article in Fast Company that I read years ago and found online by Jim Collins (Good to Great) - here's an excerpt from that article:<br><br>Disciplined action: The “stop doing” list <br><br>Take a look at your desk. If you’re like most hard-charging leaders, you’ve got a well-articulated to-do list. Now take another look: Where’s your stop-doing list? We've all been told that leaders make things happen—and that's true: Pushing that flywheel takes a lot of concerted effort. But it’s also true that good-to-great leaders distinguish themselves by their unyielding discipline to stop doing anything and everything that doesn't fit tightly within their Hedgehog Concept. <br><br>The real path to greatness, it turns out, requires simplicity and diligence. It requires clarity, not instant illumination. It demands each of us to focus on what is vital—and to eliminate all of the extraneous distractions. <br><br>After five years of research, I’m absolutely convinced that if we just focus our attention on the right things—and stop doing the senseless things that consume so much time and energy—we can create a powerful Flywheel Effect without increasing the number of hours we work. <br><br>I’m also convinced that the good-to-great findings apply broadly—not just to CEOs but also to you and me in whatever work we’re engaged in, including the work of our own lives."<br><br>Here's the article link if anyone's interested:<br><a href="http://www.jimcollins.com/article_topics/articles/good-to-great.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.jimcollins.com/article_topics/articles/good-to-great.html</a><br><br>I found Richard Koch had the same kind of philosophy in his 80/20 books (which I got a lot out of in theory), but I never felt the lightbulb go on in how to implement them - apart from scheduling.  It always seems to come down to scheduling.<br></div>

I realized how stupid I sounded without her saying a word. "My mom gave me this. I should read it."  I wonder if the same approach would work wonders with an AF list. Tell someone who knows you well what you are trying to accomplish (write a book, less web surfing etc.) then read the list to them and justify the tasks. You could unload a bunch like I did with books. And just as I told myself with books, you can always add it again later if need be.<br><br>Your solution of more scheduling sounds so good to me in theory, but in practice it breaks down. I think if we give ourselves permission to read writing books rather than write, we will eventually tire of it and get writing. The guilt of doing the unacceptable seems to drive procrastination, at least for me. Getting tough with myself sounds good but never works long-term. <br><br>In the same way that asking why you want to fo something works, so does asking why not. Ask yourself or tell someone else why you don't want to write. Are you afraid you won't write well or well enough for your standards? Are you afraid you'll leave everything else aside as you write? Are you afraid you'll decide you really don't like writing? Have you given yourself too big a task? Could you write a 500 word short story first? FWIW, reading writing books can be very motivational. It isn't just for technique. <br><br>Wishing you well...</div>

<div class="content">Hey Mel, <br><br>Oh boy, I am the worst thread hi-jacker ever - sorry Beth et al.<br><br>I know my m.o. - and that's researching something to death rather than actually doing it - then it seems like all of the excitement and energy is exhausted in the research.  I'm much better off with "ready-fire-aim" or I get locked in analysis paralysis (which leads to self-doubt and depression).  Really, there's very little on my list that I don't want to do or to "have done".  My issue is that I feel I'm taking so much time from my kids in all the other things I'm doing and writing seems like just one more thing that's stealing my focus away from them.   I can get them to help me do the other things, but writing is the selfish thing that's just for me.<br><br>But then there's that Carl Jung saying:<br>"Nothing has a stronger influence psychologically on their environment, and especially on their children, than the unlived lives of the parents."<br><br>At least I'm not hoarding the writing books - they're from the library!  :-)  Actually, they were easy to dismiss - a quick 3 minute skim and into the library bag - buh bye.  I do go on autopilot to do things though.  But that's part of the beauty of AF to me.  I think if you don't have too much emotion tied up in doing a task, it can be a very good thing.  Come to the next page, pick the thing that stands out - it's just a task, no better or worse really than sitting in a chair doing nothing.  It's when we invest things with some kind of *story* that they become things to avoid.<br><br>I've come to what I think might be the solution.  I'm going to modify my AF condensed list to contain: (1) 3 things I can do before work (1 goal / 2 maintenance oriented); (2) 5 things I can do at work (3 goal / 2 life maintenance oriented) and (3) 2 or 3 things for each of my major goals for the month - to be done after work - spending as long as I feel like but for at least an hour.  Of course I won't get them all done, but that's part of the beauty of AF condensed - it doesn't matter.  Then AF1 or RAF until I feel like quitting for the night.  The two systems work very well together, so I'm embarrassed I didn't think of this before now.<br><br>The greatest benefit that AFC gives me is the opportunity to re-write my list daily in a way that the tasks really resonate and makes me want to do those things.  It also lets me work according to the weather and my energy levels (aka pet exhaustion).  And structured procrastination will make the wheat goals separate from the chaff goals - ie. the "shoulds" from the "want to's" in a very clear way - I hope anyway.  <br><br>I'm so excited to try this out tomorrow!  :-)<br><br>Oh also Mel, I had a look at Nick Daws' writing program which you recommended.  Do you think it's a good program for fiction?  I read one of his novels and wasn't impressed but like the thought of being able to write/plot etc. in those 5 minute blocks of time.  I recently found out that P.D. James writes non-sequentially (ie. by what she's inspired to write) and she's one of my writing heroines, so I'm OK with that concept now.  She wrote her early novels with 2 kids and a husband in an insane asylum - at least I don't have the latter.  And the fall semester is coming up at the uni where I work, so I'm thinking of registering for a creative writing course.<br></div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline I am so glad you're excited! I am writing on my phone so please forgive my phone's mispellings. Lol <br><br>I am looking forward to hearing about your new approach. As for kid guilt I totally get that. I have it a lot. As I have shared before I wrote my book at night. It was summer when my dh wasn't working so he got up with the kids while I slept in. I had no guilt and motivation to spare. The motivation was a spiritual thing though with no reproduction rules. Lol<br><br>I am playing tennis this weekend and I am working on my serve in preparation for playing on a league this fall. An instructor once told me that my serve is my strength but the few times I have played since I just wiff the ball. I realized this morning that in tennis as in life I hold back from giving my all in case I still fail. By wiffing the ball I can tell myself that I could be a great player if I really developed my serve. I don't so I can preserve my fantasy of greatness. I am tired of doing this. If I am not a great tennis player or actress or pianist or whatever I still got to experience the thrill of giving it my all. <br><br>I am going to refer to your c list post here too to save iPhone typing time. Lol. It seems to me that rather than dismiss Cs to the drawer, we ought to turn our As as often as possible into Cs. Make your A tasks small enough easy enough or fun enough that you just want to do them. My other problem with priority assignment is it is so changeable. If I am depressed then watching a funny movie with my family may be an A rather than a C. Organizing my photos is a C until my house is on fire and I must grap the most precious memories. Then I see that it was an A task for me. <br><br>I have started to think in terms of 5 years. If I had 5 years to live what would I want to accomplish? Much better time frame for me to think through than 6 months or a year. <br><br>As for Daws' course it has been critiqued as much too simplistic for fiction. I plan to write fiction soon but I have only used it for nonfiction so far. I love it. It's an Af like simplicity for writing. I don't know if you would like it but if you think of it as a nanowrimo like tool for getting you writing you may. Have you read Get Organized Get published? The premise is to write everywhere at all times. Don't wait til you aren't busy. Some of my best stuff has been written on airplanes on a legal pad or at the park while my kids play. Maybe quit trying to be a writer and just enjoy yourself. Before I actually wrote a book the enormity of it paralyzed me. Just make notes on a character. Write notes about a conflict. Get out of bed and write when the idea comes to you. <br><br>One other thing that helped me was taking the pressure off. I met with an agent and had a great response but I was freaked out by the publishing expectations. It wasn't true that I was going to devote my life to promoting my book. Once I decided to self publish and sell at my speaking engagements, I felt freed up to just write. What if you don't get a good publishing contract? Are you still willing to write your book? If so the floodgates may open for you. Of course that freedom makes publication more likely not less. <br><br>Oooh one other thought. Do you belong to a writers group? I do. The great feedback has motivated my friend to keep writing while sleep deprived and nursing babies. It works!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mel, I agree with all you're saying.  I got that same "a-ha" moment  you describe in playing tennis when I did warrior camp with Harv Eker about 10 years ago.  I realized I wanted to live life the way I played sports - all out at 110%, didn't care if I looked stupid at times, cheer for the other team as well as my own, be a team player and above all, enjoy myself.<br><br>I don't consider this book as something that will ever be published.  It's a practice book that will probably gather dust under a bed some day.  And maybe I'll have a lot of practice books, who knows?  It doesn't matter, since I'm starting to feel the joy of writing again that I had when I was younger.   I will look into a writer's group as well, but not until this winter, when I'm done this job and will need some social outlets. Peer pressure is good.  :-)<br><br>I'm going to think about the A vs. C book or using AFC in a more directed way.  The only way that works for me is to try things on and see what fits.  <br><br>Have an awesome time playing tennis and kill that ball !!!</div>

<div class="content">Thanks so much. We have a lot of shared interests though that is to be expected as it seems we both have a lot of interests. :-) <br><br>I am thrilled to hear you are excited about writing. One of the saddest things I ever heard my therapy clients say was that they hadn't lived their dream. You will love a writers group! I am thinking of doing nanowrimo in November. I would like it if my son would do all the revisions. Lol<br><br>I am going to be teaching my kids piano with the Suzuki method. There is so much wisdom in this method for task management. Little and often. Don't criticize. Keep breaking down til you can do it. Keep rehearsing tasks done properly (imagine yourself working optimally throughout the day rather than listen to the music). I think I have had very unsuzuki like experiences with learning. My piano teachers never praised. I receive much more critique than enthusiasm especially from myself. To do AF Suzuki style, your goal for this week might be to write down everything you have to do every day in your notebook. That's it! Easy! The next week it might be to also write down everything you want to do like web surf or chat online. The steps would be small and would build. There would only be much joy and enthusiasm as each step were mastered.<br><br>Contrast this with what we tend to do...I am not doing the important things! I spent too much time online! I avoid dismissing! Maybe it's time for a kinder gentler approach to making AF a part of our lives.</div>
