<div class="content">This morning my five-year-old saw me jotting some things in my AF book and demanded her own list, complete with boxes to color in when she finished a task.  <br><br>So far she has actioned "put away laundry", "pack for thanksgiving", and "sing a song for Mommy and Daddy" with "do 'n' homework" and "talk to grandparents on computer" still open.<br><br>:^)</div>

<div class="content">Sarah, that sounds absolutely adorable!  I always thought AF was like a game, hopefully it will be a fun game for her.  But it sounds like she's doing all the hard stuff first - better than I was doing when I first started!  Good for her!  :-)</div>

<div class="content">That is so cute :-)<br><br>I too feel that AF is rather ludic, and that's one of the things that makes it unique.<br><br>Maybe it could be used to train children in productivity. Sara, I'm curious to know how she'll deal with dismissing ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Well, this morning she wondered why "talk to grandma and opa" wasn't colored in and we explained that she hadn't done it, but that it wasn't her fault because they weren't home.  And I told her that we just leave it on the list.  We'll see if she remains interested - I'm certainly not going to force her to do it but if she shows more interest, what the heck.</div>

<div class="content">I've always felt that Time Management SHOULD be one of the things we teach kids. Like balancing a checkbook, it's the kind of real life skill that should be in your bones before you're an adult an really need it!</div>

<div class="content">ds, I definitely agree but I also know my child's capabilities, and she's a very flighty five-year-old who still needs to be reminded to go to the toilet.  First things first.  ;^)</div>
