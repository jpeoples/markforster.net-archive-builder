<div class="content">A friend of mine who lives in another city who is quite efficient with respect to work was asked by a workmate today if she used Autofocus!<br><br>My friend had heard about it through me, but isn't a time management kind of person, but thought it was hilarious that her friend thought she used it.  Too cool !!</div>
