<div class="content">I wonder how AF suits to students preparing failed exams, when it comes to choose between tasks and you have to face procrastination due to fear of failing again =)</div>

<div class="content">I'm a grad student and I'm using AF to manage tasks related to my thesis, my work as an adjunct professor, and side research projects (as well as life with a four year old).  It works great.</div>

<div class="content">I also used Autofocus to complete my thesis. I filled my list with tasks like "research for chapter 4", "proofread section 2.2", "write section 3.1" and so on. You could try the same for the information you need to learn for your exams. Either break it down to small things, or have a list with "study for exam A", "study for exam B". I found breaking it down made it easier for me to overcome procrastination.</div>

<div class="content">I work full time, have a family, and am in grad school.  With AF, this is the first time in my academic career I've actually been not only keeping up, but getting ahead--all without sacrificing family time or letting my work suffer.  It's been amazing, really.  I'd be interested to hear how it would work for high school and college (undergrad) students.</div>

<div class="content">I think that the pomodore technique (  <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.pomodorotechnique.com</a> ) is closer than AF to the single-mindedness (taskness) a student needs to prepare exams.<br>As for fighting procrastination one needs Patience, Organisation (knowing what's needed and what's been done) and Optimism (it's going to be al-right  )</div>
