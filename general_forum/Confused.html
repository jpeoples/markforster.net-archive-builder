<div class="content">OK, so I have taken a brief hiatus from this site, and now am confused.  I see Super Focus as a point of discussion, but no links to the definitive rules for this system.  And I see AF 1-4, which is pretty clear.  Additionally, I see references to something called Super Auto Focus or SAF.  How do I get started with SuperFocus 2.0 so I can be ready when Mark goes to 3.0?</div>

<div class="content">TK:<br><br>Super Auto Focus is what SuperFocus was called at first. They are the same thing.<br><br>The current rules for SuperFocus are to be found at:<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1317396" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1317396</a><br><br>I am currently engaged in testing another revision of the SuperFocus rules (see <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1379463" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1379463</a> ) which will make it the perfect time management system. No further development of systems will be necessary after that.</div>

<div class="content">Unfortunately I think that i can predict SF3 wont be that "perfect system" for many (or at least myself) for a a very practical reason : the 2 columns SAF format demands too much page real estate for those "always on the go" people who want a system that can fit in a compact (A6) notebook. My handwriting is messy and I dont want to carry an expensive electronic device on myself (beside a basic cell phone). Maybe someone will find a way to make it work? We'll see...</div>

<div class="content">Maybe the  left page serves as 1st column and the right page as 2nd column?</div>

<div class="content">Could be a solution, could it still work elegantly that way? I cant tell, as i havent tryed SAF (or any of Marks system tbh). Has anybody used SAF successfully that way? It seemed to me (I have read a LOT through this forum) that the 2 column format was one of the most common reason many people didnt fully adopt the SAF system (while still recognizing it was a VERY efficient one).</div>

<div class="content">Tried SAF  for one week, but gave it up because it didn't fit the way I organize my tasks.</div>

<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>I've never tried SAF before, because, when Mark first revealed it, I was in the middle of my DWM2 infatuation.  However, when Mark announced that he was revising it six days ago, I was curious on how SAF actually feels on using it, and so I tried it right there and then.  <br><br>I am surprised by how it actually fits my personality.  I am by nature very impulsive and intuitive, and I have always wanted a task management system that will support my tendency to drop things in the middle of doing them to do something else that just pops in my head that feels to be more important for the moment.  Well, SAF fits my needs: if I have to do something while I am in the middle of something else, I'd just cross out the item that I had been doing from my AF list, rewrite it in Column 2, write what I am about to do also in Column 2, do that something, cross that item out when finished, then resume what I was doing before (reminded to me by the item just next to the one I had just crossed out.<br><br>The problem with SAF that I found is that it has even a stronger tendency for easy tasks to be done at the expense of more difficult ones than the other AFs.  This was solved very neatly by the Gatekeeper System (GKS: <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1384353" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1384353</a> ) that I am using: now I am forced to do at least one difficult but worthwhile task before I could open Column 1 of the next page.<br><br>Since the notebook I am using is quite small (half-US letter size, or 5.5"x8.5") I am using the left page as Column 1 and right page as Column 2. It does not actually eats paper like we do potato chips, but I can see that one can quickly run out of paper with this, if that person is busy enough.  However, aside from that SAFv1.2+GKS has been working very well, no problems with it currently.<br><br>Of course, I have the sneaking feeling that when SAFv1.3 is revealed my own management system will be placed by the wayside ^___^<br><br>God bless!</div>

<div class="content">I don't recall any complaints that SAF didn't fit the page.  I found it sometimes very good and sometimes confusing (how do I decide what to do next).</div>

<div class="content">If you use an 8.5" x 11" notebook as Mark did in the video interview, then there's really no problem. But, if one uses a 5.5" x 8.5" notebook like a lot of us do, then dividing the paper into 2 columns becomes a problem. There's not enough room to write.<br><br>Matt</div>

<div class="content">The SAF page-size problem with a small notebook is easy to solve:   Count an entire "spread" as one page (i.e., left side and right side of an open spread = one SAF "page").  The left side is the left column - the right side is the right column.<br><br>Has worked very well for me, using a pocket-sized Moleskinesque notebook (3.5x5.25" or 9x13cm).</div>

<div class="content">I'm currently using the standard size Moleskine notebook. I don't have any problem fitting two columns into a page, but if you do then use a two page spread as Seraphim suggests.</div>
