<div class="content">I use DWM with a digital system. Having a number of roles I like being able to filter instantly for the current place. (A one list, write everything once policy!)<br><br>I also think it grounding to use the structure of the calendar, so stay with the original DWM.<br><br>But I'm wondering if there are any insights in Superfocus which I can add to my use of DWM. For example, the extra column - if I stay on a particular task all day I may overlook something much further down the list, so I can see a possible benefit of bringing certain items closer on the radar, maybe in the second column on the next day.<br><br>Does anyone think this is worth trying? Are there any other benefits I could incorporate? Any digital methods yet for SAF?</div>

<div class="content">DWM already has the second column although it isn't visually distinguished. Try it though: When you reenter a task on day W, put that task in column 2 (or just mark it as virtually in column 2).  Then read <a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2011/2/9/handling-various-tasks-in-superfocus.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2011/2/9/handling-various-tasks-in-superfocus.html</a> and see what makes sense.  <br><br>Maybe reenter Unfinished on tomorrow instead of next week to get a similar forcefulness?</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Alan. I think I see what you mean, though I'm using DWM not DWM2. So I could set a flag on the items I re-enter to next week, and filter on them from time to time . . .<br><br>Last couple of days I landed on a major project and stayed there. Result: some progress, but had to dismiss my "Gmail" task this morning. Oops. That should have been visible for me, ideally, beforehand.<br><br>So I can appreciate that SAF addresses this issue and I guess others too.</div>
