<div class="content">Alison,<br><br>I don't know of one.<br><br>However, the post are in order of most recent comment, which helps somewhat. Until I started following this forum, I was unaware that <end> would take me to the bottom of a web page where you will find the most recent comment, or that <back> would take me back to the posts list. I now use them a lot, along with <page up>.<br><br>Of course, if you're reading this on an iPhone, you'll need the "scroll to bottom" bookmarklet.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Alison<br>I don't think there is.  I just make a note of when I was last on.  For instance: yesterday evening at about 7pm.  Then this morning, just go to the thread that appears with the earliest post after this time. Hit <END> as Will says (something I too learnt from this forum) and read from there and then <HOME> to go back to the top.  It is quite efficient really, but I do remember feeling confused as at the beginning as to how to keep up with just the new posts.</div>

<div class="content">Alison R:<br><br>What Will and Stephanie have said is correct. I hope one day Squarespace will provide this facility but at the moment they don't. In the meantime the threads are shown in the order of most recent post. So you can either start at the first thread shown and work back, or do as Stephanie suggests.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks - using the end and home buttons will help a lot!  I really love this forum and keep dipping into the blogs - and I always find something interesting to read!</div>

<div class="content">As mentioned in some older threads, the SiteDelta addon for Firefox gives you that functionality. I once made a screencast demonstrating installation and usage here: <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/850591#post852041" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/850591#post852041</a><br><br>The only problem is that watching a page for changes takes resources, and if you put many sites on your watchlist, it may slow your computer down.</div>
