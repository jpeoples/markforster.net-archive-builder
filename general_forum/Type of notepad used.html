<div class="content">Hi All<br><br>Just thought I would state what notepad I am using and would be interested to hear what size/type/no of lines etc others are using! Also - advantages / disadvantages too<br><br>I had an A5 pad lying around and decided to try that - approximately 15cm by 21cm - it is actually ring-bound in the middle.<br><br>Advantages <br>Can see more that one page at a time - also can see pages together (spread out) or front and back <br>Ring binders help to flick through the pages easily<br><br>'top-flip' pads would be harder to use (as well as the pages getting snagged) - although you could write top-down on each page so that all the pages read the same way</div>

<div class="content">Nick:<br><br>I'm using a standard A4 refill pad with 34 lines to the page of the sort you can buy at any stationers (in the UK at least). I'm not using any binder with it. It opens sideways and the pages lie quite flat enough for writing on easily. It's exactly the same sort of pad I used to write my daily journal in.<br><br>I think the more lines to the page (within reason) the better the "autofocus" aspect of the system would work - but that's only my impression: I haven't tested it out thoroughly.<br></div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br>By 'binder' I meant that the pages are attached using a metal spiral.<br><br>How do you keep your pages together if they are not attached and you are not using a binder? My experience of A4 lined paper is that they get separated easily.</div>

<div class="content">I'm using a loose leaf notebook that's bound with discs not rings, and it allows me to add, remove and rearrange pages at will.  I can never write comfortably on both sides of the page with a normal ring binder, but these discs are about only 1cm in diameter, and in addition the whole thing folds back on itself.  So it's very easy to write on if you're not at a proper desk or table.<br><br>ADOC make them, although I'm using one from WH Smiths because I wanted an A5 book, which ADOC don't make.  But this is what the ADOC A4 book looks like:<br><br><a href="http://www.ryman.co.uk/Adoc-Multi-Task-File-A4-Black-Cover-0320230401.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.ryman.co.uk/Adoc-Multi-Task-File-A4-Black-Cover-0320230401.asp</a><br><br>Because it's A5 I can carry it around with me.  I have two lists set up in different parts of the book, one for work and one for home.  Other pages elsewhere in the book can hold miscellaneous notes, and ideas for projects - anything I need to be able to jot down at any time.  When pages are finished, I can take them out.<br><br>I love using pencil and paper, because it's so simple and always available.  I've tried electronic systems, but they're never so immediate.<br></div>

<div class="content">I use an A4 spiralbound notebook with 28 lines to a page and write with a pen. It's basically the idea of a lab/log book, i.e., pages do not get rearranged, and everything that's been written can be crossed out but not erased. I guess purely, one would not use spiralbound, but hardbound and never remove any sheets;  but the spiralbound is more convenient in that it opens and folds flat, and sometimes it is useful to be able to remove a blank sheet when necessary.</div>

If you want, you can carry around 2 or 3 in your pocket (one for Work; one for Home; and one as a Journal).  I carry two around as I work out of my home (one for tasks and the other as a journal/ubiquitous recorder of whatever comes into my head).</div>

<div class="content">I use a soft-cover A4 exercise book. I prefer "Quad & Margin" as it enables me to easily use the columns for categorizing if I so wish (e.g. errands; time sensitive items, work vs private tasks etc). <br><br>I only use the right hand page for recording tasks. The left hand page can be used for jotting down notes, expanding on tasks (cross referenced from the right hand side), doodling, keywords etc. It can also be used for keeping a tally of time spent on various groups of work such as e-mail, paperwork and tasks, so as to ensure sufficient balance.</div>

<div class="content">I'm using 2 A5 bound notebooks with funky covers, one for home and one for work.  Because I had them kicking around not being used.  They have 25 lines to a page which I feel is more than long enough for a list. The only disadvantage is the lack of width which means one or two wok tasks requiring more detail ( so I understand the task) don't fit onto a single line ( currently have squeezed them in rather than overflow and shorten the list. I am considering using only every other page which then leaves space for overflow and also for extra notes ( phone numbers etc)</div>

<div class="content">I had bought a letter size (A4) 28 numbered lined pad to start with, but am thinking of keeping with my Miquelrius flexible notebook that I've been using since October 2007. It is undated, quadrille ruled and around 300 pages. I've tried lots of different ways of recording and tracking things with it, the latest being one section for a list, much like any other dated list, and another section for my Will Do closed list where I would also deep a daily record of time and events of the day, all work related.<br><br>With Autofocus I can merge the two and perhaps get a better handle on what "a day's worth of work" really looks like, though my job has a significant reactionary component to it. Since the list is dated as Mark mentions somewhere in these forums, I don't see why notes on time spent and events can't be made in a margin somewhere.<br><br>This could work with Moleskine or any other undated, bound book also.<br><br>The important things are that the tool you use can keep up with the system and that it is one you enjoy using which will help keep the system going.<br><br>On a side note, I do a lot of delegating and assigning tasks to my staff, so the idea of keeping all this electronically is appealing as I can just cut, paste and print and not have to rewrite.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Clay<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Another contributor (Lena) has mentioned a Circa Notebook by Levenger (in the home vs work thread). <br><br>As far as I know this is a notebook that lies flat and can have pages added and/or taken away, and where it's possible to add tabs and dividers. I thought this system was very difficult to get hold of in the UK. Does anyone know where it's possible to get them (without having to take out a second mortgage to by the special paper punch for using your own paper!). <br><br>Or perhaps someone knows of a similar system?

<div class="content">Thanks everyone for links to these 'flexible binding systems' (new lingo I just picked up!). <br><br>Has anyone tried using a large filofax to do this sort of stuff? I was wondering if there were any disadvantages (apart from the large initial outlay - A4 filofax organisers are VERY expensive, however their hole punches are not, so can use any paper you like - unlike Atoma and Circa, etc).<br><br>I quite like the idea of having my diary and my lists in the same place rather than carrying multiple things around with me all the time.<br><br>Any thoughts anyone?</div>

<div class="content">I am using a Bur-o-class notebook. They are slightly wider than A5, the same size as a child's exercise book, and cost £1.95 from Ryman's. I love them (use them for journalling too). They are really cheap and they have a waterproof cover, which means they can double as coasters for my mug.<br><br>For those of you who prefer A4 and are looking for loads of lines, narrow ruled A4 pads for students have 45 lines per page. You can buy them in Ryman's or WHSmith's. You need to have fairly neat writing for them though.</div>

<div class="content">I'm using a wire bound Cambridge recycled A4 pad,  32 lines per page.  Right hand for AF tasks, left hand for notes.<br><br>One thing that is dwelling on my mind a bit (although not as much as time passes, I admit) is how to integrate date specific items into the same format.   I have been toying with the idea of using a page-per-day diary in 'dual mode' -  use it as a normal AF list for normal AF entries,  simply ignoring the date and using it as neutral pages,    but add date-specific stuff (follow-up reminders,  pick up tickets or dry cleaning,  whatever..)  in an underlined section of the appropriate date.   <br><br>As time passes I'm becoming less convinced that this will work as it adds enough complecity to introduce confusion and resistance.

<div class="content">Hi Dave<br><br>The easiest way to handle date specific tasks is with a journal or calendar.  However make sure that is kept for true date specific tasks and not tasks that maybe just have a deadline. By all means put deadlines on a calendar if you need to but include those tasks in your AF - you may well find they are done long before the deadline.  Similarly follow up tasks can easily be kept in AF - you will see the reminder regularly as you scan through the lists.  Don't forget to add a "check scheduke" task though!</div>

<div class="content">Dave,<br><br>your idea is similar to my GTD-DIT-mixture system:<br><br>A4 notebook.<br>Left page dated carrying the entries for appointments and tasks to do on that day. Horizontal line under this, under this line the emergencies and same day tasks that come up during the day.<br>Right page: GTD-type next actions list: 'at work' top down, 'at home' bottom up, divided by a horizontal line <br><br>This system works fine as long I am disciplined enough to always leave at least one empty line at the bottom of the left page (for emergencies and same day tasks). But if I use the space that's below the  horizontal line for the many 'super brilliant' ideas that I have during the day then I'm getting into trouble , running up of space for the emergencies and same day tasks.<br>You need to always have post-its or a small notepad at hand to take notes with this system.<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">I was actually quite reluctant to join the notebook debate but found an excellent notebook which I thought may be of interest to some (UK only I'm afraid!).  Tesco's Finest Executive Note Book comes in A4 or A5, cheap at £4.00 or £2.50, and the page has margins left and right for ticks or date markings.  The left hand margin would make a great tick box for left handed AF'ers as this was mentioned earlier.  The A4 notebook has 38 lines to a page.</div>

<div class="content">I too was reluctant to join the great notebook debate.  I thought that I had more important things to think about, such as actually getting things done!  But, losing my A4 notebook has given me the opportunity to use an A5 bound notebook.  This is not a "designer" notebook with a fancy name - it was free with a magazine and works fine.  It has about 20 lines to a page but I haven't actually counted them.  I haven't found it better to have more lines to a page.  I do actually need a smaller closed list to have any hope of getting things done.  If I see too many things on a list I immediately become overwhelmed and that just induces inertia.</div>

<div class="content">I have to say I like Dave's idea of using a daily diary for this; I think it might be useful to see the available blocks of time at the same time that you're looking at the task list (granted the list would be longer than the current day). You could draw a line down the middle of the page; on the left, the calendar; on the right the task list. I don't have a ton of appointments but i do block out time for specific tasks. I just have not tended to look at my to-do list while blocking time--I've kept that in my head as to what I needed to do with that time.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Ranier<br>My system is set up quite similarly to yours.  To handle notes, I created a tab at the back end of my binder and filled it with blank pages. It is here that I jot down my various thoughts to review when I deem appropriate.  I devised this method for precisely the same reason.  I, too, wanted to capture my ideas yet didn't want to pollute my diary section pages.  Make sure that the tab is plenty big and made of strong stock!  Some days can be quite prolific with ideas!

<div class="content">In my continuing struggle to make AF work at work, I use an A5 Atoma notebook with reorderable pages. What I noticed just recently, is that it's actually nice that you can add additional notes for the tasks into a separate section at the end of the notebook. Since pages are replaceable, you don't have to worry about running out of pages in either section (which also solves all problems with 'filling up' your notebook and having to transfer your tasks). That way, you have a place to write down everything that would end up on scraps of paper otherwise (I don't feel like setting up a 'project' folder for every little note). It also gives you a bit of the additional annotation possibilities you'd have with a digital setup. <br><br>Since my notebook only has 25 lines per page, I use 2-page spreads as AF 'pages'. I'm not sure this works quite as well as the original page-as-closed-list method. Unfortunately, Atoma notebooks are sold here in Germany only in one 'flavor' than I'm not too excited about, and only by Manufactum, who are notoriously expensive.<br><br>For my home lists, I use a Moleskine Pocket Volant which not only has even fewer lines per page (22), but which is so small that I often need two lines for a task, so two-page spreads are mandatory there as well. Honestly, the Volant doesn't feel quite right as an AF notebook, but it fits nicely with the Moleskine Pocket Weekly Planner.<br><br>Mark, what exactly is a "standard A4 refill pad"? I noticed your notepad in the video, but we don't seem to have those here. It could be a nice (and cheap) alternative to the Atoma notebooks.</div>

<div class="content">Alex:<br><br>That is correct. It's just a pad of paper!</div>

<div class="content">3"x5" vertical format spiral wire binding.  It opens flat so I can hold it in my hand if necessary.  I get them from Sam's Club (U.S.) at 10 for about $5.00 so the price can't be beat.  I got a fine point ball point pen that breaks in half so it just fits into the rings and stays with the pad.  I have three plastic paperclips (I don't like metal because they tear paper) one for first active page, one for current page, one for last page.  I get 15 lines per page and I found that doubling it by putting two items on a space (one near the top line and another near the bottom) I get 30 per page which does work better for me.  I do write small and that fine point pen helps.<br><br>I flip the pages and book over to write on the back so I only work in one direction.  I use the back of the book (last page toward first) to hold my Tickler items and Shopping lists, etc.  I tear those out as they fill.<br><br>I also carry a 4"x6" vertical format wire spiral bound book for journaling.  I put notes of phone calls, meetings, thoughts about this and that, etc. in that book.  No special anything about it except that it is just a tad larger so I can write lots of text in it without feeling like I'm writing a list.<br><br>The whole thing fits right in my pocket.<br><br>I went shopping for a bound reporters book but found that I did not like them because they would not lie flat when opened as the spiral ones do and I don't like that cover flapping around.<br><br>I find that I'm still tweaking the system but backing out just as many tweaks as I'm putting in.  It seems to work best when kept simple.</div>

<div class="content">I use a Moleskine lined pocket journal. I <I>want </i>to go over to using 3x5 cards, and probably will at some point, since that's my preferred collection mechanism... (I like the Levenger "Shirtpocket Briefcase" very much...)<br><br>I also use an Olympus digital voice recorder to collect stuff when I'm driving...</div>

<div class="content">I bought a hard-cover A5 book for the purpose of AF.  I like the smaller size for portability.  I prefer to write in pencil.  I also don't like writing scrunched up, so I am writing on every second line.  BUT I treat everything you can see when the book is open as "a page".  So both actual pages of the book form 1 AF page.  I write12 items on each 24-line block, giving me 24 items per AF page.  Seems to be good so far - though after reading this thread, I am thinking that maybe I should experiment with more items per page.</div>

<div class="content">Mark, <br><br>just for the sake of completeness: What you're using, is called "College-Block" or "Kolleg-Block" in German (A4 or A5, about 80-100 pages, ruled or squared, perforated, pre-punched for 4-ring binders). Please note that this term only applies to the spiral-bound variety, which is the only one I've ever seen here.</div>

<div class="content">There are some interesting journals here on Picadilly - it would seem to be a good idea if you wanted to focus on a vision for various aspects of life - health, balance, etc.<br><br><a href="http://piccadillyinc.com/system/system_everything.php" rel="nofollow">http://piccadillyinc.com/system/system_everything.php</a><br><br><a href="http://piccadillyinc.com/system.php" rel="nofollow">http://piccadillyinc.com/system.php</a><br><br></div>

<div class="content">I use a Rolla brand notebook which I think is like a Circa knockoff.  It was pretty inexpensive and I picked it up at Staples last year for general note-taking.   It's an A5 and the pages can be reordered, refilled, etc.  Mine has a a hard cover and folds all the way around to lay flat.  The paper has lines on both sides and a box at the top for a title/page number (not labeled that way but I assume that's what it is intended to be).  I found a link to their products here:<br><br><a href="http://www.rollabind.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rollabind.com/</a><br><br>I started on A5 legal pages, then a pocket-size flip notebook.  I switched to the tiny notebook thinking I would use it for mobility, but I never did.  I put all my errands and grocery lists into remember the milk because I always have my phone with me so that made more sense to put those tasks there.  If I think of something to add to AF while I am away from my notebook, I just whip out my phone and email the task to myself.  I can then write it down when I get back to my desk.  Never thought I'd se the day when I would transfer things from electronic to paper.<br><br><br>I am sticking with the Rolla mainly because I can remove the completed pages and insert new as needed.  No need to keep track of more than one notebook.<br><br>Also - as a side note - since I work from home, I put all home and work tasks into one list.  It doesn't bother me to have them together.  I didn't like having to stop and think about which list it needed to go on when I went to record it.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">So can one use this system with digital notebooks ... like Evernote(www.evernote.com)?<br></div>

<div class="content">Eric:<br><br>Yes, I would imagine that it would be very easy to use this system with Evernote. You would simply have a set limit for the number of items in each Note. Evernote comes with tick boxes so you can easily indicate the completed tasks. You could have a category "AF List" which you remove from completed pages.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Mark ... and since Evernote syncs immediately between my home Mac, work Mac and iPhone ... I can always jot down ideas/todos, etc. and access them on any computer, or even online at my Evernote site. Eric</div>

<div class="content">Although I'd use a student block like Mark's if I was using paper, I did notice some A5 and A6 Atoma type notebooks in WH Smiths in Reading, UK at the weekend. Though I didn't see any paper or punches.<br><br></div>
