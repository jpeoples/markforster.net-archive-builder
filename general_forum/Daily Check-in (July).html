<div class="content">July 02<br>Worked the list all week at work.  Didn't need to dismiss anything.  At home it's still a small challenge to keep at it, but I make sure I work the list for a certain time period after work.</div>

<div class="content">Lose 15 lbs - down .8 of a pound.<br>Declutter garage - Cleared out 3 bags of garbage from the garage and a trunk load of stuff for goodwill.  Good progress on that.

Need to learn how to sleep more I think.<br>Bathroom reno - No work on bathroom.<br>15 minutes cleaning - done. <br>Sigh... I can see why people only pick one project at a time to focus on.<br><br>Not feeling comfortable with AF2 for home - I want to go back to AF condensed again.  It's so much easier to focus on a single page even if I have no intention of finishing all of it.<br><br>Didn't use AF2 back at work yesterday.  Spent the day clearing the inbox from 2 weeks holiday and identifying projects that need to be done this month.<br></div>

<div class="content">July 7, So far, have worked AF2 every day for a week. Have only dismissed 2 items and actually had one dismissed item become resurrected. My lurking-task-anxiety is way down. I know what I have to choose from and that helps fuel doing them and moving away from procrastination.</div>

<div class="content">Lose 15 lbs - not sure how I stand, but I forgot my lunch, so accidentally fasted today apart from a can of tuna.  :-) Cooked my breakfast egg muffins for the week tonight.  Must withstand Stampede breakfast tomorrow - NO pancakes.<br>Declutter garage - listed a couple of items on freecycle, got snatched up right away - man, that's time consuming to respond to people.  Should just have a free garage sale.<br>Earn $10k - Earned a whopping $75 in consulting income.  Total for mo.:  $225<br>Novel - Wrote the beginning of the prologue during lunch.   Intended to expand my outline, so not such a great success.<br>Exercise - Missed my workout this a.m. and don't feel like doing it tonight. MUST SLEEP MORE.  I have to learn how to get more than 4-6 hours of sleep a night.<br>Bathroom reno - called and tentatively booked bathtub reglazing, got name of bathroom contractor, booking appt for quote tomorrow.  <br>15 minutes cleaning - done<br><br>I'm caving on following AF2 at home and work.  Glad to see that others who are like me, who don't have urgent tasks are going back as well.  I REALLY like AF condensed and feel it is more conducive to getting the important things done - and allows me to push my limits on a daily basis.  And I REALLY like AF1 on weekends when I have all day free to work on it and close off old active pages.  <br><br>I have a bunch of projects at work due to being away for 2 weeks, so am happy again there because I have "too much" to do - and I love being in that situation.  Not being busy has made me dislike the job itself and made me procrastinate on what I do have to do.  Not using AF at work, but am using my usual methods of *focus* - one project at a time - and compulsion for closure.  Just can't mess with what works well already.<br></div>

<div class="content">Time for my Sunday update - I haven't got much to report as I was on holiday this week and didn't do any business planning work while I was away.

Going to switch back to pure AF1 from AF condensed.  Wrote a page of AF items that I can do at work and will do AF1 in the evenings with dismissal occurring on weekends only.  Sticking to my set of 3 routine habits that I've managed to establish for the mornings - dishwasher, laundry and exercise.<br><br>Lucy, Dragon's Den sounds like an interesting show - I have read Duncan Bannatyne's book.  What strikes me from most books by self-made men on business is that they all seemed to have been so driven to work long hours etc.  Have you ever read Richard Koch's stuff?  I like his philosophy, and his book "The Star Principle" might be one you'd be interested in reading if you're going the entrepreneurial route.<br></div>

<div class="content">Lose 15 lbs - maintained total loss 2.2 pounds, only thing that will help reach goal at this time is bringing out the low carb "big gun"<br>Declutter garage - 1 hour spent breaking apart old dresser and cutting it up for firewood for camping this weekend.

Total for mo.: $725 <br>Novel - did nothing (total 830); trying to think of how to do this with using AF1 - write scenes out on the list??; am bringing my writing notebook on the camping trip but am going with friends so may not have solitude to write<br>Exercise - won't have time today as going camping this weekend - should be beautiful weather so will do lots of biking and hiking on the weekend<br>Bathroom reno - ceiling people came in with a quote of $4k - yikes!  (One of the downsides of renovating a huge house).  Might do it myself instead since I know how, it's just messy...  General bathroom contractor quote people didn't show up???  WTH? Found a picture online of exactly what I want to do with the reno and it wouldn't be difficult to do myself.  Found a tiling class geared towards the home renovator at the local technical institute that I can take this fall.  I'd really like to learn to do this myself since I want to renovate houses in the future as well and want to tile the kitchen backsplash and another bathroom in this house, so it may be what I'll do since I'll probably save myself $6k by taking the course.  Found a company online that specializes in beadboard styles which fit the picture that I have and will mean I won't have to re-drywall which was my sticking point and why I was getting a contractor.<br>15 minutes cleaning - done<br><br></div>

<div class="content">A day late with my Sunday update - spent yesterday cooking for and then attending my friend's daughter's 18th birthday party.<br><br>I worked on research for the business plan earlier in the week but have since suspended work on it having discovered some information which makes me doubt the whole idea.  So, I have shifted my emphasis back to more exploratory work rather than focusing on this single idea.  It feels a bit disappointing but I guess ideas evolve and this is all part of the journey.  And better to discover any serious flaws in the plan at this point!<br><br>Used AF2 most days last week and it worked well.  I have similar issues to the discussions about getting to the end and dismissing tasks in the other thread but I'm trying to just roll with it.  I've made 'review dismissed tasks' part of my weekly review so that alleviates any concern about dismissing things - though will probaby tag any I re-add so they don't just hang around repeatedly going through that cycle.<br><br>One thing I want to make a real effort with this week is to put everything into AF2 so if I have a busy weekend as I just have I won't be 'off AF2' but simply focussing on the end of the list where I can write things before I do them.<br><br>Jacqueline, thanks for the book recommendation.  Given the report on my business progress above you will see that this came at just the right time!  I've ordered a copy and I'm looking forward to reading it.<br><br>Best wishes<br>Lucy<br></div>

<div class="content">Marty, I bought a mini sized sink/vanity for my small bathroom to try and maximize the space.  Now I just need mini taps, it appears!<br><br>Zane, I really do think that fast-5 is very similar to the No S diet.  For me it's the restricting of the snacking.  I know some people do fast-5 as a "window" and eat for 5 hours.  I don't, I eat one meal around 2 p.m. and one around 6-7 p.m.  That's it.  I honestly don't get hungry until maybe 11 a.m., then it goes away and doesn't come back until mid afternoon.  The key for me is that the 2 p.m. meal has to a) have > 25g of protein & b) be ~ 750 calories.  That ensures that it'll tide me over so that I am not actually hungry when I eat the second and last meal of the day.   (And not hungry when I do a run through the grocery store either!)<br><br>Fortunately, I don't have sugar cravings and don't eat huge portions.  My poison is high salt foods and (used to be) wobbly pops.  I quit that though since AF gives me another hobby.  :-)</div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline,<br><br>If/when Fast-5 doesn't do it for you, try the No S diet.  Only 3 rules, it works, and it can be done for life.  ( <a href="http://www.nosdiet.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.nosdiet.com</a> )</div>

<div class="content">July 31 summary<br>Lose 15 lbs - last week or so sticking to a Fast-5 protocol - down 5 pounds total - I forgot how incredibly easy this was to follow (for me).  Happy not to have met the goal and change the focus to process rather than outcome.  August goal will be to follow fast-5 w/90% compliance.<br>Declutter garage - about 75% completed, just have to take the time to go through some boxes - son is moving out in a couple of weeks so a lot will go to him.  August goal will be to finish this.  Every box is listed separately on the list, so it will get done.<br>Earn $10k - very surprised that I made just over $7.5k (last minute legal/sale crises/deadlines pushed this up alot over the last few days). Will be working every day this long weekend (work babysitter coming in for the weekend to keep my butt in chair) so I will easily make over $10k in August.  Have to constantly remind myself to "make hay when the sun shines." As much as I'd rather be out camping, it's a financially stupid thing to do right now.<br>Novel - this hasn't worked out very well although the outline is partially done and the prologue is written.  I have ordered a book that breaks down the steps to plotting and writing that stresses small daily actions which I hope will help.  August goal will be to finish the outline.  All on the list, but in a clump, so may have to break it up using the little lines at the bottom of the page to use RAF properly.<br>Exercise - still doing slow, intense weight training in the mornings. I do have a gym membership (that I've hardly used) and plan to hit the gym on weekends for 20 minute leg workout (I don't have a squat rack at home).  My son has been walking the dog every day, so I haven't been doing that enough, but I get a lot of fast walking and stairs in around campus at work.  August goal will be to keep training weekday mornings and hit the gym for legs every weekend.<br>Bathroom reno - Floor is 75% removed (glued down mdf), ceiling painted, toilet ready to be taken off, walls prepped, beadboard ordered, light fixture bought, moulding and casing and door style decided upon for whole house, tile off around tub (removal left holes in drywall).  August goal will be to finish this project.  It's all on the list.<br>15 minutes cleaning - doing well with reverse AF but should increase this to 20 minutes in August and get my kids to join me more often.<br><br>Overall, in every case I didn't meet the goal, I'm happy I didn't do what it would have taken to meet it (sacrifice of balance).  <br></div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline - that's an amazing list of accomplishments for one month!  Congratulations.<br><br>Could you explain how you do the 15 minute cleaning thing? The times I have been most consistent and happy with my housework situation have come from spending 15 minutes a day, generally starting with the dishes and just doing whatever else seemed good at the time for at least 15 minutes. Never perfect, but my best by far. Do you think this fits with AF?<br></div>
<h2>Reply by Jacqueline</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-07-31 14:38</div>
<div class="content">Hi Jessica, thanks!  <br><br>Re. the cleaning, sometimes it stood out with AF1 pretty naturally on its own.  If I was seeing that I wouldn't even touch cleaning using AF1 that day, I was switching to AF2 and writing what needed to be done and the time I would take (used my microwave timer).  So I was (at the time) sort of doing RAF in the reverse way, doing AF1 and switching to AF2 at the end of the day.  If you give yourself 3 minutes to clean the living room, you can move super fast and get it 50% done - which is good enough for me!  At some point, I'd like to be able to do that, and get it 95% done, I never want to be 100% (unless I'm selling a house).   <br><br>So, I would take the major rooms and write at the end of the list:<br><br>- kitchen - 3 min.<br>- bedroom - 3 min.<br>- bathroom - 3 min.<br>- LR/DR - 3 min.<br>- library - 3 min.<br><br>and do whatever "stood out" (sometimes literally!) in that room.  I'd rotate a bit and put in hallways, kids room, basement, laundry room, etc. occasionally.  (I have a very large house though.)  I didn't count the garage, laundry (daily every a.m.) or dishes in the cleaning time.  The laundry and dishes are part of my *new*! morning routine.<br><br>I think one of the things that's really helping is that I'm about 25% decluttered and am getting more ruthless with purging as I go along.  I eventually want to get back to the minimalism of my 20's and downsize to a little house (I just bought this house to flip).  Stuff doesn't make me happy, people and experiences do. :-)<br></div>
