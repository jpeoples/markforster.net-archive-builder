<div class="content">I've been using AutoFocus since April, and AutoFocus 2 since last Saturday. So far I really love AF2, addresses all the issues I had with AF.<br><br>One thing that's bothering me more and more though: the dismissal process in both AF and AF2 makes me more acutely aware of the fact that my workload is too high. I guess I should be happy about that, but I've been telling myself that I really can handle all these projects, that I'm just not efficient enough. Apparently it's time for a reality check...<br><br>Anybody else have this experience?</div>

<div class="content">Yep, I have this all the time - it's like there's too many interesting things in life to dip your toe into, so you end up trying to eat everything at once and don't really enjoy any of it. (How's that for a mixed metaphor?)<br><br>I've found an 80/20 principle approach quite useful on occasion...to get to the real core projects that will make a difference, and keep an overview of what is really important.</div>

<div class="content">Absolutely Nicole.  Being an employee, rather than self-employed or freelance, makes this very much the case.  I'm allocated cases (I'm a lawyer for a local authority), and they duly go on the list, at a rate much faster than I can actually deal with them.  My colleagues are equally busy so I can't ask for stuff to be reallocated to someone else, and there is an expectation that all these tasks are essential and have to be done.  I agree AF/AF2 are great, but there's not a system on earth than can deal with just having too much to do.  And in the present economic climate, what chance of leaving to do something else?</div>

<div class="content">Oooooh  yes, <br><br>That's one of the benefits I found with DIT - the audit procedure (but for me AF2 is working well at the moment). <br><br>I find it useful to monitor and keep upto date the hard landscape in my diary, i.e. planned meetings, appointments etc - including times when I can't do work AF2 like days out with my kids. This at least gives me a realistic picture of the discretionary time available to me. If I start to feel that I'm not getting through my tasks adequately then I block out some time that will not be filled by other appointments or meetings .</div>

<div class="content">Nicole, esp. with AF2 I make this experience. But as you  expressed it rightly: AF and AF2 make us aware of this fact, but they are not to blame for it.<br>But maybe we can blame Mark? It's always good to have a scapegoat... ;-))</div>

<div class="content">Nicole:<br><br>I call it the "Menu of Life". If you go into a fancy restaurant with a 40 page menu, you may spend a lot of time making up your mind what to eat, but you will only end up with two or three courses. Of course you can always come back the next day and have another set of choices.<br><br>In life we have an infinitely large menu and we try to eat the lot in one meal!</div>

<div class="content">The "Menu of Life" analogy is nice!. What happens when I go to a favorite restaurant repeatedly, I end up choosing from a small selection of their (sometimes huge) menu.  I just flip quickly through certain pages, and spend more time looking only at specific pages, once I know from previous visits what's on there.  As far as I'm concerned, they could drop a significant part of their menu.  Maybe I'll have to do that with some of my commitments also, knowing that AF helps me decide which commitments that should be...</div>

<div class="content">Same for me.  I decided to make a short list of everything taking up my time (including a couple of hobbies) and was surprised when it turned into a long list. I'm going to complete a few projects, say no for awhile and maintain this list. I don't have to tell this crowd how helpful keeping an eye on the big picture can/will be.</div>

<div class="content">As an employee it is difficult to push back against too much workload.  2 suggestions:<br><br>1. push your boss to choose what he wants doing over the next 2/3 days;<br><br>2. accept that a fast grade C is all you can hope for, forget going for the A - there isn't time.</div>
