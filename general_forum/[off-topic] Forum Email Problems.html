<div class="content">Hi guys,<br><br>Sorry to spam the "General" forum, but I'm not sure where else to put this...<br><br>I made a posting to the "FV" forum, and clicked on the "Notify me of follow-up comments via email" checkbox so that I would receive a notification when a reply was posted.  But I'm now receiving an email for *every* new posting to the FV forum, not just replies to my original posting.  Worse, I can't seem to turn the notifications off, because I don't need to log in any more and so there's no way of identifying myself as the author of the original posting.  My in-box is filling up with dozens of unwanted notifications, and I can't seem to turn them off -- I could set up an email filter to automatically delete any forum emails, but surely there's a better way.<br><br>Is this a bug, or have I missed something obvious?<br><br>Thanks,<br><br> - Erik.</div>

<div class="content">Erik:<br><br>You can access your account by using the Log-In box at the bottom of the right-hand margin.<br><br>Having never used it myself, I don't know the answer to your getting copies of all comments and not just the ones on the one thread. I'll investigate.</div>

<div class="content">P.S. Asking a legitimate question is not spamming the forum.</div>

<div class="content">Erik,<br><br>I had this problem yesterday.  I posted two threads in quick succession and ticked the Notify boxes on each.  I got flooded with about 100 emails from those and other threads in the FV forum.  I think you can just click on the link in one of the emails and then tick an Unsubscribe box on the page that comes up in the browser. I had to do it twice, I think because I posted twice with the Notify box checked.  I clicked on the link a third time, and the system said I was no longer subscribed.  The email flood subsided shortly afterward.  Seems like a bug.<br><br>Good luck,</div>

<div class="content">It seems to working fine for me, but it's possible that somehow you have been subscribed to the Comments stream - which is something that a registered member of the site can choose to receive. You can turn it off by logging in to your account (the log-in link is at the bottom of the right margin).<br><br>Btw the follow up comment emails I received had an unsubscribe link at the bottom.</div>

<div class="content"><<Btw the follow up comment emails I received had an unsubscribe link at the bottom. >><br><br>Aha -- thank you, Mark.  That was the thing I hadn't noticed.  By following those links, I was able to unsubscribe fine.<br><br>Still strange that I was receiving *all* forum comments, not just for the one thread I had subscribed to.  That's probably a bug in SquareSpace's server -- nothing to do with you.  And now that I've unsubscribed, the problem has gone away.<br><br>Thanks!<br><br> - Erik.</div>
