<div class="content">Any suggestions for switching over when you fill a notebook?  Obviously don't want to copy over the half finished pages, but don't like switching back & forth between notebooks either...</div>

<div class="content">Hi Kathy, <br>This happened to me a couple of weeks ago.  I worked with the 2 books, and got rid of the older, active pages at a much more rapid rate than normal just because I wanted to switch completely over to my new book, I think.  <br><br>Here's advice from other people (and Mark):<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/645666" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/645666</a></div>

<div class="content">Kathy: I may have to do this soon as my first book is falling apart. I am thinking of writing a line thus:<br><br>(completed tasks)<br><br>in the new book to represent any contiguous group of completed tasks from the old book. This would preserve the logic for dismissals, but mean (hopefully) not too much copying over is needed.</div>

<div class="content">Copying is a good opportunity to review and reword tasks.</div>

<div class="content">With just a few pages left, I have started transferring to a new book. In addition to what I said above one needs to add dotted lines appropriately to mark the pagebreaks (since the original post above AF2 has become RAF, so we now need that additional factor).<br><br>This seems to be quite a significant job which interrupts the flow for me, I am having second thoughts about paper.<br><br>It looks like I need a something like a filofax. I want to keep the convenience of spiral-type binding, so I can turn the pages a full 180 degrees. I also like a pocketable form factor (useful on hot days!) with the binding at the top rather than the left - so that I can read two full page lengths top to bottom and count it as one page. And if it is compatible with standard two hole punched paper, it might keep me from running back to the PDA and saying "all is forgiven"!<br><br>So as I do the transfer little and often to the new book, can anyone recommend an appropriate product for me?</div>

<div class="content">Laurence,<br><br>Some people use the "Circa" / "Rolabind" books.  Levenger (search the web) offers a starter kit for $40 with a $40 gift certificate so it is essentially free (except for shipping).  They make a 3x5 format with "rings" at the top and a pen loop.  They also make some pages (lines, squares, TO DO list, Project List) on card stock.  However, in order to use your own printed pages and forms, you need to buy their rather expensive punch.  (They do not use a ring binder arrangement (with closed holes) but keep the holes open a bit so you can "tear" the pages out and "press" them back in elsewhere.  It comes in several other form factors from letter size (8x11) down to an impossibly small 1x2 inch (or something like that) size.<br><br>The upside is that you can manage pages as you like ... keeping your book lean and mean.  The downside is that it is more fussing and expense.<br><br>One thing you might consider is simply bagging all the overhead of marking lines and such.  Just bite the bullet and realize you are, in essence, starting from scratch and just copy over only KEY items and let the list evolve fresh.  It is not as awful as it sounds and it is a way of purging a lot of things quickly and getting you moving quickly again.  Just a thought.  (Basically, it is what you'd have to do if you lost your book!)</div>

<div class="content">Mike,<br><br>Excellent ideas.<br><br>By the way, is the Circa starter kit you mentioned the one with a $40 gift card included or is there another offer with $40 *off* so that you only have to pay shipping and handling?<br><br>Thanks,<br>Joseph</div>

<div class="content">Since 23 July, I have been using two notebooks. I thought that this would increase my motivation to get the old one closed out. <br><br>It takes up more room on my desk, but I am surviving.</div>

<div class="content">I have moved to a new book now, but the process was so arduous I am not going to do it again. Hopefully the book I chose will allow me to pull apart the binding slightly to add new pages, etc. It is the Sainsbury's 99p A7 notepad (for those in Blighty).<br><br>I bought two of them so I shall have the appropriate spare sheets next time the book fills up.<br><br>Interesting no matter what implementation we choose we run up against technological issues in the end, whether electronic or from the bark of a tree.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Joseph,<br><br>They are not very sensible in the way they name things, but here is the link:<br><br><a href="http://www.levenger.com/PAGETEMPLATES/PRODUCT/Product.asp?Params=category=326-339|level=2-3|pageid=5961" rel="nofollow">http://www.levenger.com/PAGETEMPLATES/PRODUCT/Product.asp?Params=category=326-339|level=2-3|pageid=5961</a><br><br>One has to wonder if you can buy more than one of those ... or one every now and again.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">BTW, I found it helps to get the measurements of the various sizes and compare them to what you have used in the past.  Letter and 3x5 are kind of obvious, but the "Compact" and "Junior" are close to the same size and of slightly different form factors.  3x5 is my style as I work out of my pocket, but the "Compact" is not a bad size either.  "Junior" is more for those who like to write on a surface, I guess.  <br><br>The thing that Rolabind (the manufacturer) got right is having the rings spaced the same way for all sized.  So it is possible to pull out a 3x5 sheet and pop it into your Compact binder.  Lots of nice things you can do if you're of a mind to experiment.</div>

<div class="content">I've just gone with working from two notebooks, and am now down to just one page left in the old notebook.  Hasn't really bothered me at all.  And like Moises, I'm finding there is an increased motivation & satisfaction with finishing off each page in the old notebook.</div>
