<div class="content">Hello Mark and others,<br>I am curious as to how I should use DIT to memorize a large quantity of information over several weeks.  I can boil my concerns down to two major areas:  one, do I make this my primary initiative and do this each morning or should I dedicate a block of time at some other point as is suggested for learning a foreign language in DIT book?  <br>Second, the resistance busters are helpful, such as setting an alarm and basically working 5 min then break 5 min then work 10 min, then break 5 min, etc.  A problem is that by breaking 5 min and taking on new info in the break times, it sort of messes with my recall.  Anyway, thoughts appreciated, TK</div>

<div class="content">Generally speaking, learning a subject in this way is best treated as a "continuing project" and given a dedicated block of time.<br><br>It does though rather depend on exactly what sort of information you are learning. Does this project consist of basically one type of action repeated over and over again, like learning language vocabulary or learning a part in a play? Or is it more like studying a subject in which you would have several different types of actions, i.e. reading, research, exercises, essays, rote learning, etc?</div>

<div class="content">It is for graduate school, so it's four distinctive classes with a cumulative test in each at the end.  The subject matter for each is similar but to prepare the information must be applied, so I do exercises, write out practice essays, answer multiple choice questions in each.  Is that helpful?</div>

<div class="content">I realise that one further question I should have asked you is whether you are studying this full-time or having to fit it into a full day's work on other things.<br><br>If the latter, then you should definitely set aside a dedicated block of time each day (or possibly two). If the former then set your day up like a school timetable and work on specific subjects for a set length of time. <br><br>Either way, I would give yourself targets each day and treat the targets as a Will Do list.<br><br>If you want to use the timed bursts technique, then experiment with what length of burst suits you best. Some people find working in bursts of say 40 minutes with a 5 minute gap suits them very well. That fits the school timetable quite neatly too.</div>

<div class="content">Greetings Mark, it is full-time, I really liked the Targets idea and will use it.  Have a great rest of the week, TK</div>
