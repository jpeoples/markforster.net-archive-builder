<div class="content">As a new parent and entrepreneur, I find it  difficult to implement any system. I'm fine for an hour or two (honeymoon phase) and then fall back on doing whatever feels right (translate: NOT moving my projects forward). <br><br>Question(s): <br>How often do you use SF? Do you do reach for your list, all day, in between tasks? I'd imagine that takes incredible discipline, and a somewhat structured environment. Do you commit to using SF during a specified time of the  day? A certain amount of hours per day? <br><br>Thanks for the support.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Avrum: <br><br>We have two young boys & it's felt incredibly difficult at times to get anything done! Of course lots *is* getting done, like care giving, it's just likely to not get written down. It seems there's much reaction to seemingly urgent stuff with children. <br><br>I've found it helpful to have set times when I use my task management system, i.e. at work & when the kids are in bed. Otherwise I just end up multi tasking (badly) get frustrated & achieve very little. <br><br>Best of luck, and take it easy!</div>

<div class="content">avrum:<br><br>I use my list all the time - literally from the time I get up to the time I go to bed. I've found it to be incredibly strong and resilient in all circumstances. It worked perfectly for me when I had children and grandchild around, when I was testing out the system, when I was ill over the last week, and is still working perfectly now I am getting moving again. I note by the way that both you and leon get frustrated and achieve very little precisely when you are not using the system!</div>

<div class="content"><<I use my list all the time - literally from the time I get up to the time I go to bed.>><br><br>Mark - <br><br>I'm having a hard time visualizing the following scenario: <br><br>"You enter your home after shopping, and your grandchild is crying and/or wanting your attention. You say: "Give me a few minutes while I scan my list...." You enter: "Play with grandchild". Scan, scan, scan. A few minutes later, grandchild throwing a tantrum, your intuition tells you to "play with grandchild".<br><br>I'm quite serious, is that how you work the system? <br><br>What about cooking? Eating? Do you add that to your list as well? If you do all the above, is there ANYTHING you don't add to your list? <br><br>I''m asking in earnest.</div>

<div class="content">Just my guess (as parent of two), "playing with crying child" would be covered by the "common sense" rule--if it needs to be done now, do it now.<br><br>On the other hand, "entertaining a not-crying child" might very well allow for scanning the list. I'm still new at this, but I do put things on the list that I want to do with my kids.<br><br>The downside is, it feels like I want a separate list for "kid time"--because I know I won't be balancing my checkbook or calling clients; I'll be playing checkers or printing  out coloring pages--so strictly following the list would mean unfair page dismissals.</div>

<div class="content">I don't know what Mark does.  I don't use the list all the time.  Basically I run SF except for:<br>- routine stuff [ I do every day same time ]<br>- working with people on a big project<br>- socializing<br>- R&R<br><br>But when I am using SF, if a customer comes in and asks for my attention, (the equivalent of a grandchild crying when you walk in the door), I immediately pay attention to the customer.  If the need is anything more complex than handing him an envelope he's waiting for, I pull out my notebook and record what must be done.<br><br>So interruptions mean I respond to the interruption.  I take immediate action as required.  I then make a note for further action required, then return to operating the system.<br><br>It's an open question how two people operating an SF list can ever get together if interruptions aren't allowed.  "Play with grandchild" comes up, so you go over to play, and the grandchild says "sorry, Play with grandfather is not on this page."  Fortunately, SF alllows for urgent stuff and the kid can pencil you in right away :-)</div>

<div class="content">"I don't know what Mark does."<br><br>Mark said: <br><br>"I use my list all the time - literally from the time I get up to the time I go to bed."<br><br>I would like Mark to qualify how this plays out in the real world. My curiosity stems from my inability to use exceptions and qualifiers, while ensuring I can trust myself to use the system with any regularity. Worse, one qualifier (or hack to the rules) leads to another, creating the following rationalization:<br><br>"Hey, i got a few things done without the list... perhaps all this overhead (system) is a waste of time."<br><br>And then I'm back to square 1.</div>

<div class="content">If you look at Mark's record of a day with AF4, you get a good feel of what goes on his lists. This includes breaks, eating, doing the dishes after meals, pretty much everything.<br><br>Though I suspect a grandchild requiring attention might fall within the common sense rule.</div>

<div class="content">And there's really no reason why you can't carry your complete SF in your pocket: <br><a href="http://screencast.com/t/U2qrizYIo" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://screencast.com/t/U2qrizYIo</a><br><br>(Spot the misread rule!)<br><br>I tend to go manual when I'm at home for a couple of days. This helps me understand the system, as well as keeping me away from the machine.</div>

<div class="content">Hi avrum,<br><br>My statement "I don't know what Mark does" was intended to relate to your question of how to deal with things that come up (like children); not how long he runs the system.  (It somehow jumped out of place.)<br><br>Responding to an event is not a "hack to the rules", nor getting away from the system.  It's merely a fact of life.  Let me put it another way:<br><br>When something immediate and important comes up, that something wasn't in your system, but it must be done now.  It takes precedence and automatically becomes the thing you decide to do.  <br><br>This doesn't mean the system is bad or unnecessary.  Point of fact, that situation didn't require a system, and wouldn't have been helped by the presence of a system.  <br><br>A system is a tool to help you decide what to do.  When your child falls down, you KNOW what to do.  Afterward, you're unsure of what to do, so bring the system back online.</div>

I only put meals on the list when I am eating on my own because I have a tendency to forget about them if I don't.. On the other hand I always put doing the dishes on the list.<br><br>As a general rule you don't need to put anything on the list which you would do anyway.<br><br><< Though I suspect a grandchild requiring attention might fall within the common sense rule. >><br><br>Not really. <br><br>For a start the common-sense rule doesn't exist in SF because it's capable of handling urgent tasks within the system.<br><br> But more importantly anything requiring immediate action (i.e. drop whatever you're doing and get on with it), isn't a subject for time management at all. <br><br>You don't need a time management system to leave a burning building, help a child in distress, or deal with the next customer. In fact it would get in the way.<br><br>I deal with this question extensively in Chapter Six of Do It Tomorrow.</div>

<div class="content">Avrum,<br><br>One trick you can employee when wondering what goes into a system and what does not; is to keep a log of random stuff you do. So you can identify things you neglect and things you do without prompting.<br><br>I know where you are coming from. Not sure if it is the same scenario, but I work from home and my 4 month old daughter is here with me all day. I take  10-40 phones calls inbound a day, coordinate the 6 year old when he gets home from school, process abbot 200 emails a day,  juggle the housework and fix all the problems reported via the aforementioned emails and calls; and run the business at the same time. It gets hectic. <br><br>However what you find as you evolve as a parent and entrepreneur is that some things take care of themselves and other things develop a rhythm, and a lot of stuff is not urgent unless you avoid it.<br><br>So if you are using super focus, follow the rules. But give yourself permission to do stuff off list as you think of it and it’s a NOW item. Then log; anytime you do something that was not on the SF list. When you write it down, note the day and time. Aka Monday 2pm don't worry about the date just the day.<br><br>Do this for two weeks to gather data to review. I’m sure you will have some of those holy crap moments where the kid and the phone and the business will explode at the same time, just roll with it and keep the log. If you done something and it wasn’t on the list; if it was routine/repeating and you got to it LATE then highlight it as well.<br><br>After two weeks if you sit-down and look through the log you will discover you have natural routines and rhythms; look for patterns you can leverage. If there is stuff that should be on your SF list then put it on the list; usually this will be things you wound up doing late because you put them off or you don’t have an external reminder to do it. Other Stuff you will do on routine and you don't need them on the list because you can just do them...<br><br>The trick here is to learn what things you can be counted on to do without help; and then look for ways to leverage them to do things you forget to do. It’s called “chunking” and it’s powerful as heck for routines.<br><br>I can give you some simple and silly examples from my life to  illustrate. <br><br>The two things I always forget to do are (1) make coffee (2) set the dinner table and get dinner started on time. These are the curse of the self-employed stay up too late; work from home entrepreneur.<br><br>So to solve those problem I looked fore things I do reliably….<br><br>Here’s my solution:<br><br>1. Each morning I get up and go to the kitchen and I prep 4 bottles of formula. While I’m doing that I now make coffee. I do these at the same time because they require the same spot in the kitchen and similar supplies (water, sink, and towel to clean spillage). In my little cartoon world, I have to make the bottles in the morning first thing. If I fail to do this task. Later in the day if I am swamped and the baby freaks out while I am on the phone with a client I’m in a pickle. I won't have a bottle to shut her down and she will scream non-stop and the customer, her and I will all be upset by the situation. A few experiences with that scenario were sufficient motivation to make me very reliable at bottle prep in them morning. Now I make coffee at the same time because I want / need coffee and it not a priority item, but if I make it with the bottles it always gets done and not forgotten. So I have paired and urgent todo with a non-urgent and both get done everyday. This works because no matter how tired I am when I get up; my brain says YO STUPID make the bottles or suffer. Experience has taught me that the suffer part is not fun.<br><br>2. Each afternoon my son has to study spelling words because he's six and that part of his schoolwork. I make him read the words out loud while he does this. As an engaged parent I have to listen and guide him. So for thirty minutes nothing on the computer is looked at and the phone goes to voicemail regardless (this is like my mini lunch hour). Now while he does this I need to listen and encourage him, but I don't need to see what is happening it’s all verbal. So while he does this, I set the kitchen table for dinner and get the food out and stage all the cooking. I can do all that and coach him through his spelling with my ears and voice. Again his homework is urgent the table setting is not, but both can be-combined as a daily task and I can be assured both get done. His nature routine and rhythm keeps me on task with a routine chore that I use to forget.<br><br>Now neither of these dual tasks are on my SF list. They now happen because they became habit and they recur in a predictable manner. Through logging what I was doing OFFLIST every day I was able to step back and look for patterns when the heat and pressure weren’t on me. This can be a powerful trick. <br><br>I understand my world is very strange to many office workers who just went, what the heck, that is so weird and not applicable to me; but I worked in an office for 20 years. I learned the trick in that environment and just brought it forward with me to my current situation.  A log of what you do, that wasn’t planned, can illuminate some very interesting things. If you use paper to log it; it is really a low friction task and easy to do.<br><br>In my case I no longer have a commute to make and I don't take an hour lunch break. But since I work from home I have to maximize all my time shifting from home to work and back and avoid the trap of hiding from one in the other. If I’m not efficient then I will ALWAYS be working and the house will be a disaster and I will have ZERO down time. So I have learned to allocate the commute time saved and the lunchtime saved to routine things that I can do to keep the house running smooth and the children cared for. Chunking helps me combine some work related things with household things.<br><br>I have other weird examples but you get the point.</div>

I enjoy reading how people tackle their days and the challenges they face and how they get over them - now can anyone suggest how I can stop my dog(s) barking when I am scheduled to run webinars?  Our Jack Russell is a very noisy little thing, and the labrador is starting to learn some bad habits!!</div>
