<div class="content">I tried it a bit.....looks promising.<br>Since I am constantly breaking the rules now, I might give this a try to be forced to use the rules....<br><br>BTW in the instructions it states:<br># Items in the "backlog" get upgraded to essential if you see them twice without doing anything about them. <br><br>This statement is not correct since each item in the backlog can be seen many times without going "essential".<br>It should probably be something like this:<br><br>All items in the "backlog" get upgraded to "essential" if you go through the "backlog" without taking action on at least one item.<br><br>You may also change the name from "backlog" to '"closed list" or something else...see the discussions elsewhere on this forum...<br><br><br>Regards,<br>Clouds</div>

<div class="content">I started doing my own application a few days ago  :-(<br><br>I guess two (three?) autofocus web applications are a bit too much. I think I'll just drop it.</div>

<div class="content">Like I always say, the more the merrier. I'm still working on the successor to autofocus.cc, but it will still be a while. This one looks nice.</div>

<div class="content">Jeff,<br><br>Nice. I would be slightly more severe with the "essential" category. On pressing "next" on an open, essential task, I'd put in a warning message saying "this task will now be closed. Add a new action if necessary"  and close automatically.<br><br>Put it on the iPhone with a link to MS Outlook Tasks and I'll buy it!!<br><br>All budding developers:<br><br>All I want is:<br><br>- an iPhone App WITH<br>- a sync to MS Outlook tasks (or something else on the desktop that accepts dragged Outlook items)<br>- the ability to sort by date modified (at a pinch, date created would be OK)<br>- ASCENDING<br>- the ability to mark the current task for action (or something like Jeff's next action)<br><br>So far, the closest I've got is ToodleDo, which irritatingly sorts in order of increasing time within decreasing date. And has an unexpectedly clunky sync.<br><br>Anyone got anything better?</div>

<div class="content">Looks good but agree with comments of Clouds above.</div>

<div class="content">I'm intrigued by the idea of making the "essential" list more "severe." Regarding Clouds' comments above, I have made the change to the instructions page, but changing all instances of backlog to "closed" would be more complicated. I'll consider it.<br><br>Thanks for the feedback! The site already has a few modifications in place for viewing on a handheld device, but I doubt I'll be able to do anything with Outlook Sync. That would require COM programming on Windows, however, if Outlook can send tasks by email, I could add a feature to have my web app listen to a special email address and post any tasks sent to it to your active list.</div>

<div class="content">Jeff,<br><br>Thanks for thinking about the essential list processing. While I think about it, I'm not sure that "essential" is quite the right term. Maybe something like "Act now or drop"?<br><br>As for the instructions, it's actually quite hard to come up with a short description of when you move from "closed" to essential. Clouds' suggestion isn't quite right. Somehow you need to work in the fact that it's only if you strike out on the first pass from the open list.<br><br>To be honest, I wasn't expecting that you would be able to sync to Outlook, so this is a theoretical exercise for me, I'm afraid. (Then I saw that Pocket Informant had something in the works...). Thanks for thinking about what could be done, though. The mail workaround is exactly the sort of thing that looks fine in theory, but in practice wouldn't get done consistently (by me: others may be more disciplined). And I do need a two way sync.<br><br>So if anyone has found an iPhone app that:<br>- syncs to Outlook (2 way)<br>- can sort by modified or created date ascending<br>- can flag the current task<br>i'd love to hear...</div>
