<div class="content">The snapshot from this morning was triggered by me, I'm not sure why it's not working correctly. I'll try to make sure all posts get preserved.</div>

<div class="content">There must be a good way to move forward, both in preserving Mark’s original content and continuing our shared discussions.<br><br>Does anyone have suggestions? I’ve heard good things about Discord, but I’d hate to lose the existing material or the spirit of ongoing reflection and development that’s grown here.</div>

<div class="content">Thomas, <br><br>I have wondered this too.  <br><br>Although we have Mark Forster's books, there is information here on this website that is not covered in any of the books. None of the books contain any Long List systems - Autofocus and its variants, Simple Scanning, Final Version and variants.  Other than the 5T no list method which is described in the Secrets book, none of the no-list methods are in the books, but described here. I would think that at least the instructions to all of these should be preserved.</div>

<div class="content">This would be good to preserve:<br><br>Review of the systems<br><a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/category/review-of-systems" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/category/review-of-systems</a><br><br>There is a thread on the General Forum started by Aaron Hsu on a<br>"A short history and summary of Mark Forster's TMS research"<br><br>I inputed Aaron's posts into ChatGPT, and asked it to analyze and compare Mark Forster's systems, and had a lengthy chat on ChatGPT to refine the answers, and added that to the thread.</div>

<div class="content">I created the discord server originally as a fallback in case this website goes down without notice. Now that we have notice, I added a general discussion forum over there. Though it's probably worth discussing whether Discord is the best replacement option.<br><br>I have also locally backed up all relevant pages of this website. I uploaded an earlier, incomplete dump to archive.org, but I will update/replace that with the newest content.<br><br>I use ArchiveBox for this, which uses multiple approaches to attempt to archive a webpage. One of them is to request the Wayback Machine to save a copy. This seems to be not working reliably right now, but I do have copies of all blog articles, forum posts and other pages on my local computer, in the forms of screenshots, PDF exports, text extractions and plain copies of the HTML. I will get a full archive published one way or the other.</div>
