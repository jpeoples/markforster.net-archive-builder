<div class="content">Folks - <br><br>Would anyone be interested in Skype call - recorded - to discuss how we use Mark's systems, what works, what doesn't. etc. I'd be willing to host and record the call.</div>

<div class="content">I'm back Avrum and I'd be interested. I'm a lot more sensitive and appreciative of the challenges inherent in living one's vision having made some major transitions. Let me know if something develops and what would work for you. Bev P</div>

<div class="content">Ok Bev - it's the two of us. I believe we've used skype before. So we need to figure out a time to record the call. My goal(s) for this call are to answer the following questions: <br>* What system do you use<br>* What problem were/are you hoping to solve with said system<br>* What is working<br>* What is not or missing<br>* What processes or habits, regardless of system, have you used to produce results you're proud of. <br><br>I will answer these questions as well. The conversation will be uploaded to youtube, and the link posted here.</div>

<div class="content">As mentioned directly to Avrum, I'm very interested in discussing this but gun shy about recording it for YouTube. If there's another way to have the conversation and select after, what gets put in written form to share with the DF, I would be interested in participating. I have lots of resources to share and would like to continue to explore systems for time management/accomplishing dream.</div>
