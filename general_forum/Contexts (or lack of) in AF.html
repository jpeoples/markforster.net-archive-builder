<div class="content">I'm using AF4, and have come up against a bit of a snag (but this I think would apply to all versions of AF).<br><br>I have two separate lists, one for work and one for home. My work list works great, but at home sometimes I have the situation where I can't do any items in my backlog at the point when I'm looking through them - e.g. the only items left are phone calls, but it's too early/late, or I'm at home and need to be out in town to do this item etc.<br><br>But these are still current items so it doesn't seem right to dismiss them. What do you do in this situation - leave them undone and break the rules, or move them to the Active List without working on them, or what?</div>

<div class="content">Don't worry so much about the rules.  If you can't do a task now because of time or place, and that is the only reason you cant do it ... just leave it be and catch it next time around.</div>

<div class="content">Usually I schedule that kind of items, e.g. private phone calls to do at the office and errands to do when I drive home in the evening.</div>

<div class="content">The rule of AF4 is that when you are done everything in the closed list, the open list becomes the closed list, and you start a new open list.  The point is to be focusing work on the backlog, so everything moves forward.  If you aren't working on your backlog, that ruins the process.  <br><br>Instead, dismiss your list, make a new closed list, and re-enter your "wrong-context" items in the open list.  Also consider if you need to do something to enter that other context in timely fashion.  If that thing is "buy milk", maybe put a note by the door so you'll do it when you next go out.</div>

<div class="content">Anton:<br><br>In the sort of situation you describe, it's usually best to keep a separate list of phone calls and schedule it for a time when you know you are going to be able to make the calls.<br><br>Otherwise Alan is correct. If you can't or won't do any tasks in the Backlog, then you should dismiss all the remaining tasks as per the rules. You are allowed to re-enter them immediately into the Active list.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, that makes sense to me and I'll follow the rules as you say.<br><br>In the short time I've been using AF I've really noticed that I'm noticeably less effective the more I stray from the rules! Thanks Mark for such a great system.</div>
