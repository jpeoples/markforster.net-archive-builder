<div class="content">First off thank you Mark for this great opportunity and for all you have done so far (thru your books) helping me to achieve my goals.<br><br>As an artist I don't really have pressing deadlines. I get to choose what I want to do when I want to do it BUT the rest of my life, eg family home etc does have demands on me. <br><br>I think my problem is going to be that if I have an art project I'm doing I can't stop and I don't want to stop. <br>So hours later I'm starting to reason with myself that now it's too late for lunch and if I just wait till tea time I won't have to take time cooking twice. <br><br>I love being involved in the project while it's moving forward BUT then after a couple of days my life has totally collapsed with none of the things done that I "should" have done eg sleeping, returning emails, clean house, etc etc. I now feel totally out of control and feel like giving up<br><br>If I pick a job on each page I'm a bit worried that each page will get a job done for 5 mins so that I can quickly get back to the page with my art on it and then that will be it for the day?<br><br>So is there an upper time limit to the jobs?<br><br>I'm slowly reading all the discussions so I'm sorry if this a repeat but I thought I'd put it out there while I was in the forum today.<br><br>Thank you also for all the great discussions even the ones where people are finding it hard because as others offer advise I'm also learning new ideas. Thanks alot<br></div>

<div class="content">Margherita:<br><br>Sounds like you've got the opposite problem to most people!<br><br>I don't know enough about you to be able to answer this question myself, but is the fact that you are leaping ahead with your art projects telling you something? How were you doing before with your art - did you have the same problem before or was  your art languishing a bit? Maybe this is the crest of a wave that you should be riding for a bit.<br><br>However if you feel you do need to limit it, then you can simply set yourself an upper limit, e.g. " I will work on this for not more than an hour", then re-enter the task at the end of the list.<br><br>Another way is to take the art projects off the list altogether and have a set period each day during which you work on your art and nothing else. Out of that time, you can do anything except work on your art.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks mark for your input.<br>My first post was about how I normally work... I do nothing (aahh guilt) then an idea hits and I obsessively  work on it. <br>Now I can confess that I had started writing the list of all the things I wanted to do and had to do BUT had not actually started AF ing it.<br><br>So.. I wrote the above yesterday...and because of time zone difference..I'm at the other end of the planet...there were no replies telling me what to do.<br>So... I started AF ing my list... wow what a huge change<br><br>So far I have done as much if not more art than usual AND I have ticked off 16 other activities.<br><br>When journalling this morning I realised that by doing AF, art was always on the list (as I kept adding it to the end as I finished a session) and that previously working obsessively was because I was scared that if and when I stopped, I would procrastinate about getting to the studio and it may be days before I started again. <br><br>With AF I worked with art 4 times yesterday and I also stopped with no interuption of the flow of creativity. That was so freeing.<br><br>I also stopped.. naturally.. because as I used AF about "wanting" to do something I also "heard" my body saying it wanted to stop. thru stfness from sitting too long, hunger or just wanting to do something else. (signs that I usually worked on thru)<br>And I felt no hesitation about letting the art go and moving on to something else, which as I realised when writing this morning, I had been hanging on to thru fear, not thru creativity.<br><br>I think AF is going to be a great addition to my life.<br>Thank you again<br><br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Margherita<br><br>That's a really encouraging post.  Like you I can sometimes get carried away and spend hours on something but that has'nt been happening for a while because my creativity had become somewhat squashed by all my "stuff".  I can already see how AF is freeing up my thought processes so that my creativity is flowing again and your report of  your experiences is really helpful.  I haven't yet "felt" prompted to do much on the tasks that I do sometimes get carried away by but I'm sure AF will handle them.  Best of luck!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark and others<br><br>What do you do about this dreaded addiction to that rather too interesting internet beastie called Mark Forster's Discussion Forum?<br><br>I come to check email and as 'check MF forum' is usually next to 'check email' on my list I think "oh, I'll just have a quick look". Normally with something I wanted to keep a lid on how long I spend on it, I would use a timer but with this I don't think about it until it's too late!!!<br><br>This session has just lasted 2 HOURS!!!!!!!!!!!</div>

<div class="content">The interesting thing about being addicted to the MF Discussion forum, and spending several hours per day scouring the posts, is that in the 4 days of using AF, I have been more productive, felt more free with my creativity and been a better all around human being to my wife and animals than I have been in months. Possibly years. <br><br>I am grateful to you all and especially MF.  <br><br>Now every one go do some AFing!</div>

<div class="content">Another update.<br>haven't done any art , yesterday or today and it's almost tea time.<br>BUT I'm not worried or stressed.<br>AF is worth it for the relaxed state I seem to be staying in.<br><br>I have art on my list and I know what I'm going to do next and it feels quite natural to leave it till I "want" to do it.<br><br>Now I'm off to AF ((I think AF forum will have to be my first time limit activity haha))<br><br>Thanks to all of you for feedback</div>

<div class="content">Sorry,  I should add that I have achieved so much more with my art thru AF that this break has not put me behind or stopped the flow.<br>Actually I ""want"" to go make art now :)</div>

<div class="content">Very interesting post/s. For some months I've been going to the studio for two days a week - the other artists are usually absent or quiet, and there is no internet, and treat it as a 9 to 5 job, stopping only for lunch in the cafe across the road.<br><br>In fact I just finished reading Steven Pressfield's "The War of Art", about overcoming resistance, when Mark unleashed AF - this clever integration and refinement of his earlier ideas. So now, it appears, I must give in to resistance after all. But of course not while I am in the Studio!<br><br>(As an aside perhaps I can recommend the above book to fellow artists here, about resistance and many forms it can take.)<br><br>But I am facing the issue that has cropped up in a few threads already about different lists. In my case they are MLO outlines. I have one for the Studio, one for Home, and one for Office. The Office is at home, but I find it useful to set boundaries around what I do, and when. But some Studio related things can only be done at home. E.g. my binding machine and internet are at home/office, where I do my printing and sometimes internet research on recommended page layouts (I have my first performance coming up in a few months), while my composing and nearly all the creative work is done at the Studio miles away. I can do some internet research at the library near the Studio (if I get to it early enough!), but occasionally websites I need are blocked (they all need to be approved by some mysterious library authority).<br><br>Likewise my home/office tasks are mostly separate but sometimes could be on either list, if the computer is being recalcitrant (not uncommon), I might prefer not to wait till Monday to process "Fix computer". And of course, I want to "Check AF forum" in both Home and Office lists.<br><br>So this Venn diagram situation of partly interlocking lists is a spur to improving my set up. I'm only about half way through reading these posts (which seem to be expanding as fast as I can read them), but if this issue has been solved yet I'd love to know.<br><br>Generally I am getting different things done than usual, and - I think - being more productive.<br><br>And I really appreciate the creation of this forum which is, it seems to me, quite a work of art in itself.<br><br>Laurence</div>

<div class="content">Hi Laurence<br><br>I was in, what I now consider to be, the fortunate position of being in one location and it was natural for me to start with one list.  As I have gone along it has become a natural part of the system that some items have become additional lists.  Whereas it was clear that "separate location" lists were OK under AF, and actually recommended, I wasn't sure that my additional lists fitted into that category.  What I have realised though is that my "extra" lists are not compromising the system but are in fact the outworking of a change to my project structure.  By having my projects more clearly defined in a sort of AF way, those items can be added into my main AF list if appropriate, or treated independently within specific "project time".  At this point I am just letting those lists evolve naturally and will see where they go.<br><br>Laurence, that is just my personal experience, others may well have different views, but hope that may help ........</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Christine, that's very interesting and a new idea for me. So you would have maybe "Work on Project A" in your AF list, and then (if it is one of those projects which developed its own list) go to a separate AF-structured list for Project A? I like that fractal structure (I use it in art).<br><br>Meanwhile, after further thought, I think I want to keep my separate Home/Office/Studio lists separate, and will handle the issue by putting the same task on multiple lists when appropriate. If I have to see/respond to such a task more often, so be it.</div>

<div class="content">I think we will all find that we naturally evolve the number of location lists that are right for us as we go along and get more attuned to the system.  My gut feeling is that the number of lists I use may well change.  I would say just go with what feels right - if it needs tweaking for you later then you can easily do so.<br><br>My projects tend to vary, and I am also finding that some larger tasks I am treating as projects, as that enables me gain control over them.<br><br>In some cases I will just include the steps for a large task/project as they come to mind, eg "review project x", "set up system for project x", "liaise with Y re marketing plan for project x" etc.  In other cases I will just have "project z" and have separate files, lists etc for that project in their own location.  Projects naturally generate a lot of "stuff", be it files, boxes, notes, digital media etc and having a list of tasks to complete for that project helps keep me on track.  What I am finding is that I am now treating those lists in an AF way rather than as standard To Do lists.<br><br>As a general rule I am finding that those projects which need to be progressed as urgent and important (e.g. do tax return) tend to gravitate towards the first example and have the steps listed on my main AF list.  Other less urgent projects (e.g. update my Family Tree) are more likely to end up on my list as just Family Tree (or Project Z),<br><br>Hope that clarifies a bit more.  You might find the following thread on projects to be of help also<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/625387" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/625387</a><br><br></div>
