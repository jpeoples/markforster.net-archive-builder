<div class="content">Do you use one list for private and work actions? It looks like it's better to loop through home related tasks when at home or during weekend.</div>

<div class="content">My recommendation is to use a separate list for each location. However this obviously needs to be adapted for each person's individual circumstances.</div>

<div class="content">How else would you do it then? It's easy enough to have two files if you want to do it electronically.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Eugene,<br><br>There are several alternatives to using two notebooks.<br><br>For example:<br>- Use the front of the book for one location.  Flip the book over and use the back of the book for the other location.  Works well with graph paper notebooks.<br><br>- Use different colored pens for different locations (makes me dizzy personally, but might work for someone)<br><br>- Use left pages for one location, and right pages for another location<br><br>- Use the stalagmite / stalactite method (tasks for one location you write on the page from the top down, tasks for the other location you write on the page from bottom up, and let them meet in the middle).  Works great for AF1.  For AF4, it can get a little confusing exactly how to "draw the line" separating the Closed and Open Lists.  For me, I just started a new page and that solved the problem.<br><br>- If your locations aren't clearly distinct (e.g., sometimes working from home, sometimes in the office, so work and home are not always distinct), you could try mixing everything in one list.  This works great for me, but at times it can be distracting.</div>

<div class="content">I have two lists, one at home and one at work, and it works well. I seldom work from home and I seldom do home stuff from work (although I can as I work with computers). Bringing the notebook between home and work would not seem very useful to me (however, sometimes when I know I will work from home the next day I just take a couple of photos with my mobile camera in case I need to work the work list from home).</div>

<div class="content">There have been a few mentions on this forum of Reqall. Somehow I missed all of them until Mike brought it up quite recently. I loaded it on my Blackberry and have found it very useful for transmitting work ideas when I am home and home ideas when I am at work. It's a nifty, simple, app.</div>

I especially like that my wife is also using it so we can assign things to each other.</div>
