<div class="content">I have found myself recently using SF as an almost "purely" No-List/Catch-All hybrid, and it has been working remarkably well.  <br><br>I follow the rules as outlined here:<br><br><a href="../blog/Rules for SuperFocus.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2011/2/10/rules-for-superfocus.html</a><br><br>with the sole exception that I redefined unfinished items as "unfinished items for today"; that is, if a task was still unfinished but I determined that I had done enough for today, it is not rewritten on the next page's Column 2, but instead it is rewritten at the end of the list. <br><br>Now if I come to a new page and its Column 2 is empty or has only one item, I fill it to around 3-5 items that I want to do, not looking at the AF list.  I then check if there are identical items in Column 1 of that page, which I then cross out.  I then process the page per SF's rules.</div>
