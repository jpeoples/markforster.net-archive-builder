<div class="content">After my first week of trialing Autofocus, I am happy to find that I am more productive, mainly because I am less affected by distractions. But I can't yet trust the system to process items in a timely fashion.<br><br>When I read through the discussion forum, I see that my experience of Autofocus is massively different to a lot of people. Other people have talked about going through their list multiple times per day, but I have yet to complete a pass through the whole list. I currently have three pages of tasks, with 30 tasks per page. I have completed nearly all of the tasks on the first page. I am working through items on the second page, and recording new tasks on the third page. I find that I'm not moving past the second page because every uncompleted item on the page seems to 'stand out' to me.<br><br>I'm happy to spend the necessary time to do the tasks (more so than before I started using Autofocus), but I don't yet fully trust the system because I know there are more urgent items sitting out of sight on the last page and there is no trigger in the system to do anything about them in the near future.<br><br>I need help with:<br>a) How do I know to move on to the next page when uncompleted items on my current page still 'stand out' to me?<br>b) When do I review the uncompleted (but important) tasks on my fist page, considering that I have not yet worked my way through to the end of the list?<br><br>I would appreciate any comments that could help me.</div>

<div class="content">If you know something is urgent, then you should surely just do it immediately whatever page it is on.<br><br>If it is just more urgent, but doesn't need to be done straight away, then it will surely wait until you get to it.</div>

<div class="content">Simon I did this at first too.  At first just move on to the next page even though you see more stand outs. Soon you will feel a rhythm that will get you moving through pages quickly. I guess don't be too perfectionistic. Make sense?</div>

<div class="content">Are the items standing out because you consider them urgent and/or important or because they make you feel you want to do them?  If you are doing items that stand out from an urgent/important perspective you may be missing the intuitive side of AF and trying to work it from a rational perspective.<br><br>Just do the item/s that you "feel" like doing and move on.  You also do not need to complete the item you are working on - just work on it for as long as you feel is right at the time.  If the item is not completed cross it off and readd it to the bottom of the list.<br><br>Hope that is enough to make a bit more sense for you .........</div>

<div class="content">I'm struggling with the word "urgent" here. We have a saying here that one can BE busy, or MAKE him/herself busy. I echo Dm's comment.<br><br>E.g, I have a business, and my policy is to generally answer any incoming emails within 24 hours. Well, guess what, using AF an email that came in friday night did not get answered untill sunday morning. Not the end of the world, is it? If emails keep being answered "too late" I'd probably add a task like "Reviewing business email policy".<br><br>So, what I'm trying to say is that I trust the system entirely. Above that, I can't come up with very many tasks that can not wait one day longer.<br><br><br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the comments so far. They have been helpful and I look forward to receiving more comments as the sun touches other parts of the world. I'll provide a detailed response tomorrow.<br><br>Just to clarify, the items I have ambiguously referred to as 'urgent' are things like responding to emails, which I have traditionally tried to do within 24 hours or receiving them. The way I'm currently using Autofocus, I would not systematically get to see these items within 24 hours or even 48 hours. (For the kind of 'urgent' items that need immediate attention, I will of course apply common sense and action it immediately.)<br></div>

<div class="content">Hey Fred, it seems you posted your reply while I was writing mine, and we both addressed the same topic of 24 hour email turnaround! That's encouraging to hear that you can make it work in Autofocus. Cheers.</div>

<div class="content">Well, making it work / having it work is also a matter of perception. I can pretty good deal with let's say a 70% score in life. (I think the other 30% can be largely managed afterwards. Instead of endlessly trying to have things perfect from the start, this takes much less efford and feels much more natural.<br><br>AF makes me reach the 70% more easily, in other words it keeps me Focussed on the most important / urgend items.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Thanks for all the comments. I agree that I have been missing the intuitive side of Autofocus, and I will now change my approach.<br><br>I had been stuck on Mark's instruction that says "Don't move onto the next page until you complete a pass of the page without any item standing out."<br><br>My current criteria for an item "standing out" is that I'm willing and able to do the task right now. I will now change that criteria to "I know there's nothing else I'd rather be doing anywhere on my list".<br><br>I expect this will help me cycle through the pages quicker, and allow me to trust seeing items in a more timely manner.<br><br>Thanks again for your comments.</div>
