<div class="content">Hi Mark and others,<br><br>Well I've been on a time management journey since 5th January: DIT to AF, AF back to DIT, DIT back to AF, AF back to DIT (is anybody else dizzy too?). <br><br>Things I like about AF<br><br>Maturation of ideas, developing them into projects.<br>Creative thinking.<br>Breaking tasks down, to do 'little and often'.<br>Minimal overhead.<br>A place to write ideas and review / re-appraise regularly<br>Flexibility - when and how to do tasks<br>Bottom-up planning<br><br>Aspects of AF that do not work *for me*<br><br>Same day/ next day tasks: About half of my work consists of next day hard deadlines. The other half, that's gets done tommorrow (or progress made on) *looks good* when people start asking questions and (occasionally) look for a scape goat with lousy organizational skills. I personally cannot live with outstanding tasks that need closure ASAP.<br>I like to know when I've completed a day's work - AF start and finish times do not provide the same satisfaction for me as completing a day's closed list.<br>Related to the above: I don't feel on top of my work - I feel behind. As I don't particularly like my job any way this does not work for me.<br>AF *feels* like an open list to me - almost like GTD, which I'm really glad I escaped.<br>Lack of structure and routine.<br>Efficiency - my DIT set up runs much more smoothly *for my* cicumstances. <br><br>In Summary<br><br>I *personally* feel that AF does not suit my personality type: I prefer structure and order and feeling totally (as much as possible) on top of my work. In addition, I was starting to overwhelm myself again with tasks: The auditing feature in DIT helped combat me against this. I do not feel AF suits the political and cultural pressures within my organization, there is a lot of individual and departmental capital to be gained from evidence that work has been started, or done within 24 hours. <br><br>I think AF is an innovative and effective time management tool in the right circumstances, and thank you Mark for making it freely available and putting so much work into answering people's queries. <br><br> Along the journey I've realised how well DIT fits me and my current circumstances and also that I can have ideas for development within my 'will do' list and not neccessarily feel constrained by the structure. So I'm happy to say it's DIT for me!<br></div>
