<div class="content">I've been using AF for almost 3 weeks now with great success. I've been trying to follow as "pure" an implementation as I can. One general survey question at this point for you all: what types of symbols and notations are you associating with your task entries? <br><br>For my task entries, I put a square next to each one so that I can more easily see my dots when I work on tasks, check marks for finished tasks, "X" for cancelled tasks, and so on. I also put a date next to any task that has a deadline. I haven't foreseen any need (yet) to get any more detailed than that. But I am open to applying any tips and tricks that you may have.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Paul<br><br>It really is best to keep AF as simple as possible, with just crossing out or ticking off the completed tasks and highlighting dismissed tasks.  Mark suggests using a dot to notate the current task that you are working on and to then use that as the start point of the crossing out.  Personally I tick completed items rather than cross out but have found that any additional tags and notations can be more confusing.</div>

<div class="content">Paul,<br><br>I went down this road as well.  I put a box in front to check off, then I used the slash in the box for partially done, then I did the shaded circles thing for a short while.  I added tags for various things ... oh, I tried quite a few things and, in the end, I'm back to almost "native" AF.<br><br>The symbols in front cluttered things up for my eye and a simple, carefully drawn line completely through the item made it easiest to scan the list.  I found that I did not use the metrics I had added (dates so I could know when things had been done or how long they had been on the list) so I quit that.  The tags just messed things up completely.  I found that I was endlessly scanning the list and that  hurt the way the process was supposed to work.<br><br>Now I run AF "native" ;-)  The only changes that have lasted ... proved to be useful to me ... are:<br><br>- A Post-It in front for today's hot items,<br>- Special lists in the back of the book for:<br>- - Errands to run<br>- - Discuss with my wife<br>- - Tickler/waiting-for<br><br>I also move "dismissed" items to my projects list on the computer (I'm using OneNote for that purpose now).  Then I tear out the page and trash it.<br><br>I also gave up on various markers to find my place in the book.  I have only one for the active page.  I can find the other pages quickly enough that I don't bother wasting time moving markers around.<br><br>The single most compelling advantage of AF is its simplicity!  Anyway, that's my story ... I hope it saves you some grief.  ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike<br><br>Interesting that you've now banished most of your tags.  I only use them in my OneNote version but even there keep them to a minimum.<br><br>Like you I also found the page markers more of a hindrance - I used the movable plastic file envelope thingies that came with the notebook, and also used paperclips for a while but I forgot to move them more often than not.  They just didn't serve enough of a purpose to be useful.</div>

<div class="content">I'm pretty close to AF as written.  I put a box at the beginning of each task.  When I start the task I sometimes put a dot in the box, sometimes not.  When I'm done working on it, I fill in the box.  For me, this is easier to distinguish than tick-marks or lines through the whole item.  I note the date that the item was "touched" at the end of the line.  In my topmost margin, I note the date the page was opened, dismissed, and closed as well as its status and the dates that I have touched items on that page.<br><br>I have a scan of my book on flickr at this url:<br><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sarahmichelef/3404249811" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/sarahmichelef/3404249811</a><br></div>

<div class="content">I follow the system exactly as Mark directs except that I draw a triangle next to anything time senstive and color in the triangle so it will stand out (using the same pen that I use to write my lists.)  I jot the date at the end of the entry.<br><br>This helps things like "call Sally before next Wednesday" stand out.  Anything with a specific date/time like a doctor appointment or social date would go on my calendar.  My calendar squares are too small for many entries so this has worked well for me.</div>

<div class="content">The only deviation I do is that rather than extract my *urgent* tasks from my AF notebook (my manager all the sudden needs Q, R, S, T, U . . . done by the end of business), I put a star next to the items. <br><br>This keeps me in the notebook, which I like. It is still very handy if I need to jot something else down. It also allows me to see how often my notion of urgency clashes with that of those who rely upon me; the star means that my understanding of the urgency of the task is lower than what others think it is.<br><br>If the situation truly calls for my complete and uninterrupted attention. I take a larger post-it pad put the tasks on it. When I am finished I put those stars back into the notebook, again to track my workflow versus those who depend on me.</div>

<div class="content">That sounds like a good method Norman.  One of the issues with Time Management - with any system - is where other outside influences have demands on your time, particularly where those calls on your time are not necessarily able to be identified in advance.<br><br>AF is excellent at dealing with deadlined work but where you are suddenly required to deviate from your tasks at hand by the immediate you then lose the discretionery time element which AF needs.  It sounds as though AF is enabling you identify those occasions well and perhaps, armed with that information, you can put steps in place to minimise those interruptions.  The great thing though with AF is that, provided you have entered the tasks into the system, when you return to it after any period of "enforced non-discretionery time" you invariably have tasks that can be crossed off on your next cycle.</div>

<div class="content">Do you use - or have you considered using - any special symbols or notations for "blocked" or "waiting for" tasks?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Paul<br><br>Personally I resist the use of tags within my paper notebook as I find they inhibit the flow of scanning the items.  I do use them in my digital version but that is purely to enable an automatic summary of items.  If I do notate any items (by type for example) I do it by means of a suffix to the task itself, rather than by a tag, as that does not impact on scanning but does enable easy identification if needed.  For example, if I add an email related task to my list (which I will have filed in a folder named Autofocus in Outlook) I will suffix the task with AFe.<br><br>Waiting for tasks can be dealt with by means of a question mark, eg Fred called back? If the answer is "no" I can either action by calling Fred or by crossing off and readding the task at the end of the list.</div>
