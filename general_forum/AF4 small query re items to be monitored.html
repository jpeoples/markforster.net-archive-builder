<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br>One small query I have - if you deal with something to the full extent that you can, and now are waiting a response from someone-else that will determine your next action AND you believe you're going to have to wait sometime for that reply, do you add that item to your active list, and is it ok for it to keep moving from backlog to active (as you close off your current backlog)? Or do you have an alternative method for dealing with those sorts of items?<br><br>Thanks<br><br>Donna</div>

<div class="content">You could, if you want to be continually reminded.  Or you could put it in a separate tickler file or a note on your calendar.  Whatever feels right to you.</div>

<div class="content">Donna:<br><br>Mike is right. If you are expecting it to take more than a couple of days, put a reminder to follow-up in Outlook Tasks or similar. The reminder is to put the task back on your list.</div>

<div class="content">I usually put an item on the list. When it stands out, I send a reminder in some form (mail, phone, chat), and enter it again, usually reworded to remind me the action taken.<br><br>If it is not time for a reminder, I re-enter it. In doing so, I usually rephrase it to make it more clear what the next action will be from my side, e.g. chase, call, &c.</div>

<div class="content">For this I maintain a Waiting For list (one thing I've continued with from GTD days).  <br><br>I put any item that's waiting for a response from someone else on this list (including any deliveries I'm expecting).  I record the date I enter the item, the person/company name, a description, optionally a target delivery date (for the cases where someone has committed to a date) and finally a follow up date. <br><br> I have a recurring task on my AF list to 'Check Waiting For'.  When I hit this task a quick scan of my W/F list picks up any task that is due a follow up, once I've worked on it I put in a new follow up date.  When I've finished my W/F List scan I cross out the AF entry and re-enter it on the Active part of the list.<br><br>Personally I find it helpful to keep all these items together rather than spread through my AF list.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Simon,<br><br>This is exactly what I do as well -- I have a category in Outlook tasks entitled "Waiting for".  I too put a task in AF4 called "check Waiting for".  I find that this works well for me and I like these in one place rather than spread through the AF list.<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Exactly what I do as well ... except for the AF part.  I simply check that "tickler list" every morning when I scan the list for urgencies and look at the calendar and schedule.  Once all of that is done, I can start doing things ;-)  I only have to check the tickler file once a day ... I can't think why I'd need to do it more often.  Maybe others work to a finer anualrity of time than I do ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Ooops, I think I may have left the wrong impression.  In the AM after I have scanned the tickler list, IF I find something that needs to be done that day THEN I add it to the AF list (or priority list or whatever).  IOW, the point of a tickler file is to tickle me when it is time to take action.  In that sense AF is duplicating the feature and I don't need to be tickled twice ... or all I'd do all day long is laugh ;-)</div>
