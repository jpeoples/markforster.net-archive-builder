<div class="content">I came across a book recently called Mini Habits. I did a search and I think this book has been mentioned only once on these forums. The main thrust of the book seems to gel well with Mark's writings, namely little and often.<br><br><a href="http://www.amazon.ca/dp/B00HGKNBDK/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.ca/dp/B00HGKNBDK/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1</a><br><br>There seems to be a number of other authors that have trumpeted the idea of small habits, such as James Clear in Atomic Habits or Piotr Wozniak with his micro-rules of productivity.<br><br><a href="http://supermemo.guru/wiki/Micro-rules_of_productivity" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://supermemo.guru/wiki/Micro-rules_of_productivity</a></div>

<div class="content">There seems to be a new book every year on the value of small habits. While some might claim that this is just repeating the old stuff, I think that the fact that so many people are arriving at this solution indicates its worth and value. Along with James Clear and Wozniak that you mention, you can also include the "Power of Habit" author and Mauer's "Kaizen" books as other "micro habit" books.</div>

<div class="content">Stephen Guise wrote a follow-up book called Elastic Habits, where basically every day you score your chosen habits from 1-3, where 1 is the mini-habit level and 2/3 require more effort (you define and calibrate what is required to earn each level).<br><br>I liked the system enough to use it for more than two years now.</div>

<div class="content">Currently reading Elastic Habits and it is an engaging read.<br><br>I like that you can adjust your habits effort level based on your current situation to avoid "zero days"</div>
