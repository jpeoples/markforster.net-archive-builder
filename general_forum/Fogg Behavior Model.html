<div class="content">I know this has been shared before, and many of you probably have come across this, but I found it pretty insightful and wanted to share it again :) It's from Fogg's book Tiny Habits (and elsewhere). <br><br>The model is essentially:<br><br>B = MAP<br>Behaviour = Motivation x Ability x Prompt<br>                or Desire to do it x How easy/difficult it is for you to do x Reminder to do it<br><br>If you want to do something more often, you can:<br>- increase your desire to do it<br>- make it easier to do<br>- set up more reminders to do it<br><br>If you want to do something less, you can:<br>- reduce your desire to do it<br>- make it harder to do<br>- reduce/eliminate reminders to do it<br><br>It's almost like we can dial knobs in our lives to direct our actions... like we're a machine lol<br><br>I feel like maybe there's some insights in there if we look at Mark's work in this light. For example, for long lists:<br>- repeated exposure to a task "softening" it to us = increasing desire<br>- reformulating tasks, crossing it out for even just a little work on it = making it easier<br>- repeated scanning of list = many reminders<br><br>Super random aside, but this seems to meld well with Henry George's proposition in his book The Science of Political Economy that the fundamental law of political economy is that: People seek to fulfill (behaviour) their desires (motivation) with the least effort (ability). Maybe George could have specified "desires they're aware of (prompt)" to match Fogg's model :)<br><br>Any thoughts?</div>

<div class="content">Interesting summary. For me, the hardest part if getting really clear about the desired behavior.</div>
