<div class="content">Up early to start doing stuff before I leave on four week assignment in Africa tomorrow lunchtime, found that Mark was the earlier bird catching the worm, so read through his email on the new system.<br><br>I was tempted to use a notebook and the pen/highlighter method, but despite my advancing years, I am determined to arrive at a workable electronic solution.  Like David D and others, I use Linenberger's TWC Second Edition approach which, as others say, has much of DIT in it (which is why I tipped off Michael L about DIT last year).<br><br>So I've set up two pages in a new OneNote 2007 notebook:<br>AFTM Office/Work<br>AFTM Personal<br><br>Each has already got a list and I've put the date at the top per Mark's suggestion; I may create a separate sub-page for each day so that I can always go back to see what has been dismissed or overlooked.  If I didn't already have OneNote 2007, I'd be creating the list in Word or whatever.  But OneNote 2007 is quite integrated with Outlook 2007. which is my TWC tool, so it makes sense for me to go this route.<br><br>My intention is to do the immediate/urgent stuff on the list, but create an Outlook task/link so that it appears in Outlook as Priority High/Normal/Low per the TWC approach.  This may seem like double-counting, but I like AFTM as a collection point for everything, then use TWC so that I know the Low items have been recorded and will pop up in Outlook as configured by the system, but I can always use AFTM to see everything.<br><br>This is what I like about AFTM, especially as one place to collect all those thoughts about future issues, wants and desires, goals, visions etc, yet without any rigid classification so that the rational and sub-conscious minds can co-exist, I hope!<br><br>I'm not sure if my hybrid approach will work, time will tell, but if it works for me, that's the most important thing.  I'd be interested to share electronic approaches with others, even if they use EverNote or other applications.<br><br>Now to put a few more ticks and strikethroughs to the several I have already achieved today.  I'll revisit Marks email on the 10 hour flight to Johannesburg, bt must remember to check out this discussion forum before I leave - it's going on the list now!<br></div>
