<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>In your first book you reccomended working in timed bursts rotating around several groups of tasks. In DIT you seem to lean towards working in batches and clearing the whole lot before moving on. Which have you found to be more efficient? The opinions of the other members are welcomed also.</div>

<div class="content">Hi, Joe. Thanks for the query. I normally find that grouping in batches is more effective. But in fact there is nothing incompatible about them. The DIT Will Do list and Task List lend themselves very well to being done in timed bursts if you wish to do so.</div>
