<div class="content">Sometimes on a page, I don't get a task that stands out, but I don't feel I can dismiss the page, because it contains things that must get done. In this case I will sometimes choose the task that doesn't not stand out the least, if that makes sense--maybe it's just the least onerous of several onerous tasks.<br><br>Anyone have similar situation, with maybe a better solution?</div>

<div class="content">Always remember that you can spent as little time on a task as you wish. As long as you do something, you get to cross it off.</div>

<div class="content">ds, <br><br>I remember Mark having written pretty much the same you describe: If you don't get the feeling of a task 'standing out', do rate the resistance on a scale (1-10?), and do the task with the lowest score. <br><br>I hope I remember that right. <br><br>And, of course, Andreas is right in what he says.</div>

<div class="content">ds<br><br>I find that too but am continually amazed how even those tasks that I would initially have run screaming in the opposite direction from actually have very little resistance left by that time.  I can certainly put up with the odd task where it's a case of just getting it out of the way.  Mind you I am finding that even those are relatively few and far between the more I use the system.  I think that has to do with learning how to phrase the tasks in a different way from the outset.</div>

<div class="content">Christine,<br><br>If you don't mind, could you say some more about "learning how to phrase the tasks in a different way" please?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Steve<br><br>Rephrasing can enable us to get past some of the internal resistances to tasks by simply changing the way in which we look at them.  For example, I lose a file - if I write a task on my list "find file" then a number of thought processes come into play "If I can't find it then I've failed at the task", "It could take ages to find" "if I don't find it then xyz will happen ..." Just that one simple 2 word task throws up (1) fear of failure (2) concern over the size/time requirement of the task (3) reminder of the consequences - just plain fear!!   On the other hand rephrasing it as "look for file" eliminates those fears in one sweep - the task is now (1) achievable (2) no size or time requirement is attached and (3) the whole fact that the task is now easy to action eliminates the fear and enables the mind to work in the background suggesting where it may be.<br><br>The other area where rephrasing has impact is in the area of projects.  For example sometimes I will just list a task that encompasses a whole range of things, "Family Tree" "Email" and actioning it can encompass a variety of things.  Sometimes I will rephrase that task to be more speciific - "Order Certificate for xyz" - "File Sent Items on Laptop" <br><br>When I started AF I would have tasks like "clear backlog x" which as you can imagine came neatly packaged with their own little clouds of doom and gloom.  As simple a change as just "backlog x" enables me to easily do a little on the task and before I know it "backlog x" is cleared.  <br><br>You may also find the following thread to be of help<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/623288" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/623288</a><br><br>Hope that helps .......</div>
