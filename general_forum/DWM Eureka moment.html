<div class="content">Yesterday, Omnifocus on my iPhone indicated that 5 tasks - all red - were going to be overdue in 48 hours. The combination of color (red) and numerical indicator (5) created anxiety (a good thing). With AF 1-4, I never felt the pull to work on potential dismissed items. Even though I'm in the middle of preparing an important workshop (Learning to love: How relationships help you grow), I believe I'll find time to apply some "little and often" to those tasks. Very cool.</div>

<div class="content">My first outstanding tasks are not until Feb 11th, and I've already gone past Feb 6th and 7th without having to dismiss any tasks.</div>
