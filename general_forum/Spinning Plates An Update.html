<div class="content">I've been using Spinning Plates at work and at home for a week. So far, it seems to be doing a really good job of allowing me to make progress on my multiple projects. Here are the issues I ran into and the modifications I made:<br><br>PROBLEM: Too much resistance to working on the entire system at all.<br>SOLUTION: Select the task to do next using "random", a task with a checkmark next to it can't be selected until the next round.<br>ANALYSIS: This did a good job of encouraging me to use the system in total. I eventually found it slightly too much overhead to use a random number generator and switched to just treating the spinning plates as a closed list. It's almost as effective at eliminating resistance (for me) and requires less overhead.<br><br>PROBLEM: Anxiety about tasks that aren't yet on the list.<br>SOLUTION: Create a "new" list of upcoming projects/tasks I want to add to the list when I have time.<br>ANALYSIS: This is more of a comfort thing to keep my head clear of tasks more than anything else. Sometimes it's more effective to just go off of my memory, but having the list does help me say "no" to things.<br><br>PROBLEM: My task list gets full of things that are "done for today" and don't make sense to work on until tomorrow<br>SOLUTION: Have a special state of "done for now" which means I don't inspect them for additional work, but add them back to the list after I sleep.<br>ANALYSIS: This seems to allow me to focus to a greater extent. I may end up moving those daily tasks to some sort of checklist, but a lot of them do better in bursts throughout the day. E.g. if I write on my novella in three 15 minute bursts during the morning, I don't have to worry about it the rest of the day.<br><br>I also moved to an electronic implementation using Trello and color coding. So far it feels like I'm being super productive with it and focusing narrowly on the few projects that I really want to do. It also makes me feel confident that if my priorities change I can drop things off my plate as appropriate.<br><br>REMAINING ISSUES: There's a big project at work that I have been resisting adding to the system because I know it'll pressure me to make progress on it! I'd much rather add more fun fiddly things (e.g. learn how to use a new tool, etc.) On one hand this is frustrating, but on the other hand the problem of resistance has become glaringly obvious using Spinning Plates.</div>
