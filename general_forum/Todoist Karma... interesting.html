<div class="content">I've been hearing good things about Todoist, but Karma - https://en.todoist.com/karma - adds an element of fun and accountability I haven't seen in other list/project management apps. <br><br>Can anyone share their experiences with this app?</div>

<div class="content">Also, the gamification aspect of Karma would play nicely with DWM (one of my favourite Forster systems).</div>

<div class="content">Avrum, I love Todoist, but the Karma thing doesn't do much for me. I keep using it and my Karma line keeps going up. I find the productivity bar graphs and pie charts much more motivating.</div>

<div class="content">I use Todoist but more because I find the software itself very clean and easy to use. The Karma is interesting to view but since it doesn't measure the time you spend on a task it doesn't really mean much. Paying a bill would get you the same points as writing a report which took 2 hours. What would be really handy would be if you could assign a number to signify importance of a task and the chart was based on that. <br><br>Great programme anyway though, you can make it as simple or complicated as you want, but it's fast and fuss free to use.</div>
