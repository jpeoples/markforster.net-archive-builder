<div class="content">I know this topic has been discussed extensively but found the following article interesting<br><br>3D Juggling 431: The Sock Drawer<br>which can be found at<br><a href="http://www.3dcoaching.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.3dcoaching.blogspot.com/</a><br><br>particularly the point that whilst some people are driven by goals others are demotivated by them.  There is a link to an interesting article on research in this area entitled "Are you a Goal Junkie?" <br><br><a href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6778/is_2008_May/ai_n28521584/" rel="nofollow">http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6778/is_2008_May/ai_n28521584/</a></div>

<div class="content">Christine,<br><br>I did not read much of the "goal junkie" article because within a very few sentences this guy convinced me he can't THINK.  He, right out of the gate, criticizes all goals because the "method" someone, in one case, chose to implement one goal had a bad result.  This is somewhat like criticizing transportation because some cars crash.<br><br>In some previous exchanges there was talk about how you define these terms.  I think this well illustrates why it is important to know what one is talking about.<br><br>I'm getting the impression that being "anti-goal" has become something of a fad!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike<br><br>I do think you need to at least read to the end of the article before criticising but I have never got the impression that there is a fad of "anti goaliness".  For me personally I find it refreshing to read that not everyone thinks the same about goals.  In the same way that the MBTI enabled me to see that my way of doing things was consistent with my personality type rather than being abnormal, it is helpful for me to see that others have discovered that goals can evolve more naturally and still be valid and create the desired results without having to have been SMART or any other designated structure at the outset.<br><br>Mike, you do seem to be a little sensitive on the goals issue.  For me the way people plan or goal set IS influenced by other factors such as personality typing etc - I do not see that one method is necessarily better than another in it's own right, but I do think that certain methods of goals planning will be "better" for some people than others.<br><br>In the same way that I aspire to complete orderliness, my means of reaching that "goal" as it were will be very different to the means in which you would reach that same goal.  We would no doubt both have a plan but those plans would look very different and we would probably refer to them differently.  Do you not agree?</div>

<div class="content">Bobb Biehl wrote a book a while back that some people are motiviated to solve problems and some are motiviated to reach a goal. <a href="http://www.aylen.com/cartweaver2cf_Aylen/Details.cfm?ProdID=15&category=3" rel="nofollow">http://www.aylen.com/cartweaver2cf_Aylen/Details.cfm?ProdID=15&category=3</a><br><br>Someone who's motivated to solve a problem (what's the best route between Point A and Point B that avoids Point C?) may not be as motivated to reach a goal (get to Point B by Tuesday) The end result is the same - getting to point B - but the motivation is different.<br><br>He equated it to the difference (in sports) between someone playing a defensive position vs offensive position. Players who are good at defense may not be good in offense or vice versa. .</div>

<div class="content">How people can perceive things so radically different. I find the goals discussion really interesting throughout all the threads. To echo something that has been echoed a good many times, pick the 'middle way'. The extremes (goalless vs goalaholic) usually aren't effective unless the context attunes to it. I think the article preaches the middle way.<br><br>At the very end the author states:<br><br>"The paradox, of course, is that to achieve such a drastic change in perception, attitude and behaviour, they need initially to set a vision of what such a change may look like. The challenge lies in whether this simply becomes another highly focused goal, or a sense of purpose, through which they seize opportunities to adopt new behaviours on their journey."<br><br>Where he mentions vision I think is one of the key points. Goals set without a clear vision/desired outcome are more vulnerable to being counter productive, whether they are set the SMART way or not.  If you take the time to visualize the goal, you're more likely to identify the 'pulse'of the goal, i.e. are you setting this because you want it, or is it to please someone else (recipe for resistance). <br><br>I'll agree with Mike in that just because a SMART goal fails, it isn't because of something inherently wrong with setting goals/smart goals. Goals are tools, it's how you use them. When they are used incorrectly then obviously they don't work, but it's not the tools fault. I think the author made a few good points on how to use goals effectively.</div>

<div class="content">Of course the classic treatment on goals and why they sometimes de-motivate and sometimes inspire is "How to Make Your Dreams Come True". Modesty forbids me to name the author, but I note that there are now some used copies on Amazon priced at less than three figures!<br><br>The author deals with three modes of living. First, Push mode in which you push yourself towards your goals. Secondly, Drift mode in which you get fed up with pushing yourself and allow yourself to drift aimlessly. And thirdly, Pull mode in which you have set your goals in such a way that they pull you towards them. Most people of course don't live exclusively in one mode all the time.<br><br>The book is basically about how you can avoid the first two modes and live in Pull mode to the fullest extent possible.</div>

<div class="content">On the 3D Coaching article, they said the following (emphasis mine):<br><br>"In fact, our DECISION to expand into new premises was the result of a conversation at our team awayday."<br><br>Hello?  You made a decision to expand into new premises.  That's a goal.  At least in my dictionary, the definition of goal is  "The purpose toward which an endeavor is directed; an objective."  <br><br>If you aren't motivated by your goals, they really aren't right *for you*.  Or the methods you're using to get there aren't right *for you*.  I've had plenty of carrot type goals, but have put myself through many of the stick type of goals as well.  That's why I enjoyed the goal junkie article, especially as I agree with him that adapting goals to changing circumstances is critical.  I like adapting stick goals to carrot goals.  :-)  <br><br>A couch potato could have a New Year's resolution / goal of getting into really awesome shape in time for swimsuit season.  They even plan the goal out in a SMART kind of way.   So they sign up for a gym, schedule exercise time in their daytimers, buy a treadmill, go on a diet that's quite different from the way they usually eat, etc. etc.  Probably only .01% or less of these types of goal-setters actually stick with their goal and get into great shape.  After the initial honeymoon period, they're back to where they were, feeling like their goal was demotivating.  I have seen a lot of people however, who followed a very structured 12 week program like Body for Life (I did this, I believe Mel did too) and got into the best shape of their lives.  I think the difference is the clarity of the vision.  <br><br>When it comes to methods though, if you aren't a person with a lot of self-discipline in a certain area, you need to set things up so you succeed in spite of yourself.  Two years ago, I wanted to leave work at a reasonable hour and get more exercise - every day, not just when the weather was nice.  I bought a golden retriever and could count on one hand the number of days I have missed either walking, jogging or biking ever since.  <br><br>Clutterbuck referenced Herminia Ibarra (thanks! - I've been racking my brain trying to recall her name).  I read her book on careers - and it was extremely valuable to me.  It's called "Working Identity: Unconventional Strategies for Reinventing Your Career."  It doesn't just focus on careers, it's a different way of thinking - more of an AF way.  <br><br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Working-Identity-Unconventional-Strategies-Reinventing/dp/1591394139/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1243868820&sr=8-1#" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Working-Identity-Unconventional-Strategies-Reinventing/dp/1591394139/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1243868820&sr=8-1#</a><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Lillian<br><br>Interesting comment "that some people are motiviated to solve problems and some are motiviated to reach a goal."<br><br>As a confirmed "problem solver" type I wonder if I would be more motivated by goals if I looked at them as "How can I solve the problem of xxxx?"</div>

<div class="content">Mark, that is one of your best articles (although they're all really good).  <br><br>I have a couple of pages of notes on Pull vs. Push from your book "How to Make Your Dreams Come True" at the back of my AF book.  I just have one question - wouldn't being in "Pull Mode" sort of conflict with following the AF rules at times ?   I don't have the book here, but in my notes I have written: "... times it's easiest to live in Pull Mode - get a strong impulse to do something and the energy to do it comes bubbling up.  Stop worrying about what I *ought* to be doing.  Let go and have faith in the process."  <br><br>Doesn't that kind of go along with following impulses and not sticking to the structure of AF?<br><br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Goals and planning has worked well for me in situations when time is tight (eg during university or planning a wedding) and it really is necessary to sit down and co-ordinate a number of activities to make sure they get done on time. In general though it hasn't really worked very well, and I think that's because (a) deep down I know that day-to-day plans aren't urgent, (b) long-term plans are always shifting about, (c) goals are too boring and tedious to review regularly, (d) the goals that most inspire me are feelings, mental pictures, vague ideas etc, and most importantly (e) I don't know the steps to get from point A to point B. <br><br>     With regard to item (e), any advice on achieving plans/goals where you don't know how to achieve the outcome? A lot of advocates of goal-setting/planning will say that it's just a matter of putting an entry on your to-do list of "learn more about XYZ" or "pick up a book on XYZ", but I've always found that to be a stumbling block -- if you want to operate a hotel in the Rocky Mountains but don't have any experience and have never lived in the area, then "learn more about operating a hotel" or "pick up a book about the Rocky Mountains" doesn't really cut it. <br><br>     Personally I've found that it has worked better to have 10 or 15 goals along the lines of "operate a hotel in the Rocky Mountains", and then it's a matter of being open to opportunity. That goal would be achieved not by making a specific plan, but rather by at least being aware of the goal and then one day you pick up the newspaper and see a Rocky Mountain hotel for sale. <br><br>     Still, I'd like to hear what people have to say about getting from point A to point B and sticking with the plan. How do you fill in the unknowns and adapt to new information? I read somewhere that you should rewrite your goals every night -- that way you not only stick with them but you continually adapt them as you learn more about what will be involved. Haven't tried that out though.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine,<br><br>>>> I do think you need to at least read to the end of the article before criticising >>><br><br>Read to the end of that article?  And lose more minutes from my life?  LOL ;-)  I guess at this point I'd have to have someone convince me that even the level of effort necessary to READ a few pages is worth while.<br><br>It is not as if he said something really interesting ... he said something really dumb.  And not just that it does not agree with my views ;-)  But that it is irrational.  "This guy planned something and it went wrong so setting goals is bad."  Now I SUPPOSE that he could completely reverse himself on the next page ... but what would THAT tell me about his clarity of thought?<br><br>In general, I agree with you about reading the whole thing.  But this guy is so far beyond silly that I won't incur even that small cost.<br><br>>>> but I have never got the impression that there is a fad of "anti goaliness". For me personally I find it refreshing to read that not everyone thinks the same about goals. >>><br><br>I guess my point was that he does not bring anything fresh and new to the table ... there are lots of people who are anti-goal and anti-planning so I was musing that we seem to be going through some kind of cultural phase.  It might be linked to the whole new age woo-woo thing we have been in for some time.  Or it may be a throw back to the '60's and '70's where everyone was high, naked, and not thinking past the next party.  I dunno.  It certainly feels like we are in some kind of sea change.<br><br>>>> In the same way that the MBTI enabled me to see that my way of doing things was consistent with my personality type rather than being abnormal, it is helpful for me to see that others have discovered that goals can evolve more naturally and still be valid and create the desired results without having to have been SMART or any other designated structure at the outset. <<<<br><br>It could be that one of us has missed the point he was making.  I'll assume it was me because I did not stick with him for the whole ride down the rabbit hole.  ;-)  Where the wheels left the cart for me was in his equating a "goal" with the "plan".  SMART pertains to a goal ... it has nothing to say about the plan.<br><br>>>> Mike, you do seem to be a little sensitive on the goals issue. <<<<br><br>Not so much as you have gleaned, I guess.  I'm more perplexed and astonished and, dare I say it, flabbergasted that anyone would take the position that knowing where one is going is a bad thing.  I mean, other than a surprise party ;-)<br><br>>>> For me the way people plan or goal set IS influenced by other factors such as personality typing etc - I do not see that one method is necessarily better than another in it's own right, but I do think that certain methods of goals planning will be "better" for some people than others. <<<<br><br>I agree with that in general.  BUT ... no matter how you get to a goal one must have a goal in order to get anywhere in particular (rather than just somewhere randomly).  I acknowledge that some people prefer to just drift and be surprised at where they end up.  But that is not a "planning methodology" so much as it is no plan or direction at all.  Lots of people live that way.  That is largely why some things don't work that well in our world today ... but that is another story ;-)<br><br>>>> In the same way that I aspire to complete orderliness, my means of reaching that "goal" as it were will be very different to the means in which you would reach that same goal. We would no doubt both have a plan but those plans would look very different and we would probably refer to them differently. Do you not agree? <<<<br><br>I completely agree there ... but notice that by the time you got to this point in your post you began to distinguish between "goal" and "plan".  That is exactly what the writer of the article failed to do (at the point where I bailed on him.)  Just for the sake of clarity:<br><br>1st - Decide if you have any destination at all<br>2nd - Define it as a goal and make it well-formed (SMART, if you like)<br>3rd - Put a plan in place<br>4th - Take action according to the plan<br>5th - Note feedback (Success?  Failure?  Frustration?)<br>6th - Modify the plan as suggested by the feedback.<br>7th - Go back to step 4 until the train pulls into your station ;-)<br><br>If you have no intention to do anything in particular, skip all of the above steps.  If you have anywhere you'd like to be other than right here, hit ever step according to your best understanding and ability of how to plan and execute actions.<br><br>Just as I'm not dictating WHERE everyone should want to wind up, I'm not dictating what planning process works best for everyone nor what method of following that plan is best.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Peter,<br><br>>>>  How people can perceive things so radically different. I find the goals discussion really interesting throughout all the threads. <<<<br><br>Yeah, it is fascinating ... and I seem to have stepped in it again.  Perhaps I should put a statement about the importance of goals in a Sig and save the typing?  ;-)<br><br>>> To echo something that has been echoed a good many times, pick the 'middle way'. The extremes (goalless vs goalaholic) usually aren't effective unless the context attunes to it.

As soon as someone mentions "vision", I fasten my seat belt.  It usually means that the road ahead is full of pot holes.<br><br>We used to talk about "goals", "plans", and "schedules".  It was muddy enough with just those ideas.  (Ex. When does a due date become part of the goal or part of the schedule?)  Then one dismal rainy afternoon, when some out of work writer it the bottom of his bottle, he started writing about "visions".  When he ran out of gas on that one he came up with "missions".  Clarity of thought is not enhanced by proliferation of terminology.<br><br>If one tries to deconstruct that paragraph you cited it comes down to a mess of contradictory ideas.  Why can one not "seize opportunities" while executing a plan leading to a goal unless one first defines a "vision"?  Bull.  Since when do we have to layer on levels of junk in order to just say ... plan ahead?<br><br>>>> Where he mentions vision I think is one of the key points. Goals set without a clear vision/desired outcome are more vulnerable to being counter productive, whether they are set the SMART way or not. <<<<br><br>I don't believe one can follow the SMART steps and not envision the outcome.<br><br>Specific - as compared to what?  What level of specificity?  That takes thinking about vagueness vs. a specific outcome.<br><br>Measurable - what is the measure?  What units?  How much?  How little?  All of that takes looking at alternatives.<br><br>Achievable - This takes considering ones resources, abilities, time frame, etc.  All of that involves considering alternatives.<br><br>Etc.  I don't get layering on "Once you have done all of that work, sit down and envision where you will end up."  If you have not done that, you can not have done the other things.  His first (and worst, I suppose) example involved someone who did not foresee an outcome he COULD NOT IMAGINE.  Not that he did not try ... there is no evidence of that.  These were sales and marketing people who he criticized for not being geopolitical economists.<br><br>>>> If you take the time to visualize the goal, you're more likely to identify the 'pulse'of the goal, i.e. are you setting this because you want it, or is it to please someone else (recipe for resistance). >>><br><br>I have no problem with doing that.  It is a good idea.  I'm wondering how he thinks that one can produce a well-formed goal WITHOUT doing that.  IOW, I don't see it so much as a seperate step as inherently bound up in every step.<br><br>I acknowledge that there are people who form goals like: "Dude, I'm gonna be a millionare by the time I'm 30."  Then they take a hit of weed.  That is NOT a well-formed goal and one should not criticize goals because ill-formed goals are apt to fail.<br><br>>>> I'll agree with Mike in that just because a SMART goal fails, it isn't because of something inherently wrong with setting goals/smart goals. Goals are tools, it's how you use them.

<div class="content">Jacqueline,<br><br>Yes, you nailed it.  The problem with the "new year's resolution diet/exercisers" is that the goal is not REALLY well-formed.  And the meta-plan (if I can call it that) has the feedback step missing.  IOW, they don't look at the outcome of the small actions and alter what they are doing based on that.  They go to the gym, hurt themselves and don't lose weight ... and give up.  They don't think: "Should I try a different machine?  Fewer reps?  Lighter weights?  Workout every OTHER day?  Change my diet AS WELL?"<br><br>And your example of the dog well illustrates the point that one has to "plan for failure" (not plan TO fail ;-).  "What can go wrong?  What has gone wrong in the past?  I've not walked EVERY day for a long period to get my body to a new set point.  How can I ASSURE that I'll do it this time?  Oh, I know, I'll set it up so someone depends on me to exercise.  I'll get a dog.  What heartless soul would get a dog and not walk it every day?  What kind of dog?  Oh, a BIG DOG, one that NEEDS LOTS of exercise."  ;-)<br><br>When I work with people who want to stop smoking, I will spend an inordinate amount of time setting the circumstances such that if they fail, it has to be because they WANT TO FAIL.  For example:<br><br>- Detail the car (to get rid of the smell of smoke)<br>- Wash the drapes.  The whole house in fact.  (As above.)<br>- Advertise your plan. (To put your ego at risk if you fail.)<br>- Make a terrible bet if you smoke again.<br>- Take up an aerobic sport so you need wind<br>- Etc.<br><br>I'm all for well-formed goals with lots of planning for what can go wrong and setting the right conditions for success.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Simon,<br><br>>>> With regard to item (e), any advice on achieving plans/goals where you don't know how to achieve the outcome? A lot of advocates of goal-setting/planning will say that it's just a matter of putting an entry on your to-do list of "learn more about XYZ" or "pick up a book on XYZ", but I've always found that to be a stumbling block -- if you want to operate a hotel in the Rocky Mountains but don't have any experience and have never lived in the area, then "learn more about operating a hotel" or "pick up a book about the Rocky Mountains" doesn't really cut it. <<<<br><br>I have found that it does cut it.  It is not JUST a matter of putting "learn more" on your list.  It is a matter of making THAT a sub goal.  HOW does one learn more?  Read a book?  Yeah, for a start.  Or research on the web, maybe.<br><br>But is that enough.  Not at all.  Why not go on trips to the Rocky Mountains and stay at hotels or bed and breakfasts frequently and talk to the owners.  Some people have joined an organization (I found this out on my last trip) which supports people who want to get into that field.  It places them with owners who want to take vacations and they get to run a place for a few days to a week or a month at a time and really get into it.  Most of them decide that it is not for them, once they realize the amount of work involved.  But that is a valid outcome.<br><br>There are other "half-steps" you might take.  Maybe move there in your current job area and explore the area over a longer period of time.  Become part of the community.  It all comes down to your level of commitment and your creativity.<br><br>For example, I own some property 3,000 miles from where I live.  I was uncomfortable with the property manager and in my talking with people on-line found a person willing to drive 50 miles and give me an eyes-on report.  Just a wonderfully nice stranger.  People are like that.  They will often do very nice things for you just because of who they are.  I'd suggest that you commit to changing your life and move toward it at a pace that makes sense for you and keep reviewing your goal, taking feed back, and changing your plan.<br><br>>>> Personally I've found that it has worked better to have 10 or 15 goals along the lines of "operate a hotel in the Rocky Mountains", and then it's a matter of being open to opportunity. That goal would be achieved not by making a specific plan, but rather by at least being aware of the goal and then one day you pick up the newspaper and see a Rocky Mountain hotel for sale. >>><br><br>Then what? Buy it and hope to hell you knew how to evaluate it, pay the right price, and operate it?  And where would you get a loan with no operations experience under your belt?  I'm all for serendipity, but that usually comes as a result of hard work on a focused goal.  Just FWIW and IMHO and YMMV and all of that stuff ;-)<br></div>

<div class="content">Christine, you said:<br><br>"doesn't that typify a goal that has been "grown organically" to quote MF rather than a predetermined, fully defined, goal."<br><br>What does that really mean?   I don't think this goal as described was really that "organic" just because it arose from a conversation.   My goals arise from conversations I have with myself (or a wiser version of myself - the one that doesn't know what it means to be afraid - or fail) all the time.  <br><br>I don't think this kind of goal is any better than my type of goal of moving towards a vision of an ideal life.  I don't think I'll ever really get there (or I'd be content if I did get there), but that doesn't matter - I'll be further ahead than if I never tried.  Sometimes that means making a complete departure from the path that I'm on, but I've just put a bit of thought into it to try to define what makes me happy rather than following a bunch of whims (not that I've never done that).  Fully defined doesn't mean competely rigid and not subject to change.  It's an iterative process.<br><br><br>BTW Simon, I live in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains - here's one property listed:<br><a href="http://www.albertafirst.com/realestate/Default.aspx?commercialforsale=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.albertafirst.com/realestate/Default.aspx?commercialforsale=1</a><br><br>Real estate prices have dropped in AB and BC quite a lot lately.

<div class="content">RE Mike on visualization :<br>Mike said "Clarity of thought is not enhanced by proliferation of terminology."<br><br>Why Mike you do have a penchant for creatively counterarguing points for the simple point of counterarguing, even if you haven't read the article. It's interesting that in one thread you're heralding the novel concept of multisensory learning and playing down the idea of using forms of visualization in a next. Ah yes, but the difference is you're arguing different points in different threads for the sake of..ah yes for what?:)<br><br>To respond to the visualization thing though to which you refer to as 'new age babble'. I think the points raised in the article are that smart goals often fall short. I know in my experience they have, no matter how precise I've set them. I highlight the vision-element to goalsetting because if you're undertaking a major goal/objective you can gain much more leverage much than just setting a smart goal if you spend some time thinking about what the outcome would look and feel like. <br><br>Case in point, let's suppose your weed-loving wanne-be millionaire had set a smart goal. '1 million dollars in my swedish bankaccount before my 30st birthday'. Even if that wanne-be goes in to wallstreet and makes a tidy fortune by his birthday and he's met his smart goal, he still might not really have achieved the outcome that he really wanted. He might be up to his ears in responsibilities, have no time for family and hate the job he does, but he still has met his smart goal.<br><br>It's an exaggerated but common enough example. However, if you're going to do something that requires planning and goals to be set, why not spend a few minutes visualizing what the outcome would actually feel like - especially if you're going to spend a large volume of work to accomplish it. Your wanne-be milliionnaire would more likely pick up on the desire to have a certain lifestyle, not have to work 80 hour week and do a job he loves while achieving his goal to a million dollars. See the point is people skip from a smart goal to an outcome that seems logical at the time, but really doesn't plot the trajectory as nicely as you think. Visualizing greatly enhances the detail of the intended destination in expanded ways.<br><br>Policy makers make those mistakes all the time. They look at the numbers and have objectives that need to fit these quantifiable outcomes. My uncle mentioned a hospital policy of having to take care of x amount of patients in IC by x amount of time. Sure the hospital met the rule, but they cheated so they could meet the requirement by keeping people longer in the ambulance since the time didn't start running until the patient actually was inside IC. <br><br>If however the policy makers would ask a doctor 'what does a better run hospital look like' and then use our goal-oriented minds to achieve that, you might have a different story. <br><br>Really, the brain is continually drawing and using visual information continually, whether you are conscious or not. For something as simple as 'looking for your keys' the brain involves a whole array of brain functions and it does so with little conscious effort. Little conscious effort is needed to visualize an intended outcome and have the mind go to work on it. Something AF also excels at : leveraging the subconscious processes to great effect. <br><br>Mike said "Clarity of thought is not enhanced by proliferation of terminology."<br>Isn't the enneagram a hodge podge of opinions of different authors who don't agree but use loads of terminology. If you add in all the wing-types you get hundreds of different combinations that are all interpreted differently by different 'experts'. If that isn't that diluted proliferation of terminology I don't know what is.

<div class="content">Mike, the problem though is that "learn more" is basically the entire plan at the beginning. And if operating a hotel in the Rockies is one of say 15 or 20 "someday/maybe"-type items, then it's not really practical to take the steps that you've listed. I wouldn't move across the country just to explore a someday/maybe item. <br><br>     This is where I always get stuck -- anything worth planning for always involves a huge amount of unknowns and often seems to break down at the "learn more" stage. If I already know all the steps, then why make a plan, unless I need to co-ordinate them all in a very short period of time? The appeal of the bottom-up approach is that you can keep 20 irons in the fire and then move forward on each iron as opportunity/more information arises.<br><br>     I was thinking though that one way of dealing with unknowns is to revise/rewrite the plan very regularly. How do other people deal with situations where 80% of the plan is unknown at the time of planning?<br><br>     Jacqueline, I'm not really thinking of moving to the Rockies -- I was just tossing that out as a random example. Beautiful area though -- I live in Toronto but I lived in Vancouver for 10 years and I really do miss the west.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike<br><br>I do wonder if we're even talking about the same article - he quotes an example to illustrate the fact that just because a goal is SMART doesn't mean it will be achieved.  He then goes on to clarify why and look at different options - and how is that so dumb?  And as for length of article ..... I suspect you and I have both written longer posts!! :-)<br><br><<BUT ... no matter how you get to a goal one must have a goal in order to get anywhere in particular (rather than just somewhere randomly). I acknowledge that some people prefer to just drift and be surprised at where they end up. But that is not a "planning methodology" so much as it is no plan or direction at all. Lots of people live that way. That is largely why some things don't work that well in our world today ... but that is another story ;-) >><br><br>I fully agree that planning is essential but not all the time.  Now, I just know I am going to be shot down for this but hey, whatever .....<br><br>I used to watch travel programs and think I would love to live on a marina.  It was not something I made into a goal or ever seriously thought of doing.  It was a dream, a wish, a someday/maybe item, just a thought.  Whenever I saw a marina I thought about it but rarely otherwise.  Then I decided it would be nice to have a weekend cottage - a place to get away.  Just a thought - no goal, no intensive planning.  I thought about it.  I thought some more.  I looked in Estate Agents windows.  I daydreamed.  Then someone mentioned they had done just that, and bought a cottage near to a marina, only about 50 miles away.  Marina - what marina? I hadn't even known it existed (well it was pretty new at the time).  So, I took myself off to the area, thinking it would be nice to live "near" a marina, registered interest with a couple of agents, and 18 months later had an apartment with amazing views straight down the marina.  Sure there were areas of planning but for me this was closer to what you describe above as "just drifting and being surprised where I ended up".   Maybe it is not "planning methodology" but just taking advantage of what came along ..... all I know is that I have the perfect place to live without all the hassle of being too SMART about it :-)</div>

<div class="content">Mark Forster:<br><br>I haven't read the book yet, just the reviews (some interesting comments on amazon!), but I snatched it for a couple of pounds. The push, drift and pull modes do raise a question for me:<br><br>If I'm visualizing push mode, I'm supposing the problem with that is the associated friction it creates, if I were to push a person (i.e. motivate him/her), what stops it from easily happening if I were to physically do this, is the friction of the floor surface interacting with the pressure I apply. If this person gets pulled however, there still is friction, it's just a different way of moving a person. <br><br>I think AF and other strategies are applied greatly because they help hurdle, avoid or work through friction with the least amount of effort.. What I'm keen to create is a downhill path with as little friction as possible. Or in other words a comfortable enjoyable journey. (although I realize the unintended bumps in the roads often contribute the most to a satisfying life)<br><br>So is the book about inspiring action/ using intrinsic motivation to achieve goals, or is the metaphor more about the opposite of pushing yourself toward goals, by having the goals pull you towards them? I think what I really mean to say is, is push and pull mode similar to the difference between using intrinsic and extrinsic motivation? I guess in that context the line between drift and pull mode can be very vague at times. <br></div>

<div class="content">Mark, that's a very good strategy, and in fact just by mentioning the idea in the forum Mike came up with a few ideas I wouldn't have thought of. <br><br>     Peter raises another key issue for me. A lot of things I would really like to do are mental "pictures" at this point. I visually know where I would like to live 10 years from now -- I can picture my desk and the view from my window quite clearly. But to turn that into a written "goal" or plan -- not that easy. At best it's an approximation -- sort of like describing a photograph in words falls short of the actual image. Always, it's the mental image that I want, rather than achieving the written approximation.<br><br>     It's amazing though how many of those mental images eventually become reality. I was driving down Highway 1 from San Francisco a few months ago through Big Sur, and there was a moment when I realized that one of those mental images from 10 years earlier had come to life.</div>

<div class="content">Simon, I think you do have to become comfortable with unknowns at some point.  <br><br>At the end of this year, I just have a few fairly vague goals where I'm not sure how I'm going to achieve them or how.  Today I had one of the finance directors where I work ask if I would come work in their group after I'm done my stint here.  If I wasn't very clear about what I *don't* want at least, I would probably take this opportunity which has been placed in my lap.   But it's not what I want, or even a step towards what I do want.  But I didn't tell her no directly anyway - doesn't hurt to keep your options open.  :-)<br><br>Re. moving forward from a vision.  Mark has a section in "How to Make Your Dreams Come True" on the ideal life he wishes to have.  I first did something similar to this a long time ago when reading Barbara Sher's book "Wishcraft".  She has a concept in the book called "Your Ideal Day" - when you write the narrative, you discover what she calls your "touchstone" - kind of similar to your purpose / highest value.  <br><br>When you identify what your goal is using her system, you use a backward planning method where you figure out what you would have to do before the goal is met to achieve it, and keep working backwards until you arrive at a flowchart where you have a step that is actionable right now.   Then you just have to work through the flowchart (modifying it as things change).  <br><br>I can't recommend this book highly enough.  It's a classic and been around for 30 years still in print for a reason.  Here's a better description of what I'm talking about.<br><a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/379196/how_to_plan_for_ones_goals_in_life.html?cat=7" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/379196/how_to_plan_for_ones_goals_in_life.html?cat=7</a><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Very interesting Jacqueline! I've done an exercise where you describe your ideal life. Loads of incredible success stories from doing that exercise. <br><br> I think once again that's the benefit of the visualisation element. You don't need to know the step by step and you can even go beyond what you currently think is possible. I've got numerous stories on how simple visualisation has worked for me. The flowchart you mention element is interesting. Sounds about the same as back-from-the-future thinking technique (might be an nlp thing). Although as others have noted, there are so many uncertains in life, you can't specifically incorporate them in a plan. I think the key is that you feel confident in achieving something and that belief carries over into taking the appropriate actions with the appropriate attitude. <br><br>Funny while browsing to Mark's book how to make your dreams come true, the 2nd book that comes up is Cosmic Ordering. That book describes a list method to creating a desired life. I sheepishly admit to having had some remarkable success with that method as well! Even worser still is that I found out about the book while reading 'woman's own' (there are some remarkable stories in their too). Don't ask me why I read that magazine, and no I don't have a subscription to that - I was just killing time:)</div>

I think I explained how you can't have a SMART (i.e. well-formed) goal without doing enough work to show you the future.  It is not sensible to think you have a well-formed goal but that it won't work unless you do something extra ... something that accomplishes what you need in order to have the goal in the first place.

He might be up to his ears in responsibilities, have no time for family and hate the job he does, but he still has met his smart goal. <<<<br><br>Oh, where to start ;-)  Firstly, that is a pretty poor goal statement.  It meets some of the technical points for a well-formed goal, but it is FAR from specific enough.  Well, maybe that is not stating the problem well enough.  One Million dollars is specific and measurable but there is no plan behind it.  How does one get One Million dollars?  Dose it fall from the sky?  What does he have to DO?  What steps does he take and how does it assure that he is on course.<br><br>But that aside, I think your point is that his goal, once achived, turns out to be not what he would have wanted had he known where it would lead.  Granted.  However, what makes you think he could have known where it would lead from where he was standing when he made the goal?  I have found that people can't make well-formed goals that are "too far" ahead of where they are now.  The weed smoking kid has not a clue what One Million bucks is, nor what it entials to "create" it ... another concept he probably lacks.  A well-formed goal for him would be more like: "My goal is to have a full time job next month and $1,000 in the bank by the end of the year."  That kind of thing is more "real" to him than One Million bucks.<br><br>Maybe you would say that he can "visualize" that more easily than the $1M.  Be that as it may, he does not need to go into a trance ... the simple statement of the goal brings enough awareness to allow problems to be foreseen.  If he plans to get a job, "interviews" and "want ads" probably pop right into his head.  If his goal is $M, his "visualization" is new cars, yachts, private jets, night clubs, snorting coke ;-)  all things that have to do with how he will FEEL once he has it and nothing at all to do with how he will have to act to get it and since that part is missing, the problems of demands on his time will also be.  So trancing out won't do it for him.  There is probably no way he can get that information from where he is right now.  He has to take smaller steps.<br><br>>>> It's an exaggerated but common enough example. However, if you're going to do something that requires planning and goals to be set, why not spend a few minutes visualizing what the outcome would actually feel like - especially if you're going to spend a large volume of work to accomplish it. Your wanne-be milliionnaire would more likely pick up on the desire to have a certain lifestyle, not have to work 80 hour week and do a job he loves while achieving his goal to a million dollars.

The problem was not lack of vision, but lack of proper measurement -- or maybe just a different goal than health.  Doctors are measured by time, (not creating a good outcome for the patient) so they limit time and medicine suffers.  That is not lack of vision, or visualization, it is simply a differing goal.  The insurance companies are not in the business of health, they are in the business of making money.  Until it starts to become expensive for them to have unhealthy patients they will continue as they have.  You don't seriously think these insurance executives (hospital administrators) would have a "vision session" and dream about smiling happy patients.  No, they'd dream of happy smiling executives with big performance bonus checks and private jets and all.<br><br>>>> Really, the brain is continually drawing and using visual information continually, whether you are conscious or not.  <<<<br><br>For those who are primarily visually oriented.

I see terminology as "Type", "Wing", etc.  But your point is still valid ... that is a boat load of terminology.

<div class="content">Isn't there also the problem that someone could have a wonderful SMART goal that they've envisioned and still not achieve it? If there is no success, does that mean that the SMART approach or mental rehearsal do not "work"? IMO if you have someone with sufficient motivation, the goal will be achieved barring external obstacles that cannot be overcome (e.g., I can be as motivated as possible to become the next American Idol, but I wouldn't make it past the screeners - lol). With enough motivation, supportive techniques like SMART either become automatic or irrelevant. With too little motivation, supportive techniques can assist goal achievement, but are not sufficient for success.</div>

But whenever someone in Employee Communications decides to boil it down into a poster with a few bullet points, it almost inevitably becomes worthy of mockery.<br><br>I guess the thing that gets you riled up is the "visionaries" are great at painting pictures and creating an overall impression of something grand, but fail to provide the concrete actions and details that are needed to make it a reality.   I think the right word for people like that is CHARLATAN. <br><br>But the thing that gets other people riled up are the "functionaries" who are pretty good at habitually setting SMART goals that attain their purpose, but aren't able to explain (to others or to themselves) WHY this particular goal is so important and useful and necessary, and therefore can't MOTIVATE anyone.<br><br>A real LEADER, it seems to me, is someone who can envision and articulate the large goals but also make them real, practical, SMART, with all the feedback systems and everything else you mention to make them really work, but also with answers to all the WHY questions that helps make sure they are the RIGHT goals and that people are motivated to work towards them.<br><br>Anyway, just some rambling thoughts...</div>

<div class="content">Mel,<br><br>"Becoming the next American Idol" is not a well-formed goal.  Why?  Because it is not within your control.  You can have a goal to become the best singer you can be.  You can also have a goal to write songs.  But if the outcome depends on the actions of others, the goal is not well-formed.  That is not to say that it is not a DESIRE to become the American Idol.  (Though why, I can't even begin to imagine ;-)  You can also have it as a goal to tryout for the competition.</div>

<div class="content">Mike:<br><br>I'm not sure you've thought this through completely. Like you I can't imagine why anyone would want to go in for American Idol (and even less for the British equivalent!), but surely you wouldn't stand much chance of winning an Olympic gold medal if your goal was "to tryout for the Olympics" or "become the best sprinter I can". <br><br>I'm pretty sure that all the Olympic gold medal winners have precisely "to win the gold medal for x" as their goal. Only one person in each event is going to succeed in their goal, but no one is going to stand a chance of winning if that is not their goal.<br><br>Whether they win or not depends just as much on the actions of others (the other competitors in the event) as in American Idol.</div>

<div class="content">Simon,<br><br>>>> Mike, the problem though is that "learn more" is basically the entire plan at the beginning. And if operating a hotel in the Rockies is one of say 15 or 20 "someday/maybe"-type items, then it's not really practical to take the steps that you've listed. I wouldn't move across the country just to explore a someday/maybe item. >>><br><br>There are other things that affect it.  Is it really a "someday/maybe" or is it a "goal".  Just because it is not coming to completion tomorrow does not mean it is "someday/maybe".  Secondly, there is the question of priority.  Yes, if you have 15 or 20 things all with the same priority, I'd say that none of them had any priority at all.  They are all just dreams.  If you really WANT to run that hotel, or whatever, then make it a goal and get to work on it.  It may happen that in your reading, and correspondence with other operators, and your subscription to hotel operators of the Rockies (or what ever ;-) you decide it is not for you.  Hopefully you learn that before you uproot and move.  That is why "learn more" is the first step in almost any project.<br><br>>>> This is where I always get stuck -- anything worth planning for always involves a huge amount of unknowns and often seems to break down at the "learn more" stage. If I already know all the steps, then why make a plan, unless I need to co-ordinate them all in a very short period of time? The appeal of the bottom-up approach is that you can keep 20 irons in the fire and then move forward on each iron as opportunity/more information arises. >>><br><br>I'm not sure what you are saying.  In the first part of that it seems that you have lots of unknowns and have to learn.  In the second you seem to know the steps.  I'm confused, again ;-)<br><br>>>> I was thinking though that one way of dealing with unknowns is to revise/rewrite the plan very regularly. How do other people deal with situations where 80% of the plan is unknown at the time of planning? <<<<br><br>I've seldom had plans for anything exciting that did NOT have that much or more unknown!  And yes, that is what planning really IS.  A plan is not static.  It must be revised regularly to take into account the changing situation.<br><br>My wedding plan, for example, was huge (as personal plans go).  I had it in a PERT/CPM system and stuck on the wall.  I would continually revise it:<br><br>- Find venue (can't make date work)<br>- - Hold it in my back yard.  Add all the tasks necessary to replace the lawn, deep clean the house, etc.<br><br>- Find minister (canceled at the last moment)<br>- - Find new minister<br><br>- All kinds of plans to shop for wedding dress<br>- - Lovely bride got her perfect dress from eBay for $80.00!!!  Scratch all those no longer needed tasks.<br><br>Each day, it seemed, I updated the plan with completions that involved additions, deletions,and modifications.  I could have winged it and we'd have been just as married.  But it would not have pleased her as much and weddings are all about the bride.  The groom is just there for decoration ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>I agree that goals can be worded in such a way as to make them dull.  But that is a choice, is it not?  Probably what they paid you to tell them was how to put the tinsel, lights and popcorn on the goals.  The problem is not with the goal, in this case, it is with how it is "presented".<br><br>And it also occurs to me it is a question of who you are talking to.  "Raise profit by 20%" or whatever, might be a really sexy goal to some people.  It just depends.</div>

<div class="content">Simon, Avrum,<br><br>"Backward Planning" is vanilla PERT/CPM.  You put a "bubble" at the extreem right of your page with the final outcome you wish.  Then you put to the left of that, bubbles for all of the things that have to happen for that to occur.  Continue the process for each "bubble" until you reach the point where every "bubble" on the extreem left of your page is something you could do today (or if not today, at least has no dependencies or things you have to do first ... IOW, some bubbles may just need to wait for some external event).  What you have now is a classic "network" of tasks with all dependencies shown.  If you wish to take it further, you add required resources, man hours (or clock hours) necessary to complete, etc.  If you put it into sofware, all of the tedious calculation is done to produce the "Critical Path" which shows you the items in the plan which, if they are not completed on time, will delay the project.<br><br>The concept is simple but the method is powerful.  I'd venture to say that we all do this subconsciously when we have any kind of goal.</div>

<div class="content">Apart from olympic gold,  I think exceptional goals can be reached just by participating:  <br>- The only Idol candidate I knew, was never there to win and ended up doing the World Idol stuff in 2003.  <br>- I also remember a discrete MP helping to distribute election fliers in mailboxes or something alike for a local election.

He then goes on to clarify why and look at different options - and how is that so dumb?  <<<<br><br>It is not so dumb, if that were what he said.

I suspect you and I have both written longer posts!! :-) <<<<br><br>I'm quite sure of that ;-)  I'd also say that either of us would write better posts than that article.  ;-)<br><br>>>>  I fully agree that planning is essential but not all the time. Now, I just know I am going to be shot down for this but hey, whatever ..... <<<<br><br><click, click><br><br>Your story had a happy outcome.  Yay for you!  ;-)  How many people dream such things and never get them?  My point is that if you really WANT something, you have to DO something.  And not only DO something, but do SOMETHING (in particular).  That is where a plan comes in.  Plans are only for people who really intend to get something in particular done.<br><br>I spent a while in Panama on a contract.  I learned some functional Spanish there and would like to improve it.  I've had this idea for some years now.  Do you know how much closer I am to that outcome?  I don't have a ruler calibrated in distances that small!  ;-)  The thing is, I have the books, and courses.  I know the theory of learning languages.  I have learned a few languages in the past.  But I have not laid out a PLAN, nor have I taken any action.  So I have exactly the result I "planned" for ... nothing.  I have the thought that I might, but not the specific intention.<br><br>My father died suddenly and I was really knocked for a loop.  It put me in the mind of "what have a always wanted to do but have put off".  Many, many years ago I flew in a small plane and loved it.  I had always "thought" I might "like to do that someday".  Decades passed.  My father died and I was "motivated".  Once I had the motivation, I began planning ... and if you think you can get a private pilot's license without a plan, dream on.  There is a staggering amount to learn ... and practice ... and amass the money for ... and make the time for.  Within a year after my father's death I was flying around the countryside.<br><br>Now I did eventually drop it.  It is expensive and once I had achieved my goal, and satisfied my desire, I could not justify the monumental expense.  But I got to my goal because I planned for it.  I planned for it because I was motivated and I moved through the plan because of other motivation.  Years (decades, actually) of feeling it would be wonderful to fly did not get me there.  Determination and a plan did.<br><br>So there are two counter examples with different outcomes.<br><br>Right now I want to move to the Midwest ... the very Arizona that some here wish they could move away from ;-)  I do NOT have a plan so nothing is getting done.  I don't like a lot of things about where I live now.  But the balance has not tipped yet.  There are many costs to consider and as of yet, I'm not sufficiently motivated.  Once I am (IF I am) I'll put in place an extensive plan.  I've moved before so I know the steps, but I would not work from memory on something this big ... I'd have a whole book full of plans and checklists.  And I'd change it all as I went along.<br><br>Just FWIW.<br></div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>O.K.  SMART goals (what I prefer to call "well-formed" goals.  So far as I know, nothing in the SMART formula restricts the wording.  It only dictates what bases you need to have covered.  For example, goals must be specific and measurable.  That could mean wording it as:<br><br>"I will have a private pilot's license by the end of this year."<br><br>or it could be worded as:<br><br>"I will have a private pilot's license by the end of this year so I can fly the open country and visit places I've never been before."<br><br>I don't see the well-formedness of a goal restricting it so much as assuring that the essentials are present.  The wording of a goal can be as rich or impoverished as one likes, I suppose.</div>

It was accurate and honest.  The only problem was that it is a flawed vision.  IBM has made money in some very disreputable ways and has largely lost the respect of the industry.

<div class="content"><br>Re Mike: Regarding terminology in psychology<br><br>yes there is a ton of terminology in psychology, I think the main struggle with the abundance of terminology is that it becomes harder for an average person to understand it unless it is accompanied by good examples or background knowledge.

I agree there are lot of meaningless visions around, especially in the corporate world and otherwise in terms of private lives with 'pie in the sky' visions. I think the interesting thing about a compelling vision is that it wears off even if it is enticing at first. Thinking about a million dollars over and over again gets boring to the mind if all you do is look at it. There's more to it. <br><br>I think what I like about visualisation and the list methods and things like 'describing your ideal day' is that those things tend to manifest without really being all too conscious of it during the journey to it - in a set it and forget it mode many a time. Just like Christine ended up with a view over a Marina without really planning it out in detail. And like you said about my million dollar example being an example of a poorly formed goal, i.e. what is the plan to getting a million? Again that's the freeing thing about a visualisation becaus you don't have to know the hows (and how could one anyway)<br><br>I think I agree with a quote that goes along the lines of 'fail to plan and you're planning to fail.' But how do you plan for something you have clear path toward like most objectives. Most people plan on trying to win the lottery or go to the best law school because that is all they can creatively come up with in order to obtain a goal like a million dollars. But the prior is as likely as winning a match again tiger woods and the latter is bound to setup you up for 50-80 hr work weeks. <br><br>I think the most rewarding effect of planning is that it reduces options (and potentially decreases stress) which compels action and action in turns leads to further clarity. So if 'Dude' who pursues a million dollars first tries the lottery and he gets disencouraged after losing a couple in a row, he may adapt his plan to the more elaborate law school option. And then when he realizes he's not really in the lifestyle he desires, he will creatively find a new plan. It would be nice to cut back on the dead-end roads, which again, envisioning helps with that because you're able to get more detail if you simply 'go their in your mind' rather than just employing methodical logic. <br><br>More importantly, when setting a SMART goal, the logical mindset is that it is centered around taking action and in contrast a vision can be achieved in some cases without expending much effort at all. It's the difference between working and traveling toward a goal. <br><br>RE Mark: elaboration of push & pull<br><br>thanks!</div>

<div class="content">Good Morning Peter,<br><br>WOW, such a juicy post this morning.  I love it.  Thanks so much ;-)<br><br>>>> Re Mike: Regarding terminology in psychology<br><br>yes there is a ton of terminology in psychology, I think the main struggle with the abundance of terminology is that it becomes harder for an average person to understand it unless it is accompanied by good examples or background knowledge. And even with this we need other people like philosophers to remind us of the use of words (like the word 'self', what is really referring to?) <<<<br><br>I agree but personally put the emphasis not so much on the difficulty the average person has, but the difficulty that even professionals have if they are not clear in their terminology.  And the moment one introduces a second word which makes no new distinction, one has taken away meaning, not added to it.  (Except in the case of poetry ;-)<br><br>The real danger occurs when a person thinks they see a dictinction and hastily coins a term for it and it is taken up unthinkingly by the rest of the herd and so the false distinction becomes encoded and goes unquestioned.<br><br>It is not always easy to avoid the trap of poor terminology.  I find myself often using the term "plan" when I really mean "goal".  Those are two different things but usage has become sloppy.  Likewise "project" and "goal" and "plan" are all different things.<br><br>>>> But even with examples one can always break them down no, you just put up the right angle. Like your response to the million dollar&policy maker example: valid points but within the example the intended illustration, which was also I think the intention of the article is that people tend to set smart goals that don't work, which isn't a direct attack at SMART goal as a technique.  <<<<br><br>I see this as a good example of how terminology gets us into trouble.  What does it mean to say that "SMART goals do not work"?  A "goal" does not "work".  A goal is an outcome one wishes.  It neither "works" nor "does not work".  It is the "plan" which "works" (or not).  And further, plans always "work" if they are well-formed plans.  (Meaning, in this case, that one views planning as a process including taking feedback from success and failure and modifying the "plan".)  If one views plan as static (as implied by the term "plan") then one might be tempted to say the plan failed ... what really failed was the "planER" ... or maybe better, the"planING".  In linguistic terminology, "plan" is a nominalization.  It is a verb made into a noun.  We have a nasty habit of reworking nouns and verbs in current English to make logical mush of what is really going on.  (Why do doctors feel the need to say "visualize" when they mean "see"?  Now there is one that gets my goat.  But that's another problem ;-)<br><br>>>> But if the terminology is there to describe something more specifically&succintly and we don't have different words for it, it's a necessary and useful thing.  <<<<br><br>Yeah, but we really owe it to ourselves to give it a shot, no?<br><br>>>> Confirmation bias for example is a great driver for discussion in that every person in a discussion while shine angles that illuminate different aspects unseen to the other party, since they are seeking information to comply with their beliefs and will juggle responses in such a way that it at least fits with their thinking. It does bring out a lot of useful detail, which wouldn't be possible if everybody would only exchange oneliners to the effect of 'sit down & shut up'. (Although I love the oneliners) <<<<br><br>One-liners have the virtue that they stimulate both thinking and debate.  When someone says "Sit down and shutup" (in the context in which you cite it) that stimulates my thinking.  "Does lack of motion help attention?  Does silence?  Well, they might help me.  Would they help everyone?  Do they always help me?"  Thus my somewhat terse retort: "And what?  Fall asleep?  Which was my one-liner (two-liner?) pointing out that sleep is one way to be quiet and not move and it would not result in attention being paid. <br><br>>>> I do agree with Jacqueline regarding the use of succint remarks. Losing specificity can open up ambiguity and therefore weakens the intended impact of the words. I admire Mark for his succint writing style but even with his writing there's the increasing potential of misunderstanding. I think great writers/speakers are the ones that manage that balance.  <<<<br><br>That is where the balance needs to be struck.  "Sit down ..." may stimulate debate but it is obviously not the answer ... as my retort illustrated, there is at least one case where it clearly fails.  One might better have said: "Perhaps pausing for a moment and shutting out distraction would make attention come more easily."  Better ... I can't make my remark about falling asleep then.  But still, I think there are other bases to cover that require more words.  How many is an open question.<br><br>>>> I've noticed one of the three best tips for writing emails is writing according to SMART. (the others are simply not writing at all and only formulating one question per email with proper (smart) phrasing) too bad I don't always follow those tips... <<<<br><br>Well, to quote someone or other (debate rages as to who said it ;-) "I'm writing you this long letter because I did not have time to write a shorter one."  It takes time to write well.  My writing has deteriorated over the last years mostly because of the Internet.  There is so much that I want to respond to but I don't have the time to do it well.  Thank Zeus (I'm trying to be specific here ;-) for spell checkers.<br><br>I was brought up to have a topic for any communication.  To lay out an argument.  To present each part of the argument in its own paragraph.  To have a topic sentence, supporting information, and a summary for each paragraph.  Now arguments become muddied.  Paragraphs are often more for visual effect than logical.<br><br><br>>>> Re Mike: Regarding vision:<br><br>I think I know understand your stance on vision.

Thinking about a million dollars over and over again gets boring to the mind if all you do is look at it. There's more to it. <<<<br><br>I agree with that.  I also think that it gets more boring because it can NOT be visualized by most people.  If you ask a $15K clerk how much he would like to be paid if he might say $30K, thinking that was a lot of money.  Let's assume his name is NOT "Dude" and so he works hard and in a year he has made $30K.  Ask him again and he might say $58K or something.  A year later, he might say $85K.  The point is that what he thinks that "a lot of money" is, depends on where he stands when asked.  So "Dude" can say all he wants about $1M but he has NO idea what that is, or what it takes to get there.  He is too far away.  He needs his "vision" to be something he can "see".<br><br>And that is my problem with vision statements.  They are often vague, improbably, and just not useful.<br><br>My second problem is that they are often used INSTEAD OF goals and plans and actions.  There is a whole bunch of new-age crapola (largely coming out of the Transcendentalist movement in philosophy) in which visualizing is held to be enough.  That is simply destructive. <br><br>>>> I think what I like about visualisation and the list methods and things like 'describing your ideal day' is that those things tend to manifest without really being all too conscious of it during the journey to it - in a set it and forget it mode many a time.  <<<<br><br>See, that is where the wheels come off the cart for me.  If you want something you have to do something.  "Set it and forget it" leaves it up to chance.<br><br>>>> Just like Christine ended up with a view over a Marina without really planning it out in detail. And like you said about my million dollar example being an example of a poorly formed goal, i.e. what is the plan to getting a million? Again that's the freeing thing about a visualisation becaus you don't have to know the hows (and how could one anyway) <<<<br><br>An example of an intuitive goal: "I'd love to live by the water."<br>Actions taken: None<br>Results achieved:<br><br>- A year later having the good fortune to find a nice home with an ocean view, or<br>- A year later being hit by lightening and killed, or<br>- A year later, thinking "I'd love to live by the water."<br><br>Now which is the more likely outcome?<br><br>Visualization can tickle the RAC and so get us to notice things, become aware of opportunities, etc.  But if the opportunities do not come by CHANCE, there will be no good outcome.  In order to GET what you want, for sure, you have to take some action.<br><br>>>> I think I agree with a quote that goes along the lines of 'fail to plan and you're planning to fail.'<<<<br><br>One of those silly one-liners <blush>  ;-)<br><br><<< But how do you plan for something you have clear path toward like most objectives.  <<br><br>That is EXACTLY what planning is all about.

But the prior is as likely as winning a match again tiger woods and the latter is bound to setup you up for 50-80 hr work weeks.  <<<<br><br>And the former is a bad plan while the latter is a plan that succeeds.  It only fails if your goal was to be HAPPY and have a million dollars.  It is possible (indeed all too common) to make a good plan to archive a poorly conceived goal.<br><br>>>> I think the most rewarding effect of planning is that it reduces options (and potentially decreases stress) which compels action and action in turns leads to further clarity.  <<<<br><br>A really good way of putting it!<br><br>>>> So if 'Dude' who pursues a million dollars first tries the lottery and he gets disencouraged after losing a couple in a row, he may adapt his plan to the more elaborate law school option. And then when he realizes he's not really in the lifestyle he desires, he will creatively find a new plan.  <<<<br><br>That is exactly how it works!  Planing -> action -> feedback -> revised plan -> action -> feedback -> etc.<br><br>>>> It would be nice to cut back on the dead-end roads, which again, envisioning helps with that because you're able to get more detail if you simply 'go their in your mind' rather than just employing methodical logic.  <<<<br><br>I am not arguing against envisioning.  I'm arguing that it is not sufficient, that it is misunderstood, and that it can lead to the WRONG road.  So what if Dude decides that he wants a million.  He then visualizes.  From where does he draw his mental movie?  From glamor and fan magazines?  From Hollywood films about rich and famous people in fast cars and jets?  Without "methodical logic" that is all he has access to.  He does not know, personally, any millionaires.  He has to rely on what is fed to the public.  And so he will go down the wrong road just as readily as if he drew his conclusions any other way.  He will end up working 80 hour weeks and finally, only after getting there, realize that 80 hour weeks is ALL there is.  No jets.  No fast cars.  No time to fly or drive.  But that was not in his vision so he did not see it.  In one sense, the vision hurt him as it kept him from seeing that he was on the wrong path.  Much of this envisioning is akin to putting out your own eyes so you don't see that you are going down the wrong road.<br><br>>>> More importantly, when setting a SMART goal, the logical mindset is that it is centered around taking action and in contrast a vision can be achieved in some cases without expending much effort at all. It's the difference between working and traveling toward a goal. <<<<br><br>But as I hope I have illustrated, working is neither a bad thing nor something there is any way around.<br><br>Thanks for this thoughtful post.  I enjoyed it.</div>

<div class="content">Mike, I have struggled with this one, and I never liked that advice about "find exercise you enjoy" or even worse, "if you don't do exercise that you enjoy then it won't last" or "find a buddy to exercise with" (expecting the "accountability" factor to solve the problem.) (Not sure if getting a dog would work!!) At any rate, finally I HAVE found some exercise that I DO really like (kind of a miracle for me) which I LOOK FORWARD to and MAKES ME FEEL GOOD and THAT is why I actually do it... because I WANT to, not because it is something I am "supposed" to do, that is a discipline. So ... FWIW, maybe just keep trying to find some form of movement that actually feels good to you? <br><br>(For me, it has been qigong, specifically I am using the DVDs by the Garripoli's .. there is enough variety on the 3 DVDs to keep my practice fresh .. I mainly use the "Qigong for detox" because it is both relaxing/ energizing but I also really like their Qigong for Stress Relief and Qigong for Beginners.

<div class="content">I wonder Mark, with Autofocus, whether you are closer to that vision of the Future Self you created in the opening pages of the "Dreams" book. I suspect you are, what with the storm of excitement AF has created. :)<br><br>Goals are such a huge topic wherever they are discussed, and the "Dreams" book was one of the few I felt I could relate to, as it discussed extensively the internal battles that rage when a goal is set. Staying the course is half the battle won, imho.<br><br>I am revisiting the dog eared pages again, thanks to this extensive discussion, and hope to renew and re-energise.  Some long term goals have, over time, become stale and atrophied but still resonate internally because at the time I committed to them after reading the book, they were fresh and full of feeling that I generated by seeing the end result. Over time, they became relegated to the back-end of thought, and every now and then, the tasks associated with them bring back memories of a child-like excitement I had.<br><br>More than ever, I am convinced that goals have to resonate with the senses, or they lose meaning and purpose via the path of least resistance.<br><br>This thread has been a fascinating read.

<div class="content">Bev,<br><br> I like your approach because it gets to the core of things.  What I want, really, is to feel better.  I had lost my focus on that point.  I'm not interested in eating better or exercising more because I "should", but because those things will make me feel better (i.e. be more healthy and so have less discomfort).  That is the long term goal.  It only makes sense to devise short term actions which focus on the same thing.<br><br>I used to run.  I was a running fool.  I think that, in part, is what is causing me so much knee pain later in life.  When I was in my 30's, I went back to get a degree in computer science at UCLA.  Every day, at about 11:00, I'd run the perimeter of the campus ... and it is a huge campus.  In fact, I even laid the groundwork for my meditation practice at that point.  I found that the only way I could do it was to "trance out" while running, and focus on my internal sensations.  That was then and this is now (many pounds later).  But the point is I really loved doing that.  I looked forward to it every day.  I did not do it because I had to.<br><br>Now running is out.  Jogging is out.  Walking is in, but I'm not sure I love it so much.  I'm going to have to do some "field research" ;-) to find something I like.<br><br>Thanks for getting me thinking in this direction.

<div class="content">Hey Mark,<br><br>>>> I see three limitations of SMART goals:<br>1. They achieve nothing without a plan  <<<<br><br>I'm not sure why you see that to be a limitation. Looking at it from the reverse:<br><br>- Anything you want requires some action<br>- The actions taken need to be those that get you where you want to go<br>- Those actions are selected by means of a PLAN<br>- The PLAN is devised keeping the GOAL in mind.<br><br>>>> 2. They are open to unintended consequences<br><br>Pretty much every action is, no?<br><br>>>>  3. They focus attention<br><br>Admit it now, you put that in there just to tantalize me ;-)<br><br>>>> Dude's "$1m in the bank by the time I'm 30" is a perfectly SMART goal. It must be achievable and realistic: lots of other people do it.<br><br>I can't disagree in principle, but in practice I wonder if it is indeed realistic.  Look, the guy is high on Mary Jane and has no clue what $1 million is, let alone what he could do to get it or how long it would take.  True, lots of people do it but then lots of people have it together.  I would consider it a better goal if the amount and time frame were shorter.  Or the goal were "staged" (i.e. "$10K in the bank this year leading me to my eventual goal of $1M in the bank by age 30.")  It is really not appropriate to judge what is realistic for others, but I think that a smaller chunk might be better in Dude's case.<br><br>>>> But:<br><br>1. without some very rigorous planning it is worthless.<<<<br><br>Yes.  Of course.<br><br>2. And with that planning it could be worse than useless, taking him somewhere he didn't really want to go.<br><br>That is what I was saying earlier.  It would take him where he has DECIDED he wants to go, it won't necessarily take him to a place he will be happy with when he gets there.  That is why I view planning as a process, rather than a static document.  After Dude's first year trying to save $10K (from his better goal) from his job flipping burgers at the Big Mac Supper Club, he will almost certainly become disillusioned in some way.  Depending on what way, he will adjust his plan:<br><br>- I'll never get there flipping burgers ... I'd better go to business school, or<br>- Man, this working is the pits.  I'm going to Hawaii and surf for a living.<br><br>>>> 3. While he's focusing "like a laser beam" (love that phrase - so right emotionally and so wrong technically)<br><br>Just interested, why is it wrong technically?  Laser light is "coherent" and scatters much less, no?<br><br>>>> on getting his banking degree, he's missing<br><br>a. opportunities for voluntary service which would have taken him overseas and introduced him to interesting people - which were really what he wanted all along   <<<<br><br>Yes, that is probably true.  Every choice eliminates other opportunities.  No getting away from it.  But how can he know that at the end of a long series of events he will arrive at someplace he would eventually like better than what he envisions now?  It is just as reasonable to make the argument that if he "drifted" and made those connections and met interesting people, he would have longed for the $1M he wished he had persued.  The future is always up for grabs, no?<br><br>Maybe that is why I love planning so much ... you keep questioning where you are and where you are going.<br><br>>>> b. early warnings that the banking system is rotten<br><br>That's a tough problem.  I can tell you personally that I headed off in the wrong direction and did not realize how much I would really HATE management until I got there.  It goes so much against my character.  I'm not sure what I might have done to become aware of it early enough to have avoided the trap.  I mean, it was the defined "path of success" in my industry.  Programmers don't make it very far unless they are so far above the pack that they work in the research labs running their own projects ... and even then, they find themselves sucked into management of some kind or other.  It was not until I actually had to DO the management tasks, day in and day out, that I realized how awful it was.  From the outside looking in, I just don't see how I could have known.  But more to the point, I DID not know.  And I'm not sure how taking my eye off the ball would have shown me.  I knew managers since forever, and liked a lot of them.  It is not so much the people who I don't like, it is the system.  It is profoundly antithetical to my world-view.<br><br>>>> A rigorously developed vision has different limitations.<br><br>1. It doesn't guarantee where you will end up - only that it will be better in some way than where you are now  <<<<br><br>Yes, I can see that.<br><br>>>> 2. It doesn't guarantee timing. If you're English and you need a Russian visa next week, you'd better have a pretty detailed plan and track it by the hour!  <<<<br><br>Yes, I see that as well.<br><br>>>> 3. it dilutes attention across multiple opportunities and threats <<<<br><br>I can see it doing that to me.  I'm not sure that there are not people who would not have some mechanism which would allow them to pick something and cut off others.  I mean, wouldn't the vision allow certain people to select the best course because it better fit the vision than other courses?<br><br>>>> So if Dude was clear that he wanted to see lots of interesting places, meet lots of interesting people, be interesting himself and have plenty of the colour olive green, he could develop these (more specific about what is interesting about places and people, for instance).<br><br>And then one day he's off to a fencing competition in the park when he notices that he's passing a recruiting office for the marines. Nice colour scheme... <<<<br><br>ROTFLMAO ;-)<br><br>>>> Or a he's reading the Economist <<<<br><br>Dude reads the Economist?  Now THAT IS a stretch ;-)<br><br>>>> and sees an article on the resurgence of voluntary service overseas...<br><br>Or a blog that he follows mentions an internship in a leading edge marketing consultancy with some of the most interesting people in business... <<<<br><br>But does that not just push the problem back a step?  Now he has to decide if he is going to be a marketing consultant and if so, how?  So he's back into planning that path ... or drifting some more until he reads the next blog and sees the next shiny object, no?<br><br>>>> Visioning becomes more important when the environment is chaotic in the mathematical sense that a small change can have a large and unpredictable effect.  <<<<br><br>IOW, following a vision rather than a plan makes more sense when there is less known?  I see why you say that, I think, but I can also see that planning handles unknowns as well ... assuming you see planning as an ongoing process with plenty of feedback.<br><br>In another post you say:<br><br>>>> One thing I don't think I emphasized enough when writing the "Dreams" book is that the vision of the Future Self has to change and evolve as you work on it. That is why the vision itself is regularly revised as well as the current situation.<br><br>It's only by working on the vision in this way that you can identify what you really want. My vision now would be very different from what it was at the start of the book. <<<<br><br>I guess I'm not sure what the difference between "visioning" and "planning" are.  It seems as if they are the same except that you don't say what you are going to actually do.  You set a "goal = vision", and then stop before you actually think about what you could do to accomplish it?<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">"I used to run. I was a running fool. I think that, in part, is what is causing me so much knee pain later in life"<br><br>Mike: You may know what follows, as you sound like a very serious runner. However, just in case you don't:  over time, we forget that we need to ensure that we land on the balls of our feet when running, because running shoes are built with plenty of cushion and padding, and with the constant pounding, we tend to land on our heels. <br><br>If you run with your shoes off, you will notice that we have the immediate instinct to take off and land on the balls of your feet. That provides the skeletal framework with plenty of support and spring it needs to prevent lower back and knee problems. <br><br>I recall seeing this in a video, but have since lost that link to post here.  I'm a bit of a jogger/runner myself, and over time developed a lower back issue. My experience with this has been that I have been able to run quite effectively, and held back the huge knee and lower back issues that crop up after each and every run. I was so thrilled with the results, that I ran almost every day, and my back caved in again :)  <br><br>I'm waiting for it to heal before I start again, but this time with a little more common sense!</div>

<div class="content">Re Mike & others: 1 million dollar goal continued<br><br>Part of what you have touched on is that a goal that is too far for a person to 'see' as you've put it hampers both the ability to plan and the ability to visualize. I think that is the common experience when people reach for something that is a number of steps outside the range of their current experience. Goals too small don't inspire, and goals to big can overwhelm or be hard to visualize & plan for.<br><br> I think a case can be made that with the process of planning, at least you can just plan the next step that seems to be toward the goal. A plan of course doesn't have to entail having a complete action list ready for the whole journey from the moment you begin (a false belief many procrastinators have!).<br><br>Another person said that 'Dude's' 1 million dollar goal was empoverished. I don't automatically agree with that. Like Mike mentions, when left to visualising, a lot of people, depending on where they are in life, will draw inspiration from things like glamor and fan magazines, picturing fast cars etc. <br><br>I think one shouldn't forget that on the way to working toward an 'empoverished' goal is that you'll glean life experience that is worthwhile and productive regardless of the 'superficiality of your desire. <br><br>To tred a little in the 'new age' crapola, when a movie like the Secret comes along, a lot of people will visualize things like cars, bigger houses, checks and so forth. Which has lead many to view this movie as proliferating among other things a sense of superficial thinking. <br><br>What a lot of self made millionaires admit is that they often, like many others, did chase after things like cars and a flashy lifestyle, only to discover that the goal felt empty on achievement. You might be able to credit this to superficiality, in which case most people to some degree operate very superficial (even the supposedly smart ones). <br><br>Much like you say Mike, a goal/plan works if it is well formed. The same goes for visualising. That's why I like an exercise like 'describe the ideal day'. Which is very powerful because it gets your mind to think about what a good day would might look like, down to the seemingly trivial details like who cooks your dinner, from the topic of conversation to what your friends are like. These are details seldom involved in the development of Smart goals in corporate and private life. <br><br>At times I ask my clients what a perfect work day looks like. What are the customers saying about your service, what is the team chemistry like, what kind of results do your customers get, what hours do I leave the office and do I think about work outside of work hours, and so forth. I think it's a very powerful method that is almost like 'set and forget'. <br><br>But this is a more immersive form of visualisation which you might call 'well-formed' visualisation. And so the same might be said: well-formed visualisation always works, if it holds true for well-formed plans. (I'm not stating either perse)<br><br>What I find so crucial to this is that visualisation is such a pervasive brain process, you are doing it whether conscious of it or not. To think about the achievement or process of attaining a goal means 'seeing it complete', you have to draw something up in order to be able to even think about it.<br><br>RE: the realisticness of 'set and forget' goal setting<br><br>What I think Mike basically says about 'setting and forgetting' is that it's like leaving things up to chance. I think the important distinction is that in planning you believe much in your conscious planning ability and in the 'set and forget' style, the 'magic' happens through subconscious planning, a process which I think is much more powerful!<br><br>I think to set and forget a 'destination' actually works quite well as long as the destination is described as pretty precise & unique. Although I would further specify the 'forget' part of the equation more specifically to 'to not have to actively think about it in order for it to happen'. We do this all the time. When I didn't have many appointments in my calendar, I used to be able to memorize a date&time without effort and I would automatically remember without fail. Even when setting an alarm in the morning my body gets up just before it goes off. These are just very basic unimpressive examples, but the ability for the mind to act out responses without having to consciously keep thinking about it is very underrated. Most people don't need alarms if they would exercise their trust in their own minds abilities.<br><br>Take for instance the experience of anxiety. Anxious people are excellent subconscious planners! Their bodies know exactly when to feel fear, all the mind/body need is when the circumstances  are happening and the body will plan anxiety for you. The fear of public speaking for example occurs anywhere from a few days to a few minutes before presenting. If the body/mind knows when it's presenting, it's going to plan the fear responses - even if your active 'conscious mind' is thinking about other things.  <br><br>For more involved goals however, I think what explains the phenomenon I have had many times in where I've felt like I've done a simple set and forget goal setting session and achieved the outcome with very little effort on my part, is that preceding experience has pre-paved a developed sense of clarity. My mind knows what to go for, even if I'm not paying conscious attention to it. <br><br>It's a bit like having listened to many radiostations and knowing what music I like and don't like. Once I sit down and write down the precise radiostation I want to listen to, I have a much easier time tuning in to the precise frequency. A goal setting session is then the equivalent of determining the radiostation. <br><br>The most success I've had have been with housing situations and relationships. Two types of 'outcomes' that are hard to make plans for. <br><br>To pick the latter, how does one 'plan' for a romantic partner? I think this example typifies why I think the 'having to work for everything' philosophy isn't a sound one, even if it sounds like a strong value. For one of the most important goals/experience that most people share: to have a partner/wife/husband, people don't carry out a step by step plan. One is much less inclined to think that if I just put in hard work I can get a partner. For most people, attracting a partner just happens, completely unplanned for. If something as pivotal as attracting a life partner doesn't typically really involve planned & deliberate effort, how come all other goals should have to? Is it really like leaving things up to chance? I don't think it's that clear cut. <br><br>I think a very refreshing exercise is to make a list of things that need to be done, but you don't want to carry them out yourself. Just write down 'to be carried out by other forces'. Write down the things and see what happens. Strike thought 'done items' when they are resolved. A good portion will be resolved without having to interfere with it yourself ( and sometimes much better than you could have). Of course, brushing your teeth isn't one of 'm:)<br></div>

<div class="content">I've always struggled with the "ideal day" concept. My first thought is reading by the beach in Cancun. Massage in the morning, dinner with husband and friends in the evening. Ideal! But I wouldn't want to do it every day. Neither can I describe an ideal work day scenario that I'd want to repeat multiple times. For me, the ideal is often spontaneity and the unexpected. A friend I haven't seen for ages drops by and we hang out by the pool. My child finally gets a concept he's never been able to grasp. Something uproariously funny happens that I want to remember forever. Every day can't be like that, nor would I want that. I think I have stuck with AF so long not because it's a schedule I live by day in and day out, but because it's varied and fresh and often unexpected. I'm often surprised by what's on the next page. Some of my ideal days have me whipping through that list and working on 60 tasks, but others have me resting and doing whatever occurs to me. I think I need to spend less time doing things to reach an ideal and more time seeing the ideal in what I'm doing.</div>

<div class="content">Great comments Mel. I too thought about that when doing that exercise. What I did was describe a number of days that would be typical of a month. That way I could include the less frequent aspects like wanting to travel a few days per month or maybe a week (I'd go nuts having to travel all the time). Doing certain activities on certain days of the week (not necessarily fixed), like playing basketball. Even expressing how in the winter I'd be visiting our winter abode. <br><br>I think the main thing is that you invoke enough detail. Like how your lifestyle would be ideally like, there are elements to it that would have to true for it to be as varied as you describe. Like not having to be tied up to a schedule. Not feeling anxious about certain topics, like weight or work commitments. Those are all qualities that would be arising from your 'ideal day' daily chatter that you could describe. You can definitely lift out many aspects that are true for your flexible lifestyle. <br><br>But you don't have to describe with the intention of describing the ideal sequence of activities, as if you have stick to certain meals when you wanted a varied choice. Let's say a person today looks at the people around him/her and takes note of what the usual conversations they have in their head and with friends/colleagues, how one feels about oneself. Let's say one has crappy friends who like to whine on and on about the economy, or people who gossip or talk politics (pick your poison). Or maybe you're constantly fighting with your neighbours or family. From that platform you can describe the opposite, the types of conversations you'd prefer to be happing on a daily basis. <br><br>"I feel fit and refreshed when doing my morning exercise. I love that I my meals are prepared for me and are both delicious and good for my health. My partner and I talk about how we are anticipating our next traveling adventure during breakfast. At lunch when I eat with friends we have silly fun and reminisce old times. My colleagues speak highly of me. Eight of ten customers that talk with us share how much they liked our service..." and so on and so forth.<br> <br>The short term effect of this is that you're much more likely to retrain your environment to what you are wanting to focus on. Which amounts to finding the ideal in the present moment. That might mean skipping the daily gossip, avoiding news broadcasts or taking up a leisure activity. Those minor actions can make a huge difference. While crude, it sometimes makes a huge difference to move away from people that are draining and an exercise like the above is a great way to make it more obvious how people are influencing your day to day experience in ways that you actually have a choice over. <br><br>In other words it helps taking charging of what you are going to put your attention on, because you are paying attention to details you'd ordinarily take for granted or not give notice to.</div>

<div class="content">Peter,<br><br>Picky point for the record only.<br><br>The problem I had with "have $1m" as a vision is the lack of detail. If he wants the glamour, then surely he needs to have much more than an abstract numerical concept?<br><br>Isn't it closer to a SMART goal than a vision?<br><br>This is really just a semantic game: it is clear that you see detail as important in visioning (just as Mike sees that it's important in planning).

<div class="content">Peter, I believe in the power of visualizing our goals. I was just saying that I couldn't conceive of a single "ideal" day. I have to chuckle at "my colleagues speak highly of me." I have found that the more successful I am in a given area, the less highly my "colleagues" speak of me. Would that I could visualize the former into existence. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">I think that the "ideal day" concept comes into its own more when someone is totally living a life at odds with what their dream lifestyle is.  In Sher's book, it was the truckdriver who wanted to own a dairy farm.<br><br>Years ago when I first did this, I described a day where I went to work and what type of team atmosphere that I worked in and what kind of work I did, etc.  Looking back on it today, about three years after writing about that ideal day, I did end up in an atmosphere exactly like that - and just as I had hoped, it was all that I knew it would be and I loved going to work every Monday.  :-)<br><br>When you come up with a description of an ideal day (or better yet, ideal life), you should come up with what Sher calls your "touchstones" - the core of that dream .  Even without the "ideal life" (like the million dollars) - how can you start putting something of that touchstone in your life right now?<br><br>What kind of relationships do you want to have in your life?  <br>What kind of person is your ideal self and character?<br>What do you do for recreation?<br>What kind of environment do you live in?  <br>What kind of work are you doing?<br>What is your physical body like?<br><br>You can use this as a basis for a gratitude practice and go through and highlight everything you have right now that fits into that ideal life and be appreciative of it.  <br><br>Then go to work on where there's a big disconnect between your ideal and your present state.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">As Jacqueline says the "ideal day" visualization is supposed to be of a typical working day, not of a some sort of special day. It's more about the environment you work in, the atmosphere, the background (e.g. debt-free), the type of work and how you feel about it all, than about specific actions. If you do include specific actions in it, then they are included as examples of the sort of things you would be doing.</div>

<div class="content">Hey Bev, <br>I've always believed there's a lot of value in est/Landmark etc.  I don't regret going through that program - the trick is not to throw the baby out with the bathwater.<br><br>I can't recall what you're referring to - I tend to remember other people's writing fairly well, but I don't re-read what I write - so I don't remember it. :-)  It sounds like something I would say though.  I used to drive my team crazy by saying "it's easy" a lot.  They'd say "it's not easy - or "maybe it's easy for you, but not for me."  I'd always tell them that if they said that it was easy / possible - then a) they acknowledge that there IS a solution - they just have identified it - yet; and b) it's probably blindingly obvious, we just have to look at things a different way.<br><br>Here's a summary of Goss' book:<br><a href="http://www.frumi.com/images/uploads/TheLastWordonPower.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.frumi.com/images/uploads/TheLastWordonPower.pdf</a><br>(even if you just read p. 12 - reading that makes me feel as powerful as I did coming out of the Forum.  Must have been something in the kool-aid that's causing flashbacks after all these years.)  :-)<br><br>Here's a wonderful website on creative thinking by the author of "Thinkertoys" and "Cracking Creativity" (Michael Michalko):<br><br><a href="http://www.creativethinking.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.creativethinking.net</a><br><br>And here's an excerpt from one of his articles:<br><br>Like nature, the contents of creative genius aren’t contained anywhere but also are revealed by the dynamics.  When you look at the behaviors of creative geniuses such as Leonardo daVinci, Thomas Edison, Albert Einstein, Pablo Picasso and so on throughout the history of the world, you will find that, like the patterns of nature, the form and contents of their behaviors are inextricably connected and can’t be separated.  Creators have the intention to create, and act and speak in a positive and joyful manner.  Creators look at what is and what can be instead of what is not.  Instead of excluding possibilities, creators consider all possibilities, both real and imagined.  Creators interpret the world for themselves and disregard the interpretations of past thinkers.  Creators learn how to look at things in different ways and use different ways of thinking.  And most importantly, creators are creative because they believe they are creative and have the intention to create.</div>

<div class="content">Bev, I am so very excited for you!!   I'm doing the same kind of thing in about 7 months - I think of it as creating a vacuum for fun things to appear.  :-)<br><br>"What would you do if you absolutely knew you could not fail?" <br><br>seems as weak a question as "What is achievable?" <br><br>when compared to an Impossibility:<br><br>"What is it that, even absolutely knowing you will fail, you would still choose to do?"<br><br>Then you back away from the outcome - because the outcome doesn't matter.   And focus on the practice, and love of that practice.  And if you're following your love for that practice, you can never fail anyway - so in fact, you have succeeded.  <br><br>That reminds me of a bunch of years ago when I would work on my goals and I'd always have some kind of financial target and I could never seem to push myself to save enough or make more - I'd always seem to sabotage myself in one way or another and my luck never seemed to be very good either. :-)<br><br>Then I finally had my own epiphany that what I wanted money for wasn't for the sake of accumulation (like my miser father/uncles) or ego (like my brothers) or anything really but the chance to be free and to get more of an opportunity to do things I really enjoyed and felt were challenging.  At that point, I started working at jobs that promised me a relatively large amount of freedom within employment.  Yet these jobs were also substantially higher paying - go figure.  (learning as I go - accounting is like one big sudoku game to me...I love it! )  :-) <br><br>Once I came to the realization however that I wanted freedom, it was like buying 'things' began to represent a loss of freedom to me.  My big house was more to clean, more books meant clutter, etc etc.  It became super easy to save because I had nothing I wanted to spend on - my life was complete - and because I loved my jobs and did well in them other opportunities appeared.  <br><br>But my point is - that yes, I could have won $$ on a lottery ticket (maybe not since I've never bought a ticket) and bought my "freedom" instantly.  But I think I would have lost that $ in the end because I wouldn't have learned the lessons from the pursuit - and realized that it was there all along.  <br><br>Sorry for the rambling - my mind races when I'm excited and I need time to process things....  :-)<br></div>

Yes, there is a market for material to help the retired start a "second life".  <br><br>Actually, there is a hell of a market for things marketed to seniors, if you are looking for emerging markets.  As a card carrying senior, I can tell you that the way the world works presents many challenges to seniors.<br><br>-  Readable documents, web pages, etc.  Hey, we can't read fine print without a microscope!<br><br>- Quiet places.  The continual din of music in stores and restaurants really begins to grate after a while.<br><br>- Louder AND more clear communication.  It is hard enough to hear over the phone at times, but when the speaker has forsaken all consonants and just kind of "drools" his/her speech, it is almost impossible.<br><br>- I don't know if anyone really can grasp what tech support personnel are saying when it is in India, but I know it is hard for me.<br><br>- Simpler devices.  I'm a technically oriented person and I'm even starting to have trouble with the virtually infinite options managed by small switches and buttons.  I think Apple is on the right track in this case.<br><br>- Simpler contracts, plans, rules, systems, etc. ... in general.  It is like cutting through a jungle to untangle a health plan document, or auto insurance, or home owners insurance policy.  Good grief ... it just gets harder every year.  I don't know if it is just getting harder because I'm getting older or because the documents themselves are more complex.  Probably some of both.  I mean, buying a 1/2 $M home is a big deal, but the contract is relatively short and nicely laid out in numbered paragraphs that are mostly comprehensible.  Why can't my health plan be that easy to understand?  Sheeesh!<br><br>- Seniors lose driving privileges (or should) when they can no longer see well or react quickly or even make decisions.  This is going to lead to a HUGE section of the population who are relatively immobile.  There is going to be an increasing market in home services.  And an increasing problem with fraud.  The possibilities are endless.<br><br>- Money!  You are an accountant.  How much bigger will the market be for those who need help understanding investments and such ... making sound decisions about selling their homes, reverse mortgages, selling down IRAs, etc.?  Trivial to you, rocket science to most of the older folk.<br><br>Yes, some will want to go back to work, and there is a market there.  At some point, all will need more support.</div>

Thanks for reminding me I really WANTED this space! lol  I do love this question: <br><br>--------<br>> an Impossibility: "What is it that, even absolutely knowing you will fail, you would still choose to do?"<br><br>Then you back away from the outcome - because the outcome doesn't matter. And focus on the practice, and love of that practice. And if you're following your love for that practice, you can never fail anyway - so in fact, you have succeeded. <br>--------<br><br>I am still waiting for my own "epiphany" of sorts ... where I sense an integration of all the various bits of me that don't quite harmonize, yet ...<br><br>> the chance to be free and to get more of an opportunity to do things I really enjoyed and felt were challenging. <br><br>YES! this is the direction ....  :o)</div>

<div class="content">Bev, have you ever read Barbara Sher's book "Refuse to Choose"?  It's the best book I know for someone looking for integration of all of their various interests - or a clue as to how to incorporate all of them in your career / business.  You don't commit to nothing - you commit to everything that interests you.  <br><br>I also found useful Herminia Ibarra's book "Working Identity" - Unconcentional Strategies for Reinventing your Career.   She has examples in there of people who were self-employed, not just people with jobs.<br><br>I think the key to both of them is that you generally don't find those a-ha moments in introspection and navel-gazing, you find them in actively going out and trying things on and using what you've learned about yourself in those new situations to refine what you want.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline ... I've not heard of either of those books! Thanks so much!  :o) I will check them out. You are my muse. :o)  I appreciate your reminder not to restrict my time waiting for the "epiphany" to the navel-gazing, but to actively try things on!  :o)<br><br>(I would love there to be a "renovation" in my future, so I am also following your home stories with interest.)<br><br>(Not sure exactly when you are leaving for holidays, but do have a wonderful vacation! and we are already looking forward to your return !!  :o)   )</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline, how 'chunky' is the 'refuse to choose" book by Barbara Sher? Is it one of those books that can be encapsulated in a few pages or is it really worth reading the whole thing? Made a bit too many book purchases lately~!<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Peter, here's the first 33 pages on google books.  You can get a pretty good feel for the material from the introduction.  I hear you on the buying side - it gets so pricy - and since I've been giving away a whole bunch of books, it pains me to think of how much I spent and makes me think three times before buying another!  :-(<br><br><a href="http://books.google.ca/books?id=xGVRPZA238sC&printsec=frontcover&dq=refuse+to+choose" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.ca/books?id=xGVRPZA238sC&printsec=frontcover&dq=refuse+to+choose</a></div>

<div class="content">Thanks Jacqueline! I've been reading through the preview. I have at least 10 books that are being read 'little and often', mostly newly purchased, some based on forum recommendations. The purchases do add up quickly though, especially if they are charging over 10$ a book. I found Barbara Sher's wishcraft online freely available which is another one I want to read through!</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>Re: Methods:  I hear 'ya.  OTOH, things are perhaps changing just a bit.  Governments depend on the largest part of the population being somewhat docile.  The largest part of the population is now aging and growing quickly.  Over this side of the pond, the political landscape is almost hysteria over a medical system reform plan.  Most years it has been talked about but quietly scuttled, but now it won't go away.  I think it is because too many people are now directly affected and most of them are becoming "fearless".  I dunno.<br><br>All of the methods you mention work very well, but maybe less so if they have to be applied to millions of people.  OTOH, I'm not so sure of anything.  I'd have thought by now that the idiocy of near strip searches to get on a plane would have blown up in the faces of the government (especially since the only people they do NOT stop are the actual terrorists)!  Yet we still seem to be quite docile as we chew our collective cud.  Maybe when the ACLU case about invasion of privacy with the new scanner that sees through clothes makes it to the Supremes we'll have a better read on things.<br><br>Re: For your own good:  Yes, of course, as always.  I was on vacation last week and at dinner we got a receipt for the drink my wife ordered.  Service was a bit slow so I was reading the receipt and read: "For your convenience, a 15% tip has been added to the total."  ROTF ;-)  Beside the technical point that it was really added to the SUBtotal, the concept boggles the mind.  And of course, this is on top of the $12/person/day mandatory tip added to our bill for the entire trip "for our convenience".  Don'tcha just love it when people are so concerned about your convenience?  OY.</div>
