<div class="content">Hi Mark and All,<br><br>Okay -- I am coming back to Autofocus.  It is a strange feeling, but I am somehow very drawn back to this system.  That must mean something...<br><br>I am sticking with my digital system and going back to using OneNote 2007 as my primary place I put my lists.  However, for hard due date tasks, I will have them in OneNote too but also create an Outlook 2007 task.  After much thought about this, I think I will be able to track my deadline-driven projects better this time.  I just have a feeling...<br><br>I have to travel the next few days on business, but when I return to my office on Friday, I will set things back up again for Autofocus.<br><br>At any rate...I am back...welcome the professor back to AF....<smiles><br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Glad to see you're back David.<br><br>Even if Autofocus still doen't work out for you, do stick around the forum as it's always interesting to read your posts. Also remember a number of others have said they took several attempts to make it work for them so you never know!<br><br>All the best<br><br>Hannah</div>

<div class="content">David,<br><br>After a very brief fllirtation with MLO, I have reverted back to my previous modus operandi which seems similar to yours: manual notebook (I missed it while trying to go too digital, seek damn perfection etc!) complemented by OneNote 2007.  <br><br>I work away from home, mainly abroad, so my contexts are pretty easy to define.  Some items, work and personal, just can't be done till I get back home, so I highlight those in yellow, stick them in OneNote, then, as you do, set up a task reminder linked to Outlook so that I needn't worry about them during my AF scanning.<br><br>I started this AF beta test at the beginning, a day before I left the UK on my current assignment in Zambia.  But my AF lists (Work and Personal, although these sometimes get entwined in each other!) are already full of items to do when I get back home on 7 February.  It will be interesting to see how AF works for me in domestic climes.</div>

<div class="content">I had been using MLO since the start of the beta, but found the Windows Mobile version laborious (to copy and paste a partially done item to the last page of my outline was taking several keystrokes).<br><br>So I'm switching to ListPro, which I haven't used for years. I'm just using it on the PDA, which I can view when at a PC on the larger screen with MyMobile (most standard PC keystrokes apply). It seems more suitable for AF. I have a folder AutoFocus with Home, Office etc files, which load instantly. Drag and drop works, and lines are numbered automatically so one knows when to start a new page/list. Dismissed tasks can be highlighted. I set up a list template called Page, and the program automatically named the ensuing lists Page, Page 2, Page 3, etc (which was a nice surprise).<br><br>Issues to do with whether to have one or multiple AF lists have been among my main concerns, and I feel these are now largely resolved with ListPro, as the speed means there is negligible overhead to pasting the same task to more than one file.<br><br>The only thing I miss from MLO - and I really miss it - is the facility to get a neat list of things done today. But the same would be true of pen and ink - which is also very tempting!<br><br>Hope this helps someone.</div>

<div class="content">Laurence,<br><br>Thanks and no thanks for your post!  I have had ListPro for a number of years, but it has fallen into occasional use, mainly for software key codes, assignment/travel checklists etc.  Now you.re tempting back into the digital approach!  The latter would be nice, should stop the odd duplication which I have in my manual system<br><br>So I recognise the ease you describe in using ListPro, especially as I have the twin desktop and mobile version, so synchronisation should be a cinch.<br><br>I'm interested to know if you use any tags.  I've developed a handful, along with two highlighters (Yellow for Defer To Do Later, Orange for Dismissed), in my manual system.  My eye has got used to scanning past the highlighted items as well as strikehtrough completed items so that my undone sins of omission stand out.<br><br>I'd like know if you use tags, contexts etc and swap notes on set-up for a trial.  Which version are you using?  Mine is 4.1, my PPC is an HTC P3600.  Please email rhj1947ATgmail.com and I'll send you my regular email address in reply.</div>
