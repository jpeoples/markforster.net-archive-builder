<div class="content">OK, I've been throught the instructions and the FAQ's and I don't understand "dismiss".  If you go through a page and can't find something to do, you "Dismiss" it.  Does that mean that I'm trhowing out the task, and it won't get done?  Or is there a procedure to review dismissed items to maybe make them active again?  <br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Zack<br><br>By the time you get to the point of dismissing an item, you will already have had several opportunities to do it so that "the system" is identifying the fact that you don't intend to do that task at the present time.  Those tasks need not be dismissed for ever.  Just add a regular task to your list to "review dismissed items".  If appropriate you can then readd any of those tasks back into AF.<br><br>Hope that helps .....</div>

<div class="content">Also, don't forget that any action you do on an item allows you to cross it off and add it to the end.  So a little research counts toward a task.</div>

<div class="content">Put a question mark at the end of the item.  If the answer is yes, add it to the end of the list and cross it off your current page (Mark details this somewhere on the discussion forum.)<br><br>Ex.  Buy new bed<br><br>It's the last item on the current page but I won't have the funds for several more months.  When ended with a question mark, the answer is yes so I process it accordingly.</div>

<div class="content">Zack:<br><br>The instructions are actually quite clear about what happens to dismissed items:<br><br>"It doesn’t mean you can never re-enter them, but you should let some time pass before you do and consider carefully why they were rejected, whether they really need to be done at all, whether the time is ripe for them to be done, whether they distract from your main goals, and any other factors. When you do re-enter a dismissed item, it is often best to break it down or re-phrase it in some way."<br><br>Well, I think it's clear anyway!</div>

<div class="content">When I decide (or are forced) to dismiss a task, I write a cross in the check box and either leave it as it is (meaning the task is dismissed forever) or write the task on a piece of paper that I put into my tickler file for a later review.</div>
