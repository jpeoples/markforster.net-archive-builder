<div class="content">On the topic of proper handling of Column 2, here's a situation I am dealing with right now.<br><br>A couple weeks ago, my manager asked me to take on a small side project, to do some spreadsheet work for someone in another part of the organization.  I always like doing spreadsheet work so I gladly agreed to take a look.<br><br>After meeting with the person who needed the spreadsheet, and agreeing to do a first draft within the next week or two, I entered the task in Column 1:  "Spreadsheet 1st draft".  <br><br>The task soon "stood out", and I started working on it.   It then got re-entered in Column 2.<br><br>A few days later, my main work went into high gear -- running a pilot on some software that our group will be using.  I'm coordinating our team's pilot work, and this task has quickly taken all my attention.   <br><br>For this main project, SF is working beautifully.<br><br>However, there's that nasty spreadsheet clogging up Column 2.  It's always the last thing left in Column 2.  I really don't have time for it right now.  In retrospect, I never should have taken on the project, knowing that our pilot work would be starting soon.  But that's in retrospect.  Right now, I've still got this rock sitting in Column 2 that I need to deal with.<br><br>I already emailed the guy who needs the spreadsheet -- he's fine if it takes a week or two longer before I deliver it.  <br><br>But the project is not done.  It just needs to be postponed for a week or two.<br><br>Now it seems the logical thing to do would be to say "done for now" and put it into an Outlook reminder for a week or so from today, and then I'd reenter into Column 1 at that point.<br><br>But I really want to follow the SF rules as strictly as possible, both in letter and in spirit.  But this puts me in a difficulty.  The project is NOT done.  I AM still committed to do the project -- I CANNOT just delete it.  But I CAN'T really give it any attention right now.  <br><br>So what I have been doing, whenever that project is keeping me from moving to the next page, is setting the timer for 5 minutes and opening the file and reading over the associated emails, just to keep the ideas in my mind to let my subconscious percolate on it.  <br><br>But I feel like my subconscious already has plenty of other work to do.  :-)   This 5 minutes seems like annoying busywork -- but that seems to be what the rules are telling me to do.<br><br>Mark, any advice on the best way to handle this, in full keeping with the intent of the SF rules?<br><br>Thanks!!<br><br><br>(Ah, finally, I can move that task forward, now that I've written this post about it!!)  :-)</div>

<div class="content">This is exactly the type of situation that David Allen remarks on all of the time -- it is one of the key strengths of GTD in that situations and priorities can change quickly.  In GTD parlance, this would mean this project would be moved to a Someday list, which is reviewed at least weekly.  When it is time for this project to become active again, it would be moved to the active projects list.  Pretty simple, really.<br><br>I too will be interested in hearing Mark's take on how to handle these situations in SF3.<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content"><<I too will be interested in hearing Mark's take on how to handle these situations in SF3.>><br><br>Count me in.<br><br>Before hearing Mark's answer to this, I must say that combining these GTD practices (Someday/Maybe list & a weekly review of it)  with SF3 seems like a very sound solution.<br>Actually, it seems like SF3 can allow us to use only some (the most useful) parts of GTD, thus forming a global organizing/processing system with greatly reduced overhead and much more efficient processing compared to full-blown GTD (and I mean processing as in "taking action" on tasks, not the GTD definition).<br>After all SF3 is only a part - albeit the main one - of Mark's global time management system anyway (he still makes use of a calendar, outlook reminders, project files...)</div>

<div class="content">I wrote the above post before being able to read Mark's one right above it.<br><br><<It's a good higher level rule (i.e. higher than the rule for any individual system) that your time management system is there to help you get your work done, not to get in your way.>><br><br><br>Mark, I guess this means that we could mentally add as an unofficial, common sense rule, the right to (occasionaly) reconsider the last remaining column 2 items and, after careful and honest reflexion, consider as "done for now", without taking any action on them, those which have shifted to low priority in our current circumstances? <br>We could then either dump them into a "pending" folder (reviewed regularly), or put a reminder in our calendar to rewrite them in C1 later, or rewrite them in C1 right away? This kind of occasional bending of the rules seems necessary to make sure that practicing SF is truely "helping us to get our work done" and not "getting in our way", but what would be the solution YOU would chose ?</div>

<div class="content">I agree.  While it is a "common sense" rule, these situations can develop frequently.  New projects come your way, and they are high priority and have a tight deadline.  Those tasks in column 2 associated with a project that now has to be put on hold...what do you do with them?  Cross them out?  I would do so and then as Daouda said, add them to a someday or pending folder and make an entry to review this folder frequently.<br><br>Mark, I think we need some set of rules here....or....is common sense enough?  :)<br><br>-David</div>

I'd invoke that if I were you. >><br><br>Well, sure, I could always do that!  :-)    But I like to learn how a new system is supposed to work, before I start superseding the rules.   And I figured there must be a way to handle a change of priorities, while staying within the rules.<br><br>Changing priorities is just a fact of life for many of us.   You've already addressed some relevant scenarios.  Example:  Your boss assigns you some work.  You are working on it in Column 2.  Your boss then de-prioritizes that work.  This changes what "done" means, so you are free to count it as "done for now", and re-enter it in Column 1, or in your reminder system.<br><br>If I see any pattern in this discussion and in your explanation of the rules as you intended them to work, it's this:<br><br>+ When the change of priorities is being imposed upon me from outside, then it's acceptable to count the task as finished, and take it out of Column 2.  The original task has changed, it's DONE, and now there's a new task to be considered.<br><br>+ When the change of priorities is MY OWN DECISION, and the task itself has not essentially changed in any way, then you appear to be strongly recommending that I DON'T take it out of Column 2.  I think your reason is that Column 2 will lose its effectiveness if I get in the habit of doing that.  I'm allowed to DELETE the task if I have really decided to quit on it -- but only if I truly have no intention of entering that task later, as a way to get around the rules. <br><br><br>Is this an accurate summary of how you intended it to work?<br><br><br>Thanks!!</div>

<div class="content"><<your time management system is there to help you get your work done, not to get in your way.>><br><br>Mark,<br><br>To my mind, you're being cryptic, and possibly a tad sarcastic. Or perhaps I'm reading this wrong. Either way, I would find it helpful if you clarified your responses to criticisms or questions to SF. <br><br>I've noticed that all time management creators assume certain environments and contexts for their systems. For example, I find the power of Mark's systems are best experienced when USING the system as often as possible, and following the rules with little hacking. <br><br>GTD seems best suited for folks with many contexts and projects. <br><br>etc, etc. <br><br>The trick - one which I still struggle with - is to find a system/rules that suit your environment, and don't clash with your values. Personally, I also find it hard to buy into systems that over-promise i.e Mind Like Water.</div>

<div class="content">Humm, I think I've got it now.<br><br>Notice Mark wrote<br><br><<I don't consider how you manage reminders to be part of the system, so it's really up to you to decide how you prefer to do it. >><br><br>I think GTD is giving us misleading assumptions about what "time management system" can mean to Mark Forster (and I suspect this annoys him a little bit).<br>It's pretty obvious that David Allen and him have a very different way of providing us "systems" to adress our time management issues. They focus on very different areas of the broad "time management" scope. <br><br>They both cover the whole spectrum, but David Allen's "system" mainly goes into much details about the "organization" part of TM : <br>GTD takes you by the hand and teaches you, step by step, a very precise, systematic and defined way of breaking up, sorting and organizing ALL of your data, projects and tasks, leaving you with a bunch of lists, along with some "best practices" advices (weekly review), some fundamental principles ("next action" model of inputting tasks) and a reminder system (tickler and calendar), but no real, efficient help on how to choose what to do and when. <br>He gives us a lot of guidance and little flexibility in the "organization" part (which he calls "collecting" & "processing") / a lot of (too much?) flexibility with no real guidance in the "choosing what to do and when" part (which I would rather call "processing") - except the awkward concept of context/available energy/available time.<br><br>MF with AF/DWM/SF pretty much takes the inverted approach to TM : his central "system" focuses on very cleverly giving us both guidance and (a sometimes too limited?) flexibility in the "choosing what to do and when" part to really help us actually Get Things Done. Everything else regarding TM surrounding the central system, including project management, data organization and management, and the reminders systems, is pretty much left up to us. <br>He does provide us with a lot of great tips, suggestions and tools covering almost all of these areas, but he gives us, purposively I think, much more freedom and flexibility in the "organization" part vs GTD. <br>We are free to choose whatever will work optimally with our personality, environment, and the varying natures of our projects. Mark actively encourages us to adopt any combination of strategies that may help us get our work done WITHOUT ever getting in our way. <br>This seems to me like the much better approach vs David Allen's one. <br><br>If the GTD system of organizing things happens to work well for someone under a certain set of circumstances, I don't see how or why it coudlnt be compatible with the SF system of tasks processing ... Just get rid of contexts (or keep only 2 : work and personal, with a SF notebook for each) and dont give as much importance to the "next action" way of inputting tasks, and you are left with a valid set of options for all the TM-related "stuff" that surrounds the central SF system. It might not be what Mark would choose for himself, but it might work for some people.<br><br>And yes, "mind like water" is ridiculous, and sounds even creepier when you put it in the MSIA - John-Roger context.<br><br>(Sorry for this long awkward rambling, english is not my first language)</div>

<div class="content">Aha, so there IS a common sense rule. Or meta rule.<br><br>As I understand it, the question here is, what should we do when circumstances force us to renegotiate an existing commitment. From Mark's previous writings, this is something which we should consider to be a major hit to our credibility and should not allow lightly. However, when we do find ourselves about to be overloaded, we should bite the bullet and limit the damage as far as possible by renegotiating.<br><br>The question then is how does this affect our list. There is a range of options, from the minimal "move back to column 1" through "dismiss", "set outlook trigger" to "rework list from scratch in the light of the new priorities". I quite like "dismiss" as it will stick out like a sore thumb.<br><br>If we are working in an unstable environment, we probably need to be especially careful to phrase most if not all of our column 2 entries as bite sized chunks. "First draft" probably seemed quite manageable when you wrote it down. Can it be divided further?</div>

<div class="content">Mark: If anyone deserves a break it's you!  Having just recovered from what sounds like a bad case of flu, you'll really benefit from it I'm sure.<br><br>I think it's all too easy, in the consumer culture we now live in, to forget that you have given us your wonderful systems as a gift.  We are not entitled to demand 24/7 'customer service' just because there are some elements we haven't yet got to grips with.  All of the Autofocus variations have gone through this process of testing and questioning and improving, and SuperFocus is no different.  <br><br>It'll do us no harm to soldier on for a couple of weeks on our own, and will maybe make us more appreciative.<br><br>Best wishes.</div>
