<div class="content">I lauch a new thread of some tips we use about AF- They concern all AF. I hope every body will participate ti share ideas and improvements. <br><br>I use AFR (it AF4R less 4). It's an hybrid system of AF and AF4R. <br>To explain imagine just a AF1 list with page separated like in AF4R...<br>Pages are treated one by one and dissmissed like on AF1.<br><br>Pages are separated like this. ASAP (OLD and NEW)/ UNFINISHED/ RECURRING TASKS/ TIKLER by quarter/ DO EVENTUALLY/ PROJECT LIST/ <br><br>The system works perfectly well. <br><br>This tips concern is adaptable to every AF and is about my 2011 objectives. I will try to do them until the end of the year. <br><br>It consist of simply grouping all relative tasks together by concerned pages. <br><br>Ex in my ASAP page  I took from AF all tasks concerning my organization and my acounts to treat them one by one. Crossed them at the to and reported at the end of the page. <br><br>example :<br>Strategy 2011<br>- Decide what to do and how for 2011<br>- <br><br>Spreadsheet (tool)<br>-Update my building list for 2011<br>- Update my client's list for 2011<br>- Update building's seller for 2011<br>- Update real estate company i want to work with for 2011<br>- Eliminate every one on my data base i don't work to work with<br><br>Account (tool)<br>- Make a spread sheet about my business previsional<br>- Update my spread sheet about expenses previsional s<br><br>This help me to focus on some kinds of projects at a very short term.</div>
