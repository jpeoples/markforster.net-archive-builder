<div class="content">I have been testing DWM since Feb the 4th -8 days now- and like it very much. I really agree with all the positive impressions posted in this forum: effective, simple, intuitive... exciting.<br>My problem is practical. In spite of DWM theoretical simplicity, the fact of handling the open list point for re-entering tasks  (1 week from today) has been confusing for me . Perhaps "confusing" is too much a word... but as you are constantly going back to this point, at the end of the day you notice it. I tried a clip as a mark but the problem is more than the physical location: It is the fact that the date has no natural meaning and you are always around it or referring to it. <br>Since Feb the 9th (Today is my 3rd day) after reading Mark's posting, I tried the following change -and it really works for me:<br><br><br>Original DW: Dismissal point:Yesterday; Re-entering Point: Today+7days; New Task: Today+1month<br><br>Reschedl. DWM: Dismissal point:Today-7days; Re-enteringP: Tomorrow; New Task: Dismissal Day+1month<br><br>This simple change gives me a natural feeling. Most of my active tasks are now located in the "real today" at the beginning of the day and I feel it natural to move them to tomorrow. Also, when acting on any other task I feel it natural to re-enter it tomorrow.  I guess this change might affect other aspects of DWM, just feel free to comment on that...<br><br><br>Pacopepe</div>

<div class="content">If I understand you reschedule correctly, the dates between "today' and "today-7" are still open? And new tasks are basically entered at today+3weeks? (if dismissal date is last week then dismissal date + 4 weeks is only 3 weeks from today)<br><br>I know for me, the fact that DWM has nothing 'open' before today's date is a HUGE plus which would get lost with the reschedule. And if I understand your new task date calculation, there's one less week to work on an item before dismiss-date.</div>

<div class="content">pacopepe:<br><br>Looks like you have simply moved everything back one week in time.  <br><br>Surely this undermines one of the main characteristics which is that everything is ahead and can be done in good time rather than being 'past due' and being more like a backlog.  This is a vital difference for me.<br><br>My experience so far is that all my tasks are getting done well ahead of the threat of dismissal and its coped with a couple of more urgent items without stress on my part.<br><br>It seems entirely natural & logical to me that anything still on the page with yesterdays date is automatically dismissed.  I'm finding that the two entry points are working extremely well, complementing one another.  <br><br>Having tasks entered across a range of dated pages doesn't bother me at all, I only think about the printed date at the beginning of each day when yesterdays dated page becomes dead and I move my 1 week and 1 month markers forward one day.  Other than that the date is irrelevant.<br><br>For me this method is the most productive and satisfying I've ever experienced.</div>

<div class="content">The date thing was an obstacle for me for the first ... 5 days or so?  But now I pretty much ignore the dates that I've written at the top of the pages (I just converted my old AF book for the switch to DWM).  It took me a BIT longer to get used to the fact that re-entry often involves moving "backwards" in the book (as I re-enter tasks that fall between page 7 and page 30) but even now, on day 11, that's getting to be second nature.<br><br>It seems like the biggest hurdle with DWM has been getting past the date on the pages not meaning "this is today" but rather "this is your deadline for acting on these tasks".</div>
