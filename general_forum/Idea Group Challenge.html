<div class="content">We each earn points, and the rewards are based on the team totals.<br><br>More ideas welcome. These are just to get the ball rolling.<br><br>Technology:<br><br>Something on FreeForums.net? Section for each team, and general section for teams to report in.<br><br>Wonder if anyone else has done something similar? Reinvent the wheel?<br><br>Points earned:<br><br>Based on individual goals for the day? Week? Month?<br><br>Limited number of points per day so have to plan more realistically.<br>or<br>Assign points as you like, then report % points earned. (faster planning)<br><br>Penalty for fire-fighting? Way to distinguish honest fires from "loudest" or "most attractive"?<br><br>Stretch goals get bonus points if main goals met. Working on stretch goals instead of main goals is not good.<br><br>Help us set more realistic goals, since not meeting them will hurt the team. Bonus points for meeting stretch goals.<br><br>Rewards:<br><br>Bragging rights? Where?<br><br>Other?</div>
