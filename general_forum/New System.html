<div class="content">For those who are still in the experimenting stages, I put up a new system I am starting to experiment with using a page a day diary.  It attempts to handle new work, while working off a closed backlog list and also attempt to work in some goals as well.  Let me know if anyone has comments.<br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div>

<div class="content">Gerry-looks fairly comprehensive and the goal portion is a nice addition.  Will have time in a few days to consider whether I will try and implement it.</div>

<div class="content">How do you decide where to put new tasks when they come in during the day, Gerry? You mention a 'future date' but don't say how the decision is made.</div>

<div class="content">Linda,<br><br>I did not put a hard and fast rule as I am going to try to trust my instinct to know if I can add it today and get it done, or schedule it out in the future if I can't.  If a task comes up once you are working during the day, there will be an element of art versus science to the system.  The idea is to keep current and have a backlog which only shrinks. <br><br>Thanks<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">Hi Gerry, <br><br>Interesting ideas...<br><br>I am struggling to work at any system consistently at the moment! I would say that is my main problem. I'm trying the following configuration (which varies almost daily!) - <br><br>1. My Goal (mine at the moment is to complete a 10K run on 11th July)<br>2. Problem Scenario (this probably resembles a backlog of stuff that needs to get done at some point but has no hard deadline - my current on is to sell a pushchair we have in storage.)<br>3. Closed List (the items screened here are from my notebook, email, voicemail and paper - basically as in DIT). <br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>My closed list goes here - the aim is to keep it as short as possible and to minimise my interruptions<br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>Daily notes for information, reminders etc. go here, under the line.<br><br>So this method, if I can stick to it, basically gives me 3 things per day to concentrate on. Which is enough for me, as I do not really have much discretionary time, especially at home. <br><br>It's basically a combination of ideas from Mark Forster, Leo Babauta and Gerry.<br><br>Any thoughts / improvements from others?</div>

<div class="content">Oh, I forgot:<br><br>My Goal: An approx time frame for this would be 3 - 6 months. Having one main goal helps me maintain the focus needed to achieve it. <br><br>Problem Scenario: I've got a list of projects (without any deadline) to do, one at a time, in highest value order. This is basically the same as Mark's Organizational Project ideas.<br><br>Gerry, I really like the idea of running with a system for, say, 90 days - maybe that's what I should do! No more tinkering!</div>

<div class="content">Leon,<br><br>Your items are a sort of mix of various items and systems. It looks like you really have a list of two or  three projects.  I am not sure the difference between 2 and 3.  If you were to use the new system, you would take everything and put it on either the backlog list, the goal list or into the diary at a future date.  The 10K run would be put on a goal list and then you would put on today's page go for a 3 mile run or whatever you needed to do to get ready for the race.  Selling the chair is actually on the goal list, as it does not have to be done, unless it does to have to be done, ie to pay for a necessity. You would also plan your day making sure you get today's work done and if time permits, then items from the backlog.  <br><br>I actually think this system would be very helpful in your instance, but you would have to stick to it and forsake all others to give it a shot at working.  I think it is actually a bit more focused than the other systems I have written and is good for getting lots of tasks done and reducing backlogs.<br><br>Good luck</div>

<div class="content">Where do you put items you'd like to do in future, but don't need to be done on a specific date?<br><br>If these are put in on an arbitrary date, do the instructions permit them to be done ahead of time?</div>

<div class="content">Leon, yes, the posts seemed to cross. <br><br>Lean & Smileypete<br><br>I tried to stay away from the idea of deadlines and focus on must be done or would like to do.  If it has to be done, the deadline will be known.  If it never has to be done, but you would like to do it, you 1. keep current with your work, 2. reduce the backlog and then 3. work the goals into your life.  So things that you would like to do but don't have to be done, by definition do not have a date, so as long as you are current on your work and the backlog is reducing, you work these items in as time permits and as you feel. <br><br>Thanks for reviewing the new system.<br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div>

<div class="content">Gerry, <br><br>Thanks for your comments. <br><br>Did you consider using your 'Do It' method and use one list to record both potential goals and backlog of items? As it seems to me (at least in my case) that most of my backlog items are not neccesarily 'must do' items. If they 'must do' they are likely to get done, rather than becoming a backlog of things, aren't they?</div>

<div class="content">Leon,<br><br>I have generally used Do It for much longer term goals once I have decided positively to do them.  The idea of the new system is for things to be tracked and worked on based on time and intuition.  This is more akin to a someday/maybe list in GTD versus an absolute must do life changing goal which is what Do It is about.  <br><br>Personally I separate work from personal, so I am working on my Do It stuff at defined times of the day like lunch and after work or on the weekends, so there is a separation.  This was something I wrote about in one of the ebooks maybe the first one.  But, for me it works better to use one of the time management systems for work and Do It for the personal big goals.  On these, I don't really need time management, I need the focus of the Do It system to identify them and stay on track over a longer period of time until they are accomplished.<br><br>I hope this helps<br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div>

<div class="content">Hi Gerry, <br><br>I've now had chance to have a closer look at your new system, I have some feedback / queries:-<br><br>Overall I feel it is very clearly written and well thought out. <br><br>The Goal List: You state that 'This list can grow as you will add new goals to it. You do not want to limit your list of future possibilities'. <br><br>You later go on to note, under different methods for Review,  <br><br>'If the Goal List is reducing, your quality of life is increasing. If the goal list is growing or items are being put into the system (checked off) but not completed (crossed off), this indicates these items are not getting done. <br><br>My concerns here are: <br><br>1. Potential loss of focus: I believe it would be very difficult to maintain a useful level of focus by effectively working from an open goals list that seems to share similarities with the GTD Someday / Maybe concept. For example, if one has a one page list of 30 items on it, if feel this would spread my level of focus too thinly.<br><br>2. I think it's likely that the Goal List is just going to continue growing, In much the same way that a Someday / Maybe list does. So, I do not feel the method of Review you describe above would work. I.e. I am working on some my goals, yet my goal list is growing - so by your definition my quality of life is not improving.<br><br>With the different types of Reviews you mention: Items above & below the line. I agree this would be valuable to do on a daily basis.<br><br>Backlog List Review: I feel it would be valuable to review this list weekly or monthly. <br><br>Life Improvement Review: I feel it would be valuable to review this list weekly or monthly. Although, as stated, I am not sure at this stage of the validity of this review measure.  <br><br>Gerry, I hope you do not feel I am being negative, as I like your work. I hope you find my feedback valuable and would appreciate your thoughts as well as the thoughts of other readers on the Forum.</div>

<div class="content">Leon,<br><br>No worries about negativity, I appreciate the feedback.  I think how you treat the goals list can be a personal decision.  I personally am not bothered by an open list as I like to capture ideas and don't want to forget things, but agree that it can be a distraction and in fact as you know in Do It use a very short closed list of three Desired Outcomes to have a very focused system.  I think it is a very good alternative to close the goals list like the backlog list if someone chooses.  In fact if it is closed, it is easier to review to see if it is shrinking and you are seeing goal achievement.  I also think the review of the lists on a time table that suits someone is no problem for a higher level review as well, with the caveat that if you have time in your day you should be looking to those lists to get more items completed.<br><br>It is great feedback and I hope it provides a system that is useful for some.  My systems have come from specific issues I have dealt with at work and personally as I try to get more efficient and achieve personal goals.  I find it helpful to try to develop new systems and for me it helps to try to write them out and see if they can be expressed clearly so other can use them.  Thanks for the feedback<br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div>

<div class="content">At what point would you create a new backlog? For example, if you fell 3 days behind etc?</div>

<div class="meta">2010-05-19 23:30</div>
<div class="content">The goal is never to have another backlog.  The backlog list is a closed list.  You are supposed to put the new work into the system in a manner that leaves enough time to get it done with some "bandwidth" for the backlog list and goals list to get get placed into the system and reduced.  If you can not keep up, like Mark suggests, you have too many commitments and no time management system can really fix that over the long term.<br><br>Good luck<br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div>
