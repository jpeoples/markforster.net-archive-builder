<div class="content">I would like to revisit something that has been discussed before and that is coming to tasks on your list that you cannot do as you are in the wrong context.  One of the powerful methods in GTD is the use of context lists.  So, if I am at home, and I start working through my backlog component of my AF4 list, and I encounter tasks that I cannot do because I need the computer in my office to do them, then what does one do?  Some have said that one should just ignore these tasks because I cannot do them and move on.  I think Mark has said that if you find only tasks in the backlog section that cannot be done due to you needing to be somewhere else or needing some other tool, then mark these for dismissal and then you can rewrite them again in the active tasks portion of the AF4 list.<br><br>But this seems somewhat strange to me to dismiss things simply because I am not in the appropriate context.  I could see me doing this every evening while working at home.  I never had this problem with GTD because....well....I had context lists.<br><br>What are the thoughts of others on this?  Mark, am I reporting correctly on your advice on this?<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">David:<br><br>My advice to those who work in different places has always been to have a separate list for each location.<br><br>My advice has also always been that you shouldn't ignore the rules about dismissing, just because you can't do a task at a particular time.<br><br>Both these apply to all versions of AF.</div>

<div class="content">Mark, this is work that I bring home with me -- my position is a 24/7 one and therefore I am doing a lot of work at home in the evenings and nights.  One context I used to have in GTD was @Briefcase, which meant work that I could take with me.  That on top of @Online was work I could do from home in the evenings.  I guess I could just do the work in my briefcase and completely ignore my AF4 lists away from my office.  The same I guess when I travel to conferences and the frequent visits to my field team.  But it seems wrong to ignore the AF4 list when away from my office.  Something still does not feel right here to me....<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">David:<br><br>Again my recommendation has always been that if you take work home with you you add it to your Home list. There's no reason why something shouldn't be on both lists. Similarly if there's something personal you can only do from your workplace during the day (phone the bank, buy birthday present, etc), then you add it to your Office list.<br><br>I also recommend having a shorter list for when you travel.</div>

<div class="content">@DAVID one idea about context. I have externalised some of them. Ex Errands goes on my iphone so when i think on the rush about something to buy i put it on AF4 but when i read it i cross it and report it on my iphone. Then when i am out i have my iphone list. <br><br>I do the same with someday may be list wich goes at a special page of my AF list, idem with my tickler items wich goes either on my calendar and either on my AF4 note book at a special page.<br><br> I have no trouble about context for i work at home so AF4 works perfectly. I dont need 2 lists (home and work). <br><br>As my AF4 NEVER LEAVE my office when i travel or go away for a long time i copy my pages and bring it with me. So i am sure not to loose it...</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>Really?  Add my work tasks to my home list?  SO when I get home, I would look at the work I have brought home in my briefcase and add this to my home list at the bottom of my active list?  And then I start working my home list in the backlog according to the AF4 rules, it could take me a bit to get to the work I need to do (I have some important work on my home list too that has nothing to do with my office work), which is on my active list.  Or should I just go straight to it?  I guess I am still confused and not sure that it is a good idea to mix my professional work with my list of personal work at home.<br><br>Thanks, Jupiter, for your suggestions too.<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">David:<br><br>We've discussed this point before too, and my answer was then and still is that if you need to do something now then do it now. In AF4 terms that would mean moving directly to the work you need to do, and then carrying on from  there.<br><br>Remember AF is intended to help you do your work, not get in the way of doing it!</div>

<div class="content">Okay, fair enough, Mark.  However, I still am not comfortable with mixing my work tasks with my home list, so I am going to explore another way to do this.  One simple way would be to make a list before leaving work of the tasks I wish to accomplish at home and work off of that.<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">What do you think, Mark?  Is my separate list a good idea?  This is along the lines of what you have said before about taking a separate list with you on trips and not the parent AF notebook.<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="meta">2009-11-30 18:58</div>
<div class="content">David:<br><br>This rather depends on how you want to act when you're at home. Do you want to do your work tasks all together at a specific time? In which case your idea of the separate list will probably work well.<br><br>Personally I don't make a distinction between tasks on the basis of their source. They're all tasks to me. As long as I do them within an appropriate amount of time, what's it matter where they came from? Anyway is answering this comment "work" or "play"? - since I'm not intending (as yet) to make any money out of AF4 it's difficult to draw the distinction. You may have the same difficulty: it's easy enough to say that the grant committee application is "work", but what about your report as Chairman of the University Golf Club (just an example!)??</div>

<div class="content">Good point -- I see what you are saying.  If I do not plan to work solely on the work tasks within a specified time period, then indeed it might be better to add them to the home list.  Am I reading you correctly on this?<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="meta">2009-11-30 19:06</div>
<div class="content">David:<br><br>I think so. If you are going to do a mix of "work" and "personal" items, then it seems to make sense to work off one list. <br><br>But the important thing is to find what works for you and stick to it.</div>

<div class="content">I do a lot of work-related tasks at home, and a lot of personal tasks at work. Therefore, I just keep one AF4 notebook, not two. But I also have separate personal and company email accounts, and separate physical In trays. So, on my single list, I append "@W" or "@H" to tasks where I might get confused; e.g., "Empty In tray @W." I don't think there's anything wrong with waiting to follow the dismissal rule of AF4, if you feel you haven't had enough turns at the closed list in both contexts. For example, if it's the weekend and you have quite a few at-work-only tasks, you might want to wait until Monday afternoon to put the remaining ones on notice. But in general I agree with Mark that it's better to just follow the rules and keep moving; having to consider whether to rewrite a task during frequent Reviews is good, in that it makes you ask yourself why it hasn't gotten done yet, and whether you really intend to do it at all!</div>

<div class="content">David: "One simple way would be to make a list before leaving work of the tasks I wish to accomplish at home and work off of that."<br><br>I do that occasionally and it works for me. Otherwise I never do anything when I get home. This way, at work, I just assign a couple of things depending on how tired I am, etc.</div>

<div class="content">After reading this thread, I decided to split my list between "work" and "home".<br><br>With AF4, I tried to keep everything in one place. Now I notice how it stressed me to read what I have to do at home while I'm browsing my work stuff.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-12-1 17:38</div>
<div class="content">Finally I did the same and split home and work tasks in 2 different list . Why ? because I noticed that some time i like to work on my professional work and others i like to work on my personal work (I often work on my personal work after 8:30 PM) <br>I also like he idea of doing things without reporting them on AF4 when something just need to be done. It's one of the great ideas I regularly apply even if it is not so easy.</div>

<div class="content">Ubi:<br><br><< I don't think there's anything wrong with waiting to follow the dismissal rule of AF4, if you feel you haven't had enough turns at the closed list in both contexts. >><br><br>I'm not suggesting that you should change a method if it works for you, but I want to point out an additional effect of not dismissing items in AF4. That is that if you leave some items undismissed because it's the weekend, then you are presumably not closing the open list. The effect of this is that for a couple of days you are effectively working with only an open list, and are therefore entirely losing the Autofocus effect for the period in question.</div>

<div class="content">@Mark:<br><br><<That is that if you leave some items undismissed because it's the weekend, then you are presumably not closing the open list.>><br><br>Does this mean, that if e.g. 15 office related items are on the closed section of the list and I can't do them on friday, saturday, sunday I'm going to dismiss them (if I don't do anything on the closed section at all) and then close the open section. In the next turn I readd all 15 items to the new open section - depending on the amount of items which are waiting for the right context this could  be an annoying rewriting of stuff...</div>

<div class="content">@Mark<br><br>Let's recapitulate dissmissing. If I well understand Mark's method, if no items stands at you then they are dissmiss. What does that mean ? <br><br>For me it means than on a CLOSE LIST some items seems never to be done. They can be activable in the future but not now, they can be non activable (waiting for) they can be un usefull. It just means that you can't or don't want to acte on them.Then when  you read these items and you HIGHLINE them.  This HIGHLINE means that you can not do anything with them. They are non activable at all. They just dont stand and you. You are stuck with this items. So you will have to decide what to do with them. <br><br>THEN when after a while you will read them again you will decide what to do with them : <br>ie Cross them (eliminate) reformulate and put them on the active list, put them on your diary (future task) or even on your tickler if you have one. For me it's exactly a #GTD PROCESS. Nothing more. <br><br>At last,  when all items are crossed or dissmiss (Highlined) you can go to to your active list and act on its items and you will do the same UNTILL nothing stand at you and THEN the active LIST becomes A NEW CLOSE LIST. And you will cross your line ie you will make a new ACTIVE LIST. <br><br>For me the question of time is not important. You highline an items or some items one by one or by group if your are scotched  (blocqued) with them. It can be after 1 hour, 1 day, 2, 3 never mind. If i am blocked i am blocked that all. And then I dissmiss. <br><br>Praticaly to acte on my dissmiss items i like reading them after 1 day. Often every morning and decide what to do with them. <br><br>my spirit during the night classified what happens the day before and i have the energy to decide to quit  or act on my dissmissed items in the way i explained before. <br><br>I hop i understood the way of dissmiss for i must confess that it tooks me a long time to really understand it and acte in the write way. <br><br>Please Mark if i made a mistake don(t hesitate to correct me. <br><br>For me dissmissing items is the most important rule of AF after the double reading.<br><br>AF4 is indeed powerfull and efficient if you strickly apply the dissmiss rules. IF you dont it becomes a terrible mess and it loose all it's efficiency.</div>

<div class="content">Reading this post I just wish to add 2 or 3 things<br>1. GTD is GTD and AF is AF so stick to one method you can have separate list home and work but stick on one method. My personal task are now begins at the end of the page. My professional at the top <br>2. Rull Dissmiss is one of the most important Rule of AF it is crucial. <br>3. The simpliest is your system the best it is. AF is just a suport. A help. I realised after 3  years doing GTD that i was slave to the system but not at all with AF and it make me creative and efficient i love it.  If I could me Mark Forster i would invite him for a lunch or a diner in Paris just to thank him. For me AF is a revolution i never stick with any other method DIT, DWM an so on.... I stick with AF 1 and AF 4 and i use both but most of the time AF4</div>
