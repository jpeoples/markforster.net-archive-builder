<div class="content">Hi, guys,<br><br>I've been using OmniFocus for DWM and quite liking it. I'm trying an experiment that I thought I'd mention here in case it might help someone--and to get feedback.<br><br>I have found that the long list of tasks can seem overwhelming (I have been working from the OF list grouped and sorted by due date, in the CONTEXT view--even though I haven't really been using contexts, this just sorts them the right way).<br><br>Now I'm trying just working from PROJECT view (also called PLANNING view). Instead of giving each task a due date, I am only giving a due date to each PROJECT, and still sorting by due date.<br><br>OF lets you expand and collapse your projects, outline style, so you can choose to see just the overarching project names, and not get bogged down in a big list of intermingled tasks.<br><br>So far, this is working great for me and really helping me keep an eye on the big picture. I'd love to hear what others think about it, or how else you're operating in OF.</div>
