<div class="content">One week with the new AF and I haven't found the need (intuitive yearning) to return to forward mode i.e. AF1. So I've dropped the reminder from my list. A nice side benefit is that I no longer need to maintain "pages", but rather one long list. And this works very well with Google Tasks, or in my case, Taskpaper. <br><br>Anyone else prefer AF1 or AF2 to the combined system?</div>

<div class="content">I put "try AF2" on my list and dismissed it.<br><br>I like the simplicity of AF1. Go through your book page by page; if you skip a page, dismiss all remaining tasks. That's it. Simple.</div>

<div class="content">Avrum,<br><br>My work goes through many phases. This summer has been hectic. So I am mostly in reverse mode. I use the forward mode as a cheat to enable me to do my on-notice item(s). Other than that, I am in reverse mode almost all the time. <br><br>I can envision a period when things will change and I will spend more time in forward mode.</div>
