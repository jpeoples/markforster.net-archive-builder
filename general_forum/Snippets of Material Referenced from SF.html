Then, whenever needed, create a folder (or a "document wallet" or any such thing) with a label matching this SF page. All those one-off scraps of paper, jotted index cards, tiny receipts, a booklet received in the mail, etc.—the stuff for which you can't bring yourself to make an entire "project folder" and which you would never want to store alphabetically—they go in this bin. If you're on this page, you're on this bin. >>><br><br>( <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1434887#post1435318" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1434887#post1435318</a> )<br><br>Intriguing idea.   I may try it sometime (see SF page 3/16/11).  :-)<br><br>I have a small handful of places where I keep those snippets of additional material:<br><br>(1) In the back of my SF notebook.  I mark the task with *B if this is the case.<br><br>(2) In my "project pile" on my bookshelf at home -- 20 or 30 misc files and scraps and such, nearly each of which is stored in a transparent folder ( <a href="http://www.officedepot.com/a/products/741341/Office-Depot-Brand-Poly-Project-Files/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.officedepot.com/a/products/741341/Office-Depot-Brand-Poly-Project-Files/</a> ).  Related scraps go into one folder.  I mark the task with *P in this case.<br><br>(3) In email.  I started using NEO for email recently (thanks Mark!!), which has super-fast search capability.  So I append "NEO: keyword1 keyword 2 keyword3" to the task.   I also tag the email with a "to do" flag so it's easier to find.<br><br>(4) In the file cabinet. *F and the name of the file. <br><br>(5) In my project files in OneNote.   Usually I can already tell pretty easily which project the task belongs to.  If it might be unclear, then I'll write the project name in parentheses.  E.g., "Review docs (xxx project)"<br><br><br>That's about it.  Works great.<br><br><br>What do others do for things like this?</div>

<div class="content">I like the transparent folders! The back-of-the-SF-notebook storage also sounds nice, but my cheap-o notebooks don't have a pocket. Generally, writing standard labels like "*F" is a great idea to link these things together. I will be experimenting with my standard set of labels. Thanks!</div>

<div class="content">If you cut an old sheet of card stock the right size, and apply some scotch tape or packing tape, it's pretty easy to make a back-of-the-notebook pocket, if your notebook is deficient in that respect.   Works great with the cheap 50-cent thread-bound school notebooks from Walmart.   :-)</div>
