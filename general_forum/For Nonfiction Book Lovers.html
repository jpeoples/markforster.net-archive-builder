<div class="content">Jacqueline turned me on to Blinkist and I love it! You can read 10-20 minute synopses of nonfiction books--many of which are productivity oriented. There's a free version and a paid version that allows you to save notes to Evernote and listen to selected "blinks" as audiobooks. Here is a link that will give you two weeks to try it for free. <a href="http://blinkist.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ea5f436a185cc8a68afc85497&id=e7b639f678&e=02246e43ef" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://blinkist.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ea5f436a185cc8a68afc85497&id=e7b639f678&e=02246e43ef</a><br><br>Let me know what you think!</div>

<div class="content">I think it's generally good netiquette to disclose if you're posting an affiliate link. <br><br>Here's the direct link:<br><a href="http://www.blinkist.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.blinkist.com</a></div>

<div class="content">Frank, I agree. That link provides people with two weeks free (instead of just a few days). I'm not an affiliate.</div>

<div class="content">I just double checked the email to make sure it's not an affiliate link. Here's the email:<br><br>We created Blinkist because we love to read, and it looks like you do, too. To say thank you for becoming a member of our community, here’s a little gift for readers you know: Give your friends 2 weeks of Blinkist, free.<br><br>To treat your friends with 2 weeks’ unlimited access to Blinkist, just share your voucher link through a network of your choice or forward it directly.</div>

<div class="content">Melanie - THANK YOU!! This link still works for anyone interested :) I tried it for 3 days, but that just wasn't enough time. Having the 14 days will defiantly give me more time to evaluate :)</div>
