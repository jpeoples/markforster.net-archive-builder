<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-04-5 17:41</div>
<div class="content">At the risk of sounding very odd, I am admitting here that I have a food hoarding problem.  I literally have enough food in my pantries and freezers that I wouldn't have to go grocery shopping for 6 months or more.   Really, how many pounds of risotto does one non-Italian family need?<br><br>My plan is to treat each shelf in the pantry, the cupboards and the freezer as a separate "page".   There's probably about 25 items or so on each shelf, so the logistics work too.  It's also somewhat disorganized, so there's a good variety on each shelf as well.  If I dismiss, I will give everything on the shelf to the food bank or the dog or the garbage eats it.  <br><br>It makes me wonder how many other things you could clear out using AF principles - too many clothes?  DVD's to watch?  <br><br>Books? - obviously.  I'm using the method to pick my next book to read based on thinking of the shelves as a page in my "to be read" bookcase.   If I don't pick one of the books, I decided that I would dismiss all of them on that shelf (ie. give them away) - I have to admit, I haven't dismissed any yet. :-)<br></div>

<div class="content">Sounds a great plan Jacqueline - keep us posted!<br><br>I tried adding some items to sort into my lists but ended up dismissing them.  What has struck me though is that I dismissed the "task" to sort them, not the items themselves ...... I think I may need to rethink my sorting project ..... :-)</div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline,<br><br>it doesn't solve your immediate food backlog problem, and doesn't really work for non-perishable items like books, CD's and DVD's but the system we have for food, largely developed by my wife, is that new long lasting food items eg rice, tins etc, are only bought when we use one item up. So, if we finish a box of tea, we add tea to the next shopping list. For any given category, there is a certain number in the cupboard, so that when you actually do finish a box, you are not in the position that you have run out of it (except when I forget to add it to the list). Once you get this system into equilibrium, it works remarkably well.</div>

<div class="content">Jaraslov, I can see that I will have a very small grocery list for quite some time, even following that style.  :-)<br><br>I do know of some people that, when they buy a new shirt for example, one of their others has to go.  This seems like a good idea to me.  <br><br>My problem is that I find sales impossible to resist.  :-)</div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline,<br><br>My neighbor has this "problem" as well.  We often shop together ... I have  CostCo membership and she has a Sam's Club membership.  She can't buy one of anything.  I have noticed that there are at least two processes at work.  1) She has a scarcity mentality ... IOW, she is in dread of not having enough ... well, food, but really anything.  So she is driven to buy multiples.  And logic does not help, she happily throws food out to make room for more food.  Logically speaking, it boggles the mind.  She has three freezers filled with food then buys more frozen food and struggles to find a place to put it.  And this goes far beyond food.  When she used to rent videos, she would rent about eight of them ... then watching them all over the week became less fun than a chore.<br><br>2) The real sustaining problem is that much of this is now automated.  I can see that she no longer thinks but reflexively grabs two of everything.  No thinking is involved.  The other day she was buying paper cups.  They came in packs of 600 (this is a warehouse store, of course ;-) and she bought two of those packs.  I asked how many a day she used and when she said "one", I walked her through the math which took her to just shy of four years worth of paper cups to be stored ... somewhere.  Which is what really drives her husband nuts ;-)<br><br>If one assumes that those are the only two factors operating, it becomes clear that a change has to take place in two places: 1) On each reach for an item ask why you are buying it and will you really run out if you don't buy lots of it and what is the worst that would happen if you did run out and, 2) stop to think in the first place ... IOW, don't shop on autopilot.<br><br>All of that said, I really like your application of AF to the shelves.  It will make for a good variety as you eat down the pantry.  As to sales, who can really resist a sale?  LOL ;-)  I learned a good lesson when Ramen noodles were on sale and I overbought.  Until then I did not know that there are bug eggs in all grain and in time they will hatch out.  OY!  Now I only overbuy sale items that are canned ... and then I make it a priority to eat them down.</div>

<div class="content">You are totally right Mike, I saw this kind of behaviour in my grandmother who grew up very poor (the 12 kids in a 2 room house kind of poor) and through the Great Depression.  We'd have to clean her freezer out every year and throw out tons of stuff because it had freezer burn.  She would literally sit down and cry on those days.  She had a bottle of pop in her fridge for 18 YEARS!!!  And she'd only give us icecream after it had turned all gummy.  <br><br>To be honest, I'm going to try to not shop at all.  I can send my oldest son out for fresh fruit, vegetables and milk - he's a minimalist.  :-)<br><br>The whole issue arose because I had on my AF list "defrost downstairs freezer", then dismissed it because I realized I would have to take everything out to defrost it, and I didn't have enough cooler space to put everything.  It's only 5 c.f., so at least it's not a huge thing, but it annoyed me that I couldn't do something that really needed doing.  I also had "organize pantry shelves" on my list, and that annoyed me because I feel that this should be something that can get done in 1/2 hour, but for me would take more like 4 or 5 hours.  Plus I want to have a completely clean pantry by the time I'm off next January.<br><br>When I lived in TX, I never had an issue, that humid climate destroys any kind of food in open boxes.<br><br>So last night for dinner we had spaghetti sauce made with broken up lasagne - having 4 boxes of lasagne noodles (well, only 3 now) and no spaghetti noodles.  My youngest son wasn't thrilled, but had to admit in the end that it tasted the same.  :-)<br></div>

<div class="content">Grocery cost this week for 3 people and 2 animals was only $12.22.  :-)  <br></div>

<div class="content">Clearly there is a common theme here whichever side of the Pond we live ;-) I spent yesterday going back (a shelf at a time at regular intervals doing other things between) working through and listing the contents of my freezers/fridges and pantry shelves.<br><br>I don't have quite the same issue as you Jacqueline, but do have a CostCo card Mike (LOL that post made me smile) and also have become lazy about what I really have in the house and making an accurate grocery list.<br><br>Well, we made some interesting findings in the contents of the freezers some of which had to be ditched but we now have lists of all the contents and a replace not add to policy for grocery shopping, a ban on CostCo until the size of the list warrants a visit and we are having fun having a choose the dinner combo nights on fridays and saturdays (my daughters is loving that,not so sure we always will!) and I have menu planned for the rest of the week, and so reduced the stress in deciding what to cook on a daily basis. <br><br>In two days I have crossed six items off my AF list and as a consequence reduced ongoing stress, saved money and have some fun pot luck nights to come! I have wanted to do all these things for so long, but this weekend they just "stood out"...so the moral...trust the system with the discretionary items!<br><br>- Titch</div>

<div class="content">I have to say that I am now motivated to rephrase "defrost freezer" as "catalogue and empty freezer"! :-)</div>

<div class="content">Christine, that is EXACTLY what I did! I read an article on reducing grocery expenditure in these challenging financial times, and this "take stock, list and work through using contents" approach was outlined in it. So I rephrased defrost freezer to that basis et voila!!<br><br>Good luck :-)</div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline,<br><br>We could really start a whole exchange about the depression mentality.  My parents struggled through the war years and theirs through the depression.  It formed their outlook on the world, to be sure.  I remember most of our meals growing up.  The menu never varied.  There were specific meals for each day of the week and I'm sure some of that was so that leftovers from one day could be used the next.  Monday and Thursday, for example were pasta days.  Saturday was hot dogs and beans.  One day was Spanish rice (oh, how I hated that).  And not finishing everything on your plate was simply not an option.  I remember some nights I'd sit there for hours, it seemed, not being able to leave because I had not finished.  And that in turn probably formed the basis of the poor eating habits and weight control problems some of us have today!<br><br>Thinking back on those meals they were all very cheap.  Grilled cheese sandwiches with tomato soup, for example.  And the tomato soup was usually stretched by crushing Saltine Crackers into it.  LOL ;-)  We ate out only very seldom and then it was usually when traveling and then at a Ho-Jo's ... which I guess was on the order of Denney's those days.  Strange how I think back fondly of my meals at Ho-Jo's.  I'll bet they were really pretty awful ;-)<br><br>Crying:  Yes, and how very sad.  She really had no choice but to buy that food and you had no choice but to throw it out.  We can wind up being slaves of our upbringing if we don't act to fix that.<br><br>Congrats on your weekly grocery bill!  YAY! ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Titch,<br><br>Do you remember some years ago when CostCo was PriceClub and often referred to as the $200 Club because that is how much you always wound up spending no matter if you only went in for some milk?  LOL ;-)  Nothing has changed.  I'm not sure how much money I really save on CostCo.  The problem is that while many things are cheaper, the quantities are so large that the overall bill is higher.  I mean, I'd normally buy a pound of hamburger but can't buy less than five pounds at CostCo.  So you have to be dedicated to using hamburger for a while if you buy it there.  But that said, it can be managed.<br><br>There is an interesting conflict that I have observed.  I can buy corn, for example, in a huge can or a six (or eight?) pack of small cans.  I started buying the small cans because while more expensive it was more convenient ... with nothing to store after it was opened.  Then I realized that I DID buy all of this plastic ware storage stuff and so why not save money on the big can, use my plastic ware, and save money?  Kind of a circular problem ;-)<br><br>I finally did resolve NEVER to buy fruit or vegetables there again ... I always wound up finding some bad in the packs that I could not see before I bought ... and I could never use it all.  So when I went to Giant I got just what I needed but OUCH! ... the PRICES!  I don't know how people manage to shop at those retail stores.<br><br>Times being what they are we are not eating in much more, shopping CostCo for the items we can use in bulk, and shopping Giant for fresh and loss leaders.  I made a killing at Giant a few weeks ago when they had Progresso soup for $1/can ... about half price and it is good soup.  At checkout the lady honestly ... with no trace of sarcasm in her voice AT ALL, asked me what church I was buying for!  LOL ;-)  But suffice it to say that while I have cans of soup in the living room, I won't be spending a lot for meals for a long while ;-)<br><br>But another note on CostCo ... I think they are bad in their food handling practices.  I love broiled salmon but one day I bought it there and the cat would not touch the bit I gave her.  When the cat will not touch the salmon, you know it is bad!  I also gave up on buying eggs there because you can't inspect them and one or more is always broken.  I don't buy milk in the summer as I suspect it stands on the loading dock too long.  Would that we lived in a world were people did their jobs correctly.  ;-(</div>

<div class="content">Strange, but on Friday I found in my pantry an Easter egg decorating kit that I bought last year when they went on sale after the holiday.  Fortunately, those things don't go bad.  :-)<br><br>Just a suggestion, but if you do end up buying large packages of ground beef, etc., I would check out "once a month cooking", just google the phrase, there's lots of resources out there.  This is a huge time-saver for me.  Between that and my crock pot, I rarely "cook" unless I'm in the mood - which always happens on Sunday afternoons.  But by doing this even on a lesser scale, I can throw supper in the oven, go walk the dog and it's ready by the time I come home.<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content"><a href="http://www.30daygourmet.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.30daygourmet.com/</a><br><br>The link above is a good monthly newsletter on OAMC and you can search the recipes online although other recipe sites like recipezaar are jumping on the OAMC bandwagon.<br><br>I would say that OAMC saves me at least an hour a day, we eat healthier and probably saves $200/month because the temptation isn't there to go to a drive through because you don't feel like the effort of cooking dinner, and there's lots of good ideas for breakfasts and lunches too.<br></div>

<div class="content">Interesting that I put all of my shelves on the list at first, went through them all in a week, and this last week I tried to follow the same system only off list - and found myself falling off the wagon.<br><br>The other side effect of it was that every night when I was preparing dinner or breakfast, knowing I had to pick one item off the list from one of the shelves got me going on the list in the morning and evening better than any other method I've tried.  So I'm going to start putting them back on.</div>
