<div class="content">Fascinating discussion by Stephan Molyneux and Dr. Jordan Peterson, professor of Psychology, about this "Self-Authoring Program" which according to the discussion was proven (psychology research) to be extremely effective in improving people's outcomes in school.  <br><br>As I understand it, the nutshell is to answer questions and write what you think about your present situation, then write about what your ideal would be, say 3 years from now, and what would be the worst outcome 3 years from now, and then use those three perspectives to drive you to make choices that lead away from the evil and towards the good.<br><br>The program sounds similar in concept to Marks "Dreams" book, so I'm curious what other people think of it, or at least think of the discussion:<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kdnmT_7gLE" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kdnmT_7gLE</a></div>

<div class="content">Thanks for this, Alan.<br><br>I started watching the video and then finished off with the audio version from Freedomain Radio.<br><br>It's very stimulating. The idea of taking conscious control of your life is inspiring - especially for the school and college kids that Peterson is taking this stuff to.<br><br>I haven't committed to the course, but it's prompted me to think again about resuming journalling.<br><br>Molyneux and Peterson share a very particular politics, but I don't think anyone should find it interferes with the value of their message. Likewise, Peterson uses a lot of Christian references and symbolism, though I'm not sure whether he professes to be a Christian. I'm not a Christian, but this too was no problem at all for me.<br><br>Peterson makes huge claims for the efficacy of the course in boosting academic performance. I'll be interested to find out if other researchers confirm that.<br><br>Chris</div>

<div class="content">I think Jordan Peterson cites James Pennebaker as the originator of his method. Pennebaker did an interview on the bbc about it: <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01blrcp" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01blrcp</a><br><br>Writing also appears to speed up the healing of wounds: <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0514dnx" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0514dnx</a><br><br>I was so intrigued I signed up for Peterson's authring program which has been err challenging.</div>

<div class="content">Journalling is a popular topic for papers. Based on the psychology sites I finally stopped spending time on, it works better than just thinking about things. Writers naturally stop ruminating and start examining and planning. You see things more objectively when they're on paper. It forces you to put things into words (or pictures), not think around the topic. Handwritten works better than typing in most studies, but not all. No studies done on shorthand vs longhand. Writing about past trauma helps. Several studies agree on that, details vary. At least one found that it makes writers feel worse in the short term, but six months later they do better. Processing in any therapy method often reopens wounds before it heals them. Every study on daily gratitude, as specific or vague as you like, shows it helps. Doing it every day for a few weeks seems to be enough for long-lasting (6 month) changes. Doing it for longer doesn't seem to help, but a refresher week can be useful.<br><br>I did it daily for months, then suddenly stopped. Three gratitude, quick note on each family member and activities, topic of the day from list of suggestions from <br><a href="http://www.bakadesuyo.com/2013/07/personal-writing" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.bakadesuyo.com/2013/07/personal-writing</a><br>and then anything at all until three pages filled. Sometimes shallow, sometimes deep. Sometimes reflective, sometimes vague goals, sometimes detailed planning. I think those were productive months, too. Cause or effect or both? I need to restart that experiment.</div>
