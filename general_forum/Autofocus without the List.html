<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">Having achieved a record 5,322 individual visitors on this site yesterday (and even more so far today), I should be happy. <br><br>But no!<br><br>I have been stung by a couple of people commenting that at the end of the day, Autofocus is a to do list. To my mind that's a bit like saying that a Rolls-Royce is an engine. <br><br>It's certainly true that a Rolls wouldn't go very far without it's engine. But is Autofocus dependant on its list?<br><br>My hypothesis is "No, it's not". So I am now going to experiment with running AF without using the list. At all. I'm not even going to look at it.<br><br>Having been using AF for a couple of months now, I feel that it's had a very definite training effect on my mind. I now want to see what that training can achieve on its own.<br><br>I strongly counsel you not to try this at home (and especially not at work!). Therefore I'm not going to share the exact method I'm going to use - at least not until I've proved to myself that it works.<br><br>Whether it will work or not I have not the faintest idea. But you will probably be able to tell by the quantity and quality of work you see emanating from me on this website, discussion forum and blog.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>I'm sure you will be successful.  Once you get on a roll, you kind of know what has to be done.  I remember a line in a book on investing (by Adam Smith ... no, not the old one ;-) which went along the lines of:<br><br>"When you really know what's going on, you don't even have to know what's going on to know what's going on."<br><br>Words to live buy ;-)<br><br>As to being stung ... I'm not sure why ... AF is not a list ... it is a WAY to USE a list.  Another way is to put it away and forget it ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Mark<br><br>It will be very interesting to see the results of your experiment.  I can appreciate the concept of the mind being trained by AF - certainly things that I do "off list" are changing as a result of AF but I can't imagine life without my "Rolls Royce"!</div>

<div class="content">Mark: I too was stung (on your behalf) by the comments about it just being a to-do list - so much so that I've submitted a comment encouraging people to try it out before they dismiss it (no pun intended).</div>

<div class="content">Mark, isn't every task management approach fundamentally a to-do list? The difference is in how one approaches that list, whether it's paper, electronic, or in one's head. No system is for everyone. But your system appears to be effective for most of us! Please rejoice in the criticism as it's a sign of success. No one bothers to criticize someone who isn't doing anything big. It also seems as if the critics haven't tried AF. These are the types who want something so complex that it seems genius. True genius is simplicity. You're on to something big! So study if you must (as a psychologist trained in research, I feel compelled to also), but know that your instincts are right on.</div>

<div class="content">Don't be stung.  The original beta-testers were probably people who are already familiar with your counsel.  New folks coming over from Lifehacker are going to have no background knowledge to "get" the system right away.  If they try it--and follow the directions--then they'll get it.  The only thing you can do is to keep being awesome and explaining why it works.  Maybe you could offer to go on a "blog tour" to be interviewed and answer questions about AF on other productivity blogs to better get the word out.  Not so much to promote the system but to frame and define it the way you'd like.</div>

<div class="content">Well, I love this AF "Rolls Royce" too. (I mean, a Porsche is just a glorified car? sheesh) I also admit that I "use" AF without the AF list too! In other words, not sure how to put this, but it has also changed what I do "off-list" which helps just as much as what I do ON-list, and I've considered that part of the (common sense?) "AF magic" from the beginning. <br><br>(Mel, I really liked your list as to why AF works on the other thread. On an ordinary "to-do" list I would never allow myself to cross anything off the list until it was DONE, which was rather demotivating at times... )</div>

<div class="content">I just added a comment to Lifehacker, but I guess it's awaiting moderation, because I still don't see it (hope it didn't evaporate).  My comment addressed some of the naysayer comments, based on my experience with AF.  <br><br>Right now, the Lifehacker item has gotten 22,966 views.  Worry about a handful of naysayers (what fraction of views resulted in naysaying comments)?  Nah.  If it spurs you to push out the frontier?  Sure, why not.  <br><br>I haven't kept up with any Lifehacker fallout comments on this site, so I don't know about that yet.  But, I'll bet that's a small number too compared to how many have come to the site.  You did say "stung by a couple of people commenting."  Hey, what are all of us fans, chopped liver?</div>

<div class="content">I wrote the first reply to the original post about AF being a to-do list. And I've been using the system since Day One. Unfortunately I didn't mean it to read it was 'only' a to-do list, but anybody who starts of with "Hi, I don't mean to be incendiary..." is obviously looking to start a flame war IMO. Actually, I thought pretty much everybody was going to ignore the thread. Shows what I know, huh?</div>

<div class="content">Mark<br>Thnaks for sharing your feelings.<br>Yes,AF IS a to do list.<br>But then there are "todo lists" that are easy to make and resist doing and then there are to do lists with a simple intuititve method to actually do them (AF).<br>I do not think one should compare AF to any other to do list,because there's no way to objectively do that-the only criterion should be how far AF has worked for someone since they FIRST started using it:or how their productivity has changed since starting to use it.<br>And going by the number of people with positive feedback here,it's working great.<br>I've been a productivity junkie and visited various other productivity sites.The plethora of systems there is mind boggling (perhaps testimony to the fact that they don't work too well?).I don't visit these sites anymore because anything and everything that can be possibly interpreted as a tool for productivity is hailed and celebrated there without being tested ther.<br>How many to do lists have had such a massive beta test?None that I know of.<br>How many to do lists have the kind of participation and support that this forum has had?And free of charge?<br>I think it's time to ignore these negative criticisms and focus on autofocus (pun intended!).<br><br>l look forward to your experiment without the list.Speaking for myself I would be too scared to even contemplate that!<br>Jay<br></div>

<div class="content">Now the Lifehacker item has had 27,427 page views.  How many naysayer comments?  I rest my case.</div>

<div class="content">In a way, I can understand the naysayers opinions on the matter.  I must admit that my first thought swhen I read through the instructions were "is that it?", and "it seems too simple to work well".  For some reason, I think it's difficult to visualise in advance just how well AF works, you really have to try it.  Which is basically what I wrote in LH (I had to join up to post, so it might take a while to be approved)</div>

<div class="content">All please note that when I said I was stung by a couple of comments I was using hyperbole.<br><br>I'm sure you all know what that means but, if you don't, copy "define: hyperbole" (without the quotes) into your Google search box.</div>

<div class="content">Autofocus isn't a task list.  It's a dynamic process for working with your task lists.<br><br>That's the distinction that the naysayers who haven't tried it are missing.<br><br>And it's a brilliant & deceptively simple process, I might add.</div>

<div class="content">Well, that experiment didn't last long. It worked well for a day, but then I just found myself drifting. So the answer (for me anyway) to "Autofocus without the list?" is "No!"<br><br>I'd be interested to hear how you get on, Slothbear.</div>

<div class="content">Mark<br><br>I'm finding that some items sort of wander off my lists on their own but then periodically return.  I found this initially with routine tasks, that whereas I had started by listing them, once I had gotten into a pattern, or AF had prompted me to change the way in which I did them for some reason, it just seemed unnecessary or inappropriate to return them to my lists.  However, every so often it feels the right things to do to put them back for a while.<br><br>I am now starting to find that a lot of my project tasks are "wandering off" as well.  Initially I would do something on a project and readd it to the end of my list, but I have been so prompted to overhaul my project management system that virtually all of my projects have temporarily placed themselves within my project management system awaiting review.  I have regular tasks to review my system, which is picking up anything that has any degree of urgency, and any project related individual tasks are still within my lists.  I have no doubt that those projects will return to the lists in due course when the time is right, and I am totally confident that nothing is being missed, but at the moment they are not in my list as such, although are indirectly through my "review project management" task.<br><br>AF is becoming in a way the glue that holds everything together - but without it - no way!  To me my list IS the point of focus!</div>

<div class="content">LOL. I'm not surprised. I think the little and often approach carries on even without a list, but I NEED the list!</div>

<div class="content">About AF & glue:<br><br>I think that key difference between AF and traditional to-do list is that<br>to-do-list is created ad hoc and it will not necessarily be reviewed regularly.<br>AF list is kind of "engine" which cycles.<br><br><br></div>
