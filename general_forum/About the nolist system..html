<div class="content">Little post just to tell you what happened with me with the no list system I have tried since a week now. Well, the result is a total wash out. <br><br>As with the list I was doing more or less the most important things quiet fastly, the no list sytem led me directly crash to the wall making me doing not the most important things but what I felt urging more or less and pleased me. I have increased my procrastination by a 100% spending a lot of time in the clouds instead of doing real oprationnal things.<br><br>Check list were OK, habits OK too but real difficulties about acting on the flow...<br><br>Here is what happened :<br> <br>Negative :<br>- No feeling about things, <br>- No intuition, <br>- Un able to know what is next and necessary doing now about projects and goals<br>- Doing wrong things instead of doing the right thing at the right moment, <br>- Feeling of confusion and lost about what to do and when, <br>- Lose of self confident in the system and in me, <br>- Little list of stuff done but after daily control not the important things most of the time <br>- I Forgot 2 important dead lines and was unable doing what I ought to do...<br>- Lack of implication in task and projects <br>- Lack of visualisation about the global system all what stuck in the molasse of my mind, <br>- Un able to choose the right things to do when a stone get into the system ie 5 tasks written, at <br>the same time incoming huge and important interuption. My brain was just un able to choose what to do next...<br><br>Positive <br>- Easy controling at the end of the day. <br>- Feeling of doing things right (but is was a mirage)<br>- No list, so no control<br>- Fast to control my project list and goals (but no global view)<br><br>So I decided to stop the experiment yesterday morning getting back to a list and planning stuff as I explained before. Since the results has increased by a 100% and I feel much better ! <br><br>My system has evoluated by basics as I explained before in another post using GTD, MF and Mac cormack principles. <br><br>So the system OF NO LIST is not convenient for every body. For me it is the worst system I ever tried. But now I know what to avoid and how. It was necessary to give it a try. <br><br>Thoughts ?</div>

<div class="content">Jupiter:<br><br>Thank you for trying it. I think I've said several times to you individually and many times to everyone collectively "If you find a system that works for you, stick to it".</div>

<div class="content">Sure ! <br><br>I will ! I admit I love testing your systems. Some has changed my life and improoved my results considerably. Questionning is one of them. AF1 too (limited to what is only actionable for less than one week (I do my weekly review on thursday) the stand out system (Cf AF1) and I forget many tips I learned here for years which has increased my efficiency. <br><br>About my previous post as you said some kind of systems works for some, nor for others. That's all I meant. <br><br>Now that's said I am please to tell you that my own system is near to the end. I tooks my a few years but the systems works naturaly. So I stick to it and improove it little by little (Other incredible MF rule I love) <br><br>It is very powerfull but indeed simple. If you are interested I may make a post about it and explain how it works. It is a mix of GTD, Bullet journal (yes it works on paper and I am proud of it !) it's also use computer, It use MF list AF/FV List and his core system is guided by planification, visualisation and heuristic scheme, Jane westmann principle, Mac cormack principle and my own research. So it is a mixt of little things like bricks builded one by one. <br><br> Explained like that it seems complicated. Using it is so simple ! . You just need to stay focus and put the information at the right places. <br><br>The results is an incredible simplicity and efficiency without any efforts except for planification. With a computer and a good paper notebook it is easy and so powerfull in business.</div>

<div class="content">Jupiter:<br><br><<  If you are interested I may make a post about it and explain how it works.>><br><br>Yes, please do. I would be very interested - and I'm sure many others would be too.<br><br>Will you be putting it in French on your own blog as well?</div>

<div class="content">"Yes, please do. I would be very interested - and I'm sure many others would be too".<br>OK I gona write something about it. It will take a little time because it is a global system and I still need to test the end of it (Daily actions)<br><br>Will you be putting it in French on your own blog as well?<br>Not yet. I deserve it to you first. Then may be later.</div>

<div class="content">@Jupiter, yes, please post. May I suggest post soon, and not wait until all solved. After all, you said a few years in development. You could still spend a few more years, or rest of your life perfecting. If you get it out now, then we all might learn from and even give back some ideas to you :)<br><br>>> With a computer and a good paper notebook it is easy and so powerfull in business.<br><br>Does it work with paper OR computer, or does it need paper AND computer?</div>

<div class="content">Hello ! OK - As promised I give you the basic and let's see after. <br><br>***PAPER***<br><br>I. CONTROL :<br>you will need 3 spiral paper A4 note book . keep 2 pages at the beginning for summary. Number pages. <br><br>*One in for all incoming information*. Just collect all what is incoming. I mean information not tasks. This is crucial. IE I receive information about building and client's needs. They goes in there. Date each day. Separates all information regarding to each people. IE I receive a call about Henri who speaks about building, research, negociation I write HENRY x, y, z one under the other and then I cross a line. Read it regularly. cross what you dont need anymore. You may add ideas, emails, notes about something the important is crossing after to see it and dating to know when. <br><br>*One is for task* Collect all tasks. Just collect AF way. One under the other. A waiting for write !<br>a task write ! dont use color or anything. Just write one under the other. Make ⅔ pages for crucial list mine are BUSINESS/OPPORTUNITIES- OBLIGATION- PERSONNAL STUFF. These list are extracted from the main list and listed. They are my crucial guidline per day. I treat them in a AF way but with no dissmissal as I cross everything little by little during my daily and weekly review. The list is just a warehouse for controling, thinking and doing on a daily basis. If something stand at me I do it. <br><br>*One is your historical note book" it is your journal. Note what you think, what happen and DATE ! Mine looks like this sunday 28th it happened this week this and this, I thougy that and that. Regarding to the situation I would do this and this. Use MF questioning Why and how. If you need during the day to think about something use it. Make a clear separation betweek items. Makes titles. <br><br>***COMPUTER***<br><br>*Create a folders ACTIVE* > It is your project list ie ORGANISATION > BUILDING X, Client Y<br><br>*Create a folders REFERENCES* > It is your GTD references (ie building plans, lease, acount..-<br>You will note in each file all historical stuff coming from your papers note book during your weekly review. <br><br>II. PERSPECTIVE :<br>This is a crucial part. Here your make a vision of What happened, were you are and where you are going to. <br><br>In developpement the basic idea is using heuristic schemes to vision short and long term goals/ <br>Also use files for detailling goals like this GOAL X - I vision THIS- The steps are X, Y, Z<br>> Report steps in agenda for control > Report steps in your task list. <br><br>DO you weekly review on thursday. report everywhere so you can act on wednesday about urgencies. <br><br><br>What is the effect with me. <br><br>Collecting incoming information is fantastic. I can take my note book with me and find any information about anything in front of my clients. No needs other list exept building list and clients list (they are on excel because of calc and yields.)<br><br>Collecting the general list free me. I dont control anything. I feel quiet. I know every tasks is in there. When I am outside I collect on a piece of paper I have all the time with me (with a pen) I jot all information, tasks, ideas then they will be reported on my papers notebook and agenda if necessary. <br><br>Journaling is great I see the progress. I can read all at a glance. I highline important things everywhere when I am reluctant or if I need to focus on a special and important thing. <br><br>I never forget any thing. The core system is my daily and weekly review. I am building process (habits) to do things. Ie my habit is planning for now One project per day. Nothing else. I jot on my agenda DO projet X on monday. <br><br>I take time blocked for thinking about complicated project or stratégies. <br><br>As you see the basic idea is to make a clear separation between control and perspective. To keep intuition. To avoid computer except for what is absolutly necessary. To cross little by little unusefull information during the daily review (I use check list) To keep focus on goals. <br><br>There is nothing complicated. I only use specific list I i need it. The system cost nothing. It is always operational. When I am with a client I have my collect book. When I am at my office I use all books and computer.<br><br>In fact I did date realizing that I was fed up of complicated systems. Questions and organizational systems. During one meditation I realized that my brain perfectly know what to do and that I needed to trust my gut and intuition. I spent a little time doing AF MF list then Jane westmann which was similary except in the treatement. Then I realized that I needed a guidline I made a list of goals, after I planed my day strictely (Mac cormack) then I used covey and Eisenhowen rules (extracting core items in A, B, C, D) and now I am back to essential. I realized sudently that I had to many information, to many things to do and that my real problem was that I am un able to settle time. I mean to know at a glance when happened something (was it in 93 ? in 2003 ?) it is really complicated for me. So dating everything settle time. I even date time. Clients are sometime astonished when I say we spoke about thins and this on last tuesday at 4:25PM . I dont have a good memory about this. I only have a good note book. Reading it regularly helps me to decide what is the best for me. <br><br>Hope that's help.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks hope every one reads it and help me to optimize my global system ! For now it work for years ! so I stick to it even I improved each paper note book (simplification). <br><br>There is another thing about the effect I forgot. As a commercial I need to call people, call them again, and again, following them and so on... I had list and list for that it was complicated. The incoming information has solved this. I just read pages and pages, reporting the last date and making a new note sumarized about someone when it becomes complicated. I plan the next call on my global list like this mars 15th - Call John appleseed [Project] > talks about x and Y what's about Z ? If it is far away I put it eitheir on my diary or on a Tikler file computer or physical  dated by month.</div>

<div class="content">Little present for those who like omnifocus and digital way <br><br>I discovered I could do the same than my task paper note book using only context in of and a single action list. So I made a weekly context list (all things I intend to do this week, follow (all things I want to follow) Tickler for up coming stuff shortly and smb (someday may be task) for all task over the horizon. I put some dead line for using the forecast view. <br><br>On a daily basis I flag what i intend to do per day <br><br>all that is exactly what I did on paper except that it is faster and as a very nice advantage ie finding everything. I dont classified them in project for going faster. The project is writen in the task. <br><br>another advantage is to see in the forecast perspective my project of the day<br><br>At last I can have my tasks everywhere. This is very helpful for ideas. As I am getting older ideas comes everywhere. <br><br>The two others papers note book stay as they are. Fully opérational. It is just a way to make things easier. <br><br>Hope that's help.</div>

<div class="content">Jupiter- I was impressed by the similarity of your system with systems I have developed over the years.  I have a question about a part I didn't understand <br>< Make 2/3 pages for crucial list mine are....><br>Would you explain this some more? Thanks.</div>

<div class="content">Hi @Sarah <br><br>I also appreciate a lot what you write. Sometime some of them are also close from what I do my self. It is interesting. Anyway, <br><br>*One is for task* Collect all tasks. Just collect AF way. One under the other. A waiting for write !<br>a task write ! dont use color or anything. Just write one under the other. Make ⅔ pages for crucial list mine are BUSINESS/OPPORTUNITIES- OBLIGATION- PERSONNAL STUFF. These list are extracted from the main list and listed. They are my crucial guidline per day.

The list is just a warehouse for controling, thinking and doing on a daily basis. If something stand at me I do it"<br><br>These crucial list are kind of check list or project list to remind me my most important big rocks. <br><br>BUSINESS for example is a list of all my business opportunities it can be like this <br>Croissy / Signature X with client Z<br>Rome / Make secont visit with client Z <br><br>OBLIGATION <br>Account : Accountant must close the account April 15th <br>VAT : Tax must be closed and paid at march 10 th. <br><br>These crucial list are my guidlines. I alway read them  before beginning the day. <br><br>Hope that's clear. <br><br>-- <br>From what I wrote here my system is evoluating for a part to a kind of DIT. I noticed DIT system make me quiet and efficient. Of Course I kept the system as I explained before for it major part but for the moment all is on page. Digital is bad for me</div>

<div class="content">OK, got part of that.   What is "2/3 pages?"  How you divide a page, pages in the book, or something else? Thanks.</div>

<div class="content">Sarah Jane:<br><br>I think Jupiter means "two or three pages", not "two-thirds of a page".<br><br>So it should read:<br><br>"Make two or three pages for crucial lists.  Mine are 1) BUSINESS/OPPORTUNITIES 2) OBLIGATIONS 3) PERSONAL"</div>
