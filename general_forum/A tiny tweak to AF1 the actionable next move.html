<div class="content">Some of my entries on my AF1 list are not immediately actionable because they are too vague or generalised. In such cases I put a dash after the heading and think of the first actionable step. For example:<br><br>"weekend away?"<br><br>becomes<br><br>"weekend away? - check website X for holiday deals this weekend"<br><br>which can become<br><br>"weekend away? - check website X for holiday deals this weekend - book south coast stay on website Y"<br><br>The process helps me get clear on the next actionable step.</div>

<div class="content">michael:<br><br>My method is somewhat similar to yours. To use the same example as yours I write "Weekend Away?", and then I use the question to generate a series of tasks related to it. Some of these might be further questions, from which further tasks will be generated.</div>
