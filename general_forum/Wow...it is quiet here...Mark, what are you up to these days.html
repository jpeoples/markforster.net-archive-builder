<div class="content">It is an internet thing.  There has to be a critical mass of posts to keep things flowing.  Notice that when a bunch of us post then lots of others chime in.  When there is not enough going on to interest us, the others don't have anything to respond to.  It is self-perpetuating.  If one or two of us stop chattering about the GED program, things will fall very silent again.</div>

<div class="content">While I do think the ride may be over as far as time management is concerned, as many people (me excluded) have selected AF4 as the ultimate. there is much terrain yet to be covered.  For example, the Dreams book which doesn't get much play on here.  It is great to be able to objectively choose your activities as in AF4, but what about selecting goals in the first place?  What about the Dreams concept of self-coaching?</div>

<div class="meta">2009-11-8 7:13</div>
<div class="content">TK: Indeed, "Dreams" was an intriguing book, it resonated with me far more than many of the other stuff out there. The self coaching, the what's better list, the present reality - all very original and fresh thinking in a sea of SMART goal-oriented material we see all the time.<br><br>I too hope there is a revival in this area. My coach needs coaching!</div>

<div class="content">I for one need to spend less time obsessing about "how to achieve" and spend more time "actually achieving" at the moment that actually means working out "what" it is I want to achieve.  The Internet now eats away as much of my time as the TV used to.</div>

<div class="content">This has been an amazing forum. I learned a lot here and AF4 is a great tool.<br><br>BUT: I have the feeling we are working at the "low end" of things. What about dreams of the great life, inspiring goals, how to find and clarify goals etc.? This is FAR more important imho than any time management "technique" (while no doubt useful).<br><br>Renfrew</div>

<div class="content">Hi Walter - thanks!  You made my day.  :-)<br><br>I'm not using AF4 or any version of AF at the moment - but am using many of the principles - standing out, little and often, etc. and DIT (w/current initiatives on steroids) - so there hasn't been much for me to talk about as you guys have gone into technical stuff about lists and such.  And I've been super busy and (mostly) super motivated, I guess.  I'm still keeping lists, but not the same way.<br><br>Like Renfrew and Anon (Again) above, I'm more into the "what" am I doing, rather than the "how".  <br><br>There's always the danger for me of getting better, stronger, faster at stuff that really isn't that important in the grand scheme of things.  So I've been playing around with methods of putting more emphasis on what's important to me and less of what isn't.  Although it shouldn't be, it really is kind of difficult.  ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Welcome back, Jacqueline. Yes, I suspect AF 4.5 may deal with giving a little more directed attention to major projects. I am still putting everything into AF4, though Mike and others have dealt with this issue (correct me if I'm wrong, Mike) by filtering what actually gets in to the list in the first place, so the lawn mower runs faster.<br><br>Perhaps AF4.5 might be a two tiered system, with most of the time spent processing things in a primary tier. Or a notebook with two ends, with a mechanism for copying primary tasks from the everything end to the executable end.<br><br>Is anyone else finding it is gradually taking longer to draw the next line, or is it just me?<br><br>I hasten to add that I really like AF4, and it truly appeals to me. I just do not yet feel it is Nirvana. But for that one supposedly has to sit still and beam. A different concept.</div>

<div class="content">Laurence & Jacqueline : All very important and good points, definitely. I don't have difficulty drawing the line, and have settled to using AF2 which deals very nicely for the faster pace I am faced with. If the back portions are not adequately dealt with, the threat of dismissal of a large block of tasks does its work in maintaining my discipline.<br><br>The problem I do have is wondering whether I have a compass. Am I doing the task in accordance with my desired goals? I know these are questions I should pose in AF itself, and allow my thoughts to develop over time. I don't spend enough time working on the concepts in "Dreams", I know that.<br><br>But I'd rather just live with this angst and allowing AF to bring this up for me to work on, rather than tweaking the system drastically to fit any self perceived notions of a lack in my daily work.</div>

<div class="content">To expand on what I said on another thread yesterday:<br><br>The name Autofocus comes from photography. Most modern cameras don't just have autofocus, they also automatically adjust the aperture, shutter speed, ISO and colour balance, and sometimes a lot more as well. They make it much easier for you to do your job - which is to point the camera in the right direction.<br><br>It's the same with AFs 1-4. They are tools which will make it much easier for you to do your work, but you still have to point yourself in the right direction.</div>

<div class="content">Good Morning Laurence,<br><br><<<  Welcome back, Jacqueline. <<<<br><br>YES!  We've missed you!<br><br>>>>  Yes, I suspect AF 4.5 may deal with giving a little more directed attention to major projects. I am still putting everything into AF4, though Mike and others have dealt with this issue (correct me if I'm wrong, Mike) by filtering what actually gets in to the list in the first place, so the lawn mower runs faster.  <<<<br><br>Basically, you are right, but it comes down to terminology.  I have settled on putting EVERYTHING in my AF book, but is that really AF if I immediately delete things ... which I do.  Or does it become AF once the first deltions take place?  I'm not sure we need an AF 4.5.  I think it becomes a question of using the system in the way that works best for you.<br><br>I like Mark's analogy to a camera.  You really do have to decide what you want to take the picture of before you let the camera do it's magic and adjust the focus for you.  I do not think that has to be built into AF as we know it now.  I think you do that FIRST, and then use AF to execute.<br><br>It is the same with scheduling.  As I have said, I cull out urgent items and run them from a list EXTERNAL to AF, then do AF when I'm not attending to them.  Can AF do that for me?  Well, not for me, but obviously for Mark and others.  But I have no angst about it.  The point is to not keep a system "pure" but to make the system ultimately vanish because it is just the way things get done for you.<br><br>>>>  Perhaps AF4.5 might be a two tiered system, with most of the time spent processing things in a primary tier. Or a notebook with two ends, with a mechanism for copying primary tasks from the everything end to the executable end.  <<<<br><br>Then my advise would be to just do that for yourself it it seems like it would work.  If you want to know what works for me:<br><br>- Weekly review my short term goals in the context of my intermediate and long term goals,<br><br>- Derive a list of weekly goals from that review,<br><br>- Derive a list of tasks to accomplish those goals,<br><br>- Block time in the upcoming week to work on those tasks,<br><br>- Each day review my blocked time and urgent items and plan my day,<br><br>- Work that plan,<br><br>- When I think of things put them on the AF list,<br><br>- Decide if they WILL get done before the next review period,<br><br>- if not, delete them right then (to get them out of the road)<br><br>- Work the AF list when I'm not working my blocked time or urgent tasks.<br><br>As you can see, my direction comes from the weekly review.  My focus comes from my task list first, my scheduled blocks of time second, then my AF list third.<br><br>>>>  I hasten to add that I really like AF4, and it truly appeals to me. I just do not yet feel it is Nirvana. But for that one supposedly has to sit still and beam. A different concept.  >>><br><br>LOL ;-)  I'd have to say that MY system is "nirvana".  That is to say that I've fine tuned it and it works like a charm for me and my context.  Were I suddenly to change my life style, I'd guess that my way of working would change to accommodate that.</div>

<div class="content">Point taken, Mark!<br><br>Question for me remains, how to make sure you spend some time thinking about what your own "right direction" is.  I've found that the dismissal process in AF1-4 helps a lot to sift out the stuff that's the wrong direction; but I've still got to figure out a way to think more or less systematically about what my right direction is.  I've tried writing down goals periodically in the past, but reviewing them was always very discouraging so I stopped doing that.  Any pointers on how to go about formulating goals, and stick to using them as compass, would be very helpful!</div>

<div class="content">Pick one goal, put it on your list.  Work on the goal as AF brings you to it.<br><br>Work on that goal consists of: (1) making sure that's really your goal, (2) thinking (planning) about how to get to that goal.  This planning will be in a separate goal-planning page/folder.  (3) Adding initial tasks relating to your goal into the AF list.  The goal itself can be taken off the list now if the tasks cover it.<br><br>When you finish a goal-related task, think if there's another goal-related task that needs to be added to the list, and add it.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-11-10 13:59</div>
<div class="content">Nicole,<br><br>Why has reviewing been discouraging?  I would find goal review discouraging if I did not do it weekly, for example.  The point of reviewing goals is to make course corrections when you can do something to change the outcome.  I found that only weekly reviews makes sense.<br><br>What gives goals power is the reason you set them.  So it helps if you know exactly why you want your goals and to keep that reason right in front of you.  An example, perhaps?<br><br>Long Term Goal: "Climb Mt. Everest.<br><br>Reason: "To see the world from one of the highest places and feel the sense of excitement that comes from doing that."<br><br>Intermediate Goal: "Climb Mt. McKinley"<br><br>Short Term Goals: (One Month to One Year)<br>- Find Schools<br>- Join Health Club<br>- Buy Climbing Gear<br><br>Next Weeks Tasks:<br>- Call Health Clubs<br>- Buy Climbing Books<br>- Subscribe to Climbing Magazines<br><br>So I'm set for the next week.  A week goes by and I review,  Suppose I did none of my tasks this week.  What is the worst that I'll feel?  I'll feel  only slightly disspaointed and I've not done irreversable damage to my goals because it is only three small tasks and one week lost.  Very recoverable.  I feel more motivated than ever.<br><br>Contrast that with not breaking it down to small tasks and short term goals and reviewing only monthly or yearly.  Then I would feel very badly because the loss would be greater.<br><br>So my suggestion is that you pick ONE lifetime goal and break it down until you reach the one week tasks stage then review weely and each weekly review see the progress you have made and create more tasks to help you get to your short term goal.<br><br>If you get more ambitious, work through the exercises in this book:<br><br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Control-Your-Time-Life-Signet/dp/0451167724/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1257861408&sr=1-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Control-Your-Time-Life-Signet/dp/0451167724/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1257861408&sr=1-1</a></div>

<div class="content">Hi Nicole,<br><br>It sounds like you're getting discouraged because you think your progress *should* be further ahead?  Or you're comparing yourself to the ideal maybe?<br><br>I think most people overestimate how much progress we can make on goals and still have a normal life.   Part of that's probably related to media etc. - ie. people on the Biggest Loser can lose 20 pounds a week, so I can't be happy with my measly one pound.<br><br>I think Alan's way of adding tasks to the list above can work really well for some people.  I know that I work a little better having one major focus for the month or a "season".   Like many people who write a novel in a month on nanowrimo - they gear their every spare moment to writing that book.<br><br>I'd start my list by watching the movie "The Bucket List" - the whole thing is posted on youtube.<br><br>Then I'd follow a simple system like this:<br><a href="http://www.squidoo.com/100things" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/100things</a><br><br>And see what really pops out at you to add to your AF list.  The one that makes you go WOW, I'd LOVE to do that.  You could also find a picture or piece of writing that represents that to go in your book.<br><br>I wouldn't focus on the measuring myself against where I think I should be then as long as I'm following a good process.  How do you really know how far you *should* get if you've never done it before?</div>

So you change the date to Y+3months. Or the goal to X-15%. Either way you set up the mindset that you "never" reach your goals, so why bother?

<div class="content">Wow, thanks for all the replies!<br><br>My problem with reviewing goals is that because I don't review them regularly, it's disappointing to see how little progress I've made when I do review them.  Or sometimes I've even totally abandoned a goal without realizing it at the time.  That suggested to me that I haven't been writing done my "right" goals, but as I already wrote, for some reason I never get around to really thinking about my "right" goals. Making it a task in AF hasn't helped so far, probably because I'm a bit uncomfortable thinking about goals, and not knowing how to start makes me skip over the task "review goals" until it's dismissed.  Maybe I should just have a go at one or two methods suggested here, and put those in AF to see how that works out.<br><br>Anyway, thanks for all the suggestions, I'll post back here about my progress!</div>

<div class="content">Hey Nicole, <br><br>Start small!  If you have more than a very few goals going at once , you'll inevitably find you aren't making much progress on any of them.  Read the Power of Less blog/book referenced in another thread.  It's very good about goals.<br><br>What I learned from that: Look at all your potential goals and choose the One you really want to do first.  If it's a big goal, define smaller subgoals.  Make sure you truly get started towards that goal.  <br><br>Feel free to pursue more than one goal, but if you want to see progress, don't do too many at once.</div>

<div class="content">Well, it WAS quiet here, but then this goal stuff started up again... it brings the yappy ones out of the woodwork.  :-)<br><br>Nicole, I really like this concept of sprinting towards a goal:<br><br><a href="http://geniuscatalyst.com/geniusblog/2009/07/mnct-668-the-art-of-sprinting/" rel="nofollow">http://geniuscatalyst.com/geniusblog/2009/07/mnct-668-the-art-of-sprinting/</a><br><br>Like Alan says, I would just pick one - for one thing it's so much easier to focus on one goal and make sure steps towards it stay on your list.  If you're actively working on it, you shouldn't really have to review your progress if that makes you uncomfortable.  It will take as long as it takes, and that's okay.<br><br>There are also some goals that I have that I like to do on auto-pilot.  If you set up a structure to your life that they just happen automatically, this should be easy.  A certain amount of money going to savings, a time to exercise, Friday night date nights, etc.<br><br>The other thing I've found is that once you've written things down, your "reticular activating system" will go to work for you to "filter in" opportunities.  On my goals list 5 years ago was to live in a house with a library and a wood burning fireplace.  I'm not a believer in the law of attraction, but not too long after writing that down, I did find a house that had both of those features - in the same room.  Would I have found it without defining some of the things I wanted?  Maybe.<br><br>I think of listing goals as something really fun to do every once in awhile and it at least gives you a starting point, even if you don't actively manage them.  Even if you do something as simple as list the places that you'd like to see one day, the next time you plan your vacation, instead of just mindlessly choosing a place to go based on where your friends would go or the ads you get from travel places online, you can instead look at your list at all the places *you* REALLY want to see and choose something from there.<br><br>All the best and good luck!</div>

<div class="content">Lillian, I totally agree with you on the time thing with respect to goals.  So many of my goals are things I've never done before or have factors somewhat beyond my control, so how can the time to complete them be estimated?  <br><br>It reminds me of when my oldest kid was little and I would look at the medical books for the time he *should* start walking or talking and I'd be stressed out when it didn't happen on schedule.  But it happened when it happened.  I could have saved myself some anxiety by not worrying about it.<br><br>I think that any time that you have a "deadline" for things that aren't meant to be deadlined, it can be demotivating.  Yeah, if you're training for a marathon at a certain date, it's probably a good thing to have sub-goals that are broken down over time, but for most things, whether you get it done in one month or three, what's the big deal?</div>

A static goal is not all that useful.  Feedback is an essential component of any goal seeking system.  Goal seeking systems are a negative feedback loop.  They contain a function where the distance to the goal is measured and the system is corrected to keep it on course.  Without that, a goal is pointless.<br><br>And that is exactly why goals fail ... no feedback.  We set a goal and don't review our progress and so wander off course.

If it intimidates you, then start with something you feel you really want that will take maybe a year or less.  Then break that down into shorter subgaols then to tasks which can be accomplished in one week.  Then in a week, review and set more week long tasks.  If you missed the target for that week, do some real soul searching.  Put the breaks on ... maybe even go on a retreat in necessary ... and find out WHY!  Without learning why you are not succeeding in taking at least ONE small step toward what is most important to your life, you'll never have what is most important in your life.<br><br>>>>  Or sometimes I've even totally abandoned a goal without realizing it at the time. That suggested to me that I haven't been writing done my "right" goals, but as I already wrote, for some reason I never get around to really thinking about my "right" goals. <<<<br><br>I believe that is correct.  Try that Lakein exercise then.  Basically it consists of writing down, as quickly as possible, everything that comes into your head in answer to several questions.  Questions such as: "If there were no limits, what would I want to do with the rest of my life?" or "If I only had six months to live, how would I spend it?"  The key is to keep writing as fast as you can without censoring ideas because they are "impossible" or "silly".  Then, after waiting a day or so, going back to the list and analyzing it, grouping things into categories and trying to uncover what really lies beneath all of what you wrote.  You WILL see some important yearnings.  Those become your REAL goals.<br><br>>>>  Making it a task in AF hasn't helped so far, probably because I'm a bit uncomfortable thinking about goals, and not knowing how to start makes me skip over the task "review goals" until it's dismissed. Maybe I should just have a go at one or two methods suggested here, and put those in AF to see how that works out.  <<<<br><br>Accept failure as part of the process.  Failure is the feedback we need to correct our course so that we can succeed.  Failure is not something to be ashamed or even avoided.  Paradoxically, failure is essential to achieve success.</div>

Well, it certainly does matter if you intend to take some action about it. To go to extremes, what would be the different in your actions if:<br><br>a) You had to get the house re-decorated before the end of this month?<br><br>or<br><br>b) You had to get the house redecorated by Jan 2020?<br><br>I suggest there would be a radical difference in the actions you would take.

<div class="content">I think the difference between the two - Jan 2010 vs 2012 or 2020 - is the "HAD TO" part.  <br><br>In Lillian's example, there is no "have to", although there is a "want to", so turning 'nice to have' into 'have to have' can be demotivating because she's interested and possibly committed, but it's not necessary. <br><br>Same thing goes if she doesn't HAVE to be in NYC, just wants to be.<br><br>That's just my take anyway.</div>

Firstly, if you check for feedback on Friday for a goal set for Ssaturday, you are not taking feedback soon enough to affect the outcome.  If you set the goal on Monday, you should be checking Monday evening to see what you have accomplished, then Tuesday a couple of times, then Wednesday, etc.  Doing that will not leave you revising the goal at the last minute.  It will allow you (and this is the second point) to revise your ACTIONS so that you can ACHIEVE the goal you set.  IOW, the point is not to move the deadline ever forward, but to alter your actions to achieve the goal.  You are seeing "feedback" as altering the goal rather than the actions which will allow the goal to be achieved.  When the captain of the ship sees that he is off course (or these days, when his computerized nav system does) he does not abandon his goal of getting to port on time ... he moves his rudder and adjusts the power output of his engines.  And he does not wait until he is an hour away from docking to take his position and find he is nearer Greenland than NYC ;-)<br><br>>>>  If the time doesn't matter (and in this case, let's say it really doesn't matter what day I arrive in NYC) why does a date need to be part of a goal? Does a goal really need a date?  <<<<br><br>A goal needs a date, not because the date itself is in any way significant, but to allow us to measure progress.  IOW two goals:<br><br>1) Make $1M<br>2) Make $1M by January 2011<br><br>The first is not considered a goal because there is no point at which you can measure it and say if you have achieved it or not.  If January 2050 comes and goes and I ask you if you made your $1M you can truthfully say: "Not yet but I will."  So there is no accountability.  No way to say that you are on or off course, thus no way to correct your course ... because you don't know if it needs correction or not.<br><br>>>I think that any time that you have a "deadline" for things that aren't meant to be deadlined, it can be demotivating.<<<br><br>Exactly - I need to get my head/motivation around this one.

No, it does not matter WHAT the date is, it matters that there is SOME date.  You will never tell DH that you want to do that if you never have a time pressure of some kind.  If you don't have a date to have it done, then you don't have a date when you need to call the contractor, or consultant, or go to the shops to look at furniture.  If you have no time pressure to do those things, you certainly don't need to bother DH about it ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline,<br><br>>>>  But for her redecorating, she doesn't have to put a target date of estimated completion on it if she just works on it continually and it's done when it's done  <<<<br><br>But the argument is that if there is no end point there is no reason to work little and often, lots and seldom, or even at all.  Mostly people interested in improving time management skills are interested because they find themselves working not at all, on important goals.  "My childhood goal was to be a ballerina, and now I'm 82.  Maybe I should think about considering if maybe I might like to plan to schedule some time to start."  LOL ;-)<br><br>You make a distinction (in another post) between "like to" and "have to".  I contend that until "like to" BECOMES "have to" nothing much happens.  If you read the biographies of very successful people, they always HAD TO ... no matter what it was.  I read a quote by some writer or other (it might have been Azimov) and he said that if he was told he had only one day to live, the only thing he'd change was that he would just type faster.  The most successful people say, over and over, that they do what they do because if they could not they would not find life worth living.  It is all about HAVE TO.<br><br>>>>  (and sometimes those kinds of goals are never officially *done* anyway). <<<<br><br>That can be true -- but it is also another example of thinking of goals as static.  If there is a fixed firm endpoint, and if it is understood that goals are dynamic, then the goal will be altered and what is not "done" is just what was envisioned to start with.  The goal will have been modified many times along the way.  Maybe the redecoration of the living room included the idea of a home theater.  A month into the planning that idea is dropped in favor of library shelves.  Have you "failed" in the goal?  No, the goal is "changed".  Goals are dynamic, not static.  If you change the furniture, carpet and drapes, have you failed in the goal because the kitchen is not done?<br><br>>>>  I don't think most people would or should put an estimated completion date on a goal like that unless they were selling the house or having a family reunion at a certain time or other external event.  <<<<br><br>I can't speak for "most people" but I assure you that I would.  I can also assure you that all clients of decorating consultants and sellers of furniture and drapes will ... because those sellers and consultants want the transaction completed by a certain date or they will not waste their time with you.  They are not in business to experience your dreams, but to make money by selling stuff to people who have fixed end dates.  They don't get paid until they actually deliver the furniture.<br><br>>>>  I could have a goal of $1M net worth by X retirement date but then the market takes a downturn. If it does, I'll likely be upset that I didn't make the date. But if I made a goal of $1M net worth and I don't have a date to pull the plug, I'll just keep on working until I hit the net worth target.  <<<<br><br>Don't you think that the reality is that people without well-formed goals don't work at all on the project?  How many people want "to be rich" and never think of what actions that entails?<br><br>>>>  Yes, I'd still be upset if the market took a downturn but I haven't beaten myself up for not making the predetermined date.  <<<<br><br>See but "beating yourself up" is not driven by the kind of time management system you use, but how you internalize things and relate to your own self-worth.  Those are psychological parameters, not time management ones.  Two different people can experience the same market down turn and one be upset and the other see it as an opportunity to get to his goal that much sooner.  There is no external objective reality in this ... it is all internal evaluation and response.<br><br>>>>  I'd probably have a vague timeframe in mind for when I think I could achieve it based on a savings rate and normal rate of market returns but I'd probably just revise my target net worth down by the amount that I lost and figure out alternative ways to save more so that I could live without having quite $1M. That's the X-15% (or given the 2008 market, X-25%).  <<<<br><br>And that would be an excellent example of a dynamic goal.</div>

OTOH, if you don't have a well-formed goal to get that master's thesis written, you'll never get out of school.  IMO, what determines a process vs. goal oriented approach is the task itself, not the sex of the person doing it.  Things that are more like projects require goals, things that are less, probably benefit from a level of effort approach.  Ex.  Organizing the garage is more of a project and might benefit from a goal approach ... keeping an organized house clean and organized is a level of effort thing ... vacuum weekly, mop the floors every other week, always put things away, etc.<br><br>>>>  And I wouldn't turn that goal from a "want to" to a "have to", I would turn it into a WILL do / REALLY REALLY want to do. <<<<br><br>I can see that point of view.

Then it became a question of if the goals were the right ones.  If you don't have the "right" goals, then suggestions about how to achieve them are kind of beside the point, no?  I mean, putting "small and often" tasks on your AF list does not help if you don't really think you want to do the thing in the first place.<br><br>Also, I don't disagree at all with your approach ... for you.  And I also don't disagree that it works for some things for me ... it is just not that helpful when a real goal is what is needed.  Retiring early seems to have been workable for you with your system.  I'd suggest that it might have more to do with your own personal orientation.  Realize that you are in the financial area so your thinking is probably basically different than many of us.  So for you, looking at a financial goal once in six months might be enough because of your basic thinking and orientation.  AND, I'd also wonder if you were perhaps not aware of how often you really did take the measure of things ... if only subliminally.<br><br>Now I'm not that much interested in the world of finance.  So for me I need to plan to get to a goal and take specific steps and have reminders and milestones and all of that ... or it just never gets done.  And AF won't do it for me for that.  I don't care how many times I see the task on my AF list, I'm going to ignore it ... unless it has the emphasis of a scheduled task because of its importance.  Even something like "charge batteries" (which needs to be done monthly and takes only two seconds of work to plug in the charger) gets put off for weeks because I've got other things on my mind.  AF works brilliantly for some things and not at all for others ... in my case.  Charging the batteries is on my tickler so it gets done ... I respect the urgency of items on the tickler.  Accelerating the pay down on my home equity line of credit is automated so it gets done no matter what.  In fact, what has made the most difference to me personally has been learning what works and what does not.  In my veiw, success is not learning one new tool but having a suite of tools which you know how to apply.  (I.E. habits, ticklers, calendar entries, goals, reviews, someday/maybe list, must do tasks, blocked time, and now AF.  All of those taken together make up my system.  No single one works alone.)<br><br>>>>  Say someone wanted to lose 20 pounds. I think they'd be further ahead by just following a process in their way of eating and exercising and letting the weight take care of itself. Sure, you'd have to do some monitoring to test the effectiveness of your process, but you don't have to tell yourself you HAVE TO lose 2 pounds per week every week to still get there. That's what makes people get unmotivated and quit.  <<<<br><br>And there again, I both agree and disagree.  If you don't set the goal and take feedback you'll just drift.  OTOH, if you don't change lifestyle (a process change) you're just as likely to fail.  So I see it as a bit of both.  As to HAVE to lose 20 pounds ... I can tell you that I did not start to get my weight under control until I got the results of my physical and had to decide if chocolate cake was preferable to living a few more years.  That is a HAVE TO. situation.  And once I got to that mental place, the "process" became easier to stick with ... and it is the PROCESS that is doing the heavy lifting.  I also found that in the beginning I needed feedback to learn the process and later I found feedback motivational.  It sure is much easier to turn your back on the cake after seeing the number on the scale drop in the morning.  Who wants to undo that success?  Personally, I found that if the number went UP for some reason, it was motivation to take a harder look at what I did yesterday ... it was not depressing.  But then, YMMV, of course ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Mike, it seems that with your very approach to AF, you are much more outcome oriented than process oriented than most.  Back in the day when I toyed with the thought of competing in BB, this article was helpful to me in understanding the difference:<br><a href="http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/training/goal-versus-process-oriented-training-part-1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/training/goal-versus-process-oriented-training-part-1.html</a><br><br>The process oriented person would work with the AF system, following the steps and could end up with a backlog (like Nicole, Christine and others - even me) or unmanageable list, then tweak their process.  But those people will usually strive *very* hard (maybe too hard) to stick rigidly to the process rather than listen to what the measurement is telling them because that's the way they're oriented.  The outcome oriented person would tweak their process much sooner based on feedback.  But the process person is usually focused on the process itself as their indicator of how they're doing.  It seems they will also be more interested in keeping stats on how the process is working rather than how they're progressing towards their goals/outcomes.  So the process is more critical to them than the goals themselves.  Even more reason to develop an iron-clad process.<br><br>It's all very interesting, but I still maintain that if measuring in time doesn't work for someone then find what does.  You step on the scale and see your weight went up and feel motivated.  I do the same thing and get frustrated and want to give up - or re-focus on the process.  Organizations like Weight Watchers are built around a process towards a goal (which is not timed, it is completely process oriented).</div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline:<br>Robert Boice fails to mention the gender aspect when studying process-product styles.  But then maybe seeing, a gender distinction in styles, is also gender dependent :)<br><br>Just a quote to illustrate the two process-product styles:<br>"...they (procrastinators) are also relatively unique in maintaining a product (as distinct from process) orientation where they concentrate more on the outcomes they believe they need (for example, ‘‘I’ll need to finish twenty-five pages of good prose this weekend’’) than on ways of learning to work more efficiently and durably (‘‘Maybe I would get more done in the long run if I stopped planning such big goals and just settled into doing a few good pages a day’’ [see Dweck, 1986 for other examples of process versus product styles of problem solving])."

<div class="content">Hey Jacqueline,<br><br>>>>  Mike, it seems that with your very approach to AF, you are much more outcome oriented than process oriented than most. Back in the day when I toyed with the thought of competing in BB, this article was helpful to me in understanding the difference:<br><a href="http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/training/goal-versus-process-oriented-training-part-1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/training/goal-versus-process-oriented-training-part-1.html</a>  >>><br><br>The problem I have with the article is that it confuses outcome (and the method of its achievement ... or lack thereof) with ones reaction to outcome.  It is NOT true that missing a goal MUST cause a person to auger in.  That extreme and self-destructive reaction  to the event is a problem, but it does not flow necessarily from the kind of management system one uses.  Put another way, if the thesis is that goal oriented persons are psychologically unstable because of that orientation ... it is an argument that must be made explicitly ... not simply asserted.<br><br>>>>  The process oriented person would work with the AF system, following the steps and could end up with a backlog (like Nicole, Christine and others - even me) or unmanageable list, then tweak their process. But those people will usually strive *very* hard (maybe too hard) to stick rigidly to the process rather than listen to what the measurement is telling them because that's the way they're oriented. The outcome oriented person would tweak their process much sooner based on feedback. But the process person is usually focused on the process itself as their indicator of how they're doing. It seems they will also be more interested in keeping stats on how the process is working rather than how they're progressing towards their goals/outcomes. So the process is more critical to them than the goals themselves. Even more reason to develop an iron-clad process.  <<<<br><br>That sounds about right to me.<br><br>>>>  It's all very interesting, but I still maintain that if measuring in time doesn't work for someone then find what does.  <<<<br><br>Of course.<br><br>>>>  You step on the scale and see your weight went up and feel motivated. I do the same thing and get frustrated and want to give up - or re-focus on the process. Organizations like Weight Watchers are built around a process towards a goal (which is not timed, it is completely process oriented). <<<<br><br>Well, whatever works.  I don't think, however, that the way you react to a situation is carved in stone.  Sometimes it makes more sense to change the way you react.  Changing that might have longer term and more wide reaching benefits.  Just a thought.<br><br>>>>  Well FWIW Mike, in her response learning confirmed my theory that she's focused on the process, not the outcome - ie. winning. It doesn't mean she doesn't have GOALS, I mean I have goals too, I'm just concerned with the process more than the outcome.  <<<<br><br>Good gosh, we are so different in our perspectives.  I read her response to mean that she is VERY goal oriented.  Yes, she revels in her work, but she is driven by the goal and measures her course by that goal.  What she is NOT, is emotionally enslaved by missing the goal.<br><br>>>>  "the competition is mostly with stretching myself. The trophy or blue ribbon was only superfluous decoration. I've even not placed well in some competitions where I actually felt great about myself."  <<<<br><br>What I read there is that she is not measuring by external EVALUATION of her work.  I make a distinction between internal vs. external evaluation and the method one uses to achieve ones aims (goal vs. process).<br><br>>>>  I shouldn't have said "goal/outcome orientation" when I meant more outcome orientation, because being process oriented doesn't mean that you don't have goals. Obviously someone like Nicole or Lillian has a goal, IIRC, I even told Norman that he has a goal, it just might not be a very good one.  <<<<br><br>I think there are a lot of confusing terms, to be sure.  It is possible to have a goal, but not be goal "oriented" in how one works.  IOW, I want to make $1M but I don't plan my steps and check my progress.  It is also possible to have "dreams" which one thinks are goals.<br><br>>>>  Maybe it's not just women, but even anecdotally on this board I think the theory holds. Or so my E5 personality has observed.  <<<<br><br>ROTF ;-)<br><br>>>>  But I'll let you win this discussion since you're an E5W6, cuz I've had my fun in the process of discussing it. ;-)  <<<<br><br>It's all good.  It is mostly a matter of perspective.</div>

(if you're over 30, make it 5 years) <br>Question #3:<br>"If I knew now I would be struck dead by lightning six months from today, how would I live until then?"<br><br>Like Mike says, best to read the book to put it in context, plus it has excellent advice on time management in general, specifically prioritization.

There's 61 techniques on that, all of which are good.  I have always really liked his perspective on what he defines as "A" projects/activities - it's not always work, work, work.

Like I enjoy hiking and often think of doing a thru-hike on the Appalachian or Pacific Coast trail - but would I really enjoy being out there for SIX months?!? Are they just "ego goals"?  <<<<br><br>This is precisely why I like the well-formed goal idea.  When I did my goal setting exercises, a la Lakein I took a lot of time formulating them.  IOW, after I had the basic list from the exercises, I paid a lot of attention to the six-month list.  (After thinking more about it from our last exchange, it dawned on me that it is precisely the six-month question that brings into focus LONG TERM goals, rather than short.  The question is not do you want to DO in the next six months, but if you ONLY HAD six months, what would be the most IMPORTANT things you could accomplish in those last months?  That is a question of ultimate importance rather than one of immediate gratification.)<br><br>But to continue (squirrel! ;-) once the goal was identified, and fleshed out according to the general principles of well-formedness (specific, time limited, etc.) I wrote several paragraphs describing my outcome.  IOW, I described how it would be to have accomplished it, why I wanted to do it, what I would have gotten from it, etc.  I feel that helps in separating the pie-in-the-sky things from those which are really meaningful.<br><br>It is still possible for crap to get through that filter.  But to do so it would have to be something like: "I want to climb Mt. Everest so my buddies will have their jaws hanging open."  O.K. for the day on which you write the goal, but over time, as you start to plan the milestones and projects and tasks, rereading that REASON for doing the thing kind of brings into focus that maybe I don't REALLY want to climb the mountain, but rather just make others feel incompetent compared to me.  Then I'm more likely to question my motives and overall mental health ;-)<br><br>I am what some here are lately calling a scanner, I guess.  I have gobs of interests and tend to be wider than deep.  Whatever the reasons for that (and I must say that I'm not a big fan of reasons for motivation) I find that I need to be very careful to understand my reasons for doing a project ... the more so if it will take lots of time and effort.  EVERYTHING seems fun to do ... but time is not infinite and not everything will have a high pay back.<br><br>A second thing here is that one of the classical ways we procrastinate is by this whole relative difficulty idea (which AF uses to some advantage).  I am not one to always flee to outright pleasure in order to avoid work ... I'm quite happy to do things that take a LOT of work, so long as it is work that I don't (for my own reasons) despise doing.  The implication here is that just doing something, even something that may have great worth, may not be the best use of my time.  I want to be doing something that has a high pay back and so I spend considerable time prioritizing goals.  Only through prioritizing can I be sure that I am not kidding myself and avoiding doing important things (to which I am resistant) in favor of less important but attractive ones, which nonetheless are still valuable.</div>

Lately I am just as excited about the goals I've decided not to pursue as the goals I'm still working on. <br><br>I don't think everyone is goal-oriented in the same way and even within people, our approach to goals fluctuates. I've achieved goals where I did it the SMART way and goals I've achieved that I approached in a very laid-back way. Right now I have a goal of writing a 50,000 word novel in a month. It's very Lakein-ish. Then I have another goal which is to get better at tennis. I went through a time recently where I considered dropping the goal. The fact that cranky 80yo women were beating me had something to do with that. I'm continuing to move in the general direction of my goal in spite of my humiliation.

On the face of it, lowering standards is a bad thing.  But what it seems to come down to is what the standards are about.  Where we get into big trouble is when we judge ourselves by a too high standard.  As someone put it (someone in the NLP world, to be sure) is that depression often ensues because of unrealistically high standards.

That is why I like using a longer deadline for some things anyway. The methods I'd adopt for a 6-month deadline are too harsh for some things. Like, I'd get rid of one whole season's worth of clothing if I were going in 6 months. LOL<br><br>Love your idea to have "enjoy tennis more" as a goal. I think this is in line with my desire to be patient and positive about it rather than saying, "You look like an idiot"--my usual commentary. <br><br>Alan, I have been working toward lowering my standards for the past several months. One of the biggest areas that has had a huge payoff is in terms of productivity. <br><br>Mike, I think you're right that the Bucket List guys NEEDED their list to keep them going. I am so thankful that I feel I could die today and have no deep regrets. A few little things I would have wished I'd taken care of, but nothing major. No unquenchable desire to visit a country I haven't visited. I'm content. But I do need to scrub my kitchen floor today. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Oh Mel, I agree about the 6 month methods being too harsh even for decluttering.  I like to be environmentally friendly after all.  :-)  But I could still learn to be a bit more decisive.  Now get out that bucket and wash that floor!<br><br>Mel, sometimes I like having my bucket/goal list to rein in myself.  For example, I can and do receive emails from travel places regularly on trips to Vegas, Disneyworld and other places I don't really have any interest in.  Having written down where I do really want to go somewhere reminds me that Vegas isn't on that list.  It's hard to stay mindful of what you really want when faced with temptations from marketers and having it on a list definitely helps.<br><br>Mike, are you thinking about Lyndon Duke and the "linguistics of suicide" where he talks about the "curse of exceptionality?"  Basically, that some suicidal people expect more out of life than life can realistically give.  And expect more out of themselves than they can give too sometimes.<br><br>I think I also recall Carol Dweck in her book Mindset talking about "the curse of the exceptional student" - that one hit home and caused a lot of issues for me in my late 20's and early 30's with that perfectionist mindset.  But that's  another thread.</div>

<div class="content">Mel.<br><br>The "Failure is always an option." seems to fit well with these guys.  They are both special effects (FX) guys ... they have created lots of the monsters you see in the movies as well as robots for ads and exploding this and that.  I can see where having that mindset is very helpful to them.  They never know if something will work or not so they just have to try it and keep on tinkering and in the end, settle for a new approach.  (And, BTW, they are not drunken morons like some of their imitators.  They really can do the math and design the project before they start.  Great show!)<br><br>Jacqueline,<br><br>No, it did not come from those sources.  It was someone in the NLP world, for sure.  Perhaps several.  NLP has modeled what works for people.  IOW, if you want to be a successful student, find a successful (better if you do it with many) and interview them very carefully to discover what they do that works.  Then do that yourself.  (I say carefully because they seldom know the key and much of what they tell you sounds good but is irrelevant.)<br><br>In this particular case they wondered what makes people happy and one of the key points is having a low standard for happiness.  Some people need to crush someone in business to be happy.  Some need to make lots of money.  The people who are MOST happy ... I mean happy PEOPLE, not just people BEING happy ... are those who will be happy for just about any reason.  They are happy to just be alive.  They don't have lots of conditions they need to meet in order to feel happy.  We have all met those people ... truth be told, they often annoy ;-)  But they are just anthropomorphizied sunshine.  My wife is a bit like that.  She has this wonderful smile that, once she is up in the morning (because there is nothing happy about mornings for her ;-) she turns on and it lights the world up.<br><br>Another way to look at it is that some people need a reason to be happy, others need a reason to be sad.<br><br>Speaking of NLP, I am chomping at the bit to finish Ellis so I can get to "The Emotional Hostage" again.  In it they model the components of emotion and I'm looking forward to seeing what they did for procrastination.  IIRC, they did not address processes so much as real emotion so I'm not hopeful in that regard, but since a sense of inadequacy is key to much of procrastination (especially perfectionism) and hostility to another, I'll bet I am able to add to my compilation of ideas from that source.<br><br>Re: Cleaning in six months.  You know, I had a very enlightening experience in that regard.  One day I was driving home from a road trip and rounded the corner just as I was worrying that all was O.K. with the house while I was gone.  In the split second I saw the house (perfectly fine) it dawned on me that I would not be all that brokenhearted if the place burned down (this was before I had furry critters living with me).  The thought of losing everything did not seem so awful after all.  So why did I have so much STUFF?</div>

<div class="content">Happy gobble-gobble day to you Mel,<br><br>I'm doing a last few minutes of gossiping here before I pack up the car for travel back to a (presumably still standing) home ;-)<br><br>>>>  Great stuff, you two. It DOES help me to know what I want so I can filter out everything I don't. I am going to consider a bucket list, but have to decide on a time frame. Even a places-I-want-to-go list would work.  <<<<br><br>The "bucket list" is just one of those pop catch phrases for a list of lifetime goals.  I really REALLY suggest to anyone that doing the exercies in the Lakein book will be life changing.  It will take some days to do it right.  I'd start now and hope to be done my the first of the year.  Yes, if you do it right it takes time.  Not whole gobs of dedicated times, but many sessions of review and tweaking.<br><br>The thing about doing that. Is that you CAN end up with a list of lifetime goals broken down by intermediate milestones.  When I did mine I wound up with:<br><br>- Lifetime<br>- 20 Years<br>- 10 Years<br>-   5 Years<br>-   3 Years<br>-   1 Year<br>-   6 Months<br>-   3 Months<br>-   1 Month<br>-    Weekly<br><br>With that kind of a structure, the long term goals were supported by the shorter term ones and on my weekly reviews I only had to look at my one month list to get it worked out.  Monthly I only needed to look at my 3 months list to keep that in shape.  Periodically I would look at the longer frames and generally tweak things ... but not often.  The longer term goals take care of themselves if you have them fully supported by the short term ones.<br><br>And please note, there is no MUST in any of it.  If you don't feel like working on tasks this week (or for several months) that support some 10 year goal, who cares?  The only thing is that you will at least KNOW what you are doing ... and perhaps decide that your long term goals have changed.<br><br>>>>  A low standard for happiness. That's it. I couldn't figure out why my easy-going, always content girlfriends could be okay with not dusting for example. Or not making five salads for a dinner party when just one would do. I've always felt compelled to do more.  <<<<br><br>Yes.  It is so easy to hear that as a "low PERSONAL standard".  But it is only low as regards to what will make you HAPPY.  A good example was my packing for this trip.  I took several books, my notebook computer, pads of paper, an assortment of pens ... you know how it goes ;-)  I'm at the end of my trip now and have only worked on ONE of the books I brought.  I briefly scanned another.  I have made good notes on the first but not done the mind map I really want.  I have not done a second read yet either.  I've touched nothing else.  BUT ... I am quite content with what I've done.  I am not chewing my nails in angst over my miserable failure as a human being because I have not even looked at the other SIX books I hauled along in the car ;-) ;-)<br><br>"But if you accept such a short fall you'll never get anything done!"  Errr... so what?  I'm not living this life to prove things to people.  I'm getting done what I want to get done as revised by life's events.  What else can any of us do and retain our sanity?  ;-)<br><br>>>>  As for determining what makes a person successful, we're nearly always wrong. Even when we're given the right answer, we tend to dismiss it. Why is Tiger Woods so good at golf? Because he started playing at 2. No, that's not it. It's the clubs. LOL  <<<<br><br>Well, the problem is that there are so many standards for success.  Likely as not Tiger is successful because he started so young and his standard for being a "good person" in the eyes of his father was to excel at golf.  Starting that young probably installed that so deeply in his subconscious that now the basic standard of happiness for him is golf.  Just speculating, of course ... he is not about to reveal that much about himself.<br><br>>>>  Another mental technique I've used for determining what I really need to keep is to imagine that I'm going to live in a small condo for a couple of years. What would I really need? Mike, you wouldn't be sad about losing your pictures and mementos?  <<<<br><br>Well, to start with, remember that I'm an E5w6.  We don't get that much attached to things.  We CAN, in a WAY.  It is hard to describe.  I do have lots of STUFF that I am attached to, but that is only at the surface.  I could walk away from it all and live on an island in the South Pacific with only a stick to draw on the sand with.  I really could, as odd as that might sound to some.  I'd miss my books for a bit, but most of that stuff is in my mind now and I mostly just make new connections among the material I already have in there.  I find that there is very little new under the sun and after all these years, I've seen and heard most of it.<br><br>I'd miss my cats though.  I HAVE to have my cats ;-)</div>

I used to LOVE that stuff. I would spend my vacation filling notebooks with goals using every time frame. Now I can't think of any lifetime goals I have that lend themselves to that framework. For example, I want to raise and educate my kids well.

I've traveled around the world. I've read lots of books. Now I'm working on a goal that wasn't even a burning passion--writing a novel. I do love it and don't know where it will lead, but I could also be okay if it didn't go anywhere. <br><br>There are other things I could pursue, sure. But nothing I feel like I want to approach in a Lakein way. And I don't feel depressed or even unmotivated. I just feel content. See I WAS living to prove things to people. Now I'm not.

<div class="content">I'll throw it out there that Tiger Woods became Tiger Woods in part through Earl Woods being an estie.  I thought this was interesting:<br><br>“What I learned through est was that by doing more for myself, I could do much more for others. Yes, be responsible, but love life, and give people the space to be in your life, and allow yourself room to give to others. That caring and sharing is what’s most important, not being responsible for everyone else. Which is where Tiger comes in. What I learned led me to give so much time to Tiger, and to give him the space to be himself, and not to smother him with dos and don’ts. I took out the authority aspect and turned it into companionship. I made myself vulnerable as a parent. When you have to earn respect from your child, rather than demanding it because it’s owed to you as the father, miracles happen. I realized that, through him, the giving could take a quantum leap. What I could do on a limited scale, he could do on a global scale.”<br><br><a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/features/1996/sportsman/1996.html" rel="nofollow">http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/features/1996/sportsman/1996.html</a></div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline<br><br>I'm always a bit wary about looking at someone who's succeeded in any field and then trying to identify factors in their success in isolation. Unless you look at a wide range of people it's difficult to determine which factors really were determinant.<br><br>For instance, I attended a lecture by a successful businessman who talked about the business gambles he had taken. You might suppose that the message to learn was that one should be prepared to take risks in business. But suppose ten people exactly like him had taken the same risks and for nine the gamble had failed? The one we invite to lecture us will be the one out of the ten who won the gamble. We won't invite the nine who did exactly the same but failed.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-11-28 12:04</div>
<div class="content">Good Morning Mark,<br><br>Yes, exactly.  People who are successful don't really know what it is that they do to be successful.  Like all of us, they just do what seems natural to them.  Some of that causes their success, much of it is just neutral in regard to the particular success they have, and a bit of it works against their success and actually causes them problems.<br><br>In addition, if you take a person with a different personality and have him try to apply even those things which you KNOW (putting aside HOW you know it for a second) are responsible for this person's success, they might well be the ruination of the second person.  Which is to say that you SHOULD invite the nine who failed!<br><br>Beside not knowing what is really responsible for his success, many successful people do not WANT to share ... they see their ability as valuable and don't want to give it away to others.  And they do this (not share) by giving misleading information ... consciously or not.<br><br>The way you get the information, IMO, is to "model" them.  You do this by interviewing many people who have a certain "type" of success.  For example, you might interview many business people.  To be more accurate, you might limit your study sample to only salesperson's and try to isolate what makes THEM successful.  Really, "success in business" is far to broad to model.  Salesmen don't have (or need) exactly the same skills as CEOs.  In addition, real estate sales people share common basic sales skills with "route salesmen" but have skills unique to that kind of selling.  Selling door-to-door is different than selling multi-million dollar items to CEOs.<br><br>To do the interview, one has to develop experience in doing exactly that "type" of interview.  IOW, one has to have an idea of the most general kinds of things that make people "successful" in whatever they do.  (And in this context "success" includes getting results that no one would rationally want ... like psychological disorders.  Success only means "efficiently and reliably getting SOME outcome".)<br><br>So knowing how people produce results "in general" leads you to know what kinds of questions to ask and where to look.  Knowing that, you are able to get a profile of each person and then compare them to each other to find out what is common.  For example, in interviewing one baseball star you get a pile of information including that he always wears the same socks without washing them for the whole season.  (Ewwww!)  No other players do that ... so you throw it out of your list of reasons for success.  But looking very deeply at them you might find that each has something similar ... one might tap his bat on his shoe exactly three times, another might cross himself, another spit, etc.  Now clearly none of those could be responsible for his success, but perhaps having SOME ritual is what is important ... since all of them do it.  In addition, experience in modeling would lead you to notice that quickly and you'd know to ask the right questions to uncover what they are all "feeling" when they are putting on dirty socks or spitting.  You'd have learned that it is not so much what they DO, but what that means to them that has importance.<br><br>If you wanted to be thorough you might interview baseball players who completely sucked at it.  To do it even better you might formulate a theory of "success in baseball" and then, after interviewing successes, then the failures, try training one of the failures according to what you learned from the successful ones and see if you could cause improvement.  Basically it is a science project.  The problem with success literature is that it is all allegorical.  The successful ones write books about themselves which make them important (and make them money) and they don't really know or care what made them successful.</div>

We know that we will get what we want if we really want it but otherwise we don't want things just to have things.  We are going to get a sound system this year.  It is not a burning desire, but her life is music and she should have the highest quality music that is financially reasonable.

<div class="content">Mel,<br><br>Oh, one more thing ...when I recommend Lakein for goal setting, I have in mind someone who has never set goals before.  Like you, I have done all of that and I'm now in maintenance mode.  Were I to get "the bad news" next week, I'd not go out and buy gear for some new project ... I'd know what to drop and what to spend the rest of my short and valuable time on.<br><br>You and I (and some others) are in a different boat than others who are struggling with finding themselves.<br><br>For example, I was looking for a better task management system because I was losing time.  I knew that because I was monitoring goals and knew things were taking longer than they should.  I knew that because I HAD goals.  I knew AF would work (as soon as I read about it) because I've done task management any number of ways over the years so I have a well developed intuition in that regard.  I knew I had problems with AF the same way.

<div class="content">Mike, I agree. I love the Margaritaville analogy. LOL! That's absolutely where I am. Can't wait to go to Mexico in January and try out my new Spanish speaking skills. The kids and I have been learning together using Visual Link Spanish at a nice steady clip. I've found that for my personality I can learn better with others. Actually, I learn most things best by teaching them.<br><br>If you had children, I suspect you would have homeschooled them. It's really the most fulfilling experience. It's an adventure in discovery. Just like TM systems, you can have high hopes that a curriculum will be "the answer" and then your kids say, "We hate it." lol What's fantastic about those moments is that you usually hate it, too. My oldest was asking why he had to keep using the art curriculum when he doesn't like it and doesn't plan to do anything with it in the future. I found myself saying, "Because I had to do it." He didn't even have to say anything before I realized that I needed to let him scrap it.<br><br>Now to Mark's point. My second son has a natural giftedness in art and also a naturally unmotivated personality. I asked him what he would like to do when he grows up and he said, "Whatever they want me to do." LOL! So I have had to insist that he continue with the art curriculum. He'll be glad later. Deciding when to push and when to drop these kinds of things is tough. I also don't think we should put the responsibility on our parents though. Sorry Mark! If something is a driving passion, even if you are just a child, you will beg your parents for the opportunity. Otherwise parents will let you go your own way.<br><br>Mike, a sound system sounds like a great gift. Dh and I don't exchange gifts either. I love gifts, but I got tired of my dh's habit of giving me torn pieces of yellow notebook paper on Christmas morning saying, "You can buy X." LOL!! Gotta love him. He lets me buy things I really want throughout the year, so it's not right for me to complain. I decided to beg the kids for the one thing I really want anyway (a Wii fitness game). I love your suggestion that a gift of doing is better. Almost everything I'm getting for the kids this year falls in that category. I'm getting lazer tag guns for everyone. The family that shoots at one another stays together, right? ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline,<br><br>>>>  Mike - I wonder if it's symbolic that the squirrel got fried? :-)  <<<<br><br>ROTFLMAO ;-)  I can only hope ;-)<br><br>>>>  As always, if I wait long enough you will say what I'm thinking better than I. It sounds like you've been reading Emotional Hostage. What are you doing method-wise w.r.t. procrastination?  <<<<br><br>I've not gotten back to it since the last time.  I've not even unpacked yet ;-)  The thing about "Emotional Hostage" is that it is not something you "read".  It is really more of a workbook, even if not laid out that way.  In my first read through I set up the different emotions and the various components they suggest make them up.  I tried them out and confirmed that it made sense to me.  Then I saw one of those damn squerrils.  LOL ;-)<br><br>On my next go around, I'll pick up where I left off and tackle the emotions I believe underlie procrastination.  Particularly "overwhelm", "frustration", "depression", and those kinds of things.  I'll let you know what I learn.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>Speaking from painful experience, you can NOT "force" a child to learn a musical instrument.  I'll have to ask her when she wakes up but I think my wife will confirm that as well.</div>

<div class="content">Mel,<br><br>How the hell are you?  ;-)<br><br>>>>   Mike, I agree. I love the Margaritaville analogy. LOL! That's absolutely where I am. Can't wait to go to Mexico in January and try out my new Spanish speaking skills. The kids and I have been learning together using Visual Link Spanish at a nice steady clip. I've found that for my personality I can learn better with others. Actually, I learn most things best by teaching them.  <<<<br><br>I'm with you there.  In fact, sometimes when I get stuck on something, I imagine that I'm explaining it to someone and that often breaks the mental logjam for me.<br><br>As to Spanish, I found that listening to a Spanish radio station all day helped "work it in".  There is also a wonderful TV series, called "Destinos".  It is a great way to learn the language.  It is done as a Spanish soap.  A woman attorney is asked to help a dying man find a lover he lost many years ago.  In the process, she travels to all of the various Spanish speaking countries and doing that she travels in many ways (thus discussing the words for train, boat, plane, suit case, clothing, money, etc.)  It is very well done.  It is one of those PBS things.  Of course, if you are going in January, I'd just play the radio and TV in Spanish until you go ;-)<br><br>>>>  If you had children, I suspect you would have homeschooled them.  <<<<br><br>Every time I hear a news item about a teacher mollesting a child, or worse ... the kinds of idiotic politically correct crap they pass off as education ... I say just that thing.<br><br>>>>  It's really the most fulfilling experience.  It's an adventure in discovery. <<<<br><br>I can imagine.  I can also imagine how much you learn about the world through new eyes.<br><br>>>>  Just like TM systems, you can have high hopes that a curriculum will be "the answer" and then your kids say, "We hate it." lol What's fantastic about those moments is that you usually hate it, too. My oldest was asking why he had to keep using the art curriculum when he doesn't like it and doesn't plan to do anything with it in the future. I found myself saying, "Because I had to do it." He didn't even have to say anything before I realized that I needed to let him scrap it.  <<<<br><br>LOL ;-)  That IS neat.<br><br>>>>  Now to Mark's point. My second son has a natural giftedness in art and also a naturally unmotivated personality. I asked him what he would like to do when he grows up and he said, "Whatever they want me to do." LOL! So I have had to insist that he continue with the art curriculum. He'll be glad later. <<<<br><br>Despite what I said to Mark just now, I agree.  The real trick is to find a way to motive without force.  Without giving it much thought, I'd try to find ways to tie it to something he values.  I mean, how neat would it be to be able to draw pictures of the girl he wants to impress?  How much fun would it be to keep a sketch journal of walks in the woods as the season's change?  If he is interested in cars, he could sketch the ones he likes and then start to sketch new fantastic designs.  How much easier to learn if he could illustrate points with quick sketches (a la mind maps)?<br><br><<<  Deciding when to push and when to drop these kinds of things is tough. I also don't think we should put the responsibility on our parents though. Sorry Mark! If something is a driving passion, even if you are just a child, you will beg your parents for the opportunity. Otherwise parents will let you go your own way.  <<<<br><br>Yeah, that is a fine line.  A kid needs some minimal exposure to find his driving passion.  He does stand the best chance if home schooled, however.  I remember seeing a thing on 60 Minutes, I think it was, about five farm boys in Montana or someplace and they were all students at Julliard at the top of the heap at a young age playing concerts. <br><br>>>>  Mike, a sound system sounds like a great gift. Dh and I don't exchange gifts either. I love gifts, but I got tired of my dh's habit of giving me torn pieces of yellow notebook paper on Christmas morning saying, "You can buy X." LOL!! Gotta love him.  <<<<br><br>Men!  ROTF ;-)  The trouble is that you get to know someone and, as you say below, you get stuff throughout the year.  I mean, if my wife can use it today, I'm not going to wait until an official holiday ... why the hell should she wait?<br><br>>>>  He lets me buy things I really want throughout the year, so it's not right for me to complain. I decided to beg the kids for the one thing I really want anyway (a Wii fitness game).  <<<<br><br>Have you a Wii system now?  Do you enjoy it?  Have you done any comparisons with X- Box or PlayStation?<br><br>>>>  I love your suggestion that a gift of doing is better. Almost everything I'm getting for the kids this year falls in that category. I'm getting lazer tag guns for everyone. The family that shoots at one another stays together, right? ;-)  <<<<br><br>ROTFLMAO ;-)  I'm going to remember that one ;-)</div>
