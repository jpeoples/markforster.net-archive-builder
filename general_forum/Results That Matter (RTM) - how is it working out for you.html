<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2023-11-8 23:48</div>
<div class="content">Several people have begun posting feedback and results on their RTM usage. I thought I'd start a separate thread for any additional updates people might have.<br><br>Main RTM post - <a href="../general_forum/Results That Matter (RTM).html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2795362</a><br><br>For myself, it keeps getting better and better, more focus and more momentum, despite ongoing health issues. I've been knocking out several backlogs and preventing them from re-appearing.<br><br>Keeping the unfinished projects in order of creation, and always reviewing them in that order, really helps with the "attenuation" dynamic. I might skip over some of these projects for several days but then I finally just feel like "OK I just have to get this done now!" and bang!  I get it done.  It always feels so good to get those things off my list.<br><br>I've also been experimenting with different formats:<br>-- At work, I've standardized on Asana, since that is what everyone uses where I work. It's been great. <br>-- For personal, I started with a Moleskine notebook that I split into three sections using "Post-it Durable Tabs". That worked fine. I especially liked to flip through the completed stuff in the Unfinished section -- the things that finally got done. It gave me a real sense of progress and accomplishment to see how much stuff I was getting done.<br>-- Then I switched to a Planner Pad, just to try a different format ( https://plannerpads.com/why-it-works ).  I tried it for a couple weeks, and it also worked fine.  I entered New tasks into the long lined page at the beginning of each month; Unfinished tasks into the next available column at the top of each page; and Recurring tasks onto the dated middle group of lines. This all seemed to work fine. I liked using the dated sections for Recurring -- it worked a little better than just a straight undated simple list. <br>-- Then I switched to OneNote. There are lots of ways you could set up Unfinished, New, and Recurring there. It is working especially well for me.<br><br>All of these have worked really well. Personally I like OneNote the best, and will probably stick with it. But it's nice to know RTM is simple enough that it can be implemented in any of these formats and apps.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for starting this thread, Seraphim, and thanks especially for developing RTM.<br><br>As I mention in the earlier thread I have been using RTM to feed a daily timeblock schedule. Here is how I do it:<br><br>Day 1 using the system: <br><br>All new tasks go into Microsoft Todo. Then I build a timeblock schedule, reviewing the tasks and adding the ones I want to do today to the "My Day" in Todo. I transfer those tasks to a paper schedule. And I follow it as best as I can. <br><br>Note: I think people feel that a timeblock schedule must be followed with strict fidelity, not for me, I use it to gauge what I should do that day and about how much time I would like to spend on it. I also like to put high value tasks in the beginning of the day and lower value tasks later in the day). If I get some of my timeblock schedule done in a day I feel good :) <br><br>If I finish a task and I want to do it regularly, I add a repeat to it (daily, weekly, etc) and move it to the recurring folder in Todo). If I start a task but do not finish it, I move it to the unfinished folder in toto and add a link to a OneNote page dedicated to that task. <br><br>Day 2(and beyond) I build my timeblock schedule by reviewing the unfinished tasks I want/need to work on, then the recurring, then any new tasks, I make a timeblock schedule out of that, and get things done.<br><br>If anyone is interested in knowing more about how to timeblock with RTM (or interested in Microsoft Todo which is a powerful, but quirky) free app that works on phone and desktop I am happy to share more.</div>

<div class="content">For Recurring in RTM I have substituted my calendar: appointments, and repeated tasks are all roughly scheduled.  In place of a physical or digital calendar system I use a manual algorithm in my outliner to accomplish the same function.  All tasks are in rough chronological order, and only today's tasks are visible until it's time to extract the things to be done tomorrow.<br><br>So top-level view, my RTM has 3 parts on a single page:<br>- Today's routine tasks, including one-off events that are today-only.<br>- All  (active) unfinished projects (each with a defined short-term goal, and linked to details)<br>- New (inbox) tasks, which can each be either dropped, worked on, or filed.<br><br>Respecting time blocking I have the same sentiment as jones (are you no longer veggie, or is that a typo?).  Today's routine tasks establish the frame, and I mentally consider where I can fit in project work and new work to get rough blocks.  If a project becomes a priority, I will promote it to my calendar for regular attention, but otherwise I will tackle whatever stands out when I have time to address things.<br><br>Prior to RTM, I was doing a rough time block of all the day's tasks, so limiting this to only routine items is a departure.</div>

<div class="content"><<Keeping the unfinished projects in order of creation, and always reviewing them in that order, really helps with the "attenuation" dynamic.>><br><br>I'm finding this negatively affects me, so I'm shifting to moving projects to the end.  Then whatever's at the top is being neglected.</div>

<div class="content">After 3 weeks, I have also good luck with the RTM. <br><br>I am going old school and using composition style notebook to make sure the kinks are worked out before automating it using a Mac friendly tool stack (Things vs. TickTick + Upnote)<br><br>My favorite feature is the ability to go and hack away at the Unfinished queue. <br><br>The area I am still struggling is how to prioritize urgent/new things over recurring/unfinished at the start of the day. <br><br>Thanks again for this great innovation, @Seraphim.</div>

<div class="content">vegheadjones - <br><br><< I have been using RTM to feed a daily timeblock schedule >><br><br>Interesting approach!<br><br>At work we have a "daily huddle" where we tell everyone what we are planning to do that day (high level). So I end up doing something similar to you. First I scan for any meetings, then I scan my unfinished items and jot down 1-2 things I think I will focus on. Then I scan New and Recurring for anything that may take up a chunk of the day, and also add those. <br><br>Then I forget about it and just work my list as normal. But it is helpful to do this quick review -- it gives a sense of how much time I have in the day to get things done, and where to focus.<br><br>How do you actually build out the timeblock schedule? Do you do it on paper? electronically? within ToDo?</div>

<div class="content">Alan Baljeu - <br><br><< For Recurring in RTM I have substituted my calendar: appointments, and repeated tasks are all roughly scheduled. >><br><br>Many of my recurring items also end up as recurring appointments or reminders in Outlook, especially if I want to do them at a specific time or on a specific day.

It always gives me a sense of accomplishment. I feel like I am focusing more and more on the most important work.<br><br><br><< The area I am still struggling is how to prioritize urgent/new things over recurring/unfinished at the start of the day. >><br><br>The system is designed to help resolve this conflict, by starting with the Unfinished. This ensures you always have a good awareness of your overall load of work-in-progress. This awareness helps keep your whole workload intuitive and manageable. And this in turn allows you to keep up with all the urgent and recurring things, and to keep them in the proper perspective.<br><br>Urgent things are often illusions. They can seem urgent, and we acquiesce to the sense of urgency, because it is a welcome distraction from the frustration and drudgery of dealing with constant overwhelm. And it seems like we are doing something important -- when in fact it can be causing us to get further and further behind on the *more* important things that will really move our work forward.<br><br>In contrast, if we are focused on the Unfinished, and maintain a good sense of our overall workload, direction, and momentum, then it's much easier to assess intuitively the real urgency of new incoming demands. <br><br>Likewise, it often seems really important to keep "inbox zero" and keep all our recurring systems completely up-to-date.  But this can end up being a distraction -- just empty busy-work.  I think we are drawn to these relatively easy tasks, because we are stuck or overwhelmed with the larger, unfinished tasks.  And so clearing our inbox or updating the KPIs or reading the weekly report or tidying up the office become displacement activities and do not serve their real purpose -- which is to support our overall goals and purposes, not as ends in themselves.  So focusing on Unfinished first, helps keep all this in the right perspective.  Recurring tasks are the systems and routines that help us stay focused on the larger things that really matter to us, that need our focused attention and effort. <br><br>I'm not sure if any of this addresses your own conflict between new/urgent and recurring/unfinished, but hopefully it gives you some ideas.</div>

<div class="content">I greatly appreciate the thought you’ve put into this, Seraphim. I’ve implemented this system in Apple Notes. It has changed the way I look at work; I love the stabilizing force of the single page (note) for the unfinished work. It lets me feel that I can instantly resume work on it the next time I’m ready. By putting the unfinished work at the top of the morning, I’m able to get back into what’s important without getting lost in less important but seemingly urgent items. Thank you.</div>

<div class="content">I did some compiling of Seraphim's fantastic work. I extracted his posts from about 5 different pages related to the RTM method, and got Claude to show the evolution.  Thank you Seraphim, I am loving the system so far, and was coming back to find some cures for resistance (and ways to procrastinate I guess.....)<br><br><br># 1 Evolution of RTM by Seraphim<br># 2 Results That Matter Time Management System<br><br>## 2.1 Evolution of RTM<br><br>### 2.1.1 Origins and Influences<br><br>Seraphim's "Results That Matter" (RTM) system evolved gradually through experimentation with various time management approaches, primarily building on Mark Forster's systems. The journey began with Serial No-List and moved through several iterations of AutoFocus 4 (AF4), eventually crystallizing into what Seraphim initially called "AF4RS" (AF4 Revised, Seraphim's version) before renaming it to "Results That Matter."<br><br>The system draws from several theoretical frameworks:<br><br>1. Theory of Constraints (TOC) with its focus on security versus satisfaction<br>2. Jordan Peterson's interpretation of order versus chaos<br>3. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's concept of "Flow"<br>4. The balance between skill and challenge<br><br>Seraphim noticed recurring patterns across these frameworks, recognizing that meaningful productivity happens at the intersection of order and chaos, security and satisfaction, skill and challenge. His system attempts to bridge these dualities through practical implementation.<br><br>### 2.1.2 The Path to RTM<br><br>The evolution happened through several key iterations:<br><br>1. **Serial No-List with Tomorrow Component** (2019) - Adding a "Tomorrow" page to capture recurring items and task requests, creating a separation between maintenance tasks and creative work.<br>    <br>2. **AF4R Revised Order** (2022) - Reordering the AF4 page types to prioritize unfinished work first, followed by new tasks, recurring tasks, and old tasks. This addressed the problem of excessive list growth and resistance to the system.<br>    <br>3. **AF4RS** (2023) - Further refinements to regulate total load of commitments and work-in-progress (WIP), making current workload highly visible and helping to optimize flow.<br>    <br>4. **Results That Matter** (2023) - The finalized system with a clean three-section approach that focuses on regulating workload, providing clarity, and delivering meaningful results.<br>    <br><br>## 2.2 RTM System Overview<br><br>### 2.2.1 Core Components<br><br>RTM consists of three main sections:<br><br>1. **New Tasks** - Captures tasks that are on your mind or that arise during work<br>2. **Recurring Tasks** - Regular maintenance activities that keep your life in order<br>3. **Unfinished Tasks** - Tasks that you've started but haven't completed yet<br><br>The key innovation is giving each unfinished task its own page, making works-in-progress highly visible and naturally limiting how many projects you take on simultaneously.<br><br>### 2.2.2 Basic Rules<br><br>1. Split your notebook into three approximately equal sections (New, Recurring, Unfinished)<br>2. Begin by writing 10-20 tasks on your mind in the New Tasks section<br>3. Cycle through each section, working on whatever feels ready to be worked on<br>4. When you finish a task, cross it off. If it's recurring, re-enter it on the Recurring list<br>5. If you start but don't finish a task, move it to the Unfinished section and give it a whole page<br>6. Cycle through the sections in this order: Unfinished → New → Recurring → back to Unfinished<br>7. When starting each day, begin with the Unfinished Tasks section<br><br>### 2.2.3 The Importance of Each Section<br><br>**New Tasks** serves as:<br><br>- A capture system for urgent items<br>- A seedbed for new ideas and projects<br>- A diagnostic tool to see what's currently capturing your attention<br><br>**Recurring Tasks** functions as:<br><br>- A maintenance system for routine activities<br>- A way to keep your life in basic order<br>- A diagnostic tool to identify systems that need improvement<br><br>**Unfinished Tasks** works as:<br><br>- A focus tool for meaningful project work<br>- A visual representation of your current commitments<br>- A natural limiter for work-in-progress (WIP)<br><br>## 2.3 Why RTM Works<br><br>### 2.3.1 Natural WIP Limitation<br><br>RTM naturally restricts the number of tasks you engage with simultaneously without imposing arbitrary limits. By maintaining unfinished tasks on their own pages in a dedicated section, the system creates:<br><br>1. High visibility of current commitments<br>2. Clear awareness of how long you've been "spinning each plate"<br>3. Natural resistance to starting new projects when already overloaded<br>4. Momentum toward finishing what you've started<br><br>As Seraphim notes: "The unfinished tasks are generally a combination of a few important initiatives that are going to take me several days or even a week or two to finish, combined with other medium-sized tasks that will get done within a day or two."<br><br>### 2.3.2 Optimization of Flow<br><br>The system encourages flow states by:<br><br>1. Balancing skill and challenge through task selection<br>2. Providing freedom to follow intuition while maintaining structure<br>3. Making resistance patterns visible so they can be addressed<br>4. Creating momentum through frequent completions<br><br>By starting each day with Unfinished Tasks, you immediately engage with meaningful work rather than getting caught in the trap of small administrative tasks.<br><br>### 2.3.3 Integration of Different Task Types<br><br>RTM acknowledges the reality that we have different types of work that demand different approaches:<br><br>1. Project work that requires focus and progression (Unfinished)<br>2. New demands that require responsiveness (New)<br>3. Systems maintenance that requires reliability (Recurring)<br><br>By separating these task types while maintaining a unified system, RTM creates the right context for each type of work while keeping everything visible.<br><br>## 2.4 Implementation Tips<br><br>### 2.4.1 Physical Implementation<br><br>RTM can be implemented in various formats:<br><br>1. **Paper notebook** - Split into three sections using dividers or tabs<br>2. **Digital tools** - OneNote, Asana, or other task management systems<br>3. **Planner formats** - Can adapt to dated planning systems<br><br>Seraphim recommends starting with a simple notebook before migrating to digital systems, to ensure you understand the system dynamics.<br><br>### 2.4.2 Daily Workflow<br><br>Optimal daily workflow:<br><br>1. Start with the Unfinished section to build momentum on important projects<br>2. Move to New tasks after good progress on Unfinished work<br>3. Handle Recurring tasks, ideally completing all daily items<br>4. Return to Unfinished to maintain focus on important work<br>5. Cycle through as needed throughout the day<br><br>### 2.4.3 Handling Recurring Tasks<br><br>For recurring tasks:<br><br>1. Draw a horizontal line after the last task on the recurring list at the beginning of each day<br>2. Re-enter completed recurring tasks below this line<br>3. This gives a visual indication of which daily tasks you've already handled<br><br>For weekly tasks, enter them a page or two forward in the list and ignore them until they are absorbed into the regular list as the list expands forward.<br><br>## 2.5 Handling Common Issues<br><br>### 2.5.1 Large Tasks and Resistance<br><br>When a large task gets stuck or generates resistance:<br><br>1. Timebox the task (15-30 minutes)<br>2. Focus exclusively during that timeframe<br>3. Stop when the timer ends and move to something else<br>4. Return to it in the next cycle through Unfinished tasks<br><br>This approach maintains flow in the system while still making progress on challenging tasks.<br><br>### 2.5.2 List Overflow and Refactoring<br><br>When lists become unwieldy:<br><br>1. Create a "Refactor the New List" task when the New list gets too long or stale<br>2. Add a "Refactor Recurring" task when recurring tasks generate resistance<br>3. Consider creating specialized sub-systems for certain categories (e.g., reading material)<br><br>Seraphim shares an example: "I was putting work-related books and articles onto my New list... But they were becoming too numerous and cluttering up the list. When I did my 'Refactor the New List' task, it became clear I needed a different way of handling the reading material." This led to a separate reading list system.<br><br>### 2.5.3 Task Classification Dilemmas<br><br>When unclear whether a task belongs in Recurring or Unfinished:<br><br>1. Start everything as a New task<br>2. Only after working on it, decide where it belongs<br>3. If it needs to be repeated indefinitely, place it in Recurring<br>4. If it has a definite endpoint but isn't finished yet, place it in Unfinished<br><br>If you placed something in Unfinished but later realize it's better as a recurring routine, refactor it accordingly.<br><br>### 2.5.4 Spinoff Tasks<br><br>When completing a task generates follow-up work:<br><br>1. Add these as New tasks rather than directly to Unfinished<br>2. This helps maintain focus on completing current Unfinished tasks<br>3. The new tasks will be activated when appropriate<br><br>## 2.6 Philosophical Foundations<br><br>### 2.6.1 Balance of Order and Chaos<br><br>RTM embodies the principle that meaning emerges at the intersection of order and chaos:<br><br>1. **Recurring tasks** represent order, stability, and predictability<br>2. **New tasks** represent emerging chaos, unpredictability, and novelty<br>3. **Unfinished tasks** represent the place where you're actively creating meaning by bringing order to chaos<br><br>By maintaining all three perspectives, the system helps you navigate the fundamental tensions of productivity.<br><br>### 2.6.2 Integration of Different Time Horizons<br><br>The system naturally creates a rhythm between:<br><br>1. Short-term responsiveness (New)<br>2. Medium-term projects (Unfinished)<br>3. Long-term systems maintenance (Recurring)<br><br>This helps integrate different time horizons without explicit planning.<br><br>### 2.6.3 Creativity Within Constraints<br><br>RTM demonstrates how boundaries can enhance creativity rather than stifle it. By limiting work-in-progress through the dedicated Unfinished section, the system focuses creative energy on fewer projects, increasing both quality and completion rates.<br><br>As Seraphim notes: "I'm still open to new ideas, but much more selective about them. I find myself automatically evaluating new ideas and new opportunities within the context of everything I already have on my plate. Perhaps surprisingly, I think it's actually improving my creativity."<br><br>## 2.7 Conclusion<br><br>The Results That Matter system has evolved through practical experience to address common challenges in time management:<br><br>1. Balancing responsiveness with deep focus<br>2. Preventing overwhelm without artificial constraints<br>3. Maintaining systems while making meaningful progress<br>4. Creating natural flow between different types of work<br><br>Its simplicity makes it adaptable to various tools and contexts, while its depth addresses fundamental productivity tensions. The focus on maintaining awareness of unfinished commitments helps naturally optimize workload, leading to greater focus, momentum, and meaningful results.<br><br>As Seraphim summarizes: "It naturally restricts the number of tasks. This happens automatically, without any conscious effort. The system keeps me aware of my total current workload and total current backlog of tasks waiting to be started. The system causes me to consider any new ideas that come along within that context."</div>

<div class="content">John W,<br><br>Thanks for this post. At first I thought Claude was a person on the forum, but the post was so thorough that I am sure that I would have heard of Claude by now.<br><br>I use a composition notebook of 200 pages. I am just starting a new notebook for the month of May, so I am thinking today on the first of the month how to organize the notebook. I have tried different ways to handle the new, unfinished, and recurring items. Last month, I started putting the early morning routine items together, and end-of-day routines on its own pages - on a checklist. This saves space, and time in crossing out and rewriting each item, and keeps the items together, which makes it more likely to be done at the same session. I have weekly pages where I put my weekly recurring items. If it is recurring monthly, I put it on next month's calendar, which I keep in the last page of the notebook.<br><br>I have tried putting new items at the end of the notebook going backwards, and also at the bottom of each page with the unfinished tasks above it.<br><br>I have previously tried putting the projects in a separate notebook, with each project having its own page, but eventually I was neglecting to look at another notebook, so I will try to put them in the same notebook as the rest of the items for this month.<br><br>Right now, I am planning on putting the routine items at the beginning, followed by the unfinished pages, and the new items in the back of the notebook, working backwards.<br><br>In the past, I have had difficulty determining what is new, unfinished, and recurring as in AF4R - also mixing up the pages gets confusing the more pages one is dealing with. Autofocus puts all of these on one list, but the list gets very long, and the maintenance takes time.<br><br>So, I am going to put them on different lists, and partition my notebook.</div>

<div class="meta">2025-05-1 18:24</div>
<div class="content">OK, I have set up my May notebook, and started working in it.  However, it doesn't have much semblance to Autofocus - I suppose it is more like a bullet journal. <br><br>Also, there still is maintenance required.  I have an index of the pages in the front, and I have to remember to look at the pages, unlike an Autofocus-like system where the pages might be contiguous, and there are more pages already with projects. <br><br>However, having checklists reduces the number of pages, so that there is more room for a page for each project/unfinished task/collections as in a bullet journal.  I am hoping that I can see the progress working down a single page vertically, rather than working horizontally over several pages like an Autofocus system.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark H,<br><br>I am only new to the system myself, though I do have TOO much experience with various systems, and their pitfalls.  Seraphim's system resonates with me so far. <br><br>That to say that I am probably not the best one to ask for specifics about the system, but here are a few things I do.  <br><br>First, I am trying not to alter the system too much to begin with.  So I have a single notebook (I use an A4 grid book)<br><br>I have coloured masking tape folded over itself and stuck to the beginning page of the 3 sections.  I didn't overthink it so the colours are all the same.  I might add another longer one just to use as a bookmark, as right now, the only resistance I sometimes get is I do feel like a brand new page like in a no list system can be useful, so being able to just open straight to that could be useful.  Also, flipping between the sections can be annoying, mainly when I just want to jot down a new task.  I am a long time GTDer so I can use other systems for this, but eventually it has to go on the new list anyway, and so I would rather have a one piece flow approach rather than batch processing my inbox. But the page flipping creates resistance, because my new list marker is on the first page, so I always have to flip a bunch to find my current page.  <br><br>I don't have separate notebooks for each month.  But I have only been using the system since 19 April 2025. <br><br>On the side, I am also tracking info in obsidian as well as file folders in windows.  These contain files and links and project support material that I wouldn't bother to write in the notepad.  <br><br>For the straight notepad stuff, I guess the only thing I am doing differently (even though I do try to contain myself) is that in my notepad, I have a column on the right where I enter the date I cross off an item.  <br><br>In obsidian, I use numbered lists.  I put the date on level 1, and then I enter new tasks on level 2 under that date heading.  This helps with the FIFO approach, and generally stops me over complicating things and trying to refactor unnecessarily.<br><br>I recently had a project that turned out to be a larger project than I thought, and was getting messy.  It was basically creating spin-off tasks.  I would add those to the project to do list, but create a new unfinished project for them, because I did the same thing as I would from the new list.  I started the sub-project, but didn't finish, which means, it is a project in its own right.  <br><br>Anyway, just musings and thoughts at the moment.    I'm happy to get other tips and ideas from everyone too.  <br><br>Also another useful tip, is that I use the elvenlabs reader on my phone, to read all of Seraphim's posts, which I can do on a walk or something.  It often contains extra little bits and pieces on the re-listen.  <br><br>Thanks all!</div>

<div class="content">John W.,<br><br>Thanks for your reply to me.<br>I read all of your post.<br>I am on the third day. The difference is I am giving a project, or activity that I want to track, its own page. I am keeping a table of contents in the front of the notebook where I write the project name by the page number. <br><br>However, there is no similarity to Autofocus now, or a long list, so I might feel adrift after a while.<br>The checklists for routine items also have separate pages, so all the progress from day to day is on separate pages.</div>

<div class="content">This kind of format where a project has its own page, and I am assuming there is no list of next actions, works well if one's work is by project, so one is working on a project at a time. <br>Autofocus, and long lists mix tasks, next actions, projects, routines together.</div>

<div class="content">I am so pleased that some of you have found RTM useful -- always great to hear.<br><br>I used RTM for about a year, but then started to miss the daily cadence and feel of completion that DIT provides.  So I started experimenting again.  <br><br>My current system blends RTM’s key elements of WIP management and “Recurring Tasks = Factory Operations" approach, with a DIT-style cadence. I run it in Asana now, which makes it easier to structure recurring work as the backbone of the day. Since the recurring work is handled like this, it helps me carve out significant blocks of time for deeper focus work. <br><br>It works beautifully in my day job -- defines the work for each day, so that I have a good sense of what "DONE" feels like.  And it helps me stay on top of all the recurring tasks while making good progress on project work and more impactful tasks. <br><br>But I’m still figuring out how to adapt it to my personal work, which is far more chaotic -- fragmented time, no stable weekly structure, and lots of high-stakes exploratory work. That’s what I am exploring now -- how to preserve flow and focus despite high variability.</div>

<div class="content">...and here I was thinking I'd stumbled across the "Holy Grail" of to-do list systems!!  ;P<br><br>I look forward to hearing about the evolution.  <br><br>I think I looked at DIT many moons ago when I first discovered Mark Forster's work in about 2018, but I don't remember how it works, as I tended to work with FVP style lists.    <br><br>I do know that for some reason, I know that as I soon as I schedule something, I will avoid doing it at all costs!  This is an exaggeration, but the sentiment is very real.     <br><br>It is somewhat similar to the feeling of being tied to an existing long list, instead of having a new list to work from.  I just can't help but think that doing something else at the time, is a better idea...  One of those things I am learning to accept is not that easy to overcome with self discipline, though I go in cycles of success and failure on this front.  <br><br>On that note, I am finding that alongside my RTM notebook, I will sometimes have another notebook, that I just use for notes, like a paper "capture" book using the GTD terminology. <br><br>I will use this as a no-list startup when I am feeling resistance to the RTM book.  For example, I had a weekend getaway to visit relatives, with birthdays and the like to Brisbane, which is about 1.5 hour of driving, so had list items like, buy presents, wrap presents, remember to pick up items that were left behind from last time, buy wrapping paper, remember to bring my watch charger, remember swimming goggles for my daughter etc.  <br><br>It just didn't fit neatly into my standard RTM lists since it was fairly unrelated.  Though I can clear my notes and add them later if needed for unfinished, recurring, checklists etc.  <br><br>Right now, I am in the phase of getting caught up an unfinished work project, and my recurring lists are falling behind, which is leading me to breaking down my unfinished projects into smaller bite sized pieces.  <br><br>So anyway, once again, thank you for the awesome system!  Thank you again to Mark Forster as well.  What a legend and pioneer in having such a willingness to experiment with so many variations.</div>

<div class="content">I'm about to implement a habit tracking system as a new section, that can be used for good habits, or breaking bad ones.  Similar to the unfinished tasks section really.  I'm using the 21 days as a starting point, and setting it to be how long it takes to get 21 days completed, rather than a 21 day challenge.  The idea being to add focus on FIFO habit building, instead of starting and stopping/abandoning.  <br><br># RTM Habit System: Rules and Example Template<br><br>## 1 Core Rules<br><br>1. Add a fourth section to your RTM notebook labeled "Habits"<br>2. Each habit gets its own dedicated page<br>3. Track a cumulative total of 21 successful days for each habit<br>4. Days do not need to be consecutive<br>5. Complete the habit when you reach 21 total successful days<br>6. Review the Habit section daily as part of your regular RTM cycle<br>7. For completed habits, create a maintenance entry in your Recurring Tasks<br><br>## 2 Habit Page Template (Example)<br><br>```<br>HABIT: Break excessive social media scrolling<br><br>TRIGGERS:<br>- Boredom/low stimulation periods<br>- Work transitions/breaks<br>- Bedtime procrastination (9-11pm)<br>- Social avoidance during gatherings<br>- Notifications/alerts<br><br>REPLACEMENT BEHAVIORS:<br>- 2-minute breathing exercise<br>- Quick stretching sequence<br>- Glass of water + brief walk<br>- Brief journaling (3 sentences)<br>- Environment engagement (notice 5 new details)<br><br>TRACKING GRID:<br>□ □ □ □ □ □ □ <br>□ □ □ □ □ □ □<br>□ □ □ □ □ □ □<br><br>PATTERN OBSERVATIONS:<br>- Evening is most challenging time<br>- Physical replacements more effective than mental ones<br>- Success correlates with sleep quality previous night<br>- Social settings create strongest urges<br>- Environmental modification most reliable strategy<br><br>COMPLETION:<br>Start Date: [Date]<br>Completion Date: [Date]<br>Total Days to Accumulate 21: [Number]<br>Next Steps: Monthly check-in added to Recurring Tasks<br>```</div>
