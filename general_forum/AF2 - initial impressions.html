<div class="meta">2009-06-27 21:24</div>
<div class="content">Thanks Mark for sharing all your creativity and insights with us!<br><br>I'm going to give it a try as written, but I do have some reservations:<br><br>- I have lots of active pages -- probably "too many".  I really don't have time to read through the whole list every day.  Not sure I'll be able to follow that rule.  If I tried, I'd probably begin resisting using the AF book at all.  At 1 second per task it'd take about 15-20 minutes.  I think I'd need to get that down to ~5 minutes to make it work.<br><br>- If I can't read through the list every day, then the older pages won't get the periodic review that they do now as I cycle through the list with AF1.  With AF2, those older tasks would drop out of my consciousness altogether, until the daily dismissal of oldest group of active tasks finally catches up to them.  But since I haven't even seen those tasks in quite a while, the "little and often" and "frequent exposure" of AF1 is replaced by "URGENT, do it now, OR ELSE!" as soon as the new dismissal rule catches up to those tasks.  Not sure how that dynamic will work; it is quite different than the old one.  <br><br>- Maybe if I start with a new book, I can avoid some of these concerns -- at least for a time.  But I have so many things going on, I am pretty sure my list will get pretty long pretty quickly, and these concerns would come into play again.  Plus I am somewhat hesitant to start a new list, since I've come to rely so strongly on my existing one.  I can't trust the system if I keep starting over with a new list.<br><br>- I've been using the stalagmite/stalactite method for managing work/home locations.  I really do like having them grouped like this on the page.  If necessary, I can just gloss over the half of the page that isn't my current focus of attention.  It really hasn't been a consideration for dismissal, so much as a matter of focus.  Having things all mixed together was disorienting.  So, I'd like to keep doing stalagmite/stalactite.  But, how to make that work with the new rules?  <br><br>- Also, I really like reading a page from top to bottom.  Going backwards up the page just makes me dizzy.  :-)    So, because of this, and because I want to keep stalagmite/stalactite, maybe I'll modify the rules slightly, and at the completion of a task, I'll simply go to my last page and start working the items there, top to bottom, like I do with AF1.  This approach will still keep me focused on the most current page at least, if not the latest tasks.  I'll try some different approaches here and report back what works for me.<br><br>- The daily dismissal rule seems somewhat arbitrary.  Some days, I have a full 12 hours or more of discretionary time.  Other days are blocked off with meetings and/or travel and I can't even open my AF book at all.  Is there a way to use the new dismissal rule but not tie it to the arbitrary timeframe of "every day"?   I'll try the "every day" approach, but it just doesn't seem as elegant as the automatic dismissal approach of AF1 that just naturally meshes with how often you cycle through the list.<br><br>Well, I'll give it a try and see how it goes.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Seraphim<br><br>Just a quick question. If AF is working fine for you why do you feel the need to change to AF2? I don't mean this in any other way than just I'm curious as to why. I think the old adage "if it ain't broke don't fix it" comes to mind.<br><br>I can see advantages to me for using AF2 especially as I stopped using original AF some time ago but if I was still using original AF and it was working fine I don't think I'd see the need to change to the updated system. If the tool I choose works for the job I want it to do I don't tend to go looking for a replacement (unless of course something new and shiny tempts me away!! ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim::<br><br>That sounds as if you've got around 1,000 tasks on your list. That's not a task list - it's a backlog. You can't expect any system to work if you are trying to feed a backlog that size through it. The best way to thin your list out is to scrap it and start a new one in the way I suggest in the instructions. I'd also take the opportunity to review how many things you have committed yourself to.<br><br>As for the other points you raise:<br><br>1) You will find it a lot easier to combine both Home and Work lists if you have a much smaller list.<br><br>2) If reading up the page makes you dizzy, then enter tasks from the bottom of the page upwards and then you can read down the page instead of up it.<br><br>3) If you have days on which it is impossible to do any work on AF, then they don't count as days for dismissal purposes. It's best to identify those days in advance though.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim,<br><br>I also have lots of active pages. But my impression of AF2 is quite different from yours. First of all, I think I don't understand rules quite well even in Portuguese, or maybe I always adapt a little bit. The fact that I don't have to read twice made AF2 easier. So I went to the first page of my third notebook (it is a thin one) and dismissed three items. It seems it is going to be much easier for me to dismiss. : )  <br><br>In the past months I've been reading pages in AF2 way and though it my sounds a little bit strange, I really enjoy reading it. There are many tasks to be done and I don't think I procrastinate anymore nor I get anxious or in despair while I see so many things that are waiting. Again, AF2 will help me dismiss many of those tasks. <br><br>I prefer to copy all dismissed items instead of highlighting them. I write them in a list in my notebook. So far I have the list of all dismissed items from notebook 1 and I have no motivation to do any of them ;-) (Just to give an example, I have to change the address where I vote. Quite irrelevant a task - it won't make any big difference.) I like to read all items occasionally and it is easier as they are gathered together. <br><br> I am quite dispersive on the web so I decided to have a page (front and back) only for computer tasks.<br>"There's a world of difference between deciding on impulse to go to an unproductive website (for example), and writing down a task to visit that website. Writing it down brings different parts of the brain into use." Mark Forster<br>It works like the list of errands just to gather things. It is diferent form a context. If I want to navigate, I write in the list what I want to see. However if I am writing many tasks and some are to be done on the web, I don't have to go to the list, it is an option. Or maybe I will copy it to the list later. I<br><br>One thing I think I need to pay more attention is to write everything I have or want to do. I do not write many things and they don't get done.<br><br>I see no reason to start a new list. Mine is OK for me. I am just looking for a new video to understand it better. :-)<br><br></div>

<div class="content">If I had loads of pages I'd look to dismiss much of it, and shunt it onto something like a categorised 'someday/maybe' list, for review from time to time.<br><br>Eg I have lots of project ideas I'd like to do at home, but they really belong on a separate project list, not a daily action list. <br><br>I may start on a few of them in the next year, but don't want/need to wade through *all* of them as part of a daily routine.</div>

That just seems to be the amount of stuff I have to deal with right now.  Yes, some of those things are "ideas" or "areas to explore" or "to do if I have time" kinds of things, and tasks like that usually get dismissed.  But I've already got a couple books like that archived as backlogs, and I really don't want to create another one, since 80% of the tasks will show up in my new book within a few days anyway.  :-)<br><br><br>****************************************<br>I'd also take the opportunity to review how many things you have committed yourself to.<br>****************************************<br><br>Yes, but I'm letting AF do that, since it does it so well.

And it seems I always have a dozen or more pages "on the verge" of being dismissed.

But it's still worth exploring someday."  So, I transfer it to my Tickler file, for say, 6 to 12 months in the future.  Seems to be a good way to handle some of those items.</div>

<div class="content">Thank you, Mark, for sharing this!!  I had started AF quite awhile ago ... I have had one family crisis after another this year - sort of drowning.  But at least all the stuff is going in the one notebook instead of dozens of envelopes.<br><br>I think parts of AF2 will work better for me ... I have been going from the back the last few months because that is all I can do - remind myself of what MUST be done.  But a good thing is, as I cruise through the pages every once in while, I find lots to cross off.<br><br>When things calm down a little more, hopefully soon (had illnesses, death, surgery, and a whole bunch more I can't share ...) ... then I will formalize it more again.  I am implementing it as I can.<br>  <br>Thank you! ~ Diane Clancy</div>

<div class="content">I've been pondering over the switch to AF2.  And I've been thinking...  I *really do* like AF1, and have gotten quite used to it.  I can trust it, it works very intuitively for me.  <br><br>And in my earlier days with AF1, if I was feeling overwhelmed or uncertain about how many urgent tasks I had buried in that list somewhere, then I would switch into "urgency mode".  For me, this meant writing down the things that were bothering me, whatever was on my mind -- and maybe, scanning through the pages to find those pesky urgent items, and moving them to my last page.  And then, jump to my last page, and start working the list as usual.  <br><br>AF2 seems to keep you in that mode indefinitely.  <br><br>So, here is what I'm thinking.  Why not work AF in two different "modes"?  One mode is for the usual work, when you are feeling on top of things, and have enough discretionary time to follow the AF1 methodology.  But then if you start feeling a bit lost or anxious about missing urgent items, switch to "urgent mode", and work the list with the AF2 method (sans the AF2 dismissal method).   When the urgency goes away, revert to AF1.<br><br>You could let AF "prompt" you when to switch modes, as follows.   When you're feeling that urgency-anxiety, you don't need any prompting, you can just switch to AF2 mode.  But when you start that mode, you can write a task, "Switch back to AF1 when things calm down" or something like that.<br><br>Then, work your list from the end, following the AF2 rules.  Eventually, the anxiety will be resolved, you will be back on top of things, and the "Switch back to AF1" task will stand out.  So you switch back to AF1.<br><br>Any thoughts?</div>

<div class="content">I have been a big fan of AF from its beginning. I came on board as a former GTD-er, finally fed up with maintaining my list instead of DOING things. AF was a little teeny miracle to me and I love it.<br><br>I am SHOCKED AND AMAZED to read these directions for AF2 and to then realize that I had not been doing AF1 "properly"!! Whadya know, I was already doing AF2! <br><br>How cool is THAT?!? I was IN SYNC with Mark already!!! <br><br>--Still and ever a big fan</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br>By all means give AF2 a try. But I'm concerned that it won't work well with a list as long as yours because it would take so long to get back to the beginning of your list. The aim of AF2 is to gain a balanced workload over the entire list. I suspect that you would find that you spent nearly all your time on the last three or four pages and the rest would be nearly completely neglected.<br><br>On the other hand if you stay with AF1 you don't get the advantage of the better handling of urgent items.<br><br>While I was developing AF2 I experimented with using both AF1 and AF2 at the same time. Since they use the same list it's easy to switch between them. So whenever I felt that I had something urgent I would switch to "AF2 mode", and when I wanted to deal with less urgent stuff I would switch to "AF1 mode". For dismissal purposes I used the AF1 rules. I never quite succeeded in ironing out the bugs in this, but you might like to give it a try.<br><br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Seraphim, I can completely relate to your situation. My list of tasks builds quickly. I think I may have a solution for you, however. I suggest keeping associated lists for some tasks. For example, I used to have tasks to Read X book for every book I heard about or thought about. That can really enlarge your list in a hurry! Unless it is a book I really MUST read by a certain date or for an important purpose, I wouldn't add it to my list separately anymore. It's true that AF can filter out the books you "should" be reading, but for people like us with too many tasks, it gums up the system.<br><br>If you think about it, you may have a number of other such associated lists you can create. I have some for my hobbies (scrapbooking, writing, etc.). Again, unless there is something I am adding that is super important or deadlined, it makes sense to simply add "Scrapbook" or "Explore new writing ideas." That way I know I am engaging in these activities on a regular basis. You could even do this with "websites to check out" to further limit the size of your list. I have been working this way for several weeks now and absolutely love it. I no longer feel overwhelmed by a gigantic list. <br><br>Because I work digitally, I have these other lists in the same program on my IPhone so when I come to "Scrapbook," I can quickly access my Scrapbook list and see what I can be working on. I am keeping them in creation date order so if I choose to use the new AF2 dismissal rules for them I can.</div>

<div class="content">I'm going to give AF2 a try this week. In extension of Seraphim's comments it has got me interested in the evolution of the different approaches Mark has provided. Like Seraphim, I'm bound to always have a large number of items in my list and have no desire to cull it down. For me it's important I can maintain productivity in light of a large number of options/tasks/ideas. <br><br>In DIT one of the big plusses were the closed list effect and the fact that DIT encourages a feeling of 'I have done my days work and now I'm done for the day'. In AF1 the closed list effect was still present but that latter feeling of satisfaction of feeling you have accomplished all you needed for that day wasn't as pronounced (it depends on how you do AF I guess). Of course, on the other end other things were gained like being able to capitalize on intuitive processes. <br><br>In AF2 the closed list effect is conceded in able to deal with other the areas AF1 wasn't as strong in. Now AF2 lacks both the closed list effect and that DIT satisfying feeling of being done for the day. <br><br>AF1 was limited by the nature of people's work load and work environment, specifically in the amount and quality of one's discretionary time. I think AF2 is much more flexible in that it looks like it can cope with some of the areas AF1 didn't excel in it, notably urgent items and periods where a lot of urgent items take over how one spends their time. <br><br>The thing is if AF in general helps us choose what to do and AF2 handles rushes of urgent tasks, is AF2 doing something it wasn't at its original base meant to do? When I have had times were I had a lot of urgent tasks, I spend little time deciding what to do, because it is self evident. To me it's a matter of efficiency,..<br><br>One of the downfalls of GTD is having to spend time deciding and formulating. If you are a knowledge worker there is too much input to maintain a water tight system, ie. you spend more time maintaining a system than being involved in worthwhile activities. Ironically because one of GTD's philosophies is to achieve a mind like water state (I think GTD is flawed in terms of achieving this philosophy with its methodology).  <br><br>With AF2 and AF1 to lesser effect (keeping in mind I haven't started AF2 yet), it seems there is inordinate time spent entering tasks and evaluating tasks that aren't relevant depending on when you are doing AF. To make an anology, why look at the dinner menu when you are having breakfast. And why add 'chocolate snack' to the menu when you plan to eat it now, regardless. You can make the case that AF2, while more waterproof, has some unneeded overhead at the cost of running the system. <br><br>I do like the idea of doing both AF1 and AF2, toggling between modes. I think electronic solutions offer a bit more flexibility switching between 'modes'. The software I use allows  one to switch between modes and even 'menus' similar to the analogy I made, without having to do much extra data-entry.</div>

<div class="content">Talking 'bout first impressions, I'd say AF2 will be easier to use  for me than AF. <br><br>Three reason:<br>1) No more need for the tweak of writing a daily list of actions that will be done before I look at my AF list. The last page of the AF2 will probably serve the same porpose (dealing with urgent stuff).<br><br>2) Attacking the list not only on its end but also at its beginning and dismissing stuff, helps preparing my weekly reviews, where dismissed tasks are either re-enterd in my AF list or go onto my Someday list.<br><br>3) Reading the whole list every day is what I do already, but I call it "daily review". It helps to get the big picture of my stuff. If I can't go through my list within 30 minutes max, I know that there is something wrong , usually bad project planning.<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">I agree strongly with Peter Knight that I miss the DIT feeling of having done a day's work.  With AF, I feel the long list weighing on me all the time.  I was definitely sleeping better when I followed DIT.  I appeared to get more done at the start of AF1, but I am not certain it has been sustained.<br><br>One of the strengths of AF2 may be that it more nearly automates dismissing tasks.  As MF and others have written repeatedly, reluctance to dismiss tasks undermines AF1 and anything that overcomes resistance to dismiss is good.<br><br>It seems to me that AF2 is not a million miles away from DIT modified in the following ways.<br>- Write new tasks under the entry for tomorrow in a task diary  (as in pure DIT)<br>- Go back through today's page and recent pages looking for tasks that stand out and do them in any order you like (as in AF1 or AF2)<br>- Ideally you'll clear them all, but don't worry if you don't.<br>- Any task that is on the task diary page for a week ago is on notice for dismissal (shades of AF2).<br><br>This may give some of the benefits of DIT, AF1 and AF2.</div>

<div class="content"><<Peter - what software are you using?>><br><br>Mindmanager with some powerful addons by gyronix called resultsmanager and gyronix. It's really amazing what you can do with the combined setup. It's a little overblown if you can work productively with a simple notepad, but if you have complex array of commitments and tasks like some of us on the forum with long lists have, it's mindblowingly good imo! Especially if you are a knowledge worker who spends most working time behind a pc.<br><br>Creating an example video has been on my list for awhile, just haven't gotten round to it yet.</div>
