<div class="content">I've been experimenting with micro time-boxing this week  and so far the benefits have been that it beats resistance pretty well. <br><br>My experimenting is on-going  and I'm hoping it will  help me balance my routines and  inbox management  against getting a backlog of tasks done. <br><br>One way to explain the method  is this. <br><br>I created two Category Lists. The first list is for  items that are routine, like checking emails, processing inboxes, or  reviewing notes and projects.    The second list is for items that are my backlog and more traditional tasks that likely get created from routine activities on list 1<br><br>Now for the micro time-boxing element:  I set a  repeating timer for 5 minute intervals.  In the first 5 minute interval I work on  an item from list 1 (routines). When the 5 minutes is up, I immediately note where I left off if needed and  switch to doing a tasks on list 2(Backlog).  When the next 5 minute period is complete, I note as needed where I left off and switch back to a task on list 1.  Repeat for at least an hour.<br><br>Picking an item on either list has really low resistance because I'm only spending 5 minutes on it I have found that  alternating between the two lists  gives me a feeling that I'm making progress on my tasks on list 2 but I'm also paying attention to the routines of list 1.  It feels balanced.<br><br>This sounds like the dreaded multi-tasking but with complete focus for 5 minutes it is really just one thing at a time and I can easily justify postponing other things for 5 minutes in favor of full focus.<br><br>I have experimented with 5 minute intervals, 10 minute intervals and 15 minute intervals.  I am noticing  that the higher the resistance to my list, the shorter the intervals need to be. So I am oddly favoring 5 minute intervals.<br><br>If I somehow finish the task before the 5 minutes is up.  I can pick a new task on the same list but I don't switch categories until the 5 minutes is up.<br><br>It actually takes some will-power to stop doing a task when the time is up but it has a way of drawing you back the to that  task when the next interval arrives. Some call this  the Hemmingway Effect.<br><br>This approach  is also a little like the HIIT method (High Intensity Intervals Training) in the exercise world, so it isn't something you can necessarily do all day.  But for me it is a good way to have a burst of productivity for an hour when I need a jolt.<br><br>Part of my experiment is also doing a ramp up of the length of time.  For example, 5 minute intervals in the 1st hour, 10 minute intervals in the 2nd hour. 15min in the 3rd hour and 30 minute intervals in the 4th.   For these extended periods, I need to make sure "take a break" is a task on the routine list.<br><br>This all sounds a little extreme and crazy but I thought I would share anyway. I would love to hear your thoughts on the pros and cons to this.<br><br>Brent</div>

<div class="content">I often work in 5 minute intervals.  <br>Sometimes when I am starting the day, and need to get in the mood,  I will start with 1 minute intervals, with checklist items, and work up to 2, 3, 4, 5 minute intervals.   <br>Make a game of it.</div>

<div class="content">See my first book "Get Everything Done" which is mainly based on a powerful method of time-boxing.<br><br>And for an even more dynamic method of time boxing see my comment on the blog post at <a href="../blog/How To Do The Same Old Thing (Again).html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2020/12/4/how-to-do-the-same-old-thing-again.html</a></div>

<div class="content">@Mark H I'm glad I'm not the only one that likes short time boxes!  I like how you framed it with the sentiment "and need to get in the mood"   I think that is the part I like most about it.<br><br>@Mark F  --- I'll have to reread "Get Everything Done" -- I didn't recall specific time-boxing terminology but perhaps that is new phrase since 2000 :)</div>

<div class="content">Brent:<br><br>Yes, the descriptor "time-boxing" hadn't been invented then. But the concept had - by me!<br><br>In short, I recommended dividing your work up into several categories, e.g. email, paper, phone, project x, project y, etc. And then spending 5 minutes on each project in turn, then 10, then 15 and so on. Whenever a project became empty (such as when you cleared all your email), then you reduced the time slot for that project by 5 minutes each pass until there was more work to do in that category.<br><br>It's difficult for me to believe that the book was published over 20 years ago. Technology in the workplace has changed completely, but the principles are still the same.</div>

<div class="content">Does anyone know of an iOS app that lets you preset a series of timers in this way? I used to use an app called 30/30, but it’s now defunct.</div>

<div class="content">Is it gone?  I still have 30/30 on my iphone.  i like it.  I also have MultiTimer, I don't use it.  30/30 is great that it would set a routine like: work 30, break 5, exercise 1, repeat.  I'm not aware of another app that would do this.</div>

<div class="content">Thank you, IanS, Alan!  I’ve downloadEd MultiTimer and it looks good!<br><br>30/30 stopped working for me, and is no longer in the App Store or even in my purchased apps.  Such a beautiful little app, I loved using it!</div>

<div class="content">As a college student completing tasks efficiently and time-management are two important skills that I struggle with. Therefore I was intrigued, when I came across this idea of micro time-boxing. After trying out micro time-boxing, I have to say that I have a mixed impression. My personal experience with this has allowed me to identify a pro and a con of this method.<br>   The idea of micro time-boxing is a method used to tackle multiple tasks. When using this method, two or three tasks would be selected. Then for a short amount of time one task would be focused upon. When time is up, this task is switched with another task and the process is repeated, with breaks for every 1-2 hours. <br>   The major advantage of this method is that doing this allows for large workloads to be more manageable. When completing assignments, I sometimes simply lose motivation to do assignments that feel like it would take hours to complete. However due to this method, I could now break down tasks and only work on them for a short amount of time, preventing the time length of the work from discouraging me. <br>   A major disadvantage of using this method is that switching tasks every few minutes can disrupt the focus I had on the assignment, creating a desire to complete the previous task and preventing me from focusing on the new task. The original post claims this as an advantage because this, “has a way of drawing you back to that task when the next interval arrives”. While I do agree with that, the problem is that the desire to complete the previous task is so strong that it prevents me from accomplishing anything.<br>   These are two major aspects about using the micro time-boxing in my experience, and I am hoping to further improve my usage of this.</div>

<div class="content">I tend to agree with Cal Newport, “Deep Work” that it takes time to really get into complex tasks and it is not good to switch away from those after only 5 or even 15 minutes. Perhaps if your task were of the sort “manually add these 5000 sums” it may pay to do in short bursts.  I am still fond of the high school schedule, which mark turned me onto last year: 50 minutes work, bookmarking your spot, and 10 minutes switch off to easy stuff, then switch back.<br><br>In this case the switch helps get out of fatigue ruts yet the time is enough to really get started on your best thoughts.</div>

<div class="content">Venkata:<br><br>There are a lot of possible ways of time boxing, and you can experiment to find the one that suits you best.<br><br>Since your main problem appears to be that you find it difficult to stop the task you are on, you might find one of the following suits you:<br><br>a. Use the "boxes" but not the "time". In other words have your short-list of tasks but, instead of working for a specified length of time, work on each for as long as you feel like working on it and then pass on to the next task.<br><br>b. Use the method described in my book "Get Everything Done" and work on each task in turn for 5 minutes, then work on each task for 10 minutes, then work on each task for 15 minutes, increasing each box by 5 minutes a time until the task is completed.<br><br>c. Or you can try increasing the length of time-box without changing tasks. So take your first task. Work on it for 1 minute. Decide if you want to continue, and if you do work on it for 2 minutes, then 3 minutes and so on until you decide you don't want to work on it any more. Then do the same for the next task, and so on.<br><br>d. You can also do the last example (c.) as a pyramid. You work your way up as in c., but you then have to work your way back down again. e.g. 1-2-3-4-5-4-3-2-1. If you succeed in working your way up to 10 minutes and down again you will have worked continuously on the task for 1 hour 40 minutes.<br><br>The last two examples (c. and d.) are extremely effective against high-resistance tasks and produce very concentrated work.</div>

<div class="content">I like those suggestions Mark.  I am going to try c. and d.<br><br>My experience with micro time boxing which I still do quite a bit is that it works best for short periods of times.  Sort of a time boxes with in a box. For example, I devote an hour or two of working though relatively easy or high resistance tasks in 5-10 increments.  Once I get the momentum going and feel like I'm in a clearer space. I switch to a deeper work mode knowing that I broke through some of the noise of smaller tasks or the resistance of the bigger tasks.</div>

<div class="content">Something I was doing last week that is similar, is I was doing "the next 2 minutes" system, which is basically the same as "the next hour" except it's for a 2 minute time period.  I would write something to do for 2 minutes and then do it, come back, write something else, and so on.  If you have more than 1 thing that can fit in 2 minutes, then you can write down more than one thing. Granted, some things will take longer than 2 minutes once you get started, and it can't be helped (I found it takes 6 minutes to take out the garbage for instance), and that's ok. One of the things I did was go to a furniture store (IKEA) to buy something, which obviously took more than 2 minutes.</div>
