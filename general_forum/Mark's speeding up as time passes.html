<div class="content">Hi Mark<br>How much time out of your workday does writing all those tasks down on your 3 column list take up?  I'm guessing that they are mostly sub-tasks such as more than one entry to pay 20 bills rather than one entry: pay bills.  Ust curious....what's the advantage to invest time in writing so many small units of work.  Even when I don't do the entire task in one go, if it's still on the list, it means I need to keep working on it.  I'm lost....where's the advantage of all that re-writing?<br>learning as I go</div>

"The page needs room for" is not the same as "he goes through". I am not being pedantic. One of them is correct applied to my system, and one is not.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark<br>LOL!  Of course, I'm making guesses.  You haven't published the actual thing yet.  Yes, I'm assuming that > 100 tasks in a work day is likely to be many very small tasks based on an average work day being somewhere between 6 to 12 hours.  But I'll guess I'll learn at the same time everybody else does!  lol!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Blame me for starting this.  I think Mark is saying he doesn't actually go through 100 tasks in a day.  Yet for some odd reason he needs room for that many.  Stay tuned...</div>

<div class="content">I must admit I'm a bit concerned when I hear about such a high volume of tasks mentioned. I suppose this is because of the emphasis on 'little and often', but this would be enough to frazzle my brain at least! I suppose the number of tasks reflects how busy one is. But I don't want to be that busy and I don't want to feel stressed with a long task list.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Leon,<br>The regular DIT allows you to finish your day's aims however works best for you.  I'm sure this AF amendment worn't interfere with it.  I'll bet that it's a tool that could come in handy when little and often might be the best choice in certain circumstances.  Some days I have no choice but to keep doing bits until it equals a whole!  lol!  I admire that he's created and offered many alternatives to get our work done.  ....whatever it takes to make the wheels go round.....<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>Of course, I'm only guessing like the rest of the board.  I'm making *assumptions" based on his past default modus operandi.  Look at Andreas Hofmann's pdf and you'll see his little and often style in action.  It cleared up much of my confusion when trying to understand his perspective. Yet, he has never recommended that we start goose-stepping to his cadance.  He simply offers up several alternatives to choose from.  I like to blend longer time blocks with short launches depending on both the job at hand and  my capabilities and attitude while I'm finishing it<br>We'll have to allow Mark the enjoyment of keeping us dangling while he polishes up his AF/DIT amendment.  Actually, this guessing game reminds me of opening windows in an Advent calendar and eating the daily treat behind each window! ....not quite as exciting as Christmas Eve but still exciting and fun!  I think Mark is having devilish fun building up the crecendo to the actual debut!   muuuuuaaaahhhhh! ! ! <br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Learning,<br><br>The business of rewriting tasks is hard to explain.  I have tried it both ways and rewriting a partially done task does help for some reason.  You get to close pages and rephrase tasks and that helps things move along.  It may be a psychological factor at work.  Even if I don't rephrase the task, seeing it in a different place in with different tasks makes it a different situation.  We talked about "relative difficulty" ... how Task A is hard when sitting next to Task B, but looks easier when next to Task C.</div>

<div class="content">Yes Learning, thanks for your insights...Actually I've been meaning to ask if you could tell me a bit about your weekly DIT set up (if you still use it?) - or if you could point me in the right direction to a related post? <br><br>My finding is that little and often certainly works, but I'm starting to suspect that I have more preference for working on *less* tasks for longer *chunks* of time, if that makes sense. I suppose this method of working is feasible with DIT or AF and would probably just mean cropping some commitments perhaps.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike<br>Good to see you!  Yes, I don't really understand it but I believe you!  Here's a little giggle.  After finishing my post, I fell down a cyber rabbit hole.  I can only guess that typing the words goose stepping and dangling brought me to this URL.....<br><br><a href="http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/images/publications/wct/2007-02-14/Dangle.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/images/publications/wct/2007-02-14/Dangle.jpg</a><br><br>Can you imagine the AF/DIT enforcement unit dressed in this get-up?  LOL!  This is almost as funny as Mark Forster's secret porn book cover!  <br><br>Leon, my system is basically a weekly DIT/GTD hybrid template over my regular system.  Daily I cull some tasks from my weekly aims list.  Most regular work is bundled  inlike batches guided by regular routines and/or checklists.  Most importantly, I limit the boring stuff to an acceptable minimum so that I can stay current.....ultimately to maximize my creative flow and..........................increase my free time!
