<div class="content">Every so often, I think I want to use dry erase boards that I can somehow carry around like a notepad. This usually dies a quick death, as (1) even the smallest commercial dry erase boards I encounter are too big and bulky, and (2) the writing would undoubtedly rub off when slipping them into a work bag.<br><br>I have found a solution to (1):<br><br>Find a spare CD jewel case, preferably the ultra-slim type, and insert a white piece of card stock into its lid. Standard insert size is 120mm square. If you are going to print on the card, e.g. a habit tracker, cut to 122.5mm by 121mm for a tight fit that will stay aligned with your writing. You will want thin-tipped dry erase pens, due to the small size of the writing surface.<br><br>There is a slight amount of ghosting when trying to wipe the plastic clean, even with a cleaning solution, but these are cheap enough to replace every week if needed–a box of 50 will last all year. The ghosting is only visible at an angle and makes only a colorless shadow.<br><br>As for (2),<br><br>- The slim size may allow slipping them into a crevice where they will remain relatively un-rubbed.<br>- Wrapping them in something may help, again much more practical due to the small size.<br>- Maybe you only need to take a blank one with you.<br>- Maybe they can just stay on the desk (haha). You can stand them up by opening the case a little bit. Imagining several of them standing authoritatively on the desk displaying important heads-up information feels great, though I don't know what I would write on them!<br><br>I probably won't use this long-term, but it was a fun discovery.</div>

<div class="content">For a full-page dry erase surface, just slip a card into a plastic page protector.<br>Again, printing on the page will give you a reusable checklist/tracker.<br>Protecting the writing is much easier: just keep it in a slim ring binder.</div>

<div class="content">Ever come across those 8-page booklets you can fold out of a sheet of LTR/A4 paper?<br>They're sort of neat, and they make me want to use one, but they're so dang SMALL!<br>Well, I've had this stack of tabloid paper sitting around for ages, because I once needed a single sheet of tabloid paper (size is two LTR pages side by side, similar to A3), so while I was fiddling around with the jewel case inserts, I realized I could fold a double-sized 8-page booklet out of the tabloid paper.<br><br>It's pretty cute, a nice little size. I could imagine using it for some weekly tracking purpose and then making a new one each Sunday. Well, I could *almost* imagine that, because again I have no idea what to write on it. Preprinted, perhaps more habit trackers or something? However, my home printer will not accept a page that big, so that's out.<br><br>There's always the option of a 4-page booklet out of a LTR page instead. It would be that same doubled size but with the option to print on. Four pages is almost a week... not counting weekends... maybe a page could handle two days... whatever...</div>

<div class="content">Small picture frames, with plastic or glass, can also become dry erase surfaces.<br>The glass promises to wipe off better than the CD jewel cases.<br>I am thinking of the minimalist designs that bring the glass right to the edge.<br>They'll be bulkier than the slim jewel cases, though.</div>

<div class="content">The technology you want exists in a product called Boogie Board.  You write with the fake pen, and press a button to erase it all.  If you don't want to save your notes from one place to the next it works marvelously.  But if you do want to save things while travelling, I haven't investigated the effectiveness of porting it about, whether it would write by being pressured or accidentally erased, but those issues can surely be solved with the appropriate container.</div>

<div class="content">Alan, I nearly bought a Boogie Board on Amazon! Unfortunately the reviews convinced me not to. There were widespread technical problems, chiefly the writing being too dim and the erase features ceasing to work. The happiest customers seemed to be those who had given them to very young children. Competing brands had similar problems and even less reliability. That led me to experiment with low-cost DIY methods instead.<br><br>Seraphim, thanks for the leads. Those erasers look like the Magic Eraser household cleaning product. I wonder if they're the same thing repackaged for people like me who wouldn't have thought of using them for dry erase.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim,<br><br>"These erasers are great at eliminating whiteboard residues:<br><a href="http://smile.amazon.com/3M-Whiteboard-Eraser-Whiteboards-581-WBE/dp/B000MFHX3U" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://smile.amazon.com/3M-Whiteboard-Eraser-Whiteboards-581-WBE/dp/B000MFHX3U</a> "<br><br>I just bought a Magic Eraser at Walmart, thinking it might be the same material. It does not fare any better on that CD case, or perhaps it has made just a slight difference. I may have described the effect poorly, as there is not any coloration on the plastic at all; it is just a contrast in the sheen, visible only from a shallow angle, but it lets you fully read what has been wiped off. Even if the Magic Eraser worked, I'm a little put off by "simply add water," which to me defeats the purpose of DRY erase.<br><br>The 98-cent small glass frame I bought wipes off completely with a dry paper towel. It is a half-inch thick, which is still bulky for my taste, but if I can find 1/4 inch or less, we'll have a winner.</div>

<div class="content">I think Magic Eraser is actually a very fine sandpaper. It might be rough enough to damage the shiny surface. So, as they say with stain removers, "Test in a small discrete area."<br><br>There are cleaning sprays that work fairly well.<br><br>Soap and water work well on several of ours, both the dollar store one and the fancy expensive office one.</div>

<div class="content">I bought some of the Magic Erasers to compare. Still waiting for them to arrive from Amazon. The texture looks a lot different than the 3M whiteboard erases. <br><br>The 3M erasers work great without any water for ordinary dry-erase markers. They leave the whiteboard very clean, and can help remove old residues.<br><br>The Lumocolor pens are erasable but more durable than ordinary dry-erase ink. It helps to use a little water with these. I have a little spray bottle of water next to my desk for that. But this isn't necessary for all surfaces, for example, a laminated piece of card stock as the surface. If you are using glass, I don't think you'd need any water.</div>

<div class="content">Ah, the 3M product must be different then.<br><br>Cricket, you're right: the Magic Eraser made very fine abrasions in the CD case's plastic. It now looks like Scotch tape's "magic" invisible type whereas before the erasing it looked like regular shiny tape.</div>
<h2>Reply by Cricket</h2>
<div class="meta">2019-02-4 16:34</div>
<div class="content">Bernie, the 3M product might be more of a solvent or soap. It says add water. Also, it might have an abrasive that's softer than ceramic white boards, but harder than CD cases.<br><br>(Bathroom cleansers talk about fine abrasives, ignoring that hardness is also important. A huge sponge won't scratch, but a small sand grain will.)<br><br>Glass and ceramic are fairly hard but also brittle. Melamine is softer, lighter, less brittle, and cheaper. Paint varies widely and depends on the backing and primer.<br><br>Yeah, I'm complicating things. Basically, don't assume things that look the same are the same.</div>

<div class="content">Why not write on the inside of the CD case, and tape the paper to the outside to use as a backdrop for visibility?</div>

<div class="content">These project folders, when combined with a white sheet of paper and the Lumocolor pens, make great portable whiteboards.<br><a href="http://smile.amazon.com/Universal-81525-Project-Folders-Jacket/dp/B004UNFEUE" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://smile.amazon.com/Universal-81525-Project-Folders-Jacket/dp/B004UNFEUE</a></div>

<div class="content">Don R,<br>I had not thought of that.<br><br>Seraphim,<br>Those folders seem a lot like page protectors, except maybe they have a smoother finish. But linked from that product, someone has gone ahead and packaged something specifically for this purpose:  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071HWJJ64/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_rlrwCb4CXS0BW</div>

<div class="content">In that  vein, white board material is sold in rolls for mounting on walls. You could buy a tiny strip and cut and paste a piece for you own custom solution.</div>

It would be a nice combination of a notebook with a whiteboard. Hm, it would actually go well with my Serial No-List method. Hm, maybe I could fit the small version in a large cargo-pants pocket.  Hm... hm...</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim,<br><br>I had missed the point of these markers you mentioned:<br><a href="http://smile.amazon.com/Staedtler-Lumocolor-Correctable-Pens-305FWP4/dp/B004SZ0YYU" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://smile.amazon.com/Staedtler-Lumocolor-Correctable-Pens-305FWP4/dp/B004SZ0YYU</a><br><br>Having read some of the reviews, now I get it! They seem to offer a balance between wet and dry erase, becoming permanent enough after a few seconds so as not to rub off on your hand as you continue to write, yet still erasable without liquid.<br><br>You did touch on this above, but I missed the significance.</div>

<div class="content">Yes, here is a video showing the difference.<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-hE6VDAG_I" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-hE6VDAG_I</a><br><br>BTW, the video is done by Wipebook, which makes portable whiteboard notebooks that are pretty good. I have a couple Wipebooks but honestly haven't found the ideal use for them.</div>
