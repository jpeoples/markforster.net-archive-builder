<div class="content">One aim of time management is perhaps to create a life of flow and ease, following the next thing that feels right, so whether one has a vision for a life of flow and ease or a time management system the intention - and the outcome - is the same?</div>

<div class="content">...so for example in the vision one might have "all my activities have an order, timing and organization which enables me to eliminate unnecessary activities and live with balance, pursuing activities that are refreshing and enjoyable."</div>

<div class="content">I think it depends on what your vision is... For example, one part of my vision has to do with my intimate relationship. For something like that I think the two approaches would be profoundly different in how they work. Yes, I could include in SF items like "surprise spouse" or "date night"...  But I would only do that if it flowed out of my Dreams experience. For example, I might spontaneously do a surprise for my partner and it goes so well that I want to include it in SF just to stay aware of that option (because I have memory issues). That's different from sitting down and saying, "Let me make a list of things that will deepen my relationship with my partner." I've tried that approach before and it hasn't worked all that well. I think the PULL part of Dreams is essential for this kind of vision.<br><br>As I was thinking about your post, I initially thought that SF is more useful for this part of my vision - course prep:<br><br>"My course prep is ready before classes start and I feel relaxed and confident about how the year will go. I'm excited about meeting and journeying with a new crop of students and all the ways we will learn from each other. The experience of preparing the course outlines was amazing! I was naturally drawn to work on them in a sustained manner. Although  a difficult and complex task, I enjoyed the creativity of prepping my courses and all the work was done in a relaxed manner with trust in the outcomes of the process. "<br><br>I do use an AF-like list for each course and I thought I was going to use this as an example of how AF and Dreams converge for this type of vision. But then I realized that the goal of AF/SF is about outcomes, whereas my Dreams vision is very strongly focused on PROCESS as well as outcomes. In both cases I need to have my courses prepared. But one way is more fun and easy and creative and the other way is more painful. <br><br>I'm glad you started this conversation because I've been struggling with the relationship between Dreams and SF/AF. <br><br>Instinctively, I've remained very conservative with my SF use. At this point, it's mostly an "aide memorire" and a place where I capture everything I have committed to do in my life. Occasionally I work the list in a SF way, but only when I feel drawn to do that, maybe twice a week. I scan it every day, though, to refrresh my awareness of things I have committed to. And sometimes during that scan I dismiss items or even delete them. <br><br>I'm in an uneasy relationship with SF, because I know it's not really SF the way I'm using it. I'm very interested in how others are experiencing this relationship between AF/SF and Dreams.</div>

<div class="content">"The goal of AF/SF is about outcomes, whereas my Dreams vision is very strongly focused on PROCESS as well as outcomes. In both cases I need to have my courses prepared. But one way is more fun and easy and creative and the other way is more painful."<br><br>Which is fun and which is painful and why?  I would expect both to be fun if course prep is something you like to do.<br><br>I also wondered about "My course prep is ready before classes start and I feel relaxed and confident about how the year will go."  I've never been a teacher, but I wondered about the need and value of having a course fully prepared.  It seems to me a broad outline of the year (semester) (week) and detailed prep no more than a week or maybe a month ahead would be a good way to go.  Adapt plans according to the class.  Or is this what you mean by "prep is ready"?</div>

<div class="content">Alan, the PUSH approach is always painful for me, by definition. <br><br>You're going to be sorry you asked about what's involved in course prep. :) <br><br>Prepping for a course has its fun aspects, but it has TONS of admin. It's like planning a major project. There are so many departments to coordinate with, so much that has to be done in advance (selecting & ordering texts; selecting articles & ordering course pak, booking classroom technology, selecting & ordering videos to be used in the course, identifying and inviting guest speakers...). Lots more, all of it has to be done before the course starts. There is also a significant research component to prep for the course, both in terms of revising the themes/topics of the course and overall pedagogical strategies to improve issues identified last year. These things all feed into my course outline, which is my contract with my students and has to be be nailed down by the second week of the course. I'm not allowed to change anything after that point.<br><br>More detailed prep also needs to be partly done in advance, so that I have time for my research and publishing throughout the academic year. My job also involves sitting on a lot of committees  and these all start up again in the fall. I am required to do community service as part of my job. And each day there are untold numbers of student emails, all of which need to be answered within 24 hours. And more...<br><br>The main issue for me is that if I don't get as much course prep done as possible for my 5 courses, then I will not be able to do my research and publishing, which is what I'm mainly hired to do. And when I go up for tenure in a few years, I only get to keep my job if I've got enough publications. <br><br>Let me hasten to add that I love my job, it's my dream come true. It draws on a wide range of my gifts and has many exciting challenges. And I am having an impact on my world around me.<br><br>Once the academic year starts, I don't come up for air again until April. So whatever I can do in advance will reduce my stress throughout the school year. And I'll be able to more fully enjoy what I do, rather than feeling exhausted and near burnout half the time. That's what I want for myself.</div>

<div class="content">Thank you Sylvia.  Back to the thread subject:<br><br>I'm finding that although my work system is performing great, my home system less so because its content doesn't excite me.  So I think what's needed is to go through a process of finding stuff that does excite me.  That process isn't found in AF.<br><br>When I read "Dreams and AF may be flip sides of each other", I therefore don't see it.  They may be complementary, but they aren't opposite approaches to the same goal.  <br><br>Dreams is a system to develop and strengthen goals.  New goals lead to new activity.  AF is a system to develop and strengthen activity.  AF tends to lead to more of the same activity.  At least to the point where it stagnates as it has for me now (at home).  Then it leaves you with no instruction for breaking free.</div>

<div class="content">Hmmm...so I wonder what happens if the vision is "dreams and autofocus are working in perfect harmony for me; all my activities lead me to goals that are my dreams. Unnecessary and unhelpful tasks and activities are easily dismissed and tasks that take me to my highest and best vision stand out to me easily."</div>

<div class="content">Michael, I think it might be more powerful if your vision is less abstract and more concrete. Remember that it should also include feelings. When I read my vision, I feel something moving inside me that says "Yes! That's the life I want!"<br><br>In other words, spell out the details of your "highest and best vision".</div>

<div class="content">I agree silvia. I wanted to convey the link between the two rather than the passion required to drive them both.</div>

<div class="content">If my characterization of the two systems is true, then the strongest synthesis would seem to be:<br>Use dreams to generate and refine goals. Use these to generate and evaluate tasks in AF. Use AF to keep doing those. Use dreams again to keep the drive going.</div>
