<div class="content">Mark encourages self-coaching as one of the three essential parts of his Dreams method (the other two being Goal Achievement Method & What’s Better?’ list). <br><br>If I recall correctly, Mark's dialogue is between his present self, and future self (the future self being Mark who is living the life he is dreaming about). <br><br>During our own self-coaching session, is the coach supposed to be our future self? Or am I confusing this with the long-term goal setting exercise. <br><br>Thanks.</div>

<div class="content">Curiously this is the part of "Dreams" I had least success with! Perhaps I'm not humble enough to listen to my future self's advice.<br><br>I found more advantage in answering good insightful questions in a journal e.g.<br><br>What is this time in your life like?<br><br>What would achieving X do for you?<br><br>As i let go of the lies I tell myself...<br><br>The good thing about sharing my mother's/father's view of things is...<br><br>What will be different about the way you see yourself if you X?<br><br>If I disown the person I once was I would have to let go of...<br><br>You might try the NLP SCORE method useful as a potted version.</div>

<div class="content">michael:<br><br>If you read the dialogues in the book, you will see that the Future Self never offers advice. His role is limited to asking insightful questions.</div>

<div class="content"><<never offers advice. His role is limited to asking insightful questions.>><br><br>My late supervisor used to say something similar, mainly that, if you ask 2-3 questions that stay with your clients post-session, you've earned your fee.</div>

<div class="content">Friends:<br><br>I just finished the first part of my "Mark's Forster Project" and now I'm about to start the Dreams practice.<br><br>Yes, as Mark says, your future self only asks insightful questions, buy as the dialogs are THE thing I do almost daily, I noticed two things:<br>1) I lost sometimes the idea of a "future self". Instead, he (my other self) appears as a kind of general coach or philosopher.<br>2) Even if he makes a lot of questions, sometimes he gives me an advice. This happens when I'm implementing some specific time management technique and he instructs me how to do it.<br><br>Yes, it sounds a bit schizophrenic.</div>
