<div class="content">Hi everyone, <br><br>I'm interested in how others review / evaluate their progress using AF2 (or other Systems for that matter). My view of AF2 is that it is excellent for keeping tasks moving forward. I would like a way of evaluating and acknowledging my progress, perhaps weekly, as I seem to get caught up on all there is to *do* rather than taking satisfaction for what I've managed to get *done*. <br><br>I guess the obvious answer is a weekly review as in GTD but I'd be interested specifically in any quantitative and qualitative formats / approaches.<br>  <br>Thanks in anticipation.</div>

<div class="content">My own approach has simply been to go by the way I feel. If I'm feeling in control of everything (rather than overwhelmed) then I'm on the right track.<br><br>For something more concrete, what you've already suggested would be one approach - the GTD Weekly Review, but at a higher level than the usual one - so you get a sense of where you are heading.<br><br>The AF systems really operate at the runway level so any time/life management approach that works at a higher level would probably also be compatible for longer-term planning, such as those by Stephen Covey (Seven Habits/First Things First) or Tony Robbins (Time of Your Life).<br><br>Tony Robbins has a specific suggestion of noting down your accomplishments (rather than just tasks done) once a week in a journal and reviewing it monthly/yearly, which can provide a lot of satisfaction when looking back. This might be the sort of thing you are after.</div>

<div class="content">Yes Frank, that is the sort of thing I am after - to boost my confidence a little. Thanks for the lead :)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Leon,<br><br>I am a top down planner.  Years ago I did the life goal planning exercise in Alan Lakein's book and have been working that list ever since.  My procedure is to have my life goals broken down by sub goals and milestones down to the level of one month.  Weekly I review the month's goal list and decide what I want to be doing to work on them.  Those get put into my current (in this case AF) time management system for execution.<br><br>I distinguish between things I feel I must do and things I want to do and handle them very differently on the planning level ... even if they must coexist in my daily time management system.  But since they must coexist there, I need a way to keep my focus on those want to do items so they don't get lost in the have to do jungle.  Time management systems don't do that for you ... life planning systems do.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Leon,<br><br><br>for me it is quite simple. Once in a while i go back in my notebook and count the closed pages (the ones with no open task). Enough satisfaction for me ;-)<br><br><br>Ciao,<br>Steffen<br></div>

<div class="content">I'm evaluating progress by how far "behind" I am.  I started AF2 with my existing list and whenever I draw the dismissal line, I add the current date to it on the right hand side.  This gives me a timeline of when I dismissed those tasks and as I dismiss, I find the beginning of the list coming closer to the end of the list.  For example, this week I started with 8 pages in my client notebook, with tasks dating back to February.  Using the AF2 dismissal rules, I am now down to 4 pages, with the earliest task dating back to 6/12.  That makes me feel better when the earliest dates are a little more closer to now.   Ideally, I think I'd like to keep that earliest date to within a week from the current day.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Leon<br><br>I keep a spreadsheet with the no of items outstanding per page to show total no of o/s items and that identifies the percentage of tasks completed - I fiind that to be a good statistic.  I also note the no of new items added per day which shows whether there has been a net increase or decrease.  If you want a copy of the template please feel free to email me at mail[at]meovoto.co.uk</div>

<div class="content">In the past I tried to keep up a habit of GTD-style weekly reviews, but it seemed more of a hassle than a help. My weekly reviews tended to focus on top-down "shoulds" rather than the bottom-up "stands out" approach of AF that I find more effective.<br><br>Now I keep a Post-It note on the first page of my list with a running tally of the number of tasks crossed off each day of the week. Looking at these tallies over a period of days is enough for me to see if I'm on track or if I need to re-evaluate.<br><br></div>
