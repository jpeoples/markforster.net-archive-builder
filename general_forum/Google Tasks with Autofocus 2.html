<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-07-13 21:57</div>
<div class="content">Autofocus 2 is working out very well, and I am enjoying a level of productivity even higher than what I achieved with AF1. I'm able to follow a 100% straight implementation of the AF2 workflow and get those urgent items properly knocked out when when needed.<br><br>I have completely dumped my email clients (Mail on Mac and Outlook on Windows) in favor of extremely capable and always accessible Gmail.<br><br><a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/help/tasks/" rel="nofollow">http://mail.google.com/mail/help/tasks/</a><br><br>At the end of last year, Google implemented a light task manager called (strangely enough) Google Tasks. The simplicity of it initially tickled my fancy, however with the hard page end requirements of AF1, I discounted it.<br><br>Now, with AF2, it works like a dream. Adding a task with a link to the referring email is a click or keystroke away. It works on any computer I find myself in front of, and is also  accessible from my iPhone.<br><br>Tasks are added at the top, like most task managers. This actually is more intuitive (for me at least) having the most recent item at the top of the list. Blocks that are "on notice" for dismissal get indented as subtasks of the line drawn for that day. At the beginning of the new day, the line with its subtasks gets moved to another list, and a new line is drawn and on notice items get indented.<br><br>-palletguru<br></div>

<div class="content">Very interesting! How can you move the tasks to another list? I also think that writing the note "Up for dismissal" works and Having a Dismissed task with all dismissed tasks indented underneath.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-07-14 16:10</div>
<div class="content">Mel,<br><br>Moving tasks to another list is accomplished by entering a task (the "line) above the block to be put on notice (I use a dash and today's date). Then, I indent each task below the line (remember, this list is upside down in relation to a written AF2 list), making them subtasks of the line task.<br><br>To move them to another list, click on the arrow to the right of the line task, and in the "move to" dialog box, select the other list. Since all the tasks below the line are indented and therefore are considered subtasks of the line task, they move with the line task to the new list.<br><br>-palletguru</div>

<div class="content">Is there a way yet to easily print google tasks? Last time I played with it, no luck.</div>

<div class="content">Yes, they have added a few features since launch. Actions -> Print Task List allows for printing. Interestingly enough, Google Tasks just left beta today. It integrates nicely with Google Calendar. Here is a link to Google's blog site with a good summary of the functionality and a demonstration video:<br><br><a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/tasks-graduates-from-gmail-labs.html" rel="nofollow">http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/tasks-graduates-from-gmail-labs.html</a><br><br>Since I use Firefox, I have my Autofocus list always visible and editable in the sidebar (bookmark google tasks, then enter bookmarks, right click the tasks bookmark, and check "open in sidebar"). The task window still pops up in Gmail, but I find it handy to always have my AF2 list visible - it tends to steer my attention back to being productive. Note - you can't print from the sidebar. You will have to enter the task window in Gmail to print out your lists.<br><br>-palletguru</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the info about printing. It looks really nice printed. <br><br>Based on that and the realization (thanks to the "stuck at the end" discussion) that I have 30 open pages, I am going to try AF2 on google tasks as you describe. <br><br>One question though, do you make a google tasks bookmark from the pop up window or is there a dedicated webstie for goolge tasks? Ic an't figure out the former and cannot find the latter.</div>

<div class="content">I've also been using Google Tasks even with AF1 but it's really perfectly suited for AF2. Now with the printing option it's even easier to review. I keep completed tasks in place--rather than clearing them--in order to distiguish blocks for future dismissal. However, since the completed task is really just a place holder, when two completed tasks are adjacent, I just delete one. This also helps keep the list clear so more tasks appear on one screen.<br><br>I have adopted a (very) minor tweak which I'm very happy with: I never allow one "block" of tasks to have fewer than two tasks in it. That way every day at least 2 items are up for dismissal. So any time two single tasks are separated by a completed action, I just delete the completed action and join the single tasks into one block.<br><br>Regular interspersal of frequent, simple tasks keeps the list moving and virtually guarantees that only 2 tasks (but never less) are up for dismissal every day.<br><br>This is working very well for me.</div>

<div class="content">VERY interesting, and tempting, even though I have tried electonic methods for AF1 and really like my Moleskine notebook (medium size, ruled, hard cover).<br><br>I've got a lot of emails and other information invested in Outlook 2007, but I also have a few gmail/googlemail email addresses.  Why?  Because I am a one-man business working abroad usually in developing countries.<br><br>BUT I am wary of switching to Google, much as i like GMail and the sound of Tasks because if the Internet is down, I'm stuffed, UNLESS Google will overcome this shortly as I think is the case.<br><br>But I'm still interested!<br><br>Roger J</div>

<div class="content">I bit the bullet and moved my AF2 list to Google tasks. I had a few reasons to do so but the main reason was that my paper list was 30 pages long (many tasks crossed out within those pages though) and it was getting disheartening paging through all the pages each morning.<br><br>So far so good, though I feel Google tasks is in-between paper and other task managment software. It's simple, so it's easy to enter items (but not as easy as paper) but doesn't have project tagging, start dates or other functionality I am used to with task lists (I used to use toodledo).<br><br>But I like it better than 30 pages. I really like dumping e-mails in it, and that the due dates appear seemlessly on the calendar. Thanks so much pelletguru for answering my google task questions</div>

<div class="content">@RogerJ<br><br>I had been a diehard Outlook user for many years before switching to the Mac and its Mail.app. Even when I made the switch, I still kept Outlook on my Windows side (using VMWare).<br><br>I bascially have moved away from email programs and gone exclusively to Gmail. All my accounts get pulled into my Gmail account, but gmail is very smart in managing this. If I get an email sent to my work email (not gmail), when I reply, gmail includes the account information for my work account. Gmail's tags (called Labels) are more powerful than folders since more than one label can be applied to a message. <br><br>One of the most useful features of Gmail is its ability to thread elements of the conversation together (I know Mail.app does this), and the tags remain on new emails in the thread. This is particularly helpful for regimenting emails within projects, but more importantly, I have a "waiting" tag (colored red) applied to tasks that I delegate. Using Gmail's multiple inboxes, I have all the items listed as waiting appear below my inbox. Once the answer get emailed back to me, I see the message with the "waiting" tag sitting in my inbox. <br><br>Google Gears allows for offline use of gmail, contacts, and calendar. I haven't tested to see if the tasks are included in the offline bundle. Gears is a plugin that works with all commonly used browsers. <br><br>If you can get over the web-based email look, I think you'll really enjoy gmail.<br><br>@vegheadjones<br><br>Glad it's working well for you. Another way to get tasks - you can make a tasks dashboard widget for Mac. Open the tasks page in Safari, and use the scissors to clip it, and it will appear in the dashboard. Works very slick. There really is no getting away from my AF2 list.<br><br>-palletguru</div>

<div class="content">The only... ONLY problem with this set up is the process of reentering tasks with notes. For example, say you have a task that repeats daily with notes i.e.:<br><br>Work on Project "X"<br>Note: Today I added this widget. Tomorrow I need to add three more widgets And call Joan. <br><br>Before you mark off the task as done, you need to reenter it as a new task. How do you do this?</div>
<h2>Reply by Mel</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-07-20 19:52</div>
<div class="content">Avrum, a simple way to do this is to just add a task immediately adjacent to the one you want to complete and re-add at the top. It could be anything like even just an X that you then complete as done. Then drag your task with associated note (this works with subtasks, too) to the top. This is the best workaround I've found, though most of the time for simple tasks, I simply re-type the task as I can do that quicker than copying and pasting.</div>

<div class="content">Mel, I was going to suggest the exact same thing - the task can keep changing. Just add the placeholder task, and drag the project task back up to the top of the list.<br><br>For detailed notes and access to multiple files on my project tasks, I insert hyperlinks to the project pages in Evernote - links in the task name are clickable from Google Tasks.</div>

<div class="content">@Christine B<br>give it a shot! The new version of OneNote will have web links as well. I agree it can be a bit much. Since I started Autofocus v.1 with a spiral-bound notebook, I have tried over a dozen different systems (both software and paper-based). This one works the best (...for now).<br><br>@Mel<br>ListOmni looks great (just checked it out on the app store). Definitely the slickest iPhone app that I've seen for managing multiple lists and projects. A stand alone app on the iphone that syncs with Google Tasks would be a wish come true - even though the iphone-optimized tasks in Mobile Safari works just fine, I really do prefer dedicated apps that load quickly for quick ubiquitous capture.<br><br>@Avrum<br>taskspaper for the iPhone would be incredible. I've been waiting for that since iPhone 2.0. Hopefully it reveals itself soon. <br><br>@vegheadjones<br>about Gears and Tasks. I upgraded to Firefox 3.5.1, and google still has not released an update for Gears that is compatible. As soon as I get it working, I'll pull the ethernet plug and see if Tasks is backed up along with Gmail.</div>

<div class="content">palletguru, Listomni has the best UI of any iphone app imo. It's also the most stable. The only reason I am trying Google tasks for my main list is so I have a backup and can have my list in my face while online. The calendar integration is nice, too. I am really curious to see what kind of syncing they will go with for Listomni. Don't know if I will stick with Google tasks forever. :-)</div>

<div class="content">How are people dealing with the fact that only due dates in your "default"/"primary" list show up on Google Calendar?<br><br>Since I set up my "Work AF2" list first (renaming my primary/default list), and my "Home AF2" list second, only due dates that I set on my work list show up in google calendar via the new "Tasks" calendar, which is kind of a problem since if I HAD to make a choice, I'd rather have my home due items show up on my personal calendar.<br><br>I only discovered this after doing all the data entry from my Circa notebook, so now if I want to switch it I have to create a third list, move each item one by one to clear one of the lists, do the swap, and then finish the move from the tertiary list....quite a pain.<br><br>I can avoid this pain if I keep hard-landscape items off of my AF2 lists completely, and manually create them as all-day events on the specific day that they're due, but it would be really nice to be able to use the built-in due date functionality as intended. :-/</div>

<div class="content">Hi Paul,<br><br>I too would like it if all due dates showed on the calendar, but note that it shows due-dates on whatever list is active at the time, not by a default list. If you select AF home the due dates from that list will show. Then when you select  AF  Work, those due dates pop up and replace the home ones.

<div class="content">vegheadjones,<br><br>Ahh, good catch...I didn't notice that.  That's certainly better than one of the lists being "magic."  Unfortunately, that only seems to work when you open Tasks from within Calendar though (which is too narrow to use all the time for me)...I currently use Tasks in Firefox's sidebar so that it's always open no matter which web page I'm on, and so that I can widen the list as necessary to reduce wrapping and make my list more readable.  However, it's not the end of the world if I have to go into Calendar's Tasks and switch the list twice per day in order to have the most-relevant due dates showing depending on whether I'm at home or at work.  Would be nice to see both at once, but I can kind of understand the limitation from their end.</div>

<div class="content">Mike,<br><br>I tried to monkey with it, and unfortunately I'm coming up with a blank. If you can obtain a .prn file, then you can edit it - .prn is a space delimited text file, which can be easily tweaked in Excel. I could not, however, get a .prn file from Google Calendar. <br><br>I know there are a variety of programs available that will synchronize Google Calendar with Outlook - also I seemed to read somewhere that the later versions of Outlook can subscribe to .ics files? Once the calendar is in Outlook you should be able to get it into OneNote (or Excel) to slice and dice it into the compact agenda you're looking for. You can setup a macro to streamline this process if necessary.<br><br>That's about all I could figure out. Hope it helps.<br><br>-palletguru</div>

I did not know that .PRN was in any way editable.  Great!<br><br>What a shame that they make us jump through so many hoops.

<div class="content">I am really enjoying Google Tasks. I don't plan to switch to the combo method. I keep my associated lists in Listomni and I am being very strict about dismissing subtasks. For example, I have Organize on my Google AF2 list. I have a huge list of organizing tasks in Listomni. I put the last one on this list as a subtask under Organize today. If I organize today but don't do this subtask, it gets added to the general dismissal pile. In a very short time, I should have a list of only tasks that I really want to do any time soon. Eventually I may be able to manage these associated lists as in AF2. In other words, I will dismiss blocks. But for now most of the lists are continuous blocks anyway. I DO look forward to an onboard app for working with Google tasks.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>I am sure it is possible to set up the pages the way you described (and feel a tad silly that I had not thought of that, I was trying to replicate the exact number of lines that my favorite speckled composition notebook had) but I should note that google tasks has windows of two different sizes, the full screen when you open it independently and the small pop up in gmail and google calendar. <br><br>I am happy to be back on paper. I left paper in 2001 when I set up a complicated context, priority, project model in Outlook. AF1 was a revelation in simplicity and worked really well on paper. I really enjoyed flipping through the closed lists.  I got a bit discouraged though using paper on AF2. I was in a hectic period at work where I kept adding (and actioning) on items at the end, but never getting to anything in the middle. I ended up with 30 pages of items which kind of freaked me out, and the single continuous backward motion of flipping was not much fun so I moved  to an electronic AF list.<br><br>But so far so good back on paper. AF2 is needed for me at my fast changing work environment, but when it is time to go to AF1 (per the switch action standing out) I can flip more leisurely again enjoying paper. I likes it!</div>

<div class="content">As someone who is totally bereft without my PC I continue to be amazed at how easily I use AF with a paper notebook and no compulsion to be totally digital.  I do maintain a digital version in OneNote which gives some advantages but mainly because it exactly mirrors my paper notebook.  In fact if anything AF has encouraged me to start using paper more for other things that I have always tried to adapt digitally.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine, same here. With other systems I was always trying different digital implementations of them, and never being completely satisfied with either a digital or a paper version. Since I'm using Autofocus, I've had the urge to try digital only once, and after 5 minutes of tinkering already realised that I like paper much better. There is something about crossing off a task and flipping through half-completed pages that can't be beat by a tickmark on a computer screen.</div>

But perhaps you will understand even better why I can't use paper in a house with 6 kids where absolutely everything disappears. Yesterday it was the mouse for my laptop. Twice it disappeared.

<div class="content">Google Tasks, like Taskpaper is very similar to working off of a notebook - and for someone who is always in front of the computer during my work day, but also dashes off to meetings, it's very handy to always have my list accessible via iPhone or my Firefox sidebar. I also have two energetic kiddos at home, so I know where Mel is coming from!<br><br>I have used Autofocus in paper form on my Moleskine for quite some time, but since so many of my tasks are initiated from email, or reference files that have been emailed to me, Google Tasks' ability to pull these emails from Gmail into the task list is necessary with how I work.<br><br>For Mark's latest Autofocus instructions, I work normally in "Reverse" as descibed, then in "Forward Mode" I work off the sidebar and use page up/down to delineate the "pages" (my firefox is always maximized in the height dimension on my screen, so there are 24-26 tasks visible at any given time).<br><br>Items up for review get indented and moved to my review list.

<div class="content">palletguru, VERYgood concept. You won't believe this, but I've been testing paper all day. I used a notebook for the very first of AF and that's all. SO many people rave about it that I thought I should give it and the new combo method a try before I can be certain I have the best system possible. I am not using any associated lists either. I think it will be interesting! I'm using a smaller notebook that I can easily pop in my purse and carry with me. If I can't get to my notebook (FIND IT lol), I will email myself the task to add. One thing I am doing that I think is a great way to keep from dumping an old list into a new one is added the task, "Choose one task from the old list." That should prevent the constipating blocks from settling into the new list. ;-) <br><br>But as I sit here pallet, I can see my Google tasks list and oooh I love it. LOL I'm going to really give this a go and then I'll be confident as I can be that I'm using the right approach.</div>

<div class="content">How do Google Tasks and Remember the Milk (RTM) compare for implementing the new version of Autofocus?<br><br>I ask, because when I looked up Gears and Tasks after reading this thread, RTM showed up as the online tasks app that supports Gears.   And I've heard some good things about RTM...    <br><br>I haven't used either, and am looking for some good electronic system (that wil sync betw my desktop and laptop and work offline) to use to try out Autofocus...<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">David M,<br><br>I like Evernote (<a href="http://evernote.com)" rel="nofollow">http://evernote.com)</a> for its syncing capabilities. I haven't used it for Autofocus (Moleskine lover here), but it's so flexible I imagine it could be adapted to any system.</div>

<div class="content">I really wanted to like RTM for AF, but it just doesn't work well imo. I know there was at least one person using it, however. It didn't seem like it was a good fit for AF2 at all. Google tasks offers the sync and integration that RTM has, but is very very simple. There are no location aware tasks (which I personally think is major overkill), for example. There are no repeating tasks, no tags, etc. It's just beautifully simplistic for AF, however.</div>

<div class="content">@palletguru<br><<I know there are a variety of programs available that will synchronize Google Calendar with Outlook ><br>><br>I have tried synching Google Calendar with Outlook (using the Calendar sych tool downloaded from Google labs) an d it does offer a 2-way synch or 1-way in either direction between the two apps. However it only operates on the primary calendar - so there's no way to synch a seconday calendar. If you have set up separate Google  calendars (work/home/partner's) then only your primary (topmost) one will be synched with Outlook.<br><br>I've also tried using Google tasks on several occasions with limited success - don't like the fact that only one list at a time can be displayed and the layout of the list (squashed into the right hand side of the screen). How do you display tasks in the sidebar in Firefox?<br><br>At the mo, I've bought (another) shiny new notebook and am back on paper!</div>

<div class="content">Outlook tasks work fine.<br><br>Mark, I miss the electronic version I had with AF1 is when wading through pages with two or three open tasks. It would be nice to filter out the closed tasks. It is a little quicker to create a new task from an incoming mail, and the referencing is a little quicker too, mut the main annoyance is that I DO find the closed tasks get in the way.</div>

<div class="content">I've tried using RTM for Autofocus, but the problem is that you can't see completed and uncompleted tasks in the same view, which makes determining where the dismissal line should go a pain. A workaround could be to create a tag "completed", and only tick off tasks later on, but that didn't feel good either. So I stuck to paper.</div>

<div class="content">Will, I have probably had every chore system ever designed. LOL I paid $ for Chore Wars and didn't use it. Surprisingly enough, I have a chore system that works. I created clusters of chores that then rotate from child to child each day. I also work with one child a week. That way I can see what they're doing wrong and correct it without have to inspect everyone's chores. I used a computer based system that gave each child points for a while. It created big fights as each child wanted to log each chore and cash in points at the same time. UGH. My chart is on paper. :-)</div>

<div class="content">Palletguru,<br><br>I've been trying to learn more about Google Tasks and how it integrates with Calendar.  One problem I've hit is that if I enter "details" they show on the screen but are MIA when I print or look at the list on my phone.  I did not jump on the iPhone bandwagon so am using Win Mobile 6.1 and that may be a limitation.  But not showing up in the printed list?  Surely I am doing something wrong?  Any ideas?</div>

<div class="content">Another question, if I may ;-)<br><br>Is there a way to collapse the subtasks?  IOW if I have<br><br>[] Page 50<br>... [] line 15 Task nn<br>... [] line 14 Task nn<br>[] Page 49<br><br>Can I show just:<br><br>[] Page 50<br>[] Page 49<br><br>I ask because when I get this on the phone, it takes forever to scroll down to the last (i.e. "first" page when going in "forward mode").<br><br>I like the potential here but I'm starting to feel that it is not quite ready for prime time ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Arrrrrg,<br><br>Yet another question.  How do you get rid of completed tasks ... I mean REALLY get rid of them.  I wanted to be able to show/hide completed tasks but when I tried to show completed tasks, I got a list of EVERYTHING I'd deleted when I was experimenting ... even though I clicked "clear completed tasks".  Now that seems odd to me.</div>

<div class="content">Mike I don't think you can show only primary tasks on phone. Clearing completed tasks makes it impossible to determine unactioned blocks. You can't re-show them as I understand it. It does have some drawbacks as you have determined.</div>
