<div class="content">After messing around with various ways to monetize the time management information, I have decided to concentrate on the new site and some other projects and I am making the entire simple time management site free.  This includes the two ebooks.  As I mentioned before, if you paid for the USGTM send me the receipt and I will give you DOIT for free.  Thanks for visiting the sites.<br><br>Gerry<br>www.simple-time-management.com<br>www.desiredoutcomes.info</div>

<div class="content">Hi Gerry<br>I truly hope you find great success in your endeavors.  You've always shown yourself to be a fair-minded and generous guy. And because your philosophies and procedures seem to match some of mine so closely, I also support your various approaches. Like Einstein recommended: As simple as possible but no simpler!

<div class="content">I basically decided the time management stuff was really a separate topic and now quite simply give it away because there is so much free time management stuff and low cost books, that it is hard to make money in the niche unless you really ramp up and do a full blown book.  I personally embrace simplicity and could never write a full book on the topic as I don't think complex systems are needed.  The site does generate traffic and helps sell DOIT, which I think is a more unique product and plays a more important role in my life and hopefully the lives of others.  <br><br>DOIT is still charged for at $12.99, but I added a money back guaranty.  If you do the program and it does get you closer to your goals I refund your money.  I only ask people send me the last page.  I don't mind refunding if people actually do the program.  I don't want to refund for people who "think" it won't work but did not attempt it.  It is the exact program I used to accomplish several important things in my life and was heavily influenced by the Science of Getting Rich.  The same book the Secret crowd discovered.  However, I focused on the action chapters while they focused on the manifesting and attraction parts.  As I have written about, the public is easier sold attraction versus action, it seems more mystical and is less work.  <br><br>One thing I have considered is a beta test like what Mark did where I would ask people to use the program and post their experiences.  However, I am concerned that the program would be "tweaked" and the test would get sidetracked.  But, would love to hear peoples thoughts about the idea of participating.<br><br>Let me  know if you have any questions.  <br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a><br><a href="http://www.desiredoutcomes.info" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.desiredoutcomes.info</a></div>

<div class="content">Alan,<br><br>When I visit a bookstore or Library I get to touch the book, see its length, read a few pages, feel its size, etc. etc. etc.  And I can generally judge if I want to spend hard earned money on them.  Not so with many eBooks that you have to purchase first and then see if it was worth it.  Money back options are great but create hasstle.<br><br>Yes - I buy books.  Yes - I use the Library.<br><br>Gerry provided a very good answer to my very straightforward question.  Thank you Gerry.<br><br>Your response did nothing but get my back up.</div>

<div class="content">Sorry Roger.  Your previous post sounded like you don't buy electronic data only because it's electronic.  Mea culpa.</div>
