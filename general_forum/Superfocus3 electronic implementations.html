<div class="content">Since I am using my iPod touch all the time, and since I can use it with a single hand which make me prefer it than pen and paper for notes on the go, I am trying to implement Superfocus3 electronically and I would like to know if someone has succeeded at this task?<br><br>Before deciding to try SAF3 I was using Omnioutliner which is a software I can recommand for a lot of reasons but it seems difficult to implement SAF3 inside. If it was possible it would be the best but since I didn't find a practical way to do it I am trying now to use Taskpaper, creating a project for each page, inside which I create 2 projects, for left page and right page. And I try to keep less than 30 actions in each. Since this is not automated it is cumbersome but is the best solution I found until now.<br>I name the pages@ work or @home or whatever context they are about.<br>I'll report if it works or not.</div>

<div class="content">@ Isd I red someone did something like that with two sheets of paper. One was general list i guess and the other was urgent and unfinished. Taskpaper is great but the iphone app is medium it would be better on an ipad. You may use tags to such as keeping project and use @General  @urgent and unfinished but the result wil be tha you will not follow the rules ie not going to the next page until the current C2 is over. <br><br>May be it would be better to do it with a simple text editor such as macintosh page and 2 columns sync on your ipad, your iphone and your mac or more simple use google doc. <br><br>Of course I also like the iphone note app. Even if it is more difficult to cross tasks and i dont know how i could highline tasks. Any way for me it is much faster to do it on paper with a pocket note book using the left page for C1 and the right page for C2. But I will follow with interest your post even if i find that putting stuff on a computer cut my intuition.</div>

<div class="content">I did a try just for fun about a few task with 2 column tab on google doc<br>on the mac it is pleasant. The searching is great and fast<br>but on the iphone it is terrible. The tab are not respected so there is a full mixup of urgent and unfinished task. But there was an advantage of doing this, it clarified my list and there is 1 page instead of 5.</div>

<div class="content">For what it's worth I'm using OneNote, one page per task, one section per SF page and striving to follow the rules as close as practical. Because there's no crossing out, only moving or deleting, it's a bit fuzzy. But it seems to work. I use a '-' page to represent a division between columns.</div>

<div class="content">The Day the new rules were released, I had access to computer, but no paper (!). <br><br>I set up a two-column table in Apple's Pages (any word processor), and followed the rules exactly, including respecting the notion of individual pages. I have since switched to paper, but keep that file open on my computer to jot ideas that come to me while on the computer.</div>

<div class="content">I am effectively Looking for a method on ipod touch/iphone because I can use it anywhere. I can't use the ipad or computer as easily (imagine a train full of people and nowhere to sit, I am in this situation more than 1 hour per day and need to make it productive).<br><br>I have modified slightly my use of taskpaper but for have tried a lot of different applications and event some very good text editors (like iText Pad) taskpaper is still the est choice I think, for the following reasons;<br>-you can CROSS tasks and even uncross them, and they stay crossed on the page, like on paper.<br>-you can use tags but you're not forces to. I am mainly using tags for home and work contexts for the moment ( so I stopped using full pages for these contexts, which was cumbersome. And now I write all the page on the same sheet of taskpaper so I can easily use home and work tags)<br><br>So, well for the moment the only drawback is that I have to count the number of tasks for deciding when I should write on the next page.<br><br>And I guss te next big problem I will have would be the same on paper : should I live with this SAF list or choose time blocks to work on it? Outside these time blocks I would do whatever I want, and I would call this "real" free time?</div>

<div class="content">No way for me. Task paper doesnt suit to me i dont like the way it works for this. Google doc is much better or every text editor like .page. But for me there are only two way for the moment PAPER or PAPER. If I reconize i could work on a text editor I prefer paper as i already said digital cut my intuition;</div>

<div class="content">I've been using a spreadsheet on Office (but any spreadsheet program should work).<br><br>I use one sheet for my SF3 tasks. I can easily read about 20 lines on a sheet at a time on my iPod or any computer I might use Google Docs on, so I have "pages" of 20 entries each. <br><br>I set my column widths so I can see two columns at any time--this is the C1 & C2 for a page. I put a header row in at the top to say Page1 1b Page 2 2b so I can keep track of what page I'm on. I scroll to the side to get to the next page--it's quicker than switching sheets, although that would work too.<br><br>When I work on a task, to mark it completed I change the alignment to Right Align (for some reason Office doesn't have strikethrough. Other spreadsheets might). If it wasn't completed & needs to go into column 2 of the next page or if it's a recurring task that needs to go to the end of the list (eg the new daily habits I'm trying to form) I copy it (before I change the alignment) and paste it wherever it needs to go.<br><br>I use other pages when I have a project that requires more info (tasks that I don't want to forget but aren't ready to be done, my iPod book reading rotation (to mix fun and hard reading), etc...) Some of those pages are entered with project names in the SF3 list and I go to that page when I see the name and others serve as feeder lists.  I mark the column header of the page I'm on in bold since Office doesn't keep that steady if you switch sheets.<br><br>I haven't had to dismiss a page yet, but if I did I would change the fill of those two columns to some bright color.<br><br>One problem with working in Office on an iPod is trying to change large numbers of cells at once. Luckily, it's easy enough to switch over to Google Docs and do that type of editing there.<br><br>I'm at 5 active pages right now. 2 are down to less than 5 tasks in C1. I think that getting very many more might be difficult. I may wind up deleting all the completed tasks and consolidating my active columns at some point soon, just to avoid having 10 pages with most having less than a quarter of the tasks active. <br><br>So long as I follow the rules, this works much better than any other of Mark's systems that I've tried (before this, the best for me was DWM). The hard part, of course, is making myself follow the rules :)</div>

<div class="content">I tried a setup in Evernote that put a 25x2 table on a page with spaces at the top to indicate when the page was opened, dismissed, and closed.  It was lovely, because Evernote lets you even put in tickboxes and everything.<br><br>But rich text Evernote notes are not editable in the iOS version of the app.  So that was a colossal failure.<br><br>In another thread, someone said that they had implemented it in Toodledo and just made column 1 tasks low priority and column 2 tasks medium priority.  That's how I'm doing it right now - I have a folder for each page (the only annoying part is that you have to manually keep track of how many total items are in the folder, there's nothing to  force you onto the next "page") and I sort first by priority and then by date added.  The flow isn't great but I'm getting used to it.  I'm certainly moving things along that would have languished on page W of DWM for seven days at a time, only to get worked on and then neglected for another week.</div>

<div class="content">@jupiter<br>I don't highlight because the remaining tasks are more easily seen than on paper, <br>And for dismissing I intend to put a sign on the page number, like in the paper version with a O for dismissed pages and a × for pages without items to review.</div>

<div class="content">If you do it on a spreadsheet The ideal system is numbers for macintosh because you can categorize the colums and open each page or close it<br>Then C1 (colums one) is in A<br>C2 is in B<br>and in c you just put a number 1 for page one, in front of each task,  2 for page 2, 3 for page 3 and so on <br>so when you categorize you have the all list per page on one screen<br>Bt for the iphone you will need numbers and dido for the Ipad... 7 € </div>

<div class="content">@isd:<br><br>The app I use (Office^2) is made by the same people as the one you chose--it does docs as well as spreadsheets. <br><br>@Jupiter<br>I thought about scrolling the pages vertically too, but decided that I was happier with a horizontal scroll. Numbers for my iPod would be nice since I use a Mac at home, but it does get expensive!<br><br>-----<br>I did go through my list yesterday and cull the crossed out tasks so I could start from a shorter, clean list again.  It served as a bit of a weekly review, as I found myself looking at the tasks again to determine if they really needed to be there or if I could word them better.  Basically going through what Mark does after he dismisses tasks without getting hung up on the terminology.</div>

<div class="content">Here is now how look my SAF3 lists.<br><br><a href="http://img713.imageshack.us/i/saf3explanation.jpg/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://img713.imageshack.us/i/saf3explanation.jpg/</a><br><br>The red numbers 1,2,3,4 represent 2 pages of SAF3(in fact since I started yesterday there are only 2 of them).<br>The colums not numbered are just there to put space between the pages.<br>I decided to work with 30 rows.<br><br>1 is the column 1 of the LAST page (I add new pages at the left of the sheet)<br>2 is the column 2 of the LAST page.<br>3 is the column 1 of the previous page(in this case the first)<br>4 is the column 2 of the previous page.<br><br>As you can see I don't have so much urgent actions for the moment, <br>but as you can see on the bottom left the green numbers 1 and 2, I have 2 worksheets, one for work and one for everything else.<br><br>I put in bold the point where I am, and since the application I use don't allow me to change the color easily I put borders on finished items (in the future I hope to find an app on which I can change the color with one touch).<br><br>I decided to work with the list but not let it be dictatorial, so at some point I may naturally do things I have written somewhere on it, without have reached the point or event knowing where it is (then I cross them out when I go through them on the list). This way I can do a task when I feel it to be done, and I have the list to backup me if I forget (I am not sur this is a good way to work with AF but I am willing to experiment. So I am still the master and the list is here to help me not the opposite).<br><br>I also read every task in its entirety when I go through the list. I realized I wanted to go to fast most of the time since I am using AF, so I slowed and I can trust the system better, and feel better.<br><br><br>@jessica<br><br>Sheet2 is not bad but doesn't have autosave and I lost data when it crashed so I am looking for an alternative if there is.</div>

<div class="content">Since the pages of my list are browsed from right to left, it feeled more natural to put the column 2 on the left, so I did it. That's all, if someone wants to use right-left orientation also I suggest you do the same ;)</div>

<div class="content">Will - Looks great.  I was just using each day as a page, flagging each new task with deadline=today.  This made for variable-length pages.  I like your approach better.<br><br>Within each due-date group, I sort by priority, so all the column2 items are grouped together at the end.  They are also colorized to make them stand out.<br><br>For me, the hardest thing to do in Outlook is handling when column 2 fills up and forces you to complete the whole page (action or dismiss everything in column1, action everything in column2).   I've been finding this to be a key dynamic in the paper-based version, but it's pretty difficult to implement.  You seem to be doing this with filters -- you keep a clean list with all your active tasks, and all the completed tasks hidden, as your default view (shown in your screenshot), but you have other filtered views to show you all the completed items or other pertinent data.  Can you share a screenshot of a view that shows column2 filling up with completed tasks?<br><br>Thanks!</div>

<div class="content">I am stupid.<br>I thought SAF could not be implemented in Omnifocus because when you complete a task it disappears, but you can choose in the option to display all the tasks (and the completed tasks as well, crossed out). So this is what I did, and I will from now write my SAF lists in Omnifocus(which is fast and so practical to use. And it is then easier to enjoy the "little and often" goodness).<br><br>My method is simple:<br><br>Create a folder Superfocus<br>Create a project by page<br><br> *I name the pages in reverse number (page99, page 98, etc.. so the last active page, which is always the entry point, appears on top of the incremental search, as well as on the projects list)<br><br>This is all the structure needed<br><br>The process is as follows :<br>-Column 1 task entry<br>   Simply enter new tasks in the most recent project<br>-Column 2 task entry<br>   Enter task with a due date of yesterday (it is then highlighted)<br><br>Thats's all.<br>The number of normal tasks and overdue tasks are automatically diplayed under the project name so you know easily when you reach 25.<br><br>People with a mac can create fancy perspectives to display in the order they like.</div>

<div class="content">@ Erik Ouaouh Erik seems nice ! advantage of paper and dgital without inconvenient ? <br><br>@ Isd Omnifocus <br>If you put tasks entry in colums 1 ie tasks it's ok<br>But for urgent and unfinished (context) you will have to create a new context as a task each time. <br>I guess it would me easier to create the pages by folders as you do <br>and the to create 2 contexts <br>One would be "Current"<br>The other would be "Urgent & unfinished". <br>Then you make a sort by context and project, and follow the rules. <br><br><br>Would you do a picture of it ?

<div class="content">Using omnifocus<br><br>Yes, there is a problem with using the due date (and the flag also, since I use it for something else out of SAF)<br><br>I resolved the problem as follows :<br><br>I have a project by COLUMN!<br><br>and a folder by CONTEXT (work/home/everything else)<br><br>Here is the structure<br><br>Folder 1 (things I can do everywhere)<br> Page 99 a (project/SAF column 1)<br> Page 99 b (project/SAF column 2)<br> Page 98 a (project/SAF column 1)<br> Page 98 b (project/SAF column 2)<br><br>Folder 2 (home context)<br> Page 99home a (project/SAF column 1)<br> Page 99home b (project/SAF column 2)<br><br>Folder 3 (work context)<br> Page 99work a (project/SAF column 1)<br> Page 99work b (project/SAF column 2)<br><br>That is all.<br>And the WONDERFUL thing you can do with omnifocus when you enter a folder, is clicking on the upper row "Display all actions" and you have all your pages one after another on a big list(and with pages titles inbetween!), this is great! You can browse the list quickly or slowly one action after another (thanks to the great features of OF), the last one beeing very adapted to the AF method I think.<br><br>The only problem is ot mark where I stopped, but since I don't track my progress on a single page, I work with pages blocks, i just note the current page somewhere.<br>I like the libery of working by blocks, and anyway you should have the same results if you follow the rules since you should make sure no action stands out before turning the page.<br>I will try to mark the whole project overdue (then highlight the page) to mark the current page, it may be nice since the number of remaining tasks also display then.<br><br>I think I will continue to look if I can make SAF with omnifocus even easier to use.</div>

<div class="content">sabre23t:<br><br>The problem with user scripts is of course that they only work in some desktop browsers. So whatever improvements they bring won't be available in apps and mobile browsers. Also, they will break everytime the host platform changes something.<br><br>That being said, if you have something specific in mind, I probably can throw something together. :-)</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the offer Andreas. ;-)<br>One thing I'm finding a bit tedious in TDD/SFv3 is reentering recurring tasks that I have loads of. I need to change page number, change task number and clear the current task star. Is that clear enough?</div>
