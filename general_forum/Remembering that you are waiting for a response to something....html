<div class="content">Hi all,<br><br>Been through the forum and couldn't see this obviously anywhere, but feel free to post a link if this question has already been answered...<br><br>How do you remember to monitor for responses to things from other people? I could do the obvious thing and have it on my list, but when all is said and done, I can't do anything with this until it comes in. If it comes in, fine, I can then deal with it but it might be that I don't get a response for several weeks (which is perfectly valid in some cases), so do I simply dismiss the page if that is the final item, and re-add it to the last page (and do this repeatedly until I get the answer, or decide it's time to chase it)?<br><br>Thanks<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Donna<br><br>My first posting.<br><br>Say I have to send an email and I expect a reply, I would write the email, cross of the original item "Email Fred" and add to the end of the list "Has Fred replied to email?". Then as I look through my lists, one page at a time, I find it's almost invisible to me and I skim past without a second thought, but becomes more obvious when a reply has become overdue in my own mind - without expressly putting a due date against it. Then I know it's time to chase for a reply.<br><br>Regards<br><br>John</div>

<div class="content">Ditto to Johnners.  I have the same 'almost invisible' experience.</div>

<div class="content">Depending on your email system, can you put a copy of the email in your calendar as an appointment reminder? I set mine up about a week (or whatever's reasonable) and forget about it until the reminder pops up.</div>

<div class="content">Donna:<br><br>If you are not expecting a reply for several weeks, then you should put it in your reminder system, not in the list itself. Otherwise a task "John replied to e-mail?" or "Sue provided the figures?" is the best way to handle it.</div>

<div class="content">I discuss it in a few posts.  I used a W with a circle around it when I was doing AF and just left it there as a reminder of how long I was waiting for the item.  Obviously you can use a calendar to schedule the due date.<br><br>I have also used the rule function in outlook so when you type [w] in an email you are sending  it puts a copy in a waiting for folder automatically.  This way when you email and ask someone for something you know a copy will be in the waiting for folder which is easy to review.<br><br>In my E book the Simple Guide to Time Management I identified Waiting for items as one of the key three things to track based on my experiences over the years with various TM systems and suggest a Waiting for list as a part of this simple system.</div>

<div class="content">Gerry:<br><br>Great suggestion about the [w] rule. I tend to forget that I can write rules for outgoing emails as well as incoming ones.</div>

<div class="content">If you are managing a team of people it works really well to put reminders at the end of your list. It has completely solved my previous problem of delegating tasks and then never knowing if they had actually been completed. And it keeps my team on their toes too. <br><br>If you are working on bigger projects, as I do, this approach also helps to keep a paper (or email) trail of where the responsibility for an action lies. A reminder email, judiciously cc'd to relevant persons, works wonders...<br><br>I have to say that AF has completely transformed my efficiency - not just in getting tasks done in a timely manner, but in getting the less important ones done - these are key to creating a good impression with clients and under other systems they drop off the list as they are relatively low importance.</div>

<div class="content">Gerry:<br><br>I've implemented the [w] rule, using my signature block to include the [w] on the principle that it's easier to delete it if I don't want a reply than to remember to include it if I do.<br><br>I've also written a rule that any email received with [w] in the body is copied into the same folder so I can see immediately that it is a "reply received". This works because people usually copy my email in their reply.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>What I used to do was put the [w] in the subject line manually instead of all emails, this avoids another email place that is just a copy of the sent file reducing the waiting to just that.  Additionally it had another positive benefit because people would ask what the [w] meant and I would let them know it was an indicator that I was awaiting a response from them.  People got trained and responded quickly.<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">Just wanted to say that the [w] system is working brilliantly. Thanks, Gerry.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>You are welcome, I wish I could say I invented it, it may have actually come from a GTD site.  It does fall into the simple but effective category.</div>

<div class="content">There is also a handy way to do this In Google Mail:<br><br>If you have the "labs" feature activated (settings), you can select custom "stars" to tag your email. For example, I have a red star for everything I have to respond to or do something, and the "orange-guillemet" (looks like ">>") whenever I am waiting for a response. <br><br>Then, I set up "quick links" (another labs feature) in the left pane for "waiting for". The quick link is basically a search for "has:orange-guillemet". I did the same with the red star ("Has:red-bang"). A nice tip from lifehacker - come to think of it, now all I need is an AF entry to check this "waiting" - list...<br><br></div>

<div class="content">The way I follow up on emails is to blind copy the email to myself.  When it pops back into my Inbox I decide how long it will take them to reply (it will normally be 2 days).  I then have separate folders set up for each day like this:-<br><br>07 Sat<br>08 Sun<br>09 Mon<br><br>I then drag the email to the appropriate folder.  When I'm clearing my email I always check the relevant day folder to see if anything is outstanding.  Often the emails have been answered.  Sometimes they haven't!<br><br>It works really well for me...<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Caroline:<br><br>If you're using Outlook you could just drag the email into the Task folder and set a reminder.<br><br>The advantage of the [w] (or other code) system is that you can set up a rule so that you are notified when a reply arrives (assuming the recipient doesn't delete your code when they reply, that is!)</div>
