<div class="content">Help! I have messy handwriting so it looks messy and spidery.<br><br>Does anyone know where i can find how to write properly (clearly)? it would make a big difference in being able to read what i have written!!! <br><br>I think it is called 'cursive' handwriting or joined-up etc.<br><br>I have created a list of about 30 items and will be adding to it - it is a great relief to 'dump' things on the list so they are all in one place!<br><br>I am enjoying reading all of your posts - they are a tremendous help - unfortunately i keep checking it several times a day - it is addictive!!<br><br>Many thanks<br><br>Nick<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Nick,<br>My husband swears by writing all his note-book stuff in upper case, as it is always more readable: apparently you can get used to doing it very quickly, and he has tiny writing so it definitely helps the readability. Somehow in handwriting, it doesn't look like shouting either, unlike typed text.</div>

<div class="content">I second that, upper case seems clearer somehow.</div>

<div class="content">Hi,<br><br>My writing is terrible so I use upper case and keep the writing small. I'm hoping the increased practice of writing lots of actions will gradually improve my messy scrawl.<br><br>Thanks, Carl</div>

<div class="content">Upper case - that is interesting I haven't tried that - methinks it would take longer?! thanks for replies much appreciated</div>

<div class="content">I find a good pen makes a difference - with a biro my writing looks a mess, but with a nice black gel pen I feel it is more "characterful".</div>

<div class="content">A few years ago I practiced "italic handwriting" for a few minutes every day:<br><br><a href="http://briem.ismennt.is/4/4.1.1a/4.1.1.1.quick.htm" rel="nofollow">http://briem.ismennt.is/4/4.1.1a/4.1.1.1.quick.htm</a><br><a href="http://briem.ismennt.is/4/4.1.2a/4.1.2.01.lc.htm" rel="nofollow">http://briem.ismennt.is/4/4.1.2a/4.1.2.01.lc.htm</a><br><br>Now I use it everywhere, and my handwriting became much more readable.  Sometimes I catch myself writing my signature in italic, and that is not what my bank has on file!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Nick,<br><br>I have the same issue with messy handwriting and was looking on the Internet yesterday for tips (of course I'd reminded myself to do this by adding 'research better handwriting' to my autofocus list the day before!). What I really need is an iPhone version 10 which will recognise my handwriting as fast as I can write and tidy it up for me!<br><br>I came across this article which stresses the need to reduce tension in the fingers and hand which I certainly notice I have. Having done some Alexander Technique lessons recently I'm amazing how much counterproductive tension we hold in our bodies subconsciously, particularly when doing mentally demanding tasks such as playing a musical instrument. As I type now I'm thinking "Neck free!" and it's certainly making my typing more accurate, smooth, and effortless. Perhaps over time it'll do the same for my handwriting.<br><br><a href="http://www.paperpenalia.com/handwriting.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.paperpenalia.com/handwriting.html</a><br><br>Mike<br></div>

<div class="content">Thanks for that Mike - also reminds me how helpful I found the Alexander Technique myself some years ago.  Yet another task - "check out local AT classes" :-)</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Christine. If you're in London in the UK I can recommend a great teacher (not affiliated to me).<br></div>

<div class="content">Mike - many thanks!!<br><br>quote "....if your writing looks as if frenzied chickens got loose on the page" - that is me!<br><br>What  a VERY useful page - it will actually help me to reduce strain in my arms/hands and write better - fantastic.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Mike - unfortunately I'm on the South Coast and having braved the train to London yesterday suspect the stress would undo all the good work :-)  Will have to look closer to home .......</div>
