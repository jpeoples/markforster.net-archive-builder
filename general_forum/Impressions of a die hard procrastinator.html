<div class="content">Hi Mark<br>Thanks for your prompt email and your system (can't believe it's free!)<br>All I can say is WOW!<br>I've been using this system for 2 days now and my productivity has leapt 200 fold!<br>Considering I was not working on much till then,and only making "perfect plans" as a way of procrastination.<br>I have tried many other systems (and boy have I tried them all).This is the real deal for me.<br>I have worked on things I have been resisting for months,and am working up a real appetite for more work!<br>The advantages for me<br>1.Cheap! Uses pen and paper (love the physicality of this-cures me of my addiction to things electronic)<br>2.I know everything in the book is there to access and out of my head<br>3.I have CHOICES of what to do when:the perfect antidote to overplanning which restricts choices and induces procrastination.<br>4.I can start anything I want,at the appropriate time without feeling guilty about not doing something else.<br><br>What I've found useful:<br>I only use it when I actually have time to work on things.<br>The system drives home the point that there's no point beating yourself up about not working on things when you don't have the time to,yet motivates you to start work on  what's important when you do have the time.<br><br>Only one question though<br><br>Is this system a complete departure from "Do it Tomorrow" and "closed lists"? I didn't find those as helpful( though the concepts were brilliant) mainly because I felt I was limiting my choices by closing the list.<br>Is there a way to integrate the two?<br><br>Thanks in advance<br><br>Jay<br></div>

<div class="content">Jay: <br><br>Great to hear all this.<br><br>On the closed lists, Autofocus is really just a series of closed lists, which are dealt with in sequence many times. It gets the advantage of the speed of an open list, with the depth of a closed list.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for that clarification<br>I think the two values this system instils are freedom of choice and discipline(to stick to each page in turn).Seemingly incompatible otherwise but working in harmony in the system.<br>Keep up the great work.<br>I'll post again after I try it out some more<br>Jay</div>
