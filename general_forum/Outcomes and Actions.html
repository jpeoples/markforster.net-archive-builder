<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-07-2 14:27</div>
<div class="content">I'm a longtime GTD-er, and I'm giving AutoFocus2 a try. So far I really like my list, and I'm far more productive than I was when I was constantly scanning various contexts. However, I have a question: is there anywhere in AF where one has a lists of Projects? If you define a project as a desired outcome, with actions being the way to achieve that outcome, then where do you keep that list of outcomes in AF? I'm also used to doing a Weekly Review where I review the list of projects and see if any actions should be added. Does AF do away with this need? Thanks for any insights!</div>

<div class="content">As a recovering long-time GTD-er, I can happily report that you can safely throw out your Projects list as well as the need to think about Next Actions in advance.<br><br>Basically, the AF systems are giant, rotating GTD Inboxes that are processed and organized incrementally as they "spin"...and the reviewing aspect happens constantly.<br><br>And you could say that the GTD Projects list actually blends into the AF list. You can dump those larger project outcomes straight into the AF list and let any necessary actions relating to them surface naturally each time you encounter any of them.<br><br>This violates David Allen's principle of keeping actionable and non-actionable items separate but, nevertheless, it does work quite effectively as you are probably discovering.<br><br>You can also safely ignore the Weekly Review from now on (yippee!) as long as you put any necessary recurring tasks into your AF list to compensate for anything essential to your system maintenance that was there previously - for example, checking past and previous calendar items, working through the incompletion trigger list etc.<br><br>Of course, if you really love Weekly Reviews (I don't know anyone that honestly does), you can still do them but, as I said earlier, there are no more Next Actions or Projects to do housekeeping on so a large chunk of it vanishes.</div>

<div class="content">Well, I've been thinking about ditching my Projects list since starting AF2, but I haven't yet. I may do that soon, but I'll definitely keep my list of Goals, Direction and Values.  No need to review them every week, but every few months I like to take a step back and see if I'm still heading in the right direction.<br><br>About the Weekly Review, I've ditched that right away after starting AF :-). Just putting recurring tasks in AF for checking previous and upcoming calendar dates works great.<br><br>And I still have the WaitingFor list. I was thinking about just putting it in AF, but I'm hesitant to see a lot of yet unactionable tasks in there, so I'm keeping it separate for now.</div>

<div class="content">I am a radical compatibilist who believes that GTD and AF2 are not mutually exclusive. <br><br>In his AF2 instructions, Mark Forster states: <<In general the system is intended to achieve the same sort of things as AF. Just as in AF, no attempt has been made to include a formal project management system. It can be used with any project management system or none.>><br><br>My GTD system has been, for year, the digital application called "Achieve Planner." It's a hierarchical outliner. It contains a list of all my projects. Occasionally, if I think it would help, I also list associated actions under their parent projects.<br><br>With some projects, I know that it is easy for me to lose track of what exactly I have accomplished and what remains to be done. For these projects, I like to have all the project-specific information in one place. Some days, I do not look at this GTD project list at all. Other days, I might look at it three or four times.<br><br>Moment-by-moment I am working off of my AF2 list. <br><br>I like to do a Weekly Review. My Weekly Reviews have never taken much more than 10 minutes. Usually less. So, I don't have a huge resistance to doing them. <br><br>AF2 has a lot more review than AF1 had. I am still adapting to it. In general, I find frequent reviews to be helpful.<br><br>Do you NEED a project list apart from AF2? Obviously, the answer is no, since many people do fine without one. I could imagine that you might merely keep file folders for your more complex projects. In these folders you would include any sketches of project plans that you may have. As soon as you stop work on a project, you write in AF2 the next action or, merely the project name as a reminder to keep working on the project. <br><br>I like having a single list with all my projects on it. My electronic project list obviates the need to have additional folders for most of my projects. <br><br>To sum up: I use AF2 to manage my moment-by-moment activity. Separate from AF2 I keep a list of projects. Very simple projects exist on the AF list only. More complex projects, along with their subprojects, and, sometimes, their actions, are on my project list. This project list was inspired by the GTD work of David Allen. In GTD terminology, the AF2 list is my runway.</div>

<div class="content">Nichole,<br><br>>>>  And I still have the WaitingFor list. I was thinking about just putting it in AF, but I'm hesitant to see a lot of yet unactionable tasks in there, so I'm keeping it separate for now.  <<<<br><br>I have found that I do better keeping a "tickler list" which contains "waiting for" as well as any items with a due date.  SoL<br><br>- Has Geico issued rebate?<br>- Thursdays: Take out the Trash<br>-  4//15/2010 Taxes Due<br><br>One can debate if these could go on the AF list proper, or a calendar, or a tickler list.  I went with the tickler list because I like to see my upcoming TODOs just listed in order due (though I also put them on the calendar to avoid scheduling conflicts).  Some have had luck just seeing them on the AF list, but to me, that clutters up my list.  And what do you do with dismissal rules?  You'd have to suspend them for tickler items, or keep rewriting them at the end of your list each time you see them ... or perhaps once they are marked "on notice".  For me, it is just simpler to think of these things as separate from daily tasks.  My AF list is a TODO list.  Not reminders, warnings, etc.  But that is just me ;-)<br><br>As for implementation, my paper implementation was described elsewhere.  I call it my "EVERY LIST" (i.e. 5 lists of things due every day, week, month, and year ... as well as the true "tickler" or "suspense" or "waiting for" items).  With one quick scan of a well (and cleverly I thought ;-) designed 8x11 page, I can see all repeating and upcoming items.  For "one of" items, I most often just write them on my "every" list where they should come up.  It is all pretty simple minded ;-)</div>

I've always included them in the Autofocus list, in AF1 and AF2. I never thought about it, but I guess I DO treat them a little differently from other items. If I see a waiting-for on a regular pass through the list and I'm happy to still be waiting for it, i leave it alone; if I see it and I want to hassle the person I'm waiting for, I'll do that, cross out the item, and re-enter the waiting-for at the end of the list.<br><br>The dismissal issue, with AF2, is trickier. With AF1, it just never arose. With AF2 so far I have "cheated" and re-entered the waiting-for at the end of the list in order to remove it from a block of actions on notice for dismissal. <br><br>Or maybe it's not cheating, since I did after all accomplish the action of "waiting"...!<br><br>Basically it just doesn't seem to be a problem, while  the psychological benefits of having everything in one place are huge.</div>

<div class="content">Ludlow,<br><br>Another way to have everything in the same place and still seperate is to start working your book "backward".  IOW, start from the last page forward with special "lists" that you want to have handy, want to have AF refer to, but want to be OFF the main list for various reasons.  This way they are available at the flip of the pages.<br><br>So, for example:<br><br>- List of things to talk to wife about (this kind of thing needs to be all together unless you want a fry pan across the skull.  "Hey, you wanted to talk, I'm not just going to stand here while you fuss with your book to find what you want to talk about!"  ;-)<br><br>- List of things to do on the XYZ project.  (Most often I find that I want project things collected in one place.  When I'm ready to so XYZ, I want to see all tasks together and select which to do next.  I will just put "XYZ" in the main AF list and then know to flip to the back of the book to the XYZ list and start working and marking off.)<br><br>- Tickler items, routines, etc.  (These can just be separate lists in the back of the book.  Doing that is a question of how you think about things.  Sometimes it is better to let AF remind you of things, and sometimes it is best to let AF remind you to look at a list of the things you want to be reminded of.  ;-)<br><br>Just a few random thoughts.</div>

<div class="content">Mary,<br><br>I've been asked before and never seem to be able to get to scanning and finding a way to post and all.  Let me see what I can do.  If nothing else, I can probably still find the original Word document that I used to create the document that I then photocopied (to be filled in).<br><br>I'll put it on my AF2 list!  LOL ;-)</div>

<div class="content">DANG, but that AF2 is FAAAAAST!  ;-)<br><br>In just a few moments I:<br><br>- Found an old Word document (of one version of my sheet)<br>- Decided that Word is brain dead for this application<br>- Copied it to OneNote<br>- Reformatted it<br>- Cleaned it up a bit<br>- And now I'm ready to print it to a PDF of some such thing.<br><br>WoooHooo ;-)  Let me know where I can send a PDF and I'll be happy to do so.  (Well, probably tomorrow sometime.  The cats are marching carrying "I want food" picket signs and SWMBO is about to return from an errand and will have tasks for me that take priority ;-)</div>

<div class="content">I have a hard time ditching a projects list.  I think logical groupings can be useful.  I also think a waiting for list is useful as well.  I am finishing up a new ebook entitled the Ultr-Simple Guide to Time Management which will be done in about a week.  I will post when it is done.<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">If I need a list for a project, that project will usually have other documents and such associated with it. They all go into a folder (physical or on my computer, depending on the project). If there is a clear next action that I want to do, that goes on my AF2 list. When I do that and cross it off, I add another action from the project or, actually most of the time, just "Work on Project X."</div>

What Frank said too was great - esp. about the weekly review - but like Nichole, I think I'll keep a separate list of projects. (Not Waiting For, though - that seems to fit just fine in the AF2 list.) I guess I'm just not sure how having non-actionable items works on an AF list. You'd have to come up with a next action, and then where does the non-action item (the project) go? <br><br>So far, for me, AF2 is a great runway!</div>

<div class="content">Mary, et al (et MANY al ;-)<br><br>I just uploaded my EVERY sheet to Mel's Yahoo group.  If someone can't get to it that way, please let me know and we'll figure something else out.<br><br>Please treat this sheet as just an idea about what might work for you.  This worked for ME.  You might have many other ideas to make it fit your style.<br><br>Also, if you do make your own, I'd use something at least as powerful as Word so you can tweak the formatting to make everything fit and be readable.  This really works best if it is kept on ONE page so it is always in view.  I had it punched and in the front of my 3-ring binder and paper clipped to my first tabbed divider so it was always instantly visible and I could get back to it instantly when someone said: "Hey, let's have a meeting on this next Tuesday."<br><br>I don't remember how often I reprinted it.  I'd mostly update it in pen and seldom reprint as changes to this kind of thing are not very frequent.<br><br>Another custom sheet I used was a bi-weekly calendar.  I forgot who I stole this idea from ;-) but it is basically two columns headed:<br><br>THIS WEEK         NEXT WEEK<br>(W/E: mm/dd/yy)  (W/E: mm/dd/yy)<br><br>M<br><br>T<br><br>W<br><br>T<br><br>F<br><br>S<br><br>S<br><br>It kept the two crucial time periods in view at all times and had plenty of room to write on it.  I'd start a fresh copy every week, copying over "next week" to "this week".  That time horizon seems to be what I needed to keep in view.  I had it punched and clipped to a tabbed divider as well so I could see those two sheets together to manage any short term scheduling issue.  Beyond two weeks, I went to a normal calendar.<br><br>Anyway, I hope you enjoy and please feel free to ask if you have questions.</div>
