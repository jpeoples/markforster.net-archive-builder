<div class="content">Hi everyone, <br><br>the biggest difficulty I have with AF (I prefer AF2) is knowing when I've done 'enough' for the day. That's what I really liked about DIT. I have difficulty working to a stop time as my daily schedule varies. <br><br>I am REALLY struggling with procrastination at the moment and am thinking of setting a daily task limit with AF - e.g. just starting off with 6 tasks to work on for the day and building up from there as things improve.<br><br>Would this work against the  design and intentions of AF? Have others already tried this and found it helpful / unhelpful?  Any comments would be appreciated! <br><br></div>

<div class="content">Leon:<br><br>It's difficult to answer your question without knowing a bit more about how your procrastination is manifesting itself. Can you give some more details?<br><br>Pending your answer, I would say that most people (including myself) have found that the answer to procrastination is the opposite of what you have suggested. By putting the activities which you use to procrastinate on the list, you tame them.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>I really don't get how putting them on the list helps ... but I know that it somehow does.  So far as I can see, just seeing the item in writing makes one think about it.  Then thinking about it gives the mental space to consider if it is something that SHOULD be done, in comparison to the other things written there.  I'm sure there is more to it but that does indeed seem to be enough.  Kind of like when you say you're going to the fridge for that last slice of chocolate cake (the third for the night ;-) and the wife says: "Going to have cake, huh?"  No argument or criticism ... just having it hanging in the air like that is enough to get you to reconsider ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Leon, I had problems in the first few months of doing AF because I was so darn tired all the time.  I set a rule for myself that I only had to do 3 things from the list when I got home - just whatever stood out - no judgment if it was easy or hard.  Many times, I would surprise myself by getting involved with the list and keep going, but sometimes I wouldn't and it was ok since I had met my goal.   <br><br>I worked myself out of that funk, but have still reverted back to it some days when I come home from walking the dog and just want to flake out with a book or in front of the computer - so don't be surprised if you revert back on occasion.  Fortunately those periods don't seem to last as long for me anymore (a couple of days), whereas before AF they could go on for months / years and lead to major depression.  <br></div>

<div class="content">>> I really don't get how putting them on the list helps ... but I know that it somehow does.<br><br>Perhaps it's because so many of our decisions (particularly when we procrastinate) are made unconsciously. Knee-jerk, mindless websurfing is  an activity, usually triggered by anxiety or unpleasant emotional state. AF provides a number of tools to increase mindfulness, and helpful guilt, vis-a-vis procrastination. <br><br>1) You need to stop and consider your next action/activity. <br>2) You write it down<br>3) You engage in the activity with full awareness (because of step 1 and 2) of what you're doing<br><br>Now, the above isn't a panacea for a career you hate, an abusive relationship or a methamphetamine addiction. But it can serve as a catalyst to reconsider how you're living your life. And in my line of work, self-reflection is the first step towards change.</div>

<div class="content">I have been know to put "Veg out in front of tv" or "Surf the web mindlessly" on my list. Somehow it makes those activities more purposeful and legitimate so that they are less compulsive and guilt-inducing.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks everyone for your support so far, it is appreciated:)<br><br>Mark, I think my procrastination is coming from feeling overwhelmed and possibly rebellious about all the things that seem to need doing both at home and work. I am finding it very difficult to focus on tasks as I worry about the other tasks that are not getting done.I also feel indecisive about *what* I want to do with my life - I always struggled with the Covey 7 habits top down approach.<br><br> I have very little discretionary time at home because we have two very young children, so I get frustrated as things don't move on. A lot of the tasks I am frankly bored of doing (especially at work) and / or miffed about *having to do*. I'm probably quite de-motivated generally at the moment. <br><br>My procrastination manifests itself largely by surfing the net and reading about and trying different time management systems, ironic as that sounds. I must have switched systems literally 20 times this year already! <br><br>Sorry for rambling, I would say my biggest procrastination issues are feeling overwhelmed, boring/resistant tasks, a lack of focus.</div>

<div class="content">Leon:<br><br>Like you, I am someone who can switch from one system to another over and over again. But I usually find that eventually some sort of resolution comes. But for that to happen it's important to look in the right place.<br><br>Being overwhelmed by boring tasks is a classic symptom of being out of "the flow". In his book "Flow" Mihály Csíkszentmihály says that flow occurs when one's work is challenging but not overwhelming. This means that you need to increase the challenge of your work and reduce the quantity. How you could achieve that of course only you can tell.</div>

<div class="content">Leon, I know how you feel and I've been there and done that.  I wish there was some magic productivity wand that we could wave to get over this - I think AF is as close to that wand as it's possible to get - particularly if you let yourself ease into it.  It has worked especially well for me in dealing with overwhelm - something I didn't realize I was so susceptible to, boring tasks - which I used to avoid but now blast through as fast as I can and/or set myself a super low standard for completion and obviously resistance.    <br><br>In the early days of AF, I could see my list growing and growing and just seeming like an endless work, work, and more work cycle.  It was overwhelming, and setting deadlines for yourself where you think things have to move along at a certain pace or be a certain way just makes it worse.  I had to set some limits for myself so I wouldn't end up giving up on the system and giving up on myself too.  At times, the little amount that I could make myself do was still better than the absolutely nothing that I was doing before that in some areas due to resistance.  <br><br>In hindsight, I'm glad I had that difficult time to do some analysis on what worked and what didn't, how I was sabotaging the system and how I could tweak myself to work better with it.  I wish I wouldn't have been as down on myself though.  <br><br>Re. your job, I really enjoyed Clay Collins' writing when he was blogging.  Here are a couple of articles that I remembered which I thought might be applicable to your situation:<br><br><a href="http://thegrowinglife.com/2008/05/the-alternative-productivity-manifesto/" rel="nofollow">http://thegrowinglife.com/2008/05/the-alternative-productivity-manifesto/</a><br><br>"#24 Productivity is often a necessary evil: if you dislike your job, you’re going to need a water-tight productivity system in place to keep you on task." <br><br><a href="http://thegrowinglife.com/2008/02/the-mind-like-water-myth-a-dialog-between-bruce-lee-a-productivity-guru-and-others/#more-70" rel="nofollow">http://thegrowinglife.com/2008/02/the-mind-like-water-myth-a-dialog-between-bruce-lee-a-productivity-guru-and-others/#more-70</a><br><br>I struggled with the whole "top down / find a purpose" type of questions for over 10 years.   Once I got the right job environment (boss and team) figured out and hopped around a bit, progressively finding better work environments for me, I didn't really care so much about a "grand purpose" since I was enjoying myself every day, feeling like my best productive self (reworking the whole self-concept) and looking forward to Monday more than Saturday.  It wasn't the work itself that ended up being the real issue - and it wasn't really me either.  <br><br>I do wish you the best of luck, and hope you find *your* answers.<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Leon<br><br>I can really second what Jacqueline says above about overwhelm and the way AF enables you to identify what the issues are that are going on in your life.  One of the things I found was that I always had this big black amorphous clod hanging over me of "things to do".  That cloud caused immense stress and anxiety, but largely because it was unknown - the fear of what could be lurking within.  With AF, although my list grew quickly, the impact of having everything written down in one pace, and a genuine system to address everything, was that "magic productivity wand".  I found I could cope with the fact that I had 397 things to do which were all listed and "known" in a way that I could not cope with "lots of things to do".  The amount to do was irrelevant - it was the identification that was the key for me.</div>

<div class="content">Hi again Leon<br><br>just a further observation - it is important to identify what motivates you as far as productivity is concerned.  For me it is knowing I am making progress, so statistics or just thae pages of completed tasks, are a motivator for me.  Consequently, I find that once I start AF and get a few tasks out of the way (and don't be afraid to add something simple like "make coffee" or "switch PC on" onto your list) then the desire to complete more and more gets stronger.    Good luck!!</div>

<div class="content">M, J, C: Thank you very much for your kind words of support. <br><br>Christine: I have tried some sort of data tracking in a bid to motivate myself. The most recent incarnation being logging the number of task 'starts' I made each day. The problem with this is that it doesn't neccessarily corelate with being effective or feeling satisfied. <br><br>For example it is possible to complete many small easy tasks in a day but these may not be of a high value or that important. Another problem is that I seem to have many half cooked projects that are basicaly lingering around - which can be also de-motivating. <br><br>Would you mind me asking how you record data and how you interpret it? I think I'd maybe be looking for more 'completion-centric' evidence, if that makes any sense. <br><br>Thanks again.</div>

<div class="content">As someone struggling to make AF work for myself, this suggestion may not be worth very much, but, suppose you make this an item on your list?  eg add "Stop work for the day' and then stop work when this item stands out.  IOW allow your intuition to tell you when you have done a day's work.<br><br>HTH<br><br>acedia</div>

<div class="content">Leon, you said:<br><br>"it is possible to complete many small easy tasks in a day but these may not be of a high value or that important."<br><br>I'd look at my task phrasing very closely if you find this happening.  One of the keys to getting those larger, high value tasks done (if you resist them) is to break them down enough so that they are as easy to do as one that's easy just by the nature of the task.  I've done this both on-list and off-list as a checklist.  At work, I have fairly large projects on my list and I tend to use checklists off-list a lot, more to clarify my thinking of how I want to approach doing the project but the process of writing it also gets you absorbed in that project and somehow wanting to finish it off (like you want to pick up everything on your grocery list because you don't want to go back to the store).  Half the time, I abandon the checklist part way through and just keep on working and don't even realize I've done so, but it's served its purpose.  Breaking the projects down within the list doesn't work well for me at work, but works very well at home for some reason.  <br><br>Part of the beauty of AF is that (if they're on your list - and they are on your list, aren't they?) you eventually *have* to finish those projects - or say that you aren't going to do them.  So try tweaking your list with phrasing, granularity, even structure of what goes on the list or tweaking yourself, but don't tweak the system.<br><br>The one thing that I have missed in doing AF because I've worked so "little and often" is that it doesn't feel sometimes like I've even done a project.  Back when I renovated my last house, I would put in 8 hour days doing a major project and finish in a day or a weekend where now I'm working on renovating a bathroom almost daily and it's sometimes hard to see the accomplishment (and that's a visible project - it's even more true when it's not so visible at work like developing system improvements).  But the truth is that I had to push myself pretty hard to put in those 8 hour days and now I don't really have to push myself at all.  <br><br>If you don't know when to stop for the day, try adopting something like Neil Fiore's "Unschedule" and book yourself an imaginary appointment to watch that movie at 8 p.m. with your wife.  Or stop when it's time to put your kids to bed and the rest of the night is free.   Unless you have an odd work schedule, the stop time for work is when you leave to go home, isn't it?  If you're self employed or work at home, you can set yourself a stop time of 5 p.m. I would think?<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Leon: the truth is that I never have a problem with stopping work, quite the opposite, in fact!  But I may start adding 'stop work' as an item on my list, so as to stop myself from stopping work too soon ... if you see what I mean.<br><br>This follows the same principle as adding items such as 'take a break', 'surf the net', 'veg out in front of tv', which other people have mentioned in the past.<br><br>Putting this on the list should allow one's intuition to regulate the decision when to stop work, whether the problem is with working too long or stopping too soon.  I find the intuitive side of AF quite difficult, so I am looking for ways to improve that.<br><br>all the best,<br><br>acedia</div>

<div class="content">Hi Leon<br><br>Apologies for the delay in getting back to you - I've gotten a bit behind with the forum the past few days.<br><br>I'll be happy to send you a copy of my spreadsheet if you want to email me at mail[at]meovoto[dot]co[dot]uk <br><br>It does work on the basis of number of tasks completed but also identifies days in which overall numbers have increased or decreased, as well as percentage of tasks actioned.  I know what you mean about "completion" but when you think about it the vast majority of tasks are not actually one off's but require repeat entry.  One thing AF has taught me is that productivity is not about task completion, but about time being spent on "productive" action.  The very act of putting tasks on your list creates your table of productive actions.  If they turn out not to be necessary, the system will deal with them by review/dismissal.  The more you use AF the more you find that the quality of tasks changes - you end up with a pattern of tasks that - to you - are productive.  The biggest mistake we make - and the reason for a lot of procrastination - is that we see certain essential tasks as "unimportant" and therefore feel that time spent on them is "wasted".  The fact is that it is often those seemingly unimportant tasks that pave the way for the doing of the "important" stuff.<br><br>Hope that helps ...... :-)</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the offer Christine, I'll let you know because I'm trying out a time tracking method at the moment. <br><br>I know what you mean about the seemingly "unimportant" stuff: I spent 2 hours and 51 minutes sorting out a storage unit in my dining room last night that had previously been a real headache. Not a glamorous task but it has made it much easier to do more important associated tasks with much less effort. It's like the old Post Office slogan: the little things that make the big things happen (or something along those lines).</div>
