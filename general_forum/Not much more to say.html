<div class="content">After 15 months of auto focusing, everything has clicked.  AF4R just works.  <br><br>It works smoothly in business management using OneNote, and personal management using loose leaf paper.  The project system (i.e. managing groups of connected tasks)  is working smoothly within AF4R.<br><br>I feel a strong understanding of what makes AutoFocus tick [I've written several posts on the topic], and can instantly adapt AF4R to urgent pressure, to catching up neglected things, or to ordinary situations.<br><br>There remain a couple topics concerning household management that bear discussion, but as for task management, I feel the problem is solved.  <br><br>I'll stick around, share my answers to questions, look forward especially to future posts by Mark, but feel no more urge to consider new variants on these systems.</div>

<div class="content">Alan,<br><br>I feel the same way about my "Flagged Tasks" AF1. For me, AF1 was the best system of Mark's, but I had just one little problem with it that I solved to my satisfaction by Flagging Tasks at the beginning of the day and cycling through them AF1 style until they were done. Then, after the flagged tasks were done, I would go back to regular AF1. It's been working like a charm now for quite a while. There's nothing I wish it would do, so I don't feel a need to experiment any further.<br><br>Matt</div>

<div class="content">Alan:<br><br>To save searching back through multiple posts, could you just sum up the changes and additions (if any) which you have made to AF4R as written in the rules ( <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1325521" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1325521</a> ) ?</div>

<div class="content">I think the only change is (a) processing order, (b) loose leaf (movable) pages , and (c) adding project pages.  But here's the details, you might consider other things to be different.<br><br>First, I find Unfinished is more accurately called Active.  <br><br>Processing order: Recurring, scheduled (once), Old (once), New (once), Active (repeated), then back to recurring.<br><br>Notes:<br>When I visit the recurring, scheduled pages, I move tasks for the day to Active.<br>My project pages (groups of related tasks) are labeled with tabs so I can see them all at a glance.  A project is treated exactly like any other task.<br>Active, Old, and New each include both tasks and project pages.<br>Active includes stuff I'm working on.  When I'm done (for now), they go back to new or recurring.<br>I follow AF4R dismissal rules for Old/New.<br><br>For tracking progress, every day I write the date on the active page.  As a goal, rather than a rule, I aim to work on or dismiss (to New) everything from previous dates.</div>

AF1 lacked #4.  AF2 lacked #3.  SAF (for me) lacked #1.  ((I was always hung up on whether to move on, or add a new task here, or move on and carry tasks with me.))  AF4R (also Matt's AF1 with flags) has it all.</div>

<div class="content">"Mark:  Has anyone else found a system which works so well for them that they don't feel a need to change at all?"<br><br>SAF for me, almost exactly as you wrote Mark. My one change is to use two pages instead of two columns on one page-- works better for my messy handwriting.</div>

<div class="content">I think AF4R and Flagged Tasks AF1 are very close in productivity. Both have a very slight weakness solved in the other.<br><br>AFR4 is better than Flagged Tasks, because the review time in the morning is quicker.<br>Flagged tasks is simpler by not having the maintenance of separate sections.<br><br>Both are very good.<br><br>For me – given the way my brain works – Flagged Tasks is the only method that silenced the nagging voice that keeps saying, "what pressing task is there on another page that I should be doing while I'm working on this page?" This had been a significant weight – again, because of the way my brain works.</div>

<div class="content">Interesting that people are beginning to find stuff that really works for them. Myself, I'm currently using AF4R as written, except for one small change. I can work on Old, New, Recurring and Unfinished in any order. This seems to make it much more responsive. I haven't been using it long enough yet to know if it's the perfect system (for me).</div>

<div class="content">"My project pages (groups of related tasks) are labeled with tabs so I can see them all at a glance. A project is treated exactly like any other task."<br><br>Alan -<br><br>Just want to make sure I'm understanding...When you identify something that will take multiple actions, you create a project page for it - and record related action there.  The only item for it on your AF4R list is the name of the project, correct?  <br><br>Thanks for sharing!</div>

<div class="content">Thanks to your systems Mark, I too am 100% pleased with mine. While exploring them, it illuminated some very important mechanisms that I needed to understand in action to gain value from them. While I can't say that what I do is recognizable as an offspring of your systems, I see it as such :)</div>

<div class="content">I have been using DWM2 with an unfinished page and I am very pleased. It is perfect right now. However, I thought I had found a perfect system in AF4 back in the day, just to be disproved by DWM, so I am still open to ideas -- although not really trying anything right now. And I am finally re-reading DIT for the wonderful tips there.</div>

<div class="content">I must admit to having *serious* problems sticking to any system and my procrastination is becoming entrenched. <br><br>I'm spending nearly all my time thinking about different systems and am changing my mind often 2-3 times a day and this is wreaking havoc with my commitments.<br><br>I've currently got several personal issues going on so I suspect it's a form of distraction for me. <br><br>Of all the systems I have tried I have found AF4 to be the most flexible and responsive in meeting my requiremens. I really like the flag idea. It would be very useful for me as I like to select one key task to complete in a day that I need to revisit several times, so thank you 2mc for that idea. <br><br>I've pulled out a dirt cheap steno reporters type notepad (front for work, back for home). And I 've drawn 30 boxes on the card back to colour in every day as I basically need to stick with one system.</div>

<div class="content">Scott, <br><br>It's not simply that multiple actions will occur. It's when I have already entered several related activities that I pull them together onto a separate page. It could be housekeeping or marketing a new product. <br><br>At present, I bring the whole page into Active. The page has a visible tab so I can look at loose tasks ( one page ) and project page titles at a glance and choose either.</div>

<div class="content">#5 is indeed a value of AutoFocus.  As I practice it, copying today's recurring tasks to the active page, I don't see how AF4R lacks at all.  Task of every nature are present on the active page.  (Or as Mark practices it, he moves freely to each page as desired.)<br><br>As for #6 "visual simplicity", I take it to be part of #1, but it just isn't an issue.  AF4R is just labeled pages, with task lists.<br><br>At first glance it seems like working AF4R would be confusing (#1), but that's a misperception.  Where does stuff go? Enter new stuff on one page.  Re-enter on the other page.  Put away where it belongs.</div>

<div class="content">@Paco_pepe<br><br>You ought to see "enticement" at work in AF1 with Flagged Tasks. Nothing gets my "juices flowing" like pulling flags off the task pages, putting them on the inside cover of the notebook, and seeing those flags diminish in number in the pages and increase on the inside cover. It's intoxicating.<br><br>And, to top it off, you're pulling the Flags off all the items that are standing out to you. That doubles your pleasure. And, then nagging thoughts about what you're missing on other pages is totally silenced.<br><br>For me, it has been a revelation.<br><br>Matt</div>

I must admit on this subject I am not trusty at all. I like to change, test and do things it make me advance and live a 100%. <br>I just can't believe that people keep a system for them all life.

<div class="content">I haven't used AF4R yet.  It sounds like RECURRING is very similar to a TICKLER system.  Alan reviews his Recurring list daily to identify anything that should be brought into the Unfiinished/Active list.  NEW/OLD is basically "IN" - where things go until you decide what to do (or not do) with them.<br><br>I want to have a self-contained system and future items always pose an issue for me.  I'm stuck with a separate calendar for work (Outlook) and home (iCal).  Having them separate, and the fact that entering appointments on my iPhone is a bit cumbersome, deters me from using them more than I need to.  Adding a TICKLER type list to the other AF4R ones MF proposed seems like a simple and effective solution.  <br><br>So...I'm seeing a comprehensive system based on AF4R to include:<br><br>NEW/OLD = not started yet (note:  dismissed items are effectively SOMEDAY/MAYBE if not crossed out)<br>RECURRING = things I'm committed to doing on a regular basis, but have not been ready to be on my radar NOW yet<br>UNFINISHED = started, in progress, ACTIVE<br>LATER/TICKLER = not ready to be started yet (see this closely related to RECURRING...could potentially combine the two into one list with some items dated and some not)<br>PROJECT PAGES - This is a key piece.  Managing "projects" with GTD contexts was a mess for me.  I feel much more on top of things and liberated from to-do list management when my tasks and notes for each project are in the same place.  I expect this will dramatically reduce the length of AF4R lists as well since many items will just be the project name<br><br>Not to bring up the dreaded Kanban word again, but this seems to flow along in that way.  Unfinished list items are the ACTIVE ones.  Items flow from list to list with Unfinished being the NOW.<br><br>Anyway, I am going to try this with a couple of minor tweaks.  First, I'll put a due date for the task/project in the left column when applicable.  That will give me good guidance as I'm looking through the list.  Also, I'll put a dash in the margin for todos - which I'll circle if there is a corresponding project page.<br><br>This is something I can see myself sticking with.  It's easy to spend way to much time migrating from one system to another.  I hope this leaves me with "not much more to say" too :)</div>

<div class="content">Alan Baljeu: "Active includes stuff I'm working on. When I'm done (for now), they go back to new or recurring."<br><br>When do you actually write something in the Active page? The moment before you start working on it? For all tasks? Or just those that take more than a couple of minutes?<br><br>The reason I'm asking is the following. I have been working with AF4R + 3T (electronic), but have been struggling with some overhead caused by the fact that I'm copying all the tasks that "feel ready to be done" to a separate page (for 3Tasks). While this provides the benefits of 3T, I feel it gives too much overhead of having to copy tasks.</div>

<div class="content">Why copy it?  As I understood, Mark just flags the items in af4+3t, then worked on them.  At work I just drag/drop things to the active page.  Very quick.  At home (paper) I don't bother unless it's something I will continue working on.</div>

<div class="content">Since 14 I have been working on Alan system on a AF4R system. <br><br>I stick with the system ! (at last) <br><br>Of course I still live AF1 but I have a real control about my active/unfinished tasks, my new and old ones, my scheduled tasks, my recurrings tasks and my someday may be tasks and project.  <br><br>I also have a perfect following of my projects and aims. <br><br>The only inconvenient is the size of my binder (a A4) and it weight . Not easy to put it in a wallet when i am outside and have to work on something. <br><br>Anyway I am very please with the system. Of course i tried some others (paper system from Pascal, Waf) just one day with test and nothing yet got me such a feeling of beeing in the right direction except AF1 with flags. <br><br>I found anyway a little inconvenient with AF1 i never exactly where I was going to. In fact i did my job and at the end of the day I noticed I did the most important but I did not know really how and why. With AF4R I think more. I take time to do things and my productivity is less in amount of tasks than in AF1 or even in AF4.But there is a real advantage. In a glance I know exactly where are my bigs rocks and what i must do. I also know all whicj is active so I can focus on it and do what must be. <br><br>I often regret AF1 when i was advancing in a thick fogs but doing things without really wondering how and the enthousiasm which brought me little by little to the end. <br>With AF4R there is alway a dog leash which dont let me go to the uncertain but leads me to a real control. I dont know yet if it is better. I guess my intuition was more increased by af1 that it AF4R even if sometime the system increased so fast that i wondered exactly how i could handle it.</div>
