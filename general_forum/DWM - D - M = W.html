<div class="content">Perhaps it's due to my electronic implementation, but I don't believe I reap a benefit from separating new (1 month from today) from old/repeating, tasks (7 days). In my experience, the core function of DWM is to keep me honest, and my tasks fresh. I think the same effect can be had w/ a 7 day due date for repeating and new tasks/projects. However, this can only work with some self-management and honestly. Clearly there are certain things that need to be dismissed... killed. But other things need to be put on a "Someday/Maybe" list. I think 7 days is more than enough time to decide which one applies. <br><br>All the other Forster goodness stands i.e. Little and Often, Dismissal, Standing out, etc. <br><br>Curious to hear if anyone else uses self-imposed deadlines a la DWM.</div>

<div class="content">That is just like 1-to-7 but with one entry point for all tasks. I've thought about trying it, or even a shorter, 4-day method, but I never actually implemented it. I am, however, using DIT, which is similar in that if I fall behind for 4 days I have to declare a backlog.</div>

<div class="content">7 days... a full week... and retains a bit of the spirit of the original DWM rules. Other than that, I can't see any problem using less, or more than, 7. The key point is enough days to ponder what is on your plate, what needs to be dismissed, and what needs to be put on the back burner. <br><br>Whatever one chooses, the assembly line effect is retained. And I think this is what is missing in almost every other productivity system I've come across.</div>

<div class="content">Avrum, have you read the 1-to-7 thread in the FV forum? If not, you really ought to check it out. There Mark describes a system almost identical to the one you're proposing - a seven day conveyor belt with waterfall. The difference is that in 1-to-7, each day corresponds to a type of task that is entered or re-entered on that day.</div>

<div class="content">I like this, but with 8 days, because what if next week I'm busy on the day.</div>

<div class="content">Alan:<br><br>The "due date" isn't the actual date the task needs to be done by. I like to think of DWM - the original rules - as the expiry date on my milk. I can drink the milk anytime I want. But no matter what I do with it, I'm not drinking that sucker past it's due date. It's old, done, finished, kaput.</div>

<div class="content">Yes, but there are things I want to do once a week, not usually sooner.</div>

<div class="content">That is one of the benefits of being a Reformed Christian, Alan -- I vaguely recall you mentioning you are, but please correct me if I am remembering incorrectly. I exclude Sunday from whatever system I am using (i.e., I'm using DIT and today is Saturday, so in my system right now "tomorrow" means Monday). This means that if I were using a seven-day system as avrum suggests, by excluding Sunday I would automatically have a built-in eighth day for once-a-week tasks.</div>

<div class="content">Again, DWM was the only rule/system that: <br><br>a. provided a virtual in-basket for all of my tasks, ideas, projects and goals <br>b. nudged everything along, regardless if I did any work or not<br><br>To my mind, the assembly line effect is most important. Everything else can be handled by a well worn productivity hack or rule. With respect to hard dates i.e. I need to do this task by this date, or I need to do this thing every 2nd Monday at 4. These things are best handled by a calendar.</div>
