<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>Well, I have started early and am hoping to have a full day using the AF system.<br><br>Just one more thing for now - what happens if I can't "dismiss" any items on my list because they all relate to work for clients and have to be done?<br><br>I have written 'check blog' on my list for later on!</div>

<div class="content">Jason:<br><br>Good luck with using the system - I hope you have a great day!<br><br>I doubt whether you'll get to the stage of dismissing any tasks today - it's usually several days minimum before a task gets dismissed. However when it happens you can still re-enter the item but only after you have examined it carefully to see why you are resisting it, and if necessary to re-phrase it or break it down.</div>
