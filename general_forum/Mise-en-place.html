<div class="content">While culling old Evernote notes, ran across this 2014 story from NPR, on the organizational principle of mise-en-place used by chefs. <br><br>Perhaps no big organizational surprises to the denizens of this board, but the description of the mindset and the details of their work are fascinating to me.<br><br>And related to the list/no-list discussion, here's a quote from one of the chefs:<br><br><br>  "It starts with your list," says Wylie Dufresne, the James Beard award-winning chef and owner of New York restaurants wd~50 and Alder.<br><br>  "What I used to do is, let's say I had 23 items of mise-en-place I had to do every day. So I'd take a pad and I'd write them all down on the way home. And then I would crumple the list up and throw it out," he says. "On my way to work I'd write the list again. And you become one with your list. You and the list are the same, because the list is scorched into your head."<br><br><br>Link to story: <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2014/08/11/338850091/for-a-more-ordered-life-organize-like-a-chef" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2014/08/11/338850091/for-a-more-ordered-life-organize-like-a-chef</a></div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike<br>This is exactly how my father raised us. When he'd inspect our rooms once a week, we got a lash for anything out of place even if it was only a foot off... or we had to explain our reasoning for putting it in a different place.<br><br>He worked with the same surgical nurses for years on end yet before surgery he'd always check their instrument tray.  They had to set it up so that he could see at a glace that the needed instrucments were there.  It was imprinted in his mind.  Then they were free to set up the tray to suit them.<br><br>People have always teased me by saying that I'm too methodical and my home is too unpleasantly clean and ordered.  They said that it is unwelcoming.  To me, it's heaven.  My husband was once positively shocked that when the electric went out, I was able to shower, dry my hair, apply my make up and get dressed in the dark.  I already knew by rote where everything was. Lol!  I also had good practice when I was temporarily blinded as a kid.  What my dad taught me really came in handy then.  It was also a really great test for practicing finger patterns on my musical instruments.  I was unable to cheat by glancing.  LOL!<br><br>It really makes life much easier (but I'm not as nearly precise as my Dad taught me, just precise enough for it to work.  I don't mind reaching 6 inches to the right or left.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for this great article.  I am more and more feeling that I must move away from any list I need checking to live and guide my life.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Chris and Seraphim<br>Thanks so much for the well wishes.  I'm still battling the big C but I TRY to remain optimistic after 2 years of this. I'm thinking that EVENTUALLY they'll get it all out. Meanwhile, I just try my best to carve out a decent enough life when they carve me!  LOL!  <br>I TRULY APPRECIATE your kind thoughts.<br><br>Hi Nico<br>I've been living like that for over 60 years and I still need a list.  It depends quite a bit on how complicated your life is, how much you're depended on and how much you're trying to do and natural propensities such as how good your memory is.  Some lifestyles and/or jobs must have a reminder system to properly meet all of your responsibilities, move forward your ambitions and keep track of a full appointment book.  I don't think that I ever not needed to write things down.  This system simply works great for keeping yourself in good habits of living and working. on whatever it is you're doing that benefits from good organization and habits.  Believe it or not, the structure also aids in carving out more freedom and time for enjoying hanging loose which I also love!  Bottom Line: Don't set yourself up for certain failure by expecting this to be an overlay of everything in life.</div>
