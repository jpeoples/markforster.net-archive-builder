<div class="content">Is anyone using a basic Microsoft word document for their DWM lists?<br><br>I always use Microsoft Word for DIT lists.  <br>And with AF1 or AF4 I just did the lists on a yellow legal pad (which is too bulky for all the flipping of DWM).<br><br>So I'm curious if anyone has had success (or not) with DWM in Microsoft Word.</div>

<div class="content">I'm starting to think about doing just that.<br><br>I own several task programs, but none of them print nicely and I really prefer with this new system to work from paper, to see those ever advancing tasks.<br><br>I think a list in Word might work for the best of both worlds.</div>

<div class="content">A 2 or 3 column table in Word should take care of DWM - today's date, expire date, and task description (plus any other columns that you need)<br><br>OTOH, if you have Excel, I think that might work better just because Excel's formulas for today, today+7, today+30, etc are (to me) easier to work with. But if you don't want/need the Excel formulas, Word can handle DWM.</div>

<div class="content">Ds wrote:<br>>> I own several task programs, but none of them print nicely and I really prefer with this new system to work from paper, to see those ever advancing tasks. <<<br><br>You might want to try AndreasH's AFAHK ver 0.9.4.1. It now provides DWM HTML export to very nice printable page. You can see a sample of my exported current tasks here <a href="http://www.sabre23t.com/articles/Tasks-2010-02-11-10-39-19.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sabre23t.com/articles/Tasks-2010-02-11-10-39-19.html</a> . You can filter/show combinations of "unactioned", "done" & "onreview" tasks using the buttons on top right of that webpage.<br><br>You could also just use that HTML table as template for your Word DWM tasks list. Or you might be tempted to directly use AFAHK to get the nice Ajax buttons for filtering those "unactioned", "done" & "onreview" tasks, and automatic entering of the dates/times. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">>> but can't use it on my Mac! <<<br><br>My apologies for assuming you use Windows, ds. I forgot MS Word is also on Mac. Anyway, hopefully the HTML page is useful as sample or template. ;-)<br><br>A quick google does confirm that there is no Autohotkey direct equivalent on Mac (yet). However, this thread "IronAHK - .NET port of AutoHotkey for Windows, Linux, Mac..." <a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/forum/topic34421-75.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.autohotkey.com/forum/topic34421-75.html</a> does indicate that they progressed to Version 0.1.1 (alpha) as of January 2010. Not ready for prime time but does work for very simple AHK scripts.</div>

<div class="content">AutofocusAHK does work with Wine, so can be run under Linux and Mac OS. It just loses the majority of its appeal by the fact that Wine doesn't support global hotkeys of Windows applications, so you have to use the tray menu. I'm currently looking into this by make the different actions accessible by command line switches. Then it's just a matter of assigning hotkeys to the different commands using the tools your OS gives you. I expect to get it working under Linux by next week. But I don't know how global hotkeys are managed in Mac OS and I don't have a Mac for testing.</div>
