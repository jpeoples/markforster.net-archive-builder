<div class="content">Great insight for me, but possibly something the rest of you already know.<br><br>I'm a big fan of the "everything" book. If in doubt, that's where I write it down. No loose pages to get lost or out of order. Eventually, some pages get torn out or photo copied and put in the appropriate reference file. Most of the pages get thrown out after a few months rather than filed.<br><br>Yesterday I tore the pages from my trusted desk book (neatly), punched holes, and put them in the binder. (I now regret it. The few other times I've used a binder, it's only lasted a few months, but spiral-bound lasts seasons. It seemed like a good idea at the time.) The process brought this observation to the fore:<br><br>If the book is hard-bound and small, such as my current travel book, it's easier to photocopy pairs of facing pages than to tear out pages. I need to start notes on the left page. That way, I can photocopy the first and second page easily.<br><br>If the book is full-size or spiral-bound, it's easier to tear out pages than photocopy them. I need to start notes on the right-hand page, so there isn't another project on the back. This is faster and, despite the blank sides, better for the planet than photocopying.<br><br>Plan: Rather than trying to remember this distinction (especially frustrating if I remember it half-way through a meeting), I should just buy travel books with pages that tear out easily.<br><br>Silly, yes, but one of those little annoyances that aren't quite worth tracking down, but absolutely worth acknowledging when you solve.<br><br>Meanwhile, I'm looking for an excuse to buy the Circa/Levenger/Arc binding system. It has most of the benefits of a binder and spiral-bound in one system, but the start-up cost is just beyond my "on a whim" limit.</div>

<div class="content">Cricket<br><br>Get yourself a Doxie portable scanner <a href="http://www.getdoxie.com/product/doxie-go/index.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.getdoxie.com/product/doxie-go/index.html</a> and then you can tear the pages out of your notebook there and then, and you don't even need to remember about not having a project on the back of the page because you can arrange the pages when you download them to your computer. Upload everything to Evernote.<br><br>I got myself a Doxie about three months ago and it's a godsend. It's small enough to fit into a bag or briefcase and doesn't need either a power source or a computer when you're scanning.</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br>Thanks for this pointer to the Doxie Go! I owned a portable ScanSnap in 2010 and made good use of it that year. Innovation has now caught up with my wish list: battery powered, wireless, SD card memory, no computer needed, can sync to Macs, PCs, iPads, iPhones, Dropbox, and Evernote!</div>
