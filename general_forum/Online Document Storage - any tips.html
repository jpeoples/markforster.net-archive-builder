<div class="content">Hi everyone, <br><br>I've been using google docs to store my electronic documents & folders but I find it a bit 'clunky'. <br><br>I'd like to be able to access my documents and folders in various locations. <br><br>Does anybody know of any better online equivalents that are free to use?<br><br>Thanks,</div>

<div class="content">Hi Leon: ypu can try Dropbox. Have a look at this thread <br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1166236" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1166236</a><br><br>The free option has a generous enough amount of space, and at the same time you can do yourself and Roger a favour if you refer him when registering.</div>

<div class="content">If want something simple (and your documents are relatively simple), check out Simplenote.  Your docs are stored online, and available from many mobile/desktop clients.<br><br>For a little more structure & features (but not too much), try Evernote.  It has fancier notes, tagging, and can recognize text within images (whiteboard, etc).  Plus they're an awesome company (no relation other than I'm a customer).<br><br>Both Simplenote and Evernote are free, although Evernote provides premium features for $5/month (well worth it for PDF searching, all file types, and better mobile/offline viewing).</div>

<div class="content">Hi Leon,<br><br>As JD said Dropbox is very good free online files/folders syncing/sharing. And signing via referrals to benefit additional storage for referrer/referree is cool, ref <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1166236" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1166236</a> . ;-)<br><br>I use Dropbox clients on my office & home PCs and Cloudfiles Dropbox client on mobile phone WM6.5.<br><br>Anyway, did you use any files/folders syncing tools with your Google Docs account?

<div class="content">adrive.com looks interesting, offering 50GB free. Thanks for the tip about cloudfiles, sabre23t, as till now I had been unable to effectively use Dropbox with my Windows Mobile phone.</div>
