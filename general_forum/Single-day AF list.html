<div class="content">Thought I would share something that I'm doing today...  Passover starts tonight and prior to todayI had done very little in regards to getting ready for it.  Last night I was feeling completely overwhelmed by the list of things that had to happen for seder tonight so I took out a sheet of paper and made a mini-AF list with everything I could think of - food prep, cleaning, moving of furniture.  <br><br>Today, I've simply been working through the list in the normal AF way and am feeling completely in control.  Everything will get done in a timely manner, even though I have barely done anything cooking-related (and it's 12:30 already!).  I even prepped for my morning meeting tomorrow because I had put that on my mini-list.<br><br>A lot of the things that are on this mini-list also appear in my main AF book, so I will have the pleasure of marking them as done when I pass by them next.<br><br>Still to be seen: how the mini-list will fare when my able assistant gets here in a little while.</div>
