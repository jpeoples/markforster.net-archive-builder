<div class="content">Hi :) I'm mostly a stalker, however I have been looking for something, and just realized that this group (being the todo list/productivity junkies we are) might be able to help me find it.<br><br>Does anyone know of any simple project management/online collaboration software (preferably one I can host on my own website) or a cheap/free online website for project management? Out of everything I've looked at, I like Basecamp the best, but it just seems too expensive. The more reasonably priced alternatives I've found (hitalk, mango, etc.) are either too complicated or you can't organize todos into projects (as is the case with rememberthemilk).<br><br>Thanks!<br>-Mandiana</div>

<div class="content">Have you tried GoPlan (<a href="http://goplanapp.com/home/plans" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://goplanapp.com/home/plans</a> )? It's a "basecamp-level" quality solution, but a bit cheaper. <br><br>For my software development projects I use a self-hosted solution called ChiliProject (<a href="http://chiliproject.org" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://chiliproject.org</a> ) — a fork based on the equaly good Redmine (<a href="http://redmine.org" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://redmine.org</a> ) — but for simple task management these might be a bit too complex.</div>

<div class="content">I'm looking to evaluate FogBugz ... <a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/fogbugz/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.fogcreek.com/fogbugz/</a> . It may look more like a bug tracking or helpdesk tool, but it can be used for project management as well. At least, that's my hope.</div>

<div class="content">I also took a look at <a href="http://www.pivotaltracker.com/features#overview" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.pivotaltracker.com/features#overview</a> which I like better but can't / won't use because it doesn't integrated with my development tool.</div>

<div class="content">I almost ended up going with Google Docs, Michael. :) <br><br>In the end, we chose GoPlan. When I canceled the trial Basecamp account, they offered a lower priced package that would have worked for us, but we actually ended up liking GoPlan the best. The lower priced Basecamp plans were hidden in tiny text under their 3 most expensive plans.<br><br>Thank you for all of the suggestions!</div>

<div class="content">you already found solution, so this is too late for you, however I did want to add to conversation anyway.<br><br>1. I'd also suggest Google Docs<br>2. agree about Basecamp as just too, something, fiddly, weird user interface - great idea, but other sites now seem to have done better.<br>3. minigroup looks great, adding features fast . is a simple group web site, so much easier than Facebook, without all the junk.<br>4. and brand new Google Plus could likely be used for online collaboration<br><br>and I'm going to go look at GoPlan and others listed here, thank you</div>

<div class="content">I don't really think basecamp is expensive. Hmmm it's actually reasonable since you get what you are paying for. I find basecamp's features very easy and very user-friendly. You may want to try these basecamp alternatives here: <a href="http://www.timedoctor.com/blog/2011/02/02/43-project-management-software-alternatives" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.timedoctor.com/blog/2011/02/02/43-project-management-software-alternatives</a> and see which ones you like.<br><br>There's freshbooks, central desktop, smartsheet, etc., which features are listed in the spreadsheet so you can compare them with each other. It's best to know its features first so you can evaluate if it meets your requirements in project management software.</div>
