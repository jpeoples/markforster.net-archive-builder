<div class="content">I wonder if it helps to orientate one's self to operating within 3 basic modes of self management: <br><br>Inbox Zero <br><br>Discretionary AF (or DIT, AF 2-4R, DWN, GTD etc.)<br><br>Schedule and Routine <br><br>As these are modes, it is possible to move between modes several times daily as neccessary. <br><br>I wonder if this would help keep the AF list length manageable whilst also offering a holistic approach to self management. I prefer to operate Inbox Zero once per day. But I know this is unrealistic for many. <br><br>Sorry if this is very basic stuff. As I've said before writing posts seems good for consolidating my own thoughts/ideas.</div>

<div class="content">leon:<br><br>I'm not quite clear what you mean by "discretionary" AF. Do you mean you use AF when you feel like it, or that you choose which type of AF?<br><br>I operate an Inbox Zero policy, as described in DIT the book, but I regard it as part of AF/DIT, not as a separate mode.</div>

<div class="content">Email isn't a big enough thing to demand a whole mode. Put email in AF and process to 0 after which it's a done, but recurring item.<br><br>Habits are good to develop, and so far I'm finding it awkward to put them into AF. I think it works better as a trigger: when you leave work, look at the leave-work list.  Certain events and times you might set AF aside and do according to the routine.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark: By 'discretionary' I simply mean discretionary time, either at work or at home but it's essentially an open schedule for working on 'to do' items. But I'd always try to be consistent and use one system. <br><br> I personally have very little discretionary time at home, so for me thinking in this 'mode' way helps me to not beat myself up!<br><br>Hi Alan: Good point. Inbox Zero for me includes Paper, Email & Voicemail.</div>
