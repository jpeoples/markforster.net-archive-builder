<div class="content">Do you or should you include tasks that you don't necessarily want to do, but feel you should? I'm not talking about responsibilities (filing taxes, child care, etc.), but other less vital concerns (organizing a closet, for example).</div>

<div class="content">Mel,<br><br>I kind of did this when I dumped my Flylady journal tasks into AF.  I ended up dismissing almost all of them because I could see that I wouldn't have time for what I knew was more important to me to get done if I spent my time doing those things.</div>

<div class="content">I agree; it is liberating to do these should tasks or finally admit you aren't going to do them.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mel<br><br>The benefit of adding those tasks in is that they force you to make a decision.  They may surprise you and stand out easily or you may find adding them to the list gives you the kick start you need to get motivated.  Or you dismiss ..... either way you have addressed the task and made a decision.</div>

<div class="content">Or, who knows, you may just do a little bit on it, say that's good enough and don't re-enter it.  That's also what I did with a bunch of those kind of things.</div>

<div class="content">Mel,<br><br>I find that to be a tricky issue.  The basic thing that caused me so much trouble with AF2 was that "someday/maybe" items were getting on to my list and clogging it up.  (That oversimplifies it, but it is about right.)  I found that if I get too many things on the list that I'm not committed to doing then I get stuck.  My solution was to ask myself, every time I add something, if I REALLY REALLY INTEND to do it this week.  If not, I immediately dismiss it ... which makes it a "someday/maybe" that I can come back to later.  But it does get it out of the road.<br><br>But your question was about "shoulds".  Yes, but only if you WILL ... is my answer.</div>
