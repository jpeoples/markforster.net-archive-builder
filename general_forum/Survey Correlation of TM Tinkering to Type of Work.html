<div class="content">Seven responses already, and we're already seeing a trend, I think.<br><br>Can we get some more responses?   :-)</div>

<div class="content">We have 18 responses so far -- I'd like to get over 20 before I publish the results.  LAST CALL!<br><br>Here's the link again:<br><a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/PQ8MTJZ" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/PQ8MTJZ</a></div>

<div class="content">OK, we have 27 responses.<br><br>25 people answered "YES" to the question "Do you frequently try new time management techniques and/systems?"<br><br>Of these, more than 60% of respondents answered they are involved in "development" work of some kind, while only 28% / 22% respectively answered they are involved in "execution" or "KTBR" work.<br><br>YES results shown on a chart here (25 of 27 responders):<br><a href="http://www.dropbox.com/s/luhksnnjr5jnfw7/Type%20of%20Work%20-%20people%20who%20answered%20YES.png" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.dropbox.com/s/luhksnnjr5jnfw7/Type%20of%20Work%20-%20people%20who%20answered%20YES.png</a><br><br>NO results shown on a chart here (only 2 responders):<br><a href="http://www.dropbox.com/s/c35rb9ganz0t5f8/Type%20of%20Work%20-%20people%20who%20answered%20NO.png" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.dropbox.com/s/c35rb9ganz0t5f8/Type%20of%20Work%20-%20people%20who%20answered%20NO.png</a><br><br><br>So it does seem that people who spend time with their time-management systems tend to spend a lot of time working on development work and process improvement work in general.<br><br>Which is perhaps a data point that could run counter to the argument that people who spend time with time management systems are simply people who tend to tinker with time management as a form of procrastination.</div>

<div class="content">This may help explain why my wife is very productive but doesn't spend any time at all thinking about time management systems, workflow organization, etc., but is still manages to accomplish a huge amount of meaningful work every day.   She uses a few useful and reliable tools:  an overall schedule for the household, a calendar with some appointments, and the occasional ad-hoc list of reminders or list of priority projects scribbled on paper stuck on the refrigerator with a magnet.   That's about it.   If any of these things are misplaced, it can be annoying but isn't threatening to the overall organization of the home and can be quickly re-created or re-started.<br><br>On the other hand, I am always thinking how to standardize and improve the processes of my work and life, even things like cleaning out the car, washing the dishes, establishing a habitual morning routine that minimizes extraneous movement and doesn't leave anything to thought, etc.    I also like to make sure things follow a well-thought-out organization and plan, and am sometimes paralyzed when I can't identify clear patterns, organization, etc., in the situation right in front of me.<br><br>My wife is very different - she just jumps right into her work, and pushes forward till it's done, without giving much thought (if any) to turning it into a system.<br><br>This affects even how we go about learning languages, for instance.   My wife pretty easily starts picking up new words, imitating gestures, intonation, and expressions, and can start communication quickly.   I can't do that at all -- I need a framework to hang it all on.   I find myself resisting even hearing the sounds till I have at least a minimal framework (a little bit of grammar, for example) with which to interpret the experience of a new language.   Without that framework, I feel lost and can't make progress.<br><br>Each approach has its tradeoffs.   For regularly repeated processes that tend to be time-consuming, my approach has long-term benefits of efficiency and order -- but my approach is much worse when it comes to just getting started, especially on ad-hoc tasks that don't easily succumb to being systematized.   My wife's approach is just the opposite.<br><br>Having been married for a while now, I've come to value my wife's approach very highly, and to learn to temper my own approach with a dash of her straightforward sensibility.   It's helped me to be more effective.  But more importantly, it's helped me to see when it makes more sense just to DO SOMETHING rather than circle around the thing, plotting my overall strategy.   That just doesn't make sense when the task at hand is "get the kids into the car so we can get to the appointment when we are already 10 minutes late"!    It might make sense later to think how to organize the recurring bottlenecks in that overall process (making sure the shoes near the door are organized so it's easy for everyone to find their own shoes and not searching everywhere for missing pairs, etc.).   But it's not the time to start thinking about that when we're trying to get out the door!<br><br>Anyway...   I think it does boil down to a difference of "system orientation" vs "action orientation", learning what one's own orientation is, understand its strengths and weaknesses, and tempering one's tendencies so one applies a system when it makes sense and simply takes action without trying to systematize it when the situation calls for straightforward, immediate action.     <br><br>I think this has a lot of implications for effectively managing oneself, one's workflow, and one's time.   Perhaps we need these systems a lot less than most of us here think we do.</div>

<div class="content">On the topic of information management, and possibly optimizing or over-optimizing systems, this is one of my favorite quotes. It's from Robertson Davies' novel "Tempest-Tost":<br><br>"Oho, now I know what you are. You are an advocate of Useful Knowledge…. Well, allow me to introduce myself to you as an advocate of Ornamental Knowledge. You like the mind to be a neat machine, equipped to work efficiently, if narrowly, and with no extra bits or useless parts. I like the mind to be a dustbin of scraps of brilliant fabric, odd gems, worthless but fascinating curiosities, tinsel, quaint bits of carving, and a reasonable amount of healthy dirt. Shake the machine and it goes out of order; shake the dustbin and it adjusts itself beautifully to its new position."</div>

<div class="content">My wife manages tasks and projects the same way -- a few lists when she needs them, no extra kerfuffle, leave in plenty of time, etc. I've also noticed she simply chooses to keep less on her mind than I do. She'd rather not spin any plates at all. Whereas I kind of feel perverse pleasure when I can keep several plates spinning and entertain 12 ideas at once.</div>
