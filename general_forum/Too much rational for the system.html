<div class="content">First things first, I was referred by another website I can't remember that I got to from <a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.artofmanliness.com</a><br><br>I find that I'm having to "overload" the rational side a bit more than using my intuition.  I get that feeling of "release" when I come to a task that, if I start/do/follow my inclination on, will make me late for an appointment or would end up being not a terribly efficient use of my time.  And, when faced with several options I feel "release" on, I have to prioritize in order to make the most efficient use of my time, or dismiss one because if I do the other two, they fit well together.<br><br>Is this how the system was intended to be used, or is this considered "over-complicating" it?  This is really the only "snag" I've hit, if you could call it that.  I'm not struggling with it.  I have no problems dismissing or passing over a task that I feel release on when I know it isn't an appropriate use of my time, at that moment.  And it really is the "rational" part, because I find myself pausing to think about it for a few moments.  I'm bringing it up because I hope to learn something, and I figured it was worth discussion.<br><br>I must say, I'm getting so much more done than I used to.  Thanks to this, I'm more productive than ever.  This is my first time-management system, so I may find another works better in the future, but by virtue of the fact that this was free and immediately available, it has been a significant help and encouragement to me.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jaymz<br><br>If you has time specific tasks such as appointments which must be done on time they would normally be scheduled (with a reminder task to check schedule on your list periodically!) With other tasks try to go with what your intuition says rather than rationally deciding it is not an appropriate use of your time.  If the system says do A and your rational mind says do B go with B - as you learn to trust the system you will begin to see a difference.<br><br>When you have scanned the list quickly and are then passing more slowly through the list, do the first item that stands out and only then move on to the next. Don't try to grade two or three items at a time, just move down the list methodically, working on each item that stands out as you come to it.</div>

<div class="content">Christine:<br><br>Did you mean to say:<br><br>"If the system says do A and your rational mind says do B go with A"? (not B)</div>
