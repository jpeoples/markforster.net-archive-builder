<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-08-6 19:17</div>
<div class="content">In the Revised AF instructions, it says:<br><br>"2) If you cannot do any tasks on a page because of your location (i.e. it’s physically impossible to do them), then you can skip the page and continue in Forward Mode."<br><br>Does this replace Mark's previous advice to have a separate list for each location?<br><br>Recently I realised that one of the reasons my list tends to stagnate is that I spend periods of time in different places, where I have different tasks and responsibilities.  There are currently four such locations.  Sometimes I spend a week in each location, sometimes two, at the moment I am coming to the end of a six week spell in one place.  <br><br>I have always stuck to using one list - that was one of the things that appealed to me about AF in the first place.  Using AF1, I found it difficult to dismiss items, because I knew they were important, but I was unable to deal with them in the location (and state of mind) I was in.  Under RAF, I have felt able to put them on review - I have a steadily growing list of items I can't do here, but must be aware of, as soon as I return to one of the other locations.  At first I crossed them out with a note in the margin for the location they belonged to - I can't carry a highlighter - too many bad experiences with leakage! - but now I have started a 'Review' list on a separate page instead.  <br><br>So it occurs to me that I could just as well start a list for items to do in each location and not clutter up my current list.  Then I would have four AF lists, one 'active' and three being added to, but not worked, at any given time - at least until I work out a way to be in two places at once!<br><br>Would this be okay or is too far from the spirit of AF?<br><br>acedia</div>

<div class="content">Acedia,<br><br>I do think the new rule of moving forward to the next page even if you do not action any item on a list is new and does somewhat override the idea of having multiple contextual lists.<br><br>*However* this new rule only allows you to move forward on a list, it doesn't seem to save any of this "out of context" items from review. Recall that FM no longer dismisses or reviews items. Usually when you got stuck on a page in FM you skipped it and deleted it. Now you return to RM. The above rule change regarding contexts keeps you out of RM for a little while longer until you get to a page of items that are truly unactionable and not merely unactionable because they are in the wrong context.<br><br>However, once returning to RM, the inexorable review line will move down the list and eventually your out of context items will be up for review.<br><br>I *think* perhaps what Mr. Forster envisioned was that contextual changes would happen faster than the line moved, i.e. most people would get back home or get to their place of work before the line moved across that context.<br><br>This, however, wouldn't seem to work if our duration within contexts was a longer period. As with you, being in one context for two weeks and then another. Another example would be going on vacation for a few weeks away from home.<br><br>I *think* in such cases (and perhaps Mr. Forster mentioned this somewhere on the forum) one could be best served having alternate contextual lists such as "AF-While in Hawaii", etc.<br><br>Your approach of having a single list and then using the items on review to generate another list which are essential containing out-of-context items seems workable. The only issue that I can see is that it will comprise of *both* out-of-context items and run of the mill reviewed items (in context). It might be extra work filtering it.<br><br>Thoughts?<br>--Joseph</div>

<div class="content">Acedia,<br><br>Re: Highlighter ... I've recently seen pencil highlighters.  That might be something to look into.  (I can't remember where I saw them, but if I do ...)<br><br>Re: Multiple lists -- I think it is in the spirit of Mark's conception.  But if you have too many of them you might get into the confusion resulting from the GtD idea of "context lists".  You end up fussing with were things go and trying to find the right list for the right place and .... well, it can be a nightmare ;-)<br><br>One thing you might find useful is to get a "Five Subject" notebook ... or just divide up one book in some way.  Or use a book with movable pages.  All of which works to keep yo with one book and items segregated.  One possibility is to just draw columns in your book fo the various locations.  Possibilitites are endless ;-)<br></div>

<div class="content">Joseph, <br><br>Thanks for explaining that - I haven't really got to grips with the effect of changing mode in RAF - now I see that the passage I quoted wouldn't apply to RM, only FM.  So review would still apply - I guess it would be more in keeping with AF principles to deal with such items at the review stage rather than structure my lists so as to avoid seeing them till I am in the other location.  Also there is a risk I would pre-judge the issue and unnecessarily postpone some tasks that I actually could do now.  Putting everything on one list to start with still seems like the best idea, but I need to get better at identifying these items and dealing with them so they don't clog up the rest of the list, which I find very demotivating.<br><br>You make a good point about the review list including two different sorts of items - indeed it does!  I hadn't thought about that either.  Sooner or later, these items - which cannot be done in my current location, but which I need to get onto as soon as possible when in the right location - have to go on a list that I can turn to and use, without any further filtering.  <br><br>Perhaps the solution is to keep a separate list to 'carry forward' to the next location, adding items to it either when they stand out - but cannot be done - which would count as 'doing' that item - or when they are reviewed and it is obvious that location is the reason they didn't get done - or perhaps as a matter of common sense whenever I realise they cannot be done in the current location.  That would still allow me to add everything to one list - which I like - without artificially classifying tasks before they have had a chance to be considered under normal AF principles, plus it also gives me the carry forward list, ready to roll when I need it.  Any items which come up for review, but for other reasons, not to do with location, would not get added to the carry forward list!<br><br>I will try this and see how it goes.<br><br>acedia</div>

<div class="content">acedia,<br><br>I think you've hit upon it with your last paragraph! That would solve the issues neatly.<br><br>One refinement that I might make would to allow oneself to add something *directly* to the "carry forward/location" list without first having to enter it onto another list. (I almost said your "main" Autofocus list, but that doesn't make sense. It is merely your "current context" Autofocus list.)<br><br>I understand that you want to avoid classifying tasks before they are cranked through the AF system, and I agree that in the other examples you give, and in normal circumstances it would be better for items to come up for review and then move them to the alternate list(s). But in the cases where your item is a flashing neon "I can't be done but in one special context!" item. . . say, for instance, the item "kiss wife". . . perhaps it would be best to enter that item directly onto any special context lists one has. <br><br>What do you think?<br>--Joseph</div>

<div class="content">Mike,<br><br>A pencil highlighter sounds quite intriguing!  I am a big fan of pencils generally and used one for my first AF list, though for some reason I have now switched to a blue biro.  Anyway I will try googling it later.<br><br>I completely agree about too many lists leading to fuss and bother - I have lived that nightmare!  I used to use context lists - though I didn't call them that - when I was working, because they were useful, but times have changed and now I have my telephone, my computer, my files and my thinking chair all in one room - so classic GTD contexts are not helpful for me anymore.  But I recognise that for some people they may be vital. <br><br> The last time I tried GTD I substituted my locations - which are different cities - for contexts, which made more sense.  But I also had to have an 'Anywhere' list, which meant I always had to look at two lists to see which actions were available. I was using a software app, which didn't allow me to view them both on the same screen.  I could have used paper, but it would have involved a lot of re-copying, so I relied on the software instead, which ended up being quite restrictive .... one of the things I love about AF is the way it works so well on paper.<br><br>Mmm, I am always very tempted by those Five Subject notebooks, but I am in a long-term relationship with my filofax, so I mustn't stray.  Possibilities, as you say, are indeed endless, but that is part of the problem, not part of the solution!<br><br>acedia</div>

<div class="content">>>>One thing you might find useful is to get a "Five Subject" notebook ... <br><br>Mike,<br><br>that's an idea worth looking at. I also am in a bit of a quandary in that I have my main notebook on my desk which is where I like to have ALL my tasks on view as it gives me a good over-view of where I am with my projects, plans and workload. This is where AF really has shone for me and it's why I'm loathe to start splitting into different notebooks for every location. <br><br>Another workaround could be to make a daily list on a seperate sheet or record card from your primary notebook for that day's major tasks. It means writing them out again but it shouldn't take a minute and it saves lugging a notebook about with you everywhere.</div>

<div class="content">Ashak,<br><br>I've tried those Five Subject books ... long ago.  They had some uses but they are not my cuppa.<br><br>Personally, I make a daily list, but I do it for the crucial items as I work in 3x5 format so my main AF list is in my pocket.<br><br>Rewriting things is no big problem for me.  It gives me time to consider the task and possibly reword it or add something else.  It's a good thing ;-)<br><br>Another option is those "Circa" / "Rolabind" notebooks.  You can add and remove pages moving them from one place to another.  You could have a master book and a traveling book ... much smaller.  You'd only need to keep a few blank sheets other than what was current in your traveling book and when filled, they can move to an archive or master book or something.  It is a bit on the expensive side, but it might be worth it.</div>

<div class="content">Joseph,<br><br>I have to say that 'kiss wife' wouldn't appear on any of my lists, in any context or location!!  <br><br>But, yes, I do have some items that are clearly location specific, so in theory it should be safe to enter those straight away, as you say .... the trouble is, that I don't think I can trust myself not to take advantage and use it as another way of procrastinating tasks that could actually be done. It may be that I need to go through the process each and every time.  I am a bad case!<br><br>acedia</div>

<div class="content">Mike,<br><br>the other problem with a Five subject book is I only really need two subjects. For now the best solution for me is a small list on paper or card to take with me on location. The added advantage of this is that it is "clean" and I don't have to root out the relevant tasks from stuff at home or in my office. <br><br>I haven't really considered a circa binder as they don't feel so secure, and I'm pretty happy with a spiral notebook as my main AF tool. I look forward to hearing other users solutions though.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Ashak,<br><br>As I mentioned already, I use a filofax, which is very flexible and lets you carry not just your list, but also your calendar, address book, project plans, etc etc, all in one book.  They are also pretty secure - some models have zip fastenings, so can hold lots of other stuff (keys, glasses, mobile) as well.  There are two main drawbacks - the cost and the way that the rings reduce the size of the page when writing.  Provided you can live with these, it is a very practical solution.  <br><br>acedia</div>

<div class="content">Ashak,<br><br>My approach is to ask questions about purpose.  For the notebook I asked questions about how I would use it that went something like this:<br><br>- Will I use this at a desk?  NO.  I have to carry it with me.  That determined the form factor.  3x5 fits in my pocket so I don't forget to carry it.  Any larger and I'd have my hand occupied and I'd have to pick it up and take it.  Not a good idea.<br><br>- Is 3x5 large enough?  Yes.  I carry a second 4x6 book for writing records ... phone conversations, meetings, doodling, lists of prices at stores, etc.<br><br>- Will I keep the pages has history?  NO.  I don't need that.  Then I don't need a bound book.  Were I to want to keep pages, I'd get a bound book.<br><br>- Do I need to move things around?  NO.  A simple spiral is enough.  I am happy to rewrite where necessary. <br><br>- Do I need to carry lots of project info around with me?  No.  So I can keep the majority of my project info in a composition book or computer file for when I review ... which I do at my desk so they don't have to travel.<br><br>- What about writing implements?  I don't like pencil as it smears.  I don't want to carry a big pen so I found one that breaks down.  This one to be exact:<br><br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/ZEB27411-F-301-Compact-Retractable-Ballpoint/dp/B001B0D21C/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=office-products&qid=1249599731&sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/ZEB27411-F-301-Compact-Retractable-Ballpoint/dp/B001B0D21C/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=office-products&qid=1249599731&sr=8-1</a><br><br>It fits right in the spiral wire with the clip on the spirals so it does not get lost.  It is no larger than the width of the pad so I don't even know it is there.<br><br>- Do I need to highlight on the go?  NO.  I can mark the entries and highlight when I get back to my desk.<br><br>So the answer was:<br><br>- 1 3x5 spiral on the top<br>- 1 break down pen<br>- 1 4x6 Mead 60 page spiral at the top<br><br>That is my whole system!  The rest is the rules I use and how I write the tasks down and what I do when I get back to the desk ... which is really damn little.</div>

<div class="content">BTW, when I worked at IBM and was desk bound (or plane bound, or airport bound or ...) my system was different and reflected my needs there.  For that purpose I used an 8x11 format for everything and used an 8x11 spiral notebook which went right into a standard ring binder that held my tickler files, calendar, project info, plane tickets (in a plastic pouch), phone list, etc.<br><br>So it really does pay to ask questions about purpose before defining the system, it seems to me.</div>

<div class="content">Mike,<br><br>Informative reply there, I will give it some thought although i'm not sure what you meant by the spiral notebook going into a three ring binder? Does it clip in or you just place it there? More thoughts tomorrow in any case, I'll give you a more specific requirement for myself as well...maybe you have some good suggestions.<br><br>Acedia,<br><br>Strangely, i have never really considered a filofax for a long time but the portability factor is a plus, and obviously everything in one place is something I really appreciate. What size is the one you use for AF? The A5 type or the larger desk version? The smaller one would be handy, but do you lose something of the overall view?

<div class="content">Joseph,<br><br>You can by 8x11 dividers pre-labeled Jan-Dec, and 1-31, and A-Z.  That is all you need to set up a complete tickler and reference system.<br><br>My stuff for next month was under the month tab until the end of this month, then it moved to the day tabs.  My phone and contact and other key info lived in A-Z or else if it was a big current project, it had its own tab.  I also had open at the top punched heavy duty flexible plastic sheets to stick things like plane tickets and those went into the 43 tabs system.<br><br>Elsewhere I describe my bi-weekly calendar, my "Every" sheet, etc.  I had a somewhat elaborate system for my spiral notebook involving codes and symbols so I could quickly track things down.  I always left five pages in the front blank to build an index so I could find crucial things.<br><br>Oh, and if you do the binder thing, get the "D" ring kind.  The front then opens flat and the back stays straight because of the straight post.  You'll get the idea when you see one.<br><br>But, as I say, that was when I had to keep track of gobs of stuff and come up with answers on the spot.  My briefcase was my home in those days.  <sigh> I don't miss them AT ALL ;-)</div>

<div class="content">If you have only two contexts (e.g., work and home), the "stalactite/stalagmite" method works great with RAF.   And, see below for an alternate method that might work with three or four contexts, but still only one notebook.<br><br>I.e.:  <br><br>Adding new tasks:  Write new work tasks from the top of the page down.  Write new home tasks from the bottom of the page up.  Eventually they meet in the middle.  Draw a big line across the page where they meet, and start a new page.<br><br>Doing tasks:  In Reverse Mode, I really don't find that reading each page from the bottom up is necessary.  I just read from the top down (then flip to the previous page if nothing on the current page feels ready to be done).   If I am "at work", I pay close attention to the items above the middle line, but still scan the items below the line.  If I am taking a break, I might look for something below the line to do.  If I am "at home", I focus on the items below the line.<br><br>Also, I use only the right-hand pages of the notebook for AF.  I use the left-hand pages for notes.<br><br>However, if you wanted, you could use the left-hand pages for one or two additional locations.  If you did it like that, you could still use one notebook for up to four different contexts.  Just scan the whole spread when you are looking for tasks to do.  I've never tried that, but maybe it would work.</div>

What size is the one you use for AF? The A5 type or the larger desk version? The smaller one would be handy, but do you lose something of the overall view?"<br><br>Yes, it's true that the filofax is often forgotten as a productivity tool - perhaps because for a while it became more of a fashion item - and fashions always move on - but for anyone using paper it is well worth considering.   <br><br>I have an A5 and would love to use it for AF, but it is too large to carry in my handbag.  So it sits on my desk, where I plan to use it for making notes on long term goals and project planning - something I don't do at all at the moment.  I am actually using a Pocket size, which is quite small and easily goes everywhere with me.  But I may try the Personal, which is in between and may be the best compromise in the end.  <br><br>By the way, I bought mine secondhand on eBay, which I strongly recommend if you are not sure which size to get - you can experiment without worrying about the amount of your investment!  Obviously there are also many other brands which all do the same thing - in the UK both W H Smith and Collins do a filofax clone, at much lower cost.  <br><br>The biggest drawback with any of these is the amount of space taken up by the rings.  If you find this too annoying, there are also some organisers without rings.  Someone on this forum (sorry, can't remember who) recommended the X47:  <a href="http://www.x47.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.x47.com/</a>  This uses a spring loaded metal spine which fits into a tube on the binder.  They look beautiful but are frighteningly expensive.  The same company also makes a cheaper range called the X17: <a href="http://www.myx17.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.myx17.com/</a>  which uses rubber bands.  Just to make things interesting, I recently came across another company which makes a similar binder using clips: <a href="http://www.roterfaden.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.roterfaden.com/</a>  With all these there is a lot of choice as to the kind of booklet that is inserted, so you could have almost as much flexibility as with a filofax, but a much smaller and neater binder.<br><br>As Mike said, 'possibilities are endless' .....<br><br>acedia</div>

<div class="content">Returning to the original post in this thread, location/context are fundamental in my life and thus the way I use RAF, and AF1 and 2 before RAF.<br>I started a thread on this, see <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/840117" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/840117</a><br><br>I'm still using my Moleskine notebook (medium), but like the idea of the stalagmites and -tites to separate my work and personal items.<br><br>At present I at home, so only enter into my main RAF list those tasks which can be done at home, in the office or home, or errands.  My next assignment  - seven weeks in Tanzania - starts towards the end of August.<br>For Tanzania, only tasks preparatory to my assignment are entered into the main list, eg get visa, review packing and supplies list, suss out accommodation options, find out Internet connection options (eg mobile broadband), order sufficient medication, and so.<br><br>Anything to be done ON the assignment goes into a separate RAF "Next Assignment" Context list.<br><br>So at any point in time, my main RAF list's open items should only be those capable of being done in my current context.  When I change locations/contexts (from Home to Travel to Assignment) the context-specific lists "feed" the main RAF list.<br>The advantage is that I can capture context-specific items and then more or less forget about them until I reach that context.  This cuts down on cluttering the main list with tasks that indeed cannot be physically done in my current context.<br><br>The Circa solution for a note book sounds great, but no stockists in the UK and I don't know when I will be next in the US.  Like others, I prefer to keep one notebook.<br><br> I guess one solution would be an A5 file with dividers, but it must be rugged enough to be carried around in my cabin luggage.  I don;t need to have a calendar or address/telephone list as these are in Outlook and now on my new HTC Touch Pro 2 Pocket PC Phone.<br><br>So perhaps the best for me is to keep Context/Location lists (the "feeders" when i change locations) in OneNote along with Project Task lists, and use the Moleskine as the main RAF current list, RH pages only, meeting notes on LH pages.<br><br><br><br></div>
