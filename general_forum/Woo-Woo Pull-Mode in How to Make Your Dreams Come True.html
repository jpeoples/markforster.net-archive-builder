<div class="content">I thought about looking up Mark's most woo-woo book that I own to get some insights into working in flow (Mark's *Pull Mode*) towards a vision:<br><br>In "How to Make Your Dreams Come True", Mark wrote about the three modes of living:  Push Mode, Drift Mode and Pull Mode.  (p. 27)<br>Pull Mode is "characterised by *letting* things happen."  Later he says that "Pull Mode has some superficial resemblances to Push Mode in that it is highly productive, but the essential difference is that the high productivity is achieved effortlessly (which doesn't mean without any work)."  And then later:  "As far as moment-by-moment action is concerned, the mind will normally signal what to do by means of strong impulse as a green light, and resistance as an amber or red light.  What this boils down to is that you should do whatever you feel like doing at the time.  But note that this only works if you actually *are* in Pull Mode.  Otherwise you are going to find yourself drifting."  <br><br>Prior to AF, I wasn't quite sure how to apply some of the concepts in the book - initally, yes - but not to keep going on them given my mode of following something full bore for a couple of weeks, then dropping it to drift - repeat ad nauseum.  I think that AF is the missing piece providing a structure to keep me on track and in which to become more pull-oriented rather than push-oriented.  Between this and Michael Neill's "You Can Have What You Want" - another great book I wasn't sure how to apply - I think I'm due for a weekend break (without my current list along) to get down to basics and work through this stuff.<br><br>Anyway, if you haven't got the book, get it - it's really good.<br><br>As a side note - in looking for this book of Mark's, I ran across the 2 library books that had gone missing for over a couple of months past their due date that were on my AF list to find - and I also organized the bookcase while I was at it since I felt a strong urge to do so - organizing it was on my list, but not on the current page.  Also decluttered about a dozen other books (some on time management - buh bye) - that moves me towards my vision of an easily maintained, uncluttered home.  And moved all my "to be read" books to another shelf to be able to find them easily -another task complete albeit out of order. Sweet!  :-)<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br><br>Great post!  I think that AF really is the missing link - you and I have obviously both experienced those times when we have been "in the flow", "pull mode" or "having a woo-woo day?" without knowing how to maintain it.  AF is like one of those "aha" moments where everything suddenly starts to make sense.<br><br>Congratulations on the completed book related tasks!</div>

<div class="content">After reading about 1/3 of the way through "How to Make Your Dreams Come True" again (with a little more insight now), I deliberately took a different approach to my home reno.   <br><br>I decided to start with a vision of what I wanted my library bookshelves to look like.  So this afternoon, I went to the local decorating store to find an item that would look great on the shelves when they were finished.  <br><br>To be specific - I have built-in bookshelves bordering a fireplace in the library in my house.  Pre-Jan. 5, they were packed full - and I mean full - of books, which is what they're for, but it wasn't particularly aesthetically pleasing.   I've been giving away alot of the books, which is great.  We had already painted the shelves about 2 weeks ago, but I hadn't finished the touching up and hadn't put up the shelves.  And once I had the paint brush out anyway, I decided to finish up some of the trim as well.  Having that item to put on the shelves made all the difference in my motivation to finish up the task.  I scavenged some other items from other rooms that would also suit the theme of the room and I'm happy to say that it looks great.  This week, I'll be searching for some really neat bookends to complete the look.  And I'm ending the evening energized, not exhausted.<br><br>Having had an effortless and really fun evening accomplishing things, I'm now wondering if it isn't advisable to go out of order with the list every once in awhile to maintain flow.  And perhaps to start with a vision of what I want to have achieved rather than focusing so much on the list itself.<br><br></div>
