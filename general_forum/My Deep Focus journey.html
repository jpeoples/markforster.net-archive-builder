<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2014-01-1 6:06</div>
<div class="content">Happy New Year!<br><br>I thought I’d give an update on where the “first things first” journey has taken me in the last three months.   <br><br>(Cf. this thread:   <a href="../general_forum/First things first, and second things not at all (Peter Drucker).html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2180093</a> where I wrote a lot about focusing on the "one most important thing", an idea promoted by Peter F. Drucker and developed by many, many others)<br><br>In October, my job went through some changes which made it very difficult to set aside large time blocks in any consistent manner.   This made it really hard to block out focus time.   When I did manage to force a 2-hour block of time into my schedule, I never quite knew what to do with it when I had it!   The time would arrive, and I’d be so drained and scattered from the constant meetings and fast pace of the rest of my day, that I just could not focus.   So, this “focus time” became “check email and surf the internet” time – a big waste.<br><br>In the past, this would have led to a “stop, reset everything, and start over” event.   But I was really convinced of the value of focus time.   I just had to figure out how to make it work with the demands of my work, family life, volunteer work, and health issues.   It can’t all be based on following time blocks in a calendar – that just isn’t flexible enough for me.<br><br>I also found that I could not focus on “just one thing”, because I have three main areas of life that all need to be addressed:  family, work, and volunteer stuff.   As long as one area needed real focus, and the other two could wait, the “focus on one thing at a time” idea worked OK – I could spend all my waking time obsessing over that one thing, and all the meetings and tasks would just be temporary distractions.   But that kind of situation, with only one area needing immediate focus, was rare.   More realistically, I’d have a few pressing priorities in each of these three areas.    I needed some methodical way to handle this, with more flexibility than simple time-blocking.<br><br>So I kept exploring, not trying to find “the perfect system”, but rather trying to see what kind of ideas I could pick up that would help me forcefully insert more focus time into my life.<br><br>I’ve been finding all kinds of very useful things, and thought I’d start sharing them with the forum here.   There is too much to dump on you all at once, so I will spread it out in bite-sized chunks over the next several days.   I'll post the first one here soon.</div>

<div class="content">Looking forward as well.<br><br>I'm still going strong with my analog tools and rules. Mark's spirit flows through the process - specifically "little and often" and "intuition/standing out". A few more days of this and I'll post a scan of a typical day.</div>

<div class="content">Mark and Avrum, I will do my best to oblige.  :-)<br><br>I'll call this next post "Putting the inbox in its place"...<br><br>Like Alan Baljeu said (<a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2180093#post2183876" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2180093#post2183876</a> ), whenever he tried the “deep focus” approach, “the result is great progress on some things and a great mess everywhere else”.   The “great mess” part was really causing problems for me.   The part of my day filled with meetings, interruptions, and one-off action items, was draining all my energy.   So I tried to figure out how to get it under control.<br><br>I had already established a basic principle:   I did NOT want an “inbox-driven life”; I did NOT want “Zen and the Art of Inbox Management” (the original title of GTD!).    Rather, I wanted to find a way to focus on the strategic things that would have the most impact in my life and work.   This principle took a very specific form:   clearing my Inbox should take no more than an hour per day.  That includes reading the emails, paper mail, and other stuff that appears in my life, and it also includes dealing with all the random tasks that these things generate.  I’ve managed make this work as follows:<br>(1) Schedule a half-hour block first thing in the morning, and another half-hour block at the end of the day<br>(2) During these blocks, do a quick “email triage”:  delete, archive, set aside for Reading, set aside for Quick Tasks, or set aside for Project Work.  With this “triage” approach, I can clear 100 emails in 10-15 minutes.<br>(3) Clear out the Project Work emails – move them to OneNote or whatever the system is for that project, and deal with them later, in the context of that project.   These are for emails and tasks that are part of an already-existing project.<br>(4) Bang through the Quick Tasks, usually just straight through, top to bottom, get them all done or delete them.<br>(5) Stop immediately when the 30 minute time block is done<br><br>I also try to do the email triage whenever I have a few minutes spare time, such as waiting in queue somewhere.   It’s fast and easy and I can do it on my phone.<br><br>For personal emails and papers, I basically do the same thing:   quick triage during the day when I have a few moments, at lunchtime perhaps.   Then complete any remaining triage, and finish all the Quick Tasks, in the evening when I have time.    I’ll talk more about this later.<br><br>This has turned out to be very efficient, especially the “triage” idea.    <br><br>But how does any of this help with “deep focus”?<br><br>While reading Drucker and others on the “focus work” idea, they all talked about taking time away from all the hustle and bustle, to think more deeply about one’s work and what’s really important, then focus one’s energies on that.   Notice they didn’t recommend “capturing all your inputs” – but exactly the opposite, getting AWAY from all your inputs, so you can think and reflect.   I found this to be really important.   <br><br>Whole systems are built around handling one's inputs.   I think GTD is the quintessential example.   They focus on keeping your inbox empty, processing inputs efficiently, routing them correctly, pushing them forward to completion.   <br><br>But what if your inputs completely VANISHED?   I think many of us would feel totally lost.   I get that way during light periods at work, when lots of people are out of office for a holiday or something.   There’s all this free time and I don’t know what to do with myself.   I am accustomed to being the Inbox Ninja, but if nothing shows up in the inbox, what’s an Inbox Ninja to do?<br><br>I think this is a symptom that our focus is on the wrong place – the big strategic ideas that will move me forward in my life and work DON’T SHOW UP IN MY INBOX.   I can find them only with thinking, reflection, experimenting, testing. <br><br>The inbox is mainly a distraction from that, so it should be treated as such.  It needs to be handled effectively, but it should not be the centerpiece.   Neither should our lists – they tend to be rehashed and reprocessed inbox material.  By defining a clear, simple, and quick process for handling the inputs, and setting aside a specific and SMALL amount of time to handle it, I stay on top of it but keep it in its place.<br><br>OK, so far so good – that process has worked very well.   But after I got it established, I still needed a way to handle all the multiple priorities and projects in my life, and figure out how to get focus time for the most important ones.   I’ll deal with that next.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Seraphim<br>My modified version of DIT does that for me because Mark's principles and basic structure of DIT is almost fail proof. Between the projects queue and the current Initiative which is governed by commitments vs interests and the fact that you can alter how you actually DIT to accomodate your current responsibilities and objectives, all I need to worry about finding both the inclination and the time to complete my chosen MITs....yes, some MITs are things that I don't enjoy doing but, none the less, I've chosen to uphold my values.  Then I'm home free to focus on my projects or treat myself to work further on my Current Initiative.  As I juggle all of this, my mind is being entertained and/or challenged.  The cherry on top is completing your CI and choosing the next project in the queue that gets that prime priority as the other projects are moving along also and the scut is keep at bay (hopefully....sometimes life throws stuff at you at machine gun speed.  DIT handles all of it.  Of course, I'm not implying that keeping up and moving forward is a cake walk with DIT but DIT provides a DOABLE overview.<br><br>Mark I'm so grateful to you for creating DIT and your extensive archives.  I'm also grateful that you attract such a great cyber community.</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>I also have to give much credit to Chris L. for writing those posts about constructing "project focused all in one book system."  I simply altered it to suit my DIT process. I don't restrict it to only a few projects.  Sometimes life forces many deadline driven projects on us.  Sometimes it's only a matter of prioritizing. Other times, I also have to crunch down harder and longer.  DIT allows me to choose wisely and to be prepared for meeting my responsibilities and challenges.  It only makes me appreciate my discretionary time all the more.!<br><br><a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/1636403#post1637249" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/1636403#post1637249</a><br><br>BTW, Happy 2014 to all.  I'm kicking Annus horribilis 2013 in the backside with glee...and scrambling to finish off the remaining pending stuff.  (Isn't it a kick in the pants to have to wait on somebody else to finish your own work?  LOL!)</div>

<div class="content">Learning - I agree that DIT is not as "inbox-driven" as many other systems, and it specifically addresses "focus work" with the Current Initiative idea.   DIT also puts a lot of emphasis on designing good systems to help deal with your specific work.   Those are both very valuable and I've kept those ideas, at least the core of those ideas.   And also, I've probably been happier with DIT than with any of Mark's other systems.   <br><br>But I still failed with DIT - my chronic overwhelm was always triggering "commitment audits", which were sometimes very helpful but also mentally draining and time-consuming.   <br><br>I also had a hard time dealing with my "tomorrow" list functioning as a "catch-all".  If you have a new thought, a new task, a new goal, whatever, it is all supposed to go onto the Tomorrow page, onto your Will Do list for tomorrow, and you will deal with ALL of it tomorrow.   Maybe all you do is say "I am committed to this" or "I should delete this", but you still must deal with it tomorrow.   That didn't work well for me -- I needed to find a way to tweak it, so my Will Do list included only the committed work.   Your MIT-based method for using DIT seems to do this very well.  But I couldn't get that to work for me for some reason.   I guess needed some way to process all the other stuff that I wasn't sure about.<br><br>In relation to this thread and the emphasis on the Focus Work, DIT provides a very good mechanism for Focus Work, in the Current Initiative.   But in practice I found I spent a lot more time processing my Will Do list than focusing on my Current Initiatives.   With the approach I am now trying to follow, I'd try to spend maybe an hour a day dealing with my Will Do list, and as much of the rest of the day as possible on my Current Initiatives.</div>

<div class="content">Alan - I am glad you find it interesting, and hope you can glean something useful for yourself in all this.   But I should warn that I am not really putting forth a system - just various things that have helped me find more time for focus work.   And a lot of it is probably very specific to my own and working style and situation.   If you find any of it helpful, I will be thrilled!!    :-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Seraphim<br>I modified it greatly because I think conceptually vs linearly.  Plus I hated everything going on tomorrow's list.  I'm a prioritizer and I think in categories. I also like some spontaneity!  My version of DIT is based on my weekly version.  I don't put most scut work on the list.  I consider that to be background work unless there's a deadline attached.  Each day I cull some MITs from my weekly list. I TRY to limit the scut to 90 minutes maximum per day. (It doesn't always work out that way.)  I like having the focus of completing my chosen MIT's with plenty of wiggle room.  Because my inclinations and abilities aren't static, I like the flexibility that my weekly version offers.  I also like choosing my day's priorities and doing them however I wish.  If a friend calls from out of town, I'm not going to decline an offer to visit because the list isn't complete or if I'm in too much pain, I'm not going to feel guilty or frantic.  It's a weekly plan!  I can juggle things however I want to.  Sometimes I'll crunch extra hard with some O.T. to get stuff out of the way for no grand purpose at all.  I just want the crappola out of the way so I can eat dinner in peace.  LOL!<br><br>I love that Mark's principles don't have to be rule driven.  I've never been good with arbitrarily following rules. I also love having an overview that spreads out like concentric circles.  My values, responsibilities, dreams, passions, friends, etc are my driving force.  I have a basic knowledge of how I want my week to look.  Many days my expectations are way off the mark!  I still try to complete my MITs and keep the scut current "enough".  Having the day's MIT's and the weekly MIT's on the other page keeps my mind at ease.  It assures me that on most days I'll also have time for the things of which I feel passion and/or pleasure. I can safely implement Mark's little and often rule when I need to and can safely hyper-focus without too much nagging about the other responsibilities.  Lucky for me, I can unabashedly leave my inbox untouched after I checked that there are no ticking bombs.  I have no compulsion to order it.  My compulsion is to do my MIT's and keep things current overall so that the rest of the time is truly mine.  Mark has taught me so much.  I love the little and often rule.<br><br>The projects queue helps me move things along while the current initiative is like a failsafe insurance policy.<br><br>My secret is both my weekly focus and my daily commitment to at least complete the MITs.  I can sort the emails, mail and phone messages as a break from the high stress work.  In fact, I can do whatever I want as long as I get my MIT's done and keep the scut current "enough".  LOL!<br><br>I've learned much on this site to accommodate being disabled.  Thank you all.  Even a brain-addled gimp such as I can be successful using Mark's principles and the many tips and work arounds I've learned from this excellent forum!  You all are sometimes amazing with your contributions.<br><br>Seraphim, thanks for sharing.  This is what makes this forum so helpful. <br><br>p.s. If this is a bit incoherent, blame on the New Year's liquid cheer.  *blush*</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>Seraphim, I totally relate to having a mind that's always buzzing with the excitement of possibilities.  I wish each day was a hundred hours long and humans had an average lifespan of a thousand years.  That's why I like working my plan.  I may curse through doing the boring parts but I love having discretionary time to freely play around with some ideas and I also love to goof off without worrying so much about the many things I have to do.  Little and often was a revelation to me.  I was taught to plow through things from beginning to end.  I get much more done using the little and often method. It prevents overwhelm.  When I feel too overwhelmed I'm in danger of blowing it all off!  LOL!  Creating a doable list also helps to prevent that.<br>I think our 24/7 experimental thinking is both a blessing and a curse.  LOL!</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>Seraphim, I'm sorry that I forgot your line<br>" I'd try to spend maybe an hour a day dealing with my Will Do list, and as much of the rest of the day as possible on my Current Initiatives. "<br><br>I'm never very articulate especially when I'm inebriated but my daily list is comprised of my MITs!  The scut is bundled separately unless I need a reminder such as doing a call back or put some fire under somebody's butt.  That's why I feel much freer.  I choose my MITs for the day.  It's not comprised of whatever comes in.  In fact, if I do nothing at all except for my MIT's, I'm still golden.  Some days I actually do only my MITs and unabashedly goof off to my heart's content the rest of the time.  LOL!  I'm safe overall if I follow the principles. Even when I'm backed against the wall mired in work, I do what I can.  I don't care about the state of my email because I plucked out the important stuff.  My filing can wait until Friday.  My MITs are getting done.  That's what actually matters.  I love trying to keep my scut work down to 90" daily overall.  Some days the entire day is scut.  Other days it's less than the 90 minutes.  I'm safe overall because I'm current overall.  I love the overall peace of mind that my bastardized version of DIT gives me.  Rules?  Bah!  Principles rule!</div>

<div class="content">I’ve been sick almost all week, and it has been a good opportunity to test how these techniques hold up under stress.<br><br>I have had a lot of things to do, both at work and at home.   But I’ve had a bad flu and headache for the last three days.   At first, I just panicked and wasn’t sure how to handle it all.   I saw my personal email backlog go through the roof (it comes in bursts, and this is one of the seasons for bursts!).   Also, since I was staying home but still trying to work for my job, I was pulled in three directions:  (1) work, (2) rest, and (3) catch up on the personal mess that was developing.   So at first, I basically did nothing:  random reading, checking work email, checking personal email, picking at this and that task, and sometimes trying to rest and deal with the illness.   <br><br>I was also frustrated with myself – I thought this kanban and calendar approach was robust enough to handle these downtimes!   What’s the problem here?!   I was especially frustrated with the growing volume of backlogged email – lots of these emails were “quick tasks”, but the pile of quick tasks was turning into an all-day mess to deal with.   That wasn’t supposed to happen!<br><br>I fell into old habits:   rather than actually follow my plan or work my kanban, I started googling around to find examples of kanban integrations with Gmail; I installed Trello on my iPhone and tried to see if I could send emails to it; I looked at three or four other kanban apps.   <br><br>But I’d done all that before!   There was really nothing new here.   Why was I doing all this???    There were no answers here.   AND I ALREADY KNEW THAT!!   <br><br>It was totally counterproductive.   The reason I like kanban, isn’t because it’s integrated with my email or because I can do it on my iPhone – it’s because I can see everything all in one place!    Doing it on the iPhone is trying to read my kanban file through a crack in the door, from across the room.   Portability is nice but that’s not why I’m doing kanban.   <br><br>And all this reading - I've read 90% of it before!    MORE READING ISN'T GOING TO HELP!!<br><br>So, I took a deep breath, backed up, and tried to see what was happening.   Ultimately, it came down to habits.   This is what I do when I get knocked down, either by health or other circumstances.   I feel overwhelmed and start looking for magical solutions to the overwhelm.   It’s a programmed behavior…   The trigger is overwhelm, the behavior is to go on a search for a new way to handle my work, and the reward is a bright shiny productivity toy that makes me happy for a few weeks.     <br><br>The thing is, I had already identified this behavior pattern.    I just haven’t re-programmed the behavior yet.    And with this latest episode of overwhelm, I'd fallen into the same old behavior.<br><br>All this is turning into a segue to one of my next posts – coming soon! – on the importance of identifying debilitating and destructive habits, and systematically reprogramming them, and how it helps achieve Deep Focus!    If you want a preview, you can see my previous post here:<br><a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2252333#post2258150" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2252333#post2258150</a><br><br>To counter this wrong reaction to overwhelm, I decided (at least for now) simply to turn to my calendar and my kanban and see what’s next.   OK, I’ve got a few Pomodoros, maybe 2 or 3 before I need to go rest…   And those emails are really bothering me!    One Pomodoro for Project X, and two for the emails…  GO!</div>

<div class="content">I Seraphim<br>I relate on both counts.  Being in pain and trying to recover (this time it was bone grafting) doesn't conjure up much impetus to work.  What gets me working while ignoring blood and sutures is plain old fear!  <br>Some destructive habits aren't simply learned.  I've had horrible problems with boredom since childhood.  There's NO CURE.  Every single time I have to approach dreaded work, the effort is many more times exhausting than doing the actual work.  I believe that some people are just plain wired this way.  The flip side of the coin is I'm wired for learning, creativity and problem solving. People have many different labels for this propensity. To me, it's simply how my brain works.  I already know that approaching the work won't be much easier than trying to give birth to a pineapple.  But what choice to we have unless we can trust somebody else to do it up to our standards.  I'm almost 63.  It feels no easier than when I was 5.  It's genetic!  My only rx is to alternate it with less onerous work BEFORE the stress causes my brains to splatter onto the ceiling, hold my nose and promise myself something compensatory to the agony LOL! or to hire out and make sure they do a decent job.  That's usually worse than doing it myself!  LOL!<br><br>I feel for you Seraphim.  You also have an active non-stop mind like I do.  Maybe we're not that different.  Sometimes I have to remind myself that this is the price I have to pay for having my mind.  Overall, the trade off is still worth it.<br><br>I hope you feel better soon.  Don't overdo and make yourself more sick, please.</div>

<div class="content">p.s.s.<br>Like you, an overview definitely reduces the stress and makes decision making  far easier.  I couldn't do AF because everything was jumbled up and I think in categories.  Unlike you, I can't work off a complete overview.  I isolate today's view and can quickly peek at the weekly view if I feel the need.  The only stress with the today view is getting myself to keep approaching over and over until I feel OK enough to stop for the day.  I absolutely need work arounds to keep approaching what I really don't want to do.  As effortful and bad as it feels, it still beats relying on only the fear of a too close deadline.  I need more wiggle room than that!  LOL!  Accepting that this is how it it in an odd way helps a little bit, but never enough!  LOL!</div>

That's why I keep my "collecting" page separate from the rest of my kanban.    When I'm in "review mode", looking over EVERYTHING, I have both pages up on the wall and can see it all in one place.   I decide what I want to COMMIT to right now, and move those things to Committed.<br><br>But then when I am actually WORKING, I totally ignore the "collecting" page and focus all my attention on the Committed, Today, and WIP tasks.   I only go back to look at Collecting again, when I feel that Committed has opened up enough slots to allow room for more work - or it starts feeling stale and needs a refresh.<br><br>I find if I keep checking "Collecting" while I am trying to WORK, it slows me down and I get all distracted and unfocused.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Seraphim<br>LOL!  I MUST avoid looking at all of my stuff except what I need to work on at least for the time block.  If I dislike what I'm working on enough I don't need the temptation of looking at great ideas I've cooked up or even the hare-brained ones.  I'll take it a step further.  Even cleaning the house could tempt me away from mind-numbing jobs that demand focus.....AAARRRGGGG!<br><br>They used to say that everybody's dorm was shipshape during finals.  We never knew why.  Now I know that it's structured procrastination.  LOL!<br><br>When things aren't as crunched as they have been the last few months, sometimes I don't even need to look at the ideas.  Sometimes it feels great just to relax, go out if I can, socialize or putter around doing NOTHING I hate!  LOL!  Once those MITs are done, I feel like a prisoner on a day release pass.  I'm not due back in my cell until the next day of work.  LOL!<br><br>You make me smile when you say it looks stale and needs a refresh.  I rarely feel like the work is stale.  I usually feel like it's far beyond stale. It's some form of torture because it's not only boring as hell but I have to actually  focus on it, concentrate and be accurate!  LOL! That's the hell of it. I have to concentrate and be accurate on something that bores me to tears   LOL! I'm so grateful when I've done enough of it so that I can switch gears!  LOL!  It almost makes casual goofing off feel like a sacred rite!<br><br>Thanks for sharing your cool system!</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>Conversely, if I'm challenged and/or interested I can go on a working binge for extremely long periods of time. My disabilities restrict me to a degree but if I'm in the zone, I can work for hours and hours on end until I notice that the sun is rising. It's like nothing else is in my awareness until I have to relieve myself.  LOL!  It's the boring stuff that's my nemesis.</div>

<div class="content">My "Deep Focus" journey has hit quite a few snags lately.   I keep running into the problem that Alan Baljeu described:  << I've done 1st 1st and 2nd never for a while, and the result is great progress on some things and a great mess everywhere else.  >>    ( <a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2180093#post2183876" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2180093#post2183876</a> )<br><br>I've found many of these techniques and tools are still valid, but I've needed to make some adjustments.<br><br>Example 1:  The Power of Habit - this is probably the most long-lasting powerful piece of my "journey" recently.   I'm just trying to figure out what my next new habit to attack should be.  :-)<br><br>Example 2:  personal kanban - I've started using it more to track project milestones and key tasks and deadlines, rather than to track all my open tasks.  I have a swimlane for each project, and I line up each major deadline in succession, in my "committed" column.   I can then move things forward to WIP, Waiting For, or DONE.   This is really helpful to remind me of my major commitments, and to see the overall status and what's coming next, all in a glance.   <br><br>But ultimately I found it to be too much overhead for managing individual tasks, especially when they are coming fast and furious.  The highly optimized Pomodoro routine also just wasn't really sustainable.   It doesn't work well when only 1 or 2 Pomodoros make themselves available each day, as a result of meeting overload, inbox overload, and priorities and projects changing daily because of forces outside my control.<br><br>I've enjoyed experimenting with everyone else on the "task randomizer" ideas.  This has helped get through a lot of the chaos generated by the overload.   In one day I knocked a list of 125 tasks down to about 30  (only about 20% of that was outright deletion, the rest was action!).</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the update.<br><br>Do your swim lanes look like a Gantt chart? Traditionally it's projects and sub-projects down the left, dates across the top, then symbols for deadlines and milestones and bars for the dates you expect to work on things. (I sometimes combine sub-projects on a single line and label each part of the bar. It depends how long the page gets and how linear the project is.)<br><br>If so, maybe stick a pin in each bar to indicate where you are. Ideally, all the pins will be in today's column.<br><br>There are a lot of variations, some with different names. Sometimes the bars are coloured by person or resource, sometimes the rows are by resource and sub-project by note on the bar. The main thing is to show connections. There are several programs that automate creating many of the traditional charts, and make a few more.<br><br>My own milestone chart is a variation, and it's saved my sanity often.</div>

<div class="content">It's a little like a Gantt chart, but in reverse chronological order - it works better with the way a kanban "pulls" work forward.<br><br>For example, see here:<br>https://www.dropbox.com/sc/ool04xgh275dgvy/UL-2QUcdSG<br><br>In the Committed column, I write down the major milestones/deadlines.  I line them up so that the "next actions" are rightmost.   The best example is the third project from the top:  "CIDM Presentation".   <br><br>I try to preserve the swimlans for WIP, Waiting For, and Done, but there isn't any chronological order there.</div>

<div class="content">Neat! Project down left. Status across. Tasks on stickies that move.<br><br>Swim-lane confused me. Your stickies change lanes rather than follow the lane.</div>
<h2>Reply by Seraphim</h2>
<div class="meta">2014-02-12 20:41</div>
<div class="content">Well, no, not really, they do stay in their lane as they move from Committed to WIP / Waiting For to Done.<br><br>For example, in my third project in the folder, "CIDM Presentation":<br><br>Starting from the right, there is one task on hold - I am waiting for approval for travel, before I continue making travel arrangements.   So that task is in the "Waiting For" column.   When I get travel approval, this will most likely move left to WIP, and then I'll finish up the task.<br><br>Then, moving to the left, there's a task in WIP called "Draft slides due 2/14" - I am currently preparing these slides, they are due this Friday.   When that is done, I'll move the task to the right to DONE.<br><br>When those two tasks are done, it frees up space for the next task, which is "Final Slides due 3/14".   When I'm ready to work on it, I'll move it forward to WIP.   I'd also slide the "Travel and Hotel Info due 4/10" forward a bit, but staying within the Committed column till I'm actually ready to work on it.<br><br>It helps to think of a kanban like an assembly line, flowing from left to right.  All the tasks are lined up in order so when space opens up, they can be pulled forward.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Seraphim<br>Ideally, we just work down the list.  Other times, I'm actually not up to it.<br>A situational workaround is using a work around vs just hammering out the work on the list.  Example: I'm feeling intense pain but I need to keep working.  I might make a short list of a few tasks that may be one or two steps long and throw in a couple that won't be affected by the pain.  I don't need intelligence to do laundry but I might do a few steps toward writing an article with a deadline.  Example to accommodate pain bout<br><br>sort laundry <br>start a load<br>set up desk for writing article<br>-what I've written so far<br>-notes<br>-index cards with footnotes<br>-reference materials<br>-ideas sheet<br>-make sure everything is set to make dinner<br>-wash vegetables<br>-cut vegetables<br>-cut meat<br>-dry measurements<br>_________________________<br><br>-review what I've written<br>-review index cards<br>-review notes<br>-sit and let it sink in<br>clothes to dryer<br><br>I just keep going like that hoping for relief.  Sometimes relief occurs spontaneously. YAY!  Other times I just have keep throwing breadcrumbs to get me there despite the pain.<br><br>If the pain is bad enough to require drugs, the article must wait.  That's why I try to keep current or ahead as much as possible.  I used to do it to invite opportunities.  Now I do it because I never know when the pain is bad enough to derail me for mental work requiring focus and thinking.  I'm a dumb mule.  I can do almost any kind physical work through pain if necessary. I'd rather do what I can when I can.  Also, sometimes when the pain subsides, I choose to use the opportunity to.....gasp....do something pleasurable.  I don't want the ghost of undone work to spoil the mood!  LOL!  <br><br>Bottom line: using a situational workaround is using whatever means necessary to get myself over the hump.  It's also getting myself back on track when I've drifted off.  LOL!</div>
