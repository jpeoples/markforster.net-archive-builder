<div class="content">We've now established that we can make AF1 more effective within the existing rules by starting each day on the page where the first entry for the previous day is located. <br><br>So the question now is whether we can make it even more effective by changing some of the rules.<br><br>I've got a few ideas. How about anyone else?</div>

<div class="content">(1)  Make the new daily starting place part of the official rules -- or at least add it to the suggested DOs and DON'Ts.<br><br>(2)  Make the AF1 rules themselves easier to find -- perhaps even superseding Superfocus in the Place of Prominence at the top of your site's pages.   (After 1 day of working this way, I find it flows much better than SF, though I haven't attempted War and Peace yet!)<br><br>That's all for now...</div>

<div class="content">I would like a better rule for dismissing more stuff and integrating review into the flow. For the latter I would suggest AF4 type review next time you come about to the diissed page. I don't have a good idea to promote more frequent dismissal.</div>

<div class="content">I would suggest <br>- Flags the most important items, urgent and unfinished<br>- Report all yours must do task on today's list<br>- Start by today's date and by these reported items<br>- If a task is a project put the project in parenthesis<br>- When there is a due date about a task put it at the end of the task and report it on your diary if it is a dead line or something you absolutely must do<br>- Put everything in the list one by one and at night report what must be on yours projects or diary. Don t hesitate to put ideas like someday I will or reformulations about yours items. <br><br>That's all for me for the moment</div>

<div class="content">- if you don't get through your list x times in a day, dismiss the oldest pages until only y are left.<br><br>The values of x and y will probably differ from person to person, but I'd think 3 would be a reasonable starting value.</div>

<div class="content">I like the concept Will, but the execution is awkward.  There are days when only 1 hour is available, and days when 8 hours are available.  I'd think you need to find an average over several days, only then it becomes a chore to calculate.</div>

<div class="content">Differentiate unfinished vs. brand new tasks for dismissal similar to DWM. Once one commits to a task/project I think it makes sense that these items should be under scrutiny and subject to more aggressive dismissal policy. <br><br>Right now AF1 does not distinguish these. SF does so with column 2 but was too restrictive. I liked DWM’s timed (1 week of inactivity) dismissal as they fall somewhere in the middle. This should be easy to incorporate if one begins to note dates on the pages.<br><br>GC</div>

<div class="content">How about using the 1st pass through all the items on the page to mark the ones that have a "negative feeling" or offer "high resistance" with some sort of sign, as discussed recently in the "AF1 PLUS-OR-MINUS" thread: <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1677406" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1677406</a><br><br>When leaving the page (if the page wasn't dismissed), the ones marked in the 1st pass would be crossed out and rewritten at the end, in a way that cuts them smaller… see examples in <a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2006/9/9/plus-or-minus.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2006/9/9/plus-or-minus.html</a><br><br>I haven't tested this (it's all theory) but maybe:<br>• over time, the entire list would progressively tend towards lower resistance tasks.<br>• the effort is low and it doesn't get tiring because the auditing/reviewing is embedded in the normal day-to-day processing of each page.<br>• each "rewrite" can be done quickly (it doesn't have to be perfect) because we'll get to reevaluate it again when the last page is reached.<br><br>Could interfere though with the "starting each day on the page for the previous day" by polluting the "fresh and current" feeling of that tweak.</div>

<div class="content">I tried something which is interesting I submit to you. <br>- At the beginning of the day put today's date just at the top middle page<br>- Then work by project and put everything which comes to your mind and which arrives little by little about the project during the day. The methode is to work by project and do the most you can about it grouping all you can in the same paragraphs<br><br>example<br><br>(PROJECT X) <br>Do this,<br>Waiting for that on monday<br>New idea : May be I could do this and that<br>Call X and Y / Make them agree the owner point of view<br>Tomorrow do this <br>Beware of that <br><br>(Project Y) <br>Someday I could do this or that<br><br>NOTES about ....<br><br>The result is a great focus on a project and a good advancement on the project little by little. <br>There is also an increasement of the efficiency and the vision about the project because all tasks relatives to projects are grouped together and it force you to close or eliminate the project the sooner possible. <br><br>It is just a test, for the moment.</div>

<div class="content">If the change is made to restart each day at Yesterday, the gap between where you paused yesterday, and the place you resume today ought to be processed by something like the quote below:<br><br>"DO read through all the outstanding items on your list when you come back to it after an extended break. This will help your mind to get an overview of what needs to be done."</div>

I think that this has to do with the magic of the Free-Form.  If you are having a mind dump concerning a specific theme or project (i.e., you want to keep things grouped), it can all go in one place and in the index (period).  It is embedded, so you can get it all out, and forget about it.<br><br>Whatever you decide to put in AF to remind you about your 'special project' depends on how important it is to you to follow up, postpone it, add to it, drop it, etc.</div>

<div class="content">I've been using AF1 with three changes. I use a small 3.5" x 5.5" notebook with 29 lines per page.  I treat two facing pages as one page (closed list), so there are 58 lines on a "page". The changes are:<br><br>1. Work items go from the top of the list downward, home items go from the bottom of the list upward. See <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1577123#post1580873" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1577123#post1580873</a><br><br>2. I start each day on the last page of the list, where the most recent items are.<br><br>3. I'm keeping my list to no more than four pages (four pairs of facing pages). Once I go over that number I aggressively work or dismiss the oldest items on the list to get back to four pages.<br><br>Why four? A couple of months ago I decided to make my list short and simple (KISS). I knew it wasn't short and I wanted to know how not-short it was. I took a blank piece of paper and drew boxes to represent each page and wrote the number of open tasks in each box. I was shocked at what I saw - I had so many open pages it was no wonder I was resisting moving through the entire list in a day. So I began cutting down one page at a time until I got to a comfortable number.  For me, that number is four.</div>

<div class="content">Simpler than AF1, preserves momentum, and develops threads of action!  Here's my take on Mark's idea: <br>Instead of working Pages, work on Closed Lists of arbitrary size which I'll name Sections.  This substitution into the rules of AF1 improves work coherence and simplifies rule 7.  I'm not sure it will work in practice.  Below are the rewritten rules of AF1.<br><br>Write all your tasks in a list.  Draw a line below that list, creating a closed section, and starting a second (initially empty) list.  (Existing AF1 users, initially each page is a Section.)<br>As you think of new items, add them to the last section. You work through the list one section at a time in the following manner:<br><br>1. Read quickly through all the items of a section without taking action on any of them.<br>2. Go through the section more slowly looking at the items in order until one stands out for you.<br>3. Work on that item for as long as you feel like doing so<br>4. Cross the item out.  If you haven’t finished it, re-enter it in the last section.<br>5. Continue going round the same section in the same way.   Don’t move onto the next section until you complete a pass of the section without any item standing out.<br>6. Move onto the next section and repeat the process<br>7. If you go to a section and no item stands out for you on your first pass through it, highlight all remaining items as dismissed.<br>8. Once you’ve finished with the final section, draw a line to close it and start a new section, and re-start at the first section that is still active.</div>

<div class="content">Alan -- That's basically what I do in my OneNote implementation, basically an artifact of the medium.   But I don't see how it (1) is simpler than AF1, (2) preserves momentum, or (3) develops thread of action.<br><br>Can you elaborate?</div>

<div class="content">Instead of each page being a closed list, treat each day as a closed list.<br><br>Alternatively, everything before yesterday is treated as a backlog, like AF4. So everything before the beginning of yesterday is cycled once, then everything since the beginning of yesterday is worked round and round until nothing stands out. Then back to once round the backlog.</div>

<div class="meta">2012-01-4 23:05</div>
<div class="content">Here's a very minor improvement on the start-today-on-yesterday's-first-page rule.<br><br>When you start AF1 for the day, draw a heavy horizontal line across the page, after the last item on the last page.   Write today's date in the margin next to the first item that you enter today.<br><br>It just gives a little more emphasis to that starting point, and allows you to see more easily how much stuff gets entered each day.</div>

<div class="meta">2012-01-4 23:18</div>
<div class="content">Seraphim, reread rule 8.  Each pass through the list generates a new section.  So each section IS a collection of things you did in one pass.  This means there's no need to deal with stubby pages at the end that get processed in isolation.  I suspect further changes would be made to suit this fact, simplifying more, but I hesitate to diverge too far from AF1.</div>

<div class="content">Alan:<br><br>I've tried your idea quite recently, and found it doesn't really offer any advantages over AF1. In fact it just makes it slightly more difficult to work because of the irregular page lengths.<br><br>Wooba:<br><br>I've tried your idea of the closed list per day too. With similar results to Alan's idea.<br><br>And I've tried your other idea too, and thought it would be quite promising initially. But it proved to be disappointing.</div>

<div class="meta">2012-01-5 1:59</div>
<div class="content">Toward the "action threads" concept:<br><br>Limit one new action thread per closed page - when working a closed page, you can complete as many items as you like, but as soon as you take any partial action (rewriting the Unfinished item at the end of the list), turn the page. Upon reaching the open page, work it as per regular AF, taking as much action as you want until nothing stands out.<br><br>I imagine this will keep the open page to a focused list of hot items, receiving ample attention each time we reach the end of the list.<br><br>I also find it helps to rewrite Unfinished items with a small open circle out front. This notation alone—without an actual rule—helps them to stand out, as I always want to wrap up what I have started.</div>
<h2>Reply by Alan Baljeu</h2>
<div class="meta">2012-01-5 6:07</div>
<div class="content">Staying within AF1 characteristics of single entry point, page boundaries. A thread is most naturally constructed by writing consecutive tasks at the end. This suggests a pong-ping process of collecting and generating related tasks and working them. <br><br>1. Read quickly through all the items on the page, marking those that stand out.<br>2. If no marks, dismiss the page.<br>3. go through the marked items.  Work on any items for as long as you feel like doing so.<br>5. Cross worked items off the list; re-enter at the end of the list if not finished<br>6. Switch to the last page and do any.<br>7. Continue alternating marked page and back page until no more tasks stand out on the former.<br>8. Move onto the next page and repeat the process.<br>9. Once you’ve finished with the final page, re-start at the first page that is still active.<br><br>Of course there are a hundred details that can be adjusted from here.</div>

Not necessarily a new rule, but an expectation of how many times you should expect to get through the list in an average day, and an expectation of how many pages you should expect to have. <br><br>If you're getting through the list five or six times a day, you really don't need more than the basic system.</div>

<div class="content">Just a Tip I tried with a great success. <br><br>Problem : I work on many crucial project and need to know at a glance the advancement. <br>If I put it in AF list they are drowned in the task and I can't focus on it. <br><br>Solution. <br>Take your paper notebook use AF list as usual. Write AF list only on the left page. Reserve the right page for jotting notes, ideas and so on. <br><br>Take a new page and list all yours crucial projects on by one like you do with AF.<br>In front of each project listed on this page, put in a word where you are are where you go <br>Then little by little report each project and see the advancement of the project. <br>It is simple and it works.</div>

<div class="content">Three things:<br><br>1) I use the same modification as Zane.  My book is used for capturing notes, diagrams and everything so my AF pages were very much scattered around and a pain to track (I used post-it tabs but got tired of nursing them).  This led to stress and resistance to process things.<br><br>Now I simply mark 4 adjacent pages (32 lines each) as AF and put a postit tab at the start.  I can now find all my AF tasks here.  When I need to go beyond those I mark another 4 adjacent pages but leave the marker alone.  I resolve to get my existing pages down to just a few remaining items before I allow myself to move across.  I essentially work the existing pages as a closed AF list until it's done.<br><br>This helps to keep things moving without allowing things to sprawl, and ensures the book is a lot easier to navigate.<br><br>2) Ditch the highlighter and arrange for dismissal to be simpler so everything can be done with a pen.  I put a little dash at the start of each entry.  To dismiss I circle the remaining dashes and can see at a glance that the page has them on.  If the page is finished with I put a cross at the top.  Much easier.<br><br>3) I'm not following the modification which Mark opened with.  Where did it come from, can someone explain it fully, and how does it help?  Thanks.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Chris</div>

<div class="content">Chris,<br><br>Yes, you have to mark the beginning of each day in your notebook. I make an underscore in the left margin, on the ruled line separating the days, and I write the date number underneath that mark, to the left of the day's first item.<br><br>The new method is hardly a change at all: when you first pick up your notebook for the day, turn to the page which contains yesterday's first entry, and continue working as normal from that page.

<div class="content">From my point of view, I had the most problems with dismissal.  I did not like the idea of dismissing entire pages, as the idea was to put everything into the system.  If everything is in AF, things may "live" for awhile until they are actioned.  Additionally, intuitively I don't like the idea of highlighting dismissed items, as it highlights what you just said you are not doing.<br><br>Nuntym, I like the general idea of introducing a concept to make action more the focus by using different words, however I think what you want is to simplify the task or shorten it to make it doable.   <br><br>I came up with these modifications trying not to add too many rules.<br><br><br>1)	Read quickly through all the items on the page without taking action on any of them.<br>2)	Go through the page more slowly looking at the items in order until one stands out for you.  Stand out means one of two things<br>a)	You know it no longer needs to be done and you cross it out<br>b)	The item needs to be done now and you:	<br>i)	Work on that item for as long as you feel like doing so<br>ii)	When done working on it, cross the item off the list paying attention to the following rules:<br>(a)	If you haven’t finished it, re-enter it at the end of the list using a new description of a task you believe can now be finished in one sitting. <br>(b)	If the task is finished and related to a bigger project, add the next logical step/task needed to complete the project to the end of the list<br>3)	Continue going round the same page in the same way. Don’t move onto the next page until you complete a pass of the page without any item standing out<br>4)	Move onto the next page and repeat the process<br>5)	Once you’ve finished with the final page, re-start at the first page that is still active<br><br>Tips<br><br>Only use this system and make sure to include everything on this list<br>When the notebook is filled up, start fresh to ensure at least a few reviews a year.<br><br>Good luck <br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">Back to the original question about "changing some of the rules," I haven't really changed them, but rather added some routines to make the whole process more effective.  In no particular order. . . <br><br>1. Number each page and number each task entry. This makes it easy to refer to related tasks across pages.<br><br>2. Use a multipen to separate contexts by ink color.  I use blue for home-related and black for work-related tasks.  I also use green to mark and cross-out any urgent task done out of order (not on the current page), in the spirit of the common-sense rule (If something needs doing immediately, just do it).<br><br>3. Enter AF1 pages among other pages of notes, lists, drawings, etc. in a bound FreeForm notebook. Put an Index/ToC on p. 1 to keep track of what pages are where.  Use a pencil to make previous/next "links" at the bottom of each AF1 page (since these links will change as pages are added & dismissed).<br><br>4. Assess level of resistance (see "Plus or Minus" topic) of each task at initial page scan, and delete or rewrite high-resistance tasks before leaving the page.  Reduces number of remaining tasks at page dismissal.<br><br>5. Make checklists for routine things such as filing, processing papers, clearing email Inbox, packing essential items going to/from work, etc. Rather than entering all these repetitive routine tasks and reminders in AF1, I just enter CLa, CLb, etc. for my morning, after-lunch, etc. checklists, and then tick them off the corresponding checklists. This was another topic/blog-post written by Mark awhile ago that resurfaced recently.  Makes the AF1 list less trivial.<br><br>6. Choose three tasks from the list for special focus each day. These should be nontrivial and/or related to specific projects or goals you are working on.  The Big Three can be entered on a side list, jotted on your calendar, or just marked in some way directly on the AF1 list.  Celebrate another successful day and give yourself permission to quit "working the list" when you've made progress on all three.<br><br>That's all for now!</div>

<div class="content">Okay, I'll bite. One of the really complicated things about AF1 is that you have to scan each page TWICE before you can get going. So complicated!  The second scan must be slow and deliberate, in order for something to stand out.  Why not simplify the process by making only ONE scan per page?  And we could further simplify by not waiting for anything to stand out. Just take some action on each task, in the order listed – much simpler! One valid action would be deleting the task, or rewriting it at the end, in a way that would offer less resistance (you hope).  With these new rules, the whole page would be processed in one go! No more circling around. Just go from page to page, and get everything done!</div>

<div class="content">More radical, and simpler than AF1:<br><br>Consider the last page as a worksheet.  Always focus on this page.<br>a. Any time you think of a task, write it here.<br>b. Any time you pick a task to work on, write it here, do it, and cross-out the original. <br>c. When a task is finished, flag it, meaning Seraphim's "Finished - what's next?"<br><br>Processing: <br>1. Scan through the last two pages picking tasks according to rule b.  Repeat until nothing stands out.<br>2. Scan through older pages one at a time, resuming from the last marked place.<br>- If nothing stands out on a page, dismiss it, and go to the next page.<br>- If some tasks stand out, do them according to rule b.  Then bookmark that page, and return to step 1.</div>

<div class="content">The immediate effect of abolishing the dismissal rule is that AF1 lists would quickly grow out of control.  It would also free operators to fly more quickly through the list because the fear of dismissal is gone.  This wouldn't however mean more things are done, just more things read.  However, it would enable an operator to focus on one sort of task for a while and get all kinds of related tasks done.  Then you add the 30 day dismissal rule and you have DWM2.</div>

<div class="content">Mark, with respect this is coming across more like you're looking for validation of your own existing beliefs and less like you're soliciting new ideas.  People are posting the AF mods which work (or would work) for them.  What appears more complex to you may well be a reduction in complexity for the person posting.  In my case the additional groupings I make in the book add minor complexity to the raw process but massively reduce complexity in use.<br><br>There is no such thing as "a system" which works for everyone.  GTD works well because it's a broad, adaptable framework.  People appear to be using AF in a similar way which means you can expect various hacks to take place so that individuals can mould it to a system which meets their own requirements.  This is a Good Thing, a testament to the flexibility of a simple basic framework which, for some people, will work just as it is.</div>

<div class="content">Before responding to Alan, I hope everyone realizes that my previous post above was a (perhaps lame) attempt at humor.  I was trying to be as outrageous as possible.  But I still might try it!  ;-)<br><br>Alan states that "The immediate effect of abolishing the dismissal rule is that AF1 lists would quickly grow out of control."  But this isn't necessarily true.  You can always choose to delete a task, and this deletion is a valid action.  This stale-task deletion would be a result of negative standing out, and you can be as ruthless as you want in killing as many tasks as possible on every page visit.  The previous dismiss/highlight-wait-review-delete/rewrite process might have some advantages for self-realization, but it could be seen as an unnecessary complication.</div>

<div class="content">Here are some of my own answers to the question "What would the effect be of abolishing the dismissal rule in AF1?"<br><br>I asked the question in the context of ongoing discussion on the forum about focusing more on what one is doing than on what one has not done. <br><br>Removing the dismissal rule would immediately readjust this balance. The dismissal rule is all about doing things which haven't been done in order to avoid other things from being dismissed because one hasn't done them. And when dismissal takes place then one has only succeeded in producing another list of things which haven't been done.<br><br>At present the emphasis on every page except the last few of an AF1 list is on what one hasn't done. Removing the dismissal rule will allow focus on what is going on - including which tasks on earlier pages now feel ready to be done, not because they have to be done but because they genuinely will fit into the current situation.<br><br>What about Alan's statement that "The immediate effect of abolishing the dismissal rule is that AF1 lists would quickly grow out of control"?<br><br>I don't think it would effect pages until a late stage in their history because a large proportion of the tasks on most pages will get done anyway - dismissal rule or no dismissal rule. It's only the few at the end that are likely to cause the problem.<br><br>However one thing to note is that, if you don't have a dismissal rule, then there is no reason why you need to maintain tasks on the same page they began their life on. That allows consolidation of tasks which aren't going anywhere onto one page (or more), and this should reduce the number of pages involved considerably.<br><br>And of course one hopes that the removal of the threat of dismissal will encourage a more thorough approach to the question of whether the task needs to be done at all or should be deleted (as ubi reminds us).</div>
