<div class="content">Something I've been pondering over recently is exactly what is it that drives us to fear dismissing tasks?<br><br>In the AF systems, it is that fear that keeps us moving back to those older tasks that we have been procrastinating over to try and "save them" from their ultimate fate (dismissal).<br><br>And yet those same tasks may have previously been sitting on our todo lists for days, weeks, months, even years, without any concern from us. But when it comes down to making a decision to let go, it suddenly becomes very difficult.<br><br>So where does this fear of letting go of these tasks come from?<br><br>We all seem to have it to some extent otherwise these systems wouldn't work. Any thoughts?</div>

<div class="content">Perfectionist tendencies, the fear of losing control, of losing out if this is one task that will mean a lot in the end even if you don't know it now, fear of failure because dismissal means you can't handle a task load?<br><br>Just some random thoughts, because at one point or another, I experienced some of these feelings in one way or another when dimissing a task!<br><br>Today was an example of one such task. A biggie when I first penned it, I thought. But it lost it's value and vitality over a period of time, and I gave it a decent burial. Once the mourning was over, I had an immense feeling of release and power. Yes! I'm bigger than you are. But just in case you're important in the future, I'll add a task, "review dismissed tasks' at the end of the list :)</div>

<div class="content">Frank, I think we fear dismissing because we translate it as we will *never* do that.  eg. I will NEVER read Chapter 2 of 1984.  And that seems intolerable.  <br><br>I don't review dismissed tasks - I figure if they're important enough, they'll come up again.  And I've probably dismissed more than anyone on this forum.  I've come to enjoy it, it's part of the filtering - as it should be.  The way I phrase it though is to tell myself "not right now, you have other, more important things to do. Doing this will take precious time away from those important things."  <br><br>Those items that can easily be dismissed and are not are simply *clutter* - they're keeping us from doing what's more important.  It's a sign that someone doesn't know what their priorities - or limits - are.  Everything cannot be a priority, and we do not have infinite time.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">I love to dismiss! Throw the whole lot out I say. I have way too many ideas and crazy plans. I am often overwhelmed. In other systems, even DIT I ened up with onenote or notebooks of ideas/tasks that for GTD would be SDMB, or even SDN (some day never). <br><br>When using AF I would count a dismissal as doing something on that page. That is very motivating! <br><br>I have an AF list going back to Dec 08. Which I know is pre AF. I started to add items from my task diary I was not doing to a master list. I would then spend some time each day trying to get some of it done. Because I know I have too many ideas/plans I was adding things in my task diary a month ahead, thinking I would review/do it then. But there was never time. So I ended up with a growing backlog pile that I kind of worked on as a mini project. And then I saw AF and there was a better way of doing the second lot of filters - ie dismissing things.<br><br>i have not gone back to my dismissed items. Like Jacqueline I think they will come up again. They usually do. But now I feel less like I am always looking after my lists. And I have got quite a bit done. Though I am thinking of going back to AF. I am just not finding the AF2 dismissal/starting from the end works for me. Plus I like writing my daily tasks in my task diary.</div>

<div class="content">Pondering the why, I am not sure is that helpful. Rather asking why I am not doing something, I find that the "how" is more illuminating. <br><br>Then again just getting better at dismissing without spending a lot mental of energy pondering  the why or how has been a good practice for me.<br><br>My reason is usually I think I want to do more than I do.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br><br>Welcome back!  Hope you had a great time away!<br><br>I love your analogy with "clutter".  AF2 has enabled me to see that there was a fair amount of clutter within my lists that was not clearing quickly enough.  With AF2 that red line just marches inexorably on - like pacman munching everything in it's path.  Move or be gone!!!!</div>
