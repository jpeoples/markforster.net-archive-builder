<div class="content">Hi all <br><br>Here is the following of my own serial about my organization and fist let me tell you what happened since I came back from my holidays (10 days ago). <br><br>I was suddently overwhelmed. Lot of buildings to sell, some clients lot of stuff I ought to do and a lot of people to see and it is just the beginning. Well I am ver happy about this, but this situation forced me to work harder in a short time and without paper :-((. Discussing with my clients let's me realize that I needed a big part of my document for my office became suddenly where I was i.e. anyway. <br><br>So I had 3 solution:<br>1.  taking all my paper files and my paper note book, <br>2. buying a new laptop (I dream about the macbook air) <br>3. or trying to tame the complicated iPad I just bought a few month ago but so complicated for a daily use. <br><br>I also realized that my computer was a real mess so I decided first to make a new organization thanks to some of you who gave us some link about the way to organize computer files. When this was done I was satisfied but I needed to sync some folders with my iPad and frankly I did not know really how to do it simply. <br><br>I tried goodreader but the result was bad. It was to messy and not the mirror of my computer file organization. Then I discovered Docs to go ( <a href="http://www.dataviz.com/products/documentstogo/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.dataviz.com/products/documentstogo/</a> ) and really it save me doing a perfect sync of my folders and files but obliged me to use MS word instead of page and .txt file. Anyway it is much better. <br><br>For my daily list and weekly / Monthly list (i.e. the summary of my projects) I decided to do it on a single file call weekly tasks and I mades another file with this time task paper with is like an autofocus list for my long terms project i.e. more than one month. The advantage of task paper for my long term list is to allow a real search on a word  which is very useful.<br><br>Now during the day I work with both list the weekly for anything which is less than one month, the long term list on tasks paper for anything else. I that each list as an AF double reading method. <br><br>Now I have my projects on to go, my list is divided to go and task paper and it is ok. IT is much better that with all this GTD software because as it is divided it is clear in my head too. <br><br>At night I make a review and a reporting and I prepare tomorrow's tasks and aims. <br><br>I hope this will help.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jupiter -I have been enjoying VooDooPad on the Mac and iPad.  It's a Wiki, so I make index pages for each month.  The developer's site (Flying Meat) says, "Drag and drop folders, PDFs, applications, or URLs into VoodooPad, and they will link up just like on the web. And with powerful search, nothing will be lost or out of reach."  <br><br>I also like to print files as pdf's to ACTPrinter on the iPad.  It is as easy as saving a pdf on the computer, but you can organise your documents into folders on the iPad.  <br><br>Do you plan on following up with this thread?  This is an important issue for me.<br><br>You commented above, "thanks to some of you who gave us some link about the way to organize computer files."  This is something I need to get into right away.</div>
