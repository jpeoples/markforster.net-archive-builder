<div class="content">I just did a bit of rewriting to get my home list set for SuperFocus, and surprise: I only have 40 things total, and some of that is repetitive. We will see in a couple weeks if that changes.</div>

<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>Hmm, I have "only" 80, and yes, most of them repetitive.  And yes, I have shifted to SuperFocus, too.  Man, Mark can be very persuasive in making us try out his new systems, ain't he? ^___^<br><br>Not that I'm complaining.<br><br>God bless!</div>

<div class="content">I am always astonished and envious at other people's task counts.  <br><br>I have 43 regularly recurring "work" tasks and 78 regularly recurring "personal" tasks = 121 regularly recurring tasks -- all some kind of "maintenance" work.  It includes stuff like "tidy desk", "check email", watering the trees, preparing for various meetings, and so on.  <br><br>It doesn't include ANY of my project work or miscellaneous tasks.  THOSE run consistently into several hundred individual tasks.  <br><br>Maybe it's the way I define my tasks, or maybe I'm just chronically over-committed.  Or maybe I just like doing lots of things.  :-)</div>

<div class="content">I currently have 40 in my Personal/Home list (!) and 15 in my Work list. <br><br>The bulk of the former are 'Action' tasks (one sitting stuff a la Gerry), but the latter has a bigger proportion of the next task (or pointer to the individual project list) of 'Results' associated with that for which I am paid to do.<br><br>@nuntym: yes, I have also succumbed, for the same reasons, settling into SAF a bit better after my instructions 'transgressions'!  BTW, no problem with the tone of that response to my attempt to bring more clarity to the transgression,<br><br>I liked your response to mary, was thinking of telling her I think the Ten Commandments are still a pretty concise and worthwhile set of instructions, pity many of them have fallen into disuse.</div>

<div class="content">At my project/work desk (GMT + 2): I meant to mention in my earlier posting above that not included in my SAF list, unless I decide otherwise for whatever reason, are the daily/weekly/monthly routine and maintenance stuff.  Some of these may be entered in Outlook as a reminder eg weekly full back-up, daily incremental back-up etc.<br><br>In an attempt to immerse myself into 'Results' mode for longer periods and to cut down on interruptions, I also have an Outlook reminder at 1100, 1300 and 1530 to check emails (I turn off automatic email retrieval and only send/receive at those times during the day - my Outlook 'signature' advises people that I may not have Internet access 24/7 and they must call/SMS me if urgent), return any calls, review SAF etc.</div>

<div class="content">I have currently 60 tasks on my list. Once thing I've noticed with SuperFocus is that the list expands much slower than it did with AF1. I think this is partly because the emphasis on finishing means that I am entering projects at a higher level than I was before, and partly that there is less temptation to find displacement activities because things can be got out of the way much quicker than before.</div>

<div class="content">So, do you put all the daily/weekly/monthly recurring tasks on your SAF list - or just have a list for each and put 'check daily list' or 'check weekly list' into SAF?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Alison,<br><br>I use separate lists which feed SAF.<br><br>They are triggered by Outlook, I then look at the 'sub' tasks and decide what to do next and do it or enter in SAF.<br><br>But sometimes I may put 'Check weekly list' in SAF and focus on those tasks, maybe adding the unfinished ones to the main SAF list if necessary.<br><br>Certainly, as Mark notes, the second column (page for me, RH)  seems to make a difference, early days still.</div>

<div class="content">Sorry - another question!<br><br>How about things like 'Check on feedback from X' when you don't know when this will come - it's a reminder really - but without a specific date. It's one of those things you don't want to forget, but you have no control on when the info will be available. One can only prod occasionally for a response!</div>

<div class="content">Allison.<br><br>Common response: Have a waiting-for list.<br><br>Me: I have project pages, one page per subject.  Each project is mentioned in my AF list.  If it's waiting for input, I will use that item as a reminder - daily or weekly I'll follow up.  If I get feedback early, I turn to the project page.</div>

<div class="content">Alison:<br><br><< How about things like 'Check on feedback from X' when you don't know when this will come - it's a reminder really - but without a specific date. >><br><br>You can put those on your list as normal tasks. I usually put a query after them, e.g. "X replied?" They serve as a reminder when you scan the list, and when the person replies you can cross the task off. If they haven't replied after a suitable interval, you can then chase them.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Mark - that sounds sensible - I'm probably getting obsessed with the detail!  I don't want to have too many external lists as this then starts to be the sort of more complex system that I usually fall down with - I get into procrastination mode and nothing gets done.  I find the simpler the better!</div>
