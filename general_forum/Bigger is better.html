<div class="content">Happy New Year!<br><br>A thought crossed my mind today, that I think makes following AF easier.  <br><br>Put big tasks on your list, rather than small ones.  Because AF only requires a little bit of work on a task to get credit, this takes a lot less planning.  If a task is too big and you are stuck, you may break it down.  But I think Clean House may work just fine instead of Clean Bathroom, Clean Kitchen, Clean Living Room, etc.  It keeps the list small.  Of course if you are neglecting the bathroom every time you Clean House (little and often), then it's necessary to specialize Clean House - Bathroom.<br><br>If I took this notion to the extreme, I might have a list that went:<br><br>Family Stuff<br>House Stuff<br>Work Stuff<br>Friends Stuff<br>Community Stuff<br>God Stuff<br>Health Stuff<br><br>And that would work just fine until specific things come up that are getting neglected.  So I put smaller things into the list.  Yet I think it's useful to keep the big ones around.<br><br>I can set goals and put those on the list.  If I know how to pursue the goal, it will get worked on.  Otherwise, it becomes backlogged and I know I need to plan the goal better, and put subgoals or tasks into the list.</div>

<div class="content">There have been other discussions on this forum about the 'right' level of granularity for expressing a task, some favouring the top level as you suggest Alan and others needing the specificity of the next action to help them overcome resistance and get started. I guess it depends on the person and the nature of the task. For some of my recurring but resisted tasks I have spent some time tweaking with the wording to sound do-able but to keep in focus the higher level purpose. I probably still haven't got the right balance since I'm writing this rather than actually doing the task!</div>

<div class="content">One of the reasons I like AF so much is because the notebook records EVERYTHING I have to do. Even highlighting, rather than crossing out/deleting dismissed tasks is helpful, because it ensures they're still legible when reviewed at a much later date. <br><br>Bigger tasks will need to be broken down to their constituent actions at some stage, so more lists (and on separate pieces of paper!) will be needed for all but the least complicated items.<br><br>LOVE that list :-))</div>

<div class="content">Bigger is better because:<br>SHORT) Your list is shorter<br>COMPLETE) All your duties are covered.<br>PROJECTS) Document your project plans elsewhere, and put the Project on your list.  Then to work on your project, just open up the plans and do something.  This is much more manageable than dumping your entire project onto the AF4 list.<br>OVERVIEW)  It's easier to get an overview, easier to make the "feels right" decision.<br><br>Bigger is worse when:<br>VAGUE) The task is too vague and you never act on it.<br>SCARY) The task is too intimidating and you never act on it.<br>NO DETAIL) There is a more specific task that you MUST act on, and the bigger task fails to remind you.  (This may come out of working on a project.)<br><br><br>In cases VAGUE and SCARY, this will become obvious when these tasks get stuck on your Closed list, and at that time you should flesh out the detail (and simultaneously realize that you are completely ignoring a big aspect of your life/work.)  So if big tasks don't get you working, THEN break out a smaller task.<br><br>Case NO DETAIL shouldn't be an issue, because whenever a specific duty comes up, you SHOULD put it on your list.  Whenever a Project has a MUST DO task, put it on the list.  These are exceptions to the Big Task philosophy.<br><br>One thing I do with my Task/Page implementation is put details within each Task/Page.  Only when details are needed though.  So the title is a Big task, and the rest of the page highlights details I need to follow.</div>

<div class="content">Alan,<br><br>FWIW, I have my life organized by Areas, much as you mentiioned as your extreem.  House, Financial, Personal Development, ... etc.<br><br>Then for each area I have a list of long term goals, then intermediate ones, then short terms ones.  Short term goals are usually about a month.<br><br>For the short term goals (especially if they are part of longer term goals) I have project sheets in my notebook or on my computer.  I will then usually just reference the project on the AF list, but sometimes I reference a task.  It all kind of depends ... on what, I don't know. <br><br>So, for example, I just have one "Clean House" task on there because I see cleaning house as a "level of effort" thing.  IOW, I don't have house cleaning goals, I just work for as long as necessary, or as long as I have time and it never ends.  However, I have a task to set up the new Wii system.  I could have it under "Organize Technology", but for some reason I wanted to focus on that one aspect.<br><br>Hey, it works ;-)</div>

<div class="content">p/s/<br>this read wrong. I feel guilty having someone else type my work when I'm able to peck decently when sufficiently motivated....Consider yourself "sufficient motivation" for typing that's done more like morse code!  ROTFL!  (((Happy New Year, friend!)))</div>

<div class="content">Wow Mike, you have your life ORGANIZED. I'm not the slightest where you are.  Does it work well for you?</div>

<div class="content">I think one of the reasons AF works is that you don't need all the organization that Mike uses for just stuff that needs to be done.  Projects are different and often need to be planned and organized.<br><br>But something like House Stuff is too big.  In reality, it could have so much stuff that the lack of detail leads it to be almost a useless item.  You would need a separate AF list for House Stuff that might include:<br><br>Change flood light bulb<br>Clean (to whatever level of detail you wanted)<br>Fix fence<br>Schedule furnace maintenance<br>Fix squeeky drawer<br>laundry<br>cook supper<br>shop<br>etc.<br><br>Some of those might only come to mind when you stumble on the problem again unless it is visible on a list.<br><br>I do agree that you shouldn't add detail that isn't needed, but you do need to recognize what level of detail you need.  Some of my tasks are very detailed just so I don't forget those important details.  But they really are single tasks (no multiple steps like a project) so it is fine by me.  Like Little B, I use the list to record almost everything.</div>

<div class="content">Personally, I just use a work and personal life notebook.  I simply view them as the hubs and things like project plans and other lists as the spokes.  This approach simplifies things greatly since for high level organizing and thinking I only worry about two "tools".  Project plans and detail can be elsewhere as long as I have one place to see everything it works out.  It is easy to then put in the main notebook review project plan for XYZ project and note where it is ie a file, notebook etc.  <br><br>Alan, I agree, my analogy is the grocery list.  You don't need to put all of the items you are buying into a "main" notebook, but you may write buy groceries, see list on refrigerator.<br><br>Gerry<br>www.simple-time-management.com</div>
