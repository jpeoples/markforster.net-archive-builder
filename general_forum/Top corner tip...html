<div class="content">Just a quick tip in honour of my Dad..<br><br>He used to tear a thumb nail sized semi circle off the top corner of used pages of a notebook so that he could find relevant pages fast.. you just grab the book by the top corners remaining pages and open it. <br><br>I use it in AF to open straight to the page where I'm adding items.. it really does save me bag loads of time flicking through trying to find the right page - you're writing almost as soon as you've thought of something..<br><br>Small tip thought it may be worth sharing with the world..</div>

<div class="content">You could also tear off the other corner when a page is "closed" and then find your way quickly to the first active page.</div>
