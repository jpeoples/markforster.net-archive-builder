<div class="content">Hi everybody! Thanks a lot for this amazing site!<br><br>I can sound silly but I feel this is really similar to don´t break the chain method because you control the same activity for a determinate time. The different is that you learn to work with many proyects at the same time.<br><br>In that way, you can use this method for create habits. Not only habits for everyday, also habits in a specific days like "study for TOELF" on tuesday and friday. You can combine the graphic with a monthly chart and have deadlines. <br><br>What do you think? It is very exaggerated?<br><br>P.D: Excuse my english...</div>

<div class="content">Hi Ana,<br>I too have been revisiting spinning plates. And yes it does help keep a connected flow to the projects which are "active" in your life at that time. <br>I feel like more discussion of this method would be helpful.</div>

<div class="content">I often use the Spinning Plates method on a day where there are one or two tasks that need to be done that day, and will take some time to complete. I can't face doing them all in one go, so alternating them with less challenging tasks is more fun.</div>
