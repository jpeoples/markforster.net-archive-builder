<div class="content">Hi all<br><br>Years and years ago I read do it tomorrow and I used to come to this site regularly. It’s been a long time since i was last here  and if I’m honest I’m feeling overwhelmed with the amount of Systems now available<br><br>Where should I start?  Is there a top 5 system list somewhere showing the most popular systems?<br><br>Thanks all</div>

<div class="content">Hello New guy,<br><br>you can divide Mark's systems in three broad categories:<br>- Long List systems (such as AF1, FVP, Simple Scanning etc)<br>- No List systems (5/2, No List FVP ect)<br>- more or less day-based systems (DIT, DWM, Dreams)<br><br>Most principles voiced in our discussions here relate to either one of these groups or all of them at the same time.<br><br>Where should you start? Well, what's your goal exactly?<br><br>Conversely, what challenges are you facing in your work and life at the moment?</div>

<div class="content">I might suggest starting with the very first Autofocus system, AF1, the one Mark is revisiting now (on the blog page). I find many of the systems are variations of this one system or at least use the same principles underlying it - for example, the balance between the rational and intuitive mind.</div>

<div class="content">New guy:<br><br>I agree with Paul. AF1 is the place to start. Apart from anything else, you will have the benefit of my current re-visiting of it (which is going very well btw).</div>

<div class="content">Hi guys<br><br>Thanks for all your comments.,  It's very much appreciated.  I am a chronic procrastinator and it's got a lot worse now that I am working at home.  I've tried so many different time management systemsand I've failed repeatedly at getting them to stick.  <br><br>The system that I stuck with the longest was GTD but in the end I felt it was controlling me and spent way too much time keeping the list up to date.  I've tried DIT and that  lasted 2 weeks before I abandoned that.  I've also tried AF1 but that didn't last long.  I can't really remember why I didn't like it.  <br><br>I think I get very overwhelmed if I have a long list.  I simply don't know where to start so I don't and I find busy work to do instead of proper work.  <br><br>I also remember that I used the Pomodoro Technique which I like a lot at the time.  I liked the ticking. I liked the fact that it helped me get started because it only required a short work period.  The problem with it was in a lot of cases I couldn't work on one thing for 25 minutes so I didn't get on with the rules.  <br><br>So I think I would like to try a time boxing system that is able to get me started.  I don't think I would do well with a long list as that would overwhelm me. <br><br>Is there anything that you guys would suggest?<br><br>Thank you</div>

<div class="content">If procrastination is your problem, I might suggest the randomizer method (<a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2014/1/22/random-time-management.html)." target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2014/1/22/random-time-management.html).</a> Follow the directions exactly and you'll get more work done than you ever have. But you sometimes have to jump out of the system to do tasks that have deadlines, but I try to resist doing that as long as I can. Otherwise, it's quite addictive.</div>

<div class="content">Yeah, the randomizer is an interesting system. It's good against procrastination, as Paul said. <br><br>Of course, there are many other options on this site... For instance, no-list systems are a different approach: <a href="../general_forum/Full List of Official No-List Systems.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2612782</a><br><br>Recently, I've come to like "The Simplest Form of No-List," which is just writing down the next thing you are going to do before doing it. I posted on this here: <a href="../general_forum/An underrated system.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2783160</a></div>

<div class="content">New Guy:<br><br>For time-boxing try my first book "Get Everything Done", which describes "time boxing" before the term was invented.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks guys for responding.  I've been reading a lot today about the various systems.  I've come to the conclusion that a long list system is not really what I'm looking for.  Although, I did think that Randomiser system was interesting.  <br><br>I was much more interested in no list systems and I think I'm going to try those out but add a timer to the mix and see where that gets me. <br> <br>If it's Ok with you guys I will come back and let you know how my time management journey goes.  <br><br>Once again thanks for pointing me in the right direction.</div>
