<div class="content">I saw this on Lifehacker tonight: <br><a href="http://lifehacker.com/5321204/take-18-minutes-to-keep-your-days-on-track" rel="nofollow">http://lifehacker.com/5321204/take-18-minutes-to-keep-your-days-on-track</a><br><br>In the past, a surge of hope and fantasy thinking a la "Now THIS is what I need to organize my day", would flood my consciousness and I'd be off implementing another system. <br><br>Yet tonight, I had none of the above. While there was some curiosity (Could this be helpful? Can it benefit AF?), I found my interest wane mid-way through the article. Alas, I never made it to the end. <br><br>I cannot remember a time where a productivity system fulfilled so many of my needs. It would appear I need to take up some new hobbies.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Avrum,<br><br>First of all, I usually avoid sites like that.  There is seldom any useful information in them and almost never anything new.  It seems that people love to re-publish things others have written, to get themselves exposure.  This results in the same stuff appearing over and over.  A real time waster.<br><br>As to the specific advice, that has been the core of my system forever, and continues to be.  AF is what I use when I have free time that is not scheduled.  The important stuff is scheduled or it will not get done.  I usually plan tomorrows work at the end of the day and then just review my plan, in the morning, making a minor change or two if necessary.  I don't review every hour, but I did pick up the advice: "Ask Lakien's question" from his book.  The question, at every break or task switch is: "What is the best use of my time -- right now?"  That takes less than a minute ;-)</div>

<div class="content">I have to say that when I saw that title I wondered whether you were referring to procrastination ;-) <br><br>Lucy</div>

<div class="content">Too true Avrum, I decluttered 90% of my self help (including time management) books after a few months of AF.  I kept thinking that because I wasn't *doing* what I knew was important it was because I didn't have my goals right or I needed to get over some psychological issues (although I didn't know what they could be).  <br><br>All I had to do was: <br>- reduce some resistance to unpleasant tasks <br>- work on the tendency to set unrealistic standards for what was possible to achieve given the fact that my life is pretty full and I don't want to be a working machine<br>- figure out how not to get overwhelmed <br><br>AF1 either resolved this in the case of resistance or revealed it and then resolved it.  <br><br>That's why tweaks don't really interest me, nor does AF2 so much - my tweaking is done in how the tasks are phrased and what goes on the list (and I wouldn't have to do that if I didn't have a whole house to renovate in my spare time).<br></div>

<div class="content">I love Lifehacker and get lots out of it--it's one of my main sites.  I saw that item yesterday too and didn't get all the way through it.  I agree with Avrum, I didn't get that same rush as I once did.  I guess because AF2 is working pretty well.  Not that I'm not still procrastinating, though.</div>

<div class="content">Balfour, I agree. Lifehacker often has great articles, one of which was AF. <br><br>With respect to procrastinating... ditto.</div>

<div class="content">Gee, I don't even read my RSS feeds from David Allen (GTD) anymore - there's 95 items in there right now.  Of course, a lot of them are to sell something.</div>

<div class="content">I don't read RSS feeds anymore at all, everything comes in through email (sometimes with the help of <a href="http://www.shootthebreeze.net/blogalert/index.php)." rel="nofollow">http://www.shootthebreeze.net/blogalert/index.php).</a> Makes it a lot easier to notice when I'm trying to follow too much feeds, because my inbox will overflow :-)</div>

<div class="content">It's uncanny how AF + the lovely, talented people on this forum have made obsolete the many blogs, books and magazines I once used for motivation and productivity.</div>
