<div class="content">Although I am not yet proficient with Autofocus I must say I've been delighted with it as a way to clear my email inbox. I've always left way too many emails in my inbox as "prompters" in the past. With Autofocus I've begun a practice of looking at that days emails and culling tasks for my AF list. Once I have pulled out all the tasks, then I just slide the rest over to a folder labelled "Processed" (ala Total Workday Control). I can now search those in the event that I need to refer to info on emails later, but I can have a clean inbox at the end of every day. That is huge to me since I receive so many emails each day.<br><br>Still need to refine the process of finding the pertinent emails. Considering using an @ sign with a date to point me to the email. <br><br>I also take notes all day in calls with clients, so I put the AF list in the back and my notes in the front and when the two meet I'll start a new notebook. I use a date in parenthesis after a task to point me to the notes that prompted that task.<br><br>Pretty good stuff!</div>

<div class="content">Hi, I'm just bumping this up to get some additional input - I was wondering if anyone else had any tips for email in the AF system.  This was all I could find using the search.  Unlike Mark in TX, I file in folders, not in one big "processed" folder.  But I like his idea of putting the date of the email in the AF task list.  At least you can search by date received that way.  <br><br>Where I now work, I find people don't put a very good header on their email, which makes things difficult to find and a date received would help.  <br><br>There's also a huge number of "thanks for your help" type of emails, which drives me crazy - I'm not being rude, but it sort of wastes time - mine reading it and theirs writing it (not that I don't think it probably makes the workplace a nicer place).  <br><br>I've kept an empty in-box for the past number of years and it's been a great thing.  Before AF, if something was in my in-box, it was an action item, but I'd like to just have it completely empty every night and contain my list in my AF notebook.<br></div>

<div class="content">I have a single huge archive folder for all mails, but I also have two folders that temporarily hold mails - "follow up" and "wait". I think I read about that setup on lifehacker. <br><br>So when I process my inbox, I move every mail in one of these folders, leaving the inbox empty. If I pull a task I have to do from an mail, it goes into the "follow up" folder and I mark the task on my af list with "(f)". If a mail stands for something I'm waiting for, I put it in the "wait" folder and put a reminder on my af list, marked with (w). All other mails go straight to archive. Once I do the task from my af list, I know where the mail is and can put it into archive after I'm done.  <br><br>You probably could do the same with several reference/project folders instead of one archive.</div>

<div class="content">Since starting AF I've changed my email management quite considerably but the main tips I would give for managing email in AF is <br><br>(1) use an AF task to "check email".  I find that I clear email quicker and more effectively if done from my list than on an ad hoc basis.  I have that task at least once on every page. <br><br>(2) Set up a folder called Autofocus.  Any emails which I do not action immediately go into that folder and are entered as a task on my list, suffixed by AFe so that I can spot them easily on a scan of my pages.  Sometimes I add the date of the email if it seems necessary. <br><br>(3) If a backlog of email builds up I have 5 folders called Page 1, Page 2 ..... to Page 5.  I split my backlog emails amongst those files and action them like AF lists at the same time as dealing with my current email.  Keeping my inbox clear has a significant psychological effect.  Having 5 pages (folders) with 14 emails in each has much less resistance for me than an inbox with 70 items in it.</div>

<div class="content">I started using the D-A-F-T technique I read about here:  <a href="http://www.legaltypist.com/D-A-F-T" rel="nofollow">http://www.legaltypist.com/D-A-F-T</a><br><br>I have recurring items in AF to  Check email, Review ..Defer folder, and File email.  I also have a recurring task to DAFT inbox in an attempt to clear out the old junk.  Any email I move to the .Act folder also gets its own task in AF with [.Act] noted in the margin so I will know both where to find details and will know to move the email out of the .Act folder. <br><br>I haven't been doing this long, but it seems to help.  It also helps me not to hesitate in getting rid of emails that I would otherwise just not delete.  This way I have to make a conscious decision to defer, act, or file something.  I no longer accept the option of leaving it in my Inbox.   (I have hundreds of MB worth of emails most of which I probably don't need.)  I usually scan the .Trash folder as a final check before deleting.  If I find it stacking up there, I will add a recurring task to AF to empty the .Trash folder.</div>

<div class="content">As I've said on many occasions I use an Outlook add-on called the Nelson Email Organiser (NEO), which automatically sorts mail into virtual folders. It is absolutely ideal for use with AF. You can read about it at <a href="http://www.caelo.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.caelo.com/</a><br><br>They have a 90 day free trial.</div>

<div class="content">My new work has an email system called Thunderbird.  I wish I had my Outlook back.  :-( <br>I have used Mark's technique of "declare a backlog" for my email inbox and that's how I originally got to the state of a clear inbox several years ago (thanks Mark!).  I did find that I never actually went back into that Backlog folder even once - how sad is that?   <br><br>In theory, I like the idea of having an Autofocus folder, but it seems like that's like my former practice of leaving the task in my inbox, only I'd have to move it twice - once to that folder, and again when I finished and moved it to the proper location.  I could do that before because my former job was a lot less email intensive - maybe 5 a day that required action.  If an email was in there and was a read item, it needed action but I didn't write the action required onto a list.  <br>I currently file emails right away in their correct location and flag them with a "to do" flag.  It makes it easy to find them and all their related items and I can search by the to do flag easily.  I could put the folder name on my Autofocus list along with the task.</div>

<div class="content">There is a free version of Taglocity here:<br><br><a href="http://www.taglocity.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.taglocity.com/</a><br><br>I use it extensively now.  It flags mail according to rules and will even send the tags along with the email if you want to collaborate with another person using Taglocity.<br><br>The downside is that I think it is only for Outlook.  But there may be other free products out there which do substantially the same thing and might work with Thunderbird.</div>

<div class="content">I'm a visual/kinesthetic learner and while I understand and use tags and search functions extensively for many purposes, for my email I am still most comfortable having project-based folders for the classes I'm teaching, the committees I'm on, and the various research/creative projects I'm involved in. The folder system means that when I do need to refer back to earlier emails, searches will be quick, easy and productive.<br><br>I check my email morning, noon and evening and make sure my email box is empty each 24 hours. Empty means that  each message has been replied to if necessary, calendared if further action is necessary, deleted or filed.<br><br>I'm on a Mac and use Mail. I make extensive use of Mail's Rules for processing my email. These rules can be as complex and as flexible as I choose and can file messages based on sender, recipient, subject, etc.<br><br>Using these rules, most of my incoming mail is routed automatically into the appropriate folder. When I check my inbox, I also  easily scan my folders as well as my inbox to see if there is a new message from my chair or a student or from a project colleague because that folder will have an "unread" icon beside it (with the number of unread messages.} This also makes waiting for a response on a project easier.<br><br>Messages that don't need replies, such as receipts and newsletters are appropriately filed, automatically marked "read," processed when I have time and don't cry out for my unncessary attention.<br><br>If an emaiI requires further action on my part, I reply to it with a date I'll respond further ("I'll have a draft to you by Thursday") and put it on my AutoFocus list. If an email is setting up a meeting or setting a hard deadline, I  calendar the event in iCal directly from my email.  My iCal syncs between my laptop and my iPhone automatically via MobileMe which means that I always have my calendar with me and it's always up to date.<br><br>As a side note, some of my colleagues are just flakes when it comes to email. I don't want to be one of them.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Mike, I'll check out taglocity.<br><br>P.S. Is that pronounced Taglo City or to rhyme with velocity?</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>I don't know for sure but I'd guess it is a made up word to sound  as if it were to real words, i.e. "tag" and "velocity" with the emphasis on the second part.  "tagLOCity", I suppose.<br><br>The one really big change for me was to move everything into one big archive folder.  Initially incoming mail is tagged and filtered to appropriate folders.  I want to quickly see that my wife sent me a message and not have that get lost ;-)<br><br>Once I answer, I move both the original and answer to my "archive" folder and use the excellent search features of taglocity to find it by tag, words in the subject, date, words in the text ... all the usual suspects.<br><br>So now I have only unprocessed email in all but my "archive" folder.  And, of course, the ability to add many tags allows the mail to be "filed"  in multiple ways, as it were.</div>

<div class="content">When emails come in that need an action, I put it on my list & then use the flag reminder (Outlook) to remind me the day it's due and move the original email to a pending folder.  When the reminder pops up with the email, I then make sure I've finished whatever action is due and then either delete the original email or move the item to an archive folder that is automatically archived.  Most emails can be deleted or printed for a client's file and then deleted.<br><br>One thing that has really helped me in finding old emails is windows desktop search.  I just type a few words that I know are in the email or document and it brings up a list of related items.  I tried using the Google desktop search, but had issues with it on my work computer.</div>
