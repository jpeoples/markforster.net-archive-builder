<div class="content">I would be most obliged if some of the readers of this forum would share a couple statistics from their AutoFocus (version 1 or 2) lists.  They are:<br><br>1. How many open pages do you have?<br><br>2. What time frame do you intend your list to be aimed at?<br><br>I think the first question is pretty straight-forward.  Feel free to add additional detail if you want, like what your typical number of open pages is and how many lines you have per page.  But just a simple number is fine.<br><br>For the second I just mean your intuitive sense of the time frame during which you hope to process most, or even all, of the items on your list.  Some people like to have a to-do list that is just focused on the next few days.  Others might have one aimed at a period of months.<br><br>My answers:<br><br>List 1, professional: 4 open pages, 33 items/page; about two weeks.<br><br>List 2, personal: 12 open pages, 33 items/page; about two months.<br><br>Thanks!</div>

<div class="content">51 active pages, 45 items per page, personal and work combined.  I typically have 800-1200 active tasks.  Don't ask.  :-)<br><br>2/2/09 - Started this list with AF1<br>6/27/09 - Switched to AF1/AF2 dual method (kept using same list)<br>7/7/09 - Switched to "pure" AF2 (kept using same list)<br><br>Time frame -- If a task must wait till a future date to start, it goes in my tickler file (Outlook for work, 43 folders for personal).  If it's something that I could do now but don't want to think about, it goes into the tickler.  Otherwise it goes on the list.</div>

<div class="content">Personal, using AF condensed and AF1:  currently 16 active pages, 25 items/page; 2 weeks time frame (this is current average time it takes to close a page). <br>Current open items:  122 <br>Pages and open items are higher than average due to a summer projects dump and being away on holidays - generally at half this.</div>

<div class="content">I should add that in 6 months of doing AF, I have closed ~ 84 pages, so about 14 pages per month.  The shortest time to close a page has been 3 days.  The speed of closing increased fairly recently because more of my time at home is spent working on the list.  In the old days I had an average closing time of just over a month and would put in things I wanted to have finished in the next month.  <br><br>In the beginning, I also had a few periods where I would totally avoid the list until I learned to let go and dismiss according to the rules as well as how to better write tasks down so I would actually do them.  I think my longest closing time on a page was somewhere around 60 days because of this.</div>

<div class="content">Currently I have a combined work/personal list with 6 full pages @ 30 items per page and 1 partial page active.  Those pages are 82% complete.  I don't really have a time frame in mind when I put things on the list but tasks that aren't realistically going to get done in the next 2 weeks or so tend to get shunted to my calendar as reminders pretty quickly.<br><br>In my book I also have 81 pages that are either closed or dismissed.   I've been working AF since mid-February.</div>

<div class="content">I have one single AF2 list started 17 days ago.<br><br>798 items<br>76 active items (9.5%)<br>11 dismissed items (1.4%)<br><br>As I've been only using AF2, I have never considered the page as a unit, but anyway I have 18 closed pages and 20 active.<br><br>As others, I use a tickler and a calendar for scheduled items.<br>The page that has lived longer for the moment was active for 15 days, and it was closed for a dismissal. I don't feel the need for a time frame, and I feel comfortable dismissing items according to the rule.<br></div>

<div class="content">I can't imagine having so few items either - although I am adding less with AF2 than with AF1 curiously.<br><br>I currently have 59 active pages (38 lines per page) and 272 active items.  I don't have a time scale for completion but would like to get it down to about 1 month.  My oldest items are currently nearly 5 months old. ooo-er!</div>

<div class="content">Work list:  21 active pages, 29 lines per page, 134 active tasks<br>Home list: 5 active pages, 29 lines per page, 79 active tasks<br><br>Anything that can't be done when I write it down goes on the calendar.  I'm much more effective with my work list than my home list; having a toddler means there's little time (or energy) to get things done at home.</div>

<div class="content">re. my short list - I'm not teaching currently so the only "work" tasks that are going on there are 2 research projects & the syllabus I'm planning for fall... I tend to have MANY more active pages during the school year.  I also have vacation coming up in 10 days or so, so more stuff is getting dumped to the calendar than usual - if I know I'm not going to get to something before I leave, it's going to the calendar rather than the AF list.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-07-16 19:20</div>
<div class="content">In my case the number of active items can easily increase during certain days, and drop down when they want focus, either because I do them, or because I schedule them. Few days ago I had more than 150 items, today about half.<br><br>I'm going to use my single AF list also during my next vacation period. I want to see what the effect is of dismissing all those work items that I'm not able to address before. And of course somewhere in the list there is a "review dismissed items" item, that never got focus up to now, and that maybe will get focus only when it will be on notice for dismissal.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim - maybe our task & page #'s stay down because of the focus on only putting on the list things that we are actually planning to do in the near future.  Hence the very good question "what time frame do you intend your list to be aimed at?"  That was one of the most important filtering questions I asked myself a number of months ago.  Dismissal got pretty easy after that.  If I would have left them on and kept on putting everything I ever want to do on the list, I would have been way too overwhelmed and probably would have quit in frustration.  <br><br>You and Christine don't / didn't seem to have or need that focus on time frame - different strokes.  Glad to see that Christine's appears to slowly be coming over to the dark side...  :-)<br></div>

<div class="content">Work list:<br>Just started page 5 (only 1 item on that page).  Total active items:  58.  No real time frame to finish, except some things at the end need to get done real soon.  <br><br>Some of the items are recurring.  Some have subcomponents within them and are like mini (very mini)-projects, but it makes sense to group them into one.  On a few, I'm waiting on the actions of others.  <br><br>Also, I bc myself on emails for which I'm waiting for a response or an action and put that bc into a waiting file within my email program.  I have a recurring note on my list to check the email waiting file.<br><br>My home list is pretty similar, but I'm not home right now, so I don't know how many pages/items are on that list.  If you put the two lists together, there could be a hundred items between them, but I don't think so.</div>

<div class="content">Mixed personal and work list, continued from my AF-1 list, working in AF-2 manner since the end of June. Right now I have 30 active pages, 29 tasks per page, with a total 149 tasks. My first active page is exactly 2 months old. That timeframe is a bit longer than I'm comfortable with, but it's decreasing, two weeks ago it was 3 months.<br><br>What I'm very happy about is that since starting AF2 my list is finally decreasing in length, instead of increasing; two weeks ago I had over 200 active tasks. My guess is that I'll end up with something between 100 and 150 active tasks on the list.<br><br>I do note that my home tasks are moving slower than my work tasks. I might go back to writing work tasks from the top of the page and home tasks from the bottom, but right now mixing them works fine.</div>

<div class="content">I had to come home and report on my home list:<br>8 active pages<br>87 active items!  <br><br>More items than I thought.  But, I don't work on this list all the time, as I do at work.  Also, I just started applying AF2 rules to this list (my AF1 list, which I'm not planning to create a new list out of.)  Also, there's quite a few bogus items on it, like "shut the computer."  And recurring tasks.  As I looked through the list, I found a couple of duplicates and deep-sixed a few others, so it was a useful exercise.  And, of course, there's something compelling about getting stuff done and crossing them off your list and after going through the list, I see a lot of ripe items on it.</div>

<div class="content">I have an office list (stuff I can't do anywhere else) and an the main list where I put everything else (including work stuff I can do at home) - this helps me focusing on the office stuff during the day. For both lists, I use A7 index cards with about 25 lines (some items need two lines).<br><br>Main list: 9 active pages, 62 active items<br>Office list: 6 active pages, 26 active items<br><br>I created a new main list for AF2, for the office list I reused the AF1 list (only some weeks old).<br><br>Time frame: none - I enter whatever I want or have to do. Up to now, that works well - everything that should go to someday/maybe according to GTD ends up being dismissed - I prefer not to have to decide on which list an item has to go.</div>

<div class="content">Personal list: 5 open pages (oldest one started on 11th March), 32 items per page, 33 unactioned items overall.<br><br>However, I have to add that I've been using the AF list as a capture list for non-urgent items only, while using "old-fashioned" daily task lists for everything else... So, the AF list has almost become my "someday maybe" list, though I do refer to it to pick out items to do at weekends or on slack days... I haven't started using AF2 yet.<br><br>I don't have a time frame, but I try to have "purge days" every now and then, where I make a point of trying to get rid of everything on the oldest page (either by dismissing or doing it) - it gives me an enourmous sense of satisfaction. I actually pysically get rid of each page once all the items on it are done, so I can't say how many pages I've completed since January.<br><br>Secondly, I have a separate list for fee-earning work (for one particular ongoing project I'm involved in). Here I usually have just 2 active pages, currently 16 unactioned items, which I'm planning/hoping to get through over the course of next week...<br><br>Best wishes<br>Betti<br></div>

I could easily take out all the "someday/maybe" kinds of items and put them in a tickler or somewhere else (and sometimes do).   But that accounts for less than 10% of my open tasks.  Probably 50% of the tasks on my list get actioned within 2-3 days, another 30% of the tasks on my list do get actioned within a week or two, and another 10% within a month.<br><br>I guess I just have too much to do.

<div class="content">My home list isn't too successful, but my work list seems to work well for me.<br><br>15-17 pages; 140-165 tasks.  The list seems pretty stable at this level.  I add a couple of pages (32 lines per page) a week and usually close about the same number.<br><br>It worked OK with AF1 and I just changed the way to process it with AF2.  I am a little sloppy about returning to the end of the list once I work on something, but other than that, no tweaks.  This usually happens when I know there is something earlier I want or need to do (it "stood out" on the morning review) and the day is getting short.  I keep heading toward it doing things that "stand out" on the way.  If nothing specific is really dragging me back, I usually start at the end per the instructions.<br><br>I did notice something today that I thought was odd.  I've started looking at the middle of each page and then down and up.  ChristineB mentioned the same thing a couple of days ago: <br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/835292#post836105" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/835292#post836105</a><br><br>I can't image what it will be like if the list gets too much longer.  Going through 17 pages is a bit of a chore, both first thing in the morning (forward) and every time I start to look for a task to "stand out" (going backwards).</div>

<div class="content">Hi Marty<br><br>I found the down and up review lasted for a few days and then morphed into "true" AF2 mode.  Really weird - as if my subconscious needed time to convince my brain it was ok to work backwards and bottom to top!<br><br>I am now down to 202 tasks but closed off 4 pages yesterday.  I still have 56 open pages (I know - nightmare!) but the majority have only 1 or two items and I suspect that my list may well settle down to a similar level to yours.  There are very few tasks in my list now carrying a major resistance which makes it so much easier - my only hurdle is feeling well enough to work on it for as long as I want but the fact that I have made so much progress with such limited time is a real testament to the benefits of Mark's system.  Thanks Mark!!</div>

AF1 helped me a lot and AF2 is even better.<br><br>Part of my problem going through my list is that my tasks are sometimes quite detailed.  They always fit on one line, but often use that full line.  Others of course are short; especially recurring tasks.</div>
