<div class="content">Nearly all TM system by Mark have a dismissal feature.<br>How to manage them?<br><br>Here I think I should do this way:<br><br>The first time I review dismissed tasks, whenever it is, either cancel it or input to the dismissed task management system.<br><br>Task -> (title, last visit time, visited times)<br><br>I sort it by 'visited times'(less first) first, then 'last visit time'(early first).<br>Every time, show top N(=10, I think) dismissed task, re-enter to my list or achieve with tags.<br>Remove those processed tasks. And get next N dismissed tasks(if there's any).<br>When you finished reviewing, update 'last visit time' and 'visited times' of visited tasks.<br><br>It should use some digital tools to implement it, or I will implement by myself.<br><br>I don't think we need to review dismissed tasks anywhere. So I can just review them on my PC and take my paper notebook to process the active tasks.<br><br>Do you want this tool too?</div>

<div class="content">It seems too complex compared to what it achieves. In fact I think a simple bookmark achieves the same result as this proposal.</div>

<div class="content">I agree with Alan.  Don't add too much complexity.</div>

<div class="content">+JMJ+<br><br>I concur with Alan. Too much headroom also, I have to type them to the PC, separate from my notebook? And besides, leaving them where they are in my AF notebook is a good index of how long I have let those dismissed tasks linger.<br><br>God bless.</div>

<div class="content"><< Too much headroom also, I have to type them to the PC, separate from my notebook? >><br><br>Not if you're already doing Superfocus digitally. On my Checkvist list, upon dismissal I move those tasks to a dismiss page. Upon review of dismiss page some tasks just get deleted (cleared from mind), reentered or moved to hibernate in someday page, that's only very occasionally reviewed. A bit less overhead than what IL proposes though.</div>

<div class="content">Hi,<br><br>You just copy the dismissed tasks to the system.<br>Review as many as you want (like twitter, start from the latest, but you don't need to browse all tweets).<br>Achieve or delete some of them if you want.<br><br>Nothing more.<br><br>The system do sorting and other things for you. (It's a program)<br><br>Can we do less?</div>

<div class="content">+JMJ+<br><br><<Can we do less? >><br><br>Yes.  Leave the dismissed tasks in your notebook where you originally dismissed them.  How far back in your notebook your dismissed tasks are is a good indication of how long you have left them linger in your system.<br><br>And, *argh* headroom? Man I am so embarrassed *blush*<br><br>God bless.</div>
