<div class="content">Anybody noticed google lately? They never seen happy enough with their search engine regardless that they are by far dominate the market. It used to be that we got 10 webpages to look at, and now we're seeing video results, news results, even real time social media messages (twitter anyone), all on the same page.<br><br>I guess Google has what Timemanagementsystemitis. The oft criticized urge to tweak our time management methods. The search pages are more complex, but they're still striving for simplicity (notice how they now hide various elements on their frontpage on page load!). I'd say its as good example of the value of persisting to find something that works better.</div>

<div class="content">True but.  Google started with a good search engine, then tweaked it.  No amount of tweaking to a bad search engine will turn it into a good one.<br><br>You must start with something good, and if you don't have that, it's time for big changes, not tweaks.</div>
