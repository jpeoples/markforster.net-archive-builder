<div class="content">How do you guys do projects in AF4R, assuming you do projects in a similar way to Alan: <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1319077" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1319077</a><br><br>Do you put "Work on project X" in the Unfinished section and then single tasks of a project in Old/New? Or everything on project X in Unfinished until the whole project is finished?<br><br>Thanks,<br>Tijl</div>

<div class="content">But what about projects taking months? Having those in your Unfinished section aren't exactly encouraging... So maybe something like this?<br><br>Project or task length > 3 days (3 days of 8 hours): Add to Recurring, split into tasks < 7 days<br>Project or task length > 1 hour, < 3 days: Add to Unfinished, split into tasks < 1 hour<br>Project or task length < 1 hour: Add to Old/New<br><br>Anyway, I don't know... I've not been very consistent in my approach to projects in general or for AF4R specifically.<br><br>How do you do it?</div>

<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>Happy Holidays, Tijl Kindt!<br><br>Well it depends on what you define as "unfinished."  I use something similar to AF4R, which differentiates new/old, recurrent, and unfinished tasks.<br><br>Now please note I said "TASKS."  Projects are, by definition, a collection of tasks towards a certain goal, and this definition guides me on how to treat my projects.<br><br>If I am going to make a new project, I make a new file and enter the name into the AF list as "New."<br><br>If I have worked a project  >>to the completion of one or more of its tasks BUT NOT to the completion of the project itself,<< I re-enter the project name into the AF list as "Recurrent."<br><br>If I worked on a project >>but did not finish the current task in that project,<< I re-enter the name of the project AND the task that was not finished into the AF list as "Unfinished."<br><br>If I finished >>the project itself<< I delete it from my AF list.<br><br>Do these all make sense?<br><br>God bless!</div>

<div class="content">Okay so basically, I could follow this guide:<br><br>1) New project? Add to Old/New<br>2) Length > 2 hours? Split into subtasks in a project page outside AF<br>3) Add first subtask to Old/New<br>4) Ready to work on the project? Work on the current subtask listed in Old/New or Unfinished<br>5a) Finished subtask, but not the project? Re-enter project in Recurring and add next subtask to Old/New<br>5b) Subtask not finished? Re-enter project in Recurring and re-enter subtask in Unfinished<br>5c) Project finished? Great!<br>6) Go back to 3)<br><br>Does that sound a bit like what you're doing?</div>

<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>Well, I do not put subtasks into my AF but remain in the project files UNLESS they are unfinished.  This is because (1) I do not want to hunt for subtasks in my AF (2) I try to minimize rewriting, they cost time, and (3) what would the use of the project files be if I put my subtasks in the AF list? ^___^   And if I finished the project I'd go to step 1, since there are no more subtasks to add.  But basically yeah ^___^<br><br>God bless!</div>

<div class="content">One disadvantage that I see in this is that you have two entries referring to your project in your AF list. One for the project itself in Recurring and one for the next task. So when you get to the project in Recurring you have to figure out where your next task was... in Unfinished or Old/New. I'm guessing you skip step 3 in my guide?</div>

<div class="content">**nods** I didn't see your reply until after I posted mine, but that pretty much confirms it.<br><br>So this would be the roadmap then, I guess:<br>1) New project? Add to Old/New<br>2) Length > 2 hours? Split into subtasks in a project page outside AF<br>3) Ready to work on the project? Work on the next subtask or on the current subtask in Unfinished<br>4a) Finished subtask, but not the project? Re-enter project in Recurring. Go back to 3).<br>4b) Subtask not finished? (Re-)enter project in Recurring and (re-)enter subtask in Unfinished. Go back to 3)<br>4c) Project finished? Great! Go back to 1)<br><br>Thanks so much for your input :).</div>

<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>Well, if a project's subtask is in the Unfinished column I do not need to re-enter the project name in the Recurring column to remind me of the project later ^___^<br><br>God bless!</div>

<div class="content">Tijl Kindt  asked ...<br><< Do you put "Work on project X" in the Unfinished section and then single tasks of a project in Old/New? Or everything on project X in Unfinished until the whole project is finished? >><br><br>I tend to combine project/subtask as one task in DWM. I believe you can do the same in AF4R. <br><br>So I have tasks in the form "Work on project X (one or two next actions)".  When I remember a new next actions for project X, I either add a new subtask in Project X reference check list or just add into DWM list a taks in the form "Do one next action for project X". When the latter stand out, I either do it immediately or consolidate that subtask into project X check list.<br><br>I also have a task in DWM to "Review projects", where I'll review my projects list and make sure there's at least one task in DWM for each active project.<br><br>If I didn't finish a task "as written", I'll Re-enter (1W ahead) incomplete task (AF4R = unfinished). If I did finish it, I'll Enter (1M ahead) a new task (AF4R = old/new) for that Project X with relevant next action.<br><br>AF/DWM is so very flexible in defining task size, that I think we should really exploit it. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">I have a separate PROJECT section just before the RECURRING section which is treated like the latter. This has the advantage of having an overview of all active projects. Once I have worked on a project (completed at least one task from the separate project list) the project's name is check-marked and rewritten at the end of the PROJECT section. Since I write entry dates on the right hand side of the pages I can see if a project is idle for too long.</div>
