<div class="content">For those, who use some elements of GTD, but also for everybody who is interested in others' TM and productivity systems. This post bellow is old, however I found it today. Very interesting ideas, especially in how it deals with those GTD rules/features which are its main weaknesses (and these are also described there). Can be good inspiration, although pretty far from AF.<br><br><a href="http://www.whatsbestnext.com/2010/08/getting-things-done-to-the-next-level/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.whatsbestnext.com/2010/08/getting-things-done-to-the-next-level/</a></div>

<div class="content">Much of this seems sensible, though it was spoilt for me when he professes ignorance of the "A-Z Filing System" which is a core part of GTD. From what he says, this is so alien to his idea of good filing that it probably just didn't take when he read it. (A-Z filing is just optimising your filing by ease of filing rather than ease of recovery. The insight is that even if you do occasionally need to look under 2 or 3 headings for a document, this is still going to be more efficient than a theoretically perfect system which you don't always follow.)<br><br>As you say, some way from AF, but it does go some way towards some of the stuff that AF doesn't claim to cover.</div>

<div class="content">For filing domestic stuff I just do it periodically in date order under a few simple categories.<br><br>Filing in date order is easy as it files mostly in the order it comes in, just split it into a pile for each category.<br><br>(I don't even bother with files as such, just put it into A4 plastic wallets, write on the date range and category, then put the wallets in a box.)</div>

<div class="content">@WILL: I understood proposed filling system as splitted to several main categories (general, actual projects, company operations (finance, accounting) etc) and then still filling A-Z in each of them. Which is something I always used. E.g. I never had my current project files at the same filling system as my general/archive stuff etc. <br><br>But what is most important for me: when I fill a document or generally when I put any physical thing somewhere, I ask the question: "Where will I probably tend to look for it when I need it? What will be my first idea?" It works perfectly for me. And usualy when I cannot find something quickly, it is because I broke this rule. The system order itself (being A-Z, or more broad categories or even different places) is not so important as asking this question for me. Including home stuff etc. <br><br>@SMILEYPETE: I use system similar to yours, e.g. for receipts, ATM receipts and similar, which I do not bother to categorise - I take it out of my wallet, pin it together with date (e.g. "jan-feb 2011") and in case  I would need any, I approximatelly know where to look for. After some time, I trash them.</div>

<div class="content">"Where will I look for it", "How often will I need to find it" and "How long does it take to file" get equal attention overall, but they get different priorities. Something I need rarely but would need to find quickly (legal papers) get "Where look". Routine papers get "how often" and "time to file".</div>
