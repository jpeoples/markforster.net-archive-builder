<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-07-29 17:22</div>
<div class="content">Hi everyone,<br><br>after my German translation of AF2 at <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/825490" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/825490</a> I decided to translate the revised instructions as well. This time I published them to the wiki instead of the forum. I figured this would make it easier for other people to correct mistakes I made and perhaps discuss about what the best translations for certain terms are. Also, if you want to translate Autofocus into another language and don't have a blog to publish it yourself, feel free to post it into the wiki. It's not really been getting any love lately.<br><br>The German Translation can be found here: <a href="http://wiki.autofocus.cc/German_Translation" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.autofocus.cc/German_Translation</a></div>

<div class="content">Thanks Mark, but the link there is not working for me. It seems to link right back to the English instructions.</div>

<div class="content">Hello Andreas,<br><br>First of all: great translation. Thank you very much for you work.<br><br>i missed your post here but found Marks link to your translation. I already started to change some words and formulations, without getting permission from you first. I want to excuse my behavior. That was very rude. You luckily have choosen  a wiki with a history function, so you can restore my edits if you like.<br><br>By the way, which is the best way to discuss certain terms in your wiki? Or should we do that here?</div>

<div class="content">Not at all, Steffen. It's a wiki, it's designed to be changed by anyone. Your input is very welcome!</div>

<div class="content">Re discussion: Well, I'll always check both the wiki discussion page and the forum. In the long term the wiki is probably the better place, so we don't clutter this forum  and let this thread sink to the bottom after a while.</div>

<div class="content">Hello Andreas,<br>following your suggestion I "felt free" to post an Italian translation of the revised instructions on the wiki.<br><br>Mark, once again thank you for sharing this amazing system.<br><br>Romano</div>

<div class="content">jf:<br><br>Thank you very much!<br><br>I'll sent Mark a message, in case he doesn't follow this thread anymore. Since the title just says "German translation", it's possible. I think I'll start a new thread, "Call for translations".</div>

<div class="content">If someone would give me the link for Romano's Italian translation I will put on the instructions.</div>
