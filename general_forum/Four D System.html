<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2012-01-7 0:15</div>
<div class="content">Yesterday, based on Mark's prodding us to try to simplify AF1, I "invented" a new system as a joke.  But then as I thought about it, it seemed like it might actually work (at least for me).  Since it is indeed much simpler than AF1 or any of the other AF, DWM, or SF systems, I'm calling it AutoFocus Zero (AF0), but I will rename it if there are objections (especially from Mark). The Zero in the name is also in the spirit of Merlin Mann's Inbox Zero approach (for email), where the ultimate goal is to process everything on the list.  I've been using AF0 now for only one day, and I like it a lot.  Here are the instructions (adapted from Mark's AF1 instructions).<br><br>___________________<br><br>AutoFocus Zero [AF0]<br><br>INTRODUCTION <br>The system consists of one long open list of everything that you have or want to do, written in a ruled notebook.  As you think of new items, add them to the end of the list.  You work through the list one page at a time in the following manner:<br><br>STEPS<br>1. Go through the page line by line, in order.  Work on each item for as long as you feel like doing so.  Rewrite it at the end of the list if you haven’t finished it.<br><br>2. If you cannot or do not want to do any work on an item, just delete it, or copy it to the end of the list as written, or rewrite it at the end so that it may be easier to start next time it comes around.  <br><br>3. Cross the item off the list, and continue Step 1 or 2 until the whole page is processed.<br><br>4. Move onto the next page and repeat the process (Steps 1-3).<br><br>5. The common-sense rule applies:  If something needs doing immediately, just do it.  It that case, you may scan forward to cross out the urgent item, or continue processing and cross it out when you get to it.<br><br>GUIDELINES<br>At the start of each day, it is a good idea to put the date in the right margin, on the first task entered that day.  If you don't get close to that dated line by the end of the day, your list is in danger of growing too large!  If the list grows to too many pages for your comfort level, be more ruthless by deleting items without rewriting.  Important tasks that cannot start for a few days can be transferred first into a calendar or tickler system, for re-entry at a later date, before deleting them from the list.  When it's time for a new notebook, resist the temptation to copy many pages of tasks into it.  Try to finish processing the old notebook within one day or so.  <br><br>Unlike more complicated systems, there is no looping at all in this process.  You move linearly through the list.  Page size doesn't matter.  The system is adaptable to electronic form, or even a stack of index cards.  One advantage to a handwritten notebook is that, as you proceed to each new item, it takes some effort to rewrite it at the end.  So if you cannot simply delete the task, you may decide that it's better to take some action rather than merely copying it forward mindlessly.  <br>___________________<br><br>What do you all think?</div>

<div class="content">ubi:<br><br>I've tried this system in the past and unfortunately it doesn't work very well. The problem is the length of time it takes to get to repeating tasks. Tasks repeat at varying intervals, yet this system basically means that you can't repeat a task until you have done something to every other task on the list. If for instance you want to check email several times a day, you can't because you have to do something to each of the 100 other tasks first. <br><br>Ok, you can use the common sense rule, but that's intended to be an exception - not something that needs to be used every few tasks.<br><br>When I first read your description I missed the bit about "Working on each item" and thought you meant just rotate a single pass through the list actioning only those tasks that stand out. This is also something I have tried in the past, and it works a lot better, though the lack of concentrating on one page at a time means that there is a tendency for only easy tasks to get done.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>I guess you've tried just about everything! I did think about the potential problem with wanting to  finish a task by the little-and-often approach, meaning several times per day. But your example problem – "If for instance you want to check email several times a day, you can't because you have to do something to each of the 100 other tasks first" – is not an issue for me, since I've implemented your checklists idea!  Anything that is routine can be put on a checklist, and triggered by time-of-day rather than rewriting it on the AF list.  I check email frequently out of habit anyway, but now I have three "Inb0" checklist items that need to be ticked as well, meaning clearing the Inbox to Zero soon after I arrive at the office, again after lunch, and lastly before I go home.<br><br>It's early days for me with this approach, and I cleared a backlog of several pages last night, so I'm down to only about 50 or so tasks on my list. This is manageable with the AF0 idea, although I do admit that I made more than exceptional use of the common-sense rule today. The new approach is pushing me to deal with a lot of small tasks that I had been skipping over previously. But I did finish a couple of big/difficult tasks today as well. Not ready to give up yet.</div>

<div class="content">Is this not just saying<br><br>- make a list of the things you need to do<br>- exercise the willpower and work needed to do them<br><br>For any of these systems that's what it comes down to.  AF works well at its basic level because it's capturing everything as a list.  GTD's inboxes equally work well.  It's the hard work needed to do the things on the list on which we all fall.  I think everyone here is an expert at the list making, but we're all equally lacking in the hard work and willpower.  A new system might get us fired up and produce results, but that's not because it's better at making lists and presenting tasks, it's because we've temporarily gotten a buzz and some willpower from the change.  Ultimately that change is a fun diversion from the work needed, and understanding *that* is the secret to getting stuff done.  Until then we are doomed to keep fiddling with systems, introspectively pushing our peas endlessly around the plate without eating anything.<br><br>Just my 0.02 sterling.</div>

<div class="content">Chris,<br><br>I have to say that by and large I agree with your sentiment.  However, two things should be noted:<br><br>1.  Some people (like me) genuinely are struggling to find an efficient way to manage vast amounts of work to do efficiently.  I've been helped quite a bit by some recent advice and it's already making my work load more manageable.  <br>2.  Some folks just really like the scientific pursuit of efficiency.  It's really not that different from people who love to work on cars, model airplanes, etc:  the hunt and process of finding an efficient system is thrilling.  There's absolutely nothing wrong with that.<br><br>If it's something that is not of interest to you, there's nothing wrong with that either.  I personally don't read the vast amount of information, permutations, ideas, etc on here because it would drive me batty trying to experiment with them all or even a small percentage.  At the end of the day I'm looking for a manageable way to get my work done.  What helps me in that regard is gold, the rest is dross.<br><br>Take care,<br><br>brett</div>

<div class="content">I like Chris's distillation down to two steps: 1. Make a list of the things you need to do.  2. Exercise the willpower and work needed to do them.  But the question is how to accomplish Step 2? All the systems we are trying consist of procedures to help with this. But in addition to the will to do hard work, we need a reality check from time to time about what we are actually willing and capable of accomplishing.</div>

<div class="meta">2012-01-7 18:24</div>
<div class="content">I think the various methods of making lists and rules are just a way to try and make the lists reflect what we are ready to do.  AF has dismissal to remove stuff that we're not ready to do.  GTD has Someday/Maybe lists and inactive items for stuff we're not ready to do.  So the nirvana is a list which always presents to us what we're ready and willing to do right now.<br><br>But here's the thing.  If we're ready and willing to do something, and we want to get it done, then we already know it and will do it.  AF has the standing out process to help us see those things.  GTD has contexts and sub-lists to help us see those things.  But it is our willpower and work that actually gets them done.<br><br>I fear that we often go around in circles looking for a system which will make us to do the stuff we don't want to do by somehow telling us what is good for us.  There's no such system; it's the tail wagging the dog.<br><br>The best we can have are individual tweaks to those two points I made earlier which help us see the stuff we already want or have to do, based on the way we work, the jobs we have, the resources around us and so on.  And then having the willpower to push through and get it done, piece by piece over time if needed.<br><br>I'm not talking prescriptively here.  I am talking from the point of view of seeing my own endless tweaking of lists a) not getting stuff done and b) wasting a lot of time while c) allowing me to feel I'm making progress.  I've spent the last half a year getting a load of unpleasant stuff done with basic lists of stuff, rolling up my sleeves and getting stuck in.  In some cases the last thing I want to do in the universe but doing it nevertheless.  And now it's done, not sat in an overdue list or a dismissed page.<br><br>I'd like to say I've been using AF but in fact I haven't.  I've just been making lists and notes so I don't forget things, and then doing them as best I can.  I can see now that's all I need, and by implication it's all anyone needs once they accept that their sleeves are rolled up and they're going to get metaphorically dirty.<br><br>(I guess that makes it 4p!)</div>

<div class="content">brett: "Some people (like me) genuinely are struggling to find an efficient way to manage vast amounts of work to do efficiently. I've been helped quite a bit by some recent advice and it's already making my work load more manageable."<br><br>What is work that needs to be done?  It's a commitment by you to make a change to something.  At work you provide that as a service in exchange for money.  At home you keep things in check (the bills, the garden, the car, etc).  Vast amounts of work represent some combination of needless complexity and sheer volume of commitments.<br><br>A system can help with the former by shining a spotlight into the work and paring it down to the resources you need (location, tools, etc), reducing redundancy and helping get an overview of it all.  It can help with the latter by providing that overview which helps you see where your limits are.<br><br>It fails to help with the former when it adds disproportionally more to the complexity (rules, maintenance, equipment), and fails to help with the latter when you're over-commited.  Only you can control your commitments.  I think sometimes here we're looking for a magical system which can take a snapshot of our life, overlay it on top of the ideal us, and present only what is needed to fullfill it while gracefully handling the overspill.  It's akin to "productivity anorexia", only seeing an image of ourselves instead of our reality.<br><br>I found in practice that peace comes in the form of getting that high-level overview of your commitments in the simplest way you're able, dealing with them and ensuring that incoming commitments are managed well.  A simple list or simple project tool helps me with that.  Getting stuck in and doing stuff even when it's not pleasant helps me with that.  I still fall over from time to time, it's about habits and mental attitude to them.  It takes time.  I only speak from my own experience and am not trying to come across like a smart arse.<br><br>brett: "Some folks just really like the scientific pursuit of efficiency. It's really not that different from people who love to work on cars, model airplanes, etc: the hunt and process of finding an efficient system is thrilling. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that."<br><br>I agree, it's fun in it's own right and we discover tips and tricks to help us along the way.  I like tinkering as much as anyone else.  However for me this is play time. not work time.  I have to draw a solid line between tinkering with systems and using a trusted system to help me manage my commitments, otherwise I fall into the trap of substiuting the tinkering for getting stuff done.  I've fallen into that trap so many times; it leads to stress and a feeling of despair and pushes me into the vicious circle of then looking further for the perfect system to fix it all.</div>

<div class="content">Okay, I hereby rename the processing method described above as the "4D" system.  As I thought about it more, there are only four ways to handle each to-do item if you want to proceed straight through in an ordered list. The first question to ask yourself is "Shall I simply Delete it?"  If not, the next question is "Shall I Defer it (take it off-list into a reminder system for reentry at a later time)?"  If not, the third question is "Shall I Delay it (by rewriting at the end)?"  If not, you've answered the fourth question "Shall I Do it (i.e. take some action) now?" affirmatively.  So the Four Ds (4D) are Delete-Defer-Delay-Do.<br><br>Mark, please change the title of this thread, if possible, to reflect the new name, so as not to cause confusion.  I'll revise and post new instructions in a new thread, if anyone is interested.</div>

<div class="content">To be honest, I'm less certain than Seraphim that my experimentation has netted an advantage, but I am certain it is now coming together. My estimation goes like this, using introspective effectiveness measures:<br><br>Before here I couldnt cope with work, and was maybe 2 points effective.<br>Then I found AF4, and I got 6 points but I wasn't properly focused. That lasted 4 months.<br> I tried DWM and scored 4.  So I experimented and meanwhile averaged 3.<br>After 6 months I succeeded and was chugging at 8, and much more focused. <br>Then SuperFocus and such came, and the confusion and experimenting brought me down to 5 for much of a year.<br>After that, I went my own way and achieved 9 for several months, but not consistently. <br>The latest though is doing really good and I believe I may soon reach 12.<br><br>So if I had stuck with AF4, I perhaps could have improved to a consistent 8 after two years and would have been ahead. But I'm quickly going to catch up now, and the long term (20 years) will easily prove its worth.</div>

<div class="content">I would mark that a 1.  Also, this is an open ended scale of effectiveness. There's no such thing as 100%, as even if you are always doing what needs doing, there are ways to do those things more efficiently, and ways to structure your life to be radically more effective. <br><br>Consider Steve Jobs as Apple's exec. Consider Tim Ferris' 4 hour workweek and 4 hour body. (at least the concept; I doubt Tim personally achieved everything he wrote about.)</div>
