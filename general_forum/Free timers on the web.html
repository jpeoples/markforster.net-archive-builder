<div class="content">Since I am back to timeboxing, I've discovered three nice countdown timers that are available as web pages.<br><br>1. Google! Just enter "timer" into <a href="http://www.google.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/</a> and you get a basic countdown timer.<br>It comes with a stopwatch in another tab.<br><br>2. <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/timer/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.timeanddate.com/timer/</a> - the most flexible. Allows multiple timers on one page with customizable names and alert sounds. You can start them all at once or separately by hand, or each can start automatically after the prior one stops.<br><br>3. <a href="http://e.ggtimer.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://e.ggtimer.com/</a> - very simple, has interesting modes such as Pomodoro, URL-based so you can bookmark a specific setup. Pops up an alert dialog on expiration, which pushes its window to the front of your screen.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, mate. I wasn't aware of any of these, and I'm a timer addict. They're all great. (Simplicity is the thing, in my view.)</div>

<div class="content">Nice to meet a fellow addict. I am prone to hyper-focusing, and I find timers extremely useful for reminding me to stop getting lost in my big project while the house falls down around me. The GED timebox method has also been great for busting through resistance. My taxes are mostly done now because of it, and my garage is about 1/3 sorted after 18 months of resistance.<br><br>It would all be perfect, if only I had another gadget to remind me: "Obey the timer!"</div>

<div class="content">I got a Gymboss last week. No earthly use for it, since I have about four independent timers already, quite apart from apps. <br><br>I wonder if anyone has any tips for consolidating the "Obey the timer!" imperative. (Apart from classical conditioning, of course, which requires forcing oneself in the beginning until the association is made.)</div>
