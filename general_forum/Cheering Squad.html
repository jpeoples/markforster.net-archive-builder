<div class="content">In another thread, Moises mentioned iDone. It looks like a great implementation of neat idea, but $60 / year is out of the budget.<br><br>Basically, it makes free-form daily reports easy. They are then compiled and sent to your teammates. Your teammates can comment on them. The system is intended it replace biweekly status meetings.<br><br>My idea is we make daily(ish) reports, and then cheer each other on. The content of the report would vary. Some timesI need to focus on things that went well and why, other times need to focus on three things to do today, other weeks I need to focus on grinding away at a big project. Perhaps a suggested word limit. maybe a suggested format.<br><br>Often during the day, I think, "No one really cares whether I do it or not." That's not true, but in the moment it can feel that way.<br><br>Yes, there will be a time delay. I might end the day by writing a report, or leave it till the next day. It will be another few days before everyone reads it.<br><br>Just an idea. Some days the idea appeals to me, other days I think it would be just one more narcissistic distraction.</div>

<div class="content">I use iDoneThis.com<br><br>I learned of it from Mark on this forum (if I remember correctly) and it is free.<br><br>I have used it for more than a year to record what went better that day, as Mark recommends in his Dreams book.</div>

<div class="content">Aha! Down there in the middle-size print, the free one. For personal use only though, not a team. It's been one of those weeks. I hate insomnia. No motivation at all.</div>

<div class="content">I would totally freak out having other people scrutinize my work this way, unless perhaps they are total strangers.   I am just too much of an introvert.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim,<br><br>iDoneThis is not seen by others. Furthermore, they don't even have my real name. Just a gmail account. I just get an email reminder each afternoon.<br><br>It's free. I don't share it with any team.<br><br>If you do want strangers to scrutinize your work there is a nifty app called tasksmash.com.<br><br>You can elect to have others view what you committed to do each day and whether you actually fulfilled your commitments. When I first started using it I saw a blog where two people were looking for others to track them. I emailed both of them. One of them stopped using the app almost immediately. The other gradually used it less and less.<br><br>Eventually I decided that the "social" aspect of this app was not adding any value and I stopped sharing it with anyone else.<br><br>taskSmash is a nice way to designate three (like Gerry and JD Meier, I like that number) results for each day. iDoneThis is a nice way to record what went better each day, and why.</div>

<div class="content">Nothing says you need to put details. It could be "Project A part 7". It all depends on actual audience, intended audience, and purpose.</div>
