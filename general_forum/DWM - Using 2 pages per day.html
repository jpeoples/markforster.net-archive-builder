<div class="content">I wonder of there is any advantage in using a 2 pages per day diary.<br><br>One one page could be listed all the immoveable activities for the day or scheduled items.<br><br>On the other pages could be listed all the DWM items.<br><br>This means having everything in one place and planning days with more information to hand. I'm not very good at doing any of these things so thought it could be an advantage.  However I may have overlooked some fatal flaw in my thinking!<br><br>Has anyone got any thoughts on this?</div>

<div class="content">I do the way you mention, but with a one-page-a-day planner: I simply divide (vertically) my page. <br><br>For me that's quite a nice advantage to have planning (Day events, due on that day tasks) and DWM on the same tool (manual).<br><br>Issue: I have to write with very small letters...</div>

<div class="content">Pascal,<br><br>do you manage it to go through all 31 pages every day with this method?<br>Just asking because I still find it difficult to go through all pages every day, although I use one diary/calendar solely for DWM, not for appointments etc. Those are in another calendar.</div>

<div class="content">Rainer<br><br>it's not a problem for me. It gives me the incentives to close all actions on the today page (I don't forget this meeting, I don't forget I commit to answer someone on that date, ...), includign doing something on the today DWM list and then, when "free time", I circulate on the 31 pages (including today) ant try to tackle some tasks/activities/... à la DWM.<br><br>I feel better with this new system (combine the way I explained) compare to the AF4 way, separate from my calendar.<br><br>Did I answer your point?<br>Pascal</div>

<div class="content">I've been doing this as well.  I use a Day-Timer 2-page per day calendar and it's working well so far.  I also like having everything in one place.</div>
