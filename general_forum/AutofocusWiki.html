<div class="content">I further divided the FAQ items into broader categories, and I "expanded" the first link into a actual question an selected answers. I took care to give credit and link to the original posts.<br><br>If anyone thinks I missed a good nugget in a thread or something is redundant, feel free to edit my changes. No registration is required.</div>

<div class="content">I've added some cross-links between the main FAQ and the sub-pages that Jim created, and a bit more content to most of his pages.</div>

<div class="content">I created a seperate 'ressources' section for most of Jim's pages. I think it makes sense to divide it like that. The FAQ should really contain questions and answers (as opposed to mere lists of links like it's now), and there is a lot of other information (reference material, as David Allen would call it) that has its own merit outside the FAQ.</div>

<div class="content">I'm unsure how to best categorize the FAQ. The first section should be about the basic Autofocus process, I think. E.g. just questions relating to Mark's original instructions . Then perhaps a general "howto" section with questions that go beyond the original instructions, e.g. how to handle paper, email, time-specific and urgent tasks etc. I'm not sure if we even need separate categories for paper-based and digital autofocus. That could go entirely into the ressources section and be referenced in a "Should I implement Autofocus with paper or digitally?" question.<br><br>What do you think?</div>

<div class="content">Perhaps the questions posted here (in this forum) could drive it?<br><br>- What does it mean to "dismiss" an item?"<br>- Do I lose dismissed items forever?<br>- What page do I start on tomorrow morning ... page 1 ... the page I was on ... the next page after that?  And what line item do I start on?<br>- I'm afraid I'll miss something buried on my list.  What should I do?<br>- How should I handle completed items? Should I cross off, check off, highlight, etc.?<br>- What are the pros and cons of paper vs digital?<br><br>I'm with you that it should not be links to discussions.  People go to FAQs to see the answers, not chase links and read.  Unfortunately it will require someone to read those discussions and answer the question in a fair and balanced way.<br><br>I also believe that a resources section would be helpful.  In that I would put links to journals, pens, whatever people have suggested that would be helpful.<br><br>I'm wondering if there should be a separate section on motivation.  It seems to be a big topic and yet it is not really part of the system, per se.  I'm not even sure what you'd put in that section as it is so much outside of AF.  OTOH, much of the discussion on this forum is about motivation, procrastination, etc.<br><br>Yet another outlier is the whole area of DIT, and CI, etc.  There is lots of discussion of the role of those ideas to augment AF, or somehow work within it.<br><br>Finally, I don't know if it pays to have a separate "tweaks" section.  I suppose many of the tweaks would be naturally covered in the questions about "how do I ...?", but maybe some would not.  I guess the problem there is if you outline the official AF rules and include the tweaks it would look something like:<br><br>- Put all of your tasks on the list ... except those which you might put on an index card<br><br>- Start at the first page ... except if you start at the last page<br><br>- Work forward ... unless you work backward or jump all around<br><br>- Keep working items on one page until you are done ... unless you do only one item per page<br><br>- Dismiss items when you can't do at least one ... unless you dismiss them early ... or unless you decide to keep them hanging around<br><br>- An item is done if you work on it ... unless you just think about working on it ;-)<br><br>It might be distracting to dump all of the tweaks on a person just starting out ... OTOH, it might be useful to present them in context with many cautions about trying it as written for at least a month before trying any tweaks.<br><br>Just some random thoughts this morning ;-)<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Wow!  Great work.  It's looking great already.  So far I think all of the changes make sense, it just needs more contributions and time to grow.<br><br>As for Mike's brainstorms, I agree that trolling through the forum will drive the wiki.  That's how I started the digital section--I use notebook & paper myself.<br><br>I agree it should not be all links to discussions.  However, significant quotes--especially from Mark Forster (properly linked and attributed) would be helpful.  In time, that's probably what the FAQ section will look like anyway.<br><br>I would personally stay away from a "tweaks" section.  That seems to me to be much better suited to the discussion board.  Maybe a "tips and tricks" section with information on more minor things like how you mark or tear off the corner of a page--little things like that rather than larger changes to the system.<br><br>But that's the cool thing about a group wiki.  Just like AF we can throw everything we like at it and let it sort itself out.<br><br>Thanks!<br><br></div>
