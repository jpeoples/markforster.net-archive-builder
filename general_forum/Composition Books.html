<div class="content">For the U.S. people only.  If you've not noticed, Wal-Mart is having a back to school sale and the regular "composition" books are selling for $0.50 each.  Normally they are between $1 and $2.  They make good general purpose log books or record books or thinking or note taking or just about anything books.  They'd also make a pretty fair AF book.<br><br>Just FWIW.</div>

<div class="content">Commenting on my own post just to bump it to the top ;-)<br><br>Just a reminder, for USA folk.  If you use "composition books" for your AF list, or Journal, or grass catcher, or project planning, or ... just about anything, Wal-Mart has them on the "back to school" sale for $0.50 each.  Pretty amazing when my pocket spiral notebook cost almost $1.00!  Oh, and they come in colors now too.  And some black and white patterns that will make you nauseous.  LOL ;-)</div>

<div class="content">We'll have to wait a few weeks here in Canada Mike - our school session doesn't start for another couple of weeks.  <br>I've found these handy for journaling - the covers are very sturdy so they're more portable than the flimsy spirals where the covers can get ripped from the spiral.<br></div>

<div class="content">I'm not sure ours is too close either.  Usually in September.  But the sale here has been going on for a month or more.  I dunno.  I just love those books.  I like that they lie flat and they don't catch on anything.</div>

<div class="content">And they have wide lines - never underestimate the benefit of wide lines.  :-)</div>

<div class="content">Hmmmm, that's odd.  I usually like narrow lines ... but thinking about it, I do love the wider lines on the Composition Books.  I guess when I'm thinking (rather than taking notes) I like to have lots of white space.  With notes, I like to cram it all in.</div>

<div class="content">I just got the Staples ad ...<br><br>$0.25 each for composition books ... maximum 5<br>$1.00 each for six pack of various colored highlighters ... maximum 2.<br><br>Other stuff such as printer paper and all that kind of stuff.  Otherwise, Staples is one of the more expensive stores.</div>

<div class="content">It's usually between Staples or Office Max for me.  Office Depot is consistently higher than either, though Office Max is usually just under Office Depot by a few pennies. I am there mostly for my pens, Uni Ball Vision Elite or Pentel Energel Metal Tip strangely a finer line than their needle point "fine").<br><br>But to get back on thread topic, I have several composition books, but rarely use them, mostly for the wide lines, just the opposite of you, Mike.<br><br>What I do miss are the Mead Lil' Comp books, 3.5 in x 6 in, 50 sheets, with sewn binding. If those were still in production, I probably never would have gotten my Miquelrius Flexible Pocket Notebook (nah, not true).  These were very durable, even in my back pocket and only once did I ever have to reinforce them with packing tape. I still have a few left and am saving them for something special; not gonna waste them on work now!</div>

<div class="content">I agree with you about the demise of some nice products.  Even some marginally useful ones.  I used to get these Mead 4x6 spiral books, 80 sheets, vertical format, hard back, sturdy cover, nice to keep in my pocket for general notes.  I got them at Wal-Mart for $0.94.  One day they vanished.  In their place were these cheap Chinese knockoffs ... only about 40 or so pages, the back was flimsy ... it would not even provide a good platform for writing... the cover was even more flimsy.  And the paper ... newsprint was all I can come up with to describe it ... it was not that, but just about as bad ... some kind of greyish recycled crap.  The corker was that it was priced at something just under $2.00.  Unbelievable.  I'm not a believer in paying big money for scratch paper ... which is about how I view that book ... I expect it to last a while but in the long run I'm not going to archive it ;-)  However, enough is enough!<br><br>The books I used to like are those sold to the government for use in the military and other agencies.  Typical awful green, but sturdy, sewn, and just plain effective.  I've not been able to find those again.  Next time I meet someone in the military I ought to see if they still make those and if they are obtainable without a top secret clearance ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Not sure what size Record book you are looking for, but the ones that are about 8" X 10.5" are NSN 7530-00-222-3525.  I found several references to them, but only one public source:<br>https://www.redcheetah.com/lci/item_details.php?sess_id=4cb7dab8759395d0d11f7ce3a2a3ff10&sku=107651<br><br>Some of the sources give better descriptions.  I think they are required to be acid free paper since they are designed to be used for long term record keeping.  Folks in the military either love them or hate them, no matter what size.</div>
