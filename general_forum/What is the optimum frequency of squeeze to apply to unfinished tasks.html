<div class="content">Of all the systems listed on this website, which apply the optimum frequency of squeeze to unfinished tasks without a due date? <br><br>Perhaps Mark has some refreshing ideas on the subject that he can share here or perhaps has described in his upcoming book!<br><br>The assessments below may need correction, but let's have a look at when the squeeze seems to be applied to unfinished tasks in the following systems:<br><br><br>DIT: Pressure is applied once daily and when an audit is triggered <br><br>AF: Pressure is applied as a page nears dismissal<br><br>AF2: Pressure is applied when it nears the end of the list<br> <br>AF4: Pressure is applied once the unfinished task becomes part of the next "old list" and that list nears dismissal<br><br>AF4 Revised: Pressure is applied in the form of wanting the task to be finished, feeling the task is about to lose its value, or feeling the unfinished list has grown too long<br> <br>DWM: Pressure is applied once every 7 days<br><br>SF: Pressure is applied on every page turn<br><br>FV: Pressure is applied when the task reaches the end of the list<br><br>3T: Pressure is applied when you run out of two other tasks you can add to the list<br> <br>SMEMA: Pressure is applied (at minimum) after having actioned two tasks every time it's re-entered<br><br>Jefferson Nickel: Pressure is applied when you reach the last pages<br><br>UTMS: Pressure is applied when the old list nears dismissal<br><br>UTMS Improved: Pressure is applied during every pass through the old list</div>

<div class="content">You've identified the time factor in each system, but that's really only half the story. The other half is the threat - i.e. what happens if you don't do the task.</div>

<div class="content">So to determine the optimum frequency of pressure to apply, one must first choose the optimum form of threat to the user if they don't do the task. Then it will be clear how often to apply it.</div>

<div class="content">It's quite a balancing act. If you apply too much pressure, then resistance will rise against the whole system and may result in its being abandoned.<br><br>If you don't apply enough pressure then the emphasis will be on easy trivial tasks.<br><br>Interestingly when you're just told what to do by a randomizer resistance doesn't seem to arise to the same extent. That's probably because energy is not being drained by decision fatigue.</div>
