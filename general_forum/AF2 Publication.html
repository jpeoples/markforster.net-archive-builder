<div class="content">Let me attempt to be the first to say: yippee! (And perhaps the last to use that particular word.)</div>

<div class="content">I am fully enjoying my last day of procrastination freedom,  before tomorrow it was a lack of method,  after tomorrow it will just be a sin :) (and now is the time to remember some Oscar Wilde quote)</div>

<div class="content">Mark - you've recommended that you would begin a new list when starting AF 2.0. But what about the 7 pages of projects/tasks on my AF list?</div>

<div class="content">The  Ambassador is truly spoiling us with his updated version of Autofocus! <br><br>Mark, I'd like to express big respect to you for acknowledging some of the possible weaker areas of AF and striving to improve on them - I do not hear of any other time management 'gurus' (for want of a better word) doing that - even when the tide of popularity begins to turn.<br><br>Unfortunately,  I never really got off the ground with AF for several reasons but I stuck around because I believe in your ideas and in the supportive nature of the forum. So I look forward to your publication tommorow and reading everyone's comments and feedback.</div>

<div class="content">Finally.  I, too, am really looking forward to the release of AF2.  I have been working with AF since end of May and really like it, but realize that there are some deficiencies (perhaps in my implementation) and it sounds very promising that some of these sources of discomfort are going to be addressed.<br><br>Mark L. :)</div>

<div class="content">Mark - Thanks for the AF2.  I am a big fan of AF, and had found myself spending a lot of time at the end of the list.  I am trying them at the weekend, and the updates in v2 I think will be fun and useful.  Thanks again - Rebecca</div>
