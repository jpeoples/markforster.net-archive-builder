<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>I saw this post today, but am confused.  I thought you were not working on a new system.  Have you changed your mind?  Thanks<br><br><br>"New AF" (for want of a better name) will make most of this discussion irrelevant anyway.<br>June 18, 2009 at 12:29 | Registered CommenterMark Forster <br><br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">Gerry:<br><br>Yes, I am working on a new system. I explained on this Forum that I had solved one of the problems which had let me to abandon the new system. As a result I have gone back to testing it.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>Oh really?  I guess I did not see the discussion where you solved a major problem and started testing your new system again.  The last I heard was that you gave up and were sticking with standard AF -- with comments like where this will take you over the long run.<br><br>This sounds intriguing.  But you do realize that I would not be me if I did not ask this...do you have a sense when all of us will see your new system?  Is it a matter of weeks?  Months?  What is your best guess?<br><br>Best wishes,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">I simply don't know, David. I had another idea today for improving the new system and I've got to test that out. I don't want to release it until it's as good as I can make it.</div>

<div class="content">Oh...and one more thing...will we be able to use our current AF lists -- my great spiral-bound notebook -- with your new system?<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">I believe that Mark has said that you can use your current AF notebooks with the new system and that if you wish to return to the standard AF later, you can use the notebooks from the new system.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Chris,<br><br>Thanks!  This is indeed good news because AF is working well for me -- and using a paper, spiral-bound notebook.  As someone who normally is so digital in their work, I am finding this simple system to be incredibly refreshing.<br><br>Best wishes,<br>-David</div>
