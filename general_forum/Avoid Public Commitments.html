I remember reading that a good way to get something done is to commit to it publicly.<br><br>Lo and behold this can actually reduce the likelihood of getting that thing done.<br><br><a href="http://www.heidigranthalvorson.com/2013/01/the-surprising-reason-we-break-promises.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.heidigranthalvorson.com/2013/01/the-surprising-reason-we-break-promises.html</a></div>

<div class="content">The referenced blog posting seems like a lot of psychobabble to me.  The example cited - offering to babysit - was never acknowledged in an accountable way.  The mom should've said "Okay, great, how about coming over Tuesday right after lunch?"  That would've set the stage for a true commitment, or a clear dialogue showing that it wasn't a real offer.<br><br>Similarly, if you make a commitment to a boss or colleague, there should be a clear deadline established, and the party accepting the offer should gently remind the offeror of it, and follow up if the deadline passes and the work is not done.  If the environment doesn't reinforce accountability for keeping promises, the blame shouldn't fall solely on the person who breaks them.  If the environment is such that broken promises have consequences, people won't make empty ones.</div>

<div class="content">How to be loved by productive people (and hated by the rest) when in the role of Secretary: "Just to confirm: B has volunteered to do that, but I didn't hear when he'll have it done by." You can guess why I started that habit, and why.</div>
