<div class="content">After some time with AF2 I kind of start missing the "gamely feeling" of how AF1 handled a page as a closed list. "Do something about one thing on this list or feel the pain of having to dismiss all of it!" - this rule sometimes got me attacking something unpleasant just because it was LESS unpleasant than the rest!<br><br>The big advantage of AF (and, so to say, it's source of energy) was that it eliminated procrastination to a bigger degree than any other method I ever encountered. And playfully.<br><br>AF2 handles urgent items better than AF1, but I am not sure whether this comes at the cost of more procrastination.<br><br>I would like to know what others think.</div>

<div class="content">Andreas,<br><br>I tossed that around a bit and have not come to any conclusion yet.  I had thought of using both methods of dismissal simultaneously:<br><br>- dismiss the oldest small block after a day on notice, AND<br>- dismiss any page I encounter where I am not willing to work on at least one item.<br><br>The problem I saw was that it would further limit my ability to get back to the block "on notice" as it seems that the way others are getting there is by doing little or nothing on the intervening pages.  So I've not found the combination yet.<br><br>As to the actual amount of procrastination, I see where AF2 rewards procrastination for many middle tasks but forces you to get the old ones done.  So it is a mixed bag, I guess.</div>

<div class="content">I personally am experiencing much less procrastination with AF2 compared with AF.<br><br>I would not go back to AF1 (much as I liked it), now that I can see the improvements in action.<br><br>Part of the improvement may be attributable to moving from electronic to handwritten, and consolidation to a single list.</div>

<div class="content">AndreasE: I have the same feeling, I'm missing the closed list-effect that made beating procrastrination into a game. Can't say I have given AF2 a real chance to prove it self yet though, but the lack of closed lists sort of makes me question how it would work for me.<br><br>/jonaz<br></div>

<div class="content">I definitely like the way that AF2 enables you to stay current without allowing you to leave items hanging around for ever.  I feel that having just converted my old list I have a lot of variety of tasks and am finding much less procrastination in that there is always something that stands out whereas I had found I was having to choose from the lesser of a very small number of evils in AF1 and therefore had deliberately left a few "easy" tasks to make that easier.  I can now clear those tasks without problem and so reduce items and am finding less resistance to old tasks because I feel I have more choice as to when I do them.</div>

<div class="content">Frankly, in the moment I am considering to return to AF1.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Andreas,<br><br>I can identify with AF1 giving you more energy and in a playful way encourage you to do high resistance items!<br><br>That said though with both AF1 and AF2 there is the risk of *easy* items 'standing out' all the time. Unfortunately this actually means you are simply procrastinating on what you know you should to be doing right now.<br><br>AF1 makes it easier to do this because you are on different pages all the time. And hence you can procrastinate on the main thing you should be doing legitimately. Since you're sticking to the system you might not even consciously know you are procrastinating most of the time but deep in your heart you always know....<br><br>Could it be that AF2 makes this sense of procrastination come to the surface more for you since you are now every time considering the whole list when you pick the next task?<br><br>Maybe this is a good thing?<br><br>The bad news... You now have no excuse to not get started with the main high resistance item.<br><br>Attack it head on, may the force be with you!!</div>
