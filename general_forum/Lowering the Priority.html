<div class="content">As Mark says, raising the priority of one thing is the same as decreasing the priority of everything else.<br><br>What if, instead of raising a priority of a few and lowering the priority of all the rest, we reversed it: Lower the priority of a few, thereby raising the priority of everything else.<br><br>New Question:<br><br>How disappointed would I be if I did not make progress on this project in the next hour? Few hours? Day?<br><br>If not very, then lower the priority. Somehow mark which lines are, for now, of lower priority. Use system of your choice on the remaining lines.<br><br>Dot (or star) most lines, since you don't have very many low-priority things on the list, right? (If too many things don't get a dot, time for an audit.)</div>
