<div class="content">@ Nuntym, in the 'What is your favourite notebook for AF or SF?' thread:<br><< I use AF only at home, work is too fast paced for it. >><br><br>Hi Nuntym, I found your comment above rather arresting. I was hoping you wouldn't mind expanding a bit on it...?<br><br>Many thanks</div>

<div class="content">+JMJ+<br><br>Sorry for the very late reply.<br><br>I work as a dialysis patient care technician.  My work is actually very defined and technical, with schedules laid out already for me, and this job really needs high mental concentration so that I do not get late in preparing the machines and putting on and taking off patients from the dialysis machines, so AF just becomes superfluous.</div>

<div class="content">+JMJ+<br><br>And oh yes, I work three times a week ranging from 14 to 18 hours per shift, so that cuts off time for myself, and also the reason I post here less often than I usually do.</div>

<div class="content">> this job really needs high mental concentration<br>>14 to 18 hours per shift<br><br>Obviously this is outside your area of control, nuntym, but don't you find these two points dangerously conflicted?</div>

<div class="content">It's not that the work is too fast paced for AF as such. AF and all my other systems are designed for managing discretionary time. Where there is no discretionary time they are not appropriate.</div>

<div class="content">Nuntym, thank you for replying. Doing 14-18 hour shifts in a medical job sounds both terrifying and exhausting.<br><br>Alan and Mark, thank you for your comments. Particularly Mark for the reminder that AF is for discretionary time. I lost sight of that basic principle.</div>
