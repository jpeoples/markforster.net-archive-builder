<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2008-03-5 20:26</div>
<div class="content">Well, my quest to work with daily will-do lists in my hybrid of GTD and DIT continues. So I created my daily will-do list of what I really, really wanted to get done today. These actions were taken from my next actions list (GTD part). I started off the day...and then things started happening. Two of my graduate students show up at my door with experimental and project design issues that needed to be discussed immediately. While I was talking with them, I received 10 emails, all of which contained issues that needed addressing as soon as possible as well. Then two phone calls from collaborators from other universities on grant issues. None of these could be planned, or prevented as I do extensive planning on all of my projects. This is just my life sometimes with a large lab group and several NIH grants. Some days, I can create a focus list and work diligently all day with minimal interruptions and really match the closed list approach. Then there are days like today where I am hit hard constantly.<br><br>Mark, I need your advice here. I know I have too many commitments, projects, etc. but that is not ever going to change.  I am a full professor at a major research university here in the USA and facutly here routinely work 60+ hours/week.  With major research grants, a large lab group, etc, it is really hard some days to create a closed list and then not suffer what I described above.  I do like DIT because it provides better structure than pure GTD, where one decides moment to moment on what to do next from next actions lists.  However, with days like today...and they are frequent...how does one use the DIT system without being overwhelmed?<br><br>Thanks,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Dear David<br><br>Your post raises several very important issues, and I think that, rather than write one long reply, I will do a series of smaller posts. So here goes with the first issue which is the compatibility of GTD with DIT.<br><br>I think part of your problem is that you are not really using either GTD or DIT properly, but are falling between two stools. I'm not an expert on GTD so I will confine my answer to DIT.<br><br>As I understand it you are making up your Will Do list every day from your GTD next actions list. Now this may be a perfectly valid way of proceding, but it's definitely not DIT!<br><br>You are missing out on an essential part of the DIT system (probably the most essential part) which is the Task Diary. The Task Diary is made up from:<br><br>a) Items which are date specific (i.e. must be done on a certain day or can't be started until a certain day)<br><br>b) Next actions on your projects. It is a principle of DIT that you should always take action on a deadlined project as soon as it is possible to do so - regardless of the project deadline.<br><br>c) All tasks which come in during the day, which are either put down for tomorrow (preferably), or the current day (if essential).<br><br>You will notice that this is not an arbitrary choice out of a long list of possible tasks. It consists of *all* the work that is due that day.<br><br>This is because the most fundamental principle of DIT is that one day's incoming work must equal one day's outgoing work. Because the time available one day is never going to equal exactly the incoming work, we are talking about on average. Therefore it's ok to fall behind for a few days, but not for longer than 4 or 5 days.</div>

<div class="meta">2008-03-6 11:13</div>
<div class="content">Dear David<br><br>The second important issue raised by your email is the one of interruptions. You mention three examples of interruptions. Let's have a look at them.<br><br>Remember that in DIT there are three degrees of urgency - "immediate", "same day" and "everything else". Which degree of urgency you allocate to an interruption determines how you deal with it.<br><br>The graduate students are an example of "immediate". They don't have to be - but the way you've got it organised they are. Remember that with "immediate" items the solution to any problem is a matter of organisation, not time management.<br><br>10 emails containing issues that need addressing as soon as possible. Now how do you define "as soon as possible" here? Are these "same day" issues? Generally speaking, people don't send emails about issues for which they *really* need an answer the same day. They use the phone. So these can probably be done tomorrow - DIT's default setting. If not, do them today by all means.<br><br>Two phone calls about university issues. Answering the phone is "immediate" (though you can organise it so it isn't all the time). But dealing with the issues isn't necessarily. If action comes out of the phone calls it can usually be done tomorrow.<br><br>The idea is that allocating the correct priority to interruptions allows you to impose order upon chaos by interposing a buffer of the appropriate length. In DIT the default buffer is "do it tomorrow".<br><br></div>

<div class="meta">2008-03-6 11:29</div>
<div class="content">Dear David<br><br>The next issue is: Do unexpected interruptions throw DIT out?<br><br>The answer is No - provided that you are using your Task Diary and Will Do list correctly.<br><br>One can do a lot to minimise interruptions by good organisation and systems, but life is never going to be so predictable that you don't have any interruptions. <br><br>In DIT if you get more than the usual amount of interruptions during the day and the result is that you don't complete your Will Do list, then you simply carry it forward to the next day.<br><br>But it is essential that you catch up after a few days. If you don't, then you need to go through the audit procedure (Too much work? Working efficiently? Enough time?) and adjust your work accordingly. Otherwise you will be back into chaos.<br><br>Also remember that once you have taken action on the audit, you should catch up on outstanding work by making it into a backlog and dealing with it as such.<br><br>I'll deal next with the questions you raise about having too much work. But I'm due out for lunch with a colleague now, so it will have to wait until later.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>Thanks so much for your very helpful insights and advice.  I can see now that trying to create a GTD/DIT hybrid may not work so well.  I like the structure of DIT, so I need to go back and rethink how I am doing things.<br><br>I hope you enjoy your lunch -- it is morning here -- across the big pond...<br><br>Best regards,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Hi, David<br><br>Glad you appreciated my replies so far - and thanks, yes, the lunch was very good: in an oak-beamed pub in the heart of the Sussex countryside (The Three Horseshoes at Elsted if you are ever in these parts!)<br><br>I just wanted add a few remarks about having too much work. The real question is "Do you get all your work completed to the standard which it deserves?"<br><br>If you do, then you don't have a problem with overload.<br><br>But assuming that you do have a problem, then the question I would want to ask is "How do you decide at the moment what gets done well, what gets done less than well, and what doesn't get done at all?"<br><br>The answer most people would give to that question is "I don't decide it consciously. It just happens."<br><br>Well, the whole point of auditing your workload in DIT is to make conscious decisions as to what is going to get done, rather than letting it "just happen". Surely that is a better way to proceed?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>Thanks again for your help -- it greatly appreciated!<br><br>I do manage to get my work done...well....I am bit overloaded, but DIT is going to help me manage that much better.  One real problem with GTD and massive next action lists is that they never seem to end AND one does not gain a good sense if one could really do all of the actions that are put on the lists.<br><br>Thanks again, and if you want, I can share more of how my DIT setup over time helps me manage my many responsibilities and projects, I would be glad to provide periodic updates on my progress.<br><br>Take care,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Tasks that cannot be planned and accomodated for beforehand are the biggest problem for with closed list approach. I work in R&D. Most of my work is with projects that have deadlines weeks or months ahead. Usually my days are predictable.<br><br>The closed list approach has been of great help for me. I make a closed list for the next day adding items from my projects. This way I get some focus on my work and know exactly if I have managed to get enough things done for the day. The closed list gives an incentive to complete a day's work. I even keep a score every day based on if I have completed my list (1 point) or not (0 points). Completing the list gives also peace of mind - I know I have done enough and can relax the rest of the day.<br><br>However, sometimes I feel like David. Part of my work consists of testing new product features where all sorts of problems and bugs are common. Sometimes these assignments are unexpected, have to be done immediately (so that other people can proceed with their work) and you may not be able to say beforehand if there is going to be a problem and if the task is going to take five minutes or five hours. <br><br>One day this week I had planned a regular closed list, but in the morning I was told to work on a problem. It wasn't until 4 pm I was finally done with it. Only then I could have a look at my list for the day and see what I had actually planned to do. <br><br>Ok, Mark says you can't balance your workload everyday and I can easily move items to the next day. Yes, but mentally I have a problem with this. Which tasks on my list should I try to do as I cannot do everyone? How many tasks should I still try to do? When can I happily say I am done for the day and relax even if I have not completed my list? Can I give myself a point for doing my list even if I have not completed it but have worked hard and done my best?</div>

<div class="content">Nick<br><br>To answer your questions:<br><br>1) Which tasks on my list should I try to do as I cannot do every one? I'd go for any that are urgent first. After that it doesn't matter.<br><br>2) How many tasks should I still try to do? You should continue working until your normal stopping time.<br><br>3) When can I happily say I am done for the day and relax even if I have not completed my list? At your normal stopping time.<br><br>4) Can I give myself a point for doing my list even if I have not completed it but have worked hard and done my best? No.<br><br>I'm not clear from what you say whether you are in fact working the DIT system properly. When you say "adding items from my projects" it sounds as if you are making an arbitrary selection from a larger master list. As I said to David, this is a perfectly valid way of proceeding, but it's not DIT.<br><br>I suggest you re-read my answers to David carefully.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark<br>I got a completely different interpretation.  I automatically assumed that he was using the Little and Often principle and pulling actions from either a projects grid or a projects timeline.  Also it's a systematic way to advance more than one project simultaneously.<br>vickie</div>

<div class="meta">2008-03-9 17:28</div>
<div class="content">Hi Mark<br>LOL!  Quite true.  I suppose that I automatically interpretted it that way because projects actions or timeboxes are the main residents of my Daily List! The projects grids and timelines guide me. Yet, the Daily List is what galvanizes my motivation and focus!  LOL!  I even work my daily checklist similar to a project format with weekly round-up days for each subset...i.e. emails, paper, bills, pending/follow-up, administration, etc....That way I'm never more than a week behind with any of it no matter what life hands me!  LOL!<br><br>I say...I say....there's a method to my madness (perhaps only understood by me!  ROTFL!)<br><br>vickie</div>

<div class="meta">2008-03-9 17:40</div>
<div class="content">*blush*  That didn't read quite right.  I aim to do the checklist each day (unless I'm going to go full throttle on a project(s) because either the creavity is there or my pain has sufficiently abated and I want to grab that rare opportunity....pain is a huge distractor)<br>but,...but...but...even if I miss some of the checklist items, there is a round-up day that REQUIRES me to be current on it.  That actually motivates me to stay current and check off the prompt at the BEGINNING of the day as already done....my little variant of staying current via little and often or one thing at a time.....depending on either the demands of the day or week or......the opportunities of the day or week!  *blush* <br>vickie</div>

<div class="meta">2008-03-9 18:43</div>
<div class="content">Thank you for the quick reply!<br><br>The problem with the stopping time is that mine is pretty flexible. Some days I work until 4 pm, some days until 6 pm and sometimes I continue even later but generally I try to avoid this. Therefore I it is hard to know when to stop if there are unfinished tasks on my closed list. Perhaps I should set a general stopping time (say 5 pm) by which my list should be completed. I then may continue working if I feel like but completing the list 'doesn't count' if you understand what I mean. <br><br>Sorry, I was unclear how I make my list. If I get a new work assignment which takes weeks or even months to complete (I call it a project), I add it to my next day's list. The following day I then work out main steps needed to complete the project. At the moment I have three this kind of work projects ongoing and I have a list of the main steps for each project, a list that I update regularly.<br><br>I try to work on each project every day unless there is something urgent or special issues. For tommorow's list I work out the tasks of each project based on those main steps and more importantly the new issues and ideas that have arosen today.<br><br>Apart from the projects list I do not have a master list of such but a largish backlog list of tasks that should have been completed earlier and which I know try to do one by one. These projects that I have are not and have not been on the backlog list.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Nick,<br><br>I am the original poster.  I too have many of your issues as I pointed out.  I am transitioning from GTD to DIT.  One of the biggest problems I have had with GTD is the never-ending, growing next actions lists and not ever getting the sense of getting things done, which I know is ironic.  However, I have colleagues who thrive on GTD because they like the inherent flexibility of choosing next actions and not working from a pre-determined, closed list.  They also liken our work -- and it seems like yours as well -- as 24/7 work where there really is not a "regular" day of work and it never ends -- it truly is 24/7 sometimes.  As I described in my original post, I have many days in which things come at me so hard and fast -- and yes -- many of them have to be addressed that day -- that I am a bit worried that DIT will frustrate me somewhat.  What I mean is that I will have so many days in which I cannot complete my will-do list and have to carry things over that I will feel defeated.<br><br>But maybe not -- we will see.  I do know I like more structure and daily plans.  With GTD, I just kept addding next actions to the point where I had no idea if I would ever be able to accomplish all of it. And yet, I added more...and more.  With DIT, I think I am going to feel much more in control.<br><br>Please continue to share your experiences here as I will do so.  Mark, I still think DIT is THE BEST method and so I hope you comment on all of our descriptions of our struggles.<br><br>Best to all,<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="meta">2008-03-10 11:56</div>
<div class="content">Mark: Do you think you could elaborate a little bit more about where you said having a master list of Project next actions is not DIT. This is the one bit of DIT I haven't really got my head around... where I am supposed to record all project related tasks that are not next actions?  <br><br>I run a small industrial design consultancy, so I  have a nice mix of project work, getting work in and running the  business. Keeping on top of project status/tasks etc is obviously quite important - particularly CRM stuff in trying to win jobs.<br><br>So I think we need a project master list type arrangement, where we can breakdown all the tasks for a project. But how does this sit with DIT - if I try to programme all this on my task diary, it would just become a disaster zone as stuff shifts around - even if it's electronic it would take so much effort to keep bumping stuff around the diary that it wouldn't be worth it. <br><br>So the only option I can see is to keep a GTD style master projects/tasks list and pluck the next action items off this during reviews to build daily closed lists. If anything must be done on a certain day then of course it is given a due date and so appears in that days list to begin with. Non-essential tasks that come in during the day are placed on tomorrow's list.<br><br>Am I right in thinking that in your eyes that having any kind of project/task master list is the wrong approach? In which case can you explain where I should keep the 350 or so items currently on my master list?<br><br>Thanks in advance if you can help help clear up my addled confusion!<br><br>Andrew<br><br></div>

<div class="meta">2008-03-10 12:50</div>
<div class="content">Dear Andrew<br><br>You need to make a distinction between managing the project and managing yourself within the project. An example would be building a bridge between the Isle of Wight and the English mainland. The project planning for this would obviously be very complicated and would involve loads of plans, charts, specifications, coordination, etc. I have absolutely nothing to say on this subject - as I have said many times DIT is not a textbook on project management.<br><br>However you as manager of the project have tasks which are specifically for you to do. These will include tasks such as planning, drawing up specifications, hiring, etc. Basically everything you have to do comes down to a series of small actions on your part. This is what DIT addresses.<br><br>So,yes, you need tons of charts, lists, specification, etc for the managing of the project. But no, you don't need to duplicate all these things in order to manage yourself within the project.<br><br>Your basic tool for self-management is the Task Diary. If there are three tasks for Project A which you can do now, then put all three in your Task Diary for tomorrow. When you do each one, ask yourself "What's next?" If you have to consult the detailed plans for the project that's fine. With most small projects you won't have to - you'll know yourself without looking. If you can't do anything further for that project for a while then schedule a review in a week or so. If you can do something further, then put it in your task diary for tomorrow.<br><br>So the question is: Which of the "350 items on your master list" could be done now? These should all be on your task diary for tomorrow. <br><br>However since you haven't been applying the principles of DIT correctly you probably have too many items to fit into one day. This is a backlog and you should treat it as such.<br><br>If you have way too many items to stand a hope of catching up even by declaring a backlog, then you have learnt something interesting - you've got too much work. What are you going to do about it?</div>

<div class="content">Dear Mark<br><br>Thank you very much for your detailed reply - I really appreciate the time you spend on this. This is the only book I've read where you can get such excellent replies from the author to help understand it!<br><br>From what you've said I think I'm basically doing the right thing... The software I use (my life organised) acts as the sort of big project planning tool for the  building my dream life project, (rather than "build a bridge to the Isle of Wight"). Obviously there's lots of sub-projects within this lot, which have lots of tasks including the next action tasks. I can then use the next action tasks that I can do now to build my DIT closed lists/task diary. <br><br>I very much like your point about drawing the distinction between "the plan" and my actions related to the plan. Obviously you can measure your performance against the closed lists/task diary, but not against the big master list plan which will change but never diminish. <br><br>Hmmm a bit clearer I think - thanks!</div>

<div class="meta">2008-03-13 4:00</div>
<div class="content">Hi Mark, <br><br>I realize you have written a fair bit about project planning recently, and I have read it. Thanks. I struggle with this one myself, perhaps due to the GTD concept. <br><br>The GTD project list includes all items I want to do ASAP which are not "one-shot" actions, ie. I can't "do" them as a physical activity. When I have more of these than I can tackle in a day, GTD suggests I put them on a master list, and review them often so I don't forget them. <br><br>If I have more projects than I can reasonably move forward in one day, I take it that you recommend placing those reminders at inervals within my Task Diary, with an eye on their required completion date. This then functions as my reminder system rather than a list. Is this correct? <br><br>In other words, if I am to take on a commitment, you would expect me to think it through a bit more thoroughly up front than simply adding it to a list because it is a "project". And, by entering my "thinking" into my task diary going forward, I am able to get a better idea of my workload as well. Is this right?<br><br>Thanks for the feedback,<br>Gordon<br><br></div>
<h2>Reply by Mark Forster</h2>
<div class="meta">2008-03-13 8:26</div>
<div class="content">Dear Gordon<br><br>Basically you are correct. What I object to is not the idea of planning a project and having lists etc to track it - I object to the idea of having a list of possible project actions from which one makes an arbitrary decision as to what to do. This is what GTD, in my understanding of it, encourages one to do.<br><br>I am a bit concerned about your phrase "if I have more projects than I can reasonably move forward in one day". If you can't move them all forward today, then when are you going to move them forward? Tomorrow, when you have even more projects? The trouble with putting work back until you have time to do it is that more work comes in in the meantime and fills the gap. That's why it is so important to keep the number of projects you have continuously audited.<br><br>The basic DIT philosophy regarding the date you should commence working on a project with a deadline (real or implied) is that you should start working on it at the beginning of the available time window, rather than towards the end of it.</div>
<h2>Reply by Gordon</h2>
<div class="meta">2008-03-14 0:43</div>
<div class="content">Thanks for the reply Mark. It helps. I understand that I *should* be able to move all projects forward to some degree during one day. <br><br>What I meant practically was that depending on the day, that might mean only a brief period of time on each one. If I make an "executive decision" to focus on one or two projects today, I might lose track of others. In fact, if I am interrupted by something very pressing from my boss, and it will consume my time for a couple of days, I am in just that position. <br><br>If I have the projects I must put off on a project list, I am reminded of them when it is time to "pick-up" or (particularly) when I have time to choose my work again and must decide between the critical and the important versus the trivia. <br><br>So, is your alternative to put them on the Task Diary for tomorrow? Sorry if I am being obtuse. <br><br>-Gordon</div>
<h2>Reply by Mark Forster</h2>
<div class="meta">2008-03-14 10:30</div>
<div class="content">Gordon:<br><br>The ideal to be aiming at is that you should keep as far on top of every active project as it is possible to be at the time.<br><br>Therefore the "next actions" for all active projects should be in your Task Diary for tomorrow. If you succeed in doing them all that day (which is what you should be aiming for) then there will be a new set of "next actions" for the following day's Task Diary.<br><br>If you don't succeed in doing them all, that's no problem. You simply carry the ones you haven't done over to the following day (you don't need to re-write them, just work off two days instead of one in the Task Diary). There will also be new "next actions" for the ones you have done.<br><br>You carry on doing this until you have caught up and have completed all the outstanding tasks. Now it's very important to note here that if your list keeps getting longer and longer each day so that you can't possibly clear it all, this is a sign that you have too much work. You then need to go through the audit procedure. I recommend that you should give yourself a time limit of 4 to 5 days, depending on the nature of your work. In other words, if you go for 4 or 5 days without finishing your Will Do list then that's a sign that you are not balancing incoming work with outgoing work.<br><br>In order to achieve this balance you have to be very careful about how many projects you have active at any one time. There is a natural tendency for work to branch out and get larger and larger. You have to ensure that your focus is maintained and not dispersed. The DIT procedure, if done correctly, enables you to do this.</div>

<div class="meta">2008-03-14 16:23</div>
<div class="content">Very Good! Thanks for the clarification Mark, it is much appreciated. <br><br>I can see that one skill I have to improve is that of breaking down my work into daily-sized "chunks" rather than just actions, and making their size intentional, rather than just starting with a next action and working on something until my next interruption. This will allow a feeling of progress and accomplishment while moving several projects forward at once.<br><br>I can also see that I need to think more carefully about what is "active". Rather than just adding what is incoming to a Projects list and producing a next action from that, I need to be more conscious about it. While "next actions" facilitate concentrated focus on a smaller scale, an open-ended project list may diffuse my focus in terms of the bigger picture and the longer term. <br><br>Given the nature of my work, I still need a holding area for things that must be done but not today (or even this week). However, being more selective about what my current project focus(es) are, may provide quicker progress, though I will often need to recur to them later with updates. I think your approach will having me working on fewer things at once but completing the total in a sequence, whereas GTD would have me completing the same projects more incrementally and stretching them all out together over a longer period. <br><br>Now that I understand DIT somewhat better (thanks!) I am going to have to give it a good go. It seems that GTD may get things off my mind, and move things forward, but that DIT may perhaps produce a greater sense of accomplishment or being "on top of" my current work as a whole. <br><br>The "projects" issue is critical though. I think it is a mental construct that people naturally gravitate toward and work with in their daily life. While I realize DIT is not a "project management system" your efforts to address and clarify how it relates to my smaller work and personal "projects" is invaluable and very much appreciated.<br><br>Sincere Thanks,<br>- Gordon</div>
