<div class="content">Hi Mark, I finally was able to acquire a copy of the Dreams book and am about halfway through it--my question is, are you still following these principles?  Have you made any modifications, if so?  There isn't much dialogue on here about this book, so I'm curious as to where the methodology stands at present.</div>

<div class="content">TK:<br><br>The short answer is no. I'm concentrating on Autofocus at the moment which doesn't really combine well with the principles in "Dreams".</div>

<div class="content">Interesting, thanks for the response.  I know you often tinker with systems and try new ones, I'm curious as to whether you found this to be a "good" system or a "failed system"--I know that based on your previous commentary, it seems like you feared that if not applied right, Dreams could lead to some drifting.  <br><br>Obviously, two books removed, you felt there was something wrong with people relying upon Dreams book alone perhaps?  Or is that reading too much into it?</div>
