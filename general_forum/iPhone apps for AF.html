<div class="content">I came across a review of  iPhone apps for Autofocus.  The author favours one called Taskpaper.  Is anyone using it - any comments to add?<br><br><a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?Using-Taskpaper-for-Autofocus-System---iPhone-App-Review&id=5042853" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://ezinearticles.com/?Using-Taskpaper-for-Autofocus-System---iPhone-App-Review&id=5042853</a><br><br>If that url is too long, try this one:<br><br><a href="http://tinyurl.com/345tc36" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/345tc36</a><br><br>acedia xx</div>

<div class="content">Searching this forum, nobody seemed to be using it with AF4, not sure why.  It was popular with the initial AF1 version.<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/661953" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/661953</a></div>

<div class="content">Thanks for doing the search, Alan!<br><br>The version of AF referred to in the app review seems to be AF4 - in fact it sounds like TaskPaper is actually better suited to AF4 than it was to AF1, as there is no longer any need for page-breaks.<br><br>I love paper except when my list gets out of date and I need to rewrite it; or when I have an emergency and need to find everything relating to a particular project / person / deadline in a short space of time.  Then digital would be better.  But most of the digital options have too many non-AF features. One is forced either to work around them or to ignore them.  Ridiculous as it sounds, I find that quite stressful - which drives me back to the simplicity of paper again.<br><br>So I think I may give TaskPaper a go.  Still interested to hear from anyone who has used it, recently or not.<br><br>acedia xx</div>

<div class="content">I'm using Toodledo in the cloud and on my iPad for my DWM implementation, and I quite like it.  I especially like being able to add tasks via Twitter.</div>

<div class="content">Acedia,<br>FocusPad was developed with AF (any version) in mind  and has a simple uncluttered interface. I've been a satisfied customer for many months. See website <a href="http://app.focuspad.ws/." target="new" rel="nofollow">http://app.focuspad.ws/.</a> Good luck <br>Jane</div>

<div class="content">PS <br>In fact this is the better link - the other site is mainly about the web sync function. <br><a href="http://7actionsdev.com/focuspad/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://7actionsdev.com/focuspad/</a><br>Jane</div>

<div class="content">I'm using TaskPaper Mac/Touch with AF4 very successfully in a combination together with "The Power of Less" and "Zen to Done" of Leo Babauta.<br><br>The review mentioned by acedia states amongst others: ... Taskpaper does not support one principle of Autofocus that when you do not finish a task in the closed list you cross it out but newly add it into the open list. I solve this problem with a simple drag and drop of the unfinished item from the closed list to the open list.<br><br>I have a comment in this respect: It's just easier to "move" the task to the same list, which results in moving the item to the end of said list. No need to d&d, which could be a little bit tedious, if the list is (very) long ... :)<br><br>TaskPaper is really worth to be looked at, if you like to simplify your task management. Development is moving towards Dropbox support and the application(s) have a very powerful query language for filtering. In connection with TextExpander a winning team!<br><br>Just my 0.02</div>
