<div class="content">A new version of AF deserves a new thread. <br><br>Because I find my lists unruly with @done items amongst my need-to-be-done items, I achieve my done tasks. With the @done tasks archived, I can no longer dismiss items as per the AF 2 rules. So I modified the following rule:<br><br>"draw a line after the first block of unactioned tasks"<br><br>to<br><br>"draw a line before the last 4 unactioned tasks". <br><br>I find this works well for the following reasons:<br><br>1) the rule is simple to follow<br>2) the spirit of dismissing in AF 2 remains<br>3) the overall list is tidy<br>4) no risk of dismissing only one item per day (there's always the threat of dismissing a max of 4 items per day)<br>5) Archiving tasks provides a snapshot of what I did during the week</div>

<div class="content">In the theme I use, the @done items are in red, the rest are white (on black background) so it is not too bad.  Do you know you can create a new view (under the Window menu) and do a search of "not @done" and you will see just your pristine list in a new tab?  You can keep the full list in one tab and use it when you look at it in the morning and in order to know where to put the line each day, but use the simple (not @done tab) list for your work throughout the day.</div>
