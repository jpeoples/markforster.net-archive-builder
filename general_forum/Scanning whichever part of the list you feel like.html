<div class="content">Is there a name for scanning whichever part of a long list you feel like, as opposed to following an algorithm like simple scanning or FVP? I guess my thinking is: if we're relying on intuition to select tasks, perhaps we can also rely on intuition for where to look? Has anyone tried this, either intentionally or unintentionally? How has it worked for you?</div>

<div class="content">I've always scanned my long lists (usually SS) in any way I feel like (starting on the last page for most active items, can go backwards or forwards etc). Since the appeal of SS for me was its sense of freedom, it seemed natural to push this freedom all the way.</div>

<div class="content">Yes, back when I did Simple Scanning, I often took a liberal approach--jumping between tasks and skipping around to different parts of the list. <br><br>I mentioned this in a recent thread and Mark replied with his perspective.<br><br><a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2787310#post2787407" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2787310#post2787407</a></div>
