<div class="content">Can any clarify how to re-enter worked on tasks in DWM?  Is it just once +7 days, or each time you work on the task (possibly multiple times a week from now)?  AF has no end so I can keep adding.  A planner has limited space per day.<br><br>Do you cross things off each time like AF, or only when complete?</div>

<div class="content">Every time you work on an item, it gets re-entered on today+7.  I suspect this is why Mark suggested a notebook large enough for three columns.</div>

<div class="content">It works like AF.  Every time you work on it, you cross it off and put it at the end of the today+7 list.  Yes, you might do that multiple times on the same task on the same day.  Yes, you might run out of space.  You can either split the page into columns to get more space; or just spill over onto the next day; or go electronic.</div>
