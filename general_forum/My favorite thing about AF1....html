<div class="content">My favorite thing about AF1 is that it totally rocks!<br><br>And it's so simple, no one would believe it. I love things that are disarmingly simple and universally underestimated, untapped power hiding in plain sight.</div>

<div class="content">My favorite thing about AF1 is the Common-Sense Rule:  If something needs doing immediately, just do it! (With apologies to Nike.) This rule, used liberally, reminds us all that AF1 and other such systems are meant to help us, not put us in a straightjacket. <br><br>For example, if you're having a crazy day, something that might need doing now is a new task such as "Scan the end of the AF list and put the five urgent things that are about to blow up on a side list to be worked today, and put the AF notebook away to pick up again tomorrow, when sanity is restored."</div>
