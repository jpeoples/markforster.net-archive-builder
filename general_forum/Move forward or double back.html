<div class="content">I am only about a week into use of AF and am confused about two issues.  When you pick up your AF book, do you usually/always go back to your first active page, or just continue on from the page you most recently worked on?<br>Secondly, I have found that if, when a new project comes to mind, if I enter a lot of tasks related to that project at the end of my list, it really bogs the system down for me, especially if the tasks are dependent on one another. Is it a better practice to only list the project, a single task for the project, or multiple tasks as I have been doing and just keep cycling back to that page. <br>Thanks in advance for your insights. <br></div>

<div class="content">You always start on the page where you left. <br><br>For projects: It's better not to overload a page with too many tasks for one project, that's right. I keep everything regarding a certain project – ideas, information bites, anything – separate, as notes (on pages in my notebook that are NOT part of the AF list). <br><br>And actually, most projects are not THAT difficult... You just have one entry and develop your course as you go.</div>

<div class="content">RE entering all the project tasks, or just the main project itself.  I do a little of both, but lean toward entering the main project itself into AF, and keeping the project details in an Outlook folder or something like that.<br><br>Try it both ways (or several different ways) and see what works best.  But while doing that kind of experimentation, I've found that entering LESS into AF usually works better.  If that's not working, start adding more detail to AF.  Stop adding detail when it starts working for you.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Alan,<br>For the record, I've "dumped" into my AF book a lot and I regret doing it very much. If you have found that you've done this and it's bogging you down, just dismiss a bunch of the tasks (for now) and put a task down at the end of your book to review your dismissed items.  <br>I don't keep separate project files with tasks listed out there, but am trying to make a diligent effort to only put in the next possible step, not the next 20 steps.  Even if they're not dependent, it can bog you down, there's probably a happy medium somewhere.  Good luck!<br></div>

<div class="content">With projects, I tend to enter any task that has no pre-requisites.  If there is only one task I can do, then I just enter that, sometimes with some sort of abbreviation to suggest to myself i need to enter the next task when I have completed that.  <br><br>If you find you are entering 20 tasks to do with one thing, maybe you need to have another place where you leave your project brainstorming.  I have an evernote notebook for my project material and I add any maybe ideas to that, and only my definite, I want to work on this tasks to my AF lists.  Of course, AF then teaches me which of those tasks I truely wanted to do.</div>
