<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>You indicate that with reaccuring tasks you should do them at the same time every day. You also, reccommend doing the urgent (must be done by today) as soon as you can. So my question is, If I'm working on a same day urgent task and it's also time to do my reaccuring task, which do I do. I can see advantages to both.<br><br>Thanks</div>

<div class="content">Dear Bill and Mark<br><br>The problem with reoccurring tasks is that they aren't urgent. Therefore they need protecting by giving them their own "sacred time".Otherwise they tend to get pushed aside by things which are seen as more urgent.<br><br>So my answer to your question is that you should give the reoccurring task the same priority as you would give an important meeting, i.e. during it you are simply not available for other work.<br><br>Of course even with a meeting, something may come up that is so urgent that you have to cry off the meeting. But that should be a very rare happening.</div>
