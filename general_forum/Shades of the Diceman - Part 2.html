<div class="content">Hi Mark<br>Congrats on getting your taxes completed early. What a relief, yeah? When you say that you use this for everything, do you carry a smart phone for when you're doing things not in your office? I think you're giving the system credit that should go to you. I wouldn't be able to produce your stats even if a gun barrel was pressed against my temple.</div>

<div class="content">I would just like to say that I was very skeptical of this concept the first few times I looked over the previous thread -- I just laughed it off dismissively and moved on.  But yesterday I decided to try it, and I am surprised how effective it has proven to be.  I have tried both the list method (starting with two) and the number + notebook method, and both have surprised me and their ability to get me moving without resistance.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Austin<br>I know you didn't mean anything by it, but when you stated<br><br>" I just laughed it off dismissively and moved on."<br><br>my heart quivered.  My different brain caused me lots of trouble since I was a child.  It also helped me tremulously when I wasn't bored or feeling too much resistance.  I just had to suffer through agonizing amounts of restlessness to complete the boring stuff.  When my brain happened to hyperfocus, I'd ride the wave and produce sometimes incredible results.  I never deserved either the derision nor the credit. My brain was just different.  I was segregated from my classmates yet always asked to be in the competitions.  I LOVED college because all they cared about was results, not how my quirky brain got me there.<br><br>I truly believe that me life would have been FAR easier and FAR less embarrassing if I had learned Mark's tricks decades ago.<br><br>To be fair, the derision and exclusion contributed to me making sure that I always excelled and mostly won.  Many times I didn't give a crap about the subject, the talent or the sport.  It was my way of spitting in their face!  LOL!  Of course, I didn't let them know how agonizing it was to get past the boredom.  I felt graced when I was actually interested.  That's when hyperfocus carried me.  LOL!<br><br>Thank you, Mark, many many times over!  I can't possibly properly express the magnitude and impact of your generous help.   I know I'm not the only one. <br><br>I'd like to also thank Mark's guests.  I've learned that there is no one correct method or principle.  I've received so much knowledge and workarounds from you guys. You all are so intelligent and engaging.<br><br>It all started with Mark referring me to "It's Like Walking Across a Muddy Field: how to get rid of backlogs" which led me to DIT.<br><br><a href="../blog/It’s Like Walking Across a Muddy Field how to get rid of backlogs.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2008/7/28/its-like-walking-across-a-muddy-field-how-to-get-rid-of-back.html</a></div>

I'm using the system I described in the first part of this thread, initially on January 15th with an important amendment the following day. <br><br>After using it for four days, it's so far proved to be the best system I have ever tried. <br><br>Here's my stats at the end of today:<br><br>Page 1 - 0 tasks remaining out of 32<br>Page 2 - 0 <br>Page 3 - 0<br>Page 4 - 0<br>Page 5 - 0<br>Page 6 - 3<br>Page 7 - 6<br>Page 8 - 6<br>Page 9 - 18<br>Page 10 - 17<br>Page 11 - 27<br>Page 12 - 15 (out of 15)<br><br>Total tasks outstanding: 86. This is one less than yesterday so the list continues to remain stable in size.<br><br>I must write a proper blog post about it because it's too difficult to find instructions when they are hidden away in a mass of forum comments. It won't be tomorrow though, as I'm away all day.</div>

<div class="content">Wow, best system I've ever used (number + notebook method).  When you hit a task that you can't do (do such and such and errand when the stores are closed), do you rewrite it and randomize again, ignore it, or move to the next open task?</div>

<div class="content">This method is so unbelievably addictive.  I can't wait to see what task I get!  So far it has completely eliminated resistance.  I use an app called "Randomness" on my Mac to generate a random number.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark<br><br>Hi Mark<br>I look forward to the blog post.<br><br>I thought I understood both the slide principle (to increase probability of numbers hitting by counting crossed off tasks) and I thought I understood to wrap around only on page one. Other pages you move forward.  Is that right?<br><br>You said:<br><br>"I just missed clearing all four tasks off page 1. I threw a 27 from the last page which took me to line 22 on the first page, from where I slid to line 1. "<br><br>Understood the slide to 1.<br><br>"Then 5 came up and I slid to line 9"<br><br>Yup…<br><br>"I then threw a 2 and slid all around the page to line 2."<br><br>Yup.. <br><br>"Only two numbers (31 and 32) would have prevented me from hitting line 5, the only unactioned line left. Of course I threw 31 which took me off the page."<br><br>Here's where you lost me. <br>Why didn't it just slide back around to 5?  What different rule had you go to a different page yet you slid around into 1,9 and then 2.  Why not for 5?<br><br>If my work slows down enough, I might play around with this.  It has to fit my DIT.  I won't screw around with what's served me so well all of these years.  Would your system also work with a 3 to 7 item list?  Maybe I can play with this after my MIT and CI is done.  Hmmm....<br><br>I'm so glad that you're enjoying yourself!</div>

<div class="content">Learning:<br><br>When you generate a random number, you MOVE FORWARD forward that many tasks.   If you go beyond the bottom of the page, then you continue counting tasks on the NEXT page.   There is no "sliding" at this point.<br><br>When you land on a task, if that task is already crossed off, THEN the sliding rule goes into effect, and you slide to the next unfinished task.   It's only when sliding that you circle back up to the top of the page.<br><br>Mark has 32 tasks per page, and was on Task #2 of his current page.   The only other task remaining was Task #5.   Thus, if he rolled anything 1 thru 30, he would land somewhere on the current page - and then slide around the page till he hit task #5, thus giving him the opportunity to finish task #5.   But if he rolled 31 or 32, this would take him to task #1 or task #2 of the NEXT page - thus leaving task #5 of the current page to wait till next time around.<br><br>I hope that helps clarify it, though I suspect Mark could explain in in 1/5th as many words!</div>

<div class="meta">2014-01-19 6:56</div>
<div class="content">Another way to implement the sliding rule so that you have a chance of hitting Task #1 on Page #1 would be to move BACKWARDS through the list.   This would remove the need for the slide / cycle through current page rule.  If you land on a crossed-out task, you'd just keep sliding backwards (even across page breaks) till you hit an unfinished task.<br><br>I've always hated moving backwards through lists, though -- it just seems unnatural!</div>

<div class="content">Hi all,<br><br>I tried this all day yesterday (Saturday) using a notebook and it was a wonderfully productive day. The randomness removes bias and a few items that have bugged me for a while got moved on or cleared. This could be the novelty of a new system of course, but hey, if it is then I got a good day out of it. I'm working the same way today, Sunday.<br><br>One thing I noticed yesterday is it made me more ruthless evaluating current tasks. As Mark said, if a task cannot be done for valid, logistical reasons I have crossed it off and re-written it. But, there are a lot of tasks on my list that have hung around under the  various AF versions I have been using. With AF I have been free to not select them, and keep them on the list in hope. With random selection I am confronted by the fact that they will continue to be selected and I have to either accept I need to work on them, or accept that they are not for me right now and cross them off. It's the easiest, most ruthless dismissal I've experienced yet, albeit with only one day's experience.<br><br>Matt</div>

<div class="content">I've been doing this for a couple of days and so many difficult and resistant tasks have been dealt with, mainly by just getting on and doing them. Brilliant! Extremely productive. Long may it last.<br><br>Thanks again, Mark (I'm going to get a t-shirt with that on it).<br><br>One question: when you clear a page, do you start counting from the last task cleared on that page, or from the top of the next open page?</div>

<div class="content">I wish I had been using this system years ago, it is amazing.  However, I have encountered a glitch.  At this moment I have some very heavy reading to do by tomorrow, and if I don't focus on that for the next several hours, it's not going to get done. Naturally, I just put my random list aside and I'm going to town on the reading. My thinking is that had I been using this system a week ago, this "logjam" for lack of a better word, wouldn't have happened.  I feel the longer I use this system, the more evenly my attention will be spread across all my tasks, and the less likely I'll be facing one of these logjams in the future.  I'm hoping, anyway.  One thing for sure, when I use this random system, all resistance has melted away.  In fact, I can't wait to see what task I roll next.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Paul<br><br>I think it's so cool when Mark creates systems to help people especially when there's a gamification element.  I'm glad that it's proving successful for you.<br><br>I stick with my old ways usually.  I only use the randomizing method to break out of stalemate/high resistance.  Even then, I prime the deck to favor getting my CI and MIT's started for the first round. I never add tasks unless I finish drawing all the cards before the time block has ended which hasn't happened yet in all these years.  Adding tasks diminishes the probabilities ratio of every task so I prefer diminishing the possible draws using a discard arch.  When you use a demising pool of possible draws, it lowers the category that you chose…but…you have just worked on it!  It increases the other categories.<br>Example:  CI  -4 cards<br>                   MIT 1 - 2 cards<br>                   MIT 2 - 2 cards<br>                   Wild card  1 or 2 cards<br>If I'm hell bent on completing a job that I just drew, I'll not discard it.  That way, the odds stay the same for the next draw rather than decrease.  Because I only use this to break out of stalemate, I don't do this very often.  My way I have 80% or greater chance of drawing an MIT.  The wild card serves the purpose of diffusing anxiety by allowing in hope and optimism that I have a CHANCE of doing something less onerous once in a while!  LOL!  Wild card means my choice!  LOL!  <br><br>Once I've broken down the stalemate, I go back to my list.  It's faster that way.  BTW, my list is only my CI and MITs.  I bundle or pick at the recurring or one off stuff and use it as a relief valve so that I can keep working rather than burn out from all the high concentration work.  <br><br>My goal is to work toward a state of peace by breaking down the overwhelm and doing enough for today/this week/meet deadlines, etc.   This does the trick every time I need to break out of stalemate/overwhelm.  There has been times when I've been particularly stubborn where I had to do this for several hours!  LOL!<br><br>Maybe Mark's big list randomization method might be a fun way to pick off the recurring and one offs. I'm definitely curious to try that.   If I didn't love my DIT so much, I'd probably try it for my entire list but I don't want to switch horses when Mark has already put me on a winning horse with my modified DIT. LOL!  <br><br>Hmmmm….I'm getting curiouser and curiouser….</div>

Another way again of saying a similar thing might be that if I add a task to the list I may actually have to work on it! The random selection is much more unforgiving than I am.<br><br>Having played with this at home over the weekend I am now using it at work, where some things are more deadline driven. This means I have broken out the calendar and scheduled some work this morning to make sure it is finished on time. It's actually quite nice because I was writing time-dependent tasks on the AF list and then hunting them out. Now I have the 'hard-edged' stuff scheduled and I am gazing lovingly at an empty afternoon in the calendar where I can dive into the random-selection list and just try and get into the flow.<br><br>Matt</div>

Congrats!<br><br>To be frank, no system would work for me if I didn't have an arsenal of workarounds to jump start my attitude.

Unfortunately, I'm not always rewarded with an empty afternoon to gaze at.  Sometimes when that happens, I become the hare and just goof off instead of worrying about the bundled recurring and one offs.  I'm learning how to feel less guilty using my lower pain times toward enjoying my life rather than always being the steadfast and dutiful tortoise.  Why can't I realize more often that sometimes relaxation and pleasure are the real MITs?  Puritan work ethic?  BAH!</div>

<div class="content">Hi learning; re:  <<relaxation and pleasure are the real MITs>><br><br>This is a recurring issue for me, hence my most recent post on 2 list AF - the "have to do" list and the "fun and pleasure" list.<br><br>I noticed that most things on my AF list were imposed things from duty and obligation; so in that sense AF revealed to me my own attitudes and convictions. Then I took some ideas from <a href="http://peterjonesauthor.com/books/how-to-do-everything-and-be-happy/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://peterjonesauthor.com/books/how-to-do-everything-and-be-happy/</a> and created additional lists. Peter Jones suggests 3 ideas that took my fancy:<br><br>1. have a bucket list, but don't call it a bucket list; don't wait butregard it as a experiences to seek out now<br><br>2. have a "Boxing Day" attitude set aside for the 26th of each month, not just Xmas<br><br>3. also, have a "goals day" where you specific about working only on goals<br><br>So far I use my "fun list" to create more balance between work and play.

<div class="content">Michael<br>I don't spend a lick of time on things I don't value. Sometimes uphold my values means completing boring stuff, dealing with rules and people who aggravate me, etc.  That's far better than not doing it.  No amount of lousy work feels nearly as bad as going against what or who I value or willfully choosing to be a lesser version of who I am.  I gripe because I don't always like the experience of meeting my responsibilities.  Never once have I griped that I chose to see it through.  Meeting my responsibilities and upholding my values frees up my creativity and passion. It also enhances my confidence and courage in my possible future.  <br><br>For life to be truly sweet and hopeful, you do both.  As Clint Eastwood says "There are no free rides."</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>Read Mark's DIT. The overriding principle is commitment vs interest.  Mark has a wealth of articles that are enlightening.  Even clever use of structured procrastination is toward the good of it's not carelessly applied.  What I love most about Mark's work is that he provides us with customizable systems and immutable principles.  He even offers many ways to stick with your plan and many ways to get back on track when we veer off.

The other day I went for a random walk, in that every time I came to a junction I used the randomizer on my phone to choose which way to go. I just went round in circles. To achieve anything, randomness needs to be operating within the right frame, and that has to be designed by someone.<br><br>In "The Diceman" Luke Rhinehart constructed a framework which basically allowed him to let go of all restraints and act in an immoral and irresponsible way.

<div class="content">Hi Mel<br>You're too kind. <br><br>For some reason I started to feel embarrassed about all of my misspellings, omitted words, incomplete sentences, etc.  (Sometimes reading back what I typed in 10 minutes can take over an hour to proof read so I just cross my fingers and click my heels.  LOL)  I find that the auto-correct feature's propensity for spitting out totally left field words is FAR more embarrassing and confusing than leaving my usual crappy writing as it is.  LOL! I sincerely don't understand how you find me inspiring.  I take forever to do what you guys do in no time and I make many, many more embarrassing errors.  My social ego was shot to hell years ago!  LOL!<br><br>Wishing you and yours an exceptionally wonderful 2014!</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>Mel<br>Don' allow resistance to what you draw serve as any real deterrent.  That's the reason we need the randomizer in the first place.  What the randomizer does is to REDUCE my brain's  focusing on resistance to particular work.  It's similar to dreading getting that colonoscopy. The dread will haunt you every day until you finally get it over with.  No matter how embarrassed you are while it's happening, it's only for a limited time.  The randomizer does the same thing.  I choose an MIT that I dread, it's not pink ponies and rainbows.  I think "Oh, GEEZ!  I have to start THIS crap?"  The beauty part is that like the colonoscopy, the negative feelings are restricted to the time that you're actually doing it.  The wild card(s) had a bit of hope that makes me willing to approach the game.  If there was no wild card, I'd probably blow the whole thing off.  Bear in mind, this circuitous route is still far better than not doing the work at all, yeah?  When we  need to use crutches we don't expect to go dancing.  We're just doing the best that we can with what we are at that time.  At least we tried our best to do the right thing. (at least this is what I tell myself rather than make myself feel like a total loser.  You're not a total loser if you stay in the game. LOL!)  I once did about a 1/10 of a mile on my hands and knees while running a marathon.  It totally screwed my time and embarrassed the hell out of me but I did clock in at the FINISH line.  This is no different.  LOL!</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>Hi Mel<br>I wasn't clear.  I did not crawl over the finish line.  This happened at about mile 23.  Luckily, my legs came back and I stopped feeling like I was going to pass out. I don't know the exact amount of time I had to do that but luckily my stubbornness was a bit stronger than my depleted ego.  *blush*  Luckier still, I caught a second wind and I was upright for the rest of the race.  It felt like God kissed me on the forehead.  My time sucked but at least I was upright when the cameras were flashing.  LOL!  The abrasions scabbed over and a few people asked if it was road rash!

<div class="content">Mark, thanks for the clarification. It makes a lot more sense to know that it's not completely random. I'm still not 100% sure of the rules you're using, but I'm hopeful you'll be explaining in your blog post. <br><br>Learning, you are so bright, tenacious, humble, and funny.

<div class="content">I've always been inspired by the fact that perfect randomness at the micro level (for example, air molecules doing the Brownian dance inside a balloon) generates perfect balance, order, and predictability at the macro level (uniform pressure and temperature inside the balloon).  <br><br>In fact, if there were any non-random motion at the molecular level, it would result in distortions and unpredictable behavior at the macro level.<br><br>Thus, order seems to be an emergent property of randomness.

<div class="content">Hi All,<br><br>Some rambling thoughts inspired by this thread...<br><br>Learning, I love this:<br><br>"No amount of lousy work feels nearly as bad as going against what or who I value or willfully choosing to be a lesser version of who I am."<br><br>I’m currently reading (re-reading) Steven Pressfield's The War of Art, which is basically about being guided by Resistance and overcoming it to move forward creatively. Sound familiar? I always loved Mark's concept of the Resistance Principle. I had trouble applying it because it’s so easy to fool myself about what is really the best thing to do next. It all comes down to craving everything coming easily to me, when in reality the valuable stuff often takes rolling up the sleeves and working hard, which I then resist (which takes me full circle to Learning’s inspiring quote above).<br><br>I think it was Mark in ‘Get Everything Done...’ who pointed out that in order to go with the flow a river needs banks that direct that flow, otherwise it becomes a stagnant pool. Extending that metaphor further, a river isn’t always calm. Sometimes it has to fight over rocks, gets backed up, and even has to turn back on itself and find another way in order to maintain the flow. In other words, a good life sometimes takes hard work.<br><br>Mark’s earlier post, including the comment “If you don't frame the randomness properly it will be useless” seems to me to bring together the Resistance Principle with this current randomisation method.<br><br>The method holds the promise of allowing flow through the reduced resistance some of us are reporting. It also hints it will provide the river bank as tasks added to the list are actually going to come up and can’t be easily or subconsciously avoided, so they need to be real, relevant tasks.<br><br>End of ramble :)<br><br>Matt</div>

The simplest way to do this is to generate a random "angle" between 0 and 360 and then use a protractor to draw a random line on a physical map from your starting point. This page (<a href="http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html)" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html)</a> will let you input co-ordinates and an angle and will return a Google map with the angle (partway down the page under "Bearing"). It will feel more satisfying to walk to a destination rather than just randomly walking around. I always thought it would be interesting to fully explore an area in a year by walking for an hour each day on every possible angle from my apartment (eg 360 degrees in 365 days is very close to 1 degree a day -- each day just tick the angle up by 1).<br><br>As an aside, I have to say though that in the early days of AF1 (still my favourite method BTW), I used the "standing out" method to randomly walk around my neighbourhood. Come to an intersection, glance at the 3 options, and then look at them again and take the route that "stands out". Worked quite well. Still comes out a bit circular but you generally end up in the place you intuitively wanted to be.<br><br>Another implementation of randomness I have quite enjoyed recently is random bookmarks (https://addons.mozilla.org/EN-US/firefox/addon/random-bookmark/). Whenever I have a few minutes of downtime I always end up looking at the same websites. I also have hundreds of bookmarks over the years which I never get around to look at or organize. This add-on is a little button at the top of the browser which randomly selects a bookmark and opens the page. Very nifty.</div>

And you'll think I'm being "arrogant" or some such for asking.  It is not the random selector which is doing the tasks, it's you who is doing the tasks.  The random selector is picking the task for you to do.  Okay, I get that this removes your biases, you've outsourced your task selection to a neutral third-party.  Is that really enough to eliminate almost all resistance?  Why?<br><br>Is it much more of a leap to simply just pick a task and DO it without the selector, based on being ever-mindful that it needs doing, using the knowledge that it will be done and out of the way as the driver instead?  That's the approach I described a while back and it is very productive, but it's productive because I'm doing everything, not because I'm using a random selector.<br><br>Why does the random selector hold such power to make you DO a task, since all it can actually do is select a task?  It's a genuine question.  Why does outsourcing task selection to a neutral third-party massively reduce the resistance to tasks such that you can now do them, but selecting them manually means they get skipped over, given that you still know they are there and are not going to go away?</div>

<div class="content">Mel,<br><br>One option to resistance, _which needs to be used with care_, is to ask questions, then maybe mark it "resisted" and roll again. Ask why you're resisting it, and do one of the usual 4Ds (do, delegate, defer, dismiss).<br><br>There are dozens of valid reasons why we might be resisting, and as those "resisted, didn't do" marks pile up, you'll start digging deeper into why you are resisting it (or you'll finally deal with it).<br><br>Maybe allow yourself one "resist" per day (or per 4 hours of work, or...) You might decide it's better to do the task than to use up your resist.<br><br>If all tasks are equal (which in this case they aren't), it's ok to ignore the die's advice. I often find that when I flip a coin in the food court I realize I actually do have preference, and it's not for the one the coin chose. In that case, the coin helped me make a decision, even though I didn't take its advice.<br><br>For the task list, though, all tasks are not equal. The one chosen by the die will allow the system to work for you, and, as has been shown, help clear out old tasks.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark<br>For some reason I woke up thinking about your quote to Melanie.<br><br>"randomness without intelligence leads nowhere."<br><br>I took a meteorology class.  Differential calculus taught me that, in fact, weather isn't really random.  It always follows the rules.  What makes it sometimes difficult to predict is that the various causal agents can change exponentially which make it impossible to nail down the various and ever changing probability ratios.<br><br>Even though I was only about 14-15 years old when I took the class, it matured my expectations about life itself.  It also reminded me about Dad playing poker.  You act on information as it becomes available yet you also factor in the many possible unknowns.  <br><br>Maybe thats why I prime the deck.  It makes me feel less vulnerable to all of those unknowns. Conversely, adding the wild card(s) changes my viewpoint to a willingness toward accepting what's unknown because the wild cards add a factual, possible forecast of optimism.  As I count the discarded cards, the probability of getting that wild card increases.  I realize that I can't expect to definitely draw it but I can surely hope that it does as each work card is placed in the discard rack.  Without the discard rack, my odds would never improve.  LOL!<br><br>This is a fun thread. It's also thought provoking on several planes.<br><br>Hi Gregory<br>I've heard of the The War of Art mentioned on this website but I never read it.  When I begin to have silly thoughts about abandoning my work, images of my dad patiently teaching me how to develop and integrate character traits based on my values brings me back to those days of index cards and filling in my calendar.  He made  my choosing something as basic as "feed the rabbit" feel profoundly wise and important because it was reinforcing compassion which is the highest value of all.  Maybe I've never quite grown out of basking in the glow of my hero's approval.   LOL!  It's amazing to realize what informs our decisions. I thought I was being high-minded yet I was just a snot-nosed kid trying to make my dad proud of me.  LOL!</div>

<div class="content">Learning, for me this is the most profound statement in this thread:<br><br>"He made my choosing something as basic as "feed the rabbit" feel profoundly wise and important because it was reinforcing compassion which is the highest value of all."<br><br>I suspect that much of the resistance we all experience is because the task has become disconnected from our values. Getting an oil change isn't taking care of a huge blessing (your car) that millions of people don't have and exercising responsibility (a value). It's just a pain in the rear. <br><br>If that's the case, how do we better connect our tasks to our values? I have tried writing down why I'm doing things and it's not been that useful for me. Perhaps it's more of an intentional change of attitude--a reframing of what we do to make it sound more like a politician's rhetoric. <br><br>I'm really inspired to get to work now, raising up future leaders, creating a place where family members and guests feel safe and loved, and motivating others to change their lives. That sounds so much better than getting the kids moving on their homework, cleaning the basement, and writing an ebook, doesn't it? ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mel<br><br>I suppose your respect for politicians is far greater than mine.  If my self talk started sounding like that, I'd probably begin to distrust and despise myself.  There's nothing disingenuous about actively re-framing your thoughts to remind yourself of things that need more focus.  i've stated before that I have to remind myself of the WHY I'm bothering to do something that's relatively unpleasant, fearsome or outright anxiety provoking.  It always goes back to what was written on those index cards.  LOL!<br><br>Another game I play is relative gratitude.  If I'm experiencing pain and start feeling put out about what the car wreck did to me, I think about myself in a wheel chair with a catheter stuck up my X. Then I begin to actually feel a bit grateful for my circumstances.  The pain I'm withstanding feels like a dance in the park compared to being jailed in a wheelchair.  Now if I was in a wheelchair, I probably think "at least I can see."  I remember my dad going in for surgery that he had to pay cash up front for because the insurance company wouldn't pay for it because his odds were so dire.  Before they put him on the gurney he told me "I can stand almost any outcome even death but I couldn't stand becoming blind."  Unfortunately, he did lose most of his vision and had to suffer mirages of things that weren't actually there.  I was truly frightened for him.  I asked him what he thought about what happened.  He told me that part of the reason he became an ophthalmologist was his fear of blindness.  Now that he was living it, it was actually doable.  <br><br>Most of the time we can just prioritize our list and do what we're supposed to do.  Other times dread or fear can create a paralyzing cognitive dissonance.  The tsunami of irrational dread can actually stalemate us. Of course it's irrational but none the less we are gripped in it's clutches.   We simultaneously want to approach that job yet feel agonizing resistance.  Many times we can play with our heads to bring into focus why we've decided to do that job that creates so much irrational dread.  We're just adjusting the lens to correct the distorted thinking.  But, alas, that doesn't always work for me.  When I'm genuinely stalemated, I grab the cards.  The dread is still there but it's not the only focus.  There are other a couple of other important jobs to choose and the wild card.  Maybe it's the Irish in me but I enjoy a game of chance especially where I can't lose!  LOL!  Sometimes it only takes one or two draws to break the stalemate.  Then I just go back to my list.  Other times it may take hours.  No matter.  The work is still getting done: irrational thoughts and all.  LOL!  <br><br>Mel, I like that you play the same game as I do.  When you play the mind game,scraping the crud off of the dishes suddenly feels like you're honoring the blessing of breaking bread with those you love.  LOL!  Another thing that it does is when you next have to do it, your memory bank has those wonderful feelings impacting and informing your thoughts.  It's win-win.  Whatever gets us over the hump, yeah?</div>

I don't claim any of them give a complete answer.<br><br>1. It's still me in control. I've constructed the rules. I've decided what tasks should be on the list. I can amend the rules if they don't work. I can decide to do a task that needs doing whatever the rules say. All I've done is delegate the selection of the next task to the randomizer.<br><br>2. Decisions use a lot of mental resources. A soldier in the Army who is following orders may be using a lot of physical resources, but it's much harder being an officer who has to make crucial decisions as well. (I know, I've been in both positions). This sort of mental strain is removed if you don't have to make the decisions. Imagine an Army commander had a randomizer so when he made contact with the enemy he could select "Do a frontal attack", "Attack on the left flank", "Attack on the right flank", "Withdraw", "Stay where we are". The strain of having to make the "right" decision would be removed. Of course an Army commander would never do that because of the horrific consequences of making the wrong decision. And yet using a randomizer might sometimes be the right decision because it would make one's actions unpredictable to the enemy.<br><br>3. To return to the world of normal office working, It's not so much DOING the tasks that is the problem but STARTING them. One's resistance to a particular task means that one is less likely to start it. The randomizer presents a simple method of overcoming one's start bias against particular tasks. <br><br>4. It also overcomes one's start bias *towards* particular tasks. We tend to follow the same mental paths that we have trodden before and it's easy to get into a routine of doing certain tasks which virtually excludes tasks which are not part of the routine. <br><br>5. And I think there's another important element involved. It's fun not knowing what you are going to be doing next and there's a real sense of anticipation as you press the button and the number comes up and then you count forward in your list.</div>

<div class="content"><<Why does the random selector hold such power to make you DO a task, since all it can actually do is select a task?>><br><br>I think "decision fatigue" phenomenon, which is studied by many psychologists, will at least partially answer this question =you conserve a lot of "mental" energy, when you do not have to decide, even among enjoyable tasks. You can thus focus such conserved energy on doing task. Also, you do not have to consider "opportunity costs" (comparing benefits of other possible tasks over chosen task) - rumination which also drains lot of your energy...</div>

I sometimes feel a mix of surprise and dismay when I draw a task that I've been avoiding. But instead of fighting resistance to start work on it, I just accept that this is what I need to work on and instead use my mental/emotional resources to chunk it down, make micro-progress, set a pomodoro, etc. Anything to help me avoid using my will power!

<div class="content">Hi Cricket<br>Oh, my God, you just revealed the skeleton in my closet.  Although I try my best to stay focused in the present, I know damn well that a lot of my anger and frustration about being disabled causes me to highly resist much of whatever I do!  *blush* Whenever I have to interact with people, I FEAR that they are going to be dismissive or condescending because I'm disabled.  I can hide behind this typewriter but my disabilities are much more apparent in person.  I try not to allow people's reactions to take me aback, but, frequently it still does.  It happens frequently enough for me to almost count on it.  Before I make a call, I'll write down everything I want to communicate.  I'll also sometimes write some possible responses to their predictable blowing me off retorts.  It really feels quite demeaning.  If I didn't force myself to make the calls,  I'd never make them. LOL!  Having to do business in person?  GEEZ!  I'd rather have a tooth pulled!  LOL!<br><br>Thanks for bringing that into the open.  Overcoming the fear of social suicide (which it feels like) is definitely a strong source of my resistance.  Another huge factor is communicating with people who are apathetic vs conscientious.  It's frustrating to hear the hollow and polite non-responses which translate to getting the runaround.  Yup.  Sometimes using randomization replaces the needed confidence and maturity that I  can't always muster up on my own.  GEEZ.  I've just publicly admitted to being a damn coward...</div>

<div class="content">Another stray thought: viewing the randomizer as a whimsical solution to a technical problem that avoids moral/character considerations. <br><br>I sometimes identify too strongly with my task lists. Doing or not doing a task says something about my values or my character, and those forces may come into play with resisting/doing. ("Procrastinating on writing that email? What are you afraid of? Don't be a wimp! Just do it now and you'll feel better later. What will they think of you if you mess up?")<br><br>Instead, I think there's some value in treating the task list and task management as a technical/engineering problem divorced of my self-imposed value judgments. And the randomizer is a neat technical solution that takes "me" out of the decision-making loop. Instead of arguing with myself about whether or not to do the task, I can use my resources to instead attack the problem.<br><br>I will not use the randomizer as my task management method for all time. But it's a very fun tool to have in the kit, along with MITs, DIT, AF, one thing at a time, pomodoro, etc. And depending on my mood or the day (confounding variables at best, in all senses of that term), it may be the best tool to deploy.</div>

So many insights that make a real difference in the quality of our lives are obvious, but their applications to us aren't. <br><br>Another problem I've had is anxiety about dealing with difficult people permeating my work. I feel overwhelmed, but when I stop to think about it, I realize there isn't anything to feel overwhelmed about! I have some people that I need to "dismiss" from my list that doesn't include anyone here. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mel<br><br>I feel for you because I'm mired in a similar pool of people who are aggravating to deal with. LOL<br><br>I am now actively avoiding more calls.  I need a break and I need to stay away from any firearms.  It is so exasperating when you're trying to conduct business where they screen their calls, don't return calls, don't carry out the next step and you're stuck getting nowhere. One of my biggest peeves is when they finally do correct an error yet create an even more grave error in the process.  You have to keep your polite, patient voice going while you restrain yourself from saying "Stop lying!"  "Check for errors before making things even worse."  etc...  Last week I totally lost it and told somebody "Should?  Did I hear you say should?  I don't want to hear should.  Are they going to do it or not?  Then she says "Yes, they should have it done."  I screamed, "They should have resolved this already.  I'm tired of hearing the word should."  The person corrected herself and said "You can call them and they'll take care of it."  I hung up and called them........NOPE!  More lies and excuses.  I've been calling them since last Tuesday.  Another company keeps accidentally increasing my bill when they keep promising to give me the proper credit.  Just recently (after over a month of haggling with them) they finally cut a check for my $1,152.  Within a week, they started up messing with my bill again.  Their errors keep increasing the bill rather than honoring the fact that the credits due me put me ahead.  I've seen 5 or 6 changes to my bill in less than a month.  I totally blows my mind when they say that they fake sincerely apologize, exclaiming what an important customer I am since 1978 and the correction will post in 24 to 48 hours.  Each time, like they are intentionally being pranksters, correct the overage.  Then in the same 24-28 hours they pull a charge out of their butt and add it to the balance making the total even higher.  Below the closed list line is 1)X will call back as soon as she downloads X  and sets up Y and confirms with Z so that we can continue business.  (I resolved this last Tuesday by having the company's officials calling their office personally.  Obviously, it did no good.)  2)  Left Message re: erroneous increase on my bill after a week falsely putting me overdue on a bill that I'm actually ahead on.  Are the inept bastards going to add a late fee and interest to money I don't even owe?  Expect more crap...<br><br>Yup, I'm willfully avoiding that crap for awhile.  Forget the wildcards.  I'm choosing work that doesn't involve any immediate communication with people who are **cking me over with apathy and ineptness while thinking that I'm not aware that they're just giving me the reach around while they.... LOL!  Hmmm, what's next on my list that doesn't involve dealing with any people?<br><br>Mel, I wish you far better results than I can ever hope for!  LOL!</div>

<div class="content">Paul Macnell said<I use an app called "Randomness" on my Mac to generate a random number>.<br><br>I could only find the iPhone app for "randomness", not for the Mac. Does anyone use a Mac app and if so, a link would be most appreciated. Most random generator apps seem to be for smartphones, I couldn't find one for OSX anywhere on the web. Whilst the web app is fine to use, a  standalone app would be nice when internet access is difficult. <br><br>Like many people here, I too am finding a productivity surge, though early days yet. But because all the decision making is taken out of the process, there is a refreshing sense that whenever I do a task, my choice biases are not interfering in the process.</div>

<div class="content">I wonder if, for some of us, the randomness feels like a Higher Power (one that has our best interests in mind) is helping the selection.<br><br>If so, I'm curious if native Americans and others who have a trickster god (like Crow or Coyote, or Anansi from Africa) would feel as comfortable with this system, or if they'd add something to ensure a more helpful god stepped in. (Not that a trickster god can't be helpful, but usually it's a learning experience rather than something immediately useful.)<br><br>Learning, you aren't a coward. You're handling a demanding situation very well. I'd have broken down and given up long ago.<br><br>You are justified in avoiding (within reason) people who are trying to help but don't know how and are currently incapable of learning. I see you recognize that they believe they are trying to help. Your attorney, though, has probably worked with you long enough that he should know better. He should have your back, and be able to deal with those incompetent companies on your behalf. (Sounds like they owe you enough that he'll earn his fee.)<br><br>Give yourself as much compassion as you try to give others. Jesus said "love others as you love yourself," not "love others more than you love yourself". Buddha said we should have compassion for all sentient beings, and that includes yourself. A Catholic friend told her confessor that she just wasn't ready to receive forgiveness for hating someone (which would include moving on to not hating him). He suggested that she ask for forgiveness for not being ready to give up her hate.<br><br>++++<br><br>Back to the random method. Back in days of FV, I found myself working on less important tasks simply because they were first on the list. It was wonderful to make progress on those long-neglected projects. However, the time spent on them should have been spent on more important things.<br><br>Has anyone found that the random system has made it easier to keep those things active when they shouldn't be?</div>

<div class="content">Learning, so sorry for all the hassles. If it helps, I'm always being treated like an idiot. I've never said, I'm Dr. Wilson when I see a professional, but I'm going to start. On the other hand, I feel very sorry for people who can't advocate for themselves because they either aren't educated or lack confidence to do so. At least you have the brains and the backbone to fight back!<br><br>Cricket, that was the problem with AF. I found myself doing things to finish a page that just didn't need to be done. However, I think the longer you use a method that beats procrastination, you'll start to have more energy to discern what does and does not need to be done.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Cricket<br>Thanks for the kind words.  For private reasons, I don't use that attorney any more. I'm attempting this myself.  I might just have to seek out another attorney who specializes in contract law.  I'm hoping to do this myself but the other two times I've had to use an attorney, I thought the same thing.  LOL!  We'll see...<br><br>Hi Mel<br>I have the same experience as you.  I use a list for that day or even that morning.  When I'm forced to use workarounds, I don't want to add less important stuff to my list.  I can easily do less important stuff.  The reason I need to use the cards for awhile is because I'm resisting something that's important and I want it worked on for X amount of progress TODAY.  I don't want to waste my efforts on stuff that can easily wait while I'm staring at my MIT's .  LOL!  That's why I prime the deck to favor my desired outcome.  I've been doing my method for years so I'm used to wanting my CI and MIT's done on the WILL DO list.  I also do other work but, in my mind, I can't to complete my WILL DO list.  Does that make sense?  As soon as I've broken out of stalemate, I just go back to the list.  I'm lazy.  I simply don't want to waste my time and effort on other work at the expense of completing my list.  I like the CI and MITs done first so that if something else comes up or I just want to chill, I'm still golden because the MIT's are out of the way.  LOL!  I've never stayed up late just doing tasks.  I've only done that to feel OK about my progress on the MITs while dealing with other unexpected important stuff that falls into my lap.  The rest can wait.  LOL!</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>I'm not advising that my way works for everybody. I'm simply stating that prioritizing works for me. In fact, I need the list in my face because I tend to drift badly. Short term memory loss with my naturally highly distractible brain requires prioritization. Otherwise, I've have lots of unfinished projects while I forget about my responsibilities. LOL! I used to live out of a calendar. Unfortunately, I no longer can do that. Actually, these different workarounds are a lifesaver! LOL!<br><br>p.s. my brains?

<div class="content">Hi Chris<br>LOL!  I've never had thought of a name for when I actually need to use it. Mine would probably be something like RHRR (reducing high resistance by randomness).  When the resistance is surmountable, it's faster to just push myself a bit harder.  One of these days, I'd like to try it on low stress recurring stuff and one offs.  It does sound fun.</div>

<div class="content">Random thought how to increase probability of choosing important tasks: weight them by "importance index". When counting tasks using random generator, count these "indexed" tasks exactly so many times as index shows:<br><br>Example:<br>- task A<br>- task B<br>- (4) important task C<br><br>You count task C as 4 identical tasks bellow each other.  When starting counting from task A, you will select task C with random number 3, 4, 5 or 6. Number 7 is task A again etc.</div>

<div class="content">Learning, my big problem is that as soon as I label something an MIT, I don't want to do it! It's that old rebel in me. It becomes a "should" then as though someone else is dictating to me. Unlike you, I feel like an idiot for not doing the most important things first. Because, as you mentioned, things come up! Then I wonder why I was so dumb. <br><br>I've found that I do okay ticking off the ONE important MIT first thing. But then I seem to lose steam. I also play all kinds of mind games by telling myself that the less important things have to be done sometime, too, or that I deserve the freedom. It's so immature.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mel<br>The only MITs I get stuck on are the ones I should do but don't want to.  That's the same for lots of folks.  I have to twist myself into a know the same as anybody who gets stuck.  That's what's workarounds are for.  It's not immature to use a work around.  At least the stuff gets done.  I don't find anything you've described as dumb.  In fact, many of my MITs are sort of dictated to me if they involve the law or protecting my finances.  Of course, I resent doing work that I find boring or aggravating.  I don't consider that dumb.  It's just how I feel.  When I'm in stalemate or even if I feel close to getting stuck, I pull out a workaround.  It's a circuitous route but it's not a dumb route.  A dumb route is waiting until the last minute to get going on it while assuming the world is sure to align with your agenda.  When I mean to get ABC and D progressed or finished today and X Y and Z come out of left field, sometimes working on Z because it involves $70K will take precedence over A which is worth $1,200, B that's worth $700 or C that I'm just working on early.  I care more about making good decisions when I need to than worry about sticking to a plan rendered obsolete in the present circumstances.  Again, that's why are rules are sometimes not relevant.  My day doesn't always go as planned.  Even my attitude doesn't always cooperate with my better sense.  So what?  That's what workarounds are for.  What I don't do, I try to appease myself with trickery.  When I'm willfully taking a break, I call it that.  When I need to switch off head banging work with a couple of rote jobs, I see it as that.  No sense lying to myself about it.  I know when I'm lying!  LOL!  p.s. The smaller stuff DOES have to been done before it blows up in your face but just say when you need easier work.  You're too smart to actually con yourself with plausible B.S.  I ALWAYS know when I'm trying to run that game on myself.  LOL!  Take a break and then get back to work.  That's better than totally blowing off the day's opportunities. yeah?  Rigid rules?  Nope.  Not when they get in the way of doing the right work or taking a needed break.  Who needs extra unnecessary and unhelpful stress of rules that don't match the current situation? That's what ultimately helps me overall.  I'm not advocating total anarchy after all.  I'm just advocating using good sense a bit more often than blindly adhering to  a rule set that's getting in your way of doing the right work in current circumstances , yeah?  LOL!  YVMV. <br><br>p.s. I wouldn't advice doggedly adhering to any rule set that make you feel compelled to lie yourself especially when you honestly feel that the rules are actually interfering with attacking the right work or is causing you totally unnecessary anxiety or guilt.  If your house was on fire or your pipes burst, you wouldn't consult your list.  Sometimes urgent importance is less obvious even when that importance is taking an honest break, not gaming the system.  What a waste of mental energy, right?  LOL<br><br>Bottom line: It's not dumb to hate certain jobs or use alternative methods to get you going when you need the assistance.  What seems dumb to me is feeling guilty when you're honestly putting out a good effort on worthy work.  No system can tell you that.</div>

For 99 cents you can add one of a number of different randomizer tools, or get them all for 2.99.<br><br>There are other free apps that seem simpler and better designed.
