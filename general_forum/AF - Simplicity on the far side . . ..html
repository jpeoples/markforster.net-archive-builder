<div class="content">So this is day 4 of AF for me - 3 observations so far . . .<br><br>1) Intuitive vs Rational - I have always been a more "flighty, intuitive" person by nature so the way that AF gives to sort and select tasks is absolutely brilliant for me.  It is putting a system in place that is not at war with my inherent leanings.  So far my productivity has gone way up and the days are flying by!!<br><br>2) "Trust the System" - This is a biggie - yesterday I had a tremendous amount of incoming work and mental stress, much of which subsided as I worked hard to let go and trust my brain to sort it out.  This really is a trick of the system - can we trust our intuitive and rational minds to work in harmony to solve the problems or situations that arise?<br><br>3) Simplicity - The set up is minimal and the maintenance unbelievably smooth - This is a key for folks like me for whom complexity bogs down - Love it!!<br><br>I have always resonated with the quote " I wouldn't give a fig for the simplicity on this side of complexity; I would give my right arm for the simplicity on the far side of complexity."  I believe that AF is a great embodiment of that - Thank you Mark for deconstructing success and giving us a beautifully simple tool.<br><br>I continue the experiment with interest. . .</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark<br><br>The following are links to tapes of a couple of conference sessions Mark did a few years ago.  They relate to a number of the tips and ideas from Mark's first book (Get Everything Done and Still Have Time to Play)<br><br><a href="http://www.essentialchristian.com/product_info.php?products_id=376" rel="nofollow">http://www.essentialchristian.com/product_info.php?products_id=376</a><br><a href="http://www.essentialchristian.com/product_info.php?products_id=343" rel="nofollow">http://www.essentialchristian.com/product_info.php?products_id=343</a><br><br>It does look as though the site ships to the US<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Christine. I didn't even know the recordings existed, let alone that they were selling them!</div>
