<div class="content">One thing that I notice with AF is that when I start the day, because the first pages are items I've been postponing doing, I find some friction right there getting going. One obvious workaround is to start on the last page and then work up to the earlier pages. Anyone else finding this?</div>

<div class="content">I would suggest to not start at the first page in the morning, but continue right where you left off the other day. This way you get to tackle the dreaded early tasks at different times each day. Perhaps they won't be so bad after lunch.</div>

<div class="content">Hi, where you left off is a great rule! Thanx for the tip.</div>

<div class="content">I've been overcoming this by telling myself if I work on the dreaded task on my first active page for just 15 minutes, I can rewrite it on my last page then cross it off.<br><br>In every case, I just kept going after 15 minutes and knocked it out.</div>

<div class="content">As Andreas says, it's best to start again where you left off. It's even better if before leaving work you pick the task you are going to start with the next day.</div>

<div class="content">Yes. Excellent point. Parking down hill.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark<br><br>Interesting that you pick the task you are going to start with the next day. That would enable you to feel that you can go straight back to your lists, but am I right in suspecting that the next day you may do a completely different item?  I always start with the page I was last working on, even though I may have felt I had gone as far as I could on that page at the time.  I am amazed at the number of times that I find a new item will stand out .....</div>

<div class="content">I've also always done it the way Christine describes.  Seems more intuitive to me.</div>

<div class="content">Christine:<br><br>Normally I start with the task which I picked the night before - usually because I picked it deliberately as a task which it would be easy to get going with.<br><br>However sometimes I leave the last task I was working on uncrossed off. When I start again the following morning I either do more work on it or cross it off and pick another item.<br><br>Either way I am starting again where I left off.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark<br><br>When you say "I picked it deliberately as a task which it would be easy to get going with" is that not using a rational approach?  When I leave a page, there may well be an item "standing out" but although I would always return to that page it would not feel right to predetermine that item for the next day.  In some cases that same item may stand out, in others it doesn't.</div>

<div class="content">Christine:<br><br>What I mean is that the task stands out because I know that I'm not going to do any work on it till tomorrow.</div>
