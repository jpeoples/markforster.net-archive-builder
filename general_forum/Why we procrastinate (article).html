<div class="content">It shouldn't surprise anyone that doing something concrete is easier and quicker than doing something abstract.<br><br>Doesn't mean it is always better. Sometimes the abstract is necessary; depends on complexity of the issue/task. Sometimes it sums up a lot of concrete things, which you already know flow from the abstract (so just thinking/writing 1 abstract is faster than 20 concrete).</div>

<div class="content">Interesting Article Smarky.<br><br>Certainly lines up with the experiences recorded on this forum where the solution has been to rephrase tasks and/or use AF as a tool to identify the effectively psychological issues causing the resistance in us in the first place.  The abstract nature of the first test in the articile immediately adds emotional content by asking why a task is done as opposed to how it is done.</div>

<div class="content">Just bear in mind that procrastination is not a simple thing.  People procrastinate for different reasons.  The most common is "overwhelm" and the article addresses that kind of  procrastination.  But the abstract/concrete approach described would not work so well with someone procrastinating because of fear of success, for example.  In fact, it might work in an opposite way.</div>
