<div class="content">I'm working now on my second day with a DIT/AF-hybrid – maybe it is a bit early to tell – but it is pretty much the best productivity system I have ever had. For most people the AF-system worked pretty well – but some people, like me, struggled with the system and tend to fall back to DIT. I started to procrastinate on my AF-list, did only trivial stuff and dismissed many items. <br><br>My idea was to incorporate the „structured procrastination“-approach of AF that balances the rational and intuitive parts of the brain into some DIT-ideas. It striked me that I'm more productive when I first pre-edit what I write down (e.g. make a rational decision, see below) and then work my way through it in a manner AF chooses the task (go through a closed list until something catches your attention).<br><br>This is what I do:<br>1.)I write everything down whenever it crosses my mind.<br>2.)I put everything I write down in an inbox and forget about it that day (create a buffer).<br>3.)I clear the inbox daily and make a rational decision what to do about it (I know, old GTD habits – but it works here for me...just hang on and read a bit further). <br>4.)I write the task in my task diary. My task diary is a notebook (A5), one day per page. On the left side of the page I jot down all my tasks that need to be done at a specific time of the day. On the right hand side I jot down every other task of that day. I use the „little and often“-approach and write the task down in manner that it can be dealt with in just a little time (e.g. instead of „write essay“ I put down „begin to write first draft of essay“)<br>5.)I review my daily tasks in the same manner as in the AF-system: I don't prioritise them and go through them until something stands out for me.<br>6.)I work on the task for as long as I like.<br>7.)I cross the item off and re-enter it when I'm not done with the task either on the following day or on the day I like to proceed (e.g. if the next day is a sunday and there is no need to work on that item).<br>8.)See 5 until I'm done (which is a pretty good feeling I don't have with AF). <br><br>The problem with AF for me was that I maybe got more done, but I wasn't more productive! I did trivial stuff instead of the more important tasks. <br><br>I asked myself: Do I really need for example to write 57 books down and THEN choose the books that I read by going through the list until some books will catch my attention? Why not use the 80/20-rule and run through the 57 books and choose the ones that stand out for me on that day and write these books down. I know, Mark will argue that the books the AF-system choose are a better assortment of books than he could choose. But in fact, the system is you (or your unconscious) and to write them down is an integral part of the system – but I found out that I could make the (unconscious) decision beforehand and then write only the tasks down that I really needed to do.<br><br>On other tasks I first made a rational decision based on the 80/20-rule. Instead of pages over pages with items that I would dismiss later anway I came up with 20 tasks that would fit easily on my page in the notebook. By using the „structured procrastination“-approach when choosing the tasks in the task diary I felt less resistance. I got less items done – but nevertheless I was more productive....<br><br>In short: <br><br>pre-edited items (choose until it stands out for you) and rational decisions (80/20-rule) made me more productive by actually doing less items<br><br>I only need one list (notebook) instead of a list AND a notebook<br><br>I can jot down time specific tasks<br><br>I still make heavy use of the „structured-procrastination“-approach and feel less resistance<br><br>I make use of a closed list and know when to call it a day and enjoy my spare time.</div>

<div class="content">Nice idea, M. Romer.<br><br>I have similar situation.  And asked how to conmbine it with daily / weekly goals and with your life long strategy.<br><br>Maybe you would like to take a look at some Excel formats similar to those that you are describing, with a daily format.  There is a Notebook and an Agenda:<br><br>   <a href="http://davidseah.com/publiki/Variations-of-Compact-Calendar-by-Sp/" rel="nofollow">http://davidseah.com/publiki/Variations-of-Compact-Calendar-by-Sp/</a><br><br>Also, you may want to read an interesting method named "Getting Shit Done" which has some similar aspects, like notebook contained, simplified GTD, similar to DIT with a Day's Objectives concept:<br><br>    <a href="http://utilware.com/gsd3.html" rel="nofollow">http://utilware.com/gsd3.html</a><br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>Spencer<br><br></div>

<div class="content">M. Romer,<br><br>This is not to criticise your system, but I'm not quite sure what is "hybrid" about it. Apart from steps 2, 3 and 4, which seem to owe more to GTD, this is just the standard method of using DIT.</div>

<div class="content">@Mark Forster:<br><br>Thanks for your answer. You are right, it's maybe a bit exaggerated to call it a "hybrid" - but the applied system owes at least a major aspect to Autofocus: In DIT I had only a couple of items (maybe 6-10) in my task diary; now I have more or less 15-30 items and I go through them as if it were a list in the Autofocus system (that is first quickly and the looking more slowly through the items until one catches my attention). I feel less tension  even when I choose more unpleasant tasks, which I think is the effect of structured procrastination. I had no such feeling whilst working with "regular" DIT. <br><br>But I understand your concern. If you think this system is out of place in a discussion forum concerning the Autofocus system, please feel free to delete this thread. I was just happy that the most intriguing feature of the Autofocus system, the lack of stress and overcoming the feeling of procrastination, could be integrated into my "beloved" DIT.<br><br>@Spencer:<br>Thanks for the links. I will definately look into that...</div>

<div class="content">By the way: The "write everything down forget about it and evaluate it later"-step has been made popular by Mr. Allen and his company but is by no means his invention, as far as I know. There has been a Harvard study that deals with the executive function of the brain and it's implications on time management (see: Stefan Klein: Time. A User's Guide. which is a pretty good book by the way) which came to the same conclusion earlier than GTD.</div>

<div class="content">M. Romer:<br><br>This forum is not exclusive to Autofocus, so don't worry about that.<br><br>What I was getting at is that in DIT I went through the Task Diary in exactly the same way that I recommend for AF - going through the items slowly and then one by one to see which stand out. So for me your method is not a hybrid - it's the standard way of doing DIT.</div>

<div class="content">@Mark Forster:<br>Well, I guess then I worked for the first time with DIT as it is supposed to be while having experimented with the Autofocus system! <br><br>I never had so many items in my Task Diary before - and really got them all done. I think the way I approach the items in the Task Diary brought me into a different mindset that comes close to the liberating feeling that many people apparently have with Autofocus - though Autofocus didn't work for me. Plain DIT and I feel illuminated....<br></div>

<div class="content">An interesting thread. <br><br>Re the book M. Romer mentioned I just wanted to add that it was originally published in German and is called "Zeit: Der Stoff, aus dem das Leben ist". I know that there are some German participants of this forum (like myself) who might find this helpful.</div>
