<div class="content">Just an observation (not a particularly big concern):<br><br>As I'm in backward mode (ie AF2), I often find myself going past a recent task that 'almost' stands out (or "ready to be done") but which I feel may be superseded by something earlier on the list. After reviewing another couple of pages, I realize that this first task is probably the best one to be doing right now and I end up going back to it.  This feels a little like I'm in AF1/closed list mode, i.e., where I would review a set of tasks at least once before choosing one.  At worst, it feels a little like I'm just using my AF list as a traditional To Do list.<br><br>Maybe this is simply how AF2 works in practice.  Do other people tend to operate in the same way, ie scanning up the list before settling on a task that "almost" stands out?<br><br>Andy<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Well, having just done the same thing myself, I can hardly tell you that you are wrong! <br><br>I think I mentioned in the original instructions for AF1 when I was describing "standing out" that I said that one would sometimes find oneself drawn back to an item after passing it. I don't think I was envisaging a couple of pages later though.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Mark<br><br>I tend to lie more at the "Kitchen sink" end of the AF spectrum so that, on days when i'm struggling against procrastination, I can easily find myself drifting through a couple of half completed pages looking for something that really stands out.<br><br>On such days, I probably end up doing something like a backward AF1 approach in which I force myself to do something on each page before continuing to move backwards.  If nothing stands out, I'll flip to the start of the list and enter into the genuine AF1 mode (ie forwards mode). <br><br>Andy</div>

<div class="content">I find as Mark says that sometimes an item waves as you pass and you get drawn back to it.  Revised AF keeps me moving through the list pretty rapidly and easily.  I have always considered a good measure of my productivity to be the amount of my active spent "doing" rather than "thinking about doing".  With AF, whichever method I am working I am "doing" a lot more often!</div>
