<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">There seems to be a growing consensus that an AF list should include fun things.<br><br>I have been resisting this and let me see if I can account for my reluctance:<br><br>A key value of an AF list is that it facilitates action on a lot of things that I might find hard to do or hard to remember or hard to find time for.  But fun things are not hard to do or hard to remember (though, admittedly, they might be neglected).  Furthermore, lots of fun things are so vital to my sense of wellbeing that I give them a really high priority and schedule them as "virtually" time specific items (e.g. go for a swim at 4pm).  (Similarly I would never put "eat lunch" on my list as there is not the remotest chance that I would forget lunch.  So, again, I treat it as a time specific item even though it is not strictly speaking time specific.)<br><br>Next, my AF list is for "work" (including lots of home jobs).  But I sense that if I mix in "purely recreational" items amongst my tasks, they might "stand out" all too readily and I might be tempted to do them in preference to pressing items that I really want to do even though they might be difficult.  (One danger with AF is that I might be tempted to do items in the order of easiest first and hardest last.  And some would argue that, all else being equal, it might be better to tackle the hardest first.)<br><br>Mind you, lots of my work is "fun" to me, and to that extent I am quite happy to include them on the list.  But what I refer to in this post is things I would never regard as "work". (e.g. going to the pictures, watching TV, going for a stroll around the block)<br><br>Finally, there is one aspect of Mark's "Instructions" that I do not recall anyone raising.  It is this: "This system can be quite addictive (at least that is what I've found) so you may find it is a good idea to set strict working hours.  Stop dead when the time is up..."  Clearly, when these instructions were written, Mark visuallized AF as applying only to "work".  That's where I think I still stand and I am inclined to regard the introduction of purely fun things as detrimental to the system, if that's not too strong a way of putting it.<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Jim<br><br>I definitely include "fun" things within AF and they do not stand out in any way that I would see as detrimental to the system.  I have "Family Tree" on my list and so far the times it has stood out have been Saturday's.  I am using my lists for all things, work, home, social and leisure, and everything is balancing just fine.  Previously I would have felt guilty if I had work related things to do, and spent time on fun things, even on a weekend.<br><br>I know that at the point I put something on my list it is something I want to do, therefore, if my lists are working effectively, they will get done (or dismissed as not being as important as I thought they might be). <br><br>I have to confess to having included "lunch" on my list on occasion - because I HAVE found myself so engrossed in my lists that I have forgotten the time ............<br><br>Because I have everything in my lists it makes it so easy to always be doing something that, for me, was important enough to know I needed or wanted to do it, and therefore put on my list, whether it be email, family tree, tax return or stack dishwasher.<br><br>Incidentally Mark did a post this morning, which you may not have seen, on this very point<br>which sums it up brilliantly<br><br>"The AF system is not designed to enable people to do everything, but instead to do the things which are really important to them while filtering out the other things. So you could indeed have put gardening on your AF list and it would have been interesting to see what happened to it. <br>February 1, 2009 at 8:49 | Mark Forster"</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jim M,<br><br>I can see some of the logic you're using, but as aone-man business working almost exclusively away from home, I have separated my AF lists into Office/Work (which includes my home office or the assignment/client's office) and Personal.<br><br>The reason is that there's a limit of Personal stuff I can actually do on assignment (especially if there's flaky Internet connection like here!), and when at home/home office, it helps me keep the focus on the one or the other, otherwise I flit from one task to the other without any direction or control.<br><br>But then some people, Christine B, like to pile it all onto one list, it seems to work for her.  That's the thing which some of us forget: AF isn't a formula anything like GTD etc, it's up to each of us to adopt or adapt the AF Principles Mark F has provided.<br><br>Mind you, I do sometimes mix in a Personal item in the Office/Work list, so i don't forget.  For example, I entered "Book TV in lodge lounge to watch highlights of South Africa's ODI cricket victory" followed by "Check see when DVD of SA Tour to Australia 2008/9 will be available."<br><br>I suppose it's sometimes how you define "fun", and i take your point about deriving fun from work tasks and vice versa, thank goodness.</div>

<div class="content">Jim<br><br>I totally agree with Roger - there is no hard and fast rule about whether you have separate lists for locations.  As Roger says one list works perfectly for me - because I am currently home based.  If I was working away at a client's office then I would keep a separate list pertaining to that location (or I believe that is what I will do - not applicable at present!)  I do keep a separate notebook for when I am away from "home" but just use that to add new items and then transfer - again, personal choice - I think Mark said at one point that the important thing is to have something to record on - even a scruffy piece of paper will do.  I also have separate lists for project type stuff - e.g. I have a separate list for "family tree"<br><br>I would say though that I think there "should" be a rule to include fun items!  It really helps me to focus and feel I have permission not to "work" 24/7 which is a danger.  Workaholicism and procrastination go hand in hand and the result is usually guilt ...... :-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jim,<br><br>How would you cover the case where there is something you love to do but it gets lost in the shuffle?  The other day I was listening to my iPod and I realized that I was not taking as much time to enjoy music as I would like.  It is something I really love, but it has been getting lost in the other things I do.  Putting a reminder on the list will bring it to my attention and I'll put on a CD while I'm doing some other things.  <br></div>

<div class="content">Jim:<br><br>From reading your posts I get the impression that you are theorising about this, rather than speaking from the actual experience of putting fun things on the list. My advice is always try it out and see what works for you. Until you try it, you really can't tell.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks to all who have responded to my post about fun items.  After your responses I have looked back ot my list and find that many of the things I have on it are what the average person would probably call fun items: <br>-design a birthday card for my nephew<br>-plan a weekend away<br>-look into a trip to UK<br>-browse around a bookshop<br>etc<br><br>Being semi-retired, I take on a lot of projects that are enjoyable and also require a bit of effort.  Only about one third of my items would relate to work I need to do to make a living.  So you would find that I would certainly put Gardening on my list if it were not for the fact that I normally do it automatically on a Sunday evening.  And, Christine, I would certainly put Family Tree on my list if that were one of my interests.  And, Mike, I do have Listen to Music on my list because I value it highly as a thing to do.<br><br>But I also feel the need to have time away from my list.  I need time to do "nothing".  I need distractions, amusements, pastimes, diversions.  These are the things I have not bothered to put on the list.  They happen spontaneously when I let go and just drift along.<br><br>So I have been confining my list to things that are important to me in themselves (including enjoyable things) and that require a bit of effort and mindful attention.  <br><br>However, maybe I will try a few items like Potter Around, or Mope Around the House or even Daydream.  (Actually, that last one really appeals - I'm putting it on the list immediately).<br><br>Many thanks all you lovely people who are part of this forum.  I have gained much encouragement and inspiration from your contributions.  <br><br></div>

<div class="content">WOW, great thread ! Thanks for everyone for their ideas... Jim, I love the "Potter Around, or Mope Around the House or even Daydream." I am also going to be adding one of my current favorite "do nothing actvities, "nonmeditation" (basically just sitting without distractions and letting the mind go where it wants.) <br><br>Christine, one thing I've wondered is whether you basically spend all your "discretionary" time working off your AF lists? I have tended to do things like potter around the house, check email etc., OUTSIDE my "AF list time" but wondered about trying to put more things on my AF list and then just trying to stick to the list more...</div>

<div class="content">Jim, I keep separate @Work and @Home books as I personally like the distinction between the two to be quite clear cut even though I am largely home-based. However, as I have worked through the Beta test i too noticed how my list were very task driven and didn't include many of the R&R type items that many were posting about. As a result I have now included fun, aspirational and non-task type items in my lists such as listening to CD's, meditation, potter in garden on the @Home and arranged coffee catch ups with colleagues (non-work directed) visit church for lunchtime recital near to office.<br><br>As a result I have not in any way compromised the increased productivity that AutoFocus has given me, but I have enhanced my general sense of well being hugely. The "fun" items do not push out the task driven ones, but actually complement them, by effectively giving me a break when needed, they present themselves at the right times, a great example of the rational and the intuitive working together.<br><br>Ohh and I've just added Daydream to my list list too :-)<br><br>Good luck and let us know how you are getting on.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Bev<br><br>In answer to your question I have actually tried both, and find that using as much of my discretionary time as possible on my lists works best.  However that is because I am putting a lot of routine and fun things on my list as well.<br><br>I also have a lot less resistance to doing items if I am doing them from the list (because I am actioning them when they stand out) rather than outside the list.  This past week has been particularly interesting because I was having to work with some larger than usual projects on a more intensive basis than I suspect I would have had to do had I been using AF for longer.  Consequently things like checking email were being done "off list" but I had quite a resistance, even though I was dealing with them.  It was interesting to note how today, when I went back to my lists properly, I cleared many more emails and more easily, than when actioning that same task outside of AF.<br><br>There is clear evidence for me that working with my lists dramatically improves my productivity and when I am not working from them I can feel that sense of "I've got so much to do" starting to return.  By using them, or at the very least reviewing them, within my discretionary time, I can actually choose a task like "catch up on recorded TV shows" (which became a task as my favourite procrastinator was being ignored) and catch up on TV without guilt that I should be doing something else.  Generally that would be in the evening but I have also found that I can catch up on some shows whilst filing, so do two tasks at once!  Wouldn't recommend it in an office tho'!</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Christine (for both of your responses ... one on the other thread). As always, very helpful. I have decided to add a lot more "fun" things to my list too and to work off of my AF lists more. I also really like your idea of doing two tasks at once, and now have started to find ways to do that too!! :o) thanks again.</div>
