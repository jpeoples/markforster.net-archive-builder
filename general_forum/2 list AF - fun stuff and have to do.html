<div class="content">I noticed that I tended to use AF for "have-to-do" stuff imposed by obligations more than "could-do-for-fun" things. It was a surprising observation as it suggested I was not so "serious" about fun, so I no have a normal couln for imposed tasks and a deliberate 2nd column for fun. It's an interesting shift of perspective for me.</div>

<div class="content">I'm thinking of dividing it, too, but the 2nd list will be "morning routine". I can never decide what to do after my morning walk. In theory, I can be done all my dailies by 11am, leaving me an hour before lunch, but by the end of the week it's clear that I always run of of time for the same thing. So, maybe randomize that set.</div>

<div class="content">Michael, it is interesting that yesterday I thought about something very similar. I do not use AF, I use classic daily planning in the morning: choosing tasks which I want to do that day. I realized that usually I put there "have-to-do" stuff, because I am somehow reluctant to plan "fun" stuff for the later moment of the day. One reason is that fun is for me something spontaneous, which I should choose with "spur of the moment" - I do not want to plan before, but freely choose AT THAT MOMENT one task from checklist of many ideas what I could do (books to read, movies to watch....etc). But because of hectic focusing on my daily plan...I usually forget.<br><br>So I exactly thought of two parallel TM processes: one for "have-to-do" (daily plan + other well-proven methods), one for "fun" (reserve time, than consult only loose checklist/ideas). Which does not mean that I should not plan some complicated "fun" activities sometimes, but I would prefer to plan the usual, repeated ones rather generally (e.g. make time for a walk trip) + decide in the moment (where to go).</div>
