<div class="content">In my day job, I manage 7 developers and QA. Our Product Owner prioritizes most of their work, but part of my job is working with the PO to ensure we're working on the right things and coding them in the right way. <br><br>I have so many ideas of things that I would like to improve with the team, or things that frustrate me, or training I would like to pass down (to "teach people to fish"). Some ideas & projects are partially written out, most haven't been fleshed-out yet. Some projects are demonstrably higher-priority, but I don't have a good system to move those forward or even break out tasks. Ideally I would delegate much of the execution once I identify what I want people to do. <br><br>I find managing & prioritizing this "personal idea backlog" overwhelming and challenging. Often when I do get a chance to work on it, I instead shut down. My creativity potential is high, but the lack of order is holding it back. In my current state, all these ideas are worthless because they're not leading to action. <br><br><br>I read Getting Things Done, I have started reading Mark's DIT book (recommended by a Manager Tools forum post when I searched about 'Eat That Frog'). I use Amazing Marvin todo software, I have some familiarity with various ways to work through a todo list. But my problem feels at a higher level than that - how can I avoid perfectionism and overwhelm in an oversized list of underdefined projects ? How can I effectively track, capture brainstorms, and prioritize/defer these ideas that aren't yet actionable tasks? <br><br>If it matters, I am a High C and High D in the Manager Tools' DISC assessment. <br><br>I find the Autofocus system here interesting, as well as Guest Post: How to Pursue All Your Goals. I haven't dug into those deeper, nor have I finished DIT book yet. <br><br>Open to any suggested mindsets, blogs, books, processes, etc. Thank you!</div>

<div class="content">Nathan, a few quick thoughts: <br><br>	1.	Any system can work if you actually use it. The key is consistency. If you peruse this forum, you'll see that Mark Forster has discussed this point ad nauseam. <br><br>	2.	Don’t try to fix emotional or anxiety issues with productivity hacks. It usually doesn’t work. For instance, a messy house might not just be about lacking a system—it could be due to family stress or parents feeling overwhelmed. Marital issues rarely improve with post-it notes, or time blocking. <br><br>	3.	Back to the first point: Pick a system and stick with it as the author intended, at least for a few weeks. If it doesn’t feel right after a few days, try another. But if you can push through the initial phase (say, 4-5 weeks), you might find it suits your needs. Then, you can start tweaking it to fit your style. I'd wager many of the regulars on this forum have their own workflow, after many trials and errors with Mark's systems. In fact, while Mark's ideas have been instrumental in some of my thinking, my actual system looks nothing like Autofocus, DIT, DWM, etc. <br><br>	4.	Whatever system you choose, a weekly review or reflection is crucial. Ask yourself: What worked last week? What didn’t? What changes can I make to make the next week more productive, meaningful, or fun? Tweak, experiment, and observe. Repeat. <br><br>	5.	Take all productivity advice with a grain of salt. When Stephen Covey was asked how he got so much done, he said (paraphrasing): “I have a lot of hired help.” That’s great for him, but most of us don’t have that luxury.</div>

<div class="content">"I find managing & prioritizing this "personal idea backlog" overwhelming and challenging."<br><br>I'm not surprised, we all think of dozens of ideas every day and it's tempting to capture them all and put them in some system and then try to work them all via that system. And then we're looking for the right system that somehow parses all this and tells us what to do.<br><br>I've found that this is putting the cart before the horse, and leads to stress and pain, with a constant "fear of missing out" on that one great idea that we're sure might go somewhere. That's part of that sense of perfectionism you describe.<br><br>Many of the things we capture in a system are us noticing ourselves thinking about something. Capturing all that as it washes over our awareness is basically just noise. It's supposed to be a fleeting idea in the moment, not something we grab hold of and are then forced to drag around, like some anchor that tires us out.<br><br>I would say turn your focus to your business and let that guide your actions. What does the business need to do to grow? What do the people in your team need to support that? Pick a couple of ideas which speak to you right now along those lines and turn those into actions. It's at this point any systems or tools can assist with the execution of the already-decided ideas.</div>

<div class="content">I think about this all the time and for me, I have to make it pretty binary. I'm either doing the task or I'm not.  That means I have to shove most of my list into a "not now" bucket and only work on one thing at a time. I didn't necessarily like the whole book "The ONE Thing" by Gary Keller but the thesis question of it was “What's the One Thing I can do / such that by doing it / everything else will be easier or unnecessary?”  It is a pretty powerful idea that is worth considering.  Even it is applied to a time frame as short as a day.</div>

<div class="content">I have given up with systems, prioritising, urgency etc. I was wasting too much time with organising which also strangely led to procrastination. Only thing that works for me is overall allocating enough time to do everything (not taking on too much) and just do everything first time I see it, oldest first, no matter how important or urgent. Never defer anything. The oldest task I ever have now is only a day or two, so urgency never matters. If you can get to this state and maintain, it is bliss! It took a lot of hard work to get to this position but so worth it. I suppose I’m just doing Mark’s do it tomorrow system and it is certainly working for me.</div>

<div class="content">PS Do it tomorrow will be a reality check that you can’t do all those projects you would like to move forward as you have way too much of a backlog to process. In which case you could develop a calendar system to feed them in slowly over x months in a manageable way and perhaps oldest first.</div>

It worked very well until my boss told me in no uncertain terms that when he gave me something to do he did not expect it to go at the end of the queue!</div>

<div class="content">@Mr Done<br><br>I remember when you were Mr Backlog and then announced your emancipation from it by  reducing your work and working FIFO.   I was wondering if you were able to maintain it.  Sounds like you have.  Nice work!<br><br>I have recently realized that a lot of my extra work could be described as an unnecessary lay-over in airplane travel. Even though it initially looks like I will save with the extra coordination,  the variables are too risky.   The quickest way to a destination is non-stop.  <br><br>Brent</div>

<div class="content">In answer to the original post: <br><br>Based upon what you wrote, perhaps using a kanban board might help.  I don't have the same situation of you, so I can't speak from experience. <br> <br>If you have read Getting Things Done, you can refer to the book. <br>1.  Make a list of your areas of responsibility in your job. This is described under 20,000 ft horizon. <br>2. Make a list of your current projects. This is at Horizon at 10,000 ft. <br>3. Do a mind dump of all the ideas that you like to do.  Perhaps writing them down and seeing them might reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed.  <br>4.  Answer the question which of these ideas you are currently investigating, or deciding on. <br>5. Which of the current projects are in the finishing stage?  Are there any that need a last minute sprint of energy or time, or do any need a relaxed cleanup and follow up?  Do any need to be replaced with a new project? <br>6. So now there are several lists. <br>1. Ideas<br>2. Researching <br>3. Deciding<br>4. Doing<br>5. Finishing<br><br>Kanban has similar categories.  <br>Keep the mind dump of IDEAS, and perhaps in the future you will have time to implement them. <br>7. Compare the list of areas of responsibility with the lists to see if there is any area that is overloaded or neglected. <br>8. Is there free time to add any more projects to the current list? <br>9.  If so, decide on which project to start from your list of ideas, or ones that are being researched.  <br><br>Perhaps this would help. David Allen recommends when clarity is needed that go up the Horizons of Focus.  This might be all that is needed.  However,  I have found it doesn't necessary get the tasks done, that would be Ground Level Horizon.  <br><br>Since the original poster has read Getting Things Done, I answered the post with that book in mind, but perhaps others would have other advice more from this forum. <br><br>I have been waiting to see what others have to comment, because the original poster seems to be quite competent already, and in the process of investigation, and will likely find something that will suit the situation.</div>

<div class="content">If managing multiple projects is the main thing that the original poster has to do on the job, I have read this book, which is quite detailed on this subject: <br><br>https://books.google.com/books?id=BZJErbORiHcC&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&dq=managing+multiple+projects&source=gbs_navlinks_s<br><br>Managing Multiple Projects <br>by Michael and Irene Tobias</div>

<div class="content">Going back to Mr. Done's FIFO, reminds me that there is one of my systems which is a *flexible* FIFO system - and a very effective one too. In fact it's the system I'm using myself at the moment.<br><br>The system is The Final Version (FV). It's a long-list system into which you can dump anything, and it will sort it all out for you. <br><br>The rules are:<br><br>Draw up your list. It can be as long as you like and you can keep adding to it. Then process it as follows:<br><br>1. Dot the first task on the list.<br>2. Go through the list, asking yourself the question "What do I want to do before x?" (x being the last task dotted). <br>3. Dot the first task with a positive answer to the question.<br>4. Continue the scan from the task you have just dotted, using the same question but with x as the newly dotted task.<br>5. Repeat this process until you reach the end of the list.<br>6. Now do all the dotted tasks in order from the end of the list to the beginning.<br>7. Repeat<br><br>What this does is give you a "slice" through the list of different urgencies, importances and difficulties. But the first task on the list is always included.</div>

<div class="content">I have begun to divide up my projects/tasks for one area of my personal life, and into categories such as I suggested in a previous post, and I have spent 90 minutes and I am not near finished yet.  It takes time, and is a project in itself. <br><br>David Viscott recommends use of an Action Board, similar to a Kanban Board, in his book . <br>"Emotionally free : letting go of the past to live in the moment", from pages 283 to 296.   He was a psychiatrist, and likely used this in counseling people, and probably was successful if he coached on it week after week and could pursue progress on it with his clients.  The concept is similar to David Allen's Horizons of Focus.  There are other books suggesting dividing one's life into areas, and seeking a balance between them.  It works for some, but not for others.   My impression is that it will work if it becomes a way of life. But it requires a lot of analysis, and even when one is finished it doesn't necessarily mean that you have the drive to implement it.  Regardless, just have a picture or overview can be useful.  <br><br>Here is an adaption of it. <br>https://tomborgconsulting.com/use-action-board-grow-small-business/</div>

<div class="content">I'm sure the perfect system is a combination of simple scan/FV etc - basically dotting things that need doing asap, then onto FIFO<br>I do that when coming back from holiday or get too much coming in at one time and go into backlog of more than a couple of days.<br>The only thing I don't like about dotting things is that I have a tendency to procrastinate on things I don't want to do. Sometimes it can be quite severe and I just keep putting the task off. It seems if I see the task more than a few times it becomes a subconscious "difficult issue" in my brain. I'm much better when in the flow and just do things the first time I see and procrastination disappears. I need blinkers!<br>Is that just me or do other have similar issues?</div>

<div class="content">I can be the same way, MrDone, in that I can build a habit of "putting off" something that keeps coming up to me. However, I've also found that once I realize that I'm doing this, just the realization that this is what is happening can "undo" the effect. <br><br>I do think there is something nice about FV. The thing that helped me the most, though, was the idea of sitting with an idea in your mind and understanding it, and getting in touch with all the things that one is feeling or thinking about the task. Especially, getting in touch with the emotional elements has helped me to make things real to me, and helped to undermine questions about "how do I even start?" such that it undermines my brains desire to avoid the task. <br><br>I find Time Surfing to have the most pleasant treatment of the above concept around procrastination, but using it requires that you actually do the mental practice, and you can often try to go about your day and not want to "play by the rules" as it were. I found that I sort of avoided FV precisely because it felt like I was getting forced into something, but a part of me also knows, I think, that if I applied the same mental game with myself, and just embraced and accepted the rules, I doubt I would have much problem with procrastination in that respect. Just accepting the FIFO element of FV would be enough, since then I would have "permission" to do something because the rules say so. <br><br>What I've found naturally happening as I work without a list, though, is that I have certain high, intense priorities that I tend to hyper focus on, and I'll intentionally leave a lot of admin for as long as I care to, before sitting down and processing all of that admin stuff as a big chunk. With other systems, I think I did the admin stuff better, but I did feel that it took my attention "off the ball" too much for my comfort. It's that classic battle between the little things and the "big" things. I've become okay with letting a lot of the little things go, since I've created enough slack that those little things don't have to be done immediately. <br><br>Still, all this talk of this stuff makes me want to try a FIFO style system (probably FV) just to see! I had great luck with a no-list "FIFO" in the form of Ivy Lee lists (6 items, prioritized the night before, done in order the next day).</div>

<div class="content">I’ve been doing a soft style of FIFO for years, which I call my lap list. It has a vague resemblance to AF4.  The basic pattern is you may work any task, but you must work older tasks first.<br><br>Construction:<br>1. Make a short list of things you intend to do very soon.<br>2.  At the end, draw a line, called the lap line.  Whenever there are no more items above the line [Lap completed: Celebrate!], draw a new line at the end. <br>3. You may add items below the line, but it must still be things you intend to do soon.<br><br>(Aside, I keep other lists that feed into the above lap list.  I don’t add directly from thought to list unless it’s urgent.)<br><br>Action:<br>4. Scan the sublist of items above the line.  Pick one and do it.<br>5. Continue scanning and picking and doing, but now you may cross below the line.<br>6. When you reach the bottom, return to step 4.</div>
