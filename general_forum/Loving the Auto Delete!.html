<div class="content">My 1 month old tasks are really starting to roll in, and, wow, I love the way they just disappear!<br><br>These are the things that seemed likely or important and yet I didn't do a single thing to move them forward, so BAM--off the list!<br><br>In every other method (including the AFs), I was inclined to let those guys hang around, but it is very liberating to have them forced off the list by the passage of time. <br><br>There's another thread going right now with lots of talk about prioritizing. I think after a few months of DWM (still needs a better name!), the list will have completely righted itself and contain nothing but true, committed-to tasks--all of which, to me, would then count as high priority. Love it!</div>

<div class="content">Hey, don't be too selfish! :) You should share DWM approach with GTD brothers :) The problem is DWM now limited to paper users. I'm on Windows Mobile with small screen (Palm Treo Pro). Can we invent DWM prcedure for us, WM GTD users?</div>
