<div class="content">I'm starting a new AF book, and am putting some of my favourite quotes in the front pages.  Does anybody have some suggestions?  <br><br>Here are some I've got so far:<br><br>"One day your life will flash before your eyes.  Make sure it's worth watching." - Anon<br><br>"Great things are not done by impulse, but by a series of small things brought together." - Vincent van Gogh<br><br>"The time comes in life when we have read enough.  It's time to stop reading.  It's time to lay down the books and write." - Albert Einstein<br><br>"Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one's courage."  - Anais Nin<br><br>"If you hear a voice within you saying 'you are not a painter', then by all means paint and that voice will be silenced."  - van Gogh<br><br>And one I heard during an old Bette Davis interview:<br>"A good percentage of our time is spent doing things that we loathe.  Marvelous!  It puts starch in your spine." - Bette Davis<br><br></div>

<div class="content">My absolute favorite: <br><br>"Have patience with everything that remains unsolved in your heart. Try to love the questions themselves, like locked rooms and like books written in a foreign language. Do not now look for the answers. They cannot now be given to you because you could not live them. It is a question of experiencing everything. At present you need to live the question. Perhaps you will gradually, without even noticing it, find yourself experiencing the answer, some distant day."<br><br>- Rainer Maria Rilke<br>  Letters to a Young Poet</div>

<div class="content">Ok, some of my favorite quotes have already been done - Rilke (IMHO the best poet of the 20th century), Nin and van Gogh's silenced voice. Here's what I have on my daily sheet:<br><br>Don't let what you can't do get in the way of what you can do. <br>  - John Wooden<br><br>Do what you can, with what you have, where you are.<br>  - Theodore Roosevelt<br><br>And just for the fun of it, here's some Douglas Adams:<br>"The Guide is definitive. Reality is frequently inaccurate."<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Divide each difficulty into as many parts as necessary to resolve it. - Rene Descartes <br><br>A habit cannot be tossed out the window; it must be coaxed down the stairs a step at a time. - Mark Twain <br><br>The long span of the bridge of your life is supported by countless cables called habits, attitudes, and desires. What you do in life depends upon what you are and what you want. What you get from life depends upon how much you want it—how much you are willing to work and plan and cooperate and use your resources. The long span of the bridge of your life is supported by countless cables that you are spinning now, and that is why today is such an important day. Make the cables strong! - L.G. Elliott <br><br>I never could have done what I have done without the habits of punctuality, order, and diligence, without the determination to concentrate myself on one subject at a time. - Charles Dickens <br><br>The shorter way to do many things is to do only one thing at a time. - Mozart <br><br>The successful person has the habit of doing the things failures don't like to do. They don't like doing them either necessarily. But their disliking is subordinated to the strength of their purpose. -  E.M. Gray <br><br>It's not the work that's hard, it's the discipline. - Anon<br><br>Perseverance is more prevailing than violence; and many things which cannot be overcome when they are together, yield themselves up when taken little by little. - Plutarch <br><br>Perseverance is not a long race; it is many short races one after another. - Walter Elliott <br><br>All great masters are chiefly distinguished by the power of adding a second, a third, and perhaps a fourth step in a continuous line. Many a man has taken the first step. With every additional step you enhance immensely the value of your first. - Ralph Waldo Emerson <br><br>Success seems to be connected with action. Successful men keep moving. They make mistakes, but they don't quit. - Conrad Hilton <br><br>One of the commonest mistakes and one of the costliest is thinking that success is due to some genius, some magic - something or other which we do not possess. Success is generally due to holding on, and failure to letting go. You decide to learn a language, study music, take a course of reading, train yourself physically. Will it be success or failure? It depends upon how much pluck and perseverance that word "decide" contains. The decision that nothing can overrule, the grip that nothing can detach will bring success. Remember the Chinese proverb, "With time and patience, the mulberry leaf becomes satin." - Maltbie Davenport Babcock <br><br>A "No" uttered from deepest conviction is better and greater than a “Yes” merely uttered to please, or what is worse, to avoid trouble. - Gandhi <br><br>What you have to do and the way you have to do it is incredibly simple. Whether you are willing to do it, that's another matter. -  Peter F. Drucker</div>

<div class="content">Mark, I'm trying to follow the "new multi-tasking" that Mozart (although Colin says it's Samuel Smiles - I'll have to research this...) recommends in:<br><br>The shorter way to do many things is to do only one thing at a time. <br><br>Well, in terms of taking on a bajillion projects anyway. :-)<br><br>I thought Drucker's quote particularly applied to Autofocus:<br><br>What you have to do and the way you have to do it is incredibly simple.

<div class="content">Jacqueline:<br><br>Most quotes get attributed to a whole variety of people. I think the favourites are Einstein, Abraham Lincoln and Mahatma Ghandi. It doesn't really matter very much in my opinion, since the references to the actual work or occasion are very rarely given.<br><br>Compare:<br><br>"As a Christian I have no duty to allow myself to be cheated, but I have the duty to be a fighter for truth and justice."  G.K. Chesterton<br><br>with<br><br>"As a Christian I have no duty to allow myself to be cheated, but I have the duty to be a fighter for truth and justice. " Adolf Hitler<br><br>The second is the correct attribution!</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br>I've sometimes chosen a book to read based on a quotation out of it.  (I'm not going to be reading the collected speeches of Adolf Hitler any time soon - that's one of my occultist brother's interests.)  That's why I wonder - who is this Samuel Smiles person?  How come I've never heard of him?  Even Jack Handey of "Deep Thoughts by Jack Handey" (Saturday Night Live) was a real person.<br><br>They always attribute that Marianne Williamson passage to Nelson Mandela because he presumably used it in his inaugural speech - but that turned out to be an urban legend too.  Oh well, it's a nice quote anyway. :-)<br><br>Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.</div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline offers "A habit cannot be tossed out the window; it must be coaxed down the stairs a step at a time. - Mark Twain "<br><br>I think he's wrong.  Earlier this year I went from drinking a litre of strong coffee a day to zero.  Didn't feel good for some weeks, but the habit was discarded overnight.<br><br>The problem with many platitudes and pronouncemnets is that even when they come from famous people and are uttered with a confidence that lends them an aura of deep wisdom, than can be just dead wrong.

<div class="meta">2009-06-25 1:33</div>
<div class="content">David, I think it depends on what kind of habit it is - and what kind of person the individual is. <br><br>If it was something like coffee (a quite addictive substance), I'd likely substitute a glass of water for every second cup of coffee, and ease into it.  Or switch to green tea.  No use giving myself headaches to get to a goal a bit faster.  Smoking?  Cold turkey worked the best because it was so hard to detox I never wanted to go through that again.  Getting into a habit of exercise?  I do best if at first I never miss a day, but don't put in the 2 hours a day that I have when training hard in the past.  Getting in the habit of cleaning the house regularly?  Baby steps and little routines work wonders.  <br><br>The Ken Olsen quote?  Check out snopes, that's another quote taken completely out of context.  And DEC was bought out by Compaq about 10 years ago, so it did go somewhere.<br><br><a href="http://www.snopes.com/quotes/kenolsen.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.snopes.com/quotes/kenolsen.asp</a><br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">(((Jacqueline)))<br>AGAIN, you bring tears to my eyes!  Before I became disabled, I could simply use my sense of decency and responsibility to do what I had to do to keep my conscience reconciled.  The same stuff kept me on point when I had to partake in the duller aspects of relentless and gruelling practicing to progressively attain mastery of my talents and ambitions.  <br>Although I'm much further along with accepting who and what I am now, I do get maudlin and feel real shame about being disabled.....hence, tolerated far more often than respected.  *blush*  When the pain and shame combo has me wanting to to quit trying....or to chide myself because I'm relegated to doing the mundane in 5 minutes increments.....I get disheartened.  Worse, I shame myself with thoughts like....It took you half hour to mop the floor, you bloodied up your food....now you have to throw it all away...don't talk because people think you're mentally handicapped or a drunk.......then....I think.....HELL TO!  I'm going to squeek out whatever's in me to claim whatever I can out of this life of mine.  I may be undesired and handicapped....but my honor and courage are intact!!!!!  Now, get off my ass and find the gratitudes that are there waiting for my notice!!!!!.................and.............there the gratitudes are.....patiently awaiting my notice........<br>Thank you, Jacqueline!  I'm so busy feeling like a damn buffoon mopping my floors 5 minutes at a time until they pass my satisfactions, I allow the shame to mask that I'm still working from a perspective of the same courage and honor my Dad taught me.  He also used to say, (not verbatum, but the jist of it...)Learning is always time well spent.  What separates man from the beasts is the capacity to feel compassion.  When you add intelligence to that compassion, it is elevated to wisdom.  <br>I, too often, allow my ego to trump my compassion in matters of my disabilities........You have offered me a nugget of wisdom my Dad used to talk about.......Thank you, Jacqueline......I needed this reminder to honor what drives me to be my best and stay at my work......not necessarily the pathetic implementation!  ROTFL!  <br>I forget that what's inside me isn't any different than before....<br>learning as I go<br></div>

The ritual of wiping my face and upper chest with cool water "wipes away some of the fatigue".....I catch my breath.....gear up my mind for another round....5 more minutes.........until I'm done to my satisfaction (I've learned to crank down the bar a bit on these types of days!

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br>You always seem to tug at my heartstrings.....You quote sounds like I'm listening to my dad shoring me up except the life will be easy part.  He used to say that things may feel effortless if you're willing or enjoying or totally engrossed, but never look for easy.....it's rarely fulfilling.  Maybe he brainwashed me, but that's usually true...unless I'm intentionally in repose....but that's more about refreshing your mind or soaking in life's magesty, not looking for "easy".  Challenge and excitement are what I love most.  Effortless is more about attitude and/or mastery/familiarity.....not easy, yeah?<br>learning as I go<br></div>

<div class="content">Aristotle:<br>Virtue, then, is of two kinds, intellectual and moral. Intellectual virtue springs from and grows from teaching, and therefore needs experience and time. Moral virtues come from habit. . . . They are in us neither by nature, nor in despite of nature, but we are furnished by nature with a capacity for receiving them, and we develop them through habit. . . . These virtues we acquire by first exercising them, as in the case of other arts. Whatever we learn to do, we learn by actually doing it: men come to be builders, for instance, by building, and harp players, by playing the harp. In the same way, by doing just acts we come to be just; by doing self-controlled acts, we come to be self-controlled; and by doing brave acts, we become brave. . . .<br><br>Do not wish to be anything but what you are, and to be that perfectly.  ~ Saint Francis de Sales<br><br>It doesn't matter how well you walk the path, if it's not your path. ~ Katherine Benziger<br><br>Life must be measured by thought and action, not by time. ~ Sir John Lubbock</div>

<div class="content">Apropos neurosis and getting things done:<br><br>"I once read about a man who believed himself to have a fish in his jaw. This fish moved about, and caused him a lot of discomfort. When he tried to tell people about the fish, they thought him ‘crazy’, which led to violent arguments. After he’d been hospitalized several times - with no effect on the fish - it was suggested that perhaps he shouldn’t tell anyone. After all it was the quarrels that were getting him put away, rather than the delusion. Once he’d agreed to keep his problem secret, he was able to lead a normal life. We may not have a fish in our jaw, be we all have its equivalent."<br>— Keith Johnstone in Impro</div>
