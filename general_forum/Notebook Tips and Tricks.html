<div class="content">I just recorded a short video with a few notebook related tips and tricks that I have been using. I have been using AutoFocus for the past few weeks (coming from straight GTD with OmniFocus) and I have gotten tons more crossed off my list since the switch.<br><br>Hope the tips help! Let me know what you think in the comments!<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdHlxXOcuy8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdHlxXOcuy8</a></div>

<div class="content">Jacob:<br><br>Interesting video, but is it my imagination or is it a mirror-image? Everything seems to be the wrong way round.</div>

<div class="content">Nice video Jacob - I like the idea of noting your smart work objectives in the notebook too - I think I will add that to my work notebook so it is easy to remind myself what my work objectives actually are. Hopefully this will stop me keep getting pulled into other people's work goals and neglecting my own</div>

<div class="content">@Mark Forster / I think you're right! I just did a quick video using Photo Booth on my iMac and I think it automatically mirrors the image. I guess I could say I did it on purpose so it is harder for everyone to read the items on my list though! :-)</div>
