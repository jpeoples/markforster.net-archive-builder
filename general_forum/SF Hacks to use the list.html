<div class="content">In a previous threat, Mark wrote: <br><br><<I use my list all the time - literally from the time I get up to the time I go to bed. I've found it to be incredibly strong and resilient in all circumstances. It worked perfectly for me when I had children and grandchild around, when I was testing out the system, when I was ill over the last week, and is still working perfectly now>><br><br>In theory, I would like to use SF, hell any system, as religiously as Mark. However I resist, I'm not interested in analyzing why I do, but I do. However, without a holistic approach, it's too easy to drift from using SF. So I'm going to try and do the following: <br><br>I will time (via a stopwatch) the amount of time I do things while sticking to SF rules. Each night, I'll make a note of how long I worked within an SF environment. By the end of the week, I should have a good idea of how much time I spent working from my lists, and how well my projects are doing. I'm hoping this will serve as a catalyst to keep working from my lists. <br><br>Any other ideas (besides: "Just do it" and/or "Use SF all day and night)?</div>

<div class="content">Just don't? I'm of the opinion that time off is a good thing. And since you consider Mark's words a threat (;-) you must agree. Truly though, how many here are 100 percenters?  Get to where you're doing the list enough (intuition) and stop.</div>

<div class="content">With SF, I've been pretty close to 100% of discretionary time on SF, unless (like today) I had such a bad headache that it was physically painful to try to read my list.  :-)    I was actually hoping to try out "dismissal due to illness" but just couldn't even see the items on the page, LOL.   (New question for Mark - should we dismiss everything when we can't see the items on the page?   LOL)</div>
