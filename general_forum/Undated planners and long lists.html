<div class="content">I'm thinking of using an undated planner with a large number of blank-ish pages as a combined "diary/schedule" and long list system. Has anyone tried this before? The idea is that the monthly calendar view would let me put reminders, schedule meetings, and do other "planner" type stuff, but then the large number of undated pages would allow me to simply use that space as a giant long list with dates at the top indicating the day that page was started. <br><br>The idea is to keep a paper diary and the long list in the same, single book as opposed to keeping two separate books. Anyone tried this?</div>

<div class="content">In the Bullet Journal scene the technical term for a custom designed page ist a "spread". Just search online for "BuJo monthly calendar spread" and such. You will get tons of ideas.<br><br>What you are talking about is essentially the same as a BuJo but "pimped" with a decent time managment core from a good vendor like Forster Technologies from Britain.</div>

<div class="content">Hahah, I'm familiar with the BuJo stuff, and used it for a while, but I'd argue that it's more like a BuJo with only two spreads: a chosen monthly spread and a long list spread, maybe less "pimped" and more "stripped bare, and rebuilt". The question I'm wondering is whether this has worked well or not for people, and whether anyone has actually tried it or not.</div>

<div class="content">Nothing definitive yet. I have a 1 day 1 page planner for use next year, so we'll see what I decide to do with it by then.</div>
