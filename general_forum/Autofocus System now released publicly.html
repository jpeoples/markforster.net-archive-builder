<div class="content">I've come to the conclusion that the original Autofocus instructions got it right first time. So I have now put them on this website open to everyone. <br><br>See <a href="http://www.markforster.net/autofocus-system/" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/autofocus-system/</a><br><br>You are welcome to pass this link on to anyone without registration. Please note however that the text is fully copyrighted and that the text itself may not be copied or passed on.<br><br>Many thanks to everyone who has tried the system and commented on it. It's thanks to your efforts and many comments that I have made the above decision. You are of course welcome to continue discussing the system and commenting on it on this Forum.<br><br>Over the next few days, I will be adding translations in other languages than English. Many thanks to those who have prepared these translations.</div>

<div class="content">Mark<br><br>In a blog entry a year ago you stated:<br><br>"I’ve always seen myself as someone whose main calling is to experiment, rather than to find one answer which I then write about for evermore. The problem with experimenting is that by its very nature more experiments go wrong than go right. But one of life’s lessons is that it’s only by being willing to be wrong that you can discover the right answers.<br><br>Towards the end of last year I was beginning to feel that I really am making some positive progress. You will probably be able to judge by the quantity and quality of postings on this blog over the next few months whether the new ideas are actually working, or whether it will have to be back to the drawing board again."<br><br>Taking your own criteria, and any other you care to mention, AutoFocus can only be seen as a resounding success.  THANK YOU!  I think you can truly consider that you are to Time Management what Thomas Edison was to light bulbs! :-)<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Nice that you are sharing this system with everyone now :) A bit funny for me cause I've subscribed for beta yesterday, received email with instructions late at night  and today system is public already ;)<br><br>Still it looks like great system - I'm using it for a day and I like it already. I had empty ruled moleskine reporter notebook and no idea what  to use it for...now I know - AF system.  It has 22 lines so I guess almost perfect for me :)<br><br>I've added only one change instead of only crossing items I also highlight finished items with green and dismissed with orange/red ...this way I easily see which page is finished and which items still to do :)<br><br>Thanks for sharing AF with us !</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Mark!<br><br>I find the description of "Continue going round the same page" not very clear and <br>I'm missing a clarification that was made in the forum somewhere.<br>What is correct?<br>a) After I cross of an item, do I go back to step one of the process (fast reading, slow reading, ...) of the same page?<br>b) After I cross of an item, do I continue slow reading after the crossed of item?<br>c) After I cross of an item, do I continue slow reading from the beginning of the page?<br><br>Thanks for any clarification, as I'm unsure what to do at the moment.</div>

<div class="content">Hmmm. Without thinking about it I assumed (b) 'continue slow reading after the crossed item'<br><br>However, now you raise the question - I can see some value in (c) 'continue slow reading from the beginning of the page' - as I might now find one of the previous items on the page attracts my attention for imidiate action.<br><br>I wonder how others have been handling this part of the protocol?<br><br></div>
