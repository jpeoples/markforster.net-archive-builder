<div class="content">I've been pondering the fact that No-List systems tend to lead to the natural emergence of new routines and support systems. I was wondering how and why that happens. I have a tentative theory, based on my experience with Serial No-List.<br><br>With Serial No-List (and with No-List systems in general), the only things that appear on your list are the things that are top-of-mind. They are top-of-mind because they represent some strong interest, aspiration, or pressure. <br><br>Let's consider the things that are generating pressure, stress, or fear. Maybe these are one-off items that represent some urgent task. The task is handled, and it is removed from the list. No problem.<br><br>But let's say it doesn't go away so easily. Maybe it's some persistent problem, or a persistent backlog. It keeps re-appearing on your list. These are the things that represent some kind of system failure, or at least inadequacy. They keep pressing upon you because you aren't handling them as well as you could. If you were handling them well, they would be handled automatically, and you wouldn't even need to think about them. Or maybe you'd enter them and quickly cross them off and they don't really bother you (like the one-off urgent items mentioned above).<br><br>This is a great feature of no-list systems -- the biggest problems naturally float to the top and appear on your list and must be dealt with. Serial No-List amplifies this effect, because if you don't deal with those items, they will keep appearing on your list, over and over again, till you finally deal with them.<br><br>And sometimes it's pretty amazing how No-List handles them. Because they are always top-of-mind, your mind is often working on how to solve these problems, even if it's below your conscious awareness. And sometimes, the solution just suddenly appears. You can make some small change to your daily routine, and the persistent backlog disappears. You can re-arrange a few things on your desk, and the persistent pile of papers disappears. New habits form. <br><br>It doesn't *always* work out like this, but it's happened to me many times. And the problems that don't spontaneously fix themselves usually start bothering me enough that I am persuaded to set aside some time and really try to find a solution -- finally fix the problem for good. <br><br>As a result, those problem items are no longer top-of-mind. They just get taken care of automatically, usually without me writing anything on the list at all. They just become habits. And I think this explains (at least partially) why no-list systems usually don't feel so dominated by recurring items. Recurring items still appear on the list sometimes, but they are generally handled quickly and then recede into the background until you intuitively know they need your attention again. But sometimes they just don't appear at all. They just get handled. <br><br>Has anyone else experienced this kind of thing with No-List or Serial No-List?</div>

<div class="content">This is food for thought, but my implementation of no-list seems to preclude automatic routine such as you suggest. My rule 1 is “do nothing unwritten”.  Perhaps explain how this works in your case?</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br>I intend to try Serial No-List sometime soon. But in the meantime I have been concentrating on getting the most possible out of a Long List scenario. In fact my one incursion into No-List resulted in my crashing out of the Challenge on Day 2 no less!<br><br>However the advantages you give of Serial No-List are also in my experience to be found in a Long List scenario. Habit and routines form, new ways of doing things suddenly appear, problems one is avoiding get highlighted.</div>

<div class="content">Alan Baljeu - <br><br><< My rule 1 is “do nothing unwritten”. Perhaps explain how this works in your case? >><br><br>The more I use Serial No-List, the more I find myself trusting my intuition in-the-moment to find the right things to do, even without the help of the system.<br><br>This is especially true at home, where there is a lot more stuff just standing there, waiting to be done (dishes to be washed, children needing attention, etc.). Most Saturday mornings, for example, I just focus on whatever seems to need attention. <br><br>But sometimes there are more intangible things pulling at me (like filing my tax return, setting up the new monthly budget, buying tickets for vacation, etc.). So in a case like that, I'd open my Serial No-List and write down whatever is on my mind and see what stands out. <br><br>There are other times when I begin by going with wherever my intuition is taking in-the-moment, but then find myself wandering, or pulled a bit in too many directions. That's another indication I should turn to my notebook, write it all down, and follow the process to sort it out.<br><br>At work, it often happens that I start the day by scanning my calendar, reminders, and unread mail. Then I turn to my Serial No-List and start writing down whatever is on my mind -- whatever "current initiatives" I am thinking about, any urgent items or deadlines, ideas that I've been pondering during the morning commute, etc. Other times, I have a lot on my mind, so I start with Serial No-List and check the calendar only after I've done my initial brain-dump. <br><br>So I suppose my (unwritten) rule 1 is almost the opposite of yours -- only write it down when I really need to -- when I need help figuring out what to do. I suppose this means my core system is really something like "follow my intuition", and the Serial No-List is a supplement and guide to help me do that when I have trouble doing it on my own.</div>
