<div class="content">I'm a manager. I have 5 directs and 40 people under them. I have lots of 'distractions' from them and our clients. And lots of meetings as consequence. I love AF but it's very difficult to find time for working it out :) So I'm afraid my list grows and some items become urgent. Do you have any tips for that situation? Maybe I need to scan the whole list daily in the morning to put some items into the calendar?</div>

<div class="content">Hi John,<br><br>I too have many days with back-to-back meetings all day.  The amount of work coming in does not slow down, nor does email.  I have a catergory in tasks in Outlook called "Due!".  Projects and tasks that have strict timelines and hard due dates are listed in there.  I can clearly see in my calendar what things are going to have to take precedence.<br><br>I also block off time in my calendar as much as I can strictly for Autofocus 4.  I have found this combined approach still harnesses the power of AF4, but allows me to deal with urgent and hard due-date items.  <br><br>And then, of course, is the work that just shows up and is important and urgent.  In these cases, I just do it.  As Mark has said, we have to use our common sense with AF -- if something lands in your lap and needs to be done now, or today....then just do it.<br><br>I hope this helps.  Let me know how you get along....<br><br>Best regards,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">John:<br><br>No time management system is going to solve the problem of having so many distractions and meetings that you are unable to find time to doing the rest of your work. You have got to make time somehow. That is above all an organizational question.</div>

<div class="content">It looks like I have to schedule the NO-meetings time. Not a very good approach as there could be some urgent things to solve daily which could again cancel that AF time. Anyway I will try.</div>

<div class="content">John:<br><br>Trying isn't really going to solve the problem. You need to address it head on. The problem is that you have work which requires discretionary time, and you don't have the discretionary time to deal with it. You have therefore either 1) to cut down the work which requires the discretionary time or 2) make space for it by reducing the non-discretionary work. <br><br>Assuming 1) is not realistic then I suggest you look closely at the two factors you mentioned:<br><br>"Distractions" - Why are there so many distractions? Can you work out better systems which won't result in your being interrupted the whole time? Are you allowing everyone to interrupt you at any time *they* feel like it? If so, is this a sensible policy? Can you devise a better one? If you have 45 people under you, how come you are always the one being interrupted?<br><br>Meetings - Are all the meetings strictly necessary? Could some of them be done just as well by email, conference call, etc? Do they all have a stated aim and a timed agenda? And remember that the whole purpose of meetings is produce work - so time must be left to do that work.</div>
