<div class="content">Is this a good or bad idea?  I think it's good.  It's only a strategy: use it while it helps, change when it hurts. <br><br>Have exactly one unfinished task. Choose any task of high value that you want to really progress.<br>Work this task in bursts of energy.  Pomodoros if you like.  Or just go until you are slowing, figure what must be next in the project, and stop. Or go until something interrupts you, and stop. Reenter next page.<br>All C1 tasks are do-a-little tasks only. Pick only one and do it.  Do something urgent, if any.<br>Turn the page. <br><br>By this strategy you should be moving forward 2 pages an hour, or at least one an hour, and you'll pass through the list twice a day or more.  The important project will be done very quickly.  And all those so-called urgent things won't clog up the system because you will easily get to them in time: (write them bold to stand out when you reach them) <br><br>Don't forget to include Break type tasks.</div>

<div class="content">I think this touches on the general principle that Mark has been talking about at length -- for example, here:  <a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2011/2/18/end-of-testing-superfocus-v-3.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2011/2/18/end-of-testing-superfocus-v-3.html</a><br><br>But here's a question.  How will any of the C1 tasks become your next largish unfinished C2 project, if all your C1 tasks are "do-a-little tasks only"?</div>

<div class="content">Yes, good question, Seraphim!</div>

<div class="content">Not the response I expected. The question seems to come from a poor phrasing of my scheme.   <br><br>When I first put something in, it's a quick note that it or something like it should maybe perhaps be done sometime somehow.  I don't have anything near specifying how it should be worked on. That definition only comes After I commit to doing something.<br><br>So I choose whether I want to tackle the task as a focus, or bit-at-a-time when I commit. I never imagined doing otherwise.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Alan,<br><br>I'm still not sure I understand what you are saying.  <br><br>On one hand, C1 includes only "do-a-little tasks".<br><br>On the other hand, C1 includes only tentative items -- "it's a quick note that it or something like it should maybe perhaps be done sometime somehow. I don't have anything near specifying how it should be worked on."    They may be small, they may be large -- "That definition only comes After I commit to doing something."<br><br>Maybe you really have a mixture of both of these:  some clearly defined, small tasks ("feed the dogs") together with some tentative tasks that may or may not become large tasks ("get a new dog?").  <br><br>Here is how I understand your proposal:<br><br>+ In C1, enter only (a) clearly defined small tasks and (b) vaguely defined tasks.<br><br>+ Keep one unfinished task in C2.  <br><br>+ When you turn to a new page, you should work on your unfinished C2 task (for no more than 1 pomodoro = ~30 minutes) and you should also work on one C1 task (for no more than 1 pomodoro = ~30 minutes).  This C1 task should be, in order of preference, (a) a small urgent task, or (b) a small task.  In this way, you will spend no more than 1 hour on a page -- and likely less than that.<br><br>+ This will allow you to move quickly through your list.<br><br>+ Since you are moving quickly through your list, there is no need to enter urgent things into C2.  Just keep them in C1.  When you come to a new page and you choose your C1 item to work on, that's the time to choose one of those urgent items on that page, if there are any.<br><br>+ When you finish your C2 task, choose one of the vaguely-defined tasks in C1 to take its place.  Define exactly what you intend to accomplish and write that in C2 on the next page.  If there are other aspects of that C1 task you want to deal with later, re-enter that C1 task in C1 at the end of the list also.<br><br><br>Did I summarize your proposal correctly?</div>

<div class="content">A summary should be shorter than the source! My suggestion was not supposed to be complicated. It's not intended as a rule but a guideline.   Your  last paragraph would be a good summary, and the rest is unneeded. <br><br>My summary:<br>Write whatever you like, no rules.  Aim to have extemely few tasks in column 2, so they get done fast. When you pick a C1 task, that's when you decide whether to focus on it, Finish it quickly, or just do a little bit and set it aside again.</div>
