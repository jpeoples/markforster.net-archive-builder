<div class="content">Like some others, I'm also intrigued by the Kanban approach.. After dabbling with it last year in an online version, I think I still prefer the manual, whiteboard,sheet of paper, back of the door approach.<br><br>Right now I'm fighting to complete key tasks before I leave Damascus on Thursday for an extended break (all right, 'right now' I'm typing this post!).<br><br>I've put each task on a small Post-it slip (50mm x 35mm), stuck the waiting ones down the left hand side (plastic frame) of my notebook screen, the current one at the top, the finished ones on the right (only one so far).<br><br>Very visual, seems to be helping, I think I'll try it again when I need to focus on my notebook screen and limit distractions.</div>

<div class="content">Sticking postits on the monitor is a popular taskmanagement system. It breaks down when you run out of space on the borders of your monitor.   (Many jobs have no problem with that.). <br><br>If you extend your space, say by using an adjacent wall for backlog, people have made that work.</div>

<div class="content">This sounds like a good idea for you this week. Today I really had to get some progress on some tasks for a particular customer. I just wrote down exactly what I wanted to get done today and am crossing them off as I go along. Seems to be working.<br><br>As we said elsewhere - the simplest systems are the best quite often!</div>

<div class="content">I agree the software kanban are slow to use. I had a thought I wanted to put in my portable notebook kanban (a la Erik's I Source system) but the notebook was in the other room. So I wrote it on a half inch post it flag and stuck it one the side of my monitor, nice and visual.</div>

<div class="content">I'm liking this as a 'Super Focus' way to stop my attention drifting, a bit like Gerry's Three Tasks approach.<br><br>Maybe one way to implement SFv3 is to write the Column 2 tasks on these small Post-its (use a right hand page in a Moleskine Large notebook?), then peel them off and place on the left-hand side of the screen, or just do them!<br><br>I've never used flags and Post-Its a lot.  I thought their main use with monitors was as a password reminder, and no, I have never used them for that ;-))</div>
