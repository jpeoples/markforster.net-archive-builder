<div class="content">I have tried Autofocus again and it still doesn't 'fit' with me at all.  I can not get myself motivated enough to tackle the tasks that do stand out.   It is odd, but with DIT and having a daily list if I tackle just one item it feels like progress is being made.  Before long most of the items are done and anything that is left I actually feel like doing with the aim of clearing the list for the day.  I find the feeling of the list getting smaller is motivational - well helps me to stay motivated.  <br><br>Autofocus I think requires a certain amount of self motivation that I just can't seem to summon.  Avoidance tactics start to take hold with me - like spending more time entering new items than addressing existing items.  Because for whatever reason I can not get zoned in on the method - duplicate items start to appear excessively.   Not because of the system - but because of my failings in working the system.<br><br>All in all I would just say I appear to have a sort of mental block with this method of working. That is not to say the system is at fault - because in all logical sense I can see how the method is suppose to work.  So I find it slightly annoying that it doesn't work for me, especially as it suits so well an electronic implementation in MyLifeOrganized (MLO).<br><br>On the bright side I would say DIT does really suit me - and one thing I noticed immediately when switching back was how at ease I was just in myself.  It didn't take long via DIT to get everything in order and shipshape.   I feel more relaxed and I think the structure of DIT just suits my personality type.<br> <br>All the best<br> <br>Steve<br></div>

<div class="content">Steve:<br><br>"I can not get myself motivated enough to tackle the tasks that do stand out."<br><br>It doesn't sound as if you have got the hang of what "standing out" means. A task which stands out should feel as if it's ready to be done, as if any resistance to doing it has evaporated. So to say that you can't get yourself motivated to tackle them doesn't make sense. <br><br>Standing out is quite different from an intellectual sense that the task needs to be done.</div>

<div class="content">Steve, I am currently experimenting with an AF-DIT hybrid that is working brilliantly for me so far. I could see it being very appealing to you as well. I need a couple more days to test it and then I will post. I would like to see what you think of it.<br><br>In the meantime, Mark may be right about the definition of "standing out." I spent a lot of time trying to determine what was most important to put on my DIT list because that was all I planned to do the following day. If you apply the same mindset to AF, it doesn't work. Because of the pressure not to have to dismiss a task, you end up doing the truly important tasks and the rest get left on inactive lists. Unlike other time management systems, there isn't any guilt about dismissing the tasks. You've made a decision the easy way! Those items aren't important or you would have done them.</div>

<div class="content">Things stand out – but resistance for me is never gone at that point.  I resist things up until the point they are complete.  That is when resistance for me has gone.  There are very few things I do without some form of resistance at play – which links I think to being a chronic procrastinator.  Only the things I truly love doing have no resistance – everything else is a struggle.</div>

<div class="content"><br>Mark, could you little bit more elaborate "standing out"? <br>Is it just when you "like to do it" vs. "you don't like" or?<br></div>
<h2>Reply by Christine B</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-02-2 12:06</div>
<div class="content">Steve<br><br>As Mark says above "A task which stands out should feel as if it's ready to be done, as if any resistance to doing it has evaporated." The "standing out" with AF is very different to what you are describing - but in itself is hard to explain because it is basically a "feeling".<br><br>To try to explain that "feeling" - for example, I may be sitting at my desk working and suddenly think "I feel like a cup of coffee".  The ability to make that cup of coffee or the availability of the tools to make it have not altered - the only thing that has changed is that I suddenly "feel like a cup off coffee" or in AF terminology that desire is "standing out".  If I had a list with "coffee" on it, sometimes I would "feel like" having a cup of coffee and sometimes I wouldn't. Resistance would not even come into the equation - obviously I could choose whether or not to act on that "feeling" - AF would encourage you to do so.<br><br>That "feeling" has little to do with a rational response - or to outside curcumstances.  The effect of outside circumstances may influence our action but NOT the feeling.  If I have someone coming round for coffee I will make coffee, drink it, and no doubt enjoy it.  Whether or not I feel like it is, at that point, largely irrelevant.  The action of that task in that scenario is, in effect, a scheduled task.  I may or may not feel like it - but I will do it because it is a scheduled task.<br><br>Suppose I am working at my desk and someone telephones me and asks me whether I want to go to the cinema.  Regardless of whether I am busy there will be an immediate involuntary subconscious response - I will either "feel like" going or I will not.  Whether I can realistically go is irrelevant - the reasons for wanting to go or not, for this scenario are irrelevant.  What is important is that "feeling".  THAT is what you are looking for with AF.<br><br>It sounds bizarre (and frankly feels quite bizarre) but under AF you do find yourself "feeling" like doing things you would not expect to feel like doing.  That is the amazing beauty of the system - that it does somehow create the environment by which you "feel" like doing the things you have previously procrastinated on.  If you continue to feel immense resistence to things I would venture to suggest that that has nothing to do with procrastination but rather is an indication that either you do not subconsciously wish to do the item concerned or that you are trying to enforce a "rational" timeframe upon the item.<br><br>Going back to the cinema analogy - if I were to feel that I didn't want to go then there would be a reason - maybe I want to do something else, maybe I don't want to see the film that's on, maybe I hate cinema's.  Whatever the reason the feeling itself is what is valid - AF, by it's dismissal policy enables us to look at the reason for "not feeling like doing" something. With regard to the coffee analogy - it may be that I have put it on my list because it is "the thing to do" but I hate coffee and therefore will never in any shape or form "feel" like doing it.  However, I like tea, so I can rephrase the task as "make tea" or even just "get a drink".  Now when I see that task the resistance has vanished ...... <br><br>Obviously those are very simplistic examples but i hope that helps in some way - Dean that may also answer some of your question?     <br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Steve<br>I fully understand your point.  To me, the autofocus list is identical to my master list.  I plan weekly from it....both my responsibilities and some of my pleasures with plenty of flex time to handle the unpredictable stream of life's emergencies, opportunities, health, moods, etc......I, too, prefer to keep current with meeting my responsibilities and progressing on my major goals with planning and "making" myself get the stuff that causes resistance out of the way as soon into the day as possible.  Then I can peacefully attend to what "stands out"....i.e. engage in discretionary activities with no looming or dreaded tasks polluting my mood or focus.<br>And, yes.....I make myself do them because I want to get them off the day's horizon ASAP!  I can't really feel at ease or creative with dreaded scut work looming ahead.  For me, I separate the two to the best of my ability.  Everybody has things they don't particularly like to do but they "want to" to uphold their responsibilities, uphold their reputation and meet their goals despite some sticking points.  Some folks like to wait until URGENCY motivates them.  Some folks like to alternate them with more desirable activities.  And some folks like to them them out of the way to peacefully enjoy the rest of their day or to free up their creativity.  I'm sure I'm like that because that's what I've been doing for over half a century!  LOL!  I've had to modify my ways to accomodate my disabilities...but, bottom line, my brain prioritizes the same as it always has.....call it cultural guilt or naked ambition.....I'm guilty of a bit of both.<br>I only refer to my master list when my planned work is done...or I'm intentionally creating a short break from my short list!  LOL!  I could never rely on myself to "feel like" doing dreaded or boring stuff unless I allowed it to lapse into a state of urgency.  I don't like that method at all....too much nagging in my brain and it splinters my focus. I would call my system a blend of scheduling, planning and following the cues of the day when my planned work is complete enough to my satisfaction.  Rarely, must I do many same day tasks that aren't habitualized checklist items.  We all operate in our own perceived comfort zone.  I totally understand what you're saying.  I don't want to wait until I feel like it for important work.  There's comfort and surety in planned work....and freedom when it's done!  LOL!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">In addition to Christine's excellent post I'd say that for me that socalled 'standing out feeling' isn't an emotion but more a kind of physical self-perception. <br>It's a change in breath-rhythm , a change of muscle tension in my shoulders or the upper belly, that makes me notice whether a task 'goes with me' ('stands out')  right here and right now, or not. <br>Most people would simply call it 'gut feeling'.<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Rainer<br>Scut work never stands out for me unless it's lapsed into urgency.......it's easier on me to simply work the plan to get it done regardless of what I feel  or whether I'm ready.  It removes most of the wiggle room precisely because my aim is to get rid of it ASAP.  Some things I'll never feel fuzzy or ready for and when I'm in enough pain, I need to press myself the same way.  I little bit of effort keeps my discipline in good shape.  There's nothing wrong with using it to get my stuff done ASAP.  I don't see the harm in this at all. Once I'm done, I'm glad for grunting it out!  LOL!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Hi Steve<br>p.s.  Remember the "keep starting and finishing will take care of itself" mantra.  There's no sin in not liking to do all that you're responsibile for or getting past sticking points with your goals.  I'm not going to feel bad that I need to apply discipline to get myself to do stuff that I'll never choose to do because I "feel" ready or in the mood.  Sometimes we simply do what needs to be done regardless of mood....even if it's a series of starting it. Several starts to completion beats out disregarding it if it's important to you for whatever the reason.<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">learning as I go<br><br>I do understand your point about the need for discipline and structure in some areas and it is very evident that a lot of people really thrive on that element of structure.  For me that has always been a major problem - I love organisation, I love the concept of structure, it's just that somehow I link that structure in Time Management with a sense of duty.  The result was that I always felt I needed to get those "duty" items out of the way before I could do what "I" wanted.  The result of course was that there were always those duty items and by trying to get them out of the way (in other words getting to the point of having an empty to do list!) I was *never* getting to what I *wanted* to do.  Even if I did I felt I "ought" to be doing something else.  It felt as if life was passing me by - I could see everyone else having fun but I had "all this stuff to do".  That very structure, which was designed to free my time, actually became the thing that trapped me.<br><br>I'm certainly not saying that is true for everyone - clearly it isn't - just that that was how I was feeling about my previous "to do" type lists, regardless of the system used.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Steve, maybe it's a possibility that, simply put, AF does not meet your particular needs and/or circumstances as well as another system may do. This does not mean that you are lacking some sort of ability to 'get it' or have failed in any way,  but that you give it a try and it does not suiit you. Maybe that's all there is to it. <br><br>In relation to Mark's point about resistance and your job, I believe there will always be some aspects (however minor) to a job role and that is probably an inescapable reality - unless of course you can design every single aspect of your job. In these circumstances I have found that the best way for me to deal with these tasks, in practical terms, are just to get them crossed off the list ASAP.</div>

<div class="content">Rainer<br><br>You are absolutely right about gut feeling - which is also virtually impossible to describe.  I was giving that some thought over lunch (which I suddenly felt like - or was it a gut feeling)? :-)  It actually made me realise that for me there is a slight difference between the two and it made me question what that difference was and more importantly perhaps whether it mattered in this context.  To answer the second question question first I don't think it makes any difference in the AF context as to whether the item stands out by a feeling (emotion) or by gut instinct.  The important thing is to recognise the item standing out.  <br><br>Questioning what that difference was really opened up a whole new concept on AF for me but I haven't posted in detail because it's getting into quite a philosophical area and I wouldn't want to confuse the importance of how items stand out.<br><br>Maybe I should content myself with writing it up as an article to post on my website if I ever get it up and running - the next stages of that task haven't yet stood out for me yet!<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Steve, I think it's great that you came to this realization: " I feel more relaxed and I think the structure of DIT just suits my personality type." Also, I relate to this other statement of yours, which has been true for me at times: "Only the things I truly love doing have no resistance – everything else is a struggle." (In my case it had/has to do with health issues.)<br><br>In terms of things "standing out" and resistance lessening, it reminds me of Marilyn Paul's idea of "getting to ready." While clearly for me some things "get to ready" (ie no resistance left; ready and able and willing and maybe even enthusiastic! to do the task) by a completely subconscious process, I wonder if others are having even more success in this area, by reviewing or planning *more consciously* when they go through their AF lists?? <br><br>For example, when you go through your lists, are you breaking a line item into subtasks in your head, or perhaps visualizing its completion or its starting point? Are you maybe imagining what it will feel like to have something done? Are you "thinking past" a particular task (eg, "I'll just work on this less-preferred task, like my taxes, so I can get to that next thing on the list I really want to do, like have a cup of tea.") or thinking how the task might be reworded, to be more palatable?? Just wondered what others might be doing *in their heads* that is helping the resistance? <br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark<br><br>Yes, it's been quite an interesting thing for me to experience, never having posted on a forum like this before.  I started writing a book a while ago and realise now that it was the very act of writing that was moving the thoughts and ideas forward.  It's strange but I had always believed that writing "should" flow easily, and although I was familiar with the concept of writers' block have found the posts on the writing thread very interesting and thought provoking.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-02-2 18:18</div>
<div class="content">Hi Bev<br><br>Just a comment on the last para of your post above. When I review my tasks I action the next task that stands out but find that, and particularly noticeably where the task is pretty mindless, my mind is continuing to work automatically on the other tasks - the Autofocus aspect of it I guess.  I'm not necessarily intending to think about other tasks, but find my sub-conscious if you like, does seem to working on them and that ideas about how to action or break up a task are just presenting themselves automatically, or I will "just know" what the next is that I want to do and how to do it.  The resistance issue clears itself in that way, because by the time I reach the previously resisted item I may well have already "found" the reason for, or a solution to, that resistance.<br><br>I would try not to act on the principle of "just doing the less preferred task" to get it out of the way, because experience is teaching me that there will be a point that it will in fact  become "the preferred" task and so be able to be done a lot more easily than if I "just get it out of the way".</div>

<div class="content">Hi, Christine<br>You're giving me far too much credit by implying that I ever complete everything I feel compelled to do!  LOL!  No way!  That's why I work a system.  I've habitualized regular items into regular cycles.  When I've done what today demands, it doesn't matter about the rest of my life.  Unless I'm intentionally freeing up some future time, I only do today's requirements and aims....and I always provide myself with plenty of latitude.  I'd drive myself stark raving mad if I spent all my time futilely attempting to clear all my responsibilities.  Life is cyclic....so are responsibilities, goals and pleasure.  The day usually allows for generous heaping of appreciating your day.<br>I like getting the stuff out of the way precisely because I cherish my freedoms and my creativity.  My focus also benefits from a system of daily portions....not habitually trying to do it all!  LOL!  Unless it's necessary, (rarely) I'll never volunteer myself to do more scut work than absolutely necessary to meet my own standards.....not even one iota more than I deem necessary!  LOL!  <br>I simply don't do as well when I'm feeling the drag of dread!  LOL!  I've always been a proponent of jumping into the cold ocean in one go so that I can get to the joy sooner.

<div class="content">learning as I go<br><br>I admire the fact that you COULD get stuff out the way - I seemed to have such an inbuilt resistance that, unless I was virtually at gunpoint with a deadline, my productivity would just get less and less.  Even with DIT, I may only have had one item left on my list but would resist it to the point of almost going backwards.  That's not to say I didn't do anything, but for whatever reason the degree of resistance and procrastination created an unbelievable amount of stress - obviously something going on in my subconscious .........:-)</div>

<div class="content">@Mark <br><br>I will give you an example to try and explain things further.<br><br>I love fixing computer problems; in fact there isn’t a problem I can’t either resolve or workaround.   When faced with this type of task all of the skills that hinder me in normal day to day things, come to the forefront. Things like whole system thinking, logic, attention to detail and analytical thinking etc.  I can get so much into the zone when dealing with an issue that I can suffer easily from hyper-focus, and then I forget to eat, sleep etc.  It is like all consuming at the time, because I love that part. Finding out how things tick and what stops them from ticking :)<br><br>On the flip side to this, when the work is done then to me the mundane/tedious aspects come into play.   I have to raise an invoice for the work that I have done – I don’t like this part.  I like doing the work; I don’t like doing the admin. But obviously this is an important aspect, but even though I know and realise the importance. I never feel like doing it, I never want to do it and given a choice I would much sooner do something else.<br><br>Here is where DIT wins through for me.  I do the work today, then as a matter of process I put on tomorrow’s list ‘Raise invoice for xyz’.  In today, do tomorrow.  The process in itself is now almost automated.  Because I am not going to do anything with it until tomorrow, it is out of my mind and I don’t dwell on it.  It is now a planned action for tomorrow.  Tomorrow my aim/goal/target is to clear my list – that is where I aim my focus. It really isn’t something I need to think anything more about, it is on the list. I aim to at least attempt its completion. <br><br>Autofocus on the other hand – ‘Raise invoice for xyz’ gets added to the end of the list.  Now I don’t have a daily aim/goal/target – it is left to my own intuition.  Here I know ‘Raise invoice for xyz’ is important it will leap out at me. But I don’t like doing that part and the process ‘in today/do tomorrow’ is no longer at play.  So it will not get done because I don’t enjoy that part and I can not summon enough enthusiasm, left to my own devices, to address this area. In a way DIT puts the process on Autopilot for me – Autofocus allows me time to think.  Time to think builds resistance because I think of all the reasons not to do something.<br></div>

From my experience with AF so far I would have no problem with putting that task on a schedule and doing it "tomorrow".  If your "project management system" is such that you raise an invoice the day after completing the work then it would be part of your procedures to raise that invoice on the following day, i.e. at a scheduled time. If you put it on your schedule, and always action your scheduled items, that will deal with that type of scenario.<br><br>What I would suggest though is that you look at your overall administration and whether this is something you can outsource.  You may not feel able to do that at present but I would imagine that your hourly rate is higher than you would expect to pay for administration services.  Sometimes we fight our own systems when the solution is to delegate the task full stop.  In the interim, or as an alternative, it should be easy enough to set up your system to virtually produce your invoices automatically.  If you use a suitable accounts package invoice creation for the type of work you do could be almost instantaneous once set up.<br><br>One trick to review your current procedures is to treat yourself as your own client - imagine someone coming to you and saying "I need a solution to .......".  Planning for that other person is always easier because you are not emotionally tied to the problem.</div>

<div class="content">Dear Steve:<br><br>I sympathise with the example you gave because I used to have an enormous resistance to sending out invoices myself. <br><br>In fact the answer to my problem was the one that Christine suggests. Invoicing is the one part of my business that I outsource. Life is so much easier because I am not having to force myself to do something that I hate.<br><br>As the saying goes: "Don't try to teach pigs to fly. You won't succeed, and you'll annoy the pigs".</div>

<div class="content">Steve, I am interested to see if you find the AF / DIT hybrid I just posted about appealing. It has really revolutionized the way I handle tasks other than those I must/should do on a daily scheduled basis. I am trying to find a solution for dealing with the resistance I have to these other tasks now that the rest of my task management is going so well. I need to find a way to reduce my feeling of obligation about these other tasks so I can get on with it! And yes Mark, I really have to do them! LOL If I don't my husband may divorce me and my kids might, too. ;-)</div>
