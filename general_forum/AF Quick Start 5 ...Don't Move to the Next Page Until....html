<div class="content">I have a question regarding not moving on to the next page and "Dismissed Items."  <br><br>AF Quick Start Step 5 says "Continue going round the same page in the same way. Don't move onto the next page until you complete a pass of the page without any item standing out"<br><br>Let's say I have something on a page that I *want* and/ or *need* to do, but physically *can't do* it because of current location or circumstances.  e.g. Finish a chapter in a book, but it's in a different location. Buy milk. Get a key made. Have the tires changed on the car, etc.<br><br>These items "stand out" for me, but I can't do anything about them right away.<br><br>What to do?  <br><br>If I dismiss the item, am I not  supposed to reenter it?  <br>If I *don't* dismiss the item, I'm *not* supposed to move on to the next page.<br><br>How do you handle these little to-dos/ eventualities?<br><br>Should I just "dismiss" them with a highlight and re-enter them continually until I get them accomplished?  If so, I foresee a whole little pile of tasks constantly at the end of my list.</div>

<div class="content">I'm just leaving items like that, as I know I can't do them now.  They don't stand out for me, but I don't dismiss them even if they're the only items left on the page.  I have no idea if that's the best way to handle them though.<br></div>

<div class="content">Ron:<br><br>I had worries about that when I was developing the system, but I found that in practice it wasn't a problem. <br><br>If the system is being worked properly, an unactioned item is probably going to remain on the page for a number of days. During that time there will be plenty of times when it could be done. Your mind will be aware of when the number of items on a page has got so low that a task is in danger of being dismissed if it is not done soon.<br><br>Therefore my conclusion is that if an item can't be done when it is the last item on a page it should be dismissed like any other task and not re-entered except under the usual conditions. It has had plenty of chance to be done.<br><br>I'm just a little worried from what you say that you think items should be dismissed if you don't do them the first time you visit a page. That is not the case. If you do think that please read the instructions again and my two Clarification blog postings.</div>

<div class="content">Yes, that is what I thought.  I read your clarification: "You only HAVE to do one item on each page..." <br>( <a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2009/1/6/clarification-speed-of-movement.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2009/1/6/clarification-speed-of-movement.html</a> )<br>and see that it's okay to have unactioned items (neither highlighted nor cross-out) on a page and move on.  <br><br>I'll "reboot" and try that.  <br><br>Thanks.</div>
