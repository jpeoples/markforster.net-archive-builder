<div class="content">Mark - it occurs to me that "no-list" is really the mythical system that people use who don't use systems (like your spouse and mine!).  It just comes to them naturally to be engaged with their work and follow the work, which is what no-list encourages.<br><br>Watching my wife—who is one of the hardest-working people I know and gets a tremendous amount of things done every day—she has a very rough calendar with appointments; makes rough ad-hoc lists whenever she needs them; a general schedule for the family that she mostly follows; but otherwise just does the work that needs doing.  Not everything gets done, but the important stuff does.  Plus she just gets SO MUCH done—and she's taught our kids to do the same.  The kids at high school and college level have needed some help tracking deadlines and details, and some of your systems have helped them with that—especially DIT—but they got their good working habits from my wife, not from me, that's for sure!<br><br>Anyway, from working the no-list way, I have started to feel I have more insights into what my wife just does naturally.  I am not sure exactly how to put that into words, but was wondering if you had any thoughts along these lines.</div>

<div class="content">Not Mark, but I remember after reading the FV instructions when it came out, I thought about the chain: "Cool, this way I can have a batch of tasks I would do in that order if I wouldn't work with a list!".</div>
