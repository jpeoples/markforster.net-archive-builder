<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-09-23 13:09</div>
<div class="content">Unclutterer has a piece today on "Qualities of a good To Do method" (<a href="http://unclutterer.com/2010/09/23/qualities-of-a-good-to-do-method/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://unclutterer.com/2010/09/23/qualities-of-a-good-to-do-method/</a> ) and Mark is linked as the first method.  Interestingly, though... I don't think she actually knows Mark's systems well since they don't actual adhere to a couple of her criteria.  ;^)</div>

<div class="content">Try <a href="http://unclutterer.com/2010/09/23/qualities-of-a-good-to-do-method/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://unclutterer.com/2010/09/23/qualities-of-a-good-to-do-method/</a><br>Interesting that this new article links to Mark's 2 year old blog posting on the initial prototype for AutoFocus, rather than the main AutoFocus system page, or something newer.</div>

<div class="content">I've corrected the link. It's important to make sure that a gap is left between the end of the link and any following punctuation marks.</div>
