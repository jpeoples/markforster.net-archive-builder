<div class="content">Hi everyone<br><br>here is the system I have been using for a while (more than two years) for time/delegation management. Parts of the system are surely inspired from Mark's systems and I thank him - and the rest of the participants- to share all theses ideas on this opened-mind forum. I hope this could be usefull for some of you.<br><br>This is  exclusively for Business (as Saturday and Sunday are used for tasks input, as you'll see).<br>The whole system is based on my intuition (decisions making) and flexible enough to handle any case, as it helps me as well as secure I works really on any task input into the system (whatever the work can be). <br>I think It is well fit to managers/directors (my case) but probably well fit as well for collaborators with no management.<br><br>Pascal<br><br>**Materials**<br>* paper agenda, one day one page (mine is provided by LECAS/TRAVERS one, costs around 4 euros in France)<br>* pen<br>* hiliters (I use a Blue and a Red one)<br>* brain (grey cells, Mr Poirot)<br><br>**Set up**<br>* beginning of a year (a little bit before), buy a "one day one page" agenda<br>* prepare the horizon (up to 2 weeks)<br>	* for each day, divide the page on two part (vertically)<br>	* on the left (where you can see the hours; you might switch to right if the hours are right aligned), I put scheduled activities (meetings, etc.); this the the **Scheduling Area**<br>	* on the right, a list of tasks where I put either 'tricker/events' (tasks/activities I have to tackle this specific day at a specific time slot) or tasks I want to perform this day (because of a due date, because of a recurrent tasks every Monday/Week/..., ...); this is the **Tasks area**<br>	* for the next 2week-end<br>		* next week-end (the first week-end after a week that is not started): I copy tasks from previous agenda and put a Red index (post it colored in red); this is the **Red WE** area<br>		* week-end after: Green index (post is colored in green); I'll refer this to **Green WE**<br>		* for instance this year: new year starts on a Saturday therefore the Red WE is on WE 8th and 9th of January where I did copy all remaining tasks of last year I knew won't be completed on 2010 and needed to be tackled in 2011) and Green WE the week after, 15th and 16th of January, empty as the beginning of the year.<br><br>**Working the system**<br>• any new task input goes to the Green WE<br><br>	* except if I know right now this is timestamped (scheduled or due date or...): see here before<br>	* except if urgent: week urgent > Red WE; day urgent: Day page, in Tasks Area<br>* each day, I tackle and work on ALL the tasks on the page of the day (if a task is worked and not completed, rewrite to Green Week-End or alternatively, to a day for recurring tasks, etc...)<br>	* It is impossible (not allowed) to let a task unworked; at the end ot each day, if there is still remaining items, I decide:<br>		* to postpone to Green WE, to postpone to Red WE if more urgent or I might decide to cancel it - no longer needed<br>* if timestill available, then I tackle the Red WE tasks <br>	* it is impossible (not allowed) to let a task unworked on the Red WE place at the end of the week (see Thursday review, here after); this gives me the strong message to complete its (at least works on its) during the current week<br>• each Thursday at the end of the day:<br>	* I review all tasks still remaining in the Red WE, to analyze if I will have time before the end of the week (ie the Friday) to complete it<br>	* if not possible and for each remaining tasks in the Red WE, I decide:<br>		* to postpone to Green WE if still important to perform and can wait the week or the week after<br>		* to postpone to a specific date of the next week; scheduled if necessary (eg need to discuss with somone); If very mandatory "alone" task, I book time in my agenda as "a meeting slot with me to do the job")<br>		* to cancel it (no longer needed)<br>	* then, <br>		* The Green WE now is marked RED week-end<br>		* and I put the Green mark to the week-end after<br><br>**Delegation and Management**<br>* usually, I have weekly meeting scheduled for each of my direct collaborators (monthly for other collaborators).<br>* when delegating during this weekly meeting, I put tasks on the specific named (of the collaborator) document (could be paper as well; I do digitally in ZIM tool); week after week, we follow the progress<br>* any new 'urgent' tasks (that can wait to the next weekly review with the collaborator) is put in my today page as a task: 'Ask TBN to do this'<br>	* When task is delegated:<br>		* if urgent for the day, I circle the name (TBN) to know that now TBN know he has to do it today<br>		* if less urgent, I rewrite the task either on anoter day of my agenda (TBN to do this)with TBN circled) if needed before next weekly review or I put it in the delegation  page (ZIM)<br>		* when due date is relatively far away fromp now, this is part of the qweekly review to understand with the collaborators how they are performing on their tasks<br>* for complex projects (IS projects, eg SAP implementation), we obviously use dedicated Project Management tools but some operational parts of its could be part of my time/delegation management system, when needed/appropriated<br> <br>**General rules I added **(because this is the way I want it to do; select your own tests)<br>• Never work more than half an hour on a task (if more time needed, this is a 'blocked' task > "scheduled meeting with me")<br>• Never more that 4 hours "real meetings" with people a day; when 4 hours or more, blocked the rest of the day for "scheduled meeting with me"<br>• for documents management; I use ZIM as a portable notes tool (any other tool likre evernote or what so ever will do the trick). Please don't consider to manage your tasks in this kind of tools (excepted for Delegation and Some Projects Management), rather use a separate and dedicated system (like the one I use).<br>• I used my hiliters to mark tasks worked (blue hiliter) and cancelled (red hiliter); any other way (cross the line, ...) could work as well; it depends on your brain/eyes way to interpret what your read</div>

<div class="content">Pascal,<br><br>thanks for your interesting post. If I got you right, you are using the pages of Saturday and Sunday (that will be empty anyway) to write some sort of "weekly focus list" that you use as guidance for your daily work?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Pascal,<br><br>Thank for your posting. One side question have you test to use this system with a FiloFax like tool ?<br><br>B.R<br>Henrik</div>

<div class="content">@Rainer<br><br>In a sense but not exactly: my paramount is the day closed list (tody page tasks), "à la DIT".<br>If completed, then I go through the Green WE list to tackle "à la AF1" the tasks. <br>Surely I want this list to be worked before the end the week ("à la DMW").<br><br>It means that when I add a new task in the RED WE (the one that will become the GREEN WE on the next Thursday night), I know have only -at a maximum- 14 days to do something on it (whatever it is as an action).<br><br>Hope this answer is clear enough. Let me know.</div>

<div class="content">@Henrik<br><br>well, I did'nt try with such tool,; I guess this is possible, as long as you don't use the "movable" leaf feature of the FiloFax to postpone the GREEN or RED WE areas (see previous answer to Rainer: my goal with this system is to secure I'm tackling any task in the next coming 2 weeks (including the current one).<br><br>Another advantage I see with an agenda: I can't loose pages! (well, the drawback is I can't have, around Christmas/Newyear periods, everything in "one" place and I have to carry two agendas for 2 to 4 weeks).</div>

<div class="content">Hi,<br><br>I start to apply your ideas in my personal system and I have one question.<br>Let say I have a task that need to be done - latest on wednesday -.<br>We are tuesday today and I have done all my task from today so I start to work on "red WeekEnd". Do you also work on task that are for tomorrow if they can be done today ?<br><br>Like do you do this task that at lastest on wednesday ( I put i on wednesday in my calendar )<br><br>Best Regards<br>Henrik</div>
<h2>Reply by Pascal</h2>
<div class="meta">2011-01-11 12:35</div>
<div class="content">@Henrik<br>several elements to answer your point.<br>1.if as task (we are Tuesday) is scheduled on Wednesday, it means I can't or won't start it before tomorrow, normally. This is never on a date page because of the latest due date  (saying that differently: I put a task directly on a date page when I want to start working on this task at this date, possibly because of dependencies). Therefore, I normally never tackle the tasks of tomorrow and later, only RED WE area and even GREEN WE area, if I have plenty of time (very rare!).<br>2. if I have a new task I know I have to achieve before Wednesday (or later), my intuition helps me in deciding if I put it on today page (à la DIT), under my today closed list, because this intuition leads me to consider I have a strong incentive to tackle it quickly (the weight of the task or the dependency to other persons is a strong incentive, for me, to tackle very quickly an activity) or if I put it on tomorrow (because the task is light, with no dependency)<br>3. It happened in the past (and will happen in the future) that my intuition was wrong, and I knew it because of another task/demand/request/remember arriving and telling me I have to accelerate this action: in that case, I tackled the task where it is and when finish, mark it as completed (using "my" system, it means: I might copy it again if not completed, today if urgent, tomorrow or in the RED WE if I can wait up to there, or even in the Green WE area if the first working achievement is sufficient to wait more than a week). All this based on intuition!<br><br><br>I hope I did answer your point. Let me know. And thanks for your interest in these ideas.</div>

<div class="content">@Pascal thanks for your answer<br><br>I will continue to use/test your ideas and will post my comment later.<br>What I like with this approach is that it works with my "online" tools very well.</div>

<div class="content">Hi,<br><br>@Pascal <br>I want to know how you handle the following "task". <br>We are wednesday today.<br>I send an email to someone and want to have an answer before next wednesday.<br><br>Where do you put this task ? <br>1- Wednesday <br>2- Red WE<br>3- Green WE ?</div>
<h2>Reply by Pascal</h2>
<div class="meta">2011-01-12 12:26</div>
<div class="content">"Henrik, stretch out with your feelings".<br><br>I assume you requested Wednesday as the latest due date to the email addressee. I assume as well you strongly need an answer by this date.<br><br>First, I would write the task something like this:<br>[TBN] Answer to email about turlututu<br><br>(the brackets are there to say that in my agenda I just circle completely the TBN, TBN = trigram of the person; turlututu is the subject/topic).<br><br>Now is the intuition part:<br>* if I trust this person, I'll put the task on next Wednesday directly<br>* if I half-trust this person, I might decide to put the task on let's say Monday then find a way to discuss about the topic with this person without directly asking/relaunching this person on the answer (diplomacy way to re-ask without being too demanding)<br>* if I don't trust this person, I'm going to put it on the RED WE area and secure I have an opportunity to liaise with him about my request (a little bit less diplomatic way)<br>If I decide the 2nd or 3rd option: I'll do the "double check" action then reenter it on Wednesday. <br><br>By the way: when I work on a task and it's not complete, when I reenter it (wherever), I add a point in front of it, each time. Therefore, a task with 3 points (for example) means I have worked previously three time on it. This adds some incentive on it.<br><br>Last point: you could say, I don't know this person.<br>Then, please call her/him (or better see her/him) to exchange about the request and why this is important for you (and your business). And trust that person (first experience).<br>I besides recommend to always try a phone/visual contact before leaving an email, in any circumstances.<br><br>I hope this will make sense for you.<br>Pascal</div>

<div class="content">Hi Pascal Thanks for you explanation. For me, the system is interesting because of the use of intuition coupled with a real following system and it's on paper. <br><br>It reminds me years ago when there was no computer but filofax and it worked very well. <br><br><br>I wonder something I imagin you have notes during your meetings and phone calls and even notes about your project or yours customers.... What kind of tool do you use ? another note book, a binder, a block of paper, a computer ? an ipad ? May be you use different tools when you are at your office and outside of it ?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jupiter<br><br>I mainly use ZIM when working alone (on my PC) and during some meetings  (like those with my collaborators), when/where people are used to this kind of tool. For all other situations, rather different ways depending on context and available tools; the idea is I scan/snapshot my notes in order to enter its in ZIM, when mandatory (some notes are just 'trashable'). Kind of tools:<br>* Paper on any form (flying leaves, pads, ...)<br>* whiteboards (and I then snapshot its with a camera)<br><br>For sure, I care about following actions/tasks (see my paper system).<br><br>As a summary:<br>* I prefer paper for actions/diaries<br>* I prefer electonic for notes (with TAGs usage), so that it is very easy to retrieve any note.<br><br>Regards<br>Pascal</div>

<div class="content">For notes, I am very fond of Evernote (www.evernote.com). Notes can be tagged, making your filing system very robust. On the desktop version, you can do ink notes for doodles. You can also store images (like Pascal's pictures of a whiteboard) as notes. Those image notes are even scanned with some pretty darn good OCR algorithms, so searching becomes very powerful. And all of your notes are stored in the cloud, so you never have to worry about syncing issues or drive failures. Everything is always accessible.<br><br>And it's free. :)</div>
