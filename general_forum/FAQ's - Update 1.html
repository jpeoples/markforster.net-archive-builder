<div class="content">Hi All<br><br>Here is the first update of helpful posts grouped by topic.  If anyone would like to add to the list please post below and I will include in next summary :-)<br><br>I think it is also worth posting Mark's comment on the common sense approach to using AF and dealing with urgent items - <br><br>"I know I talk about "trusting the system" and so on, but it is important to remember that the system is not some magic thing out there which tells us what to do completely unrelated to what our own personal views are!<br><br>The system is a framework designed to enable US to balance our rational and intuitive minds so we make BETTER decisions. It's still us in charge, and if we find that we are 15 pages away from an urgent item that has to be done in the next ten minutes, then for goodness sake JUST DO IT!! <br>January 11, 2009 at 12:41

<div class="content">You're a gem Christine.<br><br>I think handling recurring tasks deserves mention too. As well as discretionary time in relation to AF. (the amendments topic has some good points on this). Especially about Fine tuning AF (turn the dial as M put it). You might have linked this post somewhere in her already I reckon.<br><br>If M = Mark Forster...then Christine, you must be miss Moneypenny. Q = obviously Jacques. David Drake is Dr No. Who is James Bond? <br><br>(don't take me serious)<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Peter<br><br>Thanks for the additional suggestions.  I will make sure they are included in a later update.  There is some crossing over of subjects within the posts and it is helpful to know what people would be looking for terminology wise. <br><br>Actually I really had to laugh at your post 'cos I went out to lunch with friends today and we had an inevitable girlie discussion as to who is the best Bond - if I am Miss Moneypenny then I must surely be qualified to know...... :-)  The answer, outside of this forum of course, is obviously Pierce Brosnan! <br><br></div>

<div class="content">re: Mike<br>Ohhh Rosa Klebb, nasty! <br><br>Oddjob sounds like a task on my AF list.<br><br>I wonder how James Bond would handle AF. Tasks like "Save planet", "Hear Q out on new gadgets", "Kiss Bond girl", picking the ones that stand out. Hmm he'd have to enter new instructions from M at the end of the AF list. Tricky.<br><br>Re: Christine<br><br>How funny that you had a James Bond conversation that day. I had no idea that was a typical girlie topic! Even more surprising is your choice of the more modern Brosnan over Connery. Although I did like Brosnan in the role. Goldeneye was the best Bond (post-nineties, that is). But when push comes to shove...Connery = Bond. <br><br>:)<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Well Peter - I can see that we will just have to agree to differ :-)<br><br>Love the idea of JB's AF list - I guess if you have Oddjob on your AF list then that must put you in the running on the forum JB list .....!</div>

<div class="meta">2009-02-3 7:14</div>
<div class="content">wow Daniel Craig...surprising choices...<br><br>I was watching Roger Moore talk, he was asked how he differs from the new bond in terms of style. Moore said he was the lover and Craig the killer. He stated he was actually scared watching him on screen. I would concur, but that says a lot about how I (and Moore) can judge appeal...<br><br>I guess 'bad' boys are in. I would consider Connery old fashioned and bad (he loved to kill and would hit the occasional bond girl)...Roger Moore was a little silly and soft around the edges. Brosnan was more polished and modern as Bond, more metro...I guess much like in the Batman series where the darker portrayal has been a hit, so has Bond with Daniel. I know plenty who loved the Joker... *shrugs*<br><br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Peter, what have you started?<br><br>It's very interesting how TV & movies are protrying characters these days and there is a distinct move towards exploring the "tortured soul" of the hero in may instances.  Although it's not new (look at Shakespeare and King Lear) the treatment of characters has significantly progressed in the recent past and the James Bond films are actually an interesting study.  Connery's "badness" was treated quite light heartedly - he behaved badly but you forgave him - on the other hand with Timothy Dalton it somehow never worked - you never quite had the level of sympathy needed to understand him.  With Daniel Craig they seem to have been able to portray that side of him more realistically, ao tat you both understand and respect the character, whilst at the same time recognising that he is dangerous.  Pierce Brosnan on the other hand was treated more in the Roger Moore vein as the "lover not a fighter".</div>

<div class="meta">2009-02-3 12:42</div>
<div class="content">I'm just getting near to the end of re-reading the Richard Hannay stories by John Buchan. Most people have heard of "The Thirty-Nine Steps" but there are four further novels, each of which is better than the one before (in my opinion). They were written and are set in the period before, during and after the First World War.<br><br>When I first read the novels fifty years ago, there were still plenty of Richard Hannay hero-types around. I knew quite a few of them, though I often only found out how heroic they had been when I read their obituaries.<br><br>Nowadays everything he did, thought and said would be totally out of fashion, and quite a bit of it (like smoking a pipe in a pub, or hunting with dogs) illegal. <br><br>But I do wonder what he would have made of Autofocus!</div>
<h2>Reply by Christine B</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-02-3 13:20</div>
<div class="content">Well, only having read The Thirty Nine Steps (and watched the recent new dramatisation) I wonder when he would have been able to write his lists - his discretionary time seemed quite limited - there was the train journey I suppose ..........<br><br>And then would he have needed his notebook to be in code - and wouldn't he have had to have had some form of back-up system - I would imagine his notebook would be "requisitioned" every time he got captured ............?</div>
<h2>Reply by Mark Forster</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-02-3 23:00</div>
<div class="content">Christine:<br><br>To answer your question about Hannay seriously most of what he did in the 39 Steps novel (the recent dramatisation was a travesty) consisted of "immediate" items, which of course wouldn't go into a time management system.<br><br>But in the later novels, particulary those set after the war, he does in fact have quite a lot of discretionary time between the deeds of derring-do. Mind you, since he marries an extremely beautiful and intelligent woman twenty years younger than him, perhaps his discretionary time is fully taken up.<br><br>Today of course he would have it all on his laptop, which he would leave on a train to be handed in to journalists.</div>

<div class="content">This is the sort of thing that a Wiki could handle well, if there is a technical reason why it can't be extracted onto the main site or made sticky in the forum.<br><br>I missed the John Buchan theme first time through.

<div class="content">Will,<br><br>I suggested (and actually started) a wiki, but wasn't sure of the platform I'd chosen.  I set it up as a Google Site, but am now thinking of moving it over to Wetpaint.  Wetpaint has ads, but it seems a little more intuitive to add content for new users (and I wouldn't have to invite everyone). I was also kind of waiting for Mark's  "new" version of AF to be released.  I also wasn't sure anyone else would be interested in contributing to the wiki.<br><br>If anyone _would_ be interested in working on an AF wiki, I'll post the address so we can  start in on it.<br><br>Thanks.</div>

<div class="content">Jim,<br><br>may I suggest using a self-hosted and ad-free wiki? I took the liberty to set up a mediawiki (the wiki system used by wikipedia) at <a href="http://wiki.autofocus.cc/" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.autofocus.cc/</a> - if you'd like, we could use that.

<div class="content">Fine with me.  When I get a chance, I'll start moving the stuff I've begun over to yours.  You might want to start a new thread to promote it and have people start adding pages for each FAQ item.  Other good pages would be "Notebooks," "Pens," "Electronic-based options" and that sort of thing.  Maybe Mark could even provide a link.  I think it would be a valuable tool for those seeking specific answers versus community feedback.<br><br>Thanks!</div>
<h2>Reply by Andreas Hofmann</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-05-13 19:58</div>
<div class="content">I further divided the FAQ items into broader categories, and I "expanded" the first link into a actual question an selected answers. I took care to give credit and link to the original posts.<br><br>If anyone thinks I missed a good nugget in a thread or something is redundant, feel free to edit my changes. No registration is required.</div>
