<div class="content">Thanks, Frank. I didn't even know they'd got it up on Amazon!<br><br>At the moment it's showing "No image available", so I guess they've already corrected it.</div>

<div class="content">Mark's three books soon available on the Kindle: great news! Even though I have print copies of all of them, I'm sure to buy the Kindle versions for at least GED and DIT! A pity we'll have to wait until November 27 for them to become available. They would have made great holiday (re-)reading...</div>
