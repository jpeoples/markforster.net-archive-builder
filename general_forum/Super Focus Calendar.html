<div class="content">This post got me thinking...<a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1431981" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1431981</a><br><br>Why not add today's appointments to current page column 2 of SF?  That gives one place to view all important/urgent items for today. Obviously, you'll need to keep future items in a calendar or tickler, but today may be best corralled in one (SF) spot. <br><br>I wonder how that would impact the flow through SF pages, since it would mean C2 would fill up considerably quicker.</div>

<div class="content">Because of rewriting page after page and because it changes the rules to have stuff there you ignore. On the other side it's clear why you might want it on one page but I can't see me doing that.</div>

<div class="content">This was one of the main reasons I bought Pocket Informant for my iPhone. I've already contacted the developers there to see if there's any possibility for implementing SF in their software, but I'm not sure I'd give up my pen and paper. (It's amazing the psychological connection you get with physical handwriting.)</div>

<div class="content">I like to keep my day's appointments in front of me as I'm working my SF list, and also, I often like to have few items on a short list of things I hope to get done today. Although I work the SF list strictly according to the rules, it helps me to make sure I don't forget something that is time-sensitive.<br><br>I described my setup in the thread linked above.I have it in an 81/2 x 5 1/2 size looseleaf binder. When I open the notebook, the left-hand page has my schedule for the day (printed in advance from my computer) with room to write notes, or a "today list" or a shopping list, or whatever. On the right-hand page I have my SF list (current page on top; when I "turn to the next page" I put the top page at the back of the section.) This is working beautifully for me.<br><br>I have been using SF for a few weeks now, and have used other systems of Mark's. I am a GTD seminar alumnus, and have quite a large collection of time management books. All of these systems had something to offer, but I have never been quite so productive (and good about not letting things slip through the cracks) as I have been these past few weeks with SF.<br><br>I posted pictures of my notebook on the Flickr site. I enjoy seeing the pictures of people's various setups!</div>
