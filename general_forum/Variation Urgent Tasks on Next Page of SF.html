<div class="content">I'm trying a variation by which urgent tasks in SF are entered on the next page instead of the current page. I did try this briefly during testing, and it didn't work very well. But since then I'm  beginning to see some possible advantages and I'm not convinced I gave it a fair trial.</div>

<div class="content">I do see why you want to publish crystal clear rules, so all questions will be covered, but this seems like an inviting gray area.<br><br>Using SF, I've been inclined to put semi-urgent tasks a page back, so I know I'll think about them "a little later" but not have to deal with them right NOW.<br><br>I think/hope I understand the system, and this seemed like fair use and not abuse.</div>

<div class="content">It seems cleaner this way, although slightly less responsive. Now someone may have to push 5 things along instead of just wrapping up 1 thing to get to that urgent. Not a problem for me where nothing comes up that can't wait an hour. (interruptions come, but I take those to be just occassions to add todos, not a todo of itself.)</div>

<div class="content">As a procrastinator I sometimes get the urge(nt) to do something off-page.  As was, I could write the item in and (as Erik says) officially procrastinate. As Proposed I either cheat or put it off 30 minutes.  It's good to record such it keeps you honest with yourself.</div>

<div class="content">Alan:<br><br>Yes, that's what I felt myself, that it was too easy to keep adding "urgent" things to a page to prevent myself having to start a new page which had something on it I didn't want to do.<br><br>I can't help feeling that with "immediately urgent" tasks the answer is just to do them. They don't need writing down.</div>

<div class="content">I dont see any advantage. I can understand it for unfinished it let you time to do things later but is something s urgent it must be done very soon. Putting it on the C2 current working page  force you to do things and if you dont its just because you decided so... More I guess that if i put the urgent tasks on the next available page i would try to work on C1 it will may be force me to do thing i may not have to do just because i want to do the other page..<br>So I like the actual rules;</div>

<div class="content">I don't think it would work for me.  I do have things come up that need to be dealt with very soon, as in the next 5-15 minutes -- sometimes more than one thing, which does require me to write them down.   <br><br>Being able to take immediate action, while remaining WITHIN the rules of the system, is one of the key advantages of SAF.  (I don't count the "do it now without writing it down" rule, as a real system rule -- it's more of a way to "give permission" to the user to go off-system whenever it's really needed).<br><br>I could easily imagine examples like this:  I am currently working on a page.  It has two or three items already in Column 2, and several in Column 1.  My wife comes into the room and we need to talk for 15 minutes about some pressing things going on (with six children, goats, chickens, working from home, etc., there are ALWAYS pressing things going on!).  I open up my SAF book and start writing.  Most of the writing happens on the Last Page, column 1, but there are a few things that really need to be addressed as soon as possible, so (following the new amendment), I write them on the next page, column 2.<br><br>So, my wife leaves the room, and I get back to work.  With AF's help, I've come to be pretty good at focusing only on what is in front of me right now, so I start working my page again, and forget all about the urgent tasks my wife just gave me.  I spend an hour working some Column 1 items and clearing all the Column 2 items, finishing some, and moving others forward.  While doing this I am interrupted by a phone call, a couple IMs from co-workers, and an hour-long teleconference (pre-scheduled).<br><br>Finally I get to the next page, where I wrote all that urgent stuff from my wife.  Oops, it's too late now to make that important phone call she needed me to do, it'll have to wait till tomorrow.  Oops, I can't finish this other task today, I need my daughter's input and she already left for her afternoon class.  Oops, she asked me to check if two people had replied to our emails yet, that could've been done in 5 minutes, but I totally forgot about it.   And I've got all my OTHER stuff on this page that I already had to do, also.<br><br>None of that would have been a problem if I had written it in column 2 of my current page.<br><br>Also, this problem could be much worse if I happen to have one or two pages where Column 2 is already full.   Let's say I am currently working on page 1, when I meet with my wife.  Following the new amendment, I try to add these urgent tasks to page 2, column 2, but that column 2 only has room for 1 more item; the remaining items must go on page 3, column 2.<br><br>Now, when I finally get to page 2, I have an additional problem.  First, everything in column 1 now faces dismissal, since the page is completely filled, and this puts real pressure to bear on those column 1 tasks -- causing me to delay further taking action on my wife's urgent tasks, most of which are on page 3.   I might end up spending an hour or more on this page, if the items really need action and I can't just allow them to be dismissed.  <br><br>So, I finally come to page 3, and it's been 3-4 hours since I met with my wife.  It's a real problem by that point.<br><br>Sticking to the old rule avoids these problems (as long as I've got room in your current Column 2, which is usually the case!) and lets me take action immediately if I need to.</div>

<div class="content">I tend to see writing down urgent tasks as a bit of a paper exercise and I feel for me that the common sense rule of just doing it works. <br><br>In my world I will need to do a genuingly urgent task immediately anyway, otherwise it can be entered at the end of my column one list.<br><br>I can see the value of noting where once's focus is going by writing urgent tasks (inc. procrastination tasks) in column 2. Also, Mark has stated that it can be useful to add items in column 2 that are desirable to do that day, e.g. taking a walk. <br><br>On the other hand column 2 can get busy quickly entering tasks that maybe do not really need to be remembered, particularly if there is a visual reminder that it needs doing, as in the case of washing the dishes for example. <br><br>Moreover, is it possible with the current rules that an 'urgent' task could be given too high a priority in column 2 because it will either need to be done or deleted. Which seems a little all or nothing. <br><br>I'm considering dropping the whole urgent element for column 2 and simply using column 2 for unfinished tasks because this is where I see the best purpose for its use. <br><br>Any thoughts anyone??<br><br>I</div>

<div class="content">Well, after 11 hours of using the variation it seems so far to be working really well. It has the effect of speeding up the rate at which one gets through the pages. That means that the urgent tasks still get done pretty quickly.<br><br>However it's far too short a time to evaluate it anything like adequately.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark, <br><br>I have difficulty writing my thoughts out clearly: <br><br>I think what I was trying to say is as in this scenario: I initially think the task is urgent and important, which can especially be the case with Other Peoples' Priorities. <br><br> It turns out it isn't, (or even worse it's urgent but *not* important to me and my priorities) yet it will still need to be done *sometime* and not forgotton about. <br><br>On further consideration, therefore, one has stepped the priority level down from 'urgent' / 'unfinished' (column 2) to 'new' / 'recurring' (column 1). However, as I understand the rules, urgent items in column 2 must be done or deleted and not re-entered into column 1. Is this correct?<br><br>If I am correct this may indicate that column 1 tasks, which may be important but not urgent could potentially be at the mercy of column 2 tasks which are urgent but not important.</div>

<div class="content">I too have never found the "if it's urgent just do it now without writing" rule bothersome, thus I had been using good old AF1 since the beginning. <br><br>Now with SAFV3, column2 is almost totally for helping push unfinished tasks to completion. <br><br>Seraphim, I see the dilemma in your example, but in your position, after your wife left, I would just see which tasks absolutely need to be done now and do them. The rest would go at the end. <br><br>Then you can proceed with your list confidently, knowing nothing is lingering undone, no?</div>

However, there are several tasks, so I like to write them down.  Otherwise I am sure to forget some of them.  I could write separately onto another sheet of paper, but I really like writing things directly into my SAF notebook.  I don't like breaking the rule of "write everything down in one place".  <br><br>So, normally, if something seems urgent, I write it in the designated entry location for urgent tasks.  Otherwise it goes in column 1 on the last page.<br><br>I suppose I could write it all in column 1 on the last page, then ignore the rules for a bit and take care of the items that I just wrote down that happen to be urgent.  And then, when I'm done, go back to processing the list as normal.<br><br>But why do all that when SAF already has specific (and effective) rules for handling urgent items?</div>

<div class="content">I'm interested in Mark's observation that the whole list seems to move faster when he writes urgent items in column 2 of the next page.  So, maybe I'll try it.<br><br>Or, maybe this amendment would work:<br><br>- If something needs to be URGENTLY (that is, you want to handle the task before you'd come to it during the normal processing of your list), then write it in column 2 of the NEXT active page.<br><br>- If something needs to be done IMMEDIATELY (that is, within the next few minutes), write it in column 2 of the CURRENT active page.<br><br>I'll give it a try.   Seems a bit complicated, as now there are three entry points, but I'll report back on how it seems to be going.</div>

<div class="content">Glad this idea is getting another airing, it seems that in DIT the 'next day' aspect is key, so the 'next page' aspect for urgent tasks may have something worthwhile to offer SF.<br><br>Something else to try may be to write lowest urgency unfinished tasks at the end of the list in 'column 1' as per normal AF instead of on the next page in 'column 2'. <br><br>This should help stop column 2 filling up too quickly.</div>

<div class="content">Maybe, but most people in your circumstance have no time management system whatsoever. :-)<br><br>If you can read War and Peace you must have gobs of discretionary time. Why not go for a walk 4,5 or even 6 or 7 times a week?</div>

<div class="content">I get the feeling that the need for this variation will depend on the type of work that you do. <br><br>If most of your tasks are originating from you or your own projects where the deadlines are most organized and goal drive, then putting urgent things on the next page will help drag you forward through the list.<br><br>however in a customer service driven position putting urgent items on the current page will help you not miss obligations to others.<br><br>In my unique corner of the world, we get requests for urgent tasks from our customers that come in via phone, email, IM, support tickets etc. They have a variety of priorities and importances but usually they fall into two camps of due dates: (1) anytime in the next 3 weeks or (2) due 15 minutes ago, aka they arrive already over due.  <br><br>Putting urgent items on the current page handles this well as it doesn't force rushing the existing column2 tasks artificially whille absorbing what can be rapid fire arrive of must be done today items.. What maybe unique in our world is these are often tasks that can be done at the same time as they involve extended waiting periods that don't justify dismissing the tasks, aka installing a software patch that takes twenty minutes..<br><br>If I was to use this alteration it would have to be of the form.. Is the task urgent to a customer and will I break a promise if it does not get done today, then it goes on column two of this page, if it was urgent to me only then it could go on the next page...<br><br>Again this just shows that the system is flexible as all get out.  In my case on Monday's and Friday's I might never get off the current pages column 2 on tue-thurs I will probably blow around the page cycle several times and get a ton of column1 items down.</div>

<div class="content">This amendment still seems to be working very well, and I've not found any problem with urgent tasks. I think what I like best about it is that when you visit a page, you know it can't be added to. On the original method one could go on add task after task to Column 2 which one had persuaded oneself was urgent. The result was that it was a long time before you left the page.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark and All,<br><br>I have thought more about this and now have decided to keep the rules as you first stated.  My rationale is as follows.  If urgent things come up -- not so urgent that they need done right now  -- then I want these on the page I am working on at present -- not a page over.  I want to see them and realize that they need work on as soon as I can.  I get caught up in many of my projects that I have listed on my SF3 list that I know I am going to forget these if they are the next page over.  That is just me.  Another plus is it is a good measure for me as I am working through a page to see how many urgent things come my way.  Mark, as you pointed out a long time ago -- in DIT days -- that this is not so much time management as it is management of the situation one finds themselves.  In other words, the work culture.  Why is everything urgent?<br><br>So I am going to stay with the original rules.  I think these will work better for me...and if I have too many urgent things...I need to address why this is happening and try to remedy the cause.<br><br>-David</div>

So weighing the two together I've decided the original is best.</div>

<div class="content">If something must be done immediately, just stop what you do and do the urgent stuff now without writing it. But most urgent tasks are not of this category, they are in fact of the type "I must do this urgent task just after have finished what I am doing now. And for this purpose the current rules of SAF are fantastic.<br>And since the unfinished tasks go on the next page you clearly have a good idea of the priorities of the stuff you put in your system:<br><br>1) urgent on same page<br>2) unfinished on next page<br>3) tasks on last page<br>4) must done immediately tasks are not written and done immediately<br><br>This is all there is to it.<br><br>I don't see as a good idea putting the urgent tasks on the next page(there may be some situations you would prefer put it on the next page though, it may be used as an exception IMO).<br><br><br>The feature of being able to <br>enter tasks on C2 is fantastic because you can always skip directly to it after you finished the task you were doing. And since after have done it you have to do a last check on the same page from the beginning of C1 you can be sure you won't forget anything on this page before goint to the next. This is genius.</div>

<div class="content">I am pleased to see a move back in the original direction as I'm with Laurence et al on this one. My work includes a high percentage of urgent tasks and I fear the risk of missing an urgent task due to it being on the next page and out of sight. <br><br>However, as has already been noted, this may be a role-specific concern (it also may represent the fact that the quantity and nature of the demands on my time are unrealistic within the hours given - as I'm sure others could also claim).<br><br>I was surprised to read Mark's comment above: <br><br><< it was too easy to keep adding "urgent" things to a page to prevent myself having to start a new page which had something on it I didn't want to do. >><br><br>My immediate (naive?) response was to think that most 'urgent' tasks are normally tasks people are keen to avoid, rather than tasks used as an avoidance tactic. It would therefore be best to keep them on the current page and not be given a reason to delay them further by putting them on the next page. <br><br>Again, this is probably reflects the the diverse individual definitions of what constitutes 'urgent' (as I think Mark alludes to by using quotation marks). <br><br>[It may also reflect the fact that I don't make the time to read all the posts on this discussion forum and am neither up to scratch as the rest of you, nor as well versed in the flow of the SF system.

It's easy to find 'urgent' things to do if you have a mind to.  Having said that, even this tactic is self-limiting in a sense because column 2 has a limited number of spaces and once they are gone you have to move to the next page anyway.</div>
