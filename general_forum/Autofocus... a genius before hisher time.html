<div class="content">Mark - you should find a way to jump on this bandwagon (multitasking to singletasking). AF has a built-in structure to promote this behavior:<br><a href="http://lifehacker.com/5297183/singletasking-is-the-new-multitasking" rel="nofollow">http://lifehacker.com/5297183/singletasking-is-the-new-multitasking</a><br><a href="http://webworkerdaily.com/2009/06/19/singletasking-the-next-trend-in-web-working/" rel="nofollow">http://webworkerdaily.com/2009/06/19/singletasking-the-next-trend-in-web-working/</a></div>

<div class="content">Avrum:<br><br>Actually I'm not sure I agree with single-tasking v. multi-tasking. AF goes for a "little and often" approach, which is not quite the same as either of them.</div>

<div class="content">The soul of your system "work on xxxxxxx for as long as you want to" helps me singletask, without getting anxious about not getting to do other things. And the intuitive part of AF, both in how we choose a task, and how long to stay on it, would support some of what those articles are proposing. Or am I missing something?</div>

<div class="content">I think you're both right Avrum - Christine and I discussed this a couple of months ago - that following AF really does eliminate multi-tasking, yet facilitates touching on lots of things throughout the day.  It has all the benefits of both focusing and multi-tasking combined.</div>

<div class="content">Avrum:<br><br>Unless I've misunderstood the articles (I skimmed them rather than read them) they are  advocating working on a task until it's finished. AF may have similar effects but it's not the same. In fact as Jacqueline says it has the benefits of both, and hopefully none of the drawbacks.</div>
