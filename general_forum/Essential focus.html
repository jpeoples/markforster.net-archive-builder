<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2011-01-2 0:54</div>
<div class="content">Some months ago I posted on what I perceived to be the essence of AutoFocus, common properties of AF1, AF4, and DWM: <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1246486" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1246486</a><br>Since then some new systems have arisen, they've been tried, tweaked, mangled, restored, and largely passed the test.  It seems to me these systems also exhibit the same essence: SAF, AF4R, AF4+3T, DWM2, and My System.<br><br>Implementing these systems brings to light two more essential qualities:<br><br>1. Auto Processing.  No thinking required.  This is what makes AF1 such a beloved system to many.  You always know where to write stuff (last page).  You always know what to work on (current page).  You always know when to move on (this page is stale) and where (next page).  If the AF1 rules never had shortcomings, this would be the perfect system: All thought would be on the tasks at hand, and never the system.<br><br>The new systems complicate things a little.  SAF has two entry points.  You need to decide whether a task should be reentered here or there; a new task here or there.  If you advance a page, do you bring stuff with you or not?  Should you work strictly this page, or insert something that's on your mind?<br><br>AF4R has 3 points, and you have to decide each moment which category is appropriate.  DWM2 also asks whether something is unfinished or recurring or new.  AF4+3T makes you think about how big a task may be.  <br><br>2. Narrowed Focus.  This is a bonus from the new systems.  By sticking to a smaller group of tasks - those you're working on now - we can get those things done quicker.  As long as this doesn't keep us from fulfilling the obligations of completely and regularly scanning our work, this is a major improvement over earlier versions.<br><br>/////////////<br>The ideal system will make these decisions easy.  Keep focused without losing the big picture.  Keep choices simple to let your intuition run the system, and let your thinking mind stay focused on the work, not the system.<br><br>Auto and Focus: The new systems can get us there, but we must keep them simple.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks and you're welcome.  Usually when I write posts like this, my initial impetus is to be a reminder to myself.  It's a bonus that others can appreciate what I write.</div>

<div class="content">Alan,<br><br>Thanks for this and your other regular posts, which invariably prompt me to look again at my own practices.<br><br>I'm using SAF (from AF1 and, prior to that, DIT) and am finding that this is the best system for getting me to focus on the important stuff, by virtue of the narrowed focus that you refer to. And it retains the key benefits of the previous systems of simplicity and minimal overhead.<br><br>Happy New Year to all Forum Users!</div>
