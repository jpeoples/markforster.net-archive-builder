<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br><br>This has been brought up before, but I can't find the conversation.  If you have a task in column 2 of the current page you are working on and cannot work on it due to being in the wrong context (say files in your office and you are traveling or working at home), how do you handle that task?  Do you move it to the next page?<br><br>This is important for people who travel a lot on business and want to be productive in their hotel room at night.<br><br>Thanks,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Yes, that's correct, David. Just cross it out and move it to the next page.<br><br>But note that this only applies to Column 2 tasks, not Column 1.</div>

<div class="content">I was trying out Seraphim's method of having two fixed contexts (like work and home) on the same page but didn't work out so well. Many C2 tasks I couldn't attempt due to the constraints of the context I was in had to be cancelled and re-entered. I was afraid I would lose the feeling of urgency in completing C2 tasks this way, so I abandoned the trial.<br><br>I am now trying out the interleaving method of having personal and work tasks on alternating pages. It is working better.<br><br>Not entirely addressing the issue you raised David, but I was thinking that for a person who travels a lot, it might be worthwhile to have "travel" pages opened each time you go on a trip and circulate around them while away. Or pick things from the other contexts and enter them to the travel pages if they can be done.</div>

<div class="content">If you work on paper I advise you to use your notebook for home tasks on a side and work tasks on the other. I mean You urn your notebook and start a New SAF list form the end for work tasks.</div>

<div class="content">David:<br><br><< So what do you do if this is in column one, Mark? >><br><br>Column 1 tasks are treated as in AF1, i.e. dismissed if none are done when you visit the page.</div>
