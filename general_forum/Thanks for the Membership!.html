<div class="content">I just wanted to thank you Mark for creating a membership for your website. It will help a ton with the spam and makes it cozy at the same time. It feels like we really are in your manor :)</div>

<div class="content">Yes thank you from me too - it's nice to know that I won't waste any time checking threads were the posts are just spam!  A great time saving idea!!!</div>

<div class="content">Now I haven't got to spend all my time deleting spam messages I might actually get round to writing something on the blog!</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Mark. Now registered/logged in. I see if you are not logged in and tries to create post, you'll be prompted to email mf with 1) a log-on name 2) a display name 3) password. I think that slight barrier will not deter "new genes". I hope it does really block the spammers though. <br><br>It's nice that registered users can edit their post for a short period of time. I've also updated my author profile page with email and mobile no. ;-)</div>
