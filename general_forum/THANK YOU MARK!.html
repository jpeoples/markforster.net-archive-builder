<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">Hi Mark and everyone<br><br>I quit AF quite some time ago to concentrate on my painting. I said in response to another post (I don't recall which one right now) that I was happy to let everything else slide for the moment.<br><br>Well, with the release of AF2 I think I may give it a try again. I like some of the adjustments Mark has made to AF and am keen to get some tasks back on track (housework?!) and others started which had been allowed to slip for a while (last year's accounts). So I think this is a very opportune moment to restart AF(2).<br><br>Many thanks Mark for keeping on tweaking and improving rather than just resting on your laurels like other TM folks may have done. Let's hope you'll one day get round to making some money out of this as you deserve something for all the effort you put in on our behalf.<br><br>Just a slight aside - if you do produce AF2 as an online book I am one who would be very interested in a 'real' book. I find it hard to read much off a computer screen and also prefer the flexibility of having a real book to read anywhere I like - on the train, in the bath! etc. etc.<br><br>Thanks again and I'm looking forward to trying the new system...</div>

<div class="content">Yes, Mark, THANK YOU! This system is great. It is simple, yet not too simple! Just perfect! :)<br><br>Take care!</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>Let me add my thanks.  As it turns out, I was kind of moving in the general direction you took.  For some reason I found myself tending to work backward, and I have always done a "first thing" review of the whole list.  The blocking off and "putting on dismissal notice" is an interesting new wrinkle.  My hunch is that is going to make dismissal much more effective.<br><br>I foresee some real problems with people "dumping" with this system ... <br><br>... Day 1<br>50 tasks added<br>6 of the last 10 at the end of the list completed<br><br>... Day 2<br>The first 40 tasks put on notice for dismissal.<br>PANIC and OVERWHELM take over<br><br>LOL ;-)<br><br>I'm guessing that one of your first "rules" will have to be:<br><br>"Start your list with no more than a dozen tasks"!<br><br>Again, thanks for yet another creative approach.</div>
