<div class="content">Ok, I have no idea how many of you are aware about the 13 month calendar so here is a explanation to put everyone on par.<br><br>The fact that some months in our Gregorian calendar are longer then others is no news to anyone. The reason for this is that some people like Julius Caesar and Augustus Caesar thought themselves important enough to have their own months like all the roman gods but really a bit more important to not get 30 days but 31.<br><br>Now all those days where removed from the last month of the year which at that time was february thus we have a 28 day month!<br><br>Some efforts at standardization have been made but for some reason or another, none have sticked. One of those is the "13 Month Calendar", the "International Perpetual Calendar" or the "International Fixed Calendar" which is made of 13 months of 4 weeks each of 7 days each + 1 year day: 365 days. In leap years, you get a leap day inserted in summer.<br><br>What this gives you is months that always have 4 weeks, always start on a sunday and end on a saturday, the 11th of each month is ALWAYS a wednesday for example and all sorts of other benefits plus weird coincidences such as each week could actually be represented by a playing card!!!<br><br>Anyways, since DWM does not need exact dates and some people already use it dateless for days they do not work on their list, why not adopt a 28 days month scheme...?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Eirk,<br><br>I was using the 28 day period when I was trying out DWM, it just seemed easier and more logical for moi.<br><br>In fact I'm still using it with my current AF4 system.  Each day has in brackets after it [<br>Date+21 - (dash) Date+28] when I start the new day..<br><br>So today in my AF4, I wrote one below yesterday's last entry: 03/10 [24-31/10]<br><br>I cross out the date (03/10) at the end of the day, then on 24/10 I know it will be the last week/7 days  for any open tasks still under 03/10 and on 28/10\i will enter dismissal or LTBW mode and review those later (Let The B*****d Wait).</div>

<div class="content">Hi,<br>that's similar to the way I use DWM. I see the weekend as one unit, thus a week has six days in the system. I don't use dates at all. New tasks are entered at FAP+24 (FAP: first active page, page to be dismissed tomorrow), repeated tasks at FAP+6. This way recurring weekend tasks show always up for dismissal on a weekend.<br>Regards<br>Christian</div>

<div class="content">The 13 month (28 days per month) calendar is one of several financial calendars that attempt to make the accounting schedule more predictable.<br><br>There are several other calendars that try to standardize it in other ways. Some are here: <br><a href="http://www.calendarsthatwork.com/category.php?categoryId=account&sid=q4PFPYxp" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.calendarsthatwork.com/category.php?categoryId=account&sid=q4PFPYxp</a><br><br>There's also an international standard for numbering the weeks in the year, but I don't know how standard it really is, especially for leap years.</div>
