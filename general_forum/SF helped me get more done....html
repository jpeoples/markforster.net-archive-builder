<div class="content">...in my one week vacation than I have in YEARS. Maybe not volume-wise overall, but things that I'd put off. Things I needed to get done. <br><br>Thanks so much Mark! <br><br>I've used OmniFocus, paper, OF again, RTM, OF again. I always spent way more time admiring and tinkering with the software than actually doing anything. I knew that I worked better from a paper list and often tried printing things, or writing things down from a larger system. But I always got bogged down in trying to 'improve' the system. <br><br>I've cleaned out boxes, bags, drawers of things that have sat around ignored forever. I still have more to go, but I'm confident that it'll get done sooner rather than later.<br><br>I've left things in OF. I haven't pulled anything out of it to put into SF. It's still sitting there waiting for me. And when I feel I can/need to, I'll go through and pull some things in. I'd thought that I'd continue along with GTD overall and just use SF as my 'do' part. Now, I don't know. It'll be interesting to see. I'm sure I recognize some participants on this site from GTD sites. I'm up for any thoughts others have on this. <br><br>One amazing thing to me is somehow this week has empowered me to start the little, baby steps to begin a project that I've always felt would be very daunting...I have a car that has been sitting in the garage for years and I want to revive it. I always thought I'd need to be ready to 'do the project'. But so far I've found the records on the car, found the books about it, found some resources online, began conversing with some 'experts' online about how best to proceed. My goal is to get it going by spring break. Not 'done' just going. I thought it would sit for several more years. I'm confident that I'll be able to tackle it in bite-sized chunks and get it done. AND, most importantly, not neglect all the other areas in my life that need attention (which is what I tend to do, bury myself in one project/part of my life to the detriment of all others). <br><br>Thanks. Thanks. Thanks.</div>

<div class="content">Yay, malisa!<br><br>It's amazing how much better this feels compared to trying to FORCE yourself to do things.</div>

<div class="content">The most noticeable thing about SF for me has been the way in which an urgent task impacts existing tasks in C2.<br><br>Take this scenario: C1 is full with just one task left, and I am working intently on a project in C2. An urgent task commands my attention which I duly enter to C2. The project I was working on goes away to C2 on the next page. I deal with the urgent task and am eager to get back to my project. But I can't leave the page until the task in C1 is actioned.<br><br>It's an uneasy position to be in. Obviously, the last task in C1 is one which I have avoided working on (that's why its the last task), but I am now forced to deal with it before I earn the right to go back to my project.<br><br>It gets the job done, no doubt.</div>

<div class="content">For me I just want to say again and again THANK YOU, THANK YOU and THANK YOU. <br>Superfocus works perfectly I don't have any problem with it everything is done little by little and i feel indeed confident with the system. For the first time since I have been working SF is the only system which really suits to me. I just obey to the rule and it works. <br><br>I dont use much of GTD and quiet everything is on paper and it is very well like this. <br><br>I keep my computer for emails and things I must do with it, except this the central point is super focus, my weekly diary and my most important project. <br><br>Super focus brought me something else. The altitude. Before SF I had a real tendency to do more things I was able to so I often scratch myself on the wall and could no find my priorities. I realized I wanted to do my best and doing this I wanted too much about what i was able to do. <br><br>SF force me too think about things. It force me to ask me certain questions such as : Do I have to put this in C2 ?, Is it a real task or a dismissed tasks? , What do I have to do now which gonna be my highest priority ? <br><br>The only thing which worry me a little is that, some time, write on my list "work on project X". <br><br>I have to be very careful about this because the objective is to large and so I need to read the all list or goto the project to fetch all I have to do about this. <br><br>So, It is much better for me to write do this on project X because I just do it. May be it's because I kept this GTD habit to take some time during the day to work on my project and think about the best way to make them advance. <br><br>So thank you so much Mark for this incredible system. You were write, for me,  it's much better than all you ever made even if AF4 was a "bomb". SF is an "Atomic Bomb"</div>

<div class="content"><<Of course you can always bring the project back onto the same page as an urgent task>><br><br>Mark: I had to think about this for a while before I realised what you meant - bring it back by classifying it as urgent. It's surprising how you think you've read the rules inside out (about three times now on different occasions), but still miss out on the application. <br><br>I think I know why its so easy to get it wrong at times - the system is so flexible that you can't possibly think some parts of the rules are meant to be applied in the way that they are.</div>

<div class="content">Sorry, JD: don't understand: if you've finished the C2s and the C2 column still has some gaps, , why can't you move to the next page?<br><br>Have I misunderstood the rules again?</div>

<div class="content">I apologize for going completely off-topic, but... for some reason, I always assumed you were female, Jupiter. I have no idea why. I am changing my mental image of you right now! :)</div>
