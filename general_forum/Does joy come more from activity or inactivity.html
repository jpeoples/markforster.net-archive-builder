<div class="content">One area in which AF can be improved in my opinion is in the process of generating the items on the AF list itself. I realise it can just be whatever is on your mind, but I believe this can be enhanced by a deliberate use of "do nothing" time.<br><br>A constant state of doing can erode satisfaction, appreciation or joyfulness and peace. After all, we want holidays just to restore a focus on enjoyment and ease as our MITs.<br><br>So in light of my previous post I'd like to suggest a regular helping of "do nothing" minutes on the AF list, or use the randomiser in <a href="http://www.fungie.info/bell/#" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.fungie.info/bell/#</a> .Which (as I said in another post) is even nicer when combined with either <a href="http://www.donothingfor2minutes.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.donothingfor2minutes.com/</a> or <a href="http://www.radiobirdsong.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.radiobirdsong.com/</a> . Or maybe <a href="http://coffitivity.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://coffitivity.com/</a> ? <br><br>Slowing down is a decision for time to let the mud settle to the bottom of the river and let a clear view return. After those few minutes allow yourself to produce the next AF list. This can be challenging; I am often reminded of all of the things that I am “supposed to be doing” or “should be doing” instead of being still. But the rewards are more tranquility, and perspective on the day which I deem as success in being myself. Advanced doing nothing requires actively relaxing your mind and body, and slow breathing. Ultimately mastery comes from doing nothing while in nature.<br><br>Doing nothing can be a waste of time, or it can be an art form. It can also invoke your internal moraliser who may call you an idler, sluggard, layabout, slacker; loafer. Why not join the cause? <a href="http://slowdownnow.org/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://slowdownnow.org/</a>  (no connection or affiliation, just a coincidence).</div>

<div class="content">Hi Michael<br>It's me again rebutting your expert declarations.  You stated:<br><br>"But the rewards are more tranquility, and perspective on the day which I deem as success in being myself. Advanced doing nothing requires actively relaxing your mind and body, and slow breathing. Ultimately mastery comes from doing nothing while in nature."<br><br>Who sez?  Advanced doing nothing requires slow breathing?  That will occur naturally with practice.  It's not a requirement at all.  It becomes a natural occurrence with a relaxed mind with practice.<br><br>Ultimate mastery can occur in nature?  I think not.  It's lovely and supporting yet not a requirement.  Furthermore, using the word "ultimate mastery" and "advanced" mastery sound, frankly pretentious and erroneous.  Either you're blissfully engaged in detachment or you're not.  Of course, everybody perceives experiences differently.  Why do you feel the need to give confining rules and confining definitions to advice that is often otherwise good advice?  You offer much that has been helpful when you don't get in pedantic mode.  I'm still in awe of your revelation about dreading the 10th step.  That is one of the most powerful things I've learned on these forums.  If you had decided to attach silly rules and buzz words to it, I might have never learned from it.  Just saying...<br><br>This is intended more as a sincere suggestion than only a criticism. I'm sure that I'm not the only person who registers instant aversion when recognizing arbitrary rules and erroneous declarations.  LOL!</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>The title should have alerted me.<br><br>"Does joy come more from activity or inactivity?"<br><br>Many things in life aren't either/or.  That  insight, alone, should bring you mind more at ease.</div>

<div class="content">I started meditating this year. I'm using the method on Wildmind.org. It has many similarities to Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction, but is more accepting of a lower level of commitment. (20 minutes a day rather than 45.) There's a recommended sequence, and many, many options (along with advice to stick with each method for several sessions).<br><br>Sometimes it seems like doing nothing. You're certainly not doing anything visible. At the end, you don't have anything concrete to show for it, not even a moved bookmark or dead pixels. I haven't done it enough to say whether I'll get all the benefits that recent studies attribute to it.<br><br>One of the challenges is sitting down and doing it. It and music get pushed back more than any other routine activities. I think it's because they're just for me.<br><br>Thanks for the reminder to do that next! (Looking forward to next week. Not a lot of irregular events, so can rebuild routines.)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Cricket<br>The greatest challenge for me was learning how to actually quiet my mind. I eventually honed the practice via long distance running.  I could never have guessed that running would help teach me that.  LOL!  Now I don't ask as much.  Chronic pain, especially severe spikes from my spinal cord, shatters it like a sledgehammer to glass.  LOL!</div>

<div class="content">There is a quote - attributed to Buddha - that when asked what he had gained from meditation he replied "nothing". The point being that what he had lost was what mattered.</div>

<div class="content">Today the universe had more fun with me. I had put the audio on my new tablet, and was using the recording for the next stage, so I wasn't familiar with the timing. Even so, the silence for the first stage of breathing seemed to go on a bit long. Turns out sleep mode interferes with the player.<br><br>Dear Universe, I don't ask much, and realize you have given me far more than my fair share, but interfering with the things I do that will help me make better use of your gifts is a bit much.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Cricket<br>WTH?  People endure challenges far greater than that with no possibility of relief. Instead, maybe you might thank the universe for gifting you with such a relatively cushy life.  You have no idea what "is a bit much" truly is. Think about it...</div>

<div class="content">If I cannot be frustrated or upset, just because others have more cause than I do, than I cannot be happy or grateful just because others have more cause than I do.<br><br>I can, however, do a better job of remembering the audience.</div>

<div class="content">Getting back to the thread's title, I am thinking that the question is a non-starter.   It's kind of like asking, "Does joy come from up or from down?  from girls or from boys?  from wet or from dry?   from heat or from cold?"   If you are looking for joy in any of those places, then I don't think you'll find it.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Cricket<br>That's convoluted logic.  It's human nature to sometimes complain or whine. It's also human nature to share joy.   You know that it's not the real issue.  It's a completely different issue when you're admonishing The Universe (or God) for such a trifling inconvenience.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Seraphim<br>LOL!  Also, I've found that joy is sometimes contextual. Joy is to be found while active and in repose alike.  I agree.  The seat of joy is internal which can be coaxed externally as well.  <br><br>""Does joy come from up or from down? from girls or from boys? from wet or from dry? from heat or from cold?"<br><br>LOL!  You do have a way with words...</div>
