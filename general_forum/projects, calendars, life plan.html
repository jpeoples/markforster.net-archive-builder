<div class="content">I've been exploring autofocus and so far I like it for the sort of seamless zoom in on what doing. however I've got a question, or two<br><br>works great for me, in a now sort of way, such as, got a bunch of things to do, just do them. what I'm unable to figure out, is how to plan larger projects, schedule across time and such - even... life plan - goals, future<br><br>i've read that it just works with whatever project plan and calendar system a person has... but, what if the person does not have a system that works for them? - which is sort of why I'm here in the first place, somewhat lost at that.<br><br>OK, to be more specific: I understand the basics of project management, project A is due Friday. It has 5 steps, 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. how long do they take... place them on the calendar from today (monday) until Friday, and it has been planned ....<br><br>ahh, but with autofocus, not suppose to have to schedule all those steps, just do them as come to me and feels right<br><br>AND<br><br>even with normal scheduling system, I'm OK with a world of one project, but nobody has ONE project, we have many, of various priorities, immediate and long term, work and personal<br><br>I have difficulty in figuring out how to interleave and plan everything and be sure I'm not just living in the immediate crisis moment (can keep that in my head) but also, feel good that working towards meaningful long term<br><br>anyone grok what I'm attempting to express? and great systems? any fit to autofocus?<br><br>thanks, Matthew</div>

<div class="content">There are many approaches.  Here's one: Put all your projects (those you are currently working on and intend to progress) on your AF4 list.  Where relevant, put due dates next to the project name.<br><br>Document/plan each of those projects in a separate place.  Follow AF to direct you in working on those projects.  If some critical tasks come up that you need to do, add such also to your AF list, but only the critical tasks.  General tasks are picked up by the project entry.<br><br>Now do the AutoFocus thing with your list.  Work on any project you want to, as much as you feel you need to.  Rewrite that project at the end of the list.  Move on.</div>

<div class="content">thank you Alan.<br><br>so to clarify, if the project is named (X) and has sub tasks 1, 2 & 3 which I pre-plan on another piece of paper<br><br>and then I'm in my AutoFocus list working on #1, when done do I rewrite #2 at end of AF list<br><br>OR<br><br>write (X) at end of list to trigger me to go look at my (X) list as to what might work on next? which in this case would be #2<br><br>hmmm, perhaps even the (X) sheet could be run like an AF list, and NOT have then in any exact order.<br><br>OK, I'll give this a try and find out what happens, thank you, Matthew</div>

<div class="content">here is another issue. what about recurring tasks? such as backup hard drive.<br><br>assume it should be done once a week. but I'm OK with it being a couple days late, just don't want it to be a week late. or even assume it needs to be done exactly every week.<br><br>it just on an AF list, there is no sense of time/date/schedule. other than when do it, I mark done and then add again to bottom of list. the actual day it gets done will still be too fuzzy based on my memory of when it feels right to do it.<br><br>perhaps this is covered and I missed it, thanks, Matthew</div>

<div class="content">Why not schedule it into your diary?</div>

<div class="content">Alison. This is good, these questions are pushing me towards what I'm realizing were sort of stupid questions to what I think the heart of what I'm asking is about. And hopefully answers may help others as well.<br><br>Although, does say to use with whatever system using with calendar/diary and such. I guess what I'm asking, is how to make that bridge between the diary and AF?<br><br>Scan the AF list and daily diary as part of scanning process as to what to do next?<br><br>Or every day copy over to AF list from what is listed that day on my diary?<br><br>thank you, Matthew</div>

<div class="content">Regarding your questions from yesterday: all the approaches you mention are workable.  Choose your favourite, or try them all at once.<br><br>Regarding the diary, every morning I make a point to look at it and move every task scheduled for today over to my AF list.  Then I put the diary away for the day, except to record new scheduled tasks.  Weekly recurring tasks I put back into the diary for the next week when I'm done.</div>

<div class="content">matthew:<br><br>The method I recommend for bringing tasks forward is to put them into a reminder system like Outlook Tasks so that reminders come up first thing in the morning.<br><br>Then enter the task(s) into the AF list, and process them as normal.<br><br>In other words the reminder is not to do the task, but to put it on the list.</div>

<div class="content">I've joined the discussion late but has the same problem as Matthew expressed. I have lots of time-critical projects which have multiple steps/tasks. I also have limited discretionary time. Putting these tasks just in AF doesn't work as I need to use my calendar to block out specific periods of time to work on these. Otherwise I get high anxiety that I'm going to miss the  deadline. I used to put them on my AF list as well but have stopped doing that.<br><br>So my AF list seems to consist now of tasks that don't have a deadline (and when I'm busy like now) it's really more of a Someday/Maybe list.</div>

<div class="content">Linda:<br><br>Lack of discretionary time to do tasks which require discretionary time means that you have to pay more attention to how you handle those tasks and what they are, not less.</div>

<div class="content">Here's a tactic I use if I have a hard deadline on a project.  <br><br>First, I make sure I include the deadline when I write the task on my AF list:<br><br>- Project A (due 1/31)<br><br><br>If I am worried the task might get lost for some reason, then I also add a recurring task in Outlook that pops up every day (or every other Monday, or whatever seems to make sense for that project).  <br><br>I use Outlook tasks exactly as Mark describes, so I'd write<br><br>- Project A (due 1/31) <br><br>into my AF book every time that Outlook task pops up.<br><br>The process of entering and re-entering makes VERY sure I don't forget about it.  <br><br>If it starts cluttering up the AF list, then I might stop entering the new ones.<br><br>If you don't use Outlook, you can do the very same thing using any kind of tickler system, such as a paper-based "43 folders" approach, or a paper calendar, or whatever.</div>
