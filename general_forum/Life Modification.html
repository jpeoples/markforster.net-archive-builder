<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">An email popped into my mailbox from Motivation123 which read as follows...<br><br>I didn't quite know what to expect when<br>I started watching this video, but I was<br>totally taken by surprise.<br><br>I was so impressed, in fact, that I<br>couldn't wait to share it with you.<br><br>Check it out here:<br>h-t-t-p://www.LifeModification.com/m1<br><br>I've purposfully broken the hyperlink (by changing http to h-t-t-p) to ensure you don't just follow the link.  I sat dilligently and listened to the video, which I thought was going to offer free advice.  Oh, no!  At the end I'm invited to stump up £45 - whatever that is in $ for the privilage of getting to the view videos that would follow.<br><br>I'm posting this to see if anyone else has seen this?  Has anyone actually paid - and if so is it any good?  Because I'd like to believe in these things but feel that if anyone found the thing that actually worked (like a make you look younger face-cream) then absolutley everyone would buy it and everyone would look young.  So why aren't we all exceeding our own expectations?<br><br>Which is why I like Mark's work.  It doesn't pretent to make you rich, famous etc. it promises to help you just get done the things you want to get done.  My friend is a very successfull business man.  He and I are no different.  He had a good idea for a business and implemented it.  I haven't had the idea yet.<br><br>Sorry to ramble...its easy to get lost in thought as you type...<br>I must admit I'm tempted to cough up the £45 which is a substantial amount of money for me.  Just to see what this bloke is flogging.  Because deep down you wonder - is this going to be it - is this going to be the one that creates a change for me?</div>

<div class="content">Don't do it Roger.  I've never paid for anything like this and been satisfied.  £45 is a lot of money when you don't know what you are getting.  When I've analyised it, these people know no more than me - they are just clever at getting you to part with your money.<br><br>I do think if this was such a good thing the person concerned would be a lot clearer about what you are getting for your dosh!<br><br>Why don't you tell us what it is about your life you are unhappy about and we can all give you some FREE advice?</div>

<div class="content">I started to listen to it since it said that it only lasted for "a couple of minutes", but after 20 minutes of nothing other than the standard patter that comes with every "wonderful opportunity" I gave up.</div>

<div class="content">I did the same Mark - it sounds like a bit of a copy of the Anthony Robbins stuff.  In other words 'give me some money and I'll tell you how to have loads of money and a very attractive wife (who of course will leave you just as soon as you loose your money)".</div>

<div class="content">I hope I didn't waste to much of your time with it.  I did try by busting the hyperlink.<br><br>I'm not terribly unhappy at all.  I just suffer from the usual procrastination, self-doubt stuff as everyone else.  Life is set to get a little harder.  My wife's teaching job has gotten so bad (with all the extra rubbish the goverment, etc. etc. etc. and very bad leadership at the school) that we've both agreed she will resign.  So for the next 3 months (whilst she works her notice) we're going to life on my wages only and save hers up.  Which is good practice because we're planning to have a baby.<br><br>My job is good and I have to have a system for managing my day-to-day workload.  I manage a team of nine people in a Tech department.  Mark's books and systems are the only ones to be adopted - so I guess they work.  I like everyone else have to "fiddle" with them to fit my own cicumstance.<br><br>I'm really excited about the coming update and am trying not to second guess.  I'm patiently waiting for the "good stuff" and will see how it helps.  I'm slowly becoming an evangulist at work and trying to get other people to see the benefits of adopting systematic approaches to work.<br><br>I lose count of the times I'm given work to do, which then the person who asked for it seems to forget they asked for it.  I'm determined NOT to be that boss to my team.  I try very hard to give them a picture of what we want to achieve and let them (with help) work out how to achieve it.  Much better all round.<br><br>Roger.</div>

<div class="content">Roger, if you want to read what is the source for almost all modern motivational material such as The Secret and likely the one you were looking at then try this.<br><br><a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Science_of_Getting_Rich" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Science_of_Getting_Rich</a><br><br>there are plenty of people trying to sell it, but this version is free. I have no guarantee if will work or if rubbish, but at least it is not expensive.<br><br>Same goes for generic modern motivation, can find good information all over the web. And of course planning and getting things done from this site.<br><br>If you combine:<br><br>1. a sort of where do I want to go with my life and how do I want to live it?<br>(do I go from New York to Boston or Providence) (do I take a car or train or bus)<br><br>2. make a plan. (today I buy tickets, tomorrow I pack food for the car trip, friday I drive 50 miles and then stop to see the seashore)<br><br>3. add some of the motivational methods on top, so that things start going your way and you see what is working in your life, solutions come to you and such<br><br>4. then use AutoFocus to make sure your life actually unfolds as you planned<br><br>5. adjust as needed (hey, nice weather, maybe we stay at the beach an extra day)<br><br>this is super short summary, but should get you out of many of your troubles and back on the road again</div>

<div class="content">Mathew,<br> <br>If you want to get back to the modern source of the wishful thinking philosophy ... in modern times it is Emerson and the Transcendentalists.  They spawned Christian Science and all of that goo gah.  And Emerson at least know how to craft a sentence!  If you want to get to the true roots of it you might as well start with Plato.  He was the first to say that reality is not real.  (Well, the first who's words we still have and who said it well.)<br><br>As to your formula ... spot on.  ;-)</div>

<div class="content">From one Roger to another,<br><br>Like Mark F, I gave up, reminded me of an old joke about a widowed virgin whose latest husband had been an "IBM Salesman"  and " . . he just stood at the foot of the bed telling me how great it was going to be, but passed on before he did anything."<br><br>Since AF1 started, I've not looked at much else, this forum gives enough hints and tips and help keep me on the straight and narrow.<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Roger J (not currently peripatetic)</div>

<div class="content">I second the Science of Getting Rich, great book.  <br><br>I would think about resigning from a job if you will be trading the stress of a job for money stress of a lower income.  I personally think you stay until you have something else.  <br><br>I started as a much more hands off manager and found unfortunately I have to manage people closer than I would like.  It is just a fact.  When people give you work, maybe you need to be a little harder on them before taking it.  Say, Is this a priority and when will you actually need this done by.  <br><br>As far as other people's time management, I have written about how bad it was at a few places I worked.  It is hard to get people to adopt systems.  I have seen poor time management cost people jobs, money, employees.  <br><br>Mark, there is a reality show in there somewhere.  Time Management intervention, maybe that is the way for you or I to monetize this niche.  I am sure there are some CEOs that need the help and it would make for good TV. <br><br>Gerry<br><br><a href="http://www.simple-time-managenent.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-managenent.com</a></div>

<div class="content">Mike, thank you. Emerson is mentioned at the start of The Science of Getting Rich. That was my next step in looking into the source.<br><br>"It is the foundation of all the Oriental philosophies, and of those of Descartes, Spinoza, Leibnitz, Schopenhauer, Hegel, and Emerson.<br><br>The reader who would dig to the philosophical foundations of this is advised to read Hegel and Emerson for himself."</div>
