<div class="content">Hi Mark and Colleagues,<br><br>I am enjoying Autofocus 4 these days.  I find it to be the best of the four Autofocus versions that I have tried.  As for urgent items -- and ones with hard due dates -- I add these as tasks in the To-Do Bar in Outlook 2007.  As I have to maintain my calendar in Outlook 2007, this is a good place to keep track of tasks that have hard due dates.  All other tasks go into my spiral-bound, paper notebook as my AF list.<br><br>Mark, would you please give us an update on where you are with AF1, and what your thoughts are relative to how well you are getting along with it versus your use of AF4?  I think all of us would be very interested!<br><br>Thanks....and best wishes,<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">I haven't posted here for a while - been busy - but I am doing absolutely fine with AutoFocus 4 also.<br><br>It does everything I need and keeps me focused even when things get out of control.<br><br>I find I'm not spending much (if any) time sifting through the time management forums anymore because I've found what I've been looking for, and so I've finally cured myself of looking for the next "silver bullet" solution.<br><br>AF4 is a "gold bullet" solution. :-)</div>

<div class="content">AF4 is perfect for me too. I use it for all my activable tasks and it replace my #gtd contexts<br>There is no particular difficulties. <br>Perfect following of old item, perfect focusing on urgent tasks, perfect following of available projects; What else ? ;))</div>

<div class="content">Although I said so in another post, ditto to the above comments.  AF4 is perfect for me.</div>

<div class="content">Perhaps I should have kept quiet about going back to AF1 because all I am trying to do is remind myself of how it compares with AF4. I certainly wasn't suggesting that people should abandon AF4 in favour of AF1.<br><br>In answer to David's question about how I'm getting on, the answer is pretty well so far.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>I am glad because AF4 works so well for me....I still think it is the best of the versions.<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Mark, (and others)<br><br>Can you give a basic average time of how long it takes to close out the closed list in AF4 or at least a broad feeling of whether you closed out a page faster in AF1 than you close out the closed list in AF4?<br><br>I'm just wondering because the time to turn around a page was a big motivator for me in AF1 (trying to beat the past average time or hitting a new low # of days to close).  <br><br>Hmm... maybe the question belongs in the productivity games thread.</div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline:<br><br>It rather depends on how long your list is. A page in AF1 contains 34 tasks in my notebook. The total number of tasks in one's AF4 list at the moment of closing the open list could be anything. Initially one's closed list will contain every task on the whole list. So on average I would expect the closed list to take longer to finish than an individual page on AF1.<br><br>But on the other hand, simply because the list initially contains everything you currently have to do the time it takes to clear it is more meaningful than with AF1 pages.</div>

<div class="content">I'm playing with AF1 at the moment (just joined the community). It looks OK so far (3 days passed). I do more then I did with GTD.</div>
