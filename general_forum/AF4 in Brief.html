<div class="content">For those who didn't get to Page 4 of the Comments from Mark's Fri 04 Sep live-blogging, I'm repeating my summary post here.<br><br>I'd like to offer a simple description of the process. I'll use C ("Current") for open list #2, and B ("Backlog") for closed list #1.<br><br>Brief Autofocus 4 Instructions (assumed start at Current List)<br><br>1. Unicycle C, then multicycle B. Return to C after unproductive B cycle.<br><br>2. On return from C to B, cross out each highlighted task.<br><br>3. On unproductive initial B cycle, highlight all B tasks then close entire list. Continue to multicycle newly expanded B, skipping highlighted tasks.<br><br>I think that covers the entire strategy, other than the details we already know how to do (e.g. choosing what "stands out"; deciding which highlighted items to re-enter and re-word, etc.).</div>

<div class="content">Ubi,<br><br>That is indeed a condensed summary.  On the off chance that it is TOO condensed for those who were not following the demonstration Mark gave today, let me post a more expanded description.<br><br><br>=====<br><br>Summary of AF4<br><br>The AF4 list structure -- AF4 consists of two lists (or list parts)<br><br>- The first is a closed list called "Backlog" (for the moment ... it might later be called the "Closed List")<br>- Second is an open list<br>- The two lists are treated as one with regard to where one is in the overall processing cycle. IOW, start tomorrow where you left off today.<br><br><br>[NOTE: There is possibly a third list, of a transient nature, which results from marking all tasks on the first list as "on notice for dismissal", moving the "line" to the end of the second list, and then adding new tasks after that line ... thus resulting in the temporary creation of the third list. This third list is quickly deleted when, on the next pass, all "on notice items are deleted. See the processing details for more information.]<br><br><br>The rules for processing AF4 are as follows:<br><br>1. The first ("Closed") list is cycled through repeatedly and items are actioned (if they stand out), or passed over<br>1.1. Actioned items are crossed out<br>1.1.1. If there is more work to be done (or the task is repetitive), it is added to the end of the second list.<br><br>1.2. If something was actioned in this pass and nothing further stands out<br>1.2.1. Move to the beginning of the second list and begin scanning/processing that list<br><br>1.3. If nothing was actioned in this pass of the first list<br>1.3.1. All items are put "on review"<br>1.3.2. The "backlog line" is moved to the end of the second list making all of that the new "backlog"<br>1.3.3. All new items are added after the new "backlog line"<br><br>1.4. On the next pass of the first list, after returning from working on the second "Open" list<br>1.4.1. Dismiss all "on notice" items<br>1.4.2. Add back any that seem to want to be done to the end of the second list (possibly rewording them)<br><br>2. The second ("Open") list is processed in only one pass each time it is entered<br>2.1. It is processed only when nothing stands out from the first list<br>2.2. As with the first list, if an item is actioned it is crossed off and re-added to the end (of the second, open, list) if there is more work to do or it is a repetitive item<br><br>=====<br><br>That is my best understanding so far. I'm sure there are more errors, so ... ;-) <br><br>Oh, and PLEASE wait for Mark to post the description in his own words.  It is HIS system, after all ;-)</div>

I handwrote my own instructions (much like yours above), then condensed them down to the essentials so I could remember how to do it.

<div class="content">Here's my interpretation of the rules, for what it's worth:<br><br>1. Start at the beginning of the Closed List, and look at each item. <br><br>2. If an item is highlighted, you must either take action, or delete the item.  ("Take action" can also mean "rewrite the task at the end of the Open List") <br><br>3. If an item is not highlighted, you may take action if you like, or you may skip.  After you take action, cross off the item from the Closed List.  If work still remains for that item, add it to the end of the Open List. <br><br>4. When you come to the end of the Closed List:  if you have taken action on any of the items on the Closed List, then start again at the beginning of the Closed List and go through it again.<br><br>5. But when you get to the end of the Closed List without having taken action on anything: <br>          (A) If this was your first pass through the Closed List: <br>                    1. Highlight all remaining items on the Closed List. <br>                    2. Move the Line to the end of the Open List (so now, all items are on the new Closed List). <br>                    3. Keep working through the Closed List (which now includes the tasks that used to be on your Open List)<br><br>          (B) Otherwise: <br>                    1. Start at the beginning of the Open List, and look at each item. <br>                    2. For each item, you may take action, or you may skip. After you take action, cross off the item from the Open List.  If work still remains for that item, add it to the end of the Open List. <br>                    3. When you get to the end of the Open List, go back to Step 1.<br> <br><br>I'm sure others can write this more clearly than I have, but does this sound accurate?<br><br>And also, I'm quite sure Mark's version will be much clearer, more succinct, more fun to read, and will reveal more of his great insights and tips.  :-)</div>

<div class="content">Assuming I am understanding the rules correctly, the one thing that has me a bit worried is the built-in automated processing of the highlighted items.<br><br>I'm not so sure I like having them deleted like that.  I could always put them in my tickler system, but I kind of like the way AF1 would keep them percolating as long as I needed them to, with my periodic "review dismissed items".  It was up to me to decide whether to delete, rewrite, put on the tickler, or whatever.<br><br>That was my initial reaction, at least.<br><br>Upon further thought, some additional things occurred to me. <br><br>(1) Mark's demo was in "high speed".  He himself said it would normally take several days to work through a Closed List before any of the items got highlighted.   And then it might still take a while before he got to the point of deleting those items.  So, the percolation effect is still in play.<br><br>(2) In some ways the added discipline is really appealing:  being forced to deal with highlighted items, forced to make a decision, not just letting them sit there to be reviewed occasionally.  <br><br>(3) Maybe the new deletion of highlighted items changes the psychology of the system (for better, or for worse?), and maybe it will mean lots of rewriting and redispositioning of highlighted tasks.  But I'll just have to give it a try and see how I like it.<br><br>Thanks again Mark for all these great systems!</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Ubi and Mike for your excellent summaries. A question on the start of the day: The rule seems to be that you start out where you left off. <br><br>So would I be correct to assume that if you are starting out on the 1st part of the list (the backlog part), you would do multicycle processing around that part before moving on to the 2nd part ?</div>

<div class="content">Waiting for Mark, I find the flow of Seraphim in line with what I understood. Of course thanks to the many, who have helped to clarify it, and to Mark for his incredible "live show".<br><br>I'm going to switch to AF4 right now, after reaching a "Switch to AF4" item the RAF way - it just stands out.<br><br>This is the first time in my life I follow an evolving blog and read its numerous comments - a large number indeed - to their full extent - a really intensive experience.<br><br>But AutoFocus is also the first system I'm able to consinstently use for months. So no surprise - "AF4 live" stood out about 15 times on the list.</div>

<div class="content">The only thing I wonder about is the handling of new and urgent items. In AF2 I just added them to the end of my list and immediately switched to that task.<br><br>In AF4 (as far as I understand it by now) I may have to work through my backlog and my current list (depending on where I am when the urgent item appears) before I get to work on the emergency. For me this would mean skipping everything to reach the emergency a.s.a.p - and that would imho not suit the AF-philosophy.<br><br>Any ideas or something I overread or got wrong?</div>

<div class="content">The "common sense" rule still applies - if you know something has to be done immediately, then do it.<br><br>Apart from that, AF4 should carry even slow movers like me fast enough through the list to catch up with urgent items. AF1 was not very able to handle urgent tasks, RAF/AF3 was too focused on urgent tasks - AF4 promised to provide the balance we all were looking for.</div>

<div class="content">Richard:<br><br><<  I may have to work through my backlog and my current list (depending on where I am when the urgent item appears) before I get to work on the emergency. >><br><br>You will have noticed that I moved through the list very fast, especially when the backlog was large. I find this happens naturally. Paradoxically the larger the backlog, the quicker one moves through it. <br><br>In the case of an urgent items, imagine that you are buried in your backlog somewhere. You write the urgent item at the end of the active list. Your subconscious/intuition tells you to get a move on, so you finish working on the backlog item you are currently on, circle round the backlog - nothing. Move through the active list - nothing. Action the urgent task (which is still the last item in the list). <br><br>Where do you go from there? As you've just done the last task on the list, you go to the beginning of the list, i.e. back into the backlog.</div>

<div class="content">Mark -You wrote  "Move up the active list - nothing."  Does that mean that the active list is worked from the most recently added item back up the page (in the same way as RAF)?   I had rather thought you started at the top of the active list and worked to the bottom, in which case nothing would stand out until you reached the urgent item.  Thanks for all your hard work.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Mike,<br><br>First, your detective work yesterday was quite impressive. It was great watching you crack the code.<br><br>Second, I appreciate the clarity with which you have formulated the rules. In the interests of enhancing that clarity, I offer my feedback. If I understand you correctly, "on notice" and "on review" are synonymous. You might be trying to make a distinction whereby they are termed "on notice" in the prior pass through the list and "on review" in the subsequent pass. But I think it clearer to use one term to describe the items that are materially the same in steps 1.31 and 1.41. <br><br>This is just "my humble opinion." It's a well-known fact that the clearer the thinker, the easier it is to expose areas for improvement. Thanks again.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>O.K.  So I have already made a tweak!  LOL ;-)<br><br>No, this is not a tweak to make THE SYSTEM work better.  I made it purely to accommodate my physical setup.  I'm posting it here so that others who have similar physical limitations might think about how to get the benefits of AF4 if they are working with a page oriented physical setup.<br><br>My setup:  <br><br>- As I have said before, I don't work at a desk so I can't use a computerized implementation ... paper works best for me. But this also means I need a small format book to carry in my pocket.<br><br>- The smaller format (3x5 inches) also means that there are fewer items on a page (20) so I found myself flipping around the book too much.  I tried paperclips, rubber bands, dog earing pages, moving Post-its around ... all added a level of fussing I was not comfortable with.<br><br>- I also have several lists I keep with me: shopping, discussions with my wife, etc.  I don't want those items distributed through a long list so I keep separate lists.<br><br>- Because of those considerations I switched from my beloved cheap ass spiral books to a Circa/Rollabind book.  (Basically movable pages.)<br><br>My modified AF system works well with this setup, but with AF4 I was puzzling about how to manage drawing the line and moving the closed backlog out of my way and making the active section a backlog.  Basically, with movable pages I got everything flowing smoothly by removing pages when they were closed.  But now that AF4 no longer uses "pages" but is, physically, a single long list ... I was facing having to start flipping pages again.  No way, Jose ;-)<br><br>So here is my minor alteration.  When it comes time to draw the line at the end of the active list and delete the closed list, I don't draw the line at the end of the last item, but rather draw it at the end of the last full page.  IOW, some of the items at the end of my open list remain on the open list.  What does this mean for me?<br><br>- I can remove the old closed list pages (adding the kept items to the end of the remaining open list page)<br>- I then move all of the FULL pages of the open list to the front of the book (I have a divider tab separating the closed and open lists for ease of access)<br>- I then have the last partial page starting the new open list and I continue adding to that.<br><br>The only effect on the system is that I have as many as 19 maximum (10 average, 1 minimum) open list tasks that remain on the open list when I "draw the line".  I don't see that as a problem for me.  At my current level of task chunking and activity I fill between one and three pages (add 20-60 items) per day, so an average of 10 items that don't become backloged when they "should" is a nit, as I see it.<br><br>Also, since I have the ability to easily remove pages, I remove pages (from both lists) with all items completed as I go.  IOW, if I have only two items open in 4 pages on the closed list, I will have pulled the pages with no open items on them as soon as they were completed.  This is to keep the book light and thin.  (The downside to Circa/Rollabind is that when the book starts to bulge, the pages can pop out.)  It also keeps page flipping to a minimum ;-)<br><br>So, no messing with the way the system works, just a nod to notebook limitations.  Now to run the system and get a feel for it in my life.<br><br>Let me just reiterate how innovative your idea of doing a day long, real-time, demo was.  Wonderful.  Thanks so much.</div>

<div class="content">JD,<br><br>Yes.  Think of it this way ... AF4 does not know your context.  It has no awareness of time.  It does not know you went to bed and a new day has started ;-)  No matter when you go back to it you just pick up where you left off and follow the rules as if you never left.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>I probably explained more than was necessary and so obfuscated the point.<br><br>The way I'm using my book depends on physical pages.  IOW, if I draw the line in the middle of a page, what do I do?  I'd have to leave the remainder of the page blank, I guess, and start the new Open List on a fresh page.  I could do that, I suppose.<br><br>Or I could undo the system I just put into place and go back to  a simple notebook.  Then I could tread the whole book as a list, as you do.  But then I'd have to carry a second book for the other things I keep track of.<br><br>Ah well, everything's a trade off, I guess.  LOL ;-)  Maybe I should just find a way to work at my desk all day and then I could use a large book and not worry abount any of this compactness and portability.<br><br>I'm using the system today but have not dismissed yet so I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.<br><br></div>

You will pull out only the pages with the dismissed items, and in worst case you'll have a page with a lot of dismissed items, a divider line and the first task of your current backlog. For a while, because one day, this backlog will become dismissed, too. That should do no harm.<br><br>Or do I suffer from a complete misunderstanding of your problem?</div>

<div class="content">I keep a divider between the two lists so a page has to be on on list or the other ... not both.  At least that is how I want to work it..  I could be making a problem where none exists, I suppose.  Today I'm going to work the list out of a new book.  Just to see how it works for me with no limitations.  Then I'll decided how I want to work it in my normal environment.</div>

<div class="content">>>I could be making a problem where none exists, I suppose.<<<br><br>Actually, I can see no reason why the new list should start on a new page. AF4 is one long continuous list, divided in parts, and for that division a simple line does the job.<br><br>I actually draw a double line ========== because it's more noticeable, and suspected myself of overdoing it... :-)</div>

<div class="meta">2009-09-6 16:58</div>
<div class="content">Andreas,<br><br>It is because of the way I use my pocket book now.<br><br>I have it set up in sections and have a divider for each section.  My AF list is in TWO sections, to cut down on flipping through pages to get back to where I was.  What I really want to avoid is leafing through pages to get to where I was or the end of the list where I am adding a new item.  So with this setup I have the beginning of the closed list, the end of the closed lt, the beginning of the open list, and the end of the open list all accessible by tabs.  That allows me to reach any page with only a few "flips".  The more I flip pages the more time is lost and the more easily the pages wear at the connection points and are prone to falling out.  Flipping is a BAD thing ;-)<br><br>So I have:<br><br>*** Front Cover<br>Priority List<br>=== Tab<br>AF4 Closed List<br>==== Tab            <which is effectively Mark's "Line"><br>AF4 Open List<br>===== Tab<br>Tickler<br>====== Tab<br>Shopping Lists<br>======= Tab<br>Current Projects<br>======== Tab<br>Blank Forms<br>*** Back Cover<br><br>As you can see, dismissal is then just a matter of removing the closed list pages, moving one "Tab" (the one that is Mark's line) and copying the "saved" closed list tasks to the end of the open list.  The effect, however is that I must work on page boundaries.<br><br>As I said, I'm working in a new book as an experiment this weekend (just the way Mark did it) and so I'll get back to implementing AF4 in my pocked book next week and will decide then if I will leave the end of one page blank, or "draw the line" at the end of the last "full open list page".  The only difference I see is that the white space on the last closed list page might tempt me to write something in it and screw things up vs. having a few tasks take another ride on the open list that they did not buy a ticket for ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Why not just have a small sticky note to mark where you left off, and use the regular old line across the page to mark the closed-open list boundary? <br><br>It seems like what you'd want to find MOST frequently is the place on the list where you left off, not the beginning of either the open or closed list. <br><br>If you use your tab as a divider, don't you also waste the whole back side of a page if there are just a few items on the front? I guess I'm not visualizing the benefits of the tab in between.</div>

<div class="content">>>What I really want to avoid is leafing through pages to get to where I was or the end of the list where I am adding a new item.<<<br><br>Yes, sure, but actually in AF4 you only have to find two places: the end of the list (to add a task) or the begin of the backlog. (Plus, you might want to find back to where you were before you added a new task... but that's another subject.)<br><br>So, the end of the list is no problem in your system.<br><br>The begin of the backlog is no problem, too, at least no big one: It will be somewhere on your first sheet of paper. <br><br>The divider between backlog and open list, however, needs not to be found, because you only enter the open list once you passed through the backlog one time without actioing an item. So, by definition you have arrived at the divider then.<br><br>But I'll stop here. Of course the main thing is that your system, however you organize it, has to please yourself and make you feel comfortable with it. If it works for noone else, who cares?</div>
