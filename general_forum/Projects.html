<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>I am very eager to try the new system out!<br><br>I work from home as an accountant so have listed all my "jobs", or "projects", in my A4 notebook... but initially all I seemed to have done is made a huge list of each job in the corner of my office, so when I look down the list I still feel a huge amount of resistance to each project... nothing really "stands out" as it were - do you think this is because I'm not breaking each "job" down enough - please help!<br><br>I am also a little confused where to put daily tasks, such as e-mail, voicemail, paper, that sort of thing... I always clear yesterday's e-mail first thing the next morning, for example... how would the new system accommodate that?<br><br>Jason</div>

<div class="content">Jason:<br><br>First of all make sure you are doing it properly. It's not just a matter of "looking down the list". After you have read quickly through the page, you should start moving down the list using a pointer (your pen will do) to stop momentarily at each item until one stands out. Then do as much work as you feel like on that item, cross it out and re-enter it if necessary.<br><br>If that's not happening for you, then it would certainly help to break the jobs down further. It will probably take a little while to get your mind accustomed to the fact that it doesn't "have" to do anything.<br><br>Daily tasks should be entered on the list like any other task. in fact you will probably find that your response to email is greatly speeded up and you clear it more than once a day.</div>
