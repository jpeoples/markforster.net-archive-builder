<div class="content">Hi Folks,<br><br>Are there still avid DIT users on this forum?  I have some colleagues that I introduced to DIT a while back and one of them has a question that I am not sure of the answer.<br><br>If one receives a document via email to read/review or edit, does one circulate this back and forth from the two inboxes that Mark describes in his book until it is done, or should one put this on the Diary for a task for tomorrow?<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Hi David, <br><br>I would say either option is fine. But in each case I would list it in the task diary to show incoming work, even if it's being re-circulated. <br><br>Re circulate the document if only a small time is available each day to read the document. If enough time is available 'tommorow' then it could be done in one go.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Leon,<br><br>Thanks -- this sounds very reasonable.  My answer would have been to list it in the task diary and then relist if for the next day if not quite done.  <br><br>So how are things going with DIT?  Is it still working very well for you?  The colleagues that I have mentioned have continued to use DIT even through the versions of Autofocus and now DWM as they think it is the best time management system that they have ever encountered.  And these are very bright, accomplished professors in medicine, physcis, and engineering.  The one thing they point out every time -- one can focus on today's work without so many distractions.  A very powerful factor indeed.<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Hi David<br><br>I'm still doing DIT as my primary method. I use it for email; I collect up all today's mail and process it in one batch tomorrow. I also do the same with paperwork. It works beautifully.  I find it very helpful when a new project arrives, to put it on tomorrow’s list and know that I can start working on it then, and completing it (hopefully) well before the deadline. DIT helps me cope with the ‘distant elephant’ syndrome extremely well. There is something extremely powerful about having everything I need to do today on one page. I can also work ahead if I choose, by working on future tasks once today’s tasks are complete.<br><br>I have tried  DWM a couple of times but seem to have a mental block with it – I can’t make myself put a task that I KNOW needs doing tomorrow in my diary 30 days ahead.  I know I should not regard the pages as dates but I think my difficulties are because I am very calendar-focused. I struggled with all versions of AF to some extent because tasks on the task list were not tied to dates. Also, having choice over the tasks allowed me to procrastinate too much over the tasks I didn’t want to do.<br><br>I’m a bit surprised, to be honest, that both Autofocus and DWM have been the subject of so much tweaking and improvement, while DIT (which I thought was a superb system) has had very little, certainly in recent years. DIT is still my preferred system and I apply my own tweaks, while is mainly not being too dogmatic about the rules and applying some flexibility e.g. if I am having a busy week then I will push a non-urgent task forward by one week or even one month, noting that it has been postponed. I don’t postpone tasks more than once. This is strangely a bit like working DWM in reverse!</div>

<div class="content">Hi David, <br><br>I actually agree with Linda's views, good points. <br><br>I would bet I've used most time management systems out there. There's no doubt in my mind that DIT, at least the core of it, is the best out there. But I guess that's because it suits my individual circumstances and personality. Although elementary, DIT works so much better for me if I have a seperate inbox notebook, something I've only recently worked out!<br><br>However, I do struggle with DIT at the 'project' level and above (eg goals etc) and I must admit I'm constantly thinking and adjusting my approach. Yet DIT is great for me for task execution and a great system for helping me not get overwhelmed. <br><br>At the moment I'm particularly interested in formal problem solving methods. So my Current Initiative is to either do 1. clear backlog or 2. problem solving (on 1 problem). This is largely because I often cannot physically do tasks first thing in the morning if I'm not in the right context, but I can usually sit and write and think about solutions. And then above the task level I've got 'active problems' (similar to GTD projects) and 'deferred problems' (similar to Someday / Maybe in GTD). After 37 years I coming to realize the enourmous value of good problem solving abilities, so we shall see how it goes.<br><br>Finally, I would welcome more DIT conversation as, over longer periods, I've not really got on well with Mark's other systems.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Linda nd Leon,<br><br>Thanks for responding.  I am glad to see some out there using DIT.  Leon, I would like to hear more about your problems with projects and goals with DIT.  One thing that could be done -- and my colleagues agree on this one and do it routinely -- is to put statements like "work on project X" on their DIT list -- and do this for every active project.  Then when one chooses this "task" to do, one goes to their project support material, which should have a list of things that need to be done, timelines, etc.  One then works on their project for as long as they feel the need -- and what else is on their DIT list.  One can use this same approach for a goal.  Of course, there is also the powerful current initiative, which is a good place for goal-oriented work.<br><br>At any rate, I would love to hear your comments on this -- Linda too!<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content"><One thing that could be done -- and my colleagues agree on this one and do it routinely -- is to put statements like "work on project X" on their DIT list -- and do this for every active project.>  <br><br>Mark suggests that a project should be handled according to whether it is a ‘continuous’ (such as learning a language) or an ‘organisational’ one (e.g. planning a marketing campaign).  <br><br>Continuous projects consist of essentially repetitious tasks and handled by scheduling specific times on one’s calendar/schedule. Organisational projects (which lead to a specific goal) consist of tasks which are not repetitive.  Mark’s advice is to break the project down into its subtasks, and then bring them forward for action by putting them into the task diary. He says “A small number of tasks can be put into the task diary for tomorrow’s date. Larger or more complicated projects can be spread a few tasks at a time over a week or more”. <br><br>Mark also identifies a third kind of project – too short to be called continuous but can’t really be broken down into sub-tasks as they are essentially repetitious. They should be re-entered in the task diary each day until complete.  His example is ‘sort out bookshelves’ which, coincidently, has been on my list for a few days! <br><br>So perhaps we should decide which kind of project it is, and then handle it in the most appropriate way. The type of project I struggle with the most is the organisational one – as it depends on how well I have broken down the project and identified the tasks and I always forget to include tasks like ‘Think about …’ or ‘Review…’ on the project task list!<br><br>Linda</div>

<div class="content">Hi David and Linda, thanks for the suggestions! <br><br>David: I have always struggled with the idea of 'work on project X', although it's a great suggestion. I suppose it works best for me if I attach a time limit to it. If not it feels too vague and I go for a specific next action instead. <br><br>Linda: Continuous projects, deadlined projects, organizational projects...I've wrestled with the definitions of each of these so many times! In the end I usually struggle to decide what type a project is and get totally confused. At face value each type seems clear, but often I feel the definitions merge!<br><br>I'd say my main problem is with knowing how (or not knowing) how many projects to take on and how to prioritise at the project level. Obviously the audit procedure may tell me when I've taken too much on though.<br><br>I've tried setting an arbitrary limit, e.g. 10 projects but of course some projects are much more involved and time consuming than others. Any suggestions?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Leon<br><br>One piece of advice I read from ‘The Power of Less’ – have a list of projects that you want to tackle, but choose only the three most important ones to work on at any one time. That’s three altogether, not three work and three personal projects. Ideally, one of them should be related to a long-term goal. Only when all three are completed should you select three more to work on. The idea is so that you don’t spread yourself too thinly and lose focus. The author says this works best when projects are about two weeks to one month long. Longer projects can be broken down into one-month mini-projects. I have tried this and found it a good discipline but hard to keep it up as new projects start creeping in when I'm not looking!</div>

<div class="content">I wouldn't say "avid" but I use it from time to time.  Do a search on "DIT" which will produce somewhat of a list of DIT users.  Back in the whole AF craze a lot of DIT posts got ignored or left unanswered in full, and Mark was in semi-retirement, so perhaps your question is answered there.  I would advocate for Mark's response:<br><br>"DO WHATEVER WORKS"</div>

<div class="content">I am finding that DWM is very much like DIT but has the flexibility that DIT was missing.  Basically everything before the today+7 page is my "today" list.  If I get all of that done, then I am "done" for the day.  But I still have the freedom to scan through the rest of the list and do whatever else needs doing.  <br><br>As Mark said, if you look at it like this, then DWM *is* DIT.  Especially when you combine it with the "current initiative" idea -- do that first thing every day.  And especially when you have recently been reading the DIT book and are trying to keep the principles fresh in your mind.  :-)<br><br>What's really really nice about DWM is that the *method* is quite simple, once you get used to it, whereas the *principles* as expressed in the book are very profound and repeated reading brings great rewards.   With many other systems (such as GTD) there are so many new details to remember to keep the system functioning.  Not a problem with DWM, once you've practiced it a little.</div>

If I get all of that done, then I am "done" for the day. ><br><br>My understanding of DWM is that all new entries go on the today+1 month page. So if you are treating the today+7 page as your today list, is there not a risk of missing some urgent tasks which are further ahead on today+1 month? <br><br>I know the procedure is to scan the whole list several times a day, but it sounds as though you are mainly scanning just the first seven pages.</div>

<div class="meta">2010-02-26 11:28</div>
<div class="content">You could argue that the urgent tasks on today+1 month are the tasks that you would write below the line in DIT. I work somewhat similar to Seraphim: I try to keep the first 7 days cleared as much as possible, and I look less often (but still several times a day) at the other pages.</div>

<div class="meta">2010-02-26 16:51</div>
<div class="content">While it is appreciated that DWM is similar -- and perhaps an extension of DIT -- I am sure there are those that will contend it is simply not the same as classic DIT.  I have explained this system to my academic colleagues who are using DIT and they all say the same thing -- if something is due today -- you still put this on the calendar one month ahead?  That does not make any sense.  I tell them about the conveyor belt analogy of things coming forward, looking throug the 7-day and one month area for things to do.  But....they are simply not buying it.  To them, classical DIT works and works quite well, and they are sticking with it.<br><br>So, my point is that if one is enthralled with Mark's new system, that is great.  But I doubt that everyone will embrace it -- there are plenty of Autofocus people and DIT people out there that see no reason to change.<br><br>Just an observation -- not meaning to be critical of anyone.<br><br>-David</div>
<h2>Reply by Linda</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-02-26 20:54</div>
<div class="content">I can agree that classic DIT can be inflexible, because new work coming in does not do so evenly, and there are times when lots of new tasks turn up just when there's very little free time to work on them, causing a backlog. So I can see in theory how DWM can help by giving greater flexibility as to when tasks are done.. <br><br>My difficulty with DWM is more to do with a loss of concentration and focus, caused by me trying to choose tasks to work on today from a large number spread across multiple pages. DWM doesn't provide me with the focused 'today' list which I seem to need.<br><br>But DIT would benefit from a better method of dealing with backlog days. I know Mark's advice is to make the backlog your current initiative. That works sometimes but not when there is no free time to institute a current initiative slot!</div>

<div class="content">Linda,<br><br>You are right on target -- figuring out a better way to deal with backlogs because of uneven accrual of tasks -- and then with days with multiple meetings -- creates a backlog all too often.  My colleagues have loosened the rules on backlogs and let if go for a minimum of 2 weeks.  If they cannot regain an equilibrium within this time frame and the ratio of completion versus new tasks keeps getting worse, then an audit is necessary, a backlog declared, and something has to be addressed.<br><br>DIT STILL is THE BEST system for assessing one's workload and overall ability to keep up.  But the current rules are a little too stiff for many of today's very busy professionals.<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">I've put in the best part of the month's trial according to the rules and I'm back to the same place I was with previous AF systems.<br><br>- Dump everything into the system (grass catcher)<br><br>- Immediately delete anything that I don't intend to do within a reasonable time frame (it used to be a week but since this is a month based system I'm tending to leave it if it will possibly get done in a month).  Since I keep the pages the old pages serve as a "someday/maybe" list.<br><br>- Every morning, cull out what I need to get done that day and put those tasks on an index card I carry in my pocket.<br><br>- Work the index card and only turn to the DWM list when I have open time<br><br>I think this sort of comes down to using a combination of DIT and DWM.<br><br>I agree that it is bothersome to put a task due tomorrow on a page for a month from now.  I understand the argument that the month away page is where the new stuff lives so it will be most easily found there.  My take on it is that it should live on the page where it is due so that I can check ahead and see it in RED ink, which is how I write tasks when they are appointments (which is also how I view a task with a REAL date due).<br><br>FWIW, I'm still getting confused over which pages to write what on.  Yeah, I move my tabs forward each morning so that I have three I can turn to quickly: Today, Next Week, Next Month.  I'm not really a moron (though there are some who might dispute that ;-) however, when I'm busy I simply get confused and write stuff on the wrong pages sometimes.  Not that I think it really matters a hill of beans where I write things ... but then, if it does not, why bother with the rules in the first place?</div>

<div class="content">If there's any truth to:  "nothing dies harder than a bad idea" then I may have stumbled upon a new rule that will eliminate the 31 day rule for new tasks due tomorrow. <br><br>I use the Current Initiative (marked as an "all day" event in iCal) 1st thing in the AM, before I start DWM. I've been doing this for 2 weeks with great results. <br><br>I'm now going to modify the "next pass" option by placing due dates of tomorrow (in Omnifocus) on tasks that I MUST DO tomorrow. These are rare, buy there are times where my clients do require next day service for certain issues. <br><br>I'll report the results in a couple of weeks.</div>

<div class="content">Or maybe another way of thinking about those dated items:<br><br>If you were doing a regular to-do list and you had a new item to add, where would you naturally put it? At the end (at least I would). If it were vital to do today, I'd circle it or highlight it or even put it on a special page of "Must Do Today".<br><br>Same with DWM. The end of the list SEEMS to be a month away, but it's really just the end of the list, and you could do all the same things to make that particular task stand out TODAY.</div>

<div class="content">ds:<br><br>I like that way of thinking about it!  In general I like this system and I like working from the lists it generates  BUT I have the same problem as Mike - I get confused when I am busy - which is when it really counts!  This is a big disadvantage of DWM compared to either DIT or AF.  Their rules for entry are much simpler, but their rules for dismissal / audit  are more complex.  I still tend  not to write  everything down in DWM - even now that I am using paper.<br><br> On reflection, as I enter more items than I dismiss - and am more likely to be in a hurry when entering than when dismissing - it seems better to ditch DWM and go back to an AF based system.  <br><br>Does that make sense?  I don't want to give up on DWM without good reason!</div>

<div class="content">Hi David, it sounds like a reasonable thing to do if the circumstances are appropriate. I personally would not want to get up to 2 weeks behind myself because 1. The nature of my work means it runs smoother if I action tasks quickly 2. I'd hate to get a few weeks behind myself and 3. It would probably mean a sizable backlog? Which for me would increase the resistance of clearing the backlog. <br><br>What do you think?</div>

<div class="meta">2010-02-27 20:47</div>
<div class="content">Hi Leon,<br><br>You make good points.  In fact, I have heard colleagues tell me that when they do indeed wait two weeks, the backlog is of considerable size.  Their real problem is that they simply have too much on their plates and they keep running into backlogs -- instead of trying to figure out ways to deal with the overflowing plates.  No time management system will help if you simply have too much to do -- even within an 80-hour work week.<br><br>-David</div>

Mark is one of the few writers I have come across who says that sometimes we just have to do less.  <br><br>The first time management book I ever read was 'How to Live on Twenty-four Hours a Day' by Arnold Bennett.  Which sounds a little like the key idea of DIT, that we should aim to match our work to the time we have available.</div>

<div class="content">David<br><br>Regarding a 2-week backlog, I don’t tend to let the backlog get beyond a week if I can help it, but it depends on the circumstances. If the backlog is a clear, temporary state of affairs caused by a specific situation – say an illness, or a big project which has taken priority over everything else – and will end within a couple of weeks or so - then I’ll accept the fact that other things will start to back up. <br><br>There are periods of intense work in my job, interspersed with quieter periods and in the intense parts I will be working evenings/weekends to keep everything going. Other parts of my life will slip particularly home and personal tasks. I have a minimum “will do” list for home and personal to keep those ticking over as best I can. <br><br>What I find most helpful in a backlog situation, is to sit down with my task diary and calendar and review ALL my tasks and the commitments both delayed and upcoming. Delayed tasks fall into three categories – 1) no point in doing it now as the next recurrence of the task is coming up in to next few days or the commitment/meeting/appointment it was in aid of has passed. 2) I still need/want to do the task soon, in which case I will re-enter it in the task diary for the next day when it is possible to do the task, and fix a time slot on the calendar as well to highlight it 3) I would really like to do the task but can’t really commit time for it at the moment, so I enter it on a Someday/Maybe list which I review weekly. When things get really hairy, I do this review on a daily basis. <br><br>That only works for short, temporary backlog situations caused by specific circumstances. When backlogs happen a lot, or becomes the normal state of affairs then I agree with other posters that no time management system can solve the problem of too much work.</div>

<div class="content">David<br><br>I have tried a number or the AF incarnations but drifted back to DIT.  I found that I could add new tasks with a due date of tomorrow using most of the iphone todo apps and that made it really click.  Together with setting up my routine tasks to repeat on workdays it gave me a really clear picture of my day.<br><br>I pretty much add everything for the next day if possible.<br><br>I am a teacher though and a key problem I have is I do not have the same amount of discretionary time each day - Monday I might have just an hour, Tuesday half a day.  This means that the work that comes in Monday I might not have time to complete Tuesday.  I get around this by sometimes adding tasks for later days if I know I will not be able to do anything with them the next (kind of scheduling the big rocks for the week).<br><br>I have a try with DWM but found cycling round so many pages distracting.  Lots of my task like lesson planning and prep have very short turnarounds so DIT helps more with the daily focus.  <br><br>The key to success with DIT is discipline.

<div class="content">A question for you DITers. If a big project comes in, it automatically is slated for tomorrow. Then after you work a bit on it tomorrow, does it automatically get sent to the following day and so on til it's done? My problem with this is the number of projects that can pile up with various deadlines. Do you make these the current initiative? I'm in the middle of several big projects. I'm ok with doing a bit on them daily but there is also a sense in which I want to work a bit and then wait a week to work some more. Any thoughts?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mel<br><br>I deal with Projects in the way Mark recommends in DIT (Chapter 14).  Continuous projects such as learning a language aren't suitable as a Current Initiative as they are too long term.  These are best scheduled in time blocks on your calendar - I'm not dogmatic about this being daily, just regular enough to complete the project it's target date.<br><br>Organisational Projects, such as writing a sales proposal are scheduled for the following day but I may, if time permits, work on it over several days, employing the little and often idea Mark promotes.  It will depend on what other work I have to complete on the days in question as to whether I complete it in one go or break it into sections. Another example of these type of projects would be "Organise CD collection" which as you suggest, I might complete as a Current initiative.<br><br>Hope this makes sense.<br><br>Steve</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mel, <br><br><< ...there is also a sense in which I want to work a bit and then wait a week to work some more. >> <br><br>I don't think this is a problem at all. When I feel I have brought a project 'up to date' (this will look different for different projects) I will often write it into the task diary for review in a week or so. Particularly if I have delegated some aspect of the project to somebody else.</div>

<div class="content">Hi again Mel, Appologies in advance for this, my longest ever post!<br><br>The 'continuous project' concept seems easy to understand and manage (as SteveH shares). I would certainly advocate blocking regular time for these sorts of project. <br><br>However,  I feel 'project speak' can get confusing. Particularly as many of us come from a background of using GTD Project terminolgy, i.e. a project is essentially anything requiring more than one action. <br><br>Mark Forster's attempts within DIT to delineate projects by type are illuminating. But in my experience I tend to spend too much time trying  to define a commitment within a project type. <br><br>Moreover, the Current Initiative concept never really works for me. Partly because I never have discretionary time in the appropriate context to make use of it. And also because I feel it tends to open the flood gates somewhat in relation to taking new things on.<br><br>As a result, I have re organised my DIT approach a little to suit my own needs. It includes some themes from the Power of Less by Leo Babauta. As I have very little discretionary time (it's my lunch break now!) it seems to work well for me. Here it is:<br><br>Will do List<br>-------------<br><br>Smart Outcome 1: Review 30 Day Challenge & Update yesterday's inboxes<br>Smart Outcome 2<br>Smart Outcome 3<br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>My page for today,<br><br>Smart Outcome 2: SET UP MY CYCLE FOR COMMUTING WITHIN 2 WEEKS<br>Smart Outcome 3: COMPLETE A MINIMUM OF 80% PHYSIO EXERCISES OVER THE NEXT 3 WEEKS<br>30 DAY CHALLENGE: Evening dental routine<br>Review Tom <br>Arrange visit with Dick<br>Calculate telephone bill<br>Label up Orthodocs information<br>Update Smith <br>Review Jones<br>Hip exercises 1<br>Hip exercises 2<br>Hip exercises 3 <br>Collect bike from bike shop<br>Draft People Handling and Risk Assessment session<br>__________________________________________<br><br>Speak to Lisa about tomorrow<br>Taken telephone call from Mrs Bennet<br><br>Basically, I have 3 main things to focus on per day. As soon as I have updated my incoming work from all sources (which will include 'project' related actions) I can then focus on the two other Smart (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time bound) Outcomes that I myself have set. <br><br>I feel better updating my work from yesterday first, before working on my Smart Outcomes, but each to their own. <br><br>I have spare pages in my diary for 1. Potential Smart Outcomes and 2. Potential 30 Day Challenges.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Leon,<br><br>Your list seems to indicate a pretty good amount of work, and it all appears to be discretionary (i.e., not bound to a specific time block).  If you have very little discretionary time, how do you get all the work done?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Seraphin,<br><br>Well actually my discretionary time is much more limited at home i.e. before and after work, as I have 2 young children. I start work around 07:30 and probably have around 3 - 4 hours discretionary time available at work, on average. Which to some people may be a lot! <br><br>Most of the tasks in my example are fairly short, even as little as 5 minutes. The 'little and often' principle is working effectively.<br><br>Of course the will do closed list helps to keep the focus, which in my opinion is the key component of effective self management. <br><br>If I get more than 3 days behind on a task, then it's backlog time. The backlog supercedes the 2 Smart Outcomes until it's cleared.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Markj, <br><br>It's Leo Babauta's concept (Zen Habits website / Power of Less Book). It's simple but effective and requires persistance!</div>

<div class="content">I use DIT and love it. Tried Autofocus (not for me) and DWM sound strange to me. Don't want to try it. Tried GTD for many years, but it's overwhelming. You spend more time organizing then you actually do stuff. DIT is according to me the most powerful system. It's closed lists, the Current Initiative and the will do list. Just works perfectly on my brain.<br><br>You do need a project list etc, aside from DIT. But to get you focused and going, DIT is the best. <br><br>Especially now that I found a great iPhone app that works perfectly with DIT. It's called Dunnit! Before I had a analog moleskine - 1 year calendar. Since the iPhone is always there and I can use Dunnit!'s task repeat for the will do list and stuff I do repeatedly, the whole process just becomes automatic. You don't have to write down stuff all the time. It gets super fast. It's like I found the fountain of time management.<br><br>Check it at <a href="http://dunnitapp.com" rel="nofollow">http://dunnitapp.com</a></div>
