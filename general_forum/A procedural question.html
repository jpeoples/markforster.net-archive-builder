<div class="content">This is a question about recurring, low urgency tasks, such as checking e-mail, --something which I can do obsessively if I'm not careful.<br><br>Do people put tasks like these on their lists? <br><br>It might be a bit silly to have to keep going down my list until "check e-mail" stands out.  It might be easier just to check it as soon as the impulse arises, and be done with it.<br>On the other hand, having to scan my list before checking my e-mail might reduce my desire to check it. And I might find myself doing a more challenging and interesting task instead. <br><br>Any thoughts on how to deal with tasks like these?   (For instance, a task like checking in on this discussion group. which I often do four or five times a day....)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Steve<br><br>Personally I put check email on each page.  I do find that by checking email when it stands out means that I clear it more easily - and I have tried it without adding it into my lists!  You may find the FAQ's helpful - obviously the section on dealing with emails but also the section on Minor/Routine Tasks (What To Include)<br><br>The link is below<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/645945" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/645945</a><br><br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Steve,<br><br>I think what goes on the list depends on what you need prompting to do.  I.E.  would you put "put on my socks" , "tie my shoe laces" on the list?  I doubt it.  However, if you had a severe neurological problem you might ... because it might not get done otherwise.<br><br>I don't put "check email" on my list because I don't operate in an email driven environment.  The worst that would happen if I failed to check it for a few days is that some people might wonder what became of me ;-)  If I did operate in such an environment, then I'd go to some kind of "push" system where it would be beeping at me constantly.<br><br>I do a lot of reading and researching.  But that is so important to me that I don't forget anything so nothing goes on an AF list.  I just have time blocked in the early AM and go to work then.  What I do in particular is driven by what I was last doing and I know what that is so I just let it flow.  I do keep extensive notes and some of those notes are about other things to read ... BUT, I don't AF them because they will mature on their own.  IOW, when I review my notes I'll see that I wanted to read something and I'll do it, or schedule a task to buy the book or whatever.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">My reason for putting "check e-mail" on the list was not so that I would be prompted to do it, but rather so I would delay in checking it until it came around on one of the list. I was hoping to put a buffer between my impulse to check e-mail (which can run rampant) and the act of checking it.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Steve<br><br>I find that putting it on my list DOES create that buffer (and weirdly makes it easier and not so much of a chore) and also enables me to schedule the more pleasurable reading and responding to other emails, more appropriately<br></div>

<div class="content">Steve:<br><br>That's an important point you make. It's also one which was very much emphasised in my book "Do It Tomorrow". What we are trying to do is to get away from the random impulses which keep people answering email or web-surfing all day and instead to deal with these subjects systematically. So it is indeed important to put this type of action on the AF list.<br><br>If some of you have a compulsion to check this Forum all the time, you can imagine what it's like for me! But I keep the whole thing well under control by dealing with Forum posts only when AF says so. The same with Email. The same with Facebook. The same with Twitter.<br><br>On the rare occasions I allow myself to deal with these things without AF "approval" it's sometimes hours before I come back to what I'm supposed to be doing!</div>

<div class="content">Since I still struggle to get through my complete list at least once a day and since I cannot afford to check my professional email at least once a day I don't put "check email" on my AF list. On the other hand I don't have the problem that I feel the urge to check my email every other minute. I do it 2-3 times a day.</div>
