<div class="content">I'd love to purchase a copy of "How to make your dreams come true", but no luck so far. <br><br>First, I ordered it from Amazon directly when their website still stated they had it in stock. Unfortunately, they were unable to fulfil the order. At the moment, none of the several Amazon websites (.com, .co.uk, .de, others) lists the book as available. <br>Then I tried to order it via Amazon Marketplace but I either got no response from sellers when I asked if the book they offer is really available, or a negative one. Right now, there is only one offer on Amazon.co.uk for a used copy, for the ridiculous (sorry, Mark) price of £186.55. On the German Amazon site there are two offers as an "obtain title", but I don't trust those offers, as I know how hard it is to really obtain it.<br>I also tried to get it from a bookstore in my city that specialices in UK and US books (I'm in Germany), but only got the information that none of the wholesalers has it and a reprint is "pending". And they said that with this publisher (Hodder & Stoughton) that can mean "... for years". <br><br>Does anyone here know a reliable way to get hold of a copy? <br><br>Or is there anyone in this forum who has the book and is willing to part with it? <br>If so, please send me a message to alxwz.test AT gmail.com (please note that the "test" part is real). <br><br>-- <br>Alex</div>

<div class="content">Oh, I just noticed the blog post: Sold out and no reprint. <br>Sigh. <br>Still hoping someone is willing part with their copy.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for reminding me, Alex. I need to chase the publishers about releasing the distribution rights back to me.<br><br>Mark</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br>Have you considered setting up "Dreams" (and your other books) to be sold for Amazon's Kindle?</div>
