<div class="content">I'm looking for a system to assist me with my challenge. So far I have not been able to stick to either DIT or AF for any length of time.  Perhaps there isn't a "system" answer to my challenge, but at least I'll post a question to this forum. This is my challenge:<br><br>I have a great ability to focus. I will feel compelled to get ONE thing done until I'm finished. This is usually some type of "Current Initiative." The problem is everything else on my list will get held up. Sometimes for more than a year. Usually I'll use the AF list for a while until some "Current Initiative" pops up. So I tend to do work on each specific task in bursts and spurts. I can keep honing my "current big project" until I feel it's just right. The AF list fades into the background, and the other things are left sort of half done, as they've lost their "charm," if they had any in the first place. Here's one example:<br><br>I wrote a masters thesis this spring. Just about everything else got put on the back burner. My family for one. The house. The garden. The car. All the things I had listed in my Autofocus list are still on there. I simply parked everything until I got the thesis done. It got done, and it got done really well, btw.<br><br>The challenge is, life doesn't stop. Other family members get cross, or at least frustrated. My way of prioritizing is to do what compels, and most of the mundande tasks are "parked." Of course I still pay the bills, because I have to, but most stuff gets parked. I tell myself I'll get to them "later." However when "later" arrives I'll stick with the AF list for a while, but usually some new fresh and exciting project is usually already in the pipeline. <br><br>In a sense it's a way of procrastrinating. <br><br>So, with this profile in mind, would there be any thoughts on what kind of system could assist me in getting progress on the unmotivating tasks as well?</div>

<div class="content">Occasionally I do one thing to the detriment of much else, but not for long weeks.  I think your focus ability is a great thing, provided you balance it a little.   Assuming your ONE thing has real value and is worth lots of time daily.  Ideas:<br>1) Set a time limit per day.<br><a href="http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/time-management-how-an-mit-postdoc-writes-3-books-a-phd-defense-and-6-peer-reviewed-papers-and-finishes-by-530pm/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/time-management-how-an-mit-postdoc-writes-3-books-a-phd-defense-and-6-peer-reviewed-papers-and-finishes-by-530pm/</a><br><br>2) Set a time limit within your day.  Pomodoro technique for up to 2 hours, Then 1/2 hour must do AF list.<br>3) For most people, the advice is to first of each day work on the big project.  Maybe you need to first work on something else.  Your reward for staying current is you get to do the fun project.</div>

<div class="content">I do not think you have a time management problem.  You obviously have the ability to focus and get stuff done as evidenced by your thesis completion.  It seems you are perfectly happy with what you are doing but others may not be.  So the question you have to answer is how much do you want to do things to improve your relationship with others.  If you want to do some of the things that please others you will need to consciously put them into what ever system you choose and put some focus into them.  This decision is not really a TM decision but a goals decision you must make.  I limit myself to three goals at once, so if you made improve relationship with ABC a goal or house, car etc , you would work on that a bit each day, meaning some of their priorities.<br><br>Good luck<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">It sounds like perfectionism and obsession should also be considered.<br><br>Try Covey's books. One of them has you identify your roles (usually 5 to 12) and identify one goal for each role each week. Consciously thinking about each role each week can make a big difference.<br><br>Also see life-balance wheels. Some weeks have to be unbalanced, but more than a few weeks unbalanced in the same way leads to problems.<br><br>Sometimes doing something that's not part of the current obsession is uncomfortable. The more you do it, the easier it gets. Baby steps.</div>

<div class="content">Gadgety:<br><br>One way of handling this sort of excessive concentration on one thing is to play to its strength and see everything else in terms of it:<br><br>You need to take exercise to have mental clarity for THE project<br>You need to pay your bills so worrying about them doesn't distract from THE project<br>You need to spend time with your family because that's THE project's ultimate purpose<br>Your car needs to be maintained so it doesn't break down and take time away from THE project<br><br>etc etc.</div>

<div class="content">Have you looked at the toolbox for Aspergers' Syndrome? Obsession is one of the common symptoms.<br><br>(I'm not saying you have it, just that the AS community understands the problem. I'm not particular which toolbox I raid, if it has a tool that works for me.)<br><br>Congrats on the Masters!</div>

<div class="content">Thank you all for your suggestions! Some really useful stuff in there. I really like the idea of doing ONE little thing before diving into the BIG project.<br><br>I'm curious about the distinction between Time Management decisions and Goals decisions. I've always thought they were sort of the same; i.e. good time management is the result of clear cut goals. But of course upon reflection, I am indeed having one very clear cut goal, but only one, so I sort of disqualify the management of time and make it irrelevant, in a way. Have you got some more on on the distinction between those, Gerry? <br><br>I admit that the Aspbergers comment threw me a bit at first.</div>

<div class="content">Gadgety,<br><br>In theory time management should flow from your goals.  Practically speaking many of us work a job and do not pursue all of the goals we have because of the time commitment of working.  You can be a very good time manager and gets lots of stuff done at work and yet never reach your personal goals for a variety of reasons.  This topic has been one I have studied.<br><br>As I personally explored this it caused me to design a couple of time management programs as well as a goals program trying to solve some of these issues.  My philosophy now revolves around a rule to limit goals to three.  I have found that short goals lists actually completed lead to the achievement of much more in the long run as opposed to laundry lists not getting done.  <br><br>If you would like my goals program, send me an email and I will send you the pdf.  This offer is open to any forum members, send me an email with your forum name and I will invite you into the original beta test site which has the file for DO IT as well as the discussions that took place this year.<br><br>Gerry<br><br>desiredoutcomes@gmail.com</div>

<div class="content">Unless your goals cover all aspects of your life, that can't be a complete basis for time management. Goals do help you set aside the irrelevant, but it sounds like they go to far in your case.<br><br>I went through an exercise recently where I tagged every activity, every item in AF, with a category. I grouped and generalized and analyzed and thought deeply about all these. I discerned 7 major areas of my life and discerned how these fit into 2 broad life Purposes.   I found some activities didn't fit well, and others are better aligned. From this I am slowly changing how I spend my time to better things. Yet all 7 areas remain vital, so any particular goals (eg 5 for the next 3 months) must be balanced by the 2 and the 7.<br><br>But all this is a tool to choose tasks. Managing them (AF) is also needed.</div>

<div class="content">Gadgety,<br><br>If you can "pay your bills because you have to", it sounds like there is hope. <br><br>I wonder whether you also have some routines which you follow because you have to (brushing teeth, ...). The point about routines is that they don't appear on your internal priority list, so you don't feel that they're distracting you. <br><br>If you have a few weeks respite before your next big thing, try investing them in building some strong routines to support you when your next enthusiasm sidles up to you with a welcoming grin.</div>

<div class="content">David Allen's latest book "Making it all Work" covers looking at your life from various altitudes, something which he mentions but doesn't cover in detail in GTD. GTD focuses on today and this week.<br><br>This podcast<br><a href="http://annebachrach.hipcast.com/rss/goal_setting_systems.xml" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://annebachrach.hipcast.com/rss/goal_setting_systems.xml</a><br>has some good episodes about the wheel of life and life balance.<br><br>Covey's still the best for goals and roles. Best read in order published.<br><br>Don't worry too much about the AS. My son has ADHD with some AS traits, so I see it everywhere. Most of the tools recommended for him are useful everyone.<br><br>BTW, don't make reading all the books and trying all the systems into another obsession. It's also good to re-read them a year later, when your life has changed. Only the lessons you're ready for at the time sink in on each read.</div>

<div class="content">@ Gadgety<br><br>You seem to be very much like me. This was one of the things that made me think that I didn't need a Time managing System since I don't procrastinate on the big things I have to or want to do. Here are a few ideas and concepts that helped me.<br><br>Time Management is the art of Efficiency. It is how to be able to be productive with every ounce of time that you have. It is looking at things at a Micro level. It is therefore good for those that lack or those that work best with that kind of Focus. It's very close to tactics which is defined as a level of "Means" to get the job done.<br><br>Setting Goals is the art of Effectiveness. Goals are not "Means" but "Ends". They cover what is most important to you and they should be considered with a different kind of mindset and tools. It is looking at things on a Macro level.<br><br>Both of these are not necessarily self exclusive but it is difficult to reconcile both ways of thinking in one system or even one taught because of their different nature.<br><br>You are an Effective person and that is what drives you. You are inspired by creating change more then in maintaining what is already there. There is not shame in that.<br><br>From your question, I gather that you most need Balance and Flow...<br>Balance in your maintenance of your life (mostly efficiency things) and your Projects (mostly effective alterations to your world). And Flow on when to do one and when the other. So here comes a new concept:<br>Life Management or what some call Life Style Design.<br><br>In a nutshel, Life Management is the Art of Balance and Flow. It recognizes the power of Effectiveness and the necessity of Efficiency. It emphasizes doing what is the most important in the most efficient way. It is looking at things on a Macro level to then dive in the Micro level. Life Management is an "End" and a "Means". It is a kind of "It's not the destination that's important, it's the journey". It's NOT "The End justifies the Means" but rather "The Means are the End".<br><br>In my experience, Balance is best handled through budgeting (any kind will do but I budget time through Pomodoros). Flow is best handled with actually visible objects that you can throw in the stream of time.<br><br>I always was a Single Tasker. I cannot leave a thing unfinished and I will often not start a project if I don't have time to finish it in the same go or else it will stay on my mind. Using time management systems has wreck havoc on my nerves because they encourage the mindset that you can eave something open because it's on a list and you won't forget. It just doesn't work for me. So limiting my work in progress at any given time has always been at the core of my thinking even though I couldn't define it.<br><br>It was when I discovered about the Personal Kanban (and Kanban) in general that the concept of WIP (work in progress) was made clear to me. And now I apply it everywhere and it works like a charm!<br><br>You should definitely look at your projects and your maintenance as 2 different aspects of your life needing different "levels of attention" and "kinds of engagement". Mind map a tree of those with the Maintenance as your Roots and your Branches as Projects and your Goals as your Leaves or Fruits. You'll see why and where maintenance is vital to great Projects :)</div>

<div class="content">Yes, the WIP concept has helped me focus my efforts, rather than going off in ten directions at once. Balance is tricky one, that is where the Pomodoro helps me, stop and do something different. <br><br> “Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance you must keep moving” - Einstein</div>
