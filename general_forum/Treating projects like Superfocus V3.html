<div class="content">This morning I made a good clean up of everything. I was very upset because I could not see  anything. Too many folders, to many papers, too many tools, to many of to many. <br>So I started to make the big clean of all. Suddenly i realized I had no project about my own organization I could not put it on SF because the project was huge and I wanted to focus for a while on it. So I took a sheet of paper and start thinking with a pen. I listed a few tasks i could do to make it better. I.e i looks like a simple AF1 list. BUt I thought I wont do it immediately. Some tasks can and must be done now but others may be in the future. So may I treat the project like a SFV3 list i.e with an urgent column and so on to focus on the most important things first. I thought I could then put in my main SF list work on project X and the goto the main project to do it little by little. Do you think it's a good idea ?</div>

<div class="content">Sounds fine to me. But:<br>- I think you won't fill even one page, so most of the SF rules won't do anything. But do this anyway.</div>
