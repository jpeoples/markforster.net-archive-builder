<div class="content">I've only started using AF very recently. In fact today was the first day that I used the system consistently.<br><br>What I found interesting at the end of a long working day, is that I went home without taking any work documents with me as homework. My past experience was that I used to take work home, but I never looked at it once I reached the house! With AF in mind I assessed my situation realistically and rationally: I had had a long day at work; I already had my home AF list on hand; I was mentally exhausted. All these facts helped me make the right decision, which was not to take any work with me to be done at home. I made this decision and felt wonderful about it. No feelings of guilt! Moreover, on the way home I was actually looking forward to perusing my home AF list and actually completing several tasks on it.<br></div>

<div class="content">Ah but were you feeling less guilty because you got more done at work, or because you didn't mind as much?<br><br>I've found I feel a lot less guilty too because I don't spend the day feeling like I'm doing the wrong thing. I'm always working on the thing that my time, energy levels, or short term deadlines are best suited to.</div>

<div class="content">David,<br>I didn't feel guilty because I had finished a good day's work, there was nothing really urgent to have to take home, and I could concentrate on doing my home tasks.</div>
