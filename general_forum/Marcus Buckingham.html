<div class="content">Has anyone read any of Marcus Buckingham's books (i.e. "Now Discover Your Strengths").  I've been looking at them on Amazon.com and they sound very intriguing.  However they also sound as if they overlap.  And I wonder if anyone has read Mr. Buckingham and could recommend a particular book with which to start.<br><br>Conversely, if anyone believes that Mr. Buckingham's book are worthless, I'd love to hear about that, too!<br><br>Thanks as always.<br><br>Steve</div>

<div class="content">I was a bit reluctant to post on this, but, you also asked for negative reviews.<br><br>I recently returned to Now Discover Your Strengths because a book that I read recently extolled it highly. I originally read Now Discover Your Strengths many years ago. It was of no value to me then and of no value now. And the book that I read that extolled it was of negative value.<br><br>I am not saying the idea of doing work that builds on your strengths is bad. It is good. Do work that builds on your strengths. But I haven't seen a book yet that has told me any more than what is contained in the previous sentence.</div>
