<div class="content">I like to observe my productivity with AF. How many tasks do I add each day and how many do I close?  The first number is easy to count but not the second. <br><br>I created a simple hack as follows. When I cross off a task with the pink highligher<br>(indicating completion) I draw a tally mark agains today's date. If I dismiss a task, then I use the fluorescent yellow marker.  The extra effort involved is so minimal .. maybe 0.5 seconds per task.<br><br>Now I can glance at my diary and see very quickly if I am tending to close less tasks than I am adding or more.  Over the last few weeks I appear to be falling further behind, so I need some concentrated time to do more work or to dismiss some items.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Charles. A great tip - so simple and yet I hadn't thought of it before. It will solve my problem of how to keep a tab of completed/dismissed items, which I've been puzzling with for some time.</div>
