<div class="content">I have long been a fan of writing in one place which has been a cornerstone of my systems.  Currently I am using a system which continues this theme and is a bit of a combination of elements of AF and a system I wrote about and called noted based time management along with some of the concepts in the Simple and Ultra Simple Guides to time management.  Basically what you do is start a legal pad or notebook with an AF type list of everything you need to do.  You can use as many elements of AF as you want to process the list.  <br><br>As you have things come up you simple add them to the AF list.  If you have meetings or conversations you simple use the same legal pad to take notes.  Voila, your whole life is now in one place which for me creates peace of mind.  <br><br>The key to making this work is to review the notes and only pull the notes pages off when you have added to the AF list what needs to be done from the notes.  You can then file them if they may be needed later, or toss them.  <br><br>As pages of the AF list get completed, simply tear them off the pad and toss them.  <br><br>When the pad is filled use this as an opportunity to do a review and start a fresh pad or notebook.<br><br>Good luck<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">Gerry,<br>you say that you write everything in just one pad or notebook. How do you treat confidential data and information, e.g. private information about a task that you don't want everybody to see when you are at your workplace or office? Or isn't that a problem for you at all?</div>

<div class="content">Not a prob for me Rainier. My work practice (re: Gerry's suggestion) is to take a legal pad to meetings or anywhere I want to do some figuring on paper. A task in OneNote calls for me to review these notes and transcribe anything important into AF. Then I slash across the reviewed note with a highlighter.</div>

<div class="content">I forgot to mention that I have one notepad for work and I use a steno pad for personal stuff, which has a cover, so when it is closed no one can see it.  At work , there is not too much I need to keep confidential.  If I jot a not on say someone compensation, I will just simply flip the other pages to make sure it is covered until the note is filled.<br><br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">+JMJ+<br><br>I have always tried to implement the One Place Rule ever since I dabbled into USGTM early this year.  I now use it by always writing whatever information I get at the back of my CAF notebook, and (since I am using a 3x5 notebook) I use an index card box with moveable separators to catalogue my torn-out notes when needed.  The whole thing is my project files system now ^___^<br><br>God bless.</div>

<div class="content">My base system is one book for all my incoming notes, which goes with me everywhere -- groceries, meetings, doctor, everywhere. Each page has the date and topic in the corner. I use a code while writing. Any action item gets a circle on the left which is checked when the item is processed (either done or moved to another part of the system). If all the action items are done I clip the corner. If I could happily tear up the page except for the binding or something on the other side, I put a big X through the page. If I can tear up only part of the page, I put a line between "garbage" and "keep" and put an X through the garbage. I make it very easy to tell if a page needs attention or not.<br><br>Eventually, I go through and tear out (or photocopy) the pages and put them in other folders, but meanwhile I know where to find them. I used to leave the notes in the book and make an index, but found putting them in folders by topic worked better.<br><br>At home I have a task book. There's nothing in it worth archiving, just things I need to remember for few days. Sometimes the task is to write something in a more permanent location. That book is also my AF/SF book.<br><br>I had a separate "work" book when working, but if I thought of something from the other context, I wrote it in whichever book was handy. I reviewed each book every few days.<br><br>As for privacy, my everything book is mine. I trust my family and coworkers not to snoop.</div>

<div class="content">I have tested a new system, in fact improved an old one which is to do all with omnifocus including SF and notes . I tried it for a week and it is working well. I will finish to improove it and may be write a thread on my blog and a summary on MF blog.</div>
