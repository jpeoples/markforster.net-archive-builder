<div class="content">Hi Folks,<br>We have a new starter in our organisation who has asked for some advice on time management and prioritisation.  She has a desk job (marketing apprentice) which requires her to remember and keep track of tasks and projects she is given as well as manage her own initiatives. <br>I've offered to give a short intro to some time management tools, and wondered what approaches people would recommend for someone new to the workplace?  DIT?  Simple Scanning?  Mark's recent Willpower exercise? <br>I'd recommend she reads Secrets of Productive People or DIT, but that would have to be a follow up. <br>Thanks for any input!</div>

<div class="content">So many options...<br><br>Simple Scanning is hard to beat.<br><br>I think AF4 would be another good suggestion. It's a simple and elegant way to manage workplace tasks.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Colin,<br><br>I love Simple Scanning, personally. I also think the most effective system will end up being a very personal choice.<br><br>I am cautious though. I have used the various 'standing-out' systems in busy work environments over the years and have become comfortable with add-ons like the 'Panic List' to help me when things became a bit urgent and overwhelming. I wonder if dealing with a flood of new tasks and responsibilities as well as, possibly, having a lot to learn is the best time to also try to experiment with standing-out and other concepts of the long list that have been discussed on here over the years. <br><br>Perhaps DIT is a more useful approach initially. It provides instant structure and instant peace of mind in knowing a task is recorded for tomorrow. It also provides quick feedback on overwhelm which might be useful for someone who may feel they need to say yes to everything at this point.<br><br>If it were me I would start with the simple framework of DIT to get things under control. If they seem interested I would share details of long lists like Simple Scanning. Then they are free to experiment with a framework already in place. I'd also point them at this blog as a fantastic resource.<br><br>Matt</div>

<div class="content">P.S. Also wanted to add FV as another recommendation for a "new starter." Another simple and elegant system. It's very easy to grasp and well-suited to the office environment.</div>

<div class="content">I second AF4. This is the one I teach my staff first, I think it is the most intuitive with the least level of overhead.<br><br>The other book I give new hires is (and this may be heretical) is "The Getting Things Done Workbook: 10 Moves to Stress-Free Productivity." This is not the book written by David Allen, but a much simpler workbook that is very helpful for someone who does not have good "inbox processing" skills.</div>
