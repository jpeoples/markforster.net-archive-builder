<div class="content">I was busy when the switch to DWM started and did not follow everything.  Now I want to try this system but have some basic questions that I feel I need to answer before I can delve into this system which sounds very promising, hope you guys can help:<br>1.  For a paper and pen approach what can I use.  I cannot find any "journal" at any of the local office supply stores that meets the requirements that Mark set forth.  I am in New England, and have had no luck so far.<br>2.  Are there any good simple digital solutions.  I use a blackberry and Outlook 2003 at work but am open to an online set up such as Evernote or anything Windows based.  I would want something that I can use at the office and at home, and is somewhat portable as I am in the car frequently.<br>3.  I have a number of items that need to be done either the same day or the next day every day.  I also have many items that are more like projects.  For the items that need quick turn around do I still write them down 30 days out?  I understand the theory but it seems odd to do that when it must be accomplished in 24 hours or less.  <br>Any help would be appreciated as I do not seem to be able to get started with this new system and I would like to give it a shot as so many people seem to find it to be working for them.  <br><br>Thanks, <br>Larry G</div>

<div class="content">Larry,<br><br>Forgive the brief reply but I've covered a lot of this before:<br><br>1) If you can't find any kind of calendar planner or journal, just take any blank notebook and put the dates on the pages at the top of the page ... thus making your own planner, if you will.<br><br>2) I've written extensively about using Toodledo as an electronic solution.  It is free and syncs nicely with the iPhone, among other things.  I'm not sure it works with the Blackberry but if it does not have an app for that, you CAN link to the site with your phone's browser.  They have an address for a format designed for the phones.  Just do a search on this forum on "toodledo" and you'll turn up a number of posts.<br><br>3) You ALWAYS enter items 30 days out.   That means nothing about when you will do them.  As you ALWAYS enter new items 30 days out, you KNOW that the new ones will be there if you need to find them quickly.  There is NO prohibition about working on that page immediately if you need to.  Some of us use a tweak: we write hard due dated items on that dated page in red ink to distinguish them as a hard due date.  YMMV, of course.  Mark would say use a second calendar.  That seems redundant to me.<br><br>I hope that gets you started.</div>

<div class="content">Larry,<br><br>Outlook tasks work fine. Group by date due and use the keyboard shortcut (can't remember the 2003 shortcut - <alt> VX something, I think) to close them all to get a daily view.<br><br>You can set up a view that filters out completed and overdue tasks.<br><br>To date the task, have due date immediately after the subject. Type in the task, <tab> type "mo" for +month, "w" for + week.<br><br>You can set up a user defined Y/N column to flag the current task and set up formatting to highlight it. (And the same for "next pass" tasks if you use this refinement).<br><br><a href="http://screencast.com/t/MDEwMmM3Y" rel="nofollow">http://screencast.com/t/MDEwMmM3Y</a> .<br><br>If you have your task list set up in a separate window, it is simple to drag mails into your task list.<br><br>If you have a number of daily recurring tasks, you might like to set these up on a separate list and just put in "Morning recurring" on your DWM list.<br><br>Where I get tasks which relate to existing commitments, I put these in the +w page immediately.</div>

<div class="content">Larry -<br><br>1 - I'm in New England too and Staples had a project planner from AtAGlance that looked exactly what Mark ordered for DWM :) <a href="http://www.ataglance.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/catalogSearchrnav_-1_10052_10002_64211_12__64201_0_10052__false_Y_Y___64202" rel="nofollow">http://www.ataglance.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/catalogSearchrnav_-1_10052_10002_64211_12__64201_0_10052__false_Y_Y___64202</a>  (OTOH, I'm using a Moleskine Cahier (for DWM-home) and wrote in the dates myself)<br><br>2 - I use a simple excel (DWM-work) spreadsheet (input date, new/continued, expire date, description) so electronic doesn't need to be anything complicated<br><br>3 - Ditto what Mike said (although I don't use the red-ink tweak)<br><br>Lillian</div>

<div class="content">I appreciate the input so far.  I am experimenting with both Outlook and Toodledoo.  Unfortunately, Toodledoo does not work great with the blackberry and entering into outlook is a little more complicated.  I will keep working with them unless there is another option that someone else can think of.  Did my first day today, did not put everything into the system but definitely felt more productive today.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Larry,<br><br>I'm using ListPro on main notebook and HTC Smartphone (WM 6.5), the developer  www.iliumsoft.com/ offers some BBY solutions.<br><br>R</div>

<div class="content">I am using Remember the mil now, synced on my android phone (with the official RTM application... ).<br>It is not a perfect system but it is the least bothersome I could find as ar PC/android syncing solution.<br>The android app has nice features, and I make good use of tags to write contexts.</div>

<div class="content">Larry,<br><br>You might look at Evernote (the free version should be enough) as a possible solution.  You could number "notes" or date them as "2010-03-02 Tue", for example, then they <br>would sort quickly and you would have something that reflects a paper implementation.  <br>You might do the same thing in Google Tasks, for example.  That is also a free solution.<br><br>I suggested Toodledo because of its folders, contexts, tags, prioritizing, sorting, searching, and filtering.  That is my reason for going electronic.  Without that, why bother?  But I'm sure you'll find a good solution.<br><br>One thing that might be bothering you is the size of the BBY screen.  My neighbor got one and after the iPhone it looks just awful (to me).  So maybe your electronic implementation might reflect the size of the screen and make one "page" exactly the size of a BBY screen.<br><br>You might also download the trial version of Pocket Informant for the BBY here:<br><br><a href="http://www.pocketinformant.com/products_info.php?p_id=pocketinformant_bb" rel="nofollow">http://www.pocketinformant.com/products_info.php?p_id=pocketinformant_bb</a><br><br>I have not tried it, of course, but I do like their iPhone implementation.  I particularly like that it integrates well with Toodledo.  I work with Toodledo on the web on my laptop, then sync my PI with it so I'll have my list in my pocket on my iPhone.  I can manage the list there, checking off as I go and adding new items, then when I get back to the computer, I can sync again and clean things up on a full sized keyboard.<br><br>Lots and lots of possibilities ;-)</div>
