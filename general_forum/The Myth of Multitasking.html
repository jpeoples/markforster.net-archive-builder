<div class="content">Hi Mark and All,<br><br>If you have not read the new book by Dave Crenshaw entitled "The Myth of Multitasking: How "Doing it All" Gets Nothing Done", I would suggest you do so!  This is right in line with DIT!  Per my posts here and the great responses from Mark, this book really hit home for me in terms of many of my days.  <br><br>Best to all,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Gee, Mark...no reply at all?  I thought you would have been very interested in this book.  It is one I think all should read and it is right in line with the principles of DIT.<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Unless it asks me a direct question, I don't reply to every post. But I do read them all. So please don't think that lack of a reply from me means lack of interest. <br><br>Mark</div>
