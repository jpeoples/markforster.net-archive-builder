<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-04-7 11:58</div>
<div class="content">One of the things that AF identifies is that a lot of the tasks we used as procrastinators in the past are actually things that need to be done.  That eliminates the guilt over doing those things and helps increase our motivation as we see that we are actually getting necessary tasks done.<br><br>However I have found that there is sometimes a need to "take a break" and a great way of doing that is to define specific "allowable" procrastinators - which are actually still tasks that need doing, just may not be on the list :-)<br><br>For example, I have "make coffee" on every page and "check email", both of which are easily used as procrastinators, as can "check discussion forum".  They are all "necessary" tasks - I need to eat and drink, I need to check my email, and I need to check the forum as the ideas from there help me identify how and why AF works so well.  However, sometimes I am working through my lists and I hit a page where nothing stands out (shock horror!) but I have items on that page that I know I do "need" to do so cannot dismiss.  I may have already identified the reason for resistance to those items but if I am not in a position to dismiss them must action them.  Under AF rules I must Do or Dismiss - I cannot just leave the page and move on.<br><br>However it may just be that I am tired and need to take a break!  If it is not appropriate to take a real break, actioning one of my procrastinators "for as long as I feel like" enables me to mentally stop, allows my subconscious to relax, and when I return to the page say 10 minutes or so later then invariably a task will leap straight out at me. By virtue of the fact that the tasks are specific and actioning them will still be of benefit, the time is not "wasted".<br><br>That is just something I have found that helps me.  It is important to use specific "necessary" tasks, rather than just wandering off to mindless surfing or something unnecessary, but does enable me to get over those "tired" moments.  There may otherwise be a temptation to "break the rules" and move on without doing or dismissing - we can become very creative at finding reasons why we should not "do or dismiss" :-)</div>

<div class="content">Very interesting. I also think seeing things that have been completed and crossed off the list creates a sense of momentum that carries you forward. Just being able to cross out "make coffee" reminds you that you're doing something and pulls you toward the next thing.</div>

<div class="content">Because I have "make coffee" on every page it also frequently gets left as one of the last items on a page - being able to "use" that task rather than the last one or two high resistance tasks somehow prepares my subconscious to make a Do or Dismiss decision on the next cycle around.</div>

<div class="content">Christine,<br><br>This week I have noticed the same pattern: I sometimes leave an "easy" task (make tea, sit up straight!) on a given page so that I have more time to deal with difficult items on that page.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Natalia<br><br>I think because AF is such an effective system that we can spend so long "being productive" that we forget that we need to take a break sometimes.  When i first started doing AF I actually forgot to eat a couple of times! Sad huh?</div>

<div class="content">I started AF the first day Mark released it and gave up on it after 3 days. I took a break for a day and then tried it again. I have been doing it ever since.<br><br>But, the mod that I had to make was to use 2 books. One book is a standard AF list (spiral wire horizontally across the top of the page). The second book is a smaller notebook which has a dual purpose. I take notes in it, for example, when I am on a phone call. And, each day, I tape into it a list, which I print out from Excel, of about 25 recurrent daily tasks. Some of these tasks are time sensitive--like turning off some machines in our office at the end of the day--and some are not--like checking the balances in the business' bank accounts and remembering to put moisturizer on my hands (at least during the winter months).<br><br>I also have in the list some journaling tasks that I do daily and a task to review all my e-mail.<br><br>My list of scheduled appointments is in Outlook.<br><br>Throughout the day I look at Outlook to see if anything is scheduled. If not, I work off my AF list and my recurrent list. <br><br>My understanding is that orthodox AF would have me throw out the recurrent list and enter those items either into my calendar or into the AF book. I do not do that for the following reasons.<br><br>1. Some of the items on this list I really want to do every day. And I don't want to have to rush through my AF list to find them. <br>2. Many of these items do not have to be done at a specific time. So, I don't want them cluttering up my calendar. Instead, I like to see them cluttering up my desk, right next to the AF list.<br><br>What I have found is that my recurrent list offers another variant of structured procrastination. I can take a break from my AF list to do something mindless on my recurrent list. Then I can go back to AF.<br><br>I have been doing AF this way since January 9 or 12 (I can't remember). It has the decided downside of being more complicated that pure AF. But I will gladly sacrifice simplicity for effectiveness.</div>

<div class="content">Moises:<br><br>I'm interested in learning more about your method.<br><br>How do you decide when to do the items on the Recurrent List? Do you just do them whenever you feel like doing a few? Or do you do them as if they were part of the AF page you are currently working on? How do you ensure that they all get done every day?<br><br>Have you tried out more than one way of doing this? If so, what worked for you and what didn't?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark<br><br><<Q1. Do you actually write these three "allowable procrastinators" on every page, or do you have them on a separate list, like a bookmark or index card, or just have them in your mind? I'm always interested in how these things are physically accomplished as that can make quite a difference to the way one approaches them.>><br><br>I have "Check Email" and "Coffee" on every page and use them if they are available on a page I get "stuck" on but my use of them (and checking the forum) as "allowable procrastinators" is more from a "just in mind" basis.  Basically I use the "make coffee" option to take a break, giving my subconscious time to adjust to the remaining tasks on a page.  I generally give myself permission to check email or the forum while I drink my coffee in that it is "a break" and the time taken to drink a cup of coffee naturally limits the time spent (although in practice I rarely finish the coffee before starting back on my lists).   Also, when I action the "check email" task on my AF list that will generally include filing of mail.  If I do an ad hoc check then that merely looks at any new messages so that I am aware if anything urgent comes in that needs actioning.  If so I will deal with it there and then, or write it on my list.  That means that, even if "check email" does not stand out for a while, I know there is nothing urgent in there - sort of the equivalent of reviewing my AF lists on a regular basis.  <br><br><<Q2. You told me a while ago that you'd never dismissed a task. Does this still apply?>> <br><br>No - I now have plenty of dismissed tasks :-)</div>

<div class="content">Like Moises, I cannot do without my Daily Recurrent list of 25-30 items.  I have no desire to keep re-entering these in AF and besides, the list is roughly in the order I am likely to do these things in a day and so my Daily list helps to give shape and direction to my day.  I used to tick these off as I did them but this became too much of a "project" so now they are on a permanent A6 card on my desk and the list is revised about once a month.<br><br>I work from home and so I experience the need to "structure" my day in a way that those who go out to work may not need.  However, even my Daily List and my AF list are not sufficient to keep me on track.  I also need to take stock several times a day.  Trying to schedule a whole day has never worked for me at home.  So I take stock whenever I feel unfocussed and I plan the next couple of hours.  This "plan" is entered on a Post-It note and stuck on the same card as my Daily list.<br><br>A Mini-Plan might read:<br>2.10pm Daily list<br>2.20pm AF<br>3.20pm Nap<br>3.50pm Walk and Shower<br>4.50pm AF<br>5.50pm Cook dinner<br><br>After dinner I might enter a new Plan on the Post-it note...etc.<br><br>So essentially I have two items on the desk<br>1. My AF Book<br>2. An A5 size card which contains the Daily list and the Post-It mini plans. (Each day, I find I need to do about 2 or 3 or 4 of these mini-plans to refresh and refocus my attention.)</div>

<div class="content">Mark Forster's questions and my answers:<br><br>"How do you decide when to do the items on the Recurrent List? Do you just do them whenever you feel like doing a few? Or do you do them as if they were part of the AF page you are currently working on? How do you ensure that they all get done every day?"<br><br>I just do them whenever I feel like doing them. It is a closed list.<br><br>Many of these items have a "preferred time." Some of them have a preferred time because it really is better to do them between 8:00-10:00 am or after 5:00pm, for example, and others because I just tend habitually to do them as morning or afternoon items. <br><br>This is basically a checklist. Most of these things I do habitually, but, I never know what's going to happen on any given day, so I like to check these off to keep track of any that I might have missed. <br><br>I ensure they all get done the same way I used to ensure that my DIT list gets done. I just make sure I do it by the end of the day.<br><br>"Have you tried out more than one way of doing this? If so, what worked for you and what didn't?"<br><br>My only alternative was straight AF. But I felt a lot more pressure with straight AF. I felt that many of these items were pulling me, but I didn't want to break out of the AF sequence. <br><br>Now, breaking out of the AF list is included in my rules. I have my closed AF list and my closed recurrent list. <br><br>Somebody recently mentioned "management by walking around." One of the items on my recurrent list is to walk through all three floors of our building each day. That is an item that I can do at any time. At some point, I break off from my AF list and decide to let everyone see me walking around and checking things out. <br><br>I do try to cycle through AF once a day, but if, on occasion, I can't, I still know that I will check my email, go through my inbox, take a walk on all three floors of our building, review the previous day's report of orders shipped, empty my tickler, change out the backup cassette on the server, look at my calendar, etc.</div>

<div class="content">Moises<br><br>Your Daily list serves almost exactly the same function as mine.  Elsewhere on this forum, someone made a distinction between recurrent items and routine items.  Would you agree that what we have on the daily list are routine items?  (Recurrent items appear repeatedly, maybe several times a day, maybe once a month, maybe every six months).  But routines for all of us are a necessary means to deal with essential things.  I guess I use my Daily List as a means of fostering useful routines.  Many of the things I do habitually were once on a list.  Once the routine is habitual, it is normally dropped off the list.  <br><br>Furthermore, I find that I link these items in different ways.  For instance, there are 5 or 6 things I always do when I first sit at my work desk in the morning.  There is another group that I do just before lunch.  Most of the things that are on my list would be done every day even if I did not look at the list.  However, the checklist is always there just in case I lose sight of some of the routines I have painstakingly devised.  I no longer tick them off when they are done.  I have found this to be unnecessary.  If I occasionally miss a few, it's no big deal.</div>

<div class="content">Christine<br><br>Back to your "allowable procrastinators".  One thing of value that I take from this thread is that there is a real value in having a number of easy and attractive items on the AF list since otherwise the list may frighten me off if it feels like a constant drudge,<br><br>But, like Mark, I cannot quite see how items like "have coffee" actually get on to every page.  Is it that such items are routinely entered at the top of every page way ahead of time or is it that every time you have a cup of coffee you enter it at the end of the list because you intend to do it again when it comes up spontaneously?  (If I did it this last way, I would probably finish up with "have coffee"  3 or 4 times on every page.)<br><br>This is not a frivolous question.  It is on that goes to the heart of how AF functions.  I have a slightly uncomfortable feeling that I may not be using AF to its full potential.  (For instance, I have been using AF from Day One, but I have completed only about 1000 items.  Whereas I imagine that many other members of this forum have complete 5 or more times as many items as this.)  However, I do not expect AF to run my life.  I do not work "on list" 16 hours a day.  At a rough guess, I would say it would be maybe 3-4 hours a day.  (N.B. I am semi-retired and working from home.)<br><br>So you see I am quite keen to explore whether I can use AF to better advantage for myself and this "coffee" question is one that might help me to refine the way I use the AF list.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Christine:<br><br>I'm still not quite sure how having "Coffee" etc on every page works. Do you have it in a separate box to one side? Do you cross it off when you've done it, or just leave it there? Or what? And why don't you just have a cup of coffee when you feel like it? (which is what I do!)</div>

<div class="content">In spite of what others have written in this thread about recurring items, I have had no problem with putting them in my AF list as normal tasks. In fact if anything I've found that the system works even better with this sort of item than it does with other types of task. Nor do I find it a chore to re-enter an item once I've done it. After spending 15 minutes on "Email", just how long does it take to write the word "Email" at the end of the list?<br><br>So while acknowledging that others have had a problem with this, I confess to being a bit puzzled by it.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jim<br><br>With reference to the "coffee" item, I routinely enter it onto every page but do not readd it when actioned.  I start each page with the same four items - "Check email", "check schedule", "coffee" and "thinking time" and I end each page with "transfer list to OneNote" (which ensures I keep my Digital version up to date and takes approx 3-5 minutes per page).  To be perfectly honest my "system" of adding those first 4 items was accidental.  Early on in the AF process, when my notebook pages kept falling out, I changed notebooks and rewrote the existing pages.  It just happened that my new book had 38 lines to a page rather than 34!<br><br>I maintained the process because it has proved valuable to me in that they are all important items which I might overlook (eg check schedule) or slip back into bad habit on (eg check email).  Coffee is important as when I am really engrossed in something (such as my lists) I frequently forget even to drink which is not sensible, and Thinking Time (which I either use for planning or to specifically write down some of my thoughts and ideas) is invaluable and something I frequently gave insufficient attention to.<br><br>Yes these items are all simple and it is definitely a relief sometime when you hit a difficult page to have something which creates a breathing space, and of course in some cases I will use those items to enable me to move on to the next page, knowing that the next time I get back to the page I will have to "do" or "dismiss".<br><br>However my "allowable procrastinators" of "coffee" "email" and "forum" are effectively off list items.  The list items I treat in the normal way as above. My "allowable procrastinators" are a device to keep me working through my lists when previous habits would have had me giving up (or mindlessly procrastinating).  I think the key is the fact that rationally I now want to work on my lists - I now want to get things done, but intuitively there is resistance or I am just plain in need of a break.  If something is rationally important to us, previous habits would often have us "just doing it" or scheduling it, or somehow structuring our time to accomodate it.  Now that I want to be actioning all tasks with the benefits of AF I have a reluctance to use the "just do it" option more than necessary.  Taking a break by means of what is actually a beneficial task, allows my intuition to take a break, and to work more effectively when I am ready to move on, even if I do have to "just do" some important tasks.  At the end of the day, all three of my "allowable procrastinators" have a limited time span.  I can only drink so much coffee - if there are only half a dozen new forum posts how long will it take to read them? and if my inbox is relatively clear how long will it take to deal with? (and if not, well I'm unlikely to spend hours on email - my lists will soon call me back:-)<br><br>I hope that makes some sort of sense - my "every page" tasks are there to ensure action at the appropriate time, my off-list allowable procrastinators are a device to enable me to stay focused (or return to focus) productively.<br><br>As for number of items - 1,000 items cleared sounds pretty good to me!  Despite having dumped backlogs in minute detail into my lists I have only cleared just over twice that number so it sounds as though everything is going well.  In your situation of 3-4 hours a day you may not need these methods.  When I have a full day to myself I will spend from say 8:30 am to 6:00 pm , plus a couple of hours in the evening, so that makes for a pretty long day.  The thing is that I genuinely enjoy the sense of achievement so it is not an effort as such but my intuition knows that I still need to take a break!  <br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark<br><br>I started the above post before your question (had to leave it part way through with it being Frantic Friday!) but suspect that it probably answers your question.  Basically my "on list" coffee task is primarily to remind me to stop occasionally whereas my off-list coffee (which like yours is when I feel like it) is also a technique to enable me to recharge before making that dreaded "do or dismiss" decision.<br><br>I do agree with you about "email" - the problem though with a lot of open pages is that a task such as that can end up to far ahead if only added when actioned.  Assuming I only check email say once every 6 pages or so, then each pass through will still leave sufficient unactioned email tasks to keep on top of my inbox.<br></div>

<div class="content">Christine:<br><br>There's still something I'm not clear about with your "on every page" method. When you have taken action on one of the items, say you have a cup of coffee, do you :<br><br>a) cross it out? <br>OR<br>b) leave it uncrossed out?<br><br>If a), doesn't that mean you *don't* have the item on every page. At the rate I drink cups of tea I wouldn't have any "Cup of Tea" items on earlier pages - I'd have used them all up long ago!<br><br>If b), why not just have them on a separate list (or indeed just keep them in your head)?<br><br>On your second point, I very rarely find it a problem. However if I did feel that I was unlikely in the normal course of working the list to get to a certain item by the time it needed to be done, I would put it on a separate slip of paper which would act as a supplement to the page I was currently working on. However I hardly ever find I have to do this. My temptation in the early days was to put far too many items on the supplementary slip. Nowadays I find I get to nearly all of them in plenty of time anyway - so using the slip is very much the exception rather than the rule.<br><br>In addition, looking at my list I see that "Email" doesn't just appear on every page - it frequently appears two or three times on a page. That happens naturally by using the system in the "orthodox" way.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark<br><br>If the item is on the page then yes I do cross it out - it is treated just like any other AF item.  As it's main intention was to remind me to stop occasionally it still does so, even if it has been crossed out!  However, if I hit a page with say three items on it, two that I have to do but am resisting, and coffee, then I may use my "coffee" item, knowing that next time I reach the page I must "do or dismiss".  If I don't have that item then I may still go and make a coffe, but will come back to the page knowing I must "do or dismiss" now.  And you are right - My early pages have no coffees left!<br><br>Email does sometimes appear more than once on a page.  Interestingly it is not actioned as frequently as previously (although my quick scans will identify if anything urgent comes in).  However, each time AF has allowed an email backlog it has prompted me to manage my mail differently.  For example I am currently in the process of creating a set of categorisation rules for ease of filing.<br><br>I do think that if I had less pages I may do things differently.  When I hit 15 active pages I started to panic but now, with 50+ active pages AF still works amazingly well.  However I do see that volume as requiring some adjustment to technique, such as the above, and these techniques have really evolved from having so many pages.  I guess for me it is sort of testing AF's limits - and not finding them wanting :-)   <br></div>

<div class="content">The problem with a task that we want to do daily, is that, if it is put on the list once, and readded when actioned, then it relies on a complete cycle through the lists each day.  Where that is not possible, having the task entered on each page easily solves the problem.  If I work through say 10 pages, I have up to 10 opportunities to do that task.  (As the number of items per page reduces I will generally be cycling through more pages so still have sufficient email tasks open).</div>

I don't put things on the list like walking the dog or checking email (routine items) or unloading the dishwasher (common sense) or many deadline-oriented things like paying bills or responding to something right away (I just "do it now").  So I probably do use it more like you do, for maybe 4-5 hours out of the day.  <br><br>I kind of like a mix of things like this, I don't have to ever worry about missing a deadline, I do a lot of things when it makes sense to me - although I'm sure AF could handle all of these things, I don't want to have to work with the notebooks all the time either.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">moises:<br><br>My own experience is that items like "email" and others that require checking at least once a day and sometimes more get done very efficiently with AF. One can always come up with theoretical cases in which they wouldn't but my experience is that these are relatively rare. So for instance today I have only been able to work on my AF list for a few hours, but I have checked my email twice and am dealing with comments for the third time today. I have not found it necessary to put any items on a supplementary list.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>How do you do it? Do you cycle through the entire list multiple times or do you stay on the last and next-to-last page. Thanks.</div>

<div class="content">Moises:<br><br>Well, I do it by sticking to the instructions! :-)<br><br>When I first started off with AF I found that I would do only a few items per page, which resulted in cycling through the list quite rapidly.<br><br>As my list has grown in size I have found that I am doing a much larger proportion of the items on a new page. So of the 34 items per page in my current notebook I will do probably more than half the first time I visit it. Spending this long on a page means that that I am usually working on the last one or two pages. I only go back and circulate through the remaining pages every two or three days or so. This works fine because I will already have dealt with the more urgent items.<br><br>The point is that these have both resulted from simply obeying the instructions as written. I do not make a conscious decision about how long I am going to stay on one page.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>I have a home AF and a work AF. I have little discretionary time on weeknights, so my home AF only gets actioned on weekends. At home, I always have only 2 or 3 active pages. So I do not have any kind of secondary list. Furthermore, I use autofocus.cc at home and I changed the settings to 22 lines/page as opposed to work which has, I think, 34 lines/page.<br><br>I suppose if I don't need a recurrent list at home, I could try it again at work. I do know that I will be highly motivated to get to the last pages a lot, to hit those recurrent tasks. <br>And that might be a good thing.</div>
