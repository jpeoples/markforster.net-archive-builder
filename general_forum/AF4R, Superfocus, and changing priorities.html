<div class="content">Hi Folks,<br><br>I had a spirited discussion with colleagues about the benefits of AF4R and Superfocus.  One of the issues that is always brought up is how the system adapts to changing priorities daily and weekly.  How does one change one's focus on areas of work based on the realities of the day or week.  Things can change dramatically in many fields on a daily/weekly basis.  I am not talking about the appearance of urgent things here that must be done today or tomorrow -- Superfocus really shines on that one, perhaps more so than AF4R.  But if one comes in on Monday and is ready to resume work on their AF list -- and there are emails, conversations, etc. whereby it has become apparent that one should focus mostly on a particular project or two -- or more -- how does one explain how this can be done adequately in AF4R and Superfocus?<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Ah, professors are known for their spirited discussion!  To not really answer your question, this is why I progressively organize things into projects.  Then it's REALLY easy to focus mostly on a particular project :-)<br><br>Within plain AutoFocus (any version) it's not hard to go through your list looking for items of a certain category and pull some forward to the end.  <br><br>In SuperFocus, if your project is detailed elsewhere and merely referenced in the list, you can work on it, go back to SF and do other stuff on a page, work on it, go back to SF and turn the page, pull the project forward, and keep going.</div>

<div class="content">New thought: Suppose you categorize your work by preceding each kind with a key letter.  Then it might be easy to scan only for tasks keyed by a certain letter.</div>

<div class="content"><<How does one explain how this can be done adequately in AF4R and Superfocus?>><br><br>You don't explain it, you do it. Openly and confidently, but not a big performance. Time management systems are like religion -- discussion is important, but being a nice guy to hang out with / a guy who gets things done will get more people to take the first step than force-feeding them theory.</div>
