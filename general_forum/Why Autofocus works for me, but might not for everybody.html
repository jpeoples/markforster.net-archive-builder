<div class="content">I've been using Autofocus for a couple of weeks. Well it's not been a miracle cure yet, but it's helped a lot. Here's why I think it works for me:<br><br>1. I sit at my desk most of the day, so I don't have much need for contexts. Most of my tasks I can do at any time.<br><br>2. It requires virtually no initial set up. Just get a blank page in your notebook, and begin.<br><br>3. GTD is for CEOs and all sorts of people who presumably are already pretty productive. Autofocus is BRILLIANT for people who REALLY struggle with productivity. I now don't find myself sitting around unsure of what to do -- I always can pick a "next task" easily.<br><br>4. I can throw anything into it, any time it pops into my head. No need to decide "what's the context?" or "is this an action or project".<br><br>5. In the past my to do list got so long that I spent a high proportion of my day looking through it, trying to figure out what to do next. Focusing on 1 page at a time cuts that out completely.<br><br>6. Relatively few of my tasks are 100% compulsory. The important thing is that I do the most valuable tasks at any one time, not that I tick every thing off. So having the freedom to skip stuff works really well for me.<br><br>Thanks Mark, I think it's great. Good luck spinning it out into a whole book however -- that will be a challenge. ;)<br><br>My main problem is -- once I finish a task I find myself messing about for too long before I go back, tick the task off, and move onto the next on.</div>

<div class="content">AF has clearly more focus (auto) than GTD.<br>Good points in GTD are concepts like "complete inventory" and "what is next action".<br><br>However, (at least) i'm failing with GTD since it doen't have in-built focus and also GTD has lot of setup + maintenance overhead. => AF is much more easier and lighter method</div>

<div class="content"><br>"My main problem is -- once I finish a task I find myself messing about for too long before I go back, tick the task off, and move onto the next on. " I couldn't understand. What happens when you finish a task?<br><br>My experience has been quite different.  I know immediately what to do next, something I longed to all my life (it is obvious for so many people, but it wasn't for me till AF).</div>
