<div class="content">In another thread, Tijl wrote:<br><< I notice that you have quite a few dismissed tasks awaiting review. Can you explain that? >><br><br>and Mark Forster replied:<br><< Yes. Because the range of activities I can do at the moment is quite limited I am having to dismiss a lot of tasks which I wouldn't normally dismiss. That's nothing to worry about - they can all be reinstated when I'm well again. >> <br><br>I'm not sure why, but this simple statement opened new vistas in my mind about how to use dismissal.  I had always envisioned "review dismissed items" as a task that might happen once a week or a few times a month at most.   <br><br>Since I get frequent migraines, I've struggled with working my list when I'm not feeling completely up to speed.   When I'm feeling bad, I would cherry-pick the list, looking for some easy thing to do, so I don't totally waste my day.  <br><br>But this gives me a new insight.  I can still work the list totally as normal, following all the rules, most likely doing a lot of dismissing, and making sure to enter a new task "Review dismissed tasks when you're feeling better" or something like that.</div>
