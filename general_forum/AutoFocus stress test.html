<div class="content">I posted about this earlier, but I think this site ate my post, so here goes again.  I signed up for AutoFocus on Jan 7th with the intention of giving it a 2 week trial run without changing anything.<br><br>After I read the directions the first time, I started writing my list and got a page and then a few more items on a list when I got a call from my employer.  I got laid off. I immediately added about 10 items to the list from calling to see how long my insurance was good for to updating my resume.  I had this weird peace that I could just go ahead & knock out all the job hunting stuff and get back to the rest of my list later.<br><br>For about a week, the job hunting stuff became the #1 priority and then keeping the house clean and then everything else as I could fit it in. I noticed an odd thing happen - I don't think I've been very good about dismissing stuff that should be dismissed but I find myself wanting to finish up the one or two items remaining undone & undismissed on a page just to be able to say the whole page is done!<br><br>I feel like I'm getting much more done than I was before Autofocus.  I also mentally have a list of things I need to get done for the day and normally do those first, tackle a few other items after that and then just relax & enjoy the evening with my wife when she gets home from work.<br><br>Some good news: not long after I was laid off I got a call from my old manager that they reworked the budget at work and they are wanting to hire me back. This has allowed me to go back and dismiss the few job hunting items that were not done on my list and also during the couple days off I have I can go and take care of some of the things.</div>

<div class="content">Kenny,<br><br>Dismissal is working as it should, then.  You feel as though you WANT to do the last few items so you don't have to dismiss them ... so you do them.  YAY for dismissal doing its job ;-)<br><br>Congrats on the job working out.  But think twice about canceling the resume writing.  Mayhaps you should update that resume and stat some serious networking.  Things are going to get worse for the next year and maybe you just got a wake-up call.  Maybe answer the phone?  ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Good advice from Mike, Kenny.  And it sounds as though your dismissing is working just fine ..... :-)</div>

<div class="content">Consider the phone answered... One thing I forgot to make clear earlier was that when I was unemployed, I was just looking to job to replace an income before my severance ran out and then when that happened looking to find a job that paid better than unemployment A.S.A.P.<br><br>My resume is updated from the job hunting I already did but the rest of the actions I had on my list don't really make sense for looking for a better job. They only made sense for finding a job that pay the bills.</div>
