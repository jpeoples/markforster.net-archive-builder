<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-07-1 15:22</div>
<div class="content">Having really only got back on track with AF this week I decided to work to the end of my list using AF1 and start AF2 today.  That gave me a chance to read the instructions, catch up on the comments and experiences of others, and get a feel for how I imagined it would work.  I had already decided I was going to run with my old list as it is an old friend!!<br><br>The issues I had picked up on, and on which I shared concern, were really those stated by Mike and Seraphim, regarding getting back to the beginning of the list and I read the suggested tweaks (such as the index card approach) and also Mark's response and found Mark's post on trying to combine both systems really helpful.  Knowing that Seraphim has even more active items and pages than me (as at last night I had 59 active pages and 362 active items) I felt I had a clear picture of how AF2 would work and that I would need to artificially find a way through all of those pages.<br><br>What I found was not what I expected (which illustrates the need to try something before making assumptions!!)  I genuinely found that the incentive to "rescue" the potentially dismissable item on Page 29 (my current page is 92!) did draw me back quite easily and I was surprised how many items appeared a lot more attractive than they had been in AF1.  It also highlighted to me the number of duplicated and repeated items still lurking within the pages.<br><br>The number of active pages had not particularly bothered me within AF1.  However, the need to stay current had left me doing "just one" item on too many occasions, with the result that pages hung around for far too long.  AF2 will enforce action or dismissal in a way that could be avoided in AF1.  I am also finding that I can more easily "stop when the time is right".  If there was something that had an urgency I would often work longer than I wanted to on it, because it could take me forever to get back to it.  With AF2 I can stop and start a lot more easily, and also break tasks down more easily.<br><br>There is a greater incentive to clear pages because going back from P92 to P29 is BORING!!!  There is also no need to keep adding routine items such as email to every page to ensure regular attention and I have been surprised by how many tasks that have languished for weeks are standing out.<br><br>OneNote still works well as my "digital" option.  I have had to change my procedure for update slightly but that is no problem and is actually easier.  My stats spreadsheet will work just as well and I am looking forward to comparing progress.<br><br>So far I am loving it! :-)</div>

<div class="content">I, too, was quite surprised how often I had duplicate items on my list!  I was able to cross off quite a bit once I had to read "Do X" so many times!  With a daily review that really helps with keeping repeat items off the list!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark<br><br>Interestingly, as I had my Dad coming for lunch and so could not be sure of available discretionery time from then onwards, I was pulled to action my "on notice" item this morning.  There is definitely a change to the feel of the list once that "incentive" has been removed.  It really highlights the importance you have stressed about not bringing the "on notice" items forward.<br><br>As I made my way back this morning a number of items did stand out en route and were actioned and a number of items waved as I went past, making me question whether they were waving or standing out :-) As many of them appear to have gone back to sleep it is a different process to when I was being pulled back.  I think I need to be a bit more sensitive to my tasks and perhaps resist the pull a little longer ........ :-)</div>

<div class="content">Christine, like you I had a pretty long AF list when I started AF2 but not as long as yours (about 300 tasks spread over 30 pages).  I also found that AF2's sensitivity to urgent matters is a great improvement over AF, where I wouldn't be sure when I would see something urgent again.  With AF2, I have briefly tried the tweak where I would tag important tasks with a Post-It, just to make sure I would work through the list fast enough to reach them in time. Today I realised that this tweak makes me resist working the list more than just working it in 'pure' AF2-style, because I know I'm working my way towards some tough tasks that I marked, so I've dropped the tags again.<br><br>I like your description of items 'waving at you', that's what I experienced also!<br><br>A question: you mention updating with a digital solution. How do you make that work? I've tried a combination of paper and digital repeatedly in the past, but always had to fall back on one or the other, because the updating didn't really work and made me question the integrity of the system as a whole. I'd be curious to hear how you've solved the update and syncing problem.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Nicole<br><br>I use MS OneNote which I have set up to look as close to my notebook as possible.  If you look at the following post there is more detail.<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/625963" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/625963</a><br><br>I was in the process of producing a template but that has rather fallen by the wayside over the past couple of weeks (although is still on my list!)  If you use OneNote and would like a copy then feel free to email me at mail[at]meovoto.co.uk and I'll send it to you as soon as I finish it.  My apologies to those who have already requested this and are still waiting - sorry .... :-(</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine,<br><br>thanks for offering the template, but since I'm using a Mac no need to send it. There's probably a Mac-version of Notebook in MS Office for Mac, but I'm already running CircusPonies Notebook, which is very similar to MS Notebook. I'll have a look at your setup, see how it works out, thanks for the links!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Everyone (and good to see you again, Christine!),<br><br>I prefer AF2 and the incentive to dismiss those older items, another reduction in the propensity to procrastinate.<br><br>I restarted my AF list with AF2, as Mark recommended, but use the underline technique in the AF1 to clear out the old stuff.  I use pink highlighting for Dismissed items, so draw a pink underline at the start of each day, works for me.<br><br>By having the Dismissed items still visible in pink, plus crossed out, I can always go back to review later.<br><br>As I've commented before, each of us must adapt and use the system and principles for our own situation.<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Roger J</div>

<div class="content">My initial reactions are positive too. AF2 is obviously the product of a great deal of work by Mark. While AF1 reminded me of the wheels within wheels of the enneagram, AF2 reminds me (essentially) of a Turing machine, always resuming from the same position.<br><br>I started my list afresh with five items. Yesterday my PDA threw a wobbly (as it sometimes does), so I crossed the road to buy a small notebook (35p), and copied the list into it, and am now using pen and paper (for this purpose only). I have also found I am able to have all my items (Home, Office, Studio) on the one list - this was a major issue for me in AF1, when things could be done in several places (especially when accompanied by a netbook).  I believe I am now following every aspect of the instructions. Though I have engineered my own highlighting technique (I don't want to carry an extra implement around with me).<br><br>So kudos Mark for your latest invention, and I am sure you are already thinking about AF3 which will no doubt be better still!</div>

<div class="content">After I was one of the first people to critizise AF1 when it appeared back in January I learned my lesson and kept quite for a while. I didn't start with a fresh list and work on the same list as with AF1. So far I'm quite happy: Handling of urgent and daily recurring items (like email) is much easier. But I still find it difficult to work through my complete list in a day's time - thus every day I had to dismiss the "on notice" block. But I tend to see it more as a sign for overcommitment.</div>

<div class="content">Christine,<br><br>Could you explain more about your "stats".  I spent some time this morning moving my AF list to Excel so I could design metrics to see how it was going over the next month.  "Tearing my hair out" probably over states it ;-) but without taking a month off to learn enough Excel macro programming to gather my metrics for a month ;-) I'm having to settle for a lot of manual copying.<br><br>IOW, it is a no brainer to do sums, counts, and averages on columns of the number of days a task has been open, was open before closed, and was opened before being dismissed.  I can also get a kind of "velocity" number for the list as a whole (just as soon as I figure out how I want to define that ;-)<br><br>My intention is to post my metrics over a month so it is easy to see the effect of AF2 on the way the list looks ... in an objective way.  Right now all I can observe is three things:<br><br>- AF2 is a hell of a lot "faster" than AF1<br>- AF2 is much better at getting me to dismiss things<br>- AF2 is giving me fits over tasks it wants me to dismiss but I can't.<br><br>If you would like to share this "off list" I can contact you privately.</div>

<div class="content">Mike,<br><br>It's hard to see how those stats would be a very meaningful metric of your productivity.  Since a task can be anything from "build a house" to "hammer 1 nail", comparing tasks actioned doesn't really mean that much.  Just as tasks can be hugely variable in scope, so can the action that's taken when it's crossed off as actioned.  If I browse through a book of blueprints, and put post-its on my favorite floor plans, I could cross off "build house" as actioned.<br><br>To me, counts of tasks listed & actioned are basically meaningless.  I think if I follow AF2 for the month of July, I'll *know* how well it worked by looking at what I got done.</div>
<h2>Reply by Mike</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-07-2 21:23</div>
<div class="content">Kathy,<br><br>You are absolutely right ... which is why I am not calling it a "measure of productivity".  ;-)<br><br>No, assuming that I don't change the type of tasks I enter into AF2, it will tell me how the list itself performs in processing things.  Throughput is a valid idea so long as the types of tasks I enter are of the same complexity and size ... and there is no reason to think that my mindset about what I write on my AF list will change.  Regardless of task size or complexity, so long as that does not change, the AVERAGE number of days before tasks are dismissed is instructive ... as is the AVERAGE number of days before tasks are completed.  (And note that averages are more meaningful than any single task, in my view ... this gets around the "build house" problem you note.)  Completion is a bit tricky, however.  Dismissal is a binary thing.  Completion, as defined by AF allows the same task to be completed over and over again, as it is worked on.  But maybe that all works out anyway.  Each time a task is reentered it counts toward the total tasks processed so the work you are doing really is being measured.  As I say, some more thought has to go into this so I can understand what it is I want to know.<br><br>In any case, is that not what everyone is doing now?  It is just subjective and I want to add some objectivity to it.  My reason is so that if I want to change a rule (like the dismissal rule) I can see how the throughput is affected.<br><br>It is always possible to game these things.  I could count "reading a task" as working on it and get fabulous productivity numbers ;-)  But why would I?  ;-)</div>

<div class="content">- Although I liked AF, it took willpower to make myself work through the list.  AF2 pulls me to the list.<br>- I feel no anxiety over the possibility of missing urgent or important items.  That's a huge improvement.<br>- I never wanted to read through my whole list with AF, not even occasionally.  Now I enjoy reading through the whole list each morning. I think it's because (1) it starts my day with a look at the big picture and (2) it allows me to 'record and forget' items because I know I'll see them the next day.<br>- I'm sticking with AF2/no-tweaks for the month, but one tweak I will try is picking some number of items to mark for dismissal each day - either 2 or 3 (for me).<br>- I changed notebooks from my 'large' 30-line, 13mm x 21mm Moleskine to a pocket-sized 28-line, 9mm x 14mm Field Notes.  One book, one list, always with me.  This is another big improvement.<br>- I write my list from the bottom up as Mark suggested at some point which allows me to work my list from top to bottom. That seems like a small thing, but it has made a significant difference to me.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike<br><br>I'l' be happy to send you a copy of my stats spreadsheet but I suspect it may not be sophisticated enough for your needs.  It's quite simple and track no of open items, percentage completed, and no of items added and cleared on any given day.  I've not been concerned with length of time o/s but that could be clearly identified by the addition of a date for each page if required. The spreadsheet is purely a summary - it does not include the actual tasks. If you email me at mail[at]meovoto.co.uk with your email address I'll gladly send you a copy :-)</div>

<div class="content">Having now used AF2 for a few days now I have to say that I am still loving it (to quote a well known burger chain!)  I particularly like the dismissal rule as it is far less able to be bypassed than under AF1.  It has made me realise that some of my items were still on the list because I had been able to procrastinate on them by the "only one item" option, and moving through the pages slowly had meant that my earliest item (now actioned!!) had been sitting on my list since 11 February!  A lot of the older items are items that I will do but AF2 will not allow me to procrastinate on that type of item for anywhere near as long!<br><br>What I have found difficult is going up the list, which just feels unnatural.  I have to confess to having been cheating by going backwards but reading down each page rather than up which seems to flow more easily.  I toyed with the idea of starting each new page at the bottom but decided that would also feel strange.<br><br>The other problem I face, which someone mentioned in another thread, is that of erratic discretionery time.  I really wanted to do AF2 without tweaks but that presented a problem. If I have several hours of discretionery time that is fine, but if I have only say half to an hour then I am faced with a choice.  Do I defer the dismissal rule until the next "full" AF day, or do I accept that the items must of necessity be dismissed as I will have no chance to get to them?  Neither seemed a good solution, and on the basis that the aim of AF is to get things done IF NECESSARY then I have, on those days only, done any required on notice items first, before working the list in any discretionery time remaining. <br><br>I started AF2 with my old AF1 list which I am finding a good thing to have done because it genuinely enables me to see how much easier it is to action those older items.  However, it does mean that I am working with close to 60 active pages and the action of returning to the last item each time and trawling through is quite onerous and it feels as if the boredom factor is inhibiting the standing out process.  What I have been working with today is reverting to the more "closed list" principle of AF1 and working the whole page for standing out items before returning to the last page.  That enables me do a batch of items without breaking concentration, but still maintains the constant return to the end of the list after each page.  I then work back from the end of the list again, page by page until the first standing out item.<br><br>Mark I'm sorry for trying to "tweak" the system so early on but would appreciate your comments.  No doubt you have already encountered the same problems and the benefit of your experience would be helpful. Thank you!</div>

<div class="content">Hi smileypete / Laurence<br><br>Thanks for the advice which is good advice but I really want to work through my old list items without just carrying tasks forward.  I think the lessons I am learning regarding how I had procrastinated on the old list without realising have been valuable and I am enjoying seeing my list reducing.  I think I just have to accept the boredom factor as my punishment for having let my old list grow so much!!</div>

<div class="content">I hope this is a good place to ask my question ... I had been using AF1 and then lots of family crises .. so went to at least keeping track in my AF1 notebook.  After the death AF2 came out so it made sense to I am moving over to it.<br><br>I am using this notebook for everything - I did my invoices and then put them in there so I it is easy to mark when someone has paid.  I have been going back to the beginning and marking the undone blocks ... so I want to check to make sure I am using the system.<br><br>I did some on my website (first thing that had been sitting there because it was too big and overwhelming) ... so then I crossed that off and put several smaller tasks (and the big one too) at the end of the list.<br><br>Now I have caught up on entering expenses into QuickBooks - that is recurring ... what do I do with that?  Do I just add it to the end and see when it gets my attention (it was the #2 undone block) ... also how do I add the recurring like neck stretches and such ... before I added them to a lot of pages so they would come up ... I would appreciate this clarification.<br><br>My partner just got out of hip replacement surgery (still in recovery) ... so I am still in half-functioning mode and will be busy caring for awhile.  So I am using this to keep track of things and plugging away as I can.  I have been putting data in there (like names and phone numbers that I get that need to go in revamped databases).<br><br>How do I ask for feedback without setting myself up here?  If you have a friendly tweak suggestion, it is welcome.<br><br>Thank you!<br>~ Diane</div>

<div class="content">Hi Diane<br><br>Good to see you back on the forum - hope things start to settle down for you ..........<br><br>I found a similar pattern emerging when I switched from AF1 to AF2 and find that AF2 handles recurring tasks so much better than AF1.  Like you I would put recurring tasks on multiple pages which ensured regular attention but that is not necessary with AF2.  If you put your recurring task at the end of the list, you will see it very frequently and can action it at the right time.  Then just readd it and action again when the time is right.  Similarly by jotting down things like phone numbers and suchlike to update, the list keeps them in one place and there is much more flexibility to gather those items when actioning one, as moving back through the list will probably cause similar items to stand out.<br><br>Keeping notes of invoices in AF2 is a great idea - by phrasing it as "has invoice 123 been paid" or similar then if it comes close to dismissal that is a great reminder to follow up!<br><br>Hope that helps a little?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine - <br><br>Thank you for your consistent kindness to me!!<br><br>Glad you think I am on track with these .. I think I have been using that one aspect of AF2 for awhile before it came out - because that is how I have coped with all the things piled up.  Good to hear that these uses are good.  (phone numbers, invoices ... )<br><br>Now about the recurring ... I put it at the end ... say enter data into Quickbooks or exercise ...  do I cross it off or just leave it there?  I am confused about that.  Thank you!!<br><br>Thanks again!<br>~ Diane</div>

<div class="content">Hi Diane<br><br>With recurring items you would cross it off and readd it at the end of the list.  That keeps it current.  So if for example you enter your QB data weekly, by the time you action the task it will probably be one or two pages back in your notebook.  Crossing it off clears the item on say P10 and then you can readd it on P12 (or whatever your last page is).  You will keep seeing the item each time you go through the list, ready to be actioned when it next stands out.  If you left the same item uncrossed on the list, at some point it would just end up being dismissed once it reached the front of the list.<br><br>Best wishes Diane</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine - <br><br>That is so helpful ... and so then for items that are quickly recurring - like neck exercises - maybe use the AF1 rule ... put it at the end ...say page 10 ... and don't cross it off while you are on page 10 ... but once you are say on page 12 cross it off and reenter?  So the ones that are there as a reminder to do good things for me.<br><br>Also, can you remind me ... I read a lot of the posts of the tweaking of the dismissal .. but can't go back through them all again ... wasn't there a change that draw the line - say on Mon - and then if Wed morning not done .. rather than Tues morning ... wasn't that tweak instituted?<br><br>And one more question - it (AF2) is supposed to help break down large tasks - is this just because you do something and then write more details down at the end?<br><br>Thanks again for all your help!! ~ Diane</div>

<div class="meta">2009-07-13 17:57</div>
<div class="content">Hi Diane<br><br>Sorry for the delay in replying!<br><br>I think with recurring items it would depend on the frequency of occurrence.  Most recurring items, eg make coffee, check email etc may be done several times a day and the crossing out and reentering will give an indication of frequency.  It also depends on how quickly you are entering tasks.  I would not necessarily cross out the task and reenter it on the next line for example but would if it were several lines down the page.  However, it strikes me that something such as neck exercises which you may want to do quite frequently may be better worked with some sort of regular timer at a defined interval.<br><br>There haven't been any official tweaks to the dismissal system although several have been suggested.  The general rule is that the line is drawn each day you use AF.  If you only worked the list at weekends that would give only two lines - the more you use the list the faster it becomes.  The main difficulty people have had is when there is insufficient time to work back to the on notice item and it is an item they really feel they must do.  Personally if I believe it must be done then I will do it but that is not according to the rules.<br><br>I think what you are referring to with large tasks is where the steps can all be written down and actioned as you go along more easily.  For example, on page 3 you see "upgrade PC".  You start this (crossing it off) and write the steps as new tasks, eg do backup; download software; install software; reboot PC etc.  As you then return to the last page you can action those steps easily in succession, without them being spread all over the list or being many pages away from your current position.<br></div>

<div class="content">What I have done with recurring tasks (daily or weekly) was suggested by Mark in some other thread. I set up Remember the Milk (or any other task manager) with the task name. Then when I pull up that task manager (which is daily with work) I write it on my AF2 list, then mark it complete in RTM.<br><br>For example, I would write "Journal" in RTM, but know that it means "Write Journal task on today's AF2 list). I find this is a good reminder to do it daily, but my list doesn't get too cluttered with stuff for tomorrow or next week on the list.<br><br>I've been doing the same kind of thing with future tickler items. It goes on the calendar when I will work on it. And the calendar item gets added to my AF2 list on that day or just before.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine and Dave,<br><br>Thanks!! Sorry for my delay!!  My computer went caput - that made it to the top (ok bottom) of the list right away!!  Also my partner has gotten home from hip replacement ... so I am again in the mode of just adding to the list.<br><br>But for a few days I did manage to dismiss ... hoping to be able to get back to working soon!  I think I now understand the dismissal system - I dismissed the first things the other day - and I can easily see which I will probably dismiss.  I read a couple of the newer posts and it is interesting to see the debates going on.<br><br>At this point, when I had time ... I worked from the beginning and added to the end and worked from the end.  The middle is a lost cause until my life calms down.

<div class="content">Well after nearly three weeks of AF2 I am finding my approach changing again!  The contant returning to the last page was quite a problem at the start (and I still have a similar number of open pages so that is not impacting my approach) but I am finding that the return to the end AND the reading backwards up the page is becoming the norm.  My "tweak" of keeping the closed unit benefit by working a page before returning to the end has just drifted away.  I cannot say that I am returning to the end after "every" task actioned but certainly very very frequently.<br><br>I have a much greater desire to complete so many of the older items; they are standing out more easily (and I am recognising it!) and I am identifying reasons for procrastination more easily.  Because under AF1 I had gotten into a pattern of doing tasks "because they had to be done" and therefore could not be dismissed without consequence, rather than because they were standing out, I was bypassing some of the most important elements of AF - and hadn't even recognised that I was doing so!! <br><br>As for the dismissal process ......... I find that I know instinctively when I draw that line whether I will action or dismiss the item/s.  I can also look at upcoming on notice items and know that I will get done some of those things that I have procrastinated on for months, even though I have no desire to do them "now".  So far I have dismissed 9 items and actioned 19 "on notice" items but the earliest of those on notice items was from 11 February!  I am also consistently clearing older items, making more and more inroads back through my lists.<br><br>As for number of items - on only one day since starting AF2 have my number of items increased - and that was only by 2 ..... and it was a "Frantic Friday" :-)  Although the red line is chomping through those early pages at a steady but relatively slow pace, the number of later items being cleared will inevitably make it speed up shortly, and at some point my list will stabilise.  My personal opinion is that using my AF1 list was absolutely the right thing for me (although I realise maybe not for everybody) as it has avoided the concerns about items being dismissed too soon and has not influenced me to restrict what I add to the list.  Those early pages have given me the breathing space necessary.</div>
