<div class="content">It'd be interesting to know, do any of you therapists / counselors / psychoanalysts out there prescribe AF to your clients as part of a therapy?<br><br>Also, Mark -- this may be a means for revenue?  If you packaged AF as a therapy tool, you could probably make a lot of money with it.</div>

<div class="content">I've never heard of any therapists doing so, but I know several life coaches who do. Several people have also mentioned to me that my methods are particularly good for people with ADD.</div>

<div class="content">>> therapists / counselors / psychoanalysts out there prescribe AF to<br><br>Analysts rarely, if ever, prescribe anything like AF. The "healing" occurs b/w analyst & patient vis-a-vis the transference. <br><br>CBT therapists - if provided with evidence that AF works i.e reduced symptoms - might employ this technique. <br><br>Personally, I rarely prescribe books, websites, techniques, until I have clear understanding of the unconscious/conscious dynamics occurring for a client. If I don't know the (emotional) score,  my interpretations & prescriptions will, at best, not be heard, at worst, inhibit therapy. <br></div>

<div class="content">I'm a clinical psychologist no longer in practice, but I would definitely advise those who are overwhelmed, depressed, or have ADD to use AF. But I don't consider myself an analyst or a CBT therapist. I always just used what "stood out" at the time. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">I always thought analysis worked by neurotics giving tons of their money away for talking to someone who rarely says a word, until they are so poor that they have more important things to worry about than what they usually do.<br><br>Transference is the awaking resentment of the analysand toward the analyst for taking their money. Transference comes to end when the analysand realizes their own folly and stops the transference of money.<br><br>For a therapeutic approach that fits AF well, look up DBT (Dialectical Behavioral Theory). It is one of the so-called second wave CBTs.<br><br>In any case, I am not a therapist. I just play one at work.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">I think AF is excellent therapy for depression, although perhaps not for the most serious cases.  When you're feeling down, whip out your notebook and look for a task that is "ready to be done."  Then do it, or a portion of it, mindfully, with full attention, as if it were the most important task in the world.  Cross it off, re-enter if necessary, and repeat until symptoms are relieved.<br><br>As for psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic therapy, Norman U.'s description is about the best I've come across.  I wasted decades of my life and a large fortune on this pseudoscientific treatment.  (If "pseudoscientific" seems too strong, I recommend reading Unauthorized Freud, edited by Frederick Crews.)</div>

<div class="content">>> In any case, I am not a therapist<br><br>Two questions one must remember before responding to a critic of psychoanalytic/psychodynamic therapy: <br><br>1) Are you a therapist?<br>2) If yes, have you attended a psychoanalytic training program and/or have experienced psychodynamic/analytic therapy yourself?<br><br>Here's an interesting tidbit... as a 5th year psychiatry resident, my wife was presented with a paper (authored by a psychologist) debunking much of the foundational research supporting CBT. The article was set to publish in 2010. Moreover, for the past 2-3 years, the American Journal of Psychiatry has printed study after study demonstrating the efficacy of psychodynamic psychotherapies, particularly for people struggling with personality and relational issues. Er, that's most of us. <br><br>Having spent too many years working as a therapist in addiction/mental health institutions, I can tell you that many of our "quick-fix"  approaches to suffering have little to do with quality care, and everything to do with appeasing accountants. <br><br>I'll leave you with a quote from Dr. Irving Yalom - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irvin_D._Yalom" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irvin_D._Yalom</a> - taken from his book "The Gift of Therapy", chapter 76 "CBT Is Not What It's Cracked up to Be"<br><br>"I can't resist raising one more mischievous point. I have a strong hunch (substantiated only anecdotally) that EVT (empirically-validated therapy) practitioners requiring personal psychotherapeutic help do not seek brief therapy, but instead turn to highly trained, experienced dynamic, manual-less therapists."<br><br>Side note: Most of my academic/professional training is in CBT, DBT and other forms of brief-oriented psychotherapy.</div>

<div class="content">Richard C - <br><br>To put down modern day psychodynamic psychotherapy via Freud, would be akin to criticizing dentistry for employing barbers in the early 19th century.</div>

<div class="content">I think I'm going to put a stop to discussing the efficacy or otherwise of various forms of psychotherapy!<br><br>No more posts on this subject please.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>>>>  Several people have also mentioned to me that my methods are particularly good for people with ADD.  <<<<br><br>As one who has those symptoms, I can confirm that.  Basically what it does is provide a way to make the rapid shifting attention work for you.  It also handles the short term memory problem which goes along with it (when you return from a "squirrel moment" where do you return to?  No problem, you just go to the book.)</div>
