<div class="content">Hi all, <br>me and my friends infected with AF are meeting to exchange our experiences about it.  If you feel like joining us, and you happen to be in Budapest tonight, you are heartily welcome. For details, see <a href="http://www.taskberry.com/2009/06/29/first-autofocus-meetup-in-budapest-elso-budapesti-autofocus-talalkozo/" rel="nofollow">http://www.taskberry.com/2009/06/29/first-autofocus-meetup-in-budapest-elso-budapesti-autofocus-talalkozo/</a><br>I know it's a bit late to send an invitation, but I just had the idea of extending our AF party.</div>

<div class="content">I'm still trying to get my head around the idea that people are actually spontaneously meeting together in Budapest to discuss *my* ideas!</div>

<div class="content">I suspect if anyone in the UK attempted to get their friends together socially in order to talk about a time management system, the sound of mocking laughter would probably exceed authorized Health & Safety levels.</div>

<div class="content">Nice initiative,  but same as Frank,  I don't have the necessary friends. Last time I went to Budapest I was not even able to see end meet Wilhelm Storitz<br><br>Frank:<br>A continental view is that social gatherings in the UK are likely to exceeds Health & Safety levels anyway.  Although this side of the channel is not better, I heard last week someone complaining about being kept the whole night awake by drunken students (with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 8 and less).<br><br></div>
