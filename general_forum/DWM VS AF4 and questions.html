<div class="content">Still testing DWM. For the moment the system keeps efficiently tracks of my works. <br>The 1st rule : task reformulated goes on next week N+7days is intesting. I noticed that following my stuff is more easy and is much better to track my action and stuff of the current week. More it gives me a deadline to finish what must be done like for example doing actions about important project which tasks are reformulated. <br><br>The secont rule put new task on day+30 days is not very efficient for me. I have to jumps many times a day to see where my urgent tasks are and i nearly missed an important one because i just forgot to do it as i was so occupied with my next week tasks. <br><br>There are also some others things i don't know how to solve. In my job i have things to follow on a certain part of time. Ex. Let's imagin  i send a building teaser by email to a cllient I  need to follow it carefully during 7 days. So I plan on the next 7 days "Send buiding X to client NNNN " so I considered it as a reformulation and not a new task because i have to act on on the 7 days (make a call for example IN the 7 days) but I have other tasks to do about the building and for the client which are new task such as collect plan, collect taxes, call the owner to let me know for how much he may accept a negociation and so on....<br>With AF 4 it was simple I put it in a batch and it was done little by little. With DWM it's more complicated. <br><br>Anyway I try to folloxw the system and really think that there are good things in it such as the paper one page diary, the following of tasks little by little, some principle of AF4, the natural elimination of dissmiss tasks but on the other hand it's is much more uneasy than AF4. Wich was really very fast and esay for following stuff. I use to cross all non applicable task at night one by one. <br><br>For the moment i can not judge which is for me the better system. One thing is sur in a month i shall HAVE A COMPLETE  AF4 list with a DWM metodology....</div>

"<br><br>It seems to me that *all* urgent tasks will either be on page 7 or 30.  Put a bookmark on that last page so you can find it.  Then simply watch yourself so you don't get stuck in the middle when urgent tasks may be lurking.</div>

<div class="content">@Alan "With AF 4 it was simple I put it in a batch and it was done little by little. With DWM it's more complicated. "<br><br>Why can't do this exactly the same with DWM?<br>-- oups i didnt explained that ! Well i work on projects for ex a buiding. There are somme steps about them one is the study, the other is the making of the teaser, the 3rd may be to select the targets and so on... With DWM if i got the system all new tasks has to go on page 30. But if i want to follow my task i need to have them all together on the same track of the project. IN AF4 they were all groupes now in DWM the are for a part on day 7 and another on p 30 it's un easy...<br><br>Thanks for the urgent things i didnt caught this.... I did it naturaly i didnt know there was a rule about it. I thought i made a trick... one more !!!!</div>

Otherwise, the moment you added non-project tasks and then re-added one of the project tasks, the grouping would be destroyed as well.<br><br>I also don't see the benefit of trying to do project management with a task management system. If the project steps are so closely related that you want them  together so you can do them in order, why not enter the first of them or simply "work on project x" and then pull out your project plan? Or if they are independent from another, why try keeping them grouped all?</div>
