<div class="content">I have a question about this SAFv3 rule:<br><br>"2. Column 2 is treated as a part of the page along with Column 1, with the difference that all tasks in Column 2 must be actioned before moving on to the next page. No unactioned tasks may be left in Column 2."<br><br>Does this mean "must be actioned or it gets dismissed"?<br><br>Or does it mean "MUST be actioned", as in you either DO it or DELETE it?<br><br>Or does it really just mean "MUST be actioned", as in DO it, or you may as well stop calling it SAFv3?<br><br>Does "dismissing" those items have an adverse effect on the system?   Or is that actually how it's intended to work?<br><br>Thanks!</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br>I think I would put it as high as MUST be actioned or accept forever after that you are a spineless wimp who has no right to be taking up valuable earth resources!<br><br>But seriously, if you start letting yourself out of completing Column 2, especially the unfinished tasks, you are in danger of destroying the whole motive power of SuperFocus. <br><br>Admittedly on a few occasions I have decided that an urgent task isn't quite as urgent as I first thought, and I have decided it would be more appropriate on a later page. But even that I would keep to the absolute minimum.<br><br>The only exception I would permit for unfinished tasks is if it's not physically possible to do something, e.g. because it's out of office hours. In that case you can cross it out and move it to the next page.</div>

<div class="content">Great, thanks Mark!   That is a good clarification (and it's what I expected you would say!).</div>

<div class="content">It also seems that we sometimes forget that "MUST be actioned" does not mean; must be completed. It means do something to move it forward; so that you can move forward.</div>

<div class="content">Sorry, but I think one question is not answered yet: <br>"Or does it mean "MUST be actioned", as in you either DO it or DELETE it?" <br><br>For me this would make sense: I've started something, but have not finished it and I have to dismiss it if I'm not progressing... <br><br>Mark, what is your intention?</div>

<div class="content">Christian:<br><br><< Mark, what is your intention? >><br><br>I thought I'd answered that in my reply to Seraphim above.</div>

<div class="content">Sorry Mark,<br>but I wouldn't have asked that question if it was clear to me... (I must admit that I'm a bloody Kraut and Englisch is not my mother tongue....)<br>So I dare to ask again:<br>In case the column 2 item is not actioned I'm not only a spineless wimp but<br>a) the item is dismissed (and will be reviewed lateron)<br>b) the item is deleted/killed/dead (and will be ignored for the future)<br>For me Seraphim distiguished between dismissal and deletion as I do now in my question...</div>

<div class="content">Christian:<br><br>What I meant was that all tasks in Column 2 must be ACTIONED - not dismissed or deleted.<br><br>There are two exceptions:<br><br>1) When it's not physically possible to do a task (e.g. because of the wrong location or time of day). In that case you can cross the task out and re-enter it on the following page in Column 2. (Note that this exception does not apply to Column 1 tasks).<br><br>2) When you decide a urgent task is not as urgent as you first thought. In which case you can cross it out and enter it at the end of the list in Column 1.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, that was the clarification I needed. To summarize: Once I have started a task but not finished it (I know, it's important to define "finished" for each task, ideally reflected in the wording of the task) I can't dismiss or delete it anymore...<br>But what shall I do if I decide that this task, which resides in column 2, is not worth to be finished (for whatever reason)? Or is this counted as "finished"?<br>In practice this has not happened to me yet (using SF3 for a week now), but I want to have the liberty to decide that a specific task is "killed", regardless where it stands now.</div>

<div class="content">Christian G:<br><br>If you decide that you are not going to do or continue with a task at all, you can delete it from the list at any time.</div>
