<div class="content">Is this a common practice? It's a new concept to me. <br><br>When a big item comes up:<br>It's the kind that benefits from concerted effort more than random snippets<br>It requires significant energy levels. <br>E.g. Preparing a fancy meal<br>I pick it off the focus list and put it into an open time on the calendar. As it approaches, I  mentally prepare myself for that action and that time. <br><br>Above is my propostal, not yet my practice.</div>

<div class="content">I've used the technique of scheduling blocks of work into my calendar on and off for years - with varying degrees of success.  Sometimes you need to make a commitment to yourself to do something as a coherent thing, which scheduling achieves.  It also has the advantage (for me at least) of making my unavailability during that period visible to other people - and also prevents others booking blocks of time which overlaps, which given what I do is a major hazard to actually getting work done.  Far too easy to sleepwalk into a week of meetings leaving no time for actual work!<br><br>I find this approach particularly useful when workloads get really heavy, and especially when dealing with tasks which require focused concentration.  An example - I need to review many, many documents and booking a block of time for each large document or group of small documents allows me to also see when I might be able to actually finish the job.  Otherwise interruptions tend to interrupt, and deadlines slip.  For the kind of documents I'm reviewing (requirements, technical specifications, test plans) I need to focus and build a mental model of what the document describes so I can find holes in it, which means interruptions are particularly destructive.<br><br>Of course it's not completely foolproof - sometimes finding the necessary focus at the appointed time can be difficult, or life intervenes. But it's another widget in the toolbox.</div>
