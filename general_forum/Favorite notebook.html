<div class="content">You're not sad.  I think most people who are into productivity also have a thing for office supplies.  <br><br>While I love Moleskine notebooks, I find they're 'too nice' to use.  The best notebooks for me are the cheapest ones that I can keep in my back pocket and not worry about trashing.</div>

<div class="content">Moleskine. They are too nice not to use. I use the "medium" sized gridded notebook. The paper quality makes writing in it pleasurable. The cahiers are OK for misc. stuff I like to keep track of, but for AF I like to have a little real estate, so I can see more tasks on a page. And the stiffer covers make it easier for me to write on the go.<br><br>I would love to keep an 8" x 11" or an A4 (I believe across the pond), but it would then be too large.<br><br><br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">I also like Moleskines, but the standad ones are too thick for my taste. I don't like the cahiers, but the volants work really nice for me.</div>

<div class="content">Atoma A4 squared.  Here in Belgium Atoma and Adoc (no Circa) are on the same shelves,  but Atoma had the lightest squares. I am thinking about a bound B5 format.</div>

<div class="content">Will,<br><br>Mind sharing your thoughts on the reporter style/size books?  I took a look at them and they seemed a tad too large to carry "on me" and a tad too small to be otherwise useful.  I found that the absolutely smallest one that makes sense to me (if I don't carry it on me) is a "steno pad" ... which is about 6"x9", if memory serves.  8.5"x11" is about ideal for desk work, but a good happy medium is the composition book, cited above.  (Damn but the price on those has gone up!  I used to be able to get real "lab books" but I would not spend the money for them now.  They are nice because they have pre-numbered pages.)  I like the composition books because they are sewn and don't have rings to catch on things, but the ringed 8x11 books are cheapest ... under $1 on sale at back to school times.</div>

<div class="content">I use the pocket ruled moleskine, and use both pages (~44 lines, usually a few less since I date every page) as one. Front for home, back for work.</div>

<div class="content">I would also like to know what 'the point of the reporter format' is, in relation to AF.  I used to run my whole life with the lists I made in reporter's notebooks, but stopped using them when I began reading about 'proper' time-management.  I assumed they were a part of my old ignorant way of doing things that had to go.  I still feel nostalgic when I see them in shops -  now that really is sad!</div>

<div class="content">In my case, it makes a difference what I am writing on in any "system" as to whether I will use it or not... have to have a good pen, a good paper, etc.  My current choice is a circa notebook in letter size because I can tear out my finished pages and move them to the back. It fulfills my need to be able to "start fresh" if I don't like something - even though I have not had to do this, it makes me feel better :)  I also would be able to use the smaller junior size, although neither is small enough to carry in a pocket.  These products are the ones with the "rolodex" type slots that allow removing and reinserting into the notebook.</div>

<div class="content">Right now I'm using an old Cambridge City book I had that I wasn't using.  It has only 32 blank pages left in it, so I'm hoping I'll be able to use my new one in a couple of months.  I like the coils on the one I'm using, but I wanted something beautiful for my next book for home, so I bought one of these:<br><br><a href="http://paperblanks.com/old_leather/oldleatherwraps.htm" rel="nofollow">http://paperblanks.com/old_leather/oldleatherwraps.htm</a><br><br>25 lines/pp, magnetic flip over cover, 144 pages, a perfect size for a year's worth of tasks.  It has a little pouch at the back like Moleskines.  <br><br>Maybe not the most practical or functional book, but it sure is pretty.  :-)<br></div>

<div class="content">I'm a moleskine girl, too - one for AF, one for my personal journal/scrapbook/everything.<br><br>Right now for AF I'm using a Piccadilly* (knock-off Moleskine) pocket notebook, medium-sized.  Compared to a Moleskine, everything is cheaper - the paper is thinner, the ribbon fell out in about 2 weeks, and it's separating from the spine on one side.  My next notebook will be the 'real thing' but I will also probably switch to a small size so that it's easier to tote around - two medium-sized books take up too much space in my purse!<br><br>*<a href="http://www.piccadillyinc.com/products_notebooks.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.piccadillyinc.com/products_notebooks.php</a></div>

<div class="content">I love Miquelruis spiral-bound notebooks. I'm currently using a four-section notebook with 26 lines per page for AF. It's 6.5' x 8" (A5?), 140 pages.

<div class="content">I am using a moleskine, but one of the paper covered ones, that comes in packs of threes.  It has a handy pocket which I can use to tuck small action related stuff like receipts for things to take back to the shop etc.<br><br>I have a notebook fetish and have about 4 nice notebooks of various brands waiting for me to start with next.  I have found that my AF notebook gets quite beaten up over time, so I want it to start out nice.  I also didn't realise (this is my first notebook) how often I would be carrying it around and in front of whom.  A professional looking book in important to me now.</div>

<div class="content">Those "soft" covered Moleskines are called cahiers. IME, they dont hold up well. I do use them for other writing, but nothing I am doing that requires taking them out more than a few times an hour throughout my day.<br><br>The Miquel Ruis notebooks are wonderful, but do not lend themselved for carrying around and heavy duty use. They are also perforated which means I invariably lose pages.<br><br>The original Moleskines stand up to serious use. I work in a lab and it takes a beating. The only damage to the notebooks that always happens is that I lose the ribbon within 96 hours of beginning to use one.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Sorry, Mike: Just had a solid eight days of non-discretionary time and I've been staying away from the forum (I do find it a bit of a time sink...)<br><br>I don't use reporters style notebooks myself, and bought a block of three ordinary pocket moleskines which I'm still working through. The major plus point for a reporters format is that you can support the whole writing area with your non-writing hand. you also get a single long list when you look at two pages together.<br><br>Moleskine (and many others) do pocket sized reporters style notebooks. (same size as the standard, 3 1/2" x 5 1/2") <a href="http://www.moleskineuk.com/acatalog/Moleskine_Pocket_Ruled_Reporter_Notebook.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.moleskineuk.com/acatalog/Moleskine_Pocket_Ruled_Reporter_Notebook.html</a><br><br>It was only as I typed this that I realised that you could get a two page spread - as I don't yet have either a reporters notebook or a good spacial imagination, these things take a little time for me. So thanks for triggering me to think this through. <br><br>My next notebooks will</div>

<div class="content">Hi Will,<br><br>Thanks for your reply.<br><br>My problem with the reporter's style is that I can't write on the back side of the pages, unless I go to the end, flip it over, and then work back to the beginning ... but that involves more logistics and flip-flopping around than seems to make sense.  Also, I use the back of the book (working forward) for special lists so that would get in the way.  With the wire bound vertical format books I can fold them double and work on either the front of a page or the back ... and so I can work in one direction and not have to flip unless I need to access my special lists.<br><br>As to looking at the whole thing as a single long page ... I have two problems with that:<br><br>1) As I said before, I can't quite see how to write on the "top" part.  It kind of hangs out there in space.  How would I support it?  Hold the top and let the bottom "dangle"?<br><br>2) Visually, I don't like the two page spread.  I tried it with my wire bound book (to expand the 15 lines per page to 30 for the new "double virtual page", as it were.  It did not work for me.  Something about the physical page overrode the "virtual page".  Even though I told myself it was one long page my mind insisted on seeing it as two pages.<br><br>It is too bad, really.  I wish the reporter style would fold back over on itself.  That would be ideal for me.  I don't much like the wire spiral .. it catches on things.  But then again, it is a handy place to store my pen.  ;-)<br><br>Thanks again for taking the time to reply.</div>

<div class="content">My all-time favorite is the $2.79 Quad Ruled Composition book from Staples:  <a href="http://www.staples.com/office/supplies/p1_Staples-Composition-Notebooks_19440_Business_Supplies_10051_SEARCH" rel="nofollow">http://www.staples.com/office/supplies/p1_Staples-Composition-Notebooks_19440_Business_Supplies_10051_SEARCH</a><br><br>A close second is the $3.49 National College-Ruled Composition book.  <a href="http://www.staples.com/office/supplies/p1_National-Brand-Composition-Notebook-Black_130135_Business_Supplies_10051_SEARCH" rel="nofollow">http://www.staples.com/office/supplies/p1_National-Brand-Composition-Notebook-Black_130135_Business_Supplies_10051_SEARCH</a><br><br>They have $1 composition books at Walmart but they are all wide-ruled.  I use those for my boys' AF book (chores, homework, fun stuff).  I prefer college or quad-ruled, since you get more items per page.  Quad-ruled is nice for work, too, since it helps draw diagrams.</div>

<div class="content">For out and about note taking my favorite has to be the classic Silvine red memo book, the 042.<br><br><a href="http://www.silvine.com/products.php?RANGE/HERITAGE" rel="nofollow">http://www.silvine.com/products.php?RANGE/HERITAGE</a><br><br>Small and bendy enough for your back pocket @ around 6x4", quality everyday paper and on the money @ 59p it also has a cool retro look to it!<br><br>For best though... I have a plain artists pocket moleskine.   I use it with the spine to the top and write/scribble all over the double page.  I think I like the feel of the paper, the stiffness of the covers and the flexibility the plain paper gives me... although I hate the cheap looking black shiny covers!<br><br>Simon</div>

<div class="content">As life is too simple without hacks:<br><br>One possibility is to cut down a margin free A4 notebook from a width of 21 to 14 cm as mostly the whole page width is not used.  All this to reduce the desktop real estate of a notebook. And also to avoid folding the notebook,  what makes moving around the list more difficult.<br><br>Any A4 without margins will do, nevertheless a link to the victim of the intervention: <a href="http://www.lincolnstationers.com/wirebound-notebookgraph-p-11399.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lincolnstationers.com/wirebound-notebookgraph-p-11399.html</a></div>

I mean, I already have a collection of unused Moleskins, EcoQuas and various other spiral and stitched notebooks.
