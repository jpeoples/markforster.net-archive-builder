<div class="content">Mark says in the A4 instructions: "It’s perfectly acceptable to use sheets of ruled paper rather than a notebook. You need two lists, a Backlog and an Active List." I much prefer a binder, and so I have modified the instructions as follows. However, I am just starting on this. Anyone more experienced see gaping issues with this approach?<br><br>1)	Draw up your list of things to do with one task per line. You don’t need to put everything on the list at this stage, you can add other tasks as and when you think of them. Keeping adding to this list until you have filled both sides of a sheet.<br><br>2)	When full, this sheet becomes your Backlog; everything on the sheet is part of your backlog. As you think of new tasks add them to a second sheet. Everything on the second sheet is known as your Active List.<br><br>3)	Cycle repeatedly through your Backlog, working on any tasks which you feel need to be done. Delete each task when you feel you have worked on it long enough; re-enter it on the Active List if you need to do more work on it at a later time.<br><br>4)	When you have done a complete pass through your Backlog without any of the tasks needing work, begin working on your Active List. Work through the Active List in order from the beginning, tackling any tasks which need to be done. When you reach the last task on that list, return to your Backlog List and repeat Step 3.<br><br>5)	When you reach the end of your currently Active Sheet, add it to your Backlog and begin a new Active Sheet.<br><br>6)	When you have been working on your Backlog for some time, one sheet may be down to just a few tasks which for some reason or other you are reluctant to tackle. At this stage you may end up going over these repeatedly without tackling any of the tasks. At this point, delete all the remaining tasks on this sheet, but mark them for review. <br><br>The next time you come to the beginning of your Backlog, you should review each "marked" item, deciding what to do with each one in turn. You may elect to abandon it, re-enter it on the Active List (with or without re-phrasing), or put it into a reminder system for review at a later date. In making the decision what to do with each task, you should look at the reasons why you haven’t done it yet.<br><br>-Thanks all, <br>Gordon</div>

<div class="content">Hi Gordon<br><br>Looks good. Many of us are using the terms Open and Closed in place of Active and Backlog, I'm not sure when that change came in.</div>

<div class="content">"Many of us are using the terms Open and Closed in place of Active and Backlog, I'm not sure when that change came in."<br><br>That happened on the same day Mark demonstrated AF4. Initially, he hesitated to call the closed list a backlog because it isn't what you normally mean when you say backlog. When he settled on backlog and active list, some people where confused, not only by the backlog issue, but also because many associated 'active list' with 'list that sees most activity', which isn't true for the active list, but for the backlog. So many decided to stick with open and closed list, which where already established terms in Autofocus 'lore' and simply decribe the two lists distinguishing properties.</div>

<div class="content">@Gordon:<br>Interesting approach. But without trying I see one shortcoming:<br>The closed list isn't a closed list anymore  - because, every time you reach the end of the active page you are extending your closed list by adding the former active page to the closed list.<br>Could be, that this will undermine the idea of the closed list.</div>

<div class="content">Yes, this system behaves very different from AF4. I think what Mark originally meant was to just use the original rules with loose leaves instead of a notebook. I don't think he intended for the two lists to be physically separate. But this approach is interesting. Perhaps if you modified the rules so that the active list can have more than one sheet and all active page sheets are moved to the closed list at once when the closed list is dismissed, it would be more true to AF4.</div>

<div class="content">I would guess that as the "closed list" gets longer, the "open list" will never be worked on until it is added to the "closed list".  So it seems to devolve to a single list (a bit like AF1) with items being added a page at a time (i.e. only when they fill up a page).<br><br>That is not to say that this way of doing things is bad ... just that is is not really AF4 or anything close to it, IMO.</div>

<div class="content">My interpretation of<br>"It’s perfectly acceptable to use sheets of ruled paper rather than a notebook. You need two lists, a Backlog and an Active List." <br>is:<br><br>When you start with AF4 and use loose-leaf sheets of ruled paper instead of a bound notebook then you will have three types of pages on your sheets:<br><br>1) Pages that have only items of your closed/backlog list.<br>2) Pages that have only items of your open/active list.<br>3) One page that has items of your closed/backlog list on its upper part (the last items of your closed/backlog list) and items of your open/active list on its lower part ( the fist items of your open/active list). Between these two parts is a horizontal line.<br><br>So there is no difference in the shape of your lists. The only difference in your "system" is that the sheets are loose-leaf, and not bound (e.g. hardback).</div>

<div class="content">I'm not sure it's clearly stated here, so I'll try:<br><br>In practice there is one list, divided by a Line separating Open and Closed.  The closed list can't have anything added to it (there's no room to add anyway).  The open list grows on the end, until the Closed list is finished (empty), the Open List becomes Closed (line drawn), and a new Open list is just the stuff after the line.<br><br>The system would still function identically if instead of drawing a line, you added a new page and put a divider separating those pages.  (If your open list always fits within one page, you don't even need the divider.)</div>

<div class="content">Thanks everyone for your replies. I think the key is that the Open List can stay open until the Closed List is complete. My idea creates a closed list with each completed sheet. I am not sure my approach causes a problem, but you have helped me work through the key difference. Thanks. -Gordo</div>
