<div class="content">As promised (grin): "I have a handful of tasks. I also have several projects open, each of which has many tasks. What are some recommendations on dealing with related groups of tasks (like projects) without losing sight of tasks that aren't related to that group/project?"<br><br>I've already done some more thorough searching on this site and have started to answer my own question. The most common recurring theme seems to be to have separate lists for each project and to have "review project x" as an item on your main AF list. I'm going to start with this approach myself and see how well it works for me.<br><br>Another excellent resource that will help me specifically is <a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2007/3/1/how-to-get-any-project-up-and-running.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2007/3/1/how-to-get-any-project-up-and-running.html</a> . I have three more days this week to try it out.<br><br>Oddly, I'm actually *excited* about the prospect of working on my tasks now. I think GTD helped me identify *what* I needed to get done and AF is helping me *manage* the actual doing.</div>

<div class="content">Another good idea is this one:<br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2009/9/1/keeping-ones-markers-aligned.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2009/9/1/keeping-ones-markers-aligned.html</a><br><br>Keep your project materials as you said, but put Next Action ---> Project X into AF.  When you finish Next Action, find another action for that project and put that into AF as a new entry.</div>

<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>Alan's "Micro Goals" idea paired up with the "3-Tasks Method" is another good way of doing projects...or at least GENERATING projects ^___^  I am using it right now, and it works great!<br><br>Here's how I do it:<br><br>1) Pick a project.  A project, in my case, is any task that cannot be done within 15-20 minutes<br>2) Break the project down into broad tasks.  <br>3) Determine if the first/next task can be done in approximately less than 30 minutes.  If yes, go to step 5.  If no, go to step 4.<br>4) Break down next task to smaller tasks.  Go back to step 3.<br>5) Write down the task in a piece of paper or back of your notebook.<br>6) If you have less than three tasks written on your paper, go back to step 3. If you have three tasks written already, go to next step.<br>7) Work on the three steps in any order.  Cross out any that is finished.<br>8) If an urgent task comes to you, you MAY or MAY NOT write the task on your piece of paper before working on it.  If you want to write it down, place a symbol before the task item (I use a plus (+) sign).  Upon finishing the urgent task you cross it out; if you want to go back to your project before finishing your urgent task, cross it out and write it in your reminders list. YOU MUST CROSS OUT THE URGENT TASK BEFORE YOU CAN GO BACK TO YOUR PROJECT (this will minimize distractions).<br>9) If you finish your project or have done what you can do for now, go back to step 1; otherwise go to step 10.<br>10) Once you have AT MOST ONE TASK left in your paper, go back to step 3.  <br><br>God bless!</div>
