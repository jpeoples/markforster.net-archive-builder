<div class="content">I am back a 100% with SF. For the moment everything is all right. I have a good control of my task, dismissing is Ok too and the rules are ok with me. Except the activity. I am working very hard because I have to obtain quick results very fast. The consequence is a huge increasement of tasks and a need to do my last tasks first (urgencies). So as I could not pass the pages fast enough I exceptionally decided to go backward and beginning by my last page as in AF2. Ie page 3 C2 the Page 3 C1, then page 2 C2, then page 2 C1 then page 1 C2 (none) then page one C1. And then again as usual Page 1 C1 then C2, page 2 C1 then C2, page 3 C1 then C3, page 4.... <br><br>I felt a better control and things advanced faster. I wish to know if some of you has tried this and what were the results. Could you tell me ? <br><br>I also noticed a reel effect on my productivity changing my A4 spiral notebook for a smaller A5 ruled notebook like the student has. I rather prefer it, it is smaller on my desk and I feel much better with my work. Isn't strange ?</div>

<div class="content">Jupiter,<br><br>This is an interesting idea.  As you describe it, you alternate directions by make one pass through the pages backward, then a pass through them forward.  When you are moving backward, and working e.g. on a task from C1 on p.2, where do you rewrite it if it isn't finished?<br><br>Your explanation about why you alternate directions doesn't make sense to me, however.  If you have urgent tasks to do, you never need to wait until you get to the page where these were originally listed. Just enter them again on C2 of the current page, and cross them out on the pages where they were listed originally.</div>
