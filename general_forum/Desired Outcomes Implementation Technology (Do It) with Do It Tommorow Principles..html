<div class="content">Hi everyone, <br> <br>Having come to the conclusion that Gerry's Do It works absolutely fine for me and seems to do exactly what it's supposed to do, I am currently using Do It along with principles from Mark Forster's ideas in 'Do it tommorow'. <br> <br>I feel this works well for me as it places the emphasis on following my Desired Outcomes whilst giving sufficient attention to those things that must be done on a daily basis. <br> <br>The aim for me is to take on less extra work as possible, whilst still working efficiently, and to avoid overwhelmingly long lists. I want to 'chunk' incoming work into 3 distinct categories and not feel overwhelmed. I do feel systems like GTD seem to be very receptive to accepting lots of tasks and requests from others. I write up the following each day on a spiral bound A4 (letter sized) note book:<br> <br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>Date <br> <br>1. Desired Outcome action (copied from Do It notebook)<br>2. Desired Outcome action<br>3. Desired Outcome action<br>_______________________________________________________________________________<br>         Email                            Voicemail               Tray (paper tasks)<br>______________________________________________________________________________<br> <br> <br>(The rest of the page is for daily notes, e.g. voicemail messages and reference info)<br> <br> <br> <br>_______________________________________________________________________________<br> <br>The aim is to bring upto date all incoming work from yesterday. The aim is to get the < & > symbols marked down as soon as possible to free up the time for working on Desired Outcomes. Bracketing the inbox in this way seems to get it cornered and contained for the day!The idea is do work each 'box' in a batch. As with Mark Forster, urgent items can be done on the same day. <br> <br>Key: < > = Work & Home updated for today. - = Unavailable to do today. l = Not successfully brought upto date today. <br><br>For example: <br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><Email>                    <Voicemail>            I Tray (Paper Work) ><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br> <br>The example above shows that I brought my incoming emails  and voicemails upto date at work and at home. It also shows that whist I brought my paperwork at home upto date, I did not at work. I feel this provides useful feedback on how one deals with incoming work, or in other words 'other peoples' priorities'. The idea would therefore to get upto date with the incoming paperwork before starting on new tasks. I feel this is not always as hard as it seems because a lot of pressure in life, in my case at least, can be self imposed. Individual items that cannot be actioned today can be entered onto a calender to deal with on another day.<br> <br>For those unfamiliar with 'Do It Tommorow' its great feature is being able to update incoming work quickly and avoid fire fighting. <br> <br>Please let me know if you have any questions or have feedback.<br> <br>Thanks,<br> <br>Leon</div>

<div class="content">Leon,<br><br>Thanks for the feedback.  Personally, I just time block, so when I am using DOIT, I am in that notebook, and when doing time management, I am using what ever I am experimenting with on the TM side, which could be a AF, or one of my systems.  I can see how putting the DO IT action into your TM system is helpful and keeps it in front of you to make sure it gets done.  <br><br>Gerry<br>http::// www.simple-time-management.com</div>
