<div class="content">.....you have a routine task that is on the page you are looking at but doesn't need doing right at that moment?  Do you leave it on that page or cross it out and add it to your final page?<br><br>I've been leaving them on the page but wondered if it was better to cross it out and add it to the end.<br><br>I'd be interested to know what everyone else is doing.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Caroline<br><br>You only do the tasks that stand out, i.e. that you "feel" like doing on that page.  If you don't feel like doing it then you just leave it on the page.  When you come back to that page it may (or may not!) stand out on that pass.  Either is ok.  It is only if you get to a point where that is the only task on that page that you have to make a decision - do it or dismiss it.<br><br>You would only cross it out and add it to the last page if you had actioned it and it needed repeating.<br><br>Hope that helps .......</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Christine<br><br>Yes, that was what I thought originally.  Having just thought about it, if I added the task to the end of the list I would come up against it sooner anyway.  I'd also constantly be rewriting it!<br><br>Caroline</div>
