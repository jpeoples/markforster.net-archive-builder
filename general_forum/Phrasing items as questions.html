<div class="content">There was a post that suggested phrasing items as a question - "make call re item xyz?" <br><br>As I understood it (and I can't find the post again to make sure) - <br>If the answer's yes cross the item off, it's done, and add any necesary follow-up tasks. <br>If the answer is no, cross the item off because you answered the question (even though it doesn't get you any closer to a finished phone call) and re-add it to the end of the list. <br>I have several items that I'm dreading (not surprisingly they're all the same type of to-do) but they need to be done, so dismissing them is not the 'right' option. But if I rephrase the item as a question, I'm thinking there'll become  permanent fixtures on the list as they get crossed off and re-added since the answer is 'no' <br><br>I'm assuming that sooner or later (probably later) these items-as-question items eventually do get done, dismissed, or delegated. Don't they?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Lillian<br><br>You'd be more likely to use questions for items where you are waiting for a response.  So for example if you called re item xyz and the person wasn't there and you had to leave a message you would put a follow up as "Fred called back?"  When the item stood out it you would either schedule or make another call or reenter it.</div>

<div class="content">Lillian:<br><br>Yes, when waiting for a response as Christine says or where there's any condition which needs to be fulfilled before you can action the task.<br><br>For tasks that you are dreading, the recommended procedure is to follow the instructions re dismissal, which is then a chance to review the task and see if you can break it down or re-phrase it in such as way that you can do it.</div>

<div class="content">If you are uncertain about something, so have a question about it, you could list it as 'Think about xyz'; 'Find out about...' 'Decide...' etc.<br>I am finding it really helpful to use verbs at the beginning instead of just listing the thing/noun. It encourages me into action. It aslo helps to clarify if that is indeed my next step, for example, 'Holidays' might become - research hol venues; check hol budget; talk about hols with A; decide hols; book hols.............<br>..............now there's an idea!  I'll just go and put it on my Autofocus list.</div>

<div class="content">I don't phrase tasks as a question unless they are waiting for tasks like "Has X called back with Y information?"<br><br>As to dreaded tasks, I am easy on myself with respect to complete before ticking the task off.  One of the best ways I have found to get something moving is to focus on the smallest next action possible.  <br><br>For example:<br>Think about XYZ<br><br>Might become:<br>Find XYZ project information folder and put it on desk<br><br>OR<br><br>List two people who might have ideas about XYZ<br><br><br>For very difficult tasks, even thinking about it enough to figure out that amount of granular meaning moves it forward.  So rephrasing it into very small action is enough to let me rewrite it.  When I get to that rewritten task, I will usually have less resistence, as it is more bite-sized.</div>
