<div class="content">Seraphim asked an extended question in response to Erik's statement, "I eat the things I dont like first. ". <br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2010/9/30/using-resistance-as-a-guide.html#comment10052778" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2010/9/30/using-resistance-as-a-guide.html#comment10052778</a><br>Please read it. <br>I think this deserves a thread. One idea ( but I hope to see more ) is to set rewards. I can go to the movie only after I do 30 minutes of clean up. I may not do any more bookwork until I spend time doing other things. Another idea is Erik's time-limited system where each kind of activity gets a designated amount of time.</div>

<div class="content">Okay Erik, do you aim to do your "broccoli" work first?</div>

<div class="content">Well, it's become a habit so I don't consciously "aim" at it.<br>But you are right in thinking that I tend to tackle it first.<br><br>Maybe I shouldn't write this but when I was younger, I didn't brush my teeth very often... That gave me cavities but it also trained me in the fact that the last thing you eat is what your mouth will taste till the next meal... So, naturally, I ate what I preferred last.<br><br>Then, maturing a little bit, I (started brushing my teeth LOL) noticed that the things you resist, you'll find ingenious ways to do them fast and effectively, otherwise you'll have to do them again if it's botched. And doing them now clears your mind for what you really want to enjoy doing. Think about it: would you rather do the thing you like first all the while spoiling it with the "I have to do this after..." kind of thought or would you prefer to do what you hate thinking "I'm so gonna enjoy that after this job...". The gap between the too will be just that more pleasant.<br><br>The synergy you get from one and the other is akin to the ying yang way of seeing things. I totally understand that you can feel lazy and stuff but believe me, if you where as lazy as me, you'd eat your broccoli first!!! Having tasted that, I can just say that it works... for me at least. <br><br>I don't treat it as a reward though. It's just as I've stated it above: I don't want to spoil my good times thinking of the less then fun stuff.</div>

<div class="content">That doesn't always work for me. I just spent most of a day doing nothing. I really didn't want to do the three things I should have done, but felt guilty doing the less important things, so did nothing. Sometimes on days like that productive procrastination kicks in, but not always.</div>

<div class="content"><< I just spent most of a day doing nothing.

Fortunately, going through my DWM list I usually would find something I want to do (stands out), and important enough that I don't feel too guility of doing instead of the important ones I don't. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">When I'm up to date, my version of DWM keeps me going. Finishing a day's list is doable and gets done. It's when I'm too far behind that "why bother, I'll never catch up" sets in. Eventually, though, enough repeated tasks get skipped and I reach a page where I hadn't planned too much, and things get back on track.</div>
