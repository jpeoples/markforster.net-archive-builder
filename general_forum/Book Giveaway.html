<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2015-09-17 12:44</div>
<div class="content">Hello everyone,<br><br>I originally posted this a while ago in a thread concerning my web app in the FVP forum, but the chances of it being noticed there were obviously too slim. So I'm moving it here to the general forum:<br><br>I recently re-bought all of Mark's books for Kindle and don't need my paper editions anymore. If someone here wants "Get Everything Done", "How to Make Your Dreams Come True", and "Do It Tomorrow", post here and I'll send them to you as a gift. Conditions: You should live in the EU/UK and take all three of them (I don't want to ship them separately). First come, first serve. <br><br>Regards,<br>Andreas</div>

<div class="content">Hi Adam,<br><br>the offer still stands. If you send me your address to bookgiveaway@andreasmaurer.net, I'll try to get it to the postal office by the weekend.<br><br>If you'd like, I can also include the book "Journal to the Self: Twenty-Two Paths to Personal Growth" by Kathleen Adams, which is my last paper book.<br><br>Regards,<br>Andreas</div>
