<div class="content">I can't seem to find a copy of this book anywhere for a reasonable price and I would like to read it. Not even my local library has a copy!  Does anyone know if it is being reprinted?  I have Mark's other two books on order so I am looking forward to reading those too.</div>

<div class="content">I also want to read this book, having bought and read Mark's other books, and being a long-timer reader of this site and forum. But it seems to be out of print, and all the copies being offered are asking for huge prices, often over $100.  I wish Mark could tell the publisher to either re-issue the book or give him the rights, so that he can make it available again. Moreover, no library in the US has this book, so there is no other way for me to read it than to buy it.</div>
