<div class="content">As the title describes, I'm wondering what system people have managed to stick with for the longest period of time. Which system, and for how long?<br><br>I guess I'm interested in seeing which systems are the most "sustainable" over the long-term, recognizing that different situations can call for different systems.</div>

<div class="content">For me, I think probably Bullet Journaling and GTD. It's been so long, I don't know which ones I used longer or more successfully (not necessarily the same thing). <br><br>For a very long time I worked off of a calendar and my own todo lists ranked by priority/importance a la Randy Pausch? I'm not sure it was a system though, as I was constantly adjusting things, so I think it was really a progressive set of systems that were all oriented around the same basic principle. <br><br>I don't know if I've been able to stick to a single system for an entire year at a time, and I'm not sure I want to go through the archives to find out. I have managed to use a few systems for months at a time. That would include Brendon Burchard's approach to time blocking and journaling in his HPX Planner. <br><br>In fact, together with GTD and BuJo, Burchard's HPX planner system might be one of the ones I've used the longest at a stretch. I have to admit, though, that I'm not sure the time blocking was effective for me.</div>

<div class="content">In a pure vanilla sense?  I only make it a couple of days before I start mix and matching with other systems.  In a general framework sense I've been making a long list of items and using various algorithms to pick the next thing to do for years now. I suspect in the end it most resembles Simple Scanning the most.<br><br>The most important thing for me is to get it on the list and out of the head.</div>

<div class="content">Since 2019, I have been more/less using the same system. Goes something like this: <br><br>Hard landscape (Client appts): Calendar (Mac)<br>Time specific tasks: Reminders (iPhone/Apple Watch)<br><br>iPad mini/Apple Pencil: <br><br>1. Scatter Map (M. Forster idea) evening and morning<br>2. Throughout the day, quickly capture (1-2 words) what I've done, or about to do <br>3. Evening - transcribe #1 & #2 into text, paste into my journal (Pages document)<br>4. Craft a daily narrative based on the raw text. <br>5. Weekly Review/Narrative: Read over daily entries (add footnotes to sentences that require an update, a new thought, etc). Update project list with things to consider for next week <br><br>On Dec 31, I convert the Pages document into a PDF and have it printed at LuLu. <br><br>I don't use any lists re: Someday/Maybe, Master List, etc.</div>

<div class="content">Either the no list system 5/2 from the "Secrets" book in a nice paper notebook or a digital implementation of DWM in OmniOutliner. <br><br>(I did some scripting which did two things. It deleted the tasks ready for dismissal automatically and it colored tasks that approached that deadline. I can't remember how exactly that worked, it's years past.)<br><br>Other than that everything based on the FVP algorithm seems to stick around.</div>

<div class="content">Simple Scanning still holds the record for me. I believe I went over a year straight at one point.<br><br>I think the relative lack of rules/constraints was one reason why I was able to continue with it.</div>

<div class="content">My own system (which I call the 1-2-3-4 System) I've stuck with for almost a year now. Before that my record was maybe a month with FVP.</div>

<div class="content">Lisa, could you elaborate on your 1-2-3-4 system?</div>
