<div class="content">Just thinking out loud here.... I have a task to 'dryclean my winter coat' which can be done no sooner than mid-April-ish (weather permitting LOL). I have 2 choices ....<br><br>- Put it on a separate 'do in April' ticker list and move it to DWM when I review the tickler list in early April and the first time it's added to DWM it goes on the April 30 page (new task, today+28).<br><br>or<br><br>- Put it directly on the DWM April 30 page. <br><br>Since my current active list is February 23 - March 23,  having the item on Apr 30 is just as 'invisible' on a future DWM page vs a separate tickler list. In both cases, it comes into the active pages in early April (28 day month) (or very late March (30 day month) ). So on the face of it, there isn't a difference between the two except it's in on one list - which seems to be a plus for DWM.<br><br>I checked other threads and this idea came up briefly and Mark's concern about doing this was related to re-dating pages due to unexpected breaks.  Since the item, at least in this case, doesn't have an external due-date (it doesn't matter on which specific date I take the coat to the drycleaners - PICKING UP the coat afterwards, yes, but then it'll go on the calendar), re-dating pages won't negatively impact this kind of task. Tasks that do have external due-dates may not work as well having DWM as the tickler, I don't know. <br><br>To be fair, I haven't had any unexpected breaks that needed pages to be re-dated or items dismissed just because of a break, so I may be missing something because of no first-hand experience.  <br><br>So... DWM as tickler, yay or nay? (or more likely... try it and report back LOL)</div>

<div class="content">Lillian,<br><br>I'm struggling with the same type of thing. I use my 43-folders-style tickler files (one set at work and another at home) for many of my recurring tasks. I also log many of these tasks directly on the corresponding sheets. My routine is to dump anything from today's folder into my In tray, and then process the In tray to empty (as one of my main DWM recurring tasks). So the dilemma is: when I pick up a reminder/log sheet in my In tray, say, to clean the patio (which I'm very likely to put off till at least tomorrow), do I face reality and just re-file it directly in another day's folder, or do I add it to my DWM list at today+7, then put the log sheet in my Pending tray? Since now both tools are a form of structured procrastination, the choice is a bit confusing.<br><br>I think the main thing is not to have a reminder for the same task in two different places. It's also important that whatever reminder system you use is reliable, based on your working style.<br><br>Some might think that the DWM system obviates the need for recurring-task ticklers. But I actually like the feeling of just re-filing a sheet to tomorrow or next week or next month, rather than adding it directly to my list. Knowing that I'll get that reminder again in a few days feels better than adding it to my list today. Call me lazy...</div>

<div class="content">Lillian,<br><br>This is a great example. And it's something about which I have some very strong opinions. DWM is NOT a calendar (in Yankee-speak). DWM is a list of tasks that I could be working on RIGHT NOW! <br><br>Ideally, we will be cycling repeatedly through our list. We do this looking for things to do RIGHT NOW that stand out. Today is February 23. Why would I, today, repeatedly want to look at an item that I cannot begin to work on for two months?<br><br>Of course, I am not Mark. And others might have something to say, as well. But the fact that we use a calendar (or diary) form for making our DWM list is purely non-essential. My view is that everything in DWM list is currently doable. If I really cannot start work on something for another month, then I put it in my tickler or calendar, not in DWM.</div>

<div class="content">Lilian, moises, ubi:<br><br>This topic of due dates is circling  around the forum elsewhere.  I also call them 'can do' dates because they are impossible until the context is appropriate.<br><br>In AF, and DWM, I still use contexts because they determine when some things are possible.  I would write down a task, then realise that as I was abroad, clearing the loft was impossible.  So I gave these a tag  'Defer To Do Later' and await for the context to make them feasible.<br><br>Example: online banking, VAT returns depend on the quality of the Internet where one is based.  So I would put such tasks on refer to a date when I would next have adequate Internet access.  On one assignment, I was able to process these tasks at Johannesburg Airport while waiting for my flight back home.<br><br>So for me, like your coat example, some things just cannot be listed at + 28 or 30 from entry.  The use of eg Outlook reminders or 43 folders, ticklers files, whatever, are realistic.<br><br>But I do try to follow the DWM rules with the rest!</div>

<div class="content">I choose to write the task with the DWM system on a particular date.  Strong caveat though: I think Mark is right that if you miss days you need to push your tasks back (unless you are well ahead of the game).  If that means redating, then my approach will be an obstacle because you'd have to move your appointments.  I'm working electronically and moving stuff is easy for me.  <br><br>If I had a paper book I think I'd have separate pages dedicated to appointments.  Or I'd use the dated pages and bear the burden of rewriting appointments if it came to that.</div>

<div class="content">In my Outlook implementation of DWM, I'm doing exactly what Lillian describes.  <br><br>I don't want my DWM list to be cluttered with things that CAN'T be done yet.  I don't want any items to show up on the list until they CAN be done.  I filter the tasks in Outlook so I only see the coming month.<br><br>If an item CAN'T be started till April 15th, then I have been putting a due date of May 15th.  Then, it will show up on my Today+1M page for the first time on April 15th, at which time the Today+1M page will be May 15th.<br><br>This works pretty well so far.  <br><br>On paper, I did this using a Tickler.  On April 15th, I would check the tickler for anything in the April 15th folder, and then add those items to the end of the DWM list, ie., on the May 15th page.   But now, since it has worked so well in Outlook just to future-date the item, if I ever go back to paper I think I might be able to do away with the tickler altogether.<br><br>The re-dating thing isn't an issue for me, since I decided not to do that if I miss days, as described at <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1019780" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1019780</a> .</div>

<div class="content">Both Alan B and Seraphim have highlighted that electronic solutions do give the user more flexibility, not just to move things around willy-nilly, but to update DWM in line with the rules, give or take a tweak here and there ;-}<br><br>Seraphim: you make an enticing case for me to think about using Outlook again!  Can you contact me at rhj1947ATgmail.com and I'll send you my usual email address?</div>

<div class="content">I apply DWM strictly ie using entry at only 2 points.  It just encourages one to get on with things.  Deadlines can be monitored as you prefer:<br><br>- in a separate list of dates<br>- in a paper tickler say 43 folders<br>- in the paper or electronic calander<br>- in a site like memotome.com that sends you e-mail (I am not on commission!)<br>- in the task description in DWM (eg report for boss - due 5 May)<br><br>I wouldn't enter tasks in DWM on other than the 2 normal points.  I think it spoils the closed list effect.</div>

<div class="content">When I am in the flow, I might well put a task on the +month list to "Calendarise task X". And what I will put in the calendar, when I get a moment, is a reminder to put the task on the list when it can be done. Inefficient? Possibly, but it minimises distractions, which is the key thing.</div>

<div class="content">I am beginning to think using tags for contexts can be very powerful in DWM. I am using separate lists now but is is cumbersome and it results in me not looking at my DWM enough.<br>I was using 2 googe calendar, one for DWM and one for real appointments but since the softwares are less than perfect on android and even on the web for managing a DWM with google calendar I decided to switch to astrid on android (synchronized with RTM).<br>With astrid I can't order tasks with creation dates (this is amazing such a basic sort option is not available) but I intend to:<br><br>-order them by due date<br>-tag tasks that have a context so I could rapidly check all the tasks I have to do at work or anywhere else, while at the same time treating them as normal DWM tasks (until now I had contexts lists separated from DWM and is was a very bad Idea)<br>-create a calendar item from a task (there is such option in Astrid)<br>-Add one or several reminders, or make a task display from a certain date.<br><br>I don't think this is possible on paper that's why I think DWM could have definitive advantages to be done electronically (if only there was a good solution ^^; )</div>

<div class="content">Man of Kent - <br><<I wouldn't enter tasks in DWM on other than the 2 normal points. I think it spoils the closed list effect.>><br><br>Not sure about the other folks, but for me, entering items beyond the 30-day mark does NOT spoil the closed list effect, since I never look beyond the 30-day mark when I am processing my list, looking for things to do.  There are only two open lists that I actually see as I cycle through the list:  the 7-day page and the 30-day page.  <br><br>If I have a task that I can't start for 10 days, then I don't want it to even show up on my list for 10 days.  So I have a choice.  <br><br>(1) I can put it in a tickler of some kind (electronic of 43-folders style or whatever), and then when it shows up in the tickler, I can then copy it to the 30-day page in DWM.<br><br>(2) I can add it right now to the 40-day page in DWM.<br><br>Choice (1) is more complex.  (A) I must maintain a tickler.  (B) I must write the task twice, once on the tickler, and once again when I move it from the tickler to DWM.<br><br>However, this process does get quite complicated if you are re-dating your pages every time you return from being sick or having gone on vacation.  That's the only downside I can see.  But since I don't re-date pages it doesn't apply to me.<br><br><br>Also, this doesn't really have anything to do with deadlines.  It's more about "startlines" -- managing items that need to go into the tickler that you don't want to see until they are able to be started.</div>

And having a future-tickler list in one place and the DWM list someplace else (even if they are most likely going to be in the same notebook - it'sstill  two separate lists) may be more overhead than I want, if DWM can act as a future-tickler for items that aren't tied to a specific date.<br><br>Roger J--<br>>>This topic of due dates is circling around the forum elsewhere.

What I'm thinking is to put 'dryclean coat' on the May 3 page now, instead of putting on a separate tickler list and then putting it on May 3 as a new item when i review the tickler list on April 3.  I've tried contexts before and they over-complicate things for me. <br><br>Alan B - I'm not talking about appointments or anything else that needs to be done on a specific date. From what I've seen so far on my own list, I'm not planning to re-date pages for missed days. If it's a planned 'day off' those days will be cleared ahead of time. Unplanned missed days, I haven't totally decided, but probably a mix of  (1) staying offlist one more day and catching up or (2) just let things expire and re-add them as necessary or (3) something else TBD :) .<br><br>Seraphim - thank you, yes that's exactly what I'm thinking.

<div class="content">One of the beauties of using some electronic systems is that you can also set a "start date" for a task. In that way, the task is hidden until the start date arrives.<br><br>I'm using Omnifocus on the iPhone and Mac to accomplish this.<br><br>My calendar is for appointments only.</div>

<div class="content">It seems as if the whole renumbering/redating thing is causing a ton of problems for paper systems.  I use a Circa book so I just move the pages.  If I needed to move them forward, I'd just pull out the empty pages and the long distance pages would not be affected.<br><br>As for the general question that started this thread, if I'm going to use a calendar to hold my TO DOs, I'm going to use it for the appointments as well.  I think it makes perfect sense to put an April 15th due item ON April 15, if it is before March 16th.  There is no DMW rule about any date after one month from today and, as pointed out by the original poster, it pops onto the right page at the right time automagically.  The way I see it, the pages later than one month from today might as well be blank, or in another notebook.</div>

<div class="content">Mike<br>>>It seems as if the whole renumbering/redating thing is causing a ton of problems for paper systems. <br><br>well, there's no problem if there's no re-numbering or re-dating :) which is the way I'm leaning toward. After working DWM for so long (ok, since early Feb ;) ) I feel better about the list if I'm 2-3 days ahead. That gives me enough wiggle room if something unexpected comes up. <br><br>>>As for the general question that started this thread, if I'm going to use a calendar to hold my TO DOs, I'm going to use it for the appointments as well.<br><br>?? <br><br>The original question didn't mention appointments...<br><br>I'm keeping my calendar separate from my DWM list.

<div class="content">DWM dates, in the absence of renumbering, are LAST POSSIBLE START dates.  So put an appointment on its exact date, and it will work out.  <br><br>DWM dates also imply FIRST POSSIBLE START dates.  A task can only start when its date is one month (or less) in the future.  You can put "due items" on their due date, but that implies you won't start until a month before.  <br><br>So figure out the earliest date you COULD start, and write the task 1 month after that date.  Failing that, figure when you MUST start, and write the task on that date if it's more than a month out.</div>

<div class="content">Alan,<br><br>I'd probably start by simply sticking "think about X" in at +month and getting on with my day. That gives me 30days to work out when to trigger the reminder to put the task in DWM.</div>
