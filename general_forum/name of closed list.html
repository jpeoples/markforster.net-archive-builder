<div class="content">Looking at my "closed" and "open" lists today I realised that by calling a list closed on a regular basis may have a "drip drip" effect of negativity such as the "shop is closed",  or the "road is closed" or being presented with something regularly that one can't get into. This is an attempt to get my unconscious associations on my side!<br><br>I wondered if any one can think of another fitting title that can be used instead that keeps the meaning accurate?<br><br>Thank you</div>

<div class="content">Isn't the official name "backlog"? (And "active list" for the open list?) I've seen that someone posted a pdf calling the lists "closed" and "open", but I didn't think these were the names commonly used…</div>

<div class="content">Goldmund,<br><br>When Mark initially talked about AF4 he used the term "backlog".  That caused confusion because those things on that list are NOT backlogged.  He changed the names to "closed" and "open" because those more accurately describe what the lists are.<br><br>The "closed" list is called that because it is ... well ... CLOSED ;-)  Nothing can be added ... and that is the only attribute worth calling attention to.  The "open" list is in fact OPEN, because things are continually added to it.<br><br>You will still see some people here talking about the "backlog list" but that terminology is dead and should be avoided to prevent confusion.<br><br>Tessa,<br><br>If you understand the meaning of "closed" to be "the list is closed to new additions so that the items on it can be completed before I move on to new things" then is there still a problem?  The terminology (and the concept) comes from Mark's earlier works where he advised that you do not "do it today" but rather "do it tomorrow" when it comes to incoming work.  IOW, rather than jumping on every new thing you allocate your work for the day, do THAT, and put off new items.  This approach solves the problem of things languishing on your To Do list because time is continually allocated to new, and most likely more seemingly urgent, items.  Each day then, you "close" your list for the day and take on no new material until you've finished the old.<br><br>There is no sense at all of the WORK being closed, or the WORKER being closed for business ;-)  I'm a big fan of aligning the subconscious but you really don't need to try to keep an accurate description if that is your intent.  Why not just call it your FUN list?  Or your POSSIBILITIES list?  Or even your PINK list, if that makes you smile?<br><br>The think is that names are important to keep you focused on what things mean to you.  But if it is not the FUNCTION that is of interest, but rather the MOTIVATION, then use motivational terms and bag the functional description.  (I may start calling mine "Betty Boop!)</div>

<div class="content">I wonder if he has just lost interest or moved on to something else.  He's talked about the nomenclature a number of times but he seems to have more interesting things to do that clean up documentation.  I can relate ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Mike:<br><br>It's not so much that I've lost interest, more that I've gained a lot of other interests. I'm wondering now that I'm retired how I ever managed to fit running a business into my life!</div>

<div class="content">Tessa:<br><br>You can call the two lists whatever you like. "List A" and "List B" would be fine - or maybe even "Laurel" and "Hardy" or similar!</div>

<div class="content">For what it's worth (probably not much), my lists are called Now and Soon.  These names aren't really accurate, but they do convey a sense of "Get to Work" for me.  I am open to more perspicuous names.</div>

<div class="content">I have just discovered this system *tonight* and, boy, am I over the moon - systematic and yet engaging the instinctual, the intuition etc.  As a 'creative', this is exactly what I have been looking for!  The terms 'open' and 'closed' communicate well to a new user how the lists function.  However, once I begin to integrate and bond with the system, new terms may start to make more sense - so perhaps it depends at what point you are on your AF journey?</div>

<div class="content">Or, on reading more of the other discussion threads, it depends on where you are on your *time management* journey - a very personal journey to each individual.</div>
