<div class="content">Hi to all beta Autofocusers!<br><br>First of all I'd like to say a big thank you to Mark for sharing this method with us. Once refined it will certainly deserve to have a book written about it, though I'd understand if Mark is reluctant to take on another book! I'd be interested to know whether this method has influences from the journalling and continuous drafting methods that Mark has written about in the past.<br><br>A common problem I have with lists is that I create large and creative paper and/or electronic lists (DIT/GTD, project outlines, and other documents too) and then resist using them. I often never look at them again until ruefully throwing them away or deleting them years later well after they were useful (except as an exercise in regret and self-castigation). A 'lots and never' approach as opposed to 'little and often'.<br><br>With AF I have much less resistance to looking at the AF list than before. <br><br>Firstly, I can write very vague entries without feeling the pressure to immediately clarify them into next actions (as recommended in GTD) and let my mind dwell on them until they're clearer. This seems to suit my style as I'm not naturally decisive about open-ended issues.<br><br>Secondly, I only have to start one of the items on the page to honor my personal contract with my AF system; I know that looking at the page is not committing me to a large amount of time on a vague or distasteful task.<br><br>Finally, I don't dread getting behind on my AF list. If the list gets long and neglected I can simply dive in and start processing more ruthlessly (many of the items will be obsolete by then). I don't have to declare a shameful backlog (as recommended in DIT) or immediately determine next actions to issues I've forgotten about and not mentally 'processed' (as recommended in GTD).<br><br>Unusually, I also find myself  _itching_ to look at my personal AF list (which I always carry on me in a combined mini Filofax/DayRunner and wallet) at odd moments when it's unlikely I'll be able to do anything except add or remove items from the list.<br><br>Is peeking at the AF list without doing any items counter productive to the AF method? What about if I 'cheat' by peeking at other pages other than the current page?<br><br>I've just added another 'read Mark Forster discussion forum' at the end of my AF list.  Now I can stop worrying that I'll never read the forum again - I know that I will do it 'when the time is right' at some future pass through the AF list.<br></div>

<div class="content">Mike: <br><br>Here's hoping the task comes up quickly so you can read this answer!<br><br>On the subject of "peeking". The better your mind knows what's in the list, the better it's going to process it. That's why I recommend reading the whole list through if you have been away from it for an extended period. But there's no harm looking through it more often (unless of course you are just avoiding doing some work on it!)</div>

<div class="content">I've been 'peeking' from the start and I've found it really helps me to mull things over subconsciously while I'm working on other tasks. If I'm sitting watching TV and the programme isn't totally enthralling then I often read through all my pages even if I know I won't be able to do anything on any of the tasks on the active page. It just keeps me up to date with what I've got on my list and sometimes generates ideas for further tasks that I possibly wouldn't have otherwise thought of.<br><br>Another thing I've started to do today having now built up to 13 pages (not all of them active though) is to colour code the remaining outstanding tasks. It has given me an overview of the balance of various aspects of my life as well as an insight into which tasks are predominately still awaiting completion. I have found I have a heap of domestic and office (paperwork) tasks which isn't surprising as they aren't normally my first choice tasks. However, now I know this, it may influence which tasks 'stand out' to me when I run through my pages as I think intuitively I'll want to clear some of these now - as well of course that these will be the only types of tasks left on some pages.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Mark. I shall peek away without guilt! I find I do sometimes delete obsolete items while peeking.<br><br>I think the key maybe to do decide before I look at the list whether if I'm just reading or actually actioning the list and not let myself get away with just reading the list when I've committing to action.<br><br>Incidentally I also use random alernating page colours for my filofax AF list. This makes it easier to navigate as well as being a bit more fun and personallised.<br></div>
