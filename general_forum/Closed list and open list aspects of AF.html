<div class="content">One thing which perhaps I haven't stressed enough is that AF is designed to get the benefit of both closed and open lists. I'm becoming more and more convinced as I read the comments is that it's important for the working of the system to keep these two aspects in balance.<br><br>The way to do this is to control the amount of "little and often" that one is doing.<br><br>Symptoms of not enough "little and often" are:<br><br>1) slow movement through the list<br>2) excessive worry about deadlines<br>3) difficulty in leaving a task unfinished<br><br>Symptoms of too much "little and often" are:<br><br>1) tendency to spend most of one's time at the end of the list<br>2) lots of half-finished projects<br>3) superficial actions rather than real progress<br><br>Ask yourself:<br><br>  Am I getting through the list at least once on a normal day?<br><br>If the answer is YES, you are probably balanced in your approach to AF.<br><br>If the answer is NO, then ask yourself:<br><br>  Am I spending most of my time near the end of the list?<br><br>If the answer is YES, you are probably using too much "little and often". Although you are near the end of the list, you are re-entering actions so fast that you hardly ever get right to the end.<br><br>If the answer is NO, then you are probably using not enough "little and often" and are getting stuck on earlier pages.<br><br>Think of "little and often" as being like a knob on a radio. You can the sensitivity up or  down to get just the right balance.</div>

<div class="content">A very useful guideline, and I think it needed to be posted about now.  It might pay, in the final documentation, to provide such useful guidelines to tuning other parameters of the AF list ... for example: page length.</div>

<div class="content">Well, I am totally bewildered by Mark's last comment. I thought "little and often" was a key component of Autofocus.  I didn't say anything wrong with being at the end of my list, since I'm getting things done (or so I believed until now).  Now, having read this, I am worried that my progress has been only superficial, and that I'm somehow doing this wrong, even though it felt like it was working.  Clarification would be most welcome.</div>

<div class="content">One more thing.  What makes this even more confusing is that I am certain that Mark, only a few weeks ago, said that he usually spent most of his time near the end of this list.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Steve:<br><br>What's so confusing, Steve?<br><br>I said that TOO MUCH "little and often" is undesirable. Too much of anything is undesirable. <br><br>If you don't have a problem with your present setting of the "little and often" knob, then leave it where it is.</div>

<div class="content">Steve:<br><br>In response to your second post, yes I do spend most of my time at or near the end of the list, but I'm also doing a pass though the entire list at least once a day. It's when that doesn't happen that one can begin to suspect that one is out of balance.<br><br>I think it's much more common for people to be using not enough "little and often" than too much.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br>Thanks. <br>I guess I'm secretly concerned that the progress I've been making is not "real."  It's a neurotic concern;  I am getting tons of work done.  But since I am involved in a few large, long-term projects, there is a great deal of "unfinished work" in my life right now.  Somehow reading your post triggered some anxiety.  But I'm back in the saddle, and riding forward again.<br>best,<br>Steve</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for this, Mark – very timely. I definitely haven't been getting through the list at least once on a normal day, and that has been starting to feel like an issue. I seem to have a mix of symptoms, though (that is, of too much vs. not enough "little and often"), so I'm not sure how best to adjust. But I'll think about this. My hypothesis about slow movement had been a different one: that perhaps what I'm counting as "standing out" is too generous.</div>

<div class="content">Steve,<br>I am not sure if I am doing it right, but I don't feel I will be back to any other systems of the past, even to the to do list I used for five years despite GTD. There are two hindrances: first a bad habit, second, checking and reading this forum. ;- )<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Steve, I can relate to the fear factor you mention.  I've been working mainly at the end of my lists for a few days because of limited time availability but I think for me a big part of the fear factor relates to the fact that the system *is* working so well.  That in itself makes me think something must be wrong .......... because I can't stick to systems ....... :-)</div>

<div class="content">I think the amount of discretionary time you have plays a huge part in where on the list you spend most of your time.  On a good day during the work week, I only work on one or two pages on the home list, where I'll run through all 16 active pages on the weekend.<br><br>I only have 4 active pages at work and don't have an issue.  But then I just started this job on the day AF came out.<br></div>

<div class="content">Good post Mark, I guess it would be great to make some kind on FAQ with all these knowledge from the forum :) Even this advice with going through all the pages at least once a day would be really useful for newbies ...and symptoms as well :)</div>

<div class="content">Not getting through the pages once a day or even once every couple of days should also be a sign that you have taken too much on and need to re-examine your commitments.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline, it might not be a sign that you have taken on too much, but that you aren't using little and often enough or aren't as willing to dismiss as you should be. The whole "too many commitments" concept tends to invoke the need for decision making about importance--exactly that which AF makes unnecessary. Rereading this makes me want to get through my list quicker and also helps me see that I have some inappropriately worded tasks. For example, I have several tasks to watch specific movies. Movie watching is not conducive to little and often. Instead, I could have "Plan time to watch unwatched movie" or something like that. Thanks for bringing this thread back. It is helpful.</div>

<div class="content">Mel, that's what dismissal is though (for me) - accepting that I don't have the time to commit to that project at the expense of other things that I want to do - for now at least.   Maybe that's because I don't feel much resistance to doing most things as long as my energy level is there and I'm not feeling overwhelmed.  For me, not getting through my pages often enough was entirely due to the fact that I was attempting to take on too many projects at once - basically overloading the system and creating chaos all around me and overwhelm in my mind.   So I dismissed ALOT - I think something like 180+ tasks in my home book.  <br><br>In some cases, there has to be decision making about things to take on.  For example, if I'm doing a home renovation and I have $X and X time to complete it in, I'm not going to put in the "nice to have's" at the expense of the essentials.  Sometimes some things really are more important than others.  <br><br>I've also clarified to myself that getting my house renovated before on time really is more important than having it spic and span all the time.  So I've dialed up my little and often on the house cleaning items and dialed it down on the renovation items by changing the wording or grouping or ungrouping things.  <br><br>This was one of Mark's most helpful posts to me and I think more people should read it.</div>

<div class="content">Mel:<br><br>I watch movies "little and often" all the time. The important thing is to write down the timer reading so you know where to start from next time if your system doesn't remember it.</div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline, I knew that's what you meant as you've shared your mass dismissal. :-) I agree with you, but don't want people to think they have to make rational decisions about what to do and what not to do. It's been wonderful for me to dismiss things and discover later that some of these tasks do in fact get done. I just don't have to have them on my radar screen in the meantime.<br><br>Mark, I was actually thinking about this after I wrote it. I just finished watching Casablanca in 3 sessions last week. :-) The movies I'm having trouble with are movies I want my kids to watch with me. That will require scheduling as they're not likely to go along with my little and often plan. Nor are they very willing to drop everything to watch a movie when it happens to pop up on my list. :-)</div>
