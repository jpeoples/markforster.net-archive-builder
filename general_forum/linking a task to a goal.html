<div class="content">I used to be a fan of the online task managerToodledo <br><br><a href="http://www.toodledo.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.toodledo.com/</a><br><br>One thing I really liked was that each task could be linked to an overarching goal, and at any time you could sort by the goals you've set up.<br><br>It was a nice way to keep motivated about why a task existed and what you were really trying to accomplish.<br><br>Now that I'm 100% paper and pen with AutoFocus, that's the one feature I find I miss. Anyone use a technique to manage something like this?<br></div>

<div class="content">I never found goals to be all that motivating. If anything, there were demotivating. If something is important, you will know it and that will come into play when allowing a task to stand out.<br><br>IME.</div>

<div class="content">Luciano Passuello (linked on this site) has written about some interesting ways to bring things to the surface, covering difficult things like goal setting and problem solving. Like Norman U says, goal setting can be demotivating, and especially so if you have it in the form of a statement with no idea of how it is going to pan out or whether you are making any progress with it.<br><br>But brainstorming in the form of "why" questions, or writing out a list of 100 reasons why you have to do something, and you have a more interactive way of dealing with them.<br><br>I have some of these methods written out as AF tasks at the moment, and when they throw up some do-able tasks, they go right into my AF list.<br><br>Maybe this is one way of making goals more alive and interactive. Do check out the site, it may be your cup of tea.</div>

<div class="content">For linking tasks to goals I often use an advice from David Allen.<br>Write: _task/action_  re: _goal/project_. <br><br>E.g. "call Bill re: this month's budget", "clear deck re: weekend party", "draft report re: safety inspection", "call auto shop re: tires", etc.</div>

<div class="content">I could not disagree more with the idea that goals are demotivating.  I can't imagine how they could be.  That is the whole reason for taking an action in the first place.  But whatever ...<br><br>As Rainer said, one can link it in the title in some way: "Call Dr. (broken arm)" kind of thing.<br><br>As a matter of personal experience, I pretty much know why I want to do something.  I mean, if I have a goal to "Climb Mt. Everest" and I have actions sprinkled on my list like:<br><br>- Buy Rope<br>- Sharpen Ice Axe<br><br>I pretty much recall why I want to do them ;-)</div>

<div class="content">I started off this year and AF with a list of 10 goals.  What I did at the beginning of working with AF was to review those goals once a week and identify tasks that would move me forward on each goal.  <br><br>There were a few goals that I dropped as I realized after a couple of months in working with AF that they weren't really all that important to me this year.  I kept on dismissing the actions required and that seemed to me to be a good sign that they weren't the right goals for me right now.  <br><br>There were another couple that I have developed good habits for and don't really need a system to manage them, I just want to monitor my progress.  <br><br>The other goals that I have really taken on and am making good progress on, I see as requiring recurring tasks.  I don't need a reminder of why I want to achieve them - after these last 5 months they are very ingrained - so every time I cross one out, I write another task related to that goal down.   I had unconsciously let one go for awhile when I stopped reviewing my goals every week (thinking in using AF, it was handled), but in reviewing my goals one weekend, I realized I hadn't worked on that one for awhile.   So, I've learned not to completely rely on the system to keep me moving along, I have to bring things back on track once in awhile.<br><br>ds, I think the only way to do what you want in AF is to review your goals on a weekly basis, unless you want to have the overhead of maintaining something off your list like a progress chart or similar.  That's something that I would take the time to do if a goal was very important to me and kept slipping off my radar.<br><br>I suppose goals can be demotivating - if you never achieve them.  Or don't know what you really want.  If something isn't on the list to begin with, it would be kind of hard for it to stand out.</div>

<div class="content">I was using Toodledo with AF for a long time. I had as a task on my AF list "Add goals to list." This meant I was to take time to go through each task and assign it to a goal via Toodledo. I quit doing it. I think one reason I quit was because some of the goals didn't have a due date. For me, amorphous goals with no end in sight aren't motivating. Of course, many would argue they aren't goals at all and I wouldn't put up a fuss. ;-) Obviously a second reason is the goals stopped being important to me.<br><br>For projects with due dates that require a good amount of time, I am using DoThisFirst on the iPhone. I think this has replaced my goals accounting I was doing on Toodledo. I love that the program tells me how much time I should commit today to achieve my goal/project by when it's due. The program also tells me how much progress I've made toward the goal/project, but without requiring me to detail every tiny step. There's none of that in fact. I had a goal of tagging all my digital photos by the end of August. Putting this into AF has meant I've done it a few times--not nearly enough to achieve my goal. Now that I am using this approach, I will set a new goal with a new due date and will put it into DoThisFirst to see if I make progress. If I don't, it's obviously not a goal I'm willing to keep pursuing. I allow myself to work either DTF or AF as I choose during the day.<br><br>To use a DTF approach on paper, you would need a separate list of due-dated, time-intensive goals or projects. Estimate the number of hours it will take you to complete the project and a percentage of buffer time you want. For ease of explanation, let's say you have a goal/project to be completed a month from now. If that project will take approximately 30 hours to complete, you'd need to spend an hour a day on it. But if you know you won't be able to work every day (and who will?), you need to factor that in. If you have a 25% buffer, you'd need to work an hour and fifteen minutes on the project every day. <br><br>The rebel procrastinator in me does sometimes look at that figure and say naaaaah. But the logical part of me realizes what I'm in for every day that goes by that I do not work on it. I can no longer use ignorance the way I once did to manage my checking account. ;-) This is an obvious process that we've all used for special circumstances, but could benefit from using more often.</div>

<div class="content">If goals dictate your actions, goals are motivating, and the actions to reach your goal are obvious, then why all the fuss over systems and psychological speculation required to fulfill your goals.<br><br>You know what you want, you know the next step, and you are motivated.<br><br>Congratulations.</div>

<div class="content">Why the fuss? <br><br>Because I have to fight the constant urge to say "screw it" and go sit on my deck reading a book and sipping on a wobbly pop rather than working on something a little more meaningful than a tan and a buzz.</div>

<div class="content">Then goals in themselves must not be motivating.</div>

<div class="content">Rotfl Jacqueline. I am assuming wobbly pop is our Popsicle. <br><br>Norman, do you have something in your life that is perpetually motivating? I really don't. Not even extreme fear can do it because exhaustion sets in. I can't keep my motivation at 100% at all times and I suspect I'm not the only one. Sometimes recording and tracking goals is highly motivating. Sometimes I am too motivated to need that. Other times these approaches don't work. Then I need to find another source of motivation or abandon the goal. If that makes me part of this board's dross, count me as content.</div>

<div class="content">Hmm, I thought I was saying the opposite.  That because I don't really have a burning desire to do something for the sheer love of the process but I desire the outcome very much, if I focus on the goal and how to get there, I'll be motivated to overcome my inertia.  <br><br>You're reminding me of these sayings on despair.com<br><a href="http://despair.com/lithographs.html#" rel="nofollow">http://despair.com/lithographs.html#</a><br><br>If a pretty poster and a cute saying are all it takes to motivate you, you probably have a very easy job. The kind robots will be doing soon.<br><br>Let's agree to respect each others views, no matter how wrong yours may be.<br><br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">No Mel, it's a Canadian phrase for a beer or cooler.  Although I imagine one could freeze them into a popsicle... I feel strangely motivated to try that now that summer's here.  I'll have to make it one of my goals for this weekend. :-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline - at the risk of digressing what's a cooler? I'm assuming it's not an ice box! :-)</div>

<div class="content">It is called a "wobbly pop" because too many will make you "wobbly"! A cooler is a combination of flavoured carbonated water and some other kind of alchohol, like vodka. Low alchohol content means you can drink more on a hot day. About the same strength as a beer. Cheers!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine, at least you kept it short!  :-)  A cooler is an alcoholic drink made with vodka or rum and juices - or fake juice I guess.  Now you'll be wanting me to send you some along with Mike's strawberry icecream!<br><br>Re. goals, although obviously I think it's important to have good goals, I still maintain that everyone has goals, whether written or not, whether monitored or not, whatever other name they may give to them - all they are is defined desired outcomes or intentions - nothing more.  <br><br>Where some people can get led astray with them however, is to be extremely attached to a specific outcome that doesn't transpire.   That's where process types of goals can be so beneficial.   That and maybe some training in Buddhist non-attachment...<br><br>The one thing that well defined goals can offer someone though, is clarity.  There are just too many demands on our time these days to do this or do that.  Goals define what is really important to *you* though.</div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline, thank you for a wonderful laugh! You are too funny. Frozen wobbly pops would be delish, but you might need to hide them from the kids. lol</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Gordon & Jacqueline for the info - and Jacqueline please feel free to send some any time you like :-)<br><br>I've decided to learn text speak to to keep my posts shorter still - won't that B GR8!</div>

<div class="content">The trouble with text speak is that on a computer it takes longer both to read and write. But of course that doesn't stop it being cool!</div>
