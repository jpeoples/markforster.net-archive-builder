<div class="content">Today I was scheduled to take time off for vacation.  However, circumstances at work mean I can't leave now.  (I'm the owner, and it's important to me.)  Actually, just preparing and planning to take off was proving to be stressful and now that I'm not taking off, that stress is gone.<br><br>Nevertheless I'm declaring myself to be virtually on vacation.  Therefore aside from going to work every day, I'm considering all my ordinary obligations at home to be completely non-pressing.  I think in fact though I will still do things around the house, but without feeling any pressure to either do them or not do them, I shall be able to relax.<br><br>It's quite nice!  :-)<br><br>Hopefully things go well at work and I can take that real vacation soon.  We'll see.</div>

<div class="content">Ha! Reminds me of Al Bundy's "world tour" on the couch in his living room (from the American sit-com _Married ... with Children_).<br><br><a href="http://www.hulu.com/watch/31174/marriedwith-children-the-goodbye-girl" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.hulu.com/watch/31174/marriedwith-children-the-goodbye-girl</a><br><br>Too funny!</div>

<div class="content">Sometimes the stress of getting ready for a vacation is a good thing, it forces you to simplify and delegate and get rid of the non-essentials.<br><br>A virtual vacation won't be the same thing as a real vacation, and it won't necessarily make much of an improvement to your stress levels once you get back to work.</div>

<div class="content">Jim,<br>"Sometimes the stress of getting ready for a vacation is a good thing," yes, sometimes.<br><br>"it forces you to simplify and delegate and get rid of the non-essentials." It tries.<br><br>"A virtual vacation won't be the same thing as a real vacation,"  Of course not.<br><br>"and it won't necessarily make much of an improvement to your stress levels once you get back to work. "<br><br>But I haven't left work.  I can't leave yet.  I've simply chosen to take it easy outside of work hours.  I'm not following an AF list of things to do for now, I'm trying to put aside thoughts of "must do".  <br><br>It's a mind game really.  The game is, "If I were really on vacation now, I couldn't do XYZ anyway.  Therefore I'm not going to worry about it being done or not done."  As it happens I'm getting a lot of things done that I never had time for because I was "too busy".<br><br>Anyway enough posting for today.  I've got things I don't have to do but which I want to so I will.</div>
