<div class="content">Folks,<br><br>I just want to make sure I understand Mr. Forster's guide for starting AF (i.e. the new and improved AF1+2).<br><br>1. Don't put a tremendous number of tasks on the list to begin with. Don't front load it! Things will be added as you go along.<br><br>2. You don't draw and lines across the page on DAY1, do you?<br><br>3. At the beginning of DAY2, you draw a line after the first contiguous block of unactioned items. These are "on notice" for review, which would happen on DAY3.<br><br>4. NO items would be on review on DAY2 (i.e. you wouldn't highlight any)<br><br>5. At the beginning of DAY3 you would put on review (highlight) all unactioned items above the line. You would then draw a new line after the first contiguous block of unactioned items.<br><br>Does this look correct? Any additions or clarifications?<br><br>Thanks!<br>--Joseph</div>
