<div class="content">Hi Mark and others, <br><br>Well I managed about 2 days without another question! I'm back at work after a bout of man flu and I'm unsure how to approach emptying my inboxes with AF. <br><br>For example with emails, should I...<br><br>1: Write something to the effect of 'clear emails' on my AF list - and then cross the item out and re-write it untill the task is done, at the same time taking tasks out of the emails and listing them in AF.<br><br>2: Write 'clear emails' only once that day and cross the item out when I'm leaving the office.<br><br>3: Schedule a time (eg first thing in the morning) to empty all of my in boxes and list related tasks into the AF list. <br><br>Appologies if this question has already been answered - I would be happy to be re-directed to a relevant link.</div>

<div class="content">Leon:<br><br>I think this is something about which individuals can decide what works for them best. But for the record my practice is to have a recurring item "Email" and deal with them as one batch, extracting any particularly complicated or difficult ones as separate tasks.</div>

<div class="content">That approach certainly worked for me - being out for nearly two days email was one thing I was not prompted to do in the time I did have, but I cleared it in several recurring sessions very easily yesterday.</div>
