<div class="content">Here's a question for all you creative thinkers on this Forum. As you know, I've made the AF system itself entirely free of charge. But I'm conscious of all those bankers and politicians who need my taxes to keep them in the style to which they are accustomed - so I feel an obligation to do my bit by earning more than I do at the moment.<br><br>So here's the challenge: How can I make pots of money out of AF? I've already thought of the obvious things like run seminars and write a book. But how about some not so obvious suggestions?</div>

<div class="content">Even though you're not a proponent of digital solutions, iphone apps for instance make a tidy some of money and AF is well suited to this. This would involve having AF go viral as well.<br><br>Obviously, you can do a Covey and provide special AF notebooks and other stationary. <br><br>Possibly time consuming, but training people to be AF/Dit/time management coaches and having them go out in both the business and personal world.<br><br>Speaking at big (corporate) events who pay 5 figures or more.<br><br>teaching the government autofocus and being exempt from taxes as a reward<br><br>Is there going to be a book that is just about Autofocus? How long would that take before it's published? <br><br>Ideas like speed!</div>

<div class="content">Mark, I do believe you deserve the greatest of pots of money (!!)  from your brilliant  AF system. *thank you.*<br><br>I just want to be clear that  this is the question: "How can I make the basic AF system available free of charge, while packaging it in other more value-added ways to make pots of $?<br></div>

<div class="content">Make AF / AUTOFOCUS into a brand / cool logo and sell all kinds of branded AF merchandise in addition to Peter's great ideas about AF books/ stationery - pens, pencils, highlighters, calendars with tips or quotes maybe from all your books, (perpetual or dated) bags, hats, t-shirts, etc. ( I am using Levenger's CIRCA smaller size and it would be really cool to have a branded AF cover ... I am wanting a little cover/folder with a pen loop or two and some pockets.)<br><br>Sell an expanded version as an e-book or on Kindie (I think that's supposed to be pretty fast).<br><br>Also .. loved Peter's idea of the iPhone/ ipod Touch app !!<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Well Mark, that got a lot of quick responses!<br><br>I would suspect that, as you once tried to retire, freedom of time is important to you so ideas that leave you with time, yet the ability to get involved and "teach the system" seem an ideal scenario.  Branding the system, creating the Covey type system, writing a book, training others all seem to be great ways of achieving the financial side without compromising on the time freedom element.<br><br>In addition to the electronic solutions for handhelds, a genuine software option could be a possibility, not as an afterthought or make-do, but tailored specifically and with the ability to link to Outlook or other "recognised" programs.  There are a number of smaller but excellent software companies around that may be very willing to partner with you in that production.</div>

<div class="content">I agree with Peter - he has 2 good ideas :<br><br>1) web/mobile app which is using AF system and in the same time can also add second part which is about reminders and other things with deadlines not used in AF -> this way it will be possible  have all tasks in one place. Part of the system can be free and some extra options with additional fee.<br><br>2) nice stationery with perfect number of lines and good pen attached to it , everything with nice logo -> so you have complete AF system to carry with you.<br><br>Stationery can have mini version of AF instructions inside  the cover - this way it can be nice gift and in the same time good way to spread AF method among friends  :)</div>

<div class="content">1. You could create an AF franchise or some kind of certified / licensed program  to permit others to conduct training sessions / seminars in return for a startup fee or royalties.<br><br>2. Similar,  you could license to coaches to use as part of their 'toolkit'.<br><br>3. Lots of people on the forum have been agonising over whether they should use paper or electronic methods.    Design a nice leather or faux leather folder / forms to sell at a vast uplifted price.   Or design a piece of 'authorised' software  or  outlook plugin...</div>

<div class="content">I think the best ideas are:<br><br>DVD or downloads of a seminar, so once it is done you can make money passively<br>Train people to teach the method, ie certified in AF, this is basically more seminars, but if it is "franchised" and extends to corporate training, you can get royalties or up front franchise fees from the efforts of others.<br>Also, GTD has a pay website, with articles, forums etc.  Not that I want to see this since you have been so generous with your time and have done this so far for free, but several people have pay websites and subscriptions.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Update the instructions to include a task "Send Mark Forster $10 via PayPal."  People will do it once it stands out, meaning once they really feel the value, this will stand out to them.  Or they do it little and often and send you $1 a week. And if they dismiss it, they'll also know the system's working.<br><br>The key is to find passive income with relatively low costs on your end.</div>

<div class="content">These things can overlap.  Book, seminar, DVD, etc. If people like something and want to learn it, they will pursue it through different media.  Website is good too. <br>But some kind of seminar -- with a demonstration of how a few hours of "autofocused living" really work, could be extremely effective.<br>Hmm.... "Autofocused Living" -- I can't tell if that's got a ring to it or not, but if you like it Mark, it's yours!</div>

<div class="content">You could also write a series of books that you either co-author or contract out for specific populations (e.g., Autofocus for Students; Autofocus for Moms; Autofocus for the Self-Employed; Autofocus for Homeschoolers). I concur with all the other ideas suggested and would be very interested in teaching this method as a speaker. Giving speakers a steep discount on licensed products and books is a great way to share the wealth. You might want to revamp the website to allow for more encouragement of those using AF. I would like to see a way of sharing number of tasks completed (so that high scorers are listed), tasks most often dismissed, and of connecting with people using AF who have similar work or interests. The writing thread is a great example of the latter. <br><br>Mark, we wish you all the best because you've given us yours.</div>

<div class="content">Oooh, another product idea. FlyLady has these clings that stick to everything. Seeing her cartoon likeness on your fridge or washer can motivate you to do household tasks. What if you made a cling that had an AutoFocus logo and said something like, "What page are you on?" Using the "page" concept, you could create your support groups for "people on the same page." Okay, I need to get back to my page. :-)</div>

<div class="content">In the past, I worked for an ecommerce company.  We had a guy who made boatloads of money selling a book along the lines of "Everything You Need to Know About Relationships in 23 Pages or Less."   He sold it as an ebook.<br><br>Everyone is so busy they don't want to take the time to read a 300+ page book about how to more effectively manage time.  A twenty page book at the right price about a time management book that is easy to follow could likely do VERY well.  Selling as an ebook means you don't have to worry about shipping and also gets it in the readers' hands much quicker.  That is also a short enough book most people wouldn't mind printing it out if they want it as a handy reference.<br><br>An alternative... The author of the book Scratch Beginnings gave it away for free right after it was released. Basically anyone interested enough to email him would get a free copy.  I guess he thought the book was good enough most people would like it enough to buy it. Not sure how well he did with that. Oh, I need to put reading that book on my list :-)<br><br>I also like the idea of creating some software that allows you to implement the AutoFocus system as none of them seem to work quite right. Most of them are focused around some more complicated system - ABC priorities (like the Franklin Covey system) or contexts/tags (GTD apps).  <br><br>One more thing: If you could partner up with a pen company that makes a pen that would work well for the analog version of your system.  There are some pens out there that have multiple ink colors and markers built-in.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark, I would support a donation - perhaps it could be invested in training older kids who have difficulty with study and time management related skills (feeling overwhelmed etc. in today's busy world) - Modelling Tony Buzan and his Mind Map Seminars etc. <br><br>Personally I would *hate* to see any of your products branded, not that I know you personally but I don't think it's you really. The fact that one can do AF successfully any A4 style Note book is a key strength for me and so unpretentious. No offence intended to other posters.</div>

<div class="content">Go through the comments and distill them into FAQs. Package the basic instructions with the FAQs and sell as a low-priced eBook -- while making it clear that instructions are still available on web site at no charge. People who don't want to spend time searching through the comments for their particular question will appreciate having a paid version that includes details, and that they can print out as a pdf.</div>

<div class="content">Do you know the story of Bethlehem Steel's Charles Schwab paying the amount of money he thought a time management system was worth to him? (He paid $25,000, saying it was the most profitable lesson he had learned. Google "$25,000 idea Schwab" if you want to read the story.)<br><br>You could ask AF users to Paypal you the amount of money they feel AF has been worth to them. :o)</div>

<div class="meta">2009-02-10 9:43</div>
<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>I like all of the ideas presented so far.  Very exhaustive.<br><br>Firstly, the problem:  You can't really "sell" AutoFocus because it is just an idea ... a list of instructions on how to do something.  You can sell various implementations of it.  This is where the ideas about notebooks, pens, and software come in ... and they all seem good.<br><br>The Analog Solution:  I agree that short is best.  I also agree that less discussion about the whys of it is good.  I think that people want RULES.  Just give them a very condensed list of rules, much as you did with your first go, but more cleaned up.  It has to be clear as crystal so there is NO room for questions or misunderstandings.  "Do this than do that and don't ask questions and it will change your life."  That is what most people are looking for.  (And, BTW, what you are basically already doing that makes AF so good.)<br><br>People love gadgets so in this realm I'd be selling stationary and branded products.  Make a line of stationary in various form factors, with a flow chart, instructions and pretty colors and motivational quotes and such into a kit with very practical pens, markers, Post-It flags, page markers, whatever.  The downside to this is that you are now in the retail business and income is related to time and manpower.  I'd probably want to design the product then find someone who is already in that business to implement it for you and just take a royalty for it.<br><br>The Digital Solution:  This leverages your time better, IMO.  Software can be distributed via the Internet and you'd not have to go to the post office ;-)  If you were to publish software, I have one bit of advice: Make it SIMPLE.  Don't get some kid who is a wizard at World of Warcraft to do it for you ... get a professional who understands BUSINESS.  You don't want to end up supporting users who have bugs in all of the "cool" features that they don't need or want anyway ... read "Microsoft" there  ;-)<br><br>Any software solution should cover EVERYTHING that needs to be done but no more.  IOW, it needs to handle a calendar, contacts, an easy to use AF list, and email.  This implies that it should run on a smart phone and/or run on a PC linking to Outlook.  However, the road to software development can be a rocky one.<br><br>Donations:  That should really be your first step.  It takes nothing more than asking your website guy to put a link up to collect money.  You can have that up and running tomorrow!  I love the idea of "what is it worth to you".  People will often give more than you'd ask for.  One thing that might be helpful is to think about putting some kind of metrics into your system.  In the first place, it is not a bad productivity idea to know how productive you are.  Secondly, it might help you show people how good the system works for them and so how much money they ought to give you ;-) The downside there is that it complicates a simple system.  A trade-off to be sure.  Maybe a second system for those who want metrics?  (Probably the manager types.)<br><br>Oh, one other idea you already got but was kind of buried was to focus on applications.  "AF for housewives", "AF for IT professionals, "AF for Artists", "AF for retired people", "AF for Musicians"  etc.  You have a thread where people divulged their professions so you can ask specific questions of persons in each profession about what they needed to change from the basic AF to make it fit well for them and make a separate "product" for each.  I.E. a separate notebook kit, a separate software product, etc.  You could do things like have some pages of music notation paper for the musicians and unrulled pages for the artists, etc.  All kinds of tweaks I can think of.<br><br>Anyway, just some ramblings this morning.  ;-)  I'd examine how Steven Covey and David Allen did it.  They is had basically the same problem ... an idea and how to market it.  Hell, I'd write them and ask for pointers!</div>

<div class="content">How about this Dilbert-Dogbert-type of solution:<br><br>Add a small amendment to the instructions, like "the number of items on a page must always equal the number of non-empty pages in your notebook".<br>Then sell tons of software, books, videos, and seminars that help people to cope with the problems that arise from this  amendment.<br>:-)<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>A few quick ideas:<br><br>wide view:<br>1. donation buttons in markforster.com. Quick, easy, leverage the experiences and feedback from the Beta test.<br>2. Write a short book, release as an ebook. Quite quick, build on experiences, add value.<br>3. Write a short book, publish a limited expanded print edition. Build on the readership of your previous books. Many people like to have a bound printed copy.<br>4. Create a short, new, higher-level book that knits together the best ideas from AF and its predecessors.  Many people arrive via different routes and may be confused as to what to use when. Create some valuable new content. Interesting for you and us!<br>5. Hold web- or tele-seminars to walk through examples and do Q&A. Easy to set up, scalable.<br>6. Create a series of podcasts exploring aspects of AF, and charge a Euro for each.<br>7. Teach AF to other productivity sites and cross-pollenate to new users (e.g. 43 folders).<br>8. Publicise AF via interviews on other sites/podcasts/journals/newspapers.<br>9. Create a customised AF stationeryset: workbook, calendar. Maybe include some DIT sheets too?<br>10. Write or seminar on how to use AF to link more to goals, and how to review progress and enhance the AF experience.<br>11. A simple Web implementation of AF.<br>12. An Iphone or similar implementation delivered via Itunes store.<br>13. Produce a new book which includes many of the interesting ideas that have been in your newsletters over the past few years.<br>14. Start a competition with a decent prize for the 3 best ideas and get feedback from users, coaching colleagues and other web sites!<br><br>Narrow view:<br>1. Revisit previous companies who you have given seminars in the past.<br>2. Find new companies and propose a good-value seminar to provide to many employees<br>3. Provide specialised coaching.<br><br>Thanks Mark.</div>

<div class="content">This isn't a new product idea, but how about including stories of people whose lives were changed using AF in your book or newsletter? Testimonials are fine, but I'd be interested to read how people's lives are impacted longer term. You might want to look at www.flylady.net. Her emails and websites describing the system, giving tips, and testimonials are free. However, she has written a book for people who aren't Internet-savvy and has created a range of products that aren't essential to the system, but many people still want. I don't think anyone begrudges her making money from these and the free aspect certainly helped to create her huge following. She has partnered with people whose expertise complements hers and travels around the country doing free seminars with them where they sell gobs of products. I only hope if you go that route that you will come to the US or will permit others to teach here. HTH</div>

<div class="content">I agree that the donation idea is a good one--this system has helped me out so much I'd be happy to contribute!   Later on some short, explanatory PDFs that could be purchased for further instruction.  "AutoFocus for Educators," "Autofocus for Knowledge Workers, along with a FAQ one and maybe some for software like "Using AutoFocus with Outlook," "AutoFocus with Lotus Notes," "AutoFocus with online applications," etc.  Also short essays from your past work but rewritten for AF: "Little and Often," etc.<br><br>You could either collate these into a new book or rewrite Do It Tomorrow since Autofocus seems to be a logical extension of DIT.<br><br>Thanks, Mark!</div>

<div class="content">Get this made into a mobile phone game. More people carry a mobile phone than carry a pen and paper nowadays. This type of application/?game would be well suited to portable devices such as Blackberry and maybe even NintendoDS. The AutoFocus system has a computer game like addiction. You keep coming back to it  and want to keep checking it and improve your to do list score. Also I think the scrolling effects could work well in choosing the most appropiate action. I realise this idea might be a bit fantastic but with the right help ? Thanx for this system  Mark I'm finally smashing my to do list. Hope you make loads from it.<br>10trevor</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br>I agree with others who have said ask for a donation.  I'm so happy with the sheer simplicity and ease of use of AutoFocus that I would gladly give you a bit of money.<br><br>I believe that you should limit the products you add/create to electronic delivery only - therefore giving you the freedom to keep your own time in check and do what you want, but also giving those who want to use AF the opportunity to get any additional AF support products at no additional charge.<br><br>I also think you should let the user community help you develop materials and resources and then find some sort of affiliate's program that would share the revenue from products either they delivered and gave to the community or to products they recommended and reviewed.  <br><br>I think it would be good to have an online AF user conference at some point in time.  Find some sort of online forum site we could use for a day or two, charge a low admission charge, and set up forums by topic area/implementation style.<br><br>I also like the concept of an e-book with the system itself along with categorized tips/FAQs.<br><br>Thanks so much for AF - I can't tell you how much it has helped me.</div>

<div class="content">The beauty of AF is in its simplicity which lends itself extremely well for iPhone type apps as previously mentioned.  Everyone can benefit from AF and everyone is constantly searching for a way to get a better handle on their workload, so the iPhone style 'micro-payment' strategy of such apps would make it a no-brainer once word got out.<br><br>Of course, for us dinosaurs, a simple yet slick branded notebook ala Moleskin would also be a hit I would think.  Include the instructions in the notebook and keep the notebook<br>small enough so it's trivial to carry around at all times (and replace as filled frequently).<br></div>

<div class="content">OK, this one's a bit out of left field, but here goes.<br><br>How about some sort of "Biggest Loser" style productivity challenge.<br><br>Find a number of people fully committed to improving their productivity with AF (but who haven't tried it yet).  Decide on some reasonably objective way of measuring productivity.<br><br>Then set them onto AF, and track their productivity progress daily.  After some set period, work out how much AF has improved each person's productivity, and then decide a winner (or winners).<br><br>I know there's some tricky details in there (how does one find the participants, how to measure progress etc), but the sort of testimonials coming out of that process will be invaluable.  Plus if you can quantify the improvement AF brings (eg it made every single participant at least 30% more productive), selling whatever you want to sell is going to be that much easier.  Depending on how you run the contest, you could make some of the content subscriber only and charge a small fee, too.</div>

<div class="content">I like Kenny D's idea - sell it as an ebook.  Include the basic instructions, plus some of Mark's usual excellent discourse elaborating on the principles and the nuances.  Maybe include summaries of the some of the more poignant discussions that have arisen in this forum.  Put all that in a PDF package of 20-40 pages and you could easily charge $10 or $20 for it.  (Sorry, don't know how that translate into GBP).</div>

<div class="content">If you added a "store" or "products we like" page to your site, you could become an affiliate for products or services that you really like and would recommend for others ... was especially thinking about this as your web site traffic will continue to grow with the "freely available" AF.<br><br>(was just using a timer for a task on my AF list, and was thinking about getting a more *aesthetically pleasing* one -- seeing as it is also a tool I use frequently, and  so that brought up this idea as to what other products you know, like and could introduce to your site visitors.)</div>

<div class="content">Ugh, I'm such a contrarian.  I'm cringing reading the above ideas by-and-large. "" Make this" or "market that" seems so anti-AF.  I mean this in the sense of AF's beautiful simplicity.  What is it with our nature (mine included) to take the simple and adorn it?<br><br>What I see is that Mark had NOT really invented a darn (tangible)  thing. Certainly not a To-Do list.  What he has done is created a way of>> thinking about<< the to-do list.<br><br>So Mark, you're the kind of guy I want to listen to now.  If you can do this with a to-do list, I gotta imagine you can make another leap.  AF has increased the worth of your personal stock already!<br><br>If you want cash, wait a bit. As word spreads, those obvious things you thought of will spin off all you need.  If you want to make a dry-erase board version of a to do list with a 4 color silkscreened logo (I hope no one suggested that already :->) I'd be disappointed personally.<br><br>Oh and because you asked, here's my serious suggestion:  A bright, small, 5 page (max) pamphlet that teachers can use to instruct kids.

<div class="content">I agree with Don. Merchandising just for the sake of it seems to be contrary to the whole AF idea/atmosphere. I just did not post my opinions on this before because I did not know how to put it politely. Don has spoken up, so here I am supporting his view.<br><br>As far as the alternatives presented are concerned, I think donations would work, and also the pamphlet thing. It would be nice to spread the word outside the internet. The pamphlets could be distributed like the Ubuntu CDs, maybe not completely free of charge, of course. Perhaps people could donate also to cover the costs of those pamphlets (plus Mark's copy rights), so poorer people could get them for a reasonable fee, or no fee at all?<br><br>Anyway, the AF notebook idea coupled with the pamplhet printed on it is not really all that bad. Of course AF is about using simple tools, tools anyone can find anywhere (I think I found the perfect, cheap notebook for me already). But the "official AF" notebook could be a good idea to introduce people to AF and to show them what to look for in a notebook and how to work the system... Maybe instructions reinforcing the principles on the first few pages, helping people to follow the processes? After their first "official AF" notebook, they could go on buying it, but they would also know they could just buy any other notebook they feel like. :) Of course, with enough lines on each page. (I learnt it the hard way.)<br><br>Anyway, Mark, I hope you can sift through this ideas using AF. :)</div>

<div class="content">I've used lulu.com several times and the quality of book created is very nice. You can sell printed copies and\or ebook versions of whatever you upload. <br><br>Using their book calculator, you can see how much it will cost to print the book with whatever options you choose (size, binding, color or BW, number of pages). Then you set the price you want to sell the books for. Lulu takes a cut and you get a check for the rest.  Their templates are easy to use, and the best part is they handle all of the fulfillment - take the money\printing\shipping. You get a free webpage where people order the book and can leave comments about it. <br><br>Through Lulu, you could have "The AutoFocus Time Management System" book, as well as create actual notebooks ("Life" or "Work" on the cover, 30 lines per page, top corners have a square where the X and circle go to mark completed pages, inspiring quotes in the footer, whatever) to sell. <br><br>You can of course buy copies of your own books, and they give discounts for bulk orders, so you can have the book and notebook on hand to sell in person at any of your speaking engagements. Once you've created and uploaded the file, you don't have to do anything else so it's a lovely method of passive income.</div>

<div class="content">Don't know if this is of interest to you, but rather than write a "how to" autofocus book, what about a "why it works" AF book?  To me, this system is fascinating, because it's so simple in its description & implementation, but so ingenious in how it works with our minds/brains.<br><br>There's lots of potential material:<br><br>- integrating the rational & intuitive minds in executive function<br><br>- rewards for working on a task, rather than completing the task<br><br>- review & planning are seamlessly integrated into the execution process<br><br>- the way that you can write tasks at any level of granularity from "build house" to "hammer next nail" on the same list.  (This is one of my personal favorites.)<br><br>- why it works so well for procrastinators<br><br>- sure that you could find lots of interesting research on decision making, attention, motivation, rewards, etc etc to bring to the table.<br><br>Noone would need this book to use AF, but I bet lots of people would find it interesting.  Think Malcom Gladwell crossed w/ a great time mgmt seminar.<br><br>If you don't want to write this book, I think I might!</div>

<div class="content">As a college student, I think one business opportunity for you would be selling a pamphlet in college bookstores. If you can make it slim (perhaps bundled with a Moleskine or other notebook) and cheap, and title it something snappy (Autofocus is snappy, but college students will respond well to titles involving their grades), I think it would sell well. Alternatively, you might consider podcasting, and selling a 15 or 30 second ad at the beginning of that podcast. It would be informative, easy, and straight profit (outside your time). <br><br>One other option is to license a website devoted to Autofocus. I would encourage you to make it a full-blown website, not just an app-- you should certainly have an app attached, but I think it is key that people be able to access it from their desk as well as their phone. Even if you charge $5/year (or a similarly reasonable amount) plus a few dollars for the app itself, you'll pull in some money. Perhaps shift these forums to that website and build it up as a community, while enjoying the profit. <br><br>I agree with the ebook folks, but I think a tangible slim volume sold on a college/university campus would sell rapidly.</div>

<div class="content">Catherine CS's post made me think of the Open Source model.  There are many companies, some of them very large, that make their living providing support for Open Source systems.  The software itself is free -- the expertise is not.<br><br>O'Reilly (the publisher of so many excellent technical books) publishes many books on Open Source systems and software.  For example, their series of books on the Perl programming language includes titles such as:<br>* Learning Perl - beginning code and exercises to learn main concepts<br>* Programming Perl - their main reference book on the language<br>* Perl Cookbook - example programs of all shapes and sizes<br>* Perl Best Practices<br>* Mastering Perl<br>* Perl Hacks<br><br>I'm imaging a parallel approach -- the basic AF methodology is free (and already available at this website).  But then you could create and sell an ebook, maybe 20-30 pages, called "Learning Autofocus", where you provide the system, but with a bit more explanation and a few more examples.  I see ebooks all the time like this, selling for about $10 US.  E.g., <a href="http://www.takecontrolbooks.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.takecontrolbooks.com/</a><br><br>An "Autofocus Cookbook" could have the kind of material that CatherineCS describes in her post:  examples of how Autofocus could be applied in many different life and work situations.  Each chapter could be a "day in the life of ...", and then tell the story of how a particular kind of person has found Autofocus to be useful.<br><br>Mark wouldn't even need to write all these himself.  He could start a free, open Wiki, where all kinds of people could contribute their examples.  (E.g., <a href="http://pbwiki.com/)." rel="nofollow">http://pbwiki.com/).</a>  Mark could then assemble the most interesting / illustrative examples into a book (ebook or traditional book), of which he would be the editor-in-chief.  <br><br>(Mark, I'd be happy to start a Wiki like that, if you want -- we could link to it from the Yahoo Group that Mel started.)<br><br>The other Perl book titles suggest their own Autofocus parallels.  <br><br>Even the Perl.org website suggests a possible Autofocus parallel.<br><br>FWIW, YMMV, etc.</div>

<div class="content">I would start by putting a Donation button on this page. The other thing is I would look at how David Allen and others have turned their systems into great business ventures. The thing with GTD is that it's a bit like reading a philosopher who makes just enough sense that you think that if you just buy this book or the cd you will get the rest. It has an elusive quality that lends itself to further marketing opportunities. But I would take a look at how these folks manage to take a rather simple concept and turn it in to an empire. I personally think your system works, and his doesn't, at least for me. Although I did learn a lot from what didn't work in GTD, and I learned about breaking tasks up into actionable items and so on.

Maybe different project tasks can be colour coded in the AF list.<br><br>I like to weekly plan at a goal / project level and then drop the tasks into an AF list but I am never certain if the task is allready in the list.

<div class="content">If you do write a book Mark, I wish you would add some of your input on how to Autofocus "life goals."  Put in a section about how to use AF to identify these life goals and then use AF to filter them out.  It's kind of adding a top-down approach where I think AF can be bottom up - but in the hands of the right person, I think it would be a good tool.  <br><br>I identified my top goals for the year on Jan. 1 and one of them was "follow Mark Forster's new time management approach" (thinking I'd give it a 30 day trial and if it didn't work, keep going on my search for something that did.)  Thank God you came out with it on Jan. 5 because I didn't get anything at all done between Jan. 1-5.  So for me, it's been working to help me accomplish my other 8 goals because I keep putting in tasks that move them forward.   One goal I just entirely dismissed because I kept not feeling like doing the tasks related to it on the list.  It was a relief to get rid of it.<br><br>I haven't figured out yet how to get it to help me go on a diet though, although I have thought of putting "eat a new vegetable" on the list. :-)<br></div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline<br><br>A simple AF tip for dieting - add a task to "lose 1lb".  You can either add it periodically e.g once every two or three pages, or every page is you wish, or just readd each time completed.  Each time you lose a 1lb you can cross it off.  If it becomes the last item on the page and it is not achieved you can just dismiss it - and readd it if and when appropriate.  No detail needed, no pressure.  And you can just do it from your last weight, eg if you happen to put on a few pounds just treat each "lose 1 lb" as from your last weigh in.</div>

<div class="content">In my opinion, the great thing about AF is its simplicity.  If you made it into a book, you would need more pages which would likely require more intricacies.  I love the idea of an e-book as you could keep that shorter. Since the momentum around this is mostly internet based there is also a nice symbiosis with that.   I saw another idea about an AF Branded notebook with simple instructions at the beginning, also a great idea.  I do think that you should try and make money from this great idea as you deserve it.</div>

I think that a book with pictures/ illustrations of a dummy AF list working through all the steps ... just like the video shows ... would be great.  I think the video was more comprehensible than the instructions ... my a mile ... at least ;-)<br><br>You could get the same effect by writing the "rules" in a more chatty, descriptive style (as the video does) and where you point to your list, show an illustration of a dummy page.  Make up actually pages with page numbers, high lights, cross offs, Xs for completed pages, etc.  It sure would have saved me some head scratching.  ;-)</div>

<div class="content">These are all great ideas - so many so fast! I think the first thing is to for Mark to trademark "AutoFocus" if that is still possible. Donations are also an excellent start. I can visualize an AutoFocus web application based on the model of say "Nozbe" or "Don't Forget the Milk". The advantage is that you have a targeted group of users willing to pay for various levels of service. The free access would be a basic list with perhaps some basic instructions. The "Premium" (paid) access would include more detailed instructions, examples of use, an active user forum and perhaps ongoing live participation from Mark along with discounts on purchases that Mark recommends/uses. Another benefit of this approach is it's availability: mobile phones, computers at work, PDA's, public computers with internet access, etc. Once this web app is established the opportunities will multiply in unexpected ways: a sort of "critical mass" of diverse AutoFocus users!</div>

<div class="content">I believe that if you are going to write a (rather small) book as a kind of compressed version of all the discussed points here in this forum, just your answers to all sorts of questions that came up about the AF system, that would be an interesting one - for two reasons:<br><br>1. At least I like to read your precise and concise answers to questions. How they come straight to the point. How helpful they are. And from my experience, if I like how somebody writes, a lot of people do as well :-)<br><br>2. The AF system being free is no hindrance to this, but rather publicity. Someone may come to this website, read the instructions, the forum etc. and maybe think "Hey, that's worth a try". He or she tries it out, finds it's working like magic, even better than expected - it's only natural to desire to know all that is to know about that system. If one is adopting a task management system: This is something very central for your life. It's absolutely no question to spend some money on it in order to understand it as fully as possible.<br><br>For example, take GTD. It's no problem to find out how this thing works. The system is explained in Wikipedia, on a -zillion websites... You can easily collect everything you need to know to start it.<br><br>But - I bought Allens book nevertheless.

That's no money for an important part of one's life.<br><br><br>BTW, I'd like to argue AGAINST a donation button. Asking for donations is selling oneself under value.

<div class="content">A couple of points:<br><br>- Putting a donation button allows people to contribute what they can ... and in these times that is a consideration.<br><br>- In my personal experience when people have donated to me, they have given me far more than I would have asked for.<br><br>- Asking for a payment of what something is worth, is a far more "fair" way to approach things, IMO.  If you are offering something of great value, that should be recognized, and probably will be.  If what you are offering does not get much in the way of payment, then maybe the value is not there.  At least that is the way I see things.<br><br>- I don't find donations tacky at all.  It tells me that the person would like to be paid but does not want the overhead of running a business and so is trading that off and simply accepting donations which, if less than he might get from running a business with a payment system, may pay off more because he can focus on what is important to him and not incur overhead.<br><br>IMO, it comes down to where the interest lies.  Running a consulting business, giving courses, writing books ... those are all different things that speak to different desires and probably different personalities.  There are lots of ways to make money but not so many that "feel right".</div>

Each article is "how to get your life organized in 10 minutes" or whatever, using autofocus, and tailored to the magazine's readership.

<div class="content">- here in the US/Canada, there are loads of multi-speaker events who have speakers like Jim Rohn, Zig Ziglar types but also more practical speakers like your message on time mgmt.  You don't have to do the work of setting everything up then.<br>- Harv Eker (Millionaire Mind) in his Warrior Camps etc. has other guests in to present their programs - about 3-4 hours - he also brands and does back of the room sales of other people's material (hypnotherapy, etc.), also has T-shirt sales etc. ("Just Frickin' Do It!" is the one I own - always a good conversation starter.) :-)  Tony Robbins has guest speakers as well.  Also about 10-12 years ago, I belonged to a monthly coaching group of Harv's - I think the cost was ~$150/mo. and there were about 80-100 people registered in 5 cities across Western Canada.<br>- I liked the review Trent from The Simple Dollar did on your GED / DIT, I think he's a GTD-er as is Leo from Zen Habits, they have a pretty big base and are supposed to be all about simplicity, which AF is.<br>- Tim Ferriss (the 4 Hour Workweek) would be an awesome ambassador and I think your concepts mesh well with his philosophy<br>- work with the people from 43 Things, there's a lot of people who set goals on there, but don't follow through<br>- Brazen Careerist - can present a practical approach to actually succeeding in a career using AF/other time management ideas<br>- I think if you could co-author a book with Paul McKenna, it would be sensational - "I Can Make You Do Things" :-) or "I Can Make You Reach Your Goals".  And I'd love to see a TV program based on it as well.<br>- can you get on one of those home improvement shows - I'm thinking of the ones where people renovate a house (eg. The Property Ladder) but you can tell a lot of them have no project management aptitude and have a very scattered approach, get unmotivated in the process - they need a coach for those times.  Same thing with some of the cleaning kinds of TV shows where these strange women come in to houses that are filthy and get them to clean it, those people need a system/coach to keep it going<br>- The "No Diet Diet" people are UK based and they have a system of changing habits based on choosing daily actions which are outside of your comfort zones which would work perfectly with AF<br>- re. e-Book(s), I think it's a great idea and can be geared towards various concerns people have <br>- I personally find a "donation" button kind of cheesy - I recall that Steve Pavlina had it on his site and I found it off-putting, but having a Paypal link wouldn't be<br>- can you get booked on a weekend lineup of self-help authors such as Hay House?  You probably have to be published with them.  <br>- What about a radio show on the Hay House internet network?  Again, have to have published with them, but you probably have a contact there with Michael Neill.  I think some people have shows on there prior to publishing though.<br>- Flylady has a radio show on an internet network as well<br>- co-author with Jack Canfield (Chicken Soup) - I don't recall that he's done anything with time management<br>- add a re-engineering aspect and market to corporations - with the economy the way it is, we're all having to do more with less and with major layoffs to boot<br>- affiliate with personal development training companies<br>- I'd like to see you dump John Kremer's "1001 Ways to Market Your Books" into AF and see what comes out of it. :-)<br><br>It's hard to be more specific - like you said in one of your books, if someone said figure out a way to make a car work better, you'd be hard pressed to do it, but ask them to figure out how to improve their steering wheel and they can come up with answers.  I think the question needs to be more specific to find out things that are more suited towards you and your goals - eg. if you don't want to have to travel, do want to write another book, don't want to be a coaching type of person, do want to be on TV.  That's JMHO.<br></div>

<div class="content">The two people whose 'self-help' books I have found to be most powerful are Paul McKenna and Mark Forster. I second Jacqueline's suggestion and I want that collaboration SOON!<br><br>One of the affirmations Paul McKenna routinely uses in his hypnosis CDs is "You're getting more done". It's mentioned in passing but he never develops exactly how you're meant to "get more done". Autofocus is the 'missing link'.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hey little b, I also love Paul McKenna's hypnosis CD's - when I remember to play them, I enjoy falling to sleep with them or even listening to one I have on mp3 when I'm at work - and wish he would come up with something related to time management (with Mark, of course).  I can almost hear it now - "you are joyfully doing every task that stands out", "you find it easy to accomplish everything you set your mind to", "you always know the task that's ready to be done", "you are an achiever", "when faced with distractions, you easily come back into focus" ...  lol  <br>Come to think of it, Mark doesn't need PM himself, just a good hypnotist to work with to get a CD out - I really like Marshall Sylver's hypnosis too, and Neil Fiore is a hypno guy as well. I just really looooove PM's voice and his scripts are great.<br>I'll have to put a note in my book to listen to PM more often because I always feel great about myself when I do. :-)<br><br>Could Mark do some collaboration with one of the coaching federations/associations - similar to Thomas Leonard - where he didn't coach anymore (before he died, that is) but did provide programs for the ICF I think.  I met him once at a speaking event, very different kind of guy, but his concept of eliminating *Tolerations* would mesh nicely with an AF approach to doing so.<br></div>

We need some active discussions on the popular boards with direct comparisons against other popular systems.  We need user contributed success stories, dedicated AF discussion groups, there needs to be a sense of community for the AF users. The whole focus to my mind needs to be on building the user base but also building the community.  Once AF is the most popular system around, then I would imagine people will approach you with revenue generating ideas.  <br><br>Perhaps even part of the hook could be that it is free and will remain free - available to anybody.

<div class="meta">2009-08-5 12:48</div>
<div class="content">Just my two cents to add up to all the ideas already available in this thread:<br><br>Some basics first:<br>1. You started AutoFocus as some kind of Open Source product (although it isn’t software). <br>2. You’re retired, so time is value in another way than it is when you’re willing to work 80 hours a week. Which doesn’t mean you don’t want to work 80 hours a week, but what does change the way you’re working in a sense that you want to be able to ‘leaf’ work whenever you want, for any giving period of time.  <br>3. People are getting used to information that’s free on the internet and most of the time don’t realise this information has some value<br>4. The web is full with data, it’s the challenge to convert it to useful information<br>5. We humans like to be part of a group and are willing to share with other group members<br>6. People are lazy<br>7. If there’s ‘nothing in it for me’ people will leave groups really easy on the internet<br><br>Linking the above to my experiences with Open Source Software and Online Communities and the Information Society we’re living in these days I want to add some thoughts to the discussion:<br><br>1:<br>Open Source comes in many ways. After ten years of working with Open Source software I find that the most successful software is al organised the same way. There’s always a team of core developers. These developers protect the core code and do make final decisions about what’s getting into core and what isn’t. Other people are always free to program their own modules to add to the software, but there is no guarantee for the users these modules will be available in any new version. Guarantees are only given about core. For stability reasons often there’s some association that holds the trademark.<br><br>I feel Mark is like the core developer, Revised AutoFocus is like the core code and on this forum lots of people are talking about some extra modules added to core. Sometimes a module is this good, Mark will add it to core.<br><br>2:<br>Getting a trademark, setting up some kind of association would be a good idea maybe.<br>Opportunities are endless, but Mark isn’t looking for tons of work. Developing software for example for the iPhone can be done, but costs lots of time to develop and to maintain. Within the Open Source world there should be people within the community who are willing to give their time in exchange for some free publicity (like a link to their website in a colophon or something) or something.<br>For Mark himself I think doing what he’s good at is the best way to go. So, yes, write stuff down in an e-book and yes give interviews and publish them as audio-books or podcasts.<br><br>3:<br>Newspapers are suffering, the same goes for the Music Industry or the Movies. Everything on the internet is free or seems to be free or is easier to get for free than to pay for it. <br><br>4:<br>More and more I get the feeling that surviving comes in two ways: make it easier to get something for money than to get it for free (think about iTunes. Lot’s of people do switch from downloading music with torrent clients etc. because it’s way more easy to find a song on iTunes and put it on your iPod these days) or add value to it (again like iTunes and Genius: when you buy a song on iTunes, iTunes will tell you what other songs you would probably like.  Apple can give me this information, because they know what other people are buying and will convert all this data into some smart way, to add value for the customer). <br><br>5:<br>People want to be part of a team. You can give them an extra feeling of being part of the team if the team has it’s own characterization. So do ask the community to come up with a unique AutoFocus Logo and yes, do publish this logo on pens, notebooks etc.<br><br>We only want to team up with people we do have some kind of connection with. This makes each community interesting for advertisement. We are a target group for publishers like Moleskine, so I suppose they’re willing to pay for only advertisement, audio ads at the start of a podcast etc.<br><br>6:<br>People are lazy. So converting all the data from the community to some useful information is what people are willing to pay for. Look for example to the books Chris Anderson is publishing (www.longtail.com). Free as an e-book or audio book, paying for the paper edition (don’t forget to read the book ‘Free’ or/ and  ‘The Long tail’). Although Anderson is giving his books for free, you can imaging that the e-book or audio-book would be something people are willing to pay for. <br><br>Again, people are lazy. There’s tons of information at these forums. If you’ve read it all, you can extract the interesting parts of it and convert data into useful information. People are lazy, so converting text into audio or video is always a great way to communicate. I think about the little video interview on AutoFocus 1. That’s a little video people do want to pay for. Do a summary for free on youtube, make a extended edition for a few dollars.<br><br>People are lazy. So a donation button will work for the first few days and will trigger early adaptors to give you some money, but it’s easy to overlook. You add value to threads on the forum, but a small donation button in a signature or something at the bottom of bigger contributions from yourself to pay a little any easy way (paypal or something).<br><br>7:<br>Keep listening to the community.  Although people can arrange their own groups at yahoogroups, linkedIn etc., people can host their own wiki’s etc., it’s important that the same people keep coming to your website, so find ways to work together with all these interesting initiatives. Maybe the initiator of the wiki for example is willing to convert it to your own domain to make it part of the growing “AutoFocus web”. Same goes for the question ages ago about some kind of RSS feed or something for the forum messages (again: people are lazy). Maybe there is someone in the community willing to give you some coding hours for free to add it to your site.<br><br>Well, I can keep on going for hours. We could do an IRC session or maybe even Skype/ audio chat with some people to brainstorm some more?</div>

The A5 is too big and heavy, and the standard can't cope with a day-to-page diary format if you want other paper in there. AAAAARRRRGGGGHHHH]</div>

<div class="content">Little B,<br><br>You didn't mention price: you could splash out on an X47. (Their daily diary inserts each cover 2 months. <a href="http://www.x47.com/en/produkte/mabook/produkt.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.x47.com/en/produkte/mabook/produkt.html</a></div>

<div class="content">David Allen is selling a poster of the GTD process for $49.  It comes with a 35-minute DVD explaining the poster.<br><br>https://secure.davidco.com/store/catalog/GTD-Workflow-Map-with-Coaching-DVD-NEW-p-16554.php<br><br>Maybe Mark could take one of the AF flowcharts and pretty it up, and then add a 10-minute video to show how it works.  And charge less.  More effective method, simpler flowchart, simpler to explain, and lower cost.  Hard to beat that!</div>

<div class="content">I might have mentioned it before: Even if I get the complete explanation of the system for free, I would buy "The Book" that would explain everything in detail, discuss all conceivable special cases and problems and possible solutions etc. - and I guess a lot of people would do so. You base your life upon a task management system! Compared to that, 20€ or the like for such a book is nothing. Especially if it's written by the creator of said system.<br><br>This way, the free publication of the system would work as publicity for the book and enhance its sales, not diminish them.<br><br>This happened to me with GTD. When I was studying GTD, I found everything I'd needed to know about how GTD works for free online somewhere on websites, written by GTD enthusiasts. At first I thought, "he he, no need to spend money on this guy's book", but the more I got serious, the less I felt so, and when I came across the book "Getting Things Done", I bought it without hesitation. There's nothing like the original voice, and I didn't regret it.<br><br>And just scanning the discussions here in this forum will deliver more material than a book can hold.<br><br>So, in short, my 2 cents: The best way will be to write "The Autofocus Book".</div>

<div class="content">I also agree, but I would add that if Mark should choose to write another book, that he get a better publisher who would promote the book in the United States. After easily being able to buy "Get Everything Done..." here in the US via Amazon, I was surprised that I had to wait six weeks for my copy of "Do It Tomorrow" to arrive from the UK. Indeed, the lack of publicity and availability of that book here, a huge market for self-help and time-management books, is absolutely scandalous.  I would hate to see the same neglect for an Autofocus book.</div>

<div class="content">I would buy the book even if it wouldn't provide more information that can be found here.<br><br>Not only as a sign of appreciation (which I certainly feel), but to incentive the growth of the system.</div>

<div class="content">In that case, Mark should register www.superfocus.me asap. It is still available. ($9/y at Godaddy.com). I'm actually quite serious. Seems like a pretty good domain name, even with the .me extension since you can regard superfocus as a verb.<br><br>"SuperFocus yourself with the all-new task management paradigm by Mark Forster at www.superfocus.me!"<br><br>T-shirt with:<br><br>"TO DO LIST<br>walk dogs<br>get groceries<br>clean damn dishes<br>dreaded tax returns<br>...start procrastinating<br><br>www.superfocus.me"<br><br>I'd probably buy one :P.</div>

<div class="content">A ton of good suggestions here. <br><br>I would just like to add: If you are thinking of something like a book, you might want to investigate rockethub or indieagogo, both of which provide a ransom model for creative tasks, so that people can pay you in advance for the book, while its still in production. I would definitely contribute to such a project.<br><br>Like a lot of people here, I would love a software solution for implementing SF v3. I am actually planning on writing one myself, in initially for the BlackBerry (since I am getting one in a couple of days), but I will probably expand it to web and desktop, and possibly iPhone and Android. If Mark (or anybody else for that matter) would like to give some suggestions for that project, feel free to email me on plosiguant [at] gmail [dot] com (I already have a ton of ideas, currently trying to figure out what to put into version 1). If Mark wants to, I would be very happy to split any of the profits with him.<br><br>I would also be interested in some sort of Autofocus seminar, as well as some sort of coaching training.<br><br>As for the branded stationery, I would happily buy some if I ever saw it in a shop, but I am pretty unlikely to order it.<br><br>In other words, I think all the ideas given here are good!</div>

<div class="content">How randomly I come across this post...<br>Mark - on reading your Dreams book & later your passion for experimenting.. wondering if you would be interested to train others/ coach the coaches in your Various methodologies and techniques and tools... Of course, in your own style...<br><br>There are quite a many unwarranted courses on the internet, which claim more than they are worth...<br><br>On the contrary, you might want to start an Productivity/ Time management video courses.. <br><br>There would be an upfront investment of resources, but otherwise it would truly be a passive or at least light touch way of earning...<br><br>Importantly I believe it may carry your legacy forward...</div>
