<div class="content">AF has become a game of sorts. It's the one system that I both and enjoy AND tricks me into doing things I deem too complex. However... I'm concerned that, in time (as the honeymoon with AF wanes), I'm going to lapse back into my "do whatever I want to do" mode of productivity. And this usually happens when I have 1-2 breaks throughout my day (vs an entire open day to do stuff). How do you use AF on a daily basis? Do you schedule it into your planner? Do you hit the notebook as soon as you wake up? Personally, if I don't hit the notebook first thing, I'm off into "do whatever you want to do" la la land, and the result ain't pretty. <br><br>Any ideas/suggestions?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Avrum<br><br><<Do you hit the notebook as soon as you wake up? Personally, if I don't hit the notebook first thing, I'm off into "do whatever you want to do" la la land, and the result ain't pretty. >><br><br>My aim is to hit my notebook first thing for the very reason you describe.  I have been using AF since Day 1 of Beta Testing (Jan 5) and the novelty has not worn off.  I have never used a system so consistently before and I guess it has been used long enough now for it to be an established habit. Consequently, because it's ability is tried and tested I intend to use it consistently and I think that intent is an important factor in ensuring ongoing use.<br><br>For a number of reasons there have been days when working through my notebook has been difficult if not impossible but there are two specific things that keep me on track.  Firstly, regardless of time availability to work the list, ensure that you continue to write your tasks onto the list, even if that is by jotting down tasks in a temporary location and adding later.  Secondly, I find that the fact that I keep daily statistics keeps me on track. I have maintained a spreadsheet for this since 23 February. I have a final column in my AF spreadsheet which shows whether the number of active items has increased or decreased that day, and automatically changes colour accordingly.  The "game" is to have as few pink (increased) cells as possible and maintain unbroken runs of green (decreased) cells.<br><br>Having had a frustrating few weeks where I "feel" as though I have achieved very little (and previously would have become demoralised) my statistics instantly show that my numbers of active items are actually decreasing pretty consistently.  By ensuring everything goes into the list, when I do have time to work the lists properly, there are always items that will have been completed in those "off list" periods.  Without that evidence I would believe wrongly that I was not getting things done, purely because it didn't "feel" like it!<br><br>Hope that helps!<br></div>

<div class="content">Wow Christine. So, so helpful. I'm still not sure how to use AF on days where I have a few 1-2 hour gaps, here and there. However, as a solopreneur, I often have 3-4 hour gaps, and that's where AF shines. I will use AF whenever I have a gap for 2+ hours. <br><br>Your daily stats procedure sounds interesting. Alas, I'm using paper and won't commit to entering completed tasks... particularly in the long run.</div>

<div class="content">This is an important issue and one I still struggle with somewhat.  I have so many days that are wall-to-wall meetings that I may not have a lot of time to consult my AF lists.  I find myself doing as the AF instructions state that if something needs to be done, use your common sense and do it.  My problem is I tend to stay in this mode and just continue working on multiple things without pausing to work off of my AF lists.  It is a concern that I have.<br><br>Any suggestions?<br><br>Best wishes,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Oh, and by the way...telling me to "just work off of the AF lists -- it is that simple"...won't help.  I guess the problem I am experiencing is balancing between Mark's instructions in AF of just using one's common sense and doing what needs to be done and working through the AF lists.  I could argue that I could work in the former mode quite a while, but I do realize that there needs to be a transition from that mode to working off of the AF lists.  There is an inherent danger in working in only "what needs to be done mode" in that one tends to work on only what appears at the moment and seems important and on other colleagues' priorities.<br><br>Mark and others -- please provide advice.<br><br>Thanks -- and best wishes,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">I think some mentally preplanning comes into play here. Before starting on a 'must-do-now' item pause for a moment how you will continue your work after the task is done. If all you do is visually picture getting back to your AF list after the task is complete, it's much more likely you'll get back in AF afterward. If this becomes a habit it's easier to switch back to AF on a regular basis even if urgent tasks frequently interrupt. <br><br>Another trick might be to highlight a task from your AF list that you at least have the intention of doing right after you've handled the more urgent item, prior to starting this urgent item. <br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Peter,<br><br>Thanks -- this is very good advice and helpful.  I know it sounds like it should be so easy to not stay in the "if it needs to be done, just do it" mode.  But there are some days and weeks in my work with so many inputs that I find it all too easy to do so.  Of course, I AM being productive and getting things done that need to be done, but I do need to get back to my AF lists in a more consistent manner.<br><br>I will take your advice and see how things go.<br><br>Best wishes,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Hi Avrum<br><br>One of the things I have found is that you can use AF in almost any size gap - even the odd 5 or 10 minute ones.  I think for me the key to using it in small gaps is in the way I define my tasks.  For example, a selection of items on my current page includes: Check Email, Check schedule, Coffee, Scanning, Update xyz Spreadsheet, Call abc, Locate xxx file, Email to zzz, yyy called back?, Buy flowers for xyz, Stack/Unstack dishwasher, Tidy kitchen.  If I have a spare half hour say, I can make a cup of coffee, stack/unstack the dishwasher and start tidying the kitchen in the process, sit down with my coffee and call abc, and perhaps check my email.  Or I may spend the half hour updating my spreadsheet.  Or I may move on to the next page ..... Other project type tasks tend to stand out when I have larger blocks of time.<br><br>Being home based means that my list is always to hand, as is my computer and the tools I need to action most tasks.<br><br>Also I ensure I am always aware of my current "essential" tasks (genuinely essential) and have a pretty clear picture of what is in my lists through regular reviews.  If I have a 10 minute gap I may just spend it reviewing my lists.<br><br>The stats spreadsheet takes minutes to update daily.  I primarily use paper for AF - digital solutions just did not work for me (although I do also use OneNote as detailed elsewhere). It took a short time to set up but all I do is, when moving on from a page, update the no of o/s items for that page on the spreadsheet (10 seconds?) and it is set up to give a running total of o/s items.  At the end of the day all I have to do is enter (1) the number of items I have added to the list that day and (2) pick up the running total figure.  Takes about 2 minutes.<br><br>If you like I can send you a copy of my stats spreadsheet which would be easy enough to amend for your own figures.  If you would like a copy then please feel free to email me at mail(AT)meovoto.co.uk<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi David<br><br>Even if "just work off the AF lists" is the solution it seems to me that the question is not "how do I get stuff done" but rather "how do I work effectively with AF with sporadic small bursts of discretionery time and a lot of genuinely urgent "do now" type items?".<br><br>It seems from earlier posts that you are finding AF really effective now in getting things done so firstly keep doing what works.  Secondly try to create some AF habits, such as making sure you enter everything onto your lists and keeping your AF book to hand so it is easier to work from than anything else. As mentioned above I find keeping statistics helpful also.<br><br>Peter's idea is an excellent one - creating that picture of getting back to your list.<br><br>For me though the key is to write everything, particularly interruptions, down on the list, and in the scenario where it becomes a "do it now" item, to switch to working on the current page as I "do it now".  That keeps me in AF and when you stop working on that item you are naturally set up to scan the page for the next "standing out" item.  If whilst working on that item, six more colleague requests come in, just add them as they arise, and then again they will be on your page to action or not as appropriate.  At present I am working almost exclusively in tandem mode - and am amazed at how my overall number of items is reducing, and how many older items I am still clearing.<br><br>So, if the answer is "work off the AF lists" then the key is to ensure that you have the "do it now" item on the list with the ability to work on it!  <br><br>Hope that helps David - and hope you are still looking to take some breaks occasionally. :-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine,<br><br>Thanks -- your advice, as usual, is outstanding.  Yes, AF IS working for me and I do want to make that clear to everyone -- I did not mean to say it was not.  I just need to make some adjustments so I don't stay too long in "do it now" mode.  I am using your tweak, Christine and I am finding it very helpful.  <br><br>As for time to rest -- yes, I have done so and will continue to take some breaks.  I do need to recharge the batteries on occasion!<br><br>Best wishes,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Avrum, have you got any goals that you really want to see achieved broken down on your AF list?  If I didn't have that, I would probably have a hard time sticking with returning to my notebook.  <br><br>I keep track of my stats on paper - not the numbers of completed items as that would require way too much counting, but number of active pages.  That's motivating (as well as seeing the completed projects) as I'm up to almost 50 completed pages now and try to keep the number of active pages down to around 15 or less - and I don't put much fluff on my list.<br><br>I think you should expect that the novelty will wear off, and your enthusiasm will wax and wane as time goes by.  Mine certainly has, but the enthusiasm has always returned because it's the best way I know of to get things done at a realistic pace.  <br><br>Sometimes it still surprises me exactly how much progress can be made with those few 5 or 10 minute jobs here and there.  So when you have those 1 hour gaps, you could do a couple of things on your list and then do whatever you want for the rest of the time.  I do that on my lunch breaks a lot.</div>
