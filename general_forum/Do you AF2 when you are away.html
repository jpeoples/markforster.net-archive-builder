<div class="content">I can't see this problem answered anywhere else but will someone please tell me if it has been?  I was forging ahead very nicely with AF2 but now it's academic conference season and I'm on my 2nd week out of 3 conferencing.  I'm away from home and many of my tasks just can't be actioned here.  If I carry on AFing, I'll have everything dismissed by the end of the conferences.  And just the same would apply if you go on holiday.<br><br>So do you AF2 when you are away? Put the whole thing on hold - but I'm not on holiday and would like to continue to do some items on the list?<br><br>If I keep to the rules and have everything dismissed by the time I'm back to normal, that might give a good opportunity to make the first new item 'read through dismissed items' and reinstate what seems to be still good to do. But that doesn't seem to be exactly what Mark envisaged.  I'd be grateful for any thoughts.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Lesley, <br><br>I started AF2 using my active AF1 list on the day AF2 came out and coincidentally went on holiday that day as well.   <br><br>Prior to leaving, I went through my list and marked all of the items I could do while I was away and made sure that I had the proper tools / paper / books / files etc. with me on the trip.  I didn't dismiss according to the rules on things I couldn't have actioned where I was, just on things I didn't action because I chose not to.  I think I only dismissed two or three items in the 9 days.<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Leslie<br>RogerJ's post eloquently describes his use of AF in third world nations where there is no internet, formidable amounts of flight travel, etc.  He describes what he brings with him, how he plans ahead of time for opportunies to do different tasks, etc..... It's quite an impressive testimony to the effectiveness of AFwhen  placed in capable hands!<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/840117" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/840117</a><br><br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Leslie:<br><br>My recommended solution is that you keep a separate list for travelling.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks everyone.  Very useful, I'll give a special contextual list a try.  Luckily I'm not as peripatetic as RogerJ.</div>

<div class="content">Lesley,<br><br>Not sure if I like being tagged as peripatetic after I confirmed the meaning!  I do try to make my emails readable, even entertaining, but maybe I can't please all the people all the time or any of the time.  There's possibly a lesson for me  somewhere here.</div>

<div class="content">RogerJ:<br><br>What on earth was the definition you looked at? In the sense Leslie used it it means "constantly on the move". Nothing very objectionable about that!</div>

<div class="content">Oops, no offence meant RogerJ.  I did indeed mean 'constantly on the move' but additionally 'for your work' - like peripatetic music teachers who travel from school to school to teach their pupils.  I was trying to be complimentary - your life sounds very complex and you're so organised.</div>

<div class="content">Lesley and Mark,<br><br>Oops x 2!  My fault, I quickly typed "define: peripatetic" in Google and read the first response which was:<br><br>"Definition of unaccountable, peripatetic, wearisome, gregarious, visual, madonna, overtone, objective, off, staid"<br><br>I failed to see peripatetic in the body of the text and my eyes picked out "wearisome" and  "staid", so the confusion is all mine, apologies all round.  I'm no madonna either, especially at my age and with two grand-daughters who might well be one day.<br><br>Yes, my life seems complex, but I am not as organised in some facets of my life as i would like to be.  I once described myself to a friend as "Jack of all trades, master of none" and that I saw this as a weakness.  "Not so", said my friend, thank goodness.</div>

<div class="content">"Teacher" is a surprisingly good example: the alternative meaning of peripatetic is a follower of Aristotle, who famously walked around as he taught.</div>

<div class="content">I just got back from a  trip, and did as Mark suggests in keeping a separate list for the trip. Now that I'm back, I'll probably have at least two pages of items to add my list when I go through all my notes, business cards collected, follow-up needed, etc. I'm wondering how to keep my list from getting longer every time I travel.</div>

<div class="content">Margaret:<br><br><< I'm wondering how to keep my list from getting longer every time I travel. >><br><br>I don't think you can - assuming it's business trips you are concerned about. The whole point of a business trip is to get new work, isn't it?<br><br>The important thing is to leave sufficient time before your next trip to action all the stuff coming out of the previous trip.</div>
