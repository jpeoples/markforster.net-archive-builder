<div class="content">Before I even knew Mark was planning to do a demo day I grabbed screen shots of one trip through my list on Toodledo.  I'm working on turning those into a video and PDF file in the same way that I did for DWM last year (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4nEiJvNl-0)" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4nEiJvNl-0)</a> but it'll be a while before I have it ready for public consumption.</div>

<div class="content">I'd be one of those interested to view that PDF demo file of SFv3 on Toodledo, Sarah. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Just an update on this... I initially was working with screen shots of my toodledo list but the formatting was a pain... then I did screencasts but they were too big and unweidly. So today I decided to abandon the toodledo element of the demo and am working off of just a digital list. Which means that the demo should be up sometime tonight or tomorrow.</div>

<div class="content">Aaaaand it's done!<br><br>PDF located at <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8227179/SFv3.pdf" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8227179/SFv3.pdf</a> ; I recommend viewing it such that you can see a page at a time and flip pages.  If there's interest I can make a video version, too.</div>

<div class="content">Congratulation Sarah that's a nice job ! . I would be interested about a video with todledoo.<br>Do you link your tasks to projects in todledo or do you use evernote for all ?</div>

<div class="content">That was great Sarah!!   It really does a great job illustrating how one cycles through the pages.<br><br>It would have been even better if you had dismissed something.  :-)<br><br>And I think you must be very fast at embroidery.  :-)</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the corrected link Alan, I didn't catch that!<br><br>Jupiter, let me think about how I could do a Toodledo demo... doing a demo of this scale with screencasts was prohibitively huge (the Keynote document was over 2 GB).  I do not do any project list management on Toodledo - just the task stuff.  I use Evernote for most everything except my dissertation, for which I use a similar (no longer developed or supported) app called Journler.<br><br>Seraphim, in the normal flow of things, I dismiss relatively infrequently.  I actually actively thought about dismissing the second page (with the cat litter bin task) but I wanted to get the task taken care of more than I wanted a dismissal in the demo.  :^)  And I'm not that fast at embroidery, I just work on it in little bits and pieces of time, so each re-entry there represents maybe 5 minutes of stitching.  (I also only embroider pieces small enough to hold in my hand and carry with me for those times when I do have 5 empty minutes to fill.)</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Sarah. I just viewed  your demo.<br><br>I like the way one of your tasks spawned several "abstract xyz" tasks into C1 at the end of the list. I keep forgetting to do this, reverting instead to a "single next action" mentality. My list tends to have only a single next-action for each project, even when there are several ways I could move the project forward, some more appealing than others. Naturally, this slows my progress.<br><br>Maybe I should write in C1: "write several options for each project."</div>

<div class="content">Thank you for taking the time to put together a tool which deepens and offers me new insight into working the rules of SuperFocus.</div>

<div class="content">Excellent, Sarah, some hints there for all of us.<br><br>I liked the inclusion of using Evernote for project task tracking as i have been doing something similar.  However, i am considering moving to Evernote as I can synch it with other devices - eg Samsung Galaxy Tablet - and to my smartphone when I Probably move to an Android smartphone later this year.<br><br>I hope you have now mended the shirts and that KP returned your call!</div>

<div class="meta">2011-03-19 18:41</div>
<div class="content">That was helpful. It made me realize that I don't always "cycle through" like I should. I tend to look at the whole page until something jumps out at me. I will make a renewed effort to follow that rule more closely. Thanks for the demo! <br><br>(~the other Sarah)</div>

<div class="content">Roger, the shirt-mending ended up getting dismissed (mending often does) and I have, in fact, spoken to KP.  :^)<br><br>I tried SF with evernote because of the syncing capabilities - I set up tables very similar to what's in the demo but discovered to my disappointment that, at least on the iPad, you cannot edit rich text evernote documents so all I could do was read my list.  Thankfully the iPad Toodledo app is LOVELY (much better, in fact, than the web interface).</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Sarah! I finally got around to watching it. It is very interesting to see how someone else works things. <br><br>I tried to do various things in Evernote once upon a time. It never quite clicked for me. I'm interested enough to hear how others use it that I'll start a new thread. <br><br>And I was worried about the lunches. ;) <br><br>I'm very glad you put a time frame at the end. I'm guessing that it was a 'work-day into evening' 10 hour stretch?</div>

<div class="content">@Sarah,<br>I know you have written about your setup on Toodledo before. But, can you provide a bit more detailed account on how you have setup Toodledo (web as well as iPhone) - pages, sort criteria, strikethru+re-enter workflow, highlight for dismissal etc.? The mechanism I tried with Toodledo earlier was very tedious and I am sure I was missing something! Right now I am doing SF on paper but would like to take a look at electronic option if that's available. Thanks.<br><br>GC</div>

<div class="content">Malisa - Yeah, the time covered was approximately 11 am to 10 pm with an hour or so break in the middle.<br><br>Greenchutney - one of the things on my list *right now* is a short toodledo screencast.  I've done the screen grabs, I just need to compile and annotate them.</div>

<div class="content">Another vote for the Toodledo demo (even just an explanation!).<br><br>I've been very happy using paper for SF, but have found I wind up keeping a second list on my computer for all the things that come up while I'm working on my computer--and that makes me think I should be keeping the whole list on the computer!</div>

<div class="content">@Sarah: I'm experimenting using Evernote for SF3, I have one note, then a page break for each page and column, eg<br>Page 01.C1 Dismissed for review tasks<br>Page 02.C1  Open tasks: these are numbered up to a maximum of 20 tasks, then I start a new page.<br>Page 02.C2 Unfinished/urgent tasks: these are not numbered, each has a check-box<br>Page 03.C1 Open tasks<br>Page 03.C2 Unfinished/urgent tasks<br>and so on.<br><br>The current pages - C1 and C2 - have bold text headers.  Finished open tasks on C1 pages have a strike-through when done, C2 tasks get check box ticked.<br><br>There is a separate notebook for projects whose tasks I can pull across to the relevant C1 or C2 as necessary, or maybe not!  However, as someone has already mentioned, I could have the projects within the SF3 notebook, so I've dragged-and-dropped a project note into the SF3 notebook, works nicely.<br><br>I've also gone for Evernote (probably going to drop MS OneNote) as it is one of the few applications to include Windows Mobile 6.5, my current smartphone.  I will install and test this shortly, and also on my wife's Galaxy Tablet (Android).  I like the concept of having the information available on more than one device.<br><br>However, I am also intrigued by your use of Toodeldo which is not available for WM nor do I have an iPhone, but I may get an Android smartphone later this year.<br><br>I stopped using GTD and MLO some years ago (ok, when Mark started his first incarnation of AF in December 2008!) as I did not like the overhead.<br><br>Have you found any such 'overhead' using Toodledo as your main SF3 list? <br>How do your format pages and columns for SF3?<br><br>I guess all will be revealed in your upcoming demo!!</div>

<div class="content">For evernote users, there's a related iphone app called Egretlist. Personally, I can't see using it for SuperFocus, but the way it works is intriguing. It gathers the to-do items from within Evernote and lets you manipulate them in various way. I'd be curious to hear if anyone can make it work at all.</div>
