<div class="content">I've just written in SuperFocus (C1):<br><br>"Spend $75/month to drink one Monster every day, even though they don't really taste that good."<br><br>I'm wondering if that will work on my intuitive side to fight this silly addiction of mine to "Monster" sports drinks (luckily, the sugar-free kind).<br><br>Here's what I'm thinking: as I scan the list, (a) this item will serve as a periodic reminder, and (b) it will hopefully not stand out. Since I will see it while scanning, I'll be in a very receptive, intuitive mode, perhaps enhancing the message's effect.<br><br>Add to that the element of surprise, as I intend to add it to select pages at random, maybe 1/3 of my pages. It needs to be a novelty whenever I see it, or it will lose its impact. For extra novelty, perhaps I will word it differently each time. Also, I have used reverse psychology, framing it as a strikingly bad proposition. I am counting on my skeptical rebellious side to say, "Bah, I am *not* doing that!"<br><br>I haven't given much thought to this item's lifespan on the list, but I suppose dismissal would be a victory, or perhaps it will get "done" and crossed out.<br><br>We shall see. I will report back later. If you would like to try something similar, please share your experience here.<br><br>Thanks!</div>

<div class="content">Interesting idea but never tried that.  I'm doubtful it will work, but it's worth experimenting. Another approach is to fill your pages with actions that if followed will reduce your desire for the unhealthy substance. <br><br><br><br>For what it's worth:<br>- I can't stand coffee, but I like Monster. <br>- Monster is however toxic in the long run<br>- the caffiene is too high<br>- the acids and sucralose or sugar are bad<br>- unlike Colas, energy drinks taste okay defizzed, so you can taper down rather than quit<br>- exercise, sleep, vitamin B, fresh fruits and veggies help alertness apart from caffeine</div>

<div class="content">A couple of self-coaching questions next to it may help:<br><br>C1: How do I maintain the habit of drinking Monster?<br>C1: What are the benefits of the current behaviours?<br>C1: if there were a healthier way of getting the same benefits what might it be?</div>

<div class="content">Careful not to do that task, then count it as "something on the page is done -- turn the page". Although, if you only write it once per page, that will be self-limiting.</div>

<div class="content">Great idea, Bernie.  Back in the AF1 days, Mark frequently recommended this tactic to overcome addictive / compulsive behaviors, such as drinking soft drinks or coffee, or surfing the Internet, or smoking, or whatever.   Put them on the list and do them only when they stand out.   Many seemed to find it helpful -- it worked for me.<br><br>See here, for example:  <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/638216" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/638216</a></div>

<div class="content">Wow, an entire thread already existed on this sort of thing?<br>I guess there really are no new ideas under the sun ... except for AutoFocus.  ;-></div>

<div class="content">Bernie - <br><br>Here are a couple more:<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/747846" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/747846</a><br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1384080" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1384080</a><br><br><br>It was fun taking that jaunt down memory lane...  :-)</div>

<div class="content">Update:<br><br>Day 3, and I have not purchased or drunk a Monster (or Red Bull or anything like it ;).<br>Considering that I already did today's drive-out errands, it is unlikely to happen the rest of today.<br><br>Three days is not much, BUT consider that I was drinking 1-2 of these cans, about 2/3 of the days, and the probability of this happening by chance is only 4% (1/3 cubed), for a confidence level of 96%.<br><br>As published studies often accept a confidence level of 95%, I would say we are getting somewhere!</div>

<div class="content">Congratulations Bernie!   May the Monster never stand out and the Red Bull be forever dismissed!</div>

<div class="content">This has worked extremely well.<br>I went nine days energy-drink-free (confidence level: 0.005%), and it wasn't even difficult.<br><br>Now, since my goal was never to give them up completely—just to break the addiction and avoid spending ludicrous amounts of money on them—I have chosen to enjoy them on weekends only.<br><br>Last Sat., I bought two (special price!) and drank one Sat., one Sun. I've had no trouble avoiding them since and am looking forward to another brace of them this weekend.<br><br>In C1, waiting to be dismissed, still stands that original item: "Spend $75/month to drink one Monster every day, even though they don't really taste that good."<br><br>Funny thing is, now that I've stopped overdoing it, the ones I drank last weekend actually tasted good—it's a double win!</div>

<div class="content">Whoops! I mislabeled the number above.<br><br>0.005% is the probability of my Monster-less streak's having occurred by chance.<br>The confidence level is 99.995%.</div>

<div class="content">It's official: today, this task got dismissed!<br><br>Upon review, I reentered it and added two alternatives:<br>Spend $18/mo. to drink a Monster on Sat. and one on Sun.<br>Spend $9/mo. to drink a Monster every Sun. only.<br><br>Just glancing at them on my new page, the $9 entry has a very nice pull. I wonder what will happen this weekend!</div>
