<div class="content">Between different versions of AF and different paper and electronic implementations, I haven't stuck with anything long enough to get to page two. Well, I finally did and I suddenly got confused about dismissing things.<br><br>The "official" rules for dismissal start out with "If no tasks are done in Column 1 during a visit to a page,". Does that mean that I need to either work on or dismiss EVERYTHING on page 1-- in both columns-- before I can do anything on page 2?</div>

<div class="content">You always do everything in column 2.  If you do nothing in column 1, the page is dismissed.</div>

<div class="content">... where "do" means "take some action and either complete or rewrite in column two of the next page".<br><br>But you don't need to stick with anything more than a few minutes to get to the next page. You should be skimming lightly over the whole list rather than getting bogged down in a particular page. Mark Forster was asked how long he would spend on a typical visit to a typical task, and his answer was (from memory) about 10-20 minutes. (Of course, some of his tasks were nine mile walks, which may have taken a little longer.)</div>

<div class="content">JFentner<br><br>Let's say you are on a typical page with thirty entries in the left column and two urgent tasks in the right column.  You work through your list item by item. You do not have to work every item on the list. This is not like a regular daily todo list. You don't have to work more than one item in the left column. So let's suppose you take some action on three items in the left column and both the items in the right column. Depending on how you define your tasks, you either finish a given task, in which case you just cross it out, or you do not finish the task in which case you still  cross it out but you re-enter it either in column two of the next page (if the task is not finished according to your standard) or at the end of the list in column one if the overall project is not done, but your defined sub-task is. Completed repeating tasks are re-entered on the last page.<br><br>For example, let's say one of the tasks is a PowerPoint presentation due next week. Suppose you start on the PowerPoint on Monday. You decide to break the task into smaller parts to work on during the week. You define step one as being done when you have a first draft outline completed. You write the task as "first draft outline PowerPoint". Today you finish the first draft outline in about 20 minutes so you cross it out and re-enter it on the last page, column one, rewriting the task as "do second draft of slide presentation".   Although the whole PowerPoint is not "completed" your defined task is finished. You can work on step two when you come across the task later on the last page but for now it is done.<br><br>Another example. Suppose a task is a very important report due in two days. You want to go ahead and finish it this morning or at least sometime today. You define for yourself that you are not finished until the final report is ready to present. You begin working on the task this morning simply by doing some preliminary research for about thirty minutes and then put it aside. You took action, but did not finish the task (according to your definition.) You cross it out (you did take action) and re-enter it in column two of the next page because it is not finished. This unfinished task now entered on page two in the second column (along with any new items you have entered) will produce a pressure to move quicker through the current page in order to get to the next page to continue working on the report (or on some of the newer tasks you have entered). Effectively, this pressure will force an intuitive reckoning of what you need to be working on now. Many of items on page one will no longer stand out (which is why you end up only actioning five items).<br><br>Maybe your third task is to clear email. You finish it in ten minutes and because it is finished but repeats, you re-enter it in column one on the last page. The two unfinished tasks include some phone calls, which you finish in five minutes and a time sheet you need to sign and take to your boss. You finish that in about three minutes. So after taking some action on five items, you are ready to move to the next page. You have worked for about an hour.<br><br>So, you can have an unfinished project that is re-entered on the last page after you take some action because you did complete a defined sub-task or  you can have an unfinished project that is re-entered in column two of the next page because you did not finish it to some predefined level.<br><br>But you do not have to take action on every task.  You only have to action all items in column two and at least one of the items in column one. You can spend as much time on a page as you like of course. But as you think of more and more things that you need to do and the number of pages increases or when you start entering unfinished tasks into column two on the following page, the pressure to get moving increases. If you are feeling bogged down and feel you are not getting things done, try moving faster through the list  Chunk your tasks into smaller sub-tasks and commit to working just a handful of tasks each page. But do commit to getting through the whole list several times a day. Don't be afraid to enter work projects in small manageable chunks that are re-entered on the last page after taking actions. Reserve column two for truly urgent tasks or for those very few projects that you really need to keep working on continually page after page as you go through your list. If you feel that you are moving too fast and not getting enough really done, then you can define your tasks into bigger chunks and add more to column two.  But you won't really feel the power of any of the Autofocus versions if you do not move through the list at a decent rate.</div>
