<div class="content">Is it possible for someone to be a volunteer discussion forum moderator in order to erase those obnoxious advertisements that keep intruding in the forum?<br><br>Of course, I  only want those posts that are CLEARLY irrelevant erased.</div>

<div class="content">If Mark Forster actually wants to hand out moderator accounts, I'll volunteer. But of course it takes a lot of trust and responsibility, as the potential for misuse is great. The job should go to trusted and active members. Mike is the first that comes to my mind, somehow. (And Christine B., but I don't think she's here anymore).</div>

<div class="content">Yup.  Not a very good advertisement for time management or AF, is it?<br><br>OTOH, good to know that MF is enjoying his retirement.  :-)</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for reminding me, Andreas, I have been meaning to write to Christine to find out how she is. (That last is a great time management sentence, isn't it!)<br><br>You can always tell when I'm using AF4. I answer comments on the Forum almost immediately.</div>

<div class="content">Or require user registration with activation, if problems get really serious then require that, say, ther user's first 10 posts be approved by a moderator before being published.</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br>Does that mean you're not using AF4 very much lately? ;-)<br><br>What are your thoughts on this topic? Moderators yes/no/perhaps?<br><br>Give Christine our best wishes.<br><br>Ed:<br><br>I think requiring registration is always a barrier. The level of spam we see now is still in the range of manual deletion. The forum already has a spam protection in place (if you post a link, you must enter a captcha), which could be improved. Add a black list with obvious spam words plus a user agent filter and I think this forum can be spam free without registration.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>Should you need a moderator, I'd be happy to do it.  I own some Yahoo forums and log on to them each day to clean up.  There seems to be no way to get past spam.  Google's Gmail seems to do the best job of filtering it, but of course that does us no good here.  ;-)  There are many others who would be good choices for the job, if they volunteer and have time.  I don't think it much matters who does it so long as only clearly spam posts are deleted..  I think that having the time to do it every day is crucial.  Perhaps it would make sense to have two or more people take on the job so if one gets tied up the others can clean up.<br><br>RE:  Christine ... YES!  Please find out how she is doing.  Give her our good wishes. It also strikes me that we've not heard from Learning in a couple of weeks or so.  I'll have to drop her a note.<br><br>Hope all is well with you.  I must confess that I can't conjure up an image of you actually retired.  I mean, what IS retirement?  For me, it is only moving on to things I did not have time to do when I punched the proverbial clock.</div>

<div class="content">FWIW, I emailed Christine about 2 months ago and never heard back from her.   Been quite concerned about her ever since given that I believe she had health issues, I'd just hoped they weren't serious.</div>

<div class="content">I too worry greatly about Christine B.  My best to her....<br><br>Mark, please consider the very generous offer of people here to serve as moderators to help keep all of the spam off your website.<br><br>Best wishes,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">I've written to Christine, and will let you all know when I hear back from her. I think I've got her phone number somewhere too, if I don't hear from her.<br><br>You can also tell when I'm using AF4 by the fact that the spam is cleared almost immediately!</div>

<div class="content">Would also like to hear if Christine's doing okay. She emailed me last in August and I haven't heard since.</div>

<div class="content">I was wondering just last week what happened to Christine B.  Her posts were brilliant, and she put a lot of work into encouraging others, and creating links for various topics - she was a sort of mini-Mark! <br><br>I find it interesting that I can recognise some people's style of post before I've checked their name at the bottom, and that used to happen with Christine's.  She had such a flowing, thoughtful way of writing, and empathising with others.  Hope she's OK.</div>
