<div class="content">I've been "enhancing" Autofocus with one minor alteration, which I've found very useful. I came across a book called "The Pomodoro Technique", which is more about how to work through a set of tasks than how to manage the tasks themselves so much, although there is some degree of overlap.<br><br>The name comes from a kitchen timer which the author owned, shaped like a tomato (or "pomodoro" in Italian). When working through tasks, the author would set the timer for 25 minutes, and would not allow himself to be interrupted or distracted, short of natural disaster or actual emergency, until the time went off. Then he'd take a five-minute break and do what he wanted. This cycle constituted "one Pomodoro".<br><br>Every four Pomodoros, he'd take a half-hour break. He found that he not only got a lot more done, but he was less stressed while doing it, and less fatigued at the end of the day.<br><br>In short, my sole revision to AutoFocus is to replace the "for as long as you like" in step 3 of the original AutoFocus instructions with "for one Pomodoro".<br><br>More on the Pomodoro Technique can be found at <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/</a></div>

<div class="content">I do similar Lefty, using half hour timeboxes. I track how many timeboxes I do each day for home and work.</div>

<div class="content">I am glad this is helping many people. I recognize that different techniques work for different people. <br><br>I was hesitant to comment here, but I hope that my wish is to stimulate a civil discussion.<br><br>The way I am constituted, these kinds of "forced labor" prompt me to rebel, sooner or later. Once I tell myself I "have to" work for 10 minutes or 20 minutes, or whatever, I start to want to do something else.<br><br>Neil Fiore's reverse psychology never really helped me, where he would have me tell myself that i would limit how much I work. But Mark's reverse psychology self-talk, along the lines of, "I don't have to work on this report for very long, I am only going to open this folder up," works great for me.<br><br>As I said, I think Pomodoro is great for many. But they must be constituted differently than I am.</div>

<div class="content">When I go running, and I'm not great, I can never say okay now I'll run 5 miles. I just get out and go. When I get tired, that's where I use psychology. It may be a race where I have 2k to go, but I instead tell myself to run to the corner, or run 35 more seconds or wait till that girl is out of sight. This push is augmented by these ideas: it's only a little more, I can do that; pushing will make me stronger for next time; after this little bit we will see then if I can't do another little bit. <br><br>Pomodoro is the same way: do a little more and get a little more done. <br><br>But Moises, I never tell myself I must do anything. A pomodoro is a challenge to do a little extra, and if I don't I don't. That doesn't invalidate the challenge or my effort, and there's nothing to rebel against because it's not an obligation.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Moises, <br><br>As you rightly say, everyone's different. I do enjoy working within a (half hour) timebox as it helps me to focus hard for a set period and provides a contained boundary for me to work within. <br><br>It's also useful to collect the basic metrics as patterns tend to emerge and it feels satisfying (to me anyway) to see how much I've done over the course of a day, week etc. <br><br>Lastly, I feel timeboxing works well with Auotofocus (despite it possibly going against some of the intentions of Autofocus) as it helps provide a clear cut off, assisting in putting the list away for a while.</div>
