<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2011-01-5 18:15</div>
<div class="content">Christoph Dollis posted about managing delegated tasks in his post at <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1350467" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1350467</a> . Unfortunately, his description is on a page at his site that he linked to and today, for me, that link is broken. So I must ask (redundantly) for advice.<br><br>I have a task for which I am ultimately responsible. I am waiting for someone else to do something before I can proceed. So right now, I CANNOT do anything. How do I keep from losing focus on that task?</div>

<div class="content">Are you trying to track what you need to do once you have the item, or the item you are owned.  <br><br>For what is owed to you, depending on your system, you can enter a new task or calendar entry to call the person in the future to follow up on the request, which will remind you if you did not get what you need.  You can also keep a waiting for list of all the things people owe you.<br><br>For the task you need to do, you should enter it into your system, you could also put a note next to it that it requires something from someone else and you can maybe handle both issues with one entry.<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">Here is how I handle it. Suppose the following scenario:<br><br>Scenario: I can't do X until Mark does Y. I need to track if Mark's done Y<br><br>I write the task this way:<br><br>- ? Mark done Y  (0)  1-3<br><br>The question mark tells me I'm waiting on something. The something I'm waiting on follows the "?".<br><br>The "(0)" tells me this is the first time I have written this down and I wrote it down on January 3rd.  This means I informed Mark on January 3rd, what I needed done.<br><br>So, a couple of days go by and I check and I see he still hasn't done it. I strike-out the first entry and I re-enter the following at the end of my tasks:<br><br>- ? Mark done Y (1) 1-5<br><br>This tells me I have checked on this 1 time and the last time I checked was January 5th.<br><br>Depending on how pressing the item, after the increment gets to a certain point, you will need to follow-up with a phone call or an email.<br><br>That's how I do it.<br><br>Matt</div>

<div class="content">I would do it simpler. Have 2 list on AF list and one unfinished list <br>If something is beginning but unfinished just report it on the unfinished list with may be Wait from X and then do this. You may put it the marge when you are expecting it to be done and if it is very important put it on your diary. Then erase the task from AF list as it is unfinished. <br>Hope this help...</div>

<div class="content">I realized that this is more of a personnel management question than I time management question. Matt, I really like your idea. It both keeps the item to mind as well as documents the follow-up. That way, if things get nasty, you can always go back and say, "Yes, I asked you about it this many times on these specific dates."</div>

<div class="content">> "Yes, I asked you about it this many times on these specific dates." <<br><br>I've actually had to say that several times to people. It really helps your case.<br><br>Matt</div>

<div class="content">By the way, I also use this notation (except for the "?") for tasks I've started but haven't finished. It tells me how many times I've worked on it and the last time I worked on it.<br><br>This info feeds my subconscious and intuition.<br><br>Matt</div>

<div class="content">I've read some of the best delegators (which I ain't) would use an agenda.  <br><br>They give an assignment to a person, explain its importance, and ask the other person for a commitment when it will be done.  They record expected completion date on that agenda.  <br><br>On that date check if it's done.  If not, maybe express disappointment, but ask when it will be done.</div>
