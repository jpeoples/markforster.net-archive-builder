<div class="content">When all this urge to be productive and busy passes I sometimes turn to open my copy of Mark's "Dreams" book which I think of as his best work (at least, for my own interests). I was surprised and amused therefore to see how the great H G Wells had produced a remarkably similar set of ideas in "A Modern Utopia"<br><br><a href="http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hgwells/1905/modern-utopia/ch08.htm" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hgwells/1905/modern-utopia/ch08.htm</a></div>

<div class="content">I'm not familiar with this, and I await comments with fascination. I don't want to derail the thread, but I couldn't help thinking of The Time Machine. Could the Morlocks and the Eloi perhaps represent two extremes of bad approaches to time management - the driven and the drifting?<br><br>Chris</div>
