<div class="content">I'm currently using a combination of the following:<br><br>DWM - for tasks not related to MAJOR goal(s)<br><br>Leo's ZTD:<br>* ONE goal at a time<br>* THREE projects (work, personal, goal)<br>* THREE Most Important Tasks (work, personal, goal)<br><br>Robbin's Get The Edge/Personal Power for motivation and structure<br><br>Tool: <a href="http://www.goalsontrack.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.goalsontrack.com</a> - trying for 60 days. So far, I'm very impressed. I print my daily planner and use that throughout the day. I update software at night. I'm done, done, done with iPhone to-do apps. I hate that @!#%^%#@! keyboard :)</div>

<div class="content">Currently I am trying to hang on to a combination of ZTD and AF4.<br><br>ZTD for goals, wanted outcomes ('projects' in ZTD/GTD-language), and MITs. AF4 for all the other stuff.</div>

<div class="content">Avrum,<br><br>I checked out those sites and I think I see why you like them.  My only problem is the damn "subscription business model".  I'd rather buy a product than pay forever.  That said, the program seems to have everything you could want  It only lacks an iPhone interface.  Yeah, I know about the keyboard, but I don't do much entry on the iPhone ... I enter it on a website or the PC and then have the iPhone remind me or allow me to check things off.<br><br>At the moment, I'm using MindManager for a visual layout of my goals/outcomes and at the task level, I use Toodledo which links to the iPhone letting me see what I need to do during the day.  If I did not want a clean iPhone interface with a good calendar presentation I'd do it all in MindManager.<br><br>I'd recommend to anyone, before you invest time and money in a lot of planning in some particular tool, spend a bit of time deciding exactly how you will work:<br><br>- Will you work only from paper?<br>- Will you need the reminder capability of a PDA/Smartphone?<br>- Will you be at a desk all day long and use a desktop computer?<br>- Do you like lists, or more visual layouts (like a mind map)?<br><br>The goalsontrack system certainly is very helpful in helping create SMART goals and monitoring progress with images and motivational pictures and such.  It is also useful for habit development and the ability to print a daily schedule fills that need.  If you are at a desk computer all day or would like to work from paper (printed copy) it seems a great system.  (If a bit on the expensive side.)  Now that I'm somewhat centered on the iPhone, any system I use will have to integrate that function.</div>

<div class="content">Ooops, for a nice description of using MindManger for goal development and management:<br><br><a href="http://juicedonwriting.com/792/2009-goals-planned-in-a-dashboard-mind-map/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://juicedonwriting.com/792/2009-goals-planned-in-a-dashboard-mind-map/</a></div>

<div class="content">I’ve actually been using DIT and the MLO (MyLifeOrganized) software very consistently for the past two years, with some incredible results.  I admit that I dabbled with several iterations of AF and some other apps, but this is usually a strong sign that I’m just procrastinating!<br><br>One significant change that I made about a year ago was adding the Pomodoro  Technique.  I guess the way I have this implemented, you could call it PIT (Pomodoro It Tomorrow).  I use the standard DIT system, but when I am executing my daily list of tasks, I use the Pomodoro Technique.<br><br>I find that these two systems overlap nicely – for example, principles of “little and often”, “setting limits”, “timed bursts” and “reducing distractions and random factors” are key parts of both.<br><br>For my Pomorodo Timer, I use this little app called Egg Timer (<a href="http://www.elegantpie.com/#egg%20timer)." target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.elegantpie.com/#egg%20timer).</a>  Yes there are lots of Pomodoro –specific apps out there, but I feel that they typically over-engineer a simple timer.  This Egg Timer doesn’t require installation and it never fails.  The beauty is that it can be minimized to your task bar and still show the time counting down.  It’s less obtrusive than other timers that sit on top of other windows while still reminding you that you’re working towards that 25 minute period.</div>

<div class="content">Nice Post, Avrum:<br><br>Please refer also to Gerry's recent post (New System) re my hybrid system.<br><br>My time management beliefs and subsequent 'system', in relation to my own circumstances, are: <br><br>1.My Goal / 1 Goal (Leo Babauta): Having 1 goal to focus means I've got a much better chance of achieiving it. In 80/20 terms it is the one goal that will bring me the highest quality of life value. Or maybe the one that I just simply want to do.<br><br>2.  Organizational Project (Mark Forster): Doing this sort of project in a one-at-a-time order. This is done by order of priority from a seperate list. Again, in 80 / 20 terms, it should be the project which would bring the highest potential benefit and / or solve the biggest problem(s). <br><br>3. Daily Closed List, DIT style (Mark Forster): A great idea to minimize crisis management / putting out fires. I aim to keep this list as short as possible. For me, this list is about mainly dealing with Other Peoples Priorities in a efficient and responsible manner. I project tasks forward for Review, rather than having a 'waiting for list'<br><br>4. Everything into 1 notebook (Gerry, Ultra Simple Guide to Time Management), at least initially until the information is moved elsewhere.<br><br>5. Schedule as little as possible onto the Calander (Leo Babauta) in order to create time available to complete tasks.</div>

<div class="content">Or how about:<br><br>1. 30 Day Challenge (Babauta, Power of Less) - Great for habit change on a small but manageable scale.<br><br>2. Inbox processing session (Allen, GTD) - One a day if possible to minimize distractions / interruptions.<br> <br>3. AF1 list (Forster) - One notebook only (home & work) with capacity to contain daily notes.<br><br>As you can see, I like the concept of having 3 main things to focus on!</div>

<div class="content">@ Leon,<br><br>what kind of notebook are you using?  steno, spiral, legal pad,   what size?<br><br>thanks in advance</div>

<div class="content">Hi ms,<br><br>At the moment I'm using a Black n' Red A4 sized hard back spiral notebook. Nice quality (Optik) paper too. Recommended. <br><br>www.BlacknRed.com<br><br>I like non spiral hardback books (where pages cannot be removed) but they take up too much space as they cannot be doubled back like a spiral bound notebook. I feel hard back books are obviously more hard wearing and also comfortable when making notes if a desk is not available.  <br><br>I've tried all sorts of configurations re AF list and notes. My current approach is AF list starting from the front and Notes / Reference starting from the back. I think it's a good idea to record everything in one place, at least before it's disseminated elsewhere.</div>

<div class="content">I'm increasingly coming to the conclusion that Less Is More. I've spent far more time than I should have done over the years trying out various gadgets, systems, processes, widgets, methodologies etc to improve my effectiveness.   And in my experience, the more time I spend on it, the worse I become at Getting It All Done.   <br><br>Too much time spent looking for the perfect method ends up turning the search into an end in itself.   And (call me a heretic!),  I think that using electronic tools makes things even worse because we find ourselves responding to - and getting distracted by - every beep and whistle that they make.<br><br>For me,  I find that One Big List in a notebook supported by an old reused envelope to help focus on things that Must Be Done Today works better than anything I've tried before - There's a post from a few weeks ago that talks about old envelopes.<br><br>I also wonder whether creating a recurring AF list item entitled something like 'Tinker with Gadgets and Perfect Process' might be a neat way to put the hunt for the perfect system into a manageable box...<br><br>Dave</div>

<div class="content">"I also wonder whether creating a recurring AF list item entitled something like 'Tinker with Gadgets and Perfect Process' might be a neat way to put the hunt for the perfect system into a manageable box..."<br><br>in my experience, yes it is a good way to limit tinkering. This method also works to round out an incomplete system by grafting other elements in a well-defined way.</div>
