<div class="content">Hello, Questions for Mark Forster about Mixing AF & DIT<br><br>I regularly use AF and find it great. I did'nt read DIT but only the summery of it. I surely will. <br><br>However, AF has some inconvenient. Some has been evocated in the last thread "BAGGING AUTOFOCUS-BACK TO DIT" <br><br>As i have a lot of tasks i have sometime difficulties to focus on my today's tasks. I wonder if there can be a bridge between AF & DID. <br><br>Dear Mark, <br>You made those two methods. Imagine them and made them operational. <br>- How do you do yourself ? <br>- Is there a way to combo the two methods or are they strickly separated ? <br><br>Thanks for the answers. Sure it will be interesting for alls. <br><br>Best regards</div>
