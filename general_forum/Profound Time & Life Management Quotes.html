<div class="content">@michael:<br><<These quotes highlight the paradox between having goals and being in the moment.>><br><br>I think it is matter of view. The only moment when you can do something about your goals is present moment.<br><br>My favorite book is Shapiro: Goal-free living (it is not about living without goals but about the fact that goal is not one unmoving point in the future towards which we measure everything).</div>

<div class="content">@Mark: <br><br>many people advocate it, but few approaches tell you how to get into the moment or how to deal with what you find there. Eckhart Tolle is a big advocate but for me doesn't really give us a process.

<div class="content">Hi Michael B.<br>The way you get into a state of flow is to become fully engaged with what you are doing.  If you have someplace you must be, set an alarm.  If it's one of your natural passions, you might want to set an alarm if you have other things you need to do as well.  As long as you're fully engaged, you have no sense of time or anything else for that matter.  After all, you are actually fully engaged.  <br><br>My personal record is 30 hours straight doing an oil painting.  I begrudgingly relieved myself when necessary but didn't think about eating or sleeping.  I let myself go because I had the entire weekend off.  For playing instruments, my trance was usually only about 4-6 hours straight if I was playing alone.  If if was jamming with others and feeding on their energy, it could be much longer but since the environment has cueing, it's not a total trance. I've done long reading and writing binges also.  I don't know how to force it.  Either your brain fully engages or it doesn't.<br><br>There's nothing to deal with (other than setting an alarm if you must...). Just ride the wave.  I wish I knew how to summons it at will.  I consider it a gift when it happens because no matter what I'm doing, flow patterns are always 100% satisfying (and sometimes exhilarating).  It feels like pure rapture even if you're working hard and nonstop for many, many hours.  Just follow your passions. That's where flow lives.</div>

<div class="content">..."He experienced the feeling of a man who has found what he was seeking under his own feet, while he had been straining his eyes looking far away from himself. All his life he had looked off somewhere, above the heads of the people around him, yet there was no need to strain his eyes, but only to look right in front of him."<br><br>- <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2600/2600-h/2600-h.htm" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2600/2600-h/2600-h.htm</a> chapter 12</div>

<div class="content">michael:<br><br><< You may recall that Pierre Bezukhov has to lose all expectation of personal gratification... >><br><br>That would be apart from marrying the woman he has loved hopelessly for years, would it? Here's four chapters further on when he unexpectedly meets (and at first doesn't recognize) Natasha at Princess Maria's:<br><br>"Pierre's confusion had now almost vanished, but at the same time he felt that his freedom had also completely gone. He felt that there was now a judge of his every word and action whose judgment mattered more to him than that of all the rest of the world. As he spoke now he was considering what impression his words would make on Natasha. He did not purposely say things to please her, but whatever he was saying he regarded from her standpoint. "<br><br>Throughout the book, Pierre's idealistic revelations always collapse when exposed to real life. He still gets the girl though!</div>

<div class="content">Mark,  Your 'To Think About' on the home page is one of my favourite bits of the site!

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br>I tend to read the site on my phone which involves a lot of "pinching to expand" and scrolling around from a bird's-eye view. From this elevated view the "To Think About" section has a unique blocky shape to it depending on the content. Later, as I'm scrolling around 30,000 feet up I just check to see if the shape has changed. If so, new quote!</div>
