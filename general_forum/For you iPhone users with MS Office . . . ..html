<div class="content">Maybe when I get a new iPhone.  It's only good for the new model.</div>

<div class="content">I would love this to try - but they make it too complicated - it tells me I have to transfer to the US iTunes store, then it won't let me download as I only have an account with the UK store and transfers me back!  It a free app so I have no idea why they behave like its a paid for one!  Very frustrating!</div>

<div class="content">I still prefer Evernote (www.evernote.com). Even though Evernote doesn't have as rich a feature set for formatting, I find it more useful and more powerful for managing notes. Plus it gives you the ability to take voice notes-- a feature MS OneNote doesn't offer.<br><br>Either way, I wouldn't use either product for task management. I've tried. They don't work for me.</div>

<div class="content">I've used OneNote successfully for over a year, specifically for task management.  It's incredibly useful because I can keep the notes with the tasks, and its operation is really streamlined.  I can't imagine any other tool coming close.<br><br>The only question is how you do it.  Because it's freeform, you can do the same thing a million ways; some work better than others.</div>

<div class="content">@jFenter: you can take voice notes with OneNote, I attempted to record a day's conference with my notebook (not smartphone!), the mic I was using was not up to it though.<br><br>As Alan emphasises, it's freeform, like some of the other note products.<br><br>For myself, I'm sticking with WM 6.5 for my smartphone which I bought sim-free 18 months ago (I use PAYG in the UK and abroad due to varying locations), so cannot/will not replace it for some time.<br><br>But if I had to, I think an Android might be the next one for me.<br><br>Before replacing my smartphone, I will be getting a tablet/slate sometime this year.  7" seems suitable in terms of use + portability and many of the features on smartphones will be even better.  I want to leave my work and personal notebooks (only one at present, convertible tablet, heavyish, have to carry it to/from work) at the office and apartment respectively and use a tablet/slate (with decent handwriting capability) in between, at meetings, on flights, and on my desk as a notetaker/task resource.  Synchronisation will probably be via Dropbox so that all three devices and the smartphone stay in sync.<br><br>I might consider other applications for AF, task management etc eg Evernote when I do buy the tablet.<br><br>As my wife's netbook is about to give up the ghost, I can test the 7" form factor by getting her a Samsung Galaxy Tab next month.  It should be ideal for her, she only needs a device for email, web surfing and Skype.<br><br>BTW, anyone interested in using whiteboards on a notebook should look at notateit.com, I think there's even a kanban template available.  I'm going to investigate it on trial to use when holding workshops.</div>
