<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-01-8 11:17</div>
<div class="content">Mark, <br><br>thank you for publishing Autofocus. <br><br>Your system allows me to tackle tasks of high resistance more efficently. I am able to enter everything into the system without evaluation or priorization.  It dismisses not relevant tasks and guides me to completion of important ones and makes me more effective. <br><br>Prior to using Autofocus I used to finish 15 to 20 tasks per day. The number of completed tasks has skyrocketed to about 35 to 50 tasks per day since using Autofocus. <br><br>Chris</div>
