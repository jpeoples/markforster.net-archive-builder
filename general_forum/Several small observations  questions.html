<div class="content">I've been using AF now for three days and came across some things where I wonder what the right way (or your recommendation on the right way) is.<br><br>1. Sometimes I notice that I cannot do an item because something else need to be done first. Example: Action: Mark a thesis. Problem. thesis seems to be at home, but I'm just at the univerisity. Does that mean: Cross off the original item and add a  new one at the end of the last page? Or do I leave the original item (i.e. I have two actions for the same 'project' in my notebook)? That's a thing I observe quite often: different levels of actions at different pages: Get the thesis, get an overview about the content, mark the thesis.<br><br>2. Often I work outside of the lists: I just write an email, then it comes to my mind, I have to write also another one. It costs 5 minutes then it's finished and I can go on at the current page. Of course, the second email is noted on some other page. Is this a strong break of the rules?<br><br>3. Often I get things to do as a result of an email which I receive. Thus, the basic information for being able to do the task is somewhere on my computer. It is often quite canonical, where it is, but not always. Thus, the start of doing such a task is an intensive search for the underlying material. Therefore, I have added a column to my tasks where I indicate in that cases where the material is - quite helpful in many cases and bringing down the lead time considerably.<br><br>4. Currently, I have put anything in one notebook. Today I made the experience that on the first page no item stood out for me. But that is only half of the truth: Some I could not do at all because they were only doable at home (but I was in my office). Is that an exception of the rule to dismiss everything on that page?<br><br>That should be enough for now. Looking forward to your comments.<br><br>Wolfgang</div>
