<div class="content">I have been using AF for a month, and found that this system works better than any other time management systems I have ever used.  This forum helps me understand AF as well.<br><br>I have a question regarding "rephasing."  I am wondering when I can rephrase tasks.  In the original instruction, you see the description "re-phrase" just in the section #7 (dismissing items).  In some posts, however, people say that you can rephrase an item and cross it off.  In other words, "rephasing" can be considered as a sort of "actions."<br><br>Either way might be OK, but if there are any clear ideas or definitions as to when to rephase, it would be helpful to me.<br></div>

<div class="content">Mit, the beauty of AF means you can do it whenever it works for you! There are just no hard and fast rules unlike other systems. I have been using AF since Day One of it's release, and have found through various discussions of other peoples experiences and my own that many things can either trigger a rephrasing of a task or make that an action in itself.<br><br>For example: if I have a stubborn item or two left on an active page as part of my considering dismissing items I may find that rephrasing the entire task (maybe it was to big an item and so break it down) works. If it is just building up resistance - think about why and then maybe cross off and add to current list "Review actions needed/Consider/Discuss XXXX."<br><br>If a variable relating to that task changes then I will cross off the original task and add back in with that change taken into account.<br><br>I would definitely confirm that I see rephrasing as a legitimate "action" having been taken on a task. They system works brilliantly for me, and whilst I have toyed with tweeks I have basically stuck with the basic set of instructions, use two books @Home and @Work and manage time critical items with an action usually in the task list to ensure small steps progress and an appropriate calendar/schedule entry, it has not failed me yet. They key is continually working the pages and trusting the system.<br><br>Good luck!</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, titch!  Your comments gave me a clear vision about rephrasing.  Now I don't have any negative feelings to rephrase items as an "action."</div>
