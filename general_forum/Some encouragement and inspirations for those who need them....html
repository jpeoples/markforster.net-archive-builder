<div class="content">+AJPM+<br><br>You know, sometimes what we just need to go through our day is a little encouragement or reminder of why we are doing what we are doing.  So how about posting the most inspiring things on the 'net that you know of, for the benefit of all of us?<br><br>I'll start with these, the most inspiring music I've ever heard:<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6QCg8IG8Nc" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6QCg8IG8Nc</a><br><br>And:<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCYr8TWAGn0" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCYr8TWAGn0</a><br><br>^_____^<br><br>God bless us all.</div>

<div class="content">Great idea nuntym!<br><br>I teach kids in elementary schools. Even on the lowest of days, when I feel wretched physically and emotionally, as soon as I start an activity with a group and I see their eyes light up with joy, then feel not only my purpose on this planet but also a reward of energy and motivationnlike no other. On my lowest of days at the hospital, I was thinking of them and how I wanted to see them asap.<br><br>I don't know for your individual countries but here in Japan, kids can be very affectionate!</div>

<div class="content">Does posting poetry count? Here's "Invictus" by William Ernest Henley - obscure to me until I watched the movie. I have found this very uplifting at particular moments in my life.<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------<br>Out of the night that covers me,<br>Black as the Pit from pole to pole,<br>I thank whatever gods may be<br>For my unconquerable soul.<br>In the fell clutch of circumstance<br>I have not winced nor cried aloud.<br>Under the bludgeonings of chance<br>My head is bloody, but unbowed.<br>Beyond this place of wrath and tears<br>Looms but the horror of the shade,<br>And yet the menace of the years<br>Finds, and shall find me, unafraid.<br>It matters not how strait the gate,<br>How charged with punishments the scroll,<br>I am the master of my fate;<br>I am the captain of my soul.</div>

<div class="content">Litany Against Fear, from the Dune books by Frank Herbert.<br><br>    I must not fear. <br>    Fear is the mind-killer. <br>    Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. <br>    I will face my fear. <br>    I will permit it to pass over me and through me. <br>    And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. <br>    Where the fear has gone there will be nothing......Only I will remain.</div>

<div class="content">Mmm ... I don't think +AJPM+ means American Journal of Preventive Medicine or American Journal of Pain Management. Unfortunately my Google-fu failed me. :-/<br><br>Anyway, I'm adding to my DWM task one of the 63 ways in <a href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifehack/63-ways-to-build-self-confidence.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifehack/63-ways-to-build-self-confidence.html</a> . I'll change it to the next one when I select that task as I process my DWM list. Currently it's "4. Go to a networking event and focus on how you can be helpful to other people rather than being nervous about your own stuff." ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Unless I'm strongly mistaken, +AJPM+ is something in Latin ;)</div>

<div class="content">In this 70th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, it's good to read Churchill's speeches again in which he inspired and focused the nation's, and others, attention on survival.<br><br>I also like these quotes which are possibly more aimed at the individual:<br><br>'Keep buggering on.'  The middle word is NOT used in its other meaning, it means just keep going, trying your best despite whatever you feel is assailing you.<br><br>'Never, never, never, never give up.'<br><br>And now there are the Chilean miners (the 'Thirty Three'), thier families and rescuers to inspire us in some way.</div>

<div class="content">+AJPM+<br><br>Hi JD,<br><br>Now that brings back memories! Back in my college years, at ROTC (Reserved Officers Training Corps), "Invictus" is one of the poems we must memorize until we can recite them in our sleep.  I'm gonna memorize that again, forgot some of it already.<br><br>Thank you, JD!<br><br>Another of those poems is "If" by Rudyard Kipling:<br><br>If<br><br>If you can keep your head when all about you<br>Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;<br>If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,<br>But make allowance for their doubting too;<br>If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br>Or, being lied about, don't deal in lies,<br>Or, being hated, don't give way to hating,<br>And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise;<br><br>If you can dream - and not make dreams your master;<br>If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim;<br>If you can meet with triumph and disaster<br>And treat those two imposters just the same;<br>If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken<br>Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br>Or watch the things you gave your life to broken,<br>And stoop and build 'em up with wornout tools;<br><br>If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br>And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br>And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br>And never breath a word about your loss;<br>If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br>To serve your turn long after they are gone,<br>And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br>Except the Will which says to them: "Hold on";<br><br>If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,<br>Or walk with kings - nor lose the common touch;<br>If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you;<br>If all men count with you, but none too much;<br>If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br>With sixty seconds' worth of distance run -<br>Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,<br>And - which is more - you'll be a Man my son! <br><br>-----------------------------<br><br>Cricket,<br><br>I've read that before, and I really like it.   *sigh* I've wanted to read one of the "Dune" books, but I keep on forgetting to buy one.  Oh well.<br><br>Anyways, here is a shorter version of the litany:<br><br>"Fear is useless; what is needed is trust." <br> - Jesus Christ (Luke 8:50, Mark 5:36)<br><br>-----------------------------<br><br>sabre23t, Erik, and Mark,<br><br>Yep! +AJPM+ is "Ad Jesum Per Mariam" (it is more correctly +AIPM+ for "Ad Iesum Per Mariam" as Latin does not have a "J," but anyways...), the motto that gives great confidence for me.  It translates into English as "To Jesus Through Mary," and it is the motto of those who have done the Perfect Contrition to Jesus through Mary, a way of devotion by Catholics.<br><br>-----------------------------<br><br>Alan, <br><br>That's one weird song, but it IS inspiring.<br><br>Thanks!<br><br>-----------------------------<br><br>Alan, Roger J,<br><br>You know, I have this stupid daydream sometimes that I was a musician/composer during World War II privy to much of Allied intelligence, and I'd compose this song for the D-Day landings to be played for the Allied soldiers before the invasion,<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VR1bOha40U" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VR1bOha40U</a><br><br>And I'd compose this for V-E Day:<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCYr8TWAGn0" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCYr8TWAGn0</a><br><br>But oh well ^___^<br><br>-----------------------------<br><br>Have anyone else found U2 songs to be very inspiring?<br><br>Beautiful Day: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co6WMzDOh1o&ob=av2e" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co6WMzDOh1o&ob=av2e</a> --> A perfect way to start the morning! The last refrain is my alarm sound ^__^<br><br>"It was a beautiful day<br>Don't let it get away<br>Beautiful day...<br><br>Touch me!<br>Take me to that other place!<br>Reach me!<br>I know I'm not a hopeless case!<br><br>What you don't have you don't need it now<br>What you don't know you can feel it somehow<br>What you don't have you don't need it now<br>Don't need it now<br>It was a beautiful day"<br><br>^___^<br><br>Stuck in A Moment: <a href="http://new.music.yahoo.com/U2/videos/view/Stuck-In-A-Moment-You-Can--39-t-Get-Out-Of--37310533" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://new.music.yahoo.com/U2/videos/view/Stuck-In-A-Moment-You-Can--39-t-Get-Out-Of--37310533</a> --> Get a gentle kick on pants by reminding you of the dangers of fear, worrying, and regrets.  Scenes of the video are very relevant, btw.<br><br>God bless.</div>

<div class="content">Nuntymm<br><br>Kipling's If is my father's favourite and one of my top 10. I don't like all of Kipling's writings, but when he gets it right, he nails it. Breaking Strain and Sons of Martha are other favourites.<br><br>Read the Dune books in the order published. The earlier ones are great, then they wander, then I stopped reading.<br><br>I agree with Jesus's statement, but there are times when something longer is needed. A short mantra you repeat blindly becomes background, but a litany needs a bit more thinking, unless overused to the point it becomes a mantra.</div>

<div class="content">Nuntym - That Kipling poem was simply wonderful!<br><br>And you know, that U2 song - Stuck in the Moment - I know I've heard it along with all the other hits, but never paid enough attention to the lyrics until you pointed out what they signify. <br><br>Thanks all for all the postings here, great pick-me-up when needed.</div>
