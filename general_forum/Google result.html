<div class="content">I've just Googled Autofocus and Wikipedia is the top result with a page about cameras. Maybe it would be worth addidng a Wikipedia page for Mark's AF?<br><br>I'd have a go myself but as I'm just about to start using AF don't feel I have the qualifications to do so.<br><br>Just a suggestion.<br><br>Andrew</div>

<div class="content">The questions to ask first are:<br><br>Is AF popular, complex, controversial, important, etc. enough to require a "neutral" third party POV? Or does this website provide enough information for someone interested in AF to become informed about AF in a fair and reasonable manner?<br><br>Rather than AF, Mark could be an entry in wikipedia. Again the above questions among others need to be asked.<br><br>IMHO, the answer is no to an AF entry and perhaps to the second. If someone is going to start an entry on Mark, they should read wikipedia's standards for entries about living persons. They are fairly clear and by following them it should become clear whether the article has enough import for wikipedia.<br><br>JMO, FWIW, etc.</div>

<div class="content">LOL @ me! Mark is already in wikipedia. Nothing is mentioned of AF. That could be added to his entry.<br><br></div>
