<div class="content">I have used AF1 and AF2 in the past without much success, the list had become huge and it was more stressful than just picking the tasks as if they were all on an open list. But I discovered AF4 and decided to give it a try since it is easy to implement electronically.<br>I am using “thinking space“, a mind mapping soft on Android. I have a node for work and another for personal projects, then 2 nodes from there, one for the closed list and one for the open list.<br><br>What makes AF4 great is that it allows you to have structure while letting you choose the task you like almost all the time.<br><br>Explanation:<br>If there is a task on the open list you want to do, you just have to do A LITTLE of a task on  the closed list then you can skip to  the task you want to do on the opn list. It s just like nothing more will stand out for you on the closed list.<br><br>So it is pretty much like you are ALWAYS ONE TASK AWAY THE TASK YOU WANT TO DO. <br>If you think this way it is not stressful while at the same time helpng you complete all sorts of tasks.<br>I will continue to test this way of working with AF4 and tell you if it fails somewhere.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Mark.<br><br>I want to precise a few things on my way of writing tasks.<br>In the past I have always been overwhelmed by the number of tasks on things I would like to do but was procrastinating about. In fact the number of these tasks would break up the system, whether it would be GTD, autofocus, or any customized or electronic one. <br><br>The problem may be the brain dump thing.<br><br>So right now I am writing as tasks only what I really want to do (and which seems realistic) and what I really have to do. Nothing else. <br>Well in fact I have written 2 notes yesterday to write this post though, not because I want but because I couldn't sleep without freeing my mind of these thoughts.<br><br>So, overall I have a high quality list and I must say really useful independently of the system.<br><br>If one doesn't know what is realistic or useful in the first place, one may not be committed enough to do anything more than one month. The state of mind in which we write any task may be a very very important factor. Maybe the most?<br><br>Other precisions.<br>When I have a project, instead of writing the project  name I write the successive actions needed for this project. Since they will be entered one after the other they can easily be done successively if needed.<br><br>The most difficult rule to follow for me is writing the task at the end of the list when I take a break. I always want to  continue the same task all day long, without doing anything else besides breaks... which can be long. I'm working on this right now.</div>

<div class="content">I have problems with the applications Thinking Space on android. This is the best app to use with autofocus but it crashes when too much info is inserted.<br>So I am trying to find another app to use with autofocus on android but I'm yet to find it.<br>I have used all the popular todo list apps available but they don't keep the task in the exact order I have entered them. <br>I tried remember the milk and same problem.<br>Is there someone using autofocus successfully on Android?</div>
