<div class="content">Not sure if this has been said before.<br><br>But 1 idea is to have a list for computer or errands<br>Still write all items on main list and also have an item ""transfer computer items or errands to their own list""  and ""work on computer or errand list""<br><br>?????</div>

<div class="content">Hi Margherita<br><br>I found it helpful to review a lot of the systems and lists I was already keeping.  By adding everything into AF it became clear that there were some things that fell into the sort of categories you mention.  Putting everything into AF does not mean that we instantly eliminate every other data repository that we work with but for me it has helped to identify which ones were not working in the best way (for me).  With errands e.g. buy "oven cleaner" I initially added them to the list.  They then became a task I could not do until I went shopping and by the time I added a second "buy x" item I realised that my tasks needed changing.  I added a task "create shopping list" (which for me also meant defining how and where that was to be kept so it became a tool rather than another piece of paper to lose), "buy oven cleaner" was rephrased as "add oven cleaner to shopping list" and items "go shopping" and "print shopping list" naturally added themselves to the list as well.<br><br>The listing of seemingly small items in that way may seem pedantic but that has been one of the great things for me about AF.  It gives a place to put every thought, idea, task etc down, without questioning it, grading it, or worrying about it.  If someone phones and I need to do something I add it to the list.  If they give me a piece of information that needs to be entered somewhere else I can task it as "enter xxx" etc.  No more bits of paper everywhere, no more lost telephone numbers, and a big increase in efficiency.  Even if I have not actioned something I now know where it is.  And all after just three days .....<br><br>As you can no doubt tell I am loving the system ..........   :-)</div>
