<div class="content">Fascinating feedback, you must be well pleased, Mark.<br><br>However, I cannot help feeling some folk have ben expecting the instant, perfect solution to his/her own situation<br><br>You have to TRY AFTM, assess and modify, see what works for you, because in the end YOU are what matters in your own personal quest for the Time Management Holy Grail.<br><br>Mind you, I feel a bit hypocritical, I've been trying so many different methods and approaches.  GTD made an impression, DIT really made sense, so I'm willing to give AFTM a good chance.<br><br>R</div>

<div class="content">Well said Roger<br><br>I've been finding of late that the first person to ask about anything I want to know is me! It's great finding folks like Mark etc. to help us but like he so often tells us - figure out what works best for you.<br><br>Having said that, with a system like Autofocus I do believe in sticking as closely as possible to the instructions at first since some things don't become clear until you've been using a system for a while. Then, and only then, once you've used it and really got to know it you will find areas that need tweaking to make it work best for you. However, unless you've got to know the system well by using it then you may miss a core bit of the philosophy behind the system that makes it work so well in the first place.<br><br>So far, and of course it's very early days, I'm very impressed by Autofocus and think it is most likely the system I've been looking for for a while now.<br><br>Thanks Mark</div>

<div class="content">PS In no way do I mean what Mark says isn't entirely valid. All I mean by asking myself first is that so often we tend to turn outwards to others for information, advice or approval that we forget how often we know what we need or want already. <br><br>The excellent thing about Autofocus is that it is exactly this inner knowledge that Mark seems to have tapped into for making decisions about what to do. The combination of gut feeling and logic is brilliant.</div>

<div class="content">Hannah:<br><br>You have it absolutely right. Try it first exactly the way it is written and *then* make modifications to suit yourself.<br><br>To many people do it the other way round and then wonder why it doesn't work!</div>
