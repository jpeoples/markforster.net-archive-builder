<div class="content">Perhaps working all the time doesn't make us productive.<br><br>I've been reading "How to be bored" by Eva Hoffmann who argues, in part, that digital technologies have altered our sense of time and created an addiction to stimulus and activity. She argues we must set apart time for musing and reverie and idleness to re-orient ourselves.<br><br>She is interviewed at <a href="http://soundcloud.com/radioheadspace/54-how-to-be-pt-2-eva-hoffman" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://soundcloud.com/radioheadspace/54-how-to-be-pt-2-eva-hoffman</a></div>

<div class="content">I am fascinated by this striving versus reflecting duality. Sloth is of course sinful! But then workaholism is perhaps equally so. Bertrand Russell even went so far as to advocate a 4 hour working day.<br><br>I found this:<br><br>“Against the grain of this [U.S. cultural] optimism, I would argue that melancholia sometimes leads to insights and ways of thinking not accessible to joy, and that poetry especially is richer when the voices of melancholy are not shouted down by the voices of optimism,” writes James Pate. <br><br>- <a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2015/07/let-melancholy-not-be-diluted-by-cheap-optimism-santiago-vizcainos-destruction-in-the-afternoon/?woo" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2015/07/let-melancholy-not-be-diluted-by-cheap-optimism-santiago-vizcainos-destruction-in-the-afternoon/?woo</a></div>

<div class="content">@ michael<br>I think boredom and melancholy are two different things. And I'd not go that far to make space for melancholy on purpose because that is a state of mind that just happens and I don't think we should look for it. Oriental meditation suggests that we don't try to look the other way when we're sad or upset, but to try and experience that feeling fully while observing ourselves and our reactions; that has the effect to wash away the bad feeling thanks to the aquired consciousness. However I think the next logical step is to face what we discovered to be the problems afflicting us, not to look for more blue.<br>That said, I remember that when I was a teenager I liked to indulge into melancholy. It wasn't sadness, as I remember to like it particularly in very happy moments like a party that I was enjoying for example, where I would isolate myself somewhere ruminating about some girl or friendship or other "high" things. It kind of "contrasted" me, allowing me to experience a broader range of feelings.<br>Malancholy in that sense isn't that bad. I don't know, I'm probably confusing melancholy with grief and what I wrote previously about meditation is really to be intended with the latter.<br>Boredom, I was never good at liking it.</div>

<div class="content">Scheduling high quality "Goof Off Time" into the day makes me more productive. Just knowing I have it coming up keeps me motivated to fully finish the task at hand so I can enjoy the time off with more peace of mind and freedom from thinking about the incompletion still alive in my brain.</div>

<div class="content">Using 5T (loosely) has helped me balance my relaxation time better. I try to keep each batch to about an hour.<br><br>Actually, more like 5/0T. List 5 tasks, and finish them all. Mostly. In theory. In reality I often miss one or two, but then have to decide whether to go back to them or delete.<br><br>I often see that a batch will exhaust me, so add a relaxation task. Or I see that an entire hour is really undemanding, so add something harder.<br><br>It leads to a much better balance compared to unfocused work, often of low importance, followed by too much difficult work in a long stretch.</div>

<div class="content">On reflection, I think I was trying to suggest that time needs setting aside for self-reflection, as well as rest and relaxation. Without self-knowledge activity can be doing out of the need for distraction, or doing for the sake of having done something. Purposeful activity needs self awareness as a foundation. I use Gibbs' reflective cycle myself: <a href="http://www.businessballs.com/reflective-practice.htm" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.businessballs.com/reflective-practice.htm</a></div>
