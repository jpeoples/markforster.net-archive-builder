<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">I'm essentially a complete convert to Autofocus, and intend to post some overall beta-tester feedback soon (or rather, that's a possible task I've added to my AF list), but I thought I'd post an idea I had about handling email in the meantime in case anyone else finds it useful. (I hope I'm not reinventing the wheel here – I've been reading the forum posts pretty regularly, and haven't seen anyone else mention this approach.)<br><br>The problem I wanted to address is this: In accordance with the principles of AF, I look at email when I come to the recurring 'Email' item on my AF list and it stands out, and then I read and respond (as necessary) for as long as I feel like it. Usually, however, that's not long enough to deal with everything in my inbox; and I've been taking a cherry-picking approach. The result, perhaps inevitably, has been that some emails were sitting in my inbox for a relatively long time. That started to make me anxious. <br><br>It's a fairly obvious idea, but I then thought of treating my inbox as an AF list in itself, where the pages are days, so to speak. For example: Suppose I go in and see 15 messages with arrival dates spread over 3 days, say – Mon, Tues, and Weds. I start with the Mon emails, do a quick scan of just those, then go over them again waiting until one stands out, and deal with that one...etc. I don't move on to consider Tues emails until I've completed a circuit through my Mon emails without anything standing out (or until I've dealt with all the Mon emails, of course). Thus I might move on to Tues emails leaving some Mon emails unaddressed (for now); and I might end up dismissing emails. (I suppose I could archive them in a "Dismissed" folder for periodic review, but in the case of email it seems pretty unlikely to me that I'd ever want to respond to one a month from now that I didn't stand out for me now.) I go on in this way until I no longer feel like doing email, at which point I stop and go back to my (real) AF list. And I flag the email after the last email I've just dealt with so that next time I do some email, I know where I left off.<br><br>I haven't been doing things this way for long, but so far it seems to be working, and for all the reasons AF does, of course.<br><br>I realise that there are other non-cherry-picking approaches one can take, some of which have been discussed on the forum; I'm just presenting this as another option, without imagining that it would work for everyone.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hello Martin: Nice system you got going there. I have a similar "Emails" AF task, and I deal with them from top to bottom, no really based on arrival date. Once I know what is the task to be performed on an email, I enter in on the last page of the AF list, flag the email (say green for "Autofocused emails") and remove it from my Inbox to the archive folder. As an Outlook user, I have already created a search folder for green flagged emails. So when I reach that task in AF, I simply go to search folder, pull it out and work on it. When done, I remove the green flag on it.<br><br>Anything that can be done in a couple of minutes is actioned right away during the designated AF time for it, without the process above.<br><br>Thanks for sharing your set up.</div>

<div class="content">Martin:<br><br>Yes, it's perfectly possible to extend the principles of AF to things like email, and the way you suggest is one which I would imagine would work well - I might try it out myself, though at the moment I am clearing email completely each time I deal with it.<br><br>It occurs to me that it could also be applied to paper. If you had a folder for each day's unactioned correspondence it would be easy to control.Personally I find paper a much higher resistance subject than email, so it's good to have another tool to tackle it with.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for that Martin, that's really helpful.<br><br>I've been cherry picking my email as well, and writing any acttion points required into my lists.  Any action emails I am transferring into a separate folder called Autofocus so that I know where they are when they stand out on my lists, but your suggestion sounds like an excellent way of approaching those that pile up when the task does not stand out for a while.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks all of you for this thread, it's helped me with a couple of issues I was going to Post on today! Incoming post, mark i am going to trial your folder suggestion. Christine I am similarly going to use an AutoFocus folder in my inbox and see how that goes as I currently also list any actions as i go in my @Work AF (as you do) but was then struggling with best way to keep track if i was not yet ready to file them completely, wanted to maintain an empty inbox and needed speedy retrieval sometimes! I shall let you know how i progress.<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Nice idea! I like it and its application to paper, too. What I've been doing is starring emails (through gmail) that have to be actioned later. Then I have "Work on starred emails" as a task. But I am going to give this method a go.</div>

<div class="content">Glad the idea seems interesting to people. I should add that when I come to an email that provokes some associated task (other than just replying to it, that is), I add that task to the end of my (real) AF list and deal with it separately, as it comes up there, just as some of you do. I'm using this approach just for the email aspect of email, so to speak.</div>

<div class="content">Very cool idea.  I've got some old email in my Gmail account and I want to get that inbox to zero.  (My work inbox I keep at zero.)  So I'm testng this...<br><br>- Copied email From and Subject lines into Excel (only 55 items)<br>- Printed them onto 5 pages, 11 per page<br>- Scheduled a task in AF for dealing with this mini-AF mail list<br>- Now, work through these 5 pages as I do AF<br><br>Once I get this list to zero, I'll just keep it there the way I do my work inbox.  Thanks for the suggestion Martin!</div>

<div class="content">Martin, good clarification. If an email task can't be performed via email/computer/Internet, I add it to my AF list. Otherwise, it stays in email.</div>
