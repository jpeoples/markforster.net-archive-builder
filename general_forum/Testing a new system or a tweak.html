<div class="content">Hi everybody,<br>every once a while I feel the urge to test a tweak or -luckily very seldom- I want to try a completely new approach.<br>What I find is, that testing a new system or tweak while running parallel the current system has two side-effects:<br>a/ It throws obstacles into to the current system and makes it perform worse - so, the feeling that I need a new system/tweak grows (probably unnecessarily)<br>b/ the new system got interfered by the struggle to keep the current system running.<br>Tips for testing a new system/tweak while keeping the current system alive?<br>Or, is it recommended to give up the current system while testing - IMHO this could end in an untrustworthy system?</div>

<div class="content">I'm baffled. How could you possibly use two systems that do the same thing at the same time? That seems a recipe for both getting muddled.  You can easily have two systems at once if they are complementary.</div>

<div class="content">Alan,<br>probably thats the reason why asked that question ;-)<br>How do you make sure, that if you start to try a new system and completely turn the switch, that nothing gets lost - how can you trust the new system, if you start new without having an eye to the "old" system/stuff. Probably you miss some landmines which are lying in the field of the abandoned system. Otherwise you have to transfer all the stuff from the old system to the new one?!<br><br>Probably I don't see the trees for the forest :-(</div>

<div class="content">It depends on the old system. Unless it requires a lot of time to "work the system", keep the old one around as a safety net, then update and review it daily? weekly? semi-weekly?</div>

<div class="content">Whenever I've made a transition from one system to another, I would treat the old system like any other backlog:  add it to my list of things to deal with, in the new system.</div>
