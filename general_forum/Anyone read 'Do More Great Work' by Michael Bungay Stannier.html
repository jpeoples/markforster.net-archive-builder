<div class="content">Great packaging, but the content is the same ol, same ol. The graphs gimmick might be interesting to a newbie self-help reader, but I find the approach tired. <br><br>I'd skip the purchase and listen to his podcast with Seth Godin. IMHO, it's Godin at his finest.</div>

<div class="content">Just checked out Bungay Stannier's website.   At first glance, at least, he seems like a consummate wanker.   But Seth Godin sounds intelligent and interesting .  I'd never heard of him before.  Emmanuel, have you found Godin's work helpful and worth reading?</div>
