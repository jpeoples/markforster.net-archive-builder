<div class="content">Hi all<br>I must confess......I have yet to read a task that doesn't stand out!  Maybe I'm subconsciously pre-sorting what goes on my list.  When I make a list, I aim to complete it.  I'm rather enjoying the effects of the free style, yet.......all items stand out.  Hence, I've been cheating and going to the next page on occasion.  *blush*<br>Luckily, I only have a few pages....as this is a second attempt at it.  I'm sure that I read somewhere that I can break convention and allow common sense to prevail.  Now, I'm reading that I'm stuck on a page until I've "touched" at all that stand out.........That makes a lot of incompleted projects, rather than a few to focus on.  (My regular items aren't on the list as I feel comfortable with how I do them at present.  My AF list is mostly discretionary tasks....yet....still I don't want to be jailed to a page that I created randomly nor do I want many loose ends.....What to do?<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">learning as I go<br><br>Just a suggestion - if they are all standing out ask yourself another question, "is this standing out because I feel like doing this now or is it standing out because I feel I ought to do this now?"  It's sometimes a bit hard to tell, particularly when there are fewer items left on a page. Mark mentions that resistance decreases over the course of the various reviews and I think the edges can get a bit blurred when we are left with items that we had a resistance to at first ....</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine....<br>To be frank, I'm in such pain, I don't even want to be cognizant right now....so I guess during these times there must be some component of "aught to" in there!  LOL!  If I went to only want to, I'd like to be passed out!  LOL!  But I don't really have that option!  LOL!   I haven't had a lower pain day in several days so the pain is barking too loudly to figure out why all the items are standing out.....I can't pay attention to resistance, otherwise others would be in charge of my affairs and finances!  LOL!   AHA!  That's why they are all standing out......LOL!   Partly joking....part of it is me wanting to give myself a decent life as well.....I don't want to be a slug!  LOL!  This why I'm having such a rough time...pain necessitates that I use rational thinking to get things done and when in bad enough pain, I take breaks....but that doesn't make it hurt any less.........<br>It only gives me awhile to gather up my wits and resolve to go back into the trenches!  LOL!  When the pain is low enough, maybe I'll get a better feel for what you are talking about.  I feel like a marathoner who's dragging but determined to finish the race....and praying that,hopefully, I'll catch a second wind!  LOL!  Plus, I feel the pressure of that huge clock up there for all to see my time.......(My inner coach driving me)<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">learning as I go<br><br>Above all else you have to use what works for you, and if that means using a fixed system at some times and AF at others then that is ok - you will know those times when you can use AF more freely. But you also need to know that sometimes it is ok just to be rather than do. It's always good to remember that we're human beings and not human doings!  At those times you just tell your inner coach that it's his day to get that clock serviced and not to come back 'til you're ready!</div>

<div class="content">I don't know if this will help but ...<br><br>A long time ago I learned that I approach this sort of thing with a subconscious question (or questions).  The problem is that so long as the question was subconscious, I did not have control of the process.  I learned to make the question explicitly conscious so that I could control the outcome.  In reading items on the AF list here are a few questions that might be asked.  Try asking them and see how the results differ.<br><br>- Do I want to do this?<br>- Can I do this now?<br>- Is this the best thing I can be doing?<br>- Will this get me to my ultimate goals more quickly than the other items?<br>- Will this get the monkeys off my back so that I can fell less pressured?<br>- Will this make <some person> proud of me?<br>- Etc.<br><br>I think you'll find that the question you ask will produce very different results.  In particular, you should find that some of these questions will have all items standing out and others just one or a few.  Try it and let us know how it goes.<br></div>

<div class="content">learning as I go:<br><br>Good advice from Christine and Mike as usual.<br><br>One other thing you might try is to set yourself a limit of doing no more than half the items on any one page before you move on to the next. How you decide which half to do is up to you.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks to all!<br>The pain is so bad that all of it is a combination of doing what's necessary and attempting to uphold my standards of both living and character.<br>It's hard to describe, but, the pain is too distracting or the drugs too strond.  During these times, I simply need my checklists and my MITs.  I'm excited to give AF a better go when I'm not getting stungun zapped, burned or drugged!  LOL!<br>I've always been an active achiever.....true, decent standards survival isn't much to crow about, but I'm DOING DAILY what my doctors say I shouldn't be able to do....plus, I'm not drug addicted!!!!!   Those are my ongoing goals.  Plus.....pain WORSENS with boredom.....I'd rather be at least attempting things, than relaxing like everybody says I should do.  But I'm ambulatory and cognizant!  LOL!  .....and when the pain abates....it's really WONDERFUL to be current, so that I can sieze the opportunites without trepidation or being burdened with undone stuff.  I'm either going to be heavily drugged or in hard pain.  I just use my past memories to push through it.  In sports, we used to be called to continue with broken fingers, toes, sprained ankles, bleeding cuts, etc........In fact, it makes me proud that I still have the "stuff"!  LOL!<br><br>I'll come back to AF when my pain abates a bit.....hopefully soon......it's been several days.....plus, I'm more interested in getting sleep longer than 2 hours........when I hurt less I can sleep and learn more effectively.<br><br>I crossed off lots of things and logged in only 5hours hard work today between being glued to my TV set from 7:30 am until 10pm ish.....(I couldn't get anybody to drive to the actual innauguration with me.......I scrubbed walls, painted trim, mopped floors, etc....The bright side of pain bouts........I get a lot of grunt work out of the way!  LOL!  Usually boring, now the only stuff I can mentally keep up with!  LOL!  See?  There's a good to anything............<br><br>THANK YOU, ALL!<br>I'm keeping up with my stuff even though I'm on the AF list bench for now......I hope to get some AF game play soon!<br>learning as I go<br>p.s  pardon the verbosity of a drug altered mind!  LOL!</div>

<div class="content">Does anybody else use CSPAN to keep them company while they get the boring tasks out of the way?  Music makes me want to dance or play an instrument.....unless there is someone else in the room!  LOL!  Since my short term memory loss is worst in oral apprehension and memory, I can get lots of mileage with one taping..... usually, it takes many repeats before I begin to remember it<br><br>What else do you all do to keep on with boring work or hard labor tasks?<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Re: Inauguration.  Only the mad went, and only the completely insane tried to drive ... most roads were closed.  Metro started at 4:00am and the lines to get into the stations were around the parking lots.  The parking lots were quickly filled.  The train cars were filled and people did not clear the doors so it took twice forever to get moving after every stop.  It was bitter cold and porta potties were few and far between (well, actually, they were few but mostly bunched up ;-)  And for that, what did you get?  You got to stand in the cold for hours to watch it on a big TV.  I stayed home, watched it on my TV, was warm and had plenty to eat, and I had my choice of coverage.<br><br>Be glad you did not attempt it.  ;-)</div>

<div class="content">learning as I go<br><br>You have to do what is right for you at any given time and it sounds as though you have a very good handle on that.  It is great that AF is working for you when you are able to use it and great that you have a system that works for you at other times.  The important thing is to identify what is right for you!<br><br>Know what you mean about music - I used to listen to a great jazz station when I was in Chicago a lot and listened to it online but now they restrict internet access to US stations to US IP addresses.  Need to find an alternative - ah, add to list!  <br><br>Look after yourself and I hope things ease up for you shortly .....</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike<br>LOL!  You're probably right!  LOL!  When I was watching the crowds on the tv, it instantly reminded me of Martin Luther King's Poor Man's March iand.....the anti-war demonstrations!  LOL!  Some of my family still lives there!  It's a wonderfully exciting place to live!  Someone would have to be almost brain-dead to ever get bored there!  As a child, my two favorite spots were the Smithsonian Space museum and the Library of Congress... again, I digress......*blush*<br>learning as I go<br><br>Hi Christine<br>Thank you!  You're correct.....There's no disloyalty to AF to do things my own way.  I need my checklists and my MITs to stay on track and feel a sense of accomplishment.  However.....I might think about what you said....maybe I'm giving over blood, sweat and tears too much.....lower my standards a bit?  That's hard to swallow!  LOL!  I've already been forced to give up the most of my historical recollections, my abilities and career and other aspects of my old life......all I have left is to preserve the values and perspective that allowed it to happen in the first place!  LOL!   Stem cell research might be my get out of jail pass!  LOL!  I want to be ready if it ever comes to pass!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">learning as I go<br><br>Standards and values are a vital part of who we are but we have to be sure that they are really ours and not some that have been imposed upon us (within reason of course - I would not advocate giving up a value/standard to "not break the law"!)  Sometimes though we may have been brought up to think that not doing the washing up before going to bed is the a most appalling thing to do and akin to mass murder!  If I leave a dirty coffee cup in my sink overnight will the world end?  I don't think so! If I leave the washing up from Christmas lunch until Easter is that a good move?  I think not! Therefore I will reidentify my value lower than perfection but closer to perfect than leaving the dishes until Easter!  By looking at where *our* standards and values truly lie releases a lot of unnecesary stress.  But *don't* get stressed by thinking about that until you're feeling better - actually don't get stressed by it then either! :-)<br><br>And remember, that you will probably still have photos and memorabilia of your old life. Even if you can't recall all of the events you can look at those photos and remember that you enjoyed those times.  None of us, regardless of health, can ever go back to the times and emotions of our photos, but we can always take comfort from the fact that we had those good times........</div>

<div class="content">Re-reading this thread more than five years down the road, I realise that the obvious answer to learning's query is that if they all stand out then you do them in the order they are written down - at least until you find one that doesn't!</div>
