<div class="content">Hi Joe,<br><br>Well, it really does not matter overall which actions to choose first to complete as the goal is to complete ALL of your actions for the day on the closed list.  Now, with that said, I still tend to review my actions list for the day and think of what is most important to complete for the day, which is going to take the most mental energy, which will really make me feel like I have accomplished something that propels my career forward...and do those in the morning when I am still fresh.  <br><br>-David</div>
