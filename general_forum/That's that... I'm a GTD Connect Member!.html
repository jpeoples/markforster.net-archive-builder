<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">I came to a resolution about what to do with all my hacking, DIY journal creation, etc. At the end of the day, I need to finish writing my book, raise my son(s), and write music. I don't aspire to be a productivity expert. I just want to find scaffolding to help me get the meaningful things done. <br><br>For now, I've invested $48 for 1 month of GTD Connect services. I already own Omnifocus (iPhone & Mac) and a GTD Note Taker wallet (yes, I'm serious). Worst case scenario, in one months time, I'll be back here, $48 poorer, with my tail between my legs. <br><br>In the meantime, I'm going to continue these discussions - with a focus on gtd living - on the GTD Connect forum. <br><br>Muchos gracias to everyone on this forum (particularly Mark) for helping me get some clarity on this issue.</div>

<div class="content">Several years ago I took the GTD Connect free trial for several weeks.<br>My overall impression was really positiv. The exercises with the intention journal were helpful.<br>I think , actually GTD Connect is the missing part of GTD that is not written in the GTD book.<br>Have fun. <br><br>What about me? Why didn't I stay with it? It was not sustainable for me. Too much work!<br><br>When you find yourself in a hole, stop digging!</div>

<div class="content">"Why didn't I stay with it?"<br><br>Rainer - <br><br>I can provide many answers to that question... regardless of the system. I was most faithful to Covey's system (2001 - 2002), which had a lot of overhead. But the novelty of learning about a productivity system, and a very exciting work project, sustained my interest. <br><br>I'm turning to GTD for the community and ongoing education/resource material. At the end of the day, whatever system I use, I still have to work with my resistance, fear and inertia. I've been in this game long enough to know that these things are much more powerful than rules and systems.</div>

<div class="content">I am bit surprised Avrum! I also have quite hard crisis with all management systems and turn more into myself-than-system approach, but going to GTD and reading all this connect forums stuff is really not right way, at least for myself (been there done that in 2007-2009). Few bucks is not big deal, but time…</div>

<div class="content">An Update (comparing two weeks of data: 1st week pre-GTD Connect, using SMEMA & 2nd week GTD +DWM rules):<br><br>Time Wasting Activity: Up by 2.2 hours<br>Productivity Activity: Up by 2.3 hours<br>Time spent on my book: Up by 1 hour</div>

<div class="content">Avrum<br><br>Serious questions. Was the time wasting activity a result of the switch to gtd and was increased productivity also a result of gtd.  thanks for the update</div>

<div class="content">"Was the time wasting activity... and was increased productivity also a result of GTD"<br><br>I'm not sure. I'm really enjoying GTD Connect, particularly the plethora of audio/visual material. Last week I completed a Weekly Review, perhaps the first time I achieved this in years. More importantly, I'm tracking all of my computer time, and that alone raises the stakes for mindfulness and responsibility.</div>

<div class="content">"Few bucks is not big deal, but time…"<br><br>Navigare - <br><br>So long as I'm making progress on my meaningful goals, I don't consider time spent learning time/life management systems a waste.</div>
