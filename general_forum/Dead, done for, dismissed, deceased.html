<div class="content">How to make the "dead, done for, dismissed, deceased" sting, and sting bad. I can think of only one way. When the day arrives (7 or 30 days), tasks unactioned get deleted. No someday/maybe list... no reentering by changing a pronoun or verb. The only way the deleted task/project gets re-added to the list, is when guilt, anxiety and other neurotic motivators outweigh the benefits of not doing the task/project. Hell, the aforementioned feelings are swirling around my head anyway, might as well use them to my advantage.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Seraphim<br>I read that almost 30 years ago and it still pops into my mind when I find myself waffling, making excuses, etc....lol!  It's my cue to start thinking of reasons to stop the nonsense and get cracking.  True, it's a mind game but sometimes seeing my motives and outcomes set into another circumstance helps me to "re-think" my motive from how to plausibly avoid what's not convenient or pleasant to finding the thought that sets my mind in a better direction.  Does this happen to you as well?  What also helps me is remembering consequences (both internal and external....ahhh, the power of fear,guilt or shame) from the past I don't wish to repeat!  *blush*<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">A few years ago, I committed to going to bed by 11PM. Cute. The experiment failed. So I turned up the heat. I went to the bank, withdrew $200 (in $10 increments), and placed the stash near my window. Each night that I went to bed past 11PM, I threw $10 out of my window**. Within 4 days, my habit was set. <br><br>** Why not donate the $? The idea - which I borrowed from an article I read on lifehacker - loses it's power when the consequence is pleasant.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Avrum<br>Bless you!  My birthday is Thursday so I had placed $1,000 in my firesafe yet I couldn't think of anything I especially wanted.  I figured that I'd think of something come Thursday.<br>Well..............you have given me the BEST idea of what to give myself.  THANK YOU!<br>I have a horrible (to my mind anyway) project facing me and I was going to throw it into Mark's system, yet his new system has too much lag time for my shuffling feet.  *blush*<br>But your inspiration is GOLDEN!<br>I've taped a crisp $100 note to each of the ten pages in my planner.  If I complete > or = one hour on the dreaded project, I move the C note ten days hence.  Otherwise, it goes in my dog's poop bag when I next walk her.  (She a huge German Shepherd.  Just the thought of adding a step to the poop bagging process is aversive enough let alone it being my money that gets mingled into the mess!)<br>This kills two birds with one stone.  It gets me to stay steady in my resolve for 6 days running each week.  It also buys me time to think of something I want.  (No, I'm not filthy rich and have everything nor am I stupid.  Living in a bubble of pain simply changes my orientation of what I want.....which is usually some relief, food or sleep!)  Maybe this will also help me to learn how to ask for more out of my life and jump start some wants.  lol!<br>Of course, the effort required to carry out this mission may cause some of my other work to stalemate for awhile unless it's absolutely imperative.....<br>Wish me luck!  I KNOW that this will work.  In fact, knowing myself, I'll probably work on the awful project for much longer than an hour each day just to get it off my back and not have to fear the poop punishment!  LOL!  The dog is due for her Poop Patrol walk in 1'09' minutes or so.  I can't be cruel to her so I've got to get cracking!<br>Again, thank you so much!......Yet another reason why I love the folks here at the forum.  I learn so much!<br>learning as I go</div>

I'm 12 minutes into OT for Poop Patrol!  Maybe I should add that the hour MUST be done daily BEFORE Poop Patrol (about 2pm)</div>

<div class="content">I'm really enjoying reading the punishments you are creating for yourselves. Very funny! But seriously, rewards are much better long-term motivators. Of course, in our affluent culture, it's hard to find rewards as powerful as the punishments easily envisioned. That's why I tend to favor competition. It can easily be mixed with punishment/reward. Whoever doesn't do said goal pays the one who does. Or just leave it at bragging rights. I am benefiting from my 100 goals for 2010 competition with Jacqueline. Very motivating, especially when I see her making progress!</div>

<div class="content">Mel,<br><br>I would have thought the opposite.  I think punishment is much more effective when trying to break a very difficult habit.  I think rewards are called for when training, however.<br><br>Have you all heard of the double whammy?  That is where you don't throw the money away, but give it away to some cause you absolutely despise.  Someone even constructed an internet alarm clock, IIRC, where if you don't get up on time it automatically donates $10 to the Republican party or some such wretched outfit (assuming you think Republicans are wretched, of course ;-) ;-) ;-)</div>

<div class="content">What I think is missing from this new system was the factor introduced in AF4 ... you mark tasks for "review" then you have one day before they are dismissed.  More than once I have started something so that it would not be dismissed tomorrow.<br><br>Oh, to carry a thought forward from the US/UK thread... Mark, I love the phrase "done over".  I've not heard that in decades.  It is simply not used here.  I mentally hit a wall when I read that ... I thought you had screwed up your typing or something.  LOL ;-)</div>

<div class="content">I think I'll opt for a Someday List.<br> <br>"Dead, done for, dismissed, deceased," may be heading down the wrong path. One of the great beauties of AF is its reliance on our intuition and our desire to accomplish things. All this talk of punishment and being strict with ourselves goes against that beauty. And, I'm guessing, will have its own cost in distraction and loss of energy. Just put the task on the someday list and look at it once a month or once a year or forget about it and maybe stumble upon it again at the appropriate time. Get back to what you want to do, and can do, as quickly and naturally as possible. That's the most important thing.<br><br>FW</div>

<div class="content">Hi Avrum<br>Phew!  This dog bag only had poop!  When you said that you'd risk rummaging through poop to get the money, it reminded of a song by Bad Company.  It forgot the title, but it starts off with "If you want it, here it is. Come and get it but you'd better hurry cuz it may not last...."  There was a movie where a multi-millionaire filled his swimming pool full of poop.  He then proceeded to throw in tons of money into it!  While the people were diving in and frantically looking for the cash with the others' doing the same thing, it was a frenzied event! Those people also desperately fighting each other made the stench of greed compete with the obvious stench of the pool contents!  lol!   In the background they played the Bad Company's song!  ROTFL!  This movie was almost as bizarre as "Pink Flamingos"  lol!<br>This isn't about habits.  It's a one-time project.  One way or another I manage to stay above board....This is a novel twist that Avrum inspired!  lol!<br>learning as I go<br><br>p.s.  Good luck, Mel.  I hope you and Jacq tie!  I want both of you to win!</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>I've been in lots of competitions in my life.  My favorite is when I'm on a team.  Now-a-days my competing is with myself...........and dog poop!  I like to invent a game type atmosphere to challenge myself to get things mastered or done.  The easiest was is to formulate the goal and then track my input and/or progress.....It works great for learning something specific as well!  Back in the day, I had lines running through each day on my calendar each of a different color for all the things I was trying to master or get done!  I still do it for my monthly habit or for my project timelines.  <br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike<br>Yes, I tried that but I found myself not really hating anybody nearly as much as simply throwing away money that could be used toward some good or some pleasure.  Of course, I wouldn't know how to get money to a really bad group anyway!  Also, I'd be afraid of getting put on some FBI list and labelled as a bad guy myself.  How would I explain to the government why I'm sending $100 daily to some Neo-Natzi organization?<br>That's just too damn scary!  LOL!<br>learning as I go</div>

In practice, my Someday list grows, and grows, and grows. One more thing to maintain (or in my case, one LESS thing to maintain).</div>

<div class="content">Did anyone ever see a Twilight Zone or some other spooky type TV show where people who signed up to quit smoking were chased down and threatened and their relatives' fingers were chopped off if they smoked? lol <br><br>The problem with punishment is that eventually you adapt to the fear. You quit caring. While if you have the right reward, you'll work like a dog.<br><br>That's so sweet, Vickie. :-) I hope we both win, too. We've actually set it up so that if we accomplish 75% of our goals, we're both winners. Of course, I'll be fine with finishing more of mine than she does. rotfl I'm with you in trying to make a game out of getting things done. What i've learned though is that I do best with one big goal and to keep the feedback positive. That's why I struggled with AF which seemed to be more about what I had NOT gotten done than what I had.</div>

<div class="content">Hi all<br>Update: Feb 9 now has $500 attached to the page.  Now I can breath a bit and not worry about a pain bout.  Now that I've got some breathing room, I can do this better!  *blush*  Plus, I've decided to keep it restricted to office hours except one or two days a week I'm allowed to crunch hard like I did today.  I realize that I don't want lousy work to bleed into my sacred leisure hours!  lol!  I can't be sure but it feels like this will do the trick.  <br><br>Mel, I think the movie you're talking about was a Stephen King movie comprised of a few of his short stories...but...don't trust my memory!  LOL!<br>I think it's smart that you and Jacq instituted the 75% win goal.  That allows for some real challenge yet is still doable!  I'm sure if you complete more goals than Jacq, she'll gladly congratulate you!  You both seem to make a great support system!<br><br>This is the weirdest spin I've ever placed upon my current initiative!  LOL!

<div class="content">U-propdate:<br>Feb 10 now has $100 attached.  I woke up at 4:02 to get it out of the way.  I'm grateful that my pain levels are low enough so far today.  I'll have to see how this plays out.  I'm sure that it will work but at what price?  lol!  At this rate, the damn thing might get finished enough on my end.  I'm not going to risk my money on the waiting for others to do their part aspect of it!  I'm not that confident of their consciensiousness!  lol!  But, maybe I can still use the money motive to force me to properly follow up rather than allow them to linger too long.  (I HATE having to remind folks of what they should already be doing.  Fingers crossed that this aspect won't be too anxiety provoking!  I need to sharpen this skill anyway!  lol!)<br>This will be my last update ....................unless I FAIL a day!

<div class="content">Hi Avrum<br>I don't suffer from any illness.  I suffer from permanent injuries from an auto wreck.  I have spinal cord and periferal nerve damage and a damaged neck and spine.  I also have permaent brain injuries.  I won't disclose the psychological challenges that I'm still working on.  Even after the surguries and over a year and a half of both physical therapy and a year of cognitive reconstruction and six months of biofeedback and anything else the shrinks and docs wanted to try out on me (can't remember them all.  I had several doctors and shrinks).  I'm MUCH improved and I am grateful.......yet, much is still broken or not working correctly!  The worst challenge is a tie between the brain injuries and the debilitating pain from the spinal cord damage!  It sometimes feels like a hot poker burning in my neck or sometimes it feels like a stun gun.  During those times, I'm an amoeba!  LOL!  The rest of the time, I do my best.  ROTFL!  When I get to self-pitying, I remember I'm at least ambulatory if a bit wobbly, and at least I'm alive to feel any pain at all!  ROTFL!  Most of this is playing around with my mind to think better of things.  Focusing heavily on relative gratitudes usually does the best good.  Using twisted humor also helps to re-orient my thinking.  I'm slowly learning not to compare my past self with my present self.  That can be a downer if I don't stop it quick enough.  *blush*  The social isolation is a bitch as well.  Contrary to lip service,  most folks don't like to be around disabled people too much.  Ironically, it's the ones who knew the previous me that avoid me the most now.....I guess I'm too slow and stupid to be running with my old crowd!  ROTFL!<br>Overall, I'm trucking along OK enough!  LOL!  Plus, I have optimism in the advancements of medical research.  Heck, maybe one day they'll cut out the damaged spinal cord sections and the other damaged nerves and hook a mini-computer into my brain and I'll be back on the slopes and reclaiming my position with my career!  Hey....it could happen!  LOL!<br>learning as I go</div>

I experienced and accomplshed more than I could ever have imagined using the system my dad taught me!  He accomplished a lot and was a great human being as well.

Those things never end thank goodness!  <br>Please understand that I'm NOT criticising Mark's systems.  It's just that I always needed to live out of a calendar while being ready to grasp unforeseen opportunities.  I always had lots of plates spinning.  Otherwise, I'd get restless.
