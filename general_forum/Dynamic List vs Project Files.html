<div class="content">Hi Mark -- <br><br>When working on a project, in what situations do you (you personally, not you in general) use a Dynamic List, and in what situations do you work off a project plan or detailed project files?<br><br>I imagine it would usually be something like this:<br>1. Decide to work on Project A.<br>2. Make a Dynamic List of stuff to do for Project A.<br>3. The Dynamic List may (or may not) include something like "Check project notes to see what's next".<br>4. Work the Dynamic List.  <br>5. Refer to the project notes whenever prompted when working the Dynamic List.<br>6. Discover that most of the work gets done simply by working the Dynamic List without referring to the project files at all.<br>7. Throw away the Dynamic List at the end of the day.<br><br>I'm guessing your primary use of your project files is to keep track of relevant information (like phone numbers, invoices, records, etc.), but can also be used for tracking project deliverables, schedule, deadlines, etc.<br><br>But of course I am just speculating, and would really like to know how you manage this kind of thing.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br>I'd normally only have a project plan if I was coordinating the efforts of a number of people or if I needed approval for what I proposed to do. At present I'm writing a marketing plan for a men's association and a legacy fundraising plan for a church.<br><br>For something which is for me on my own, such as this website, selling books and articles, etc. I would rely exclusively on questioning techniques such as 5 questions, cumulative lists of subjects, and dynamic lists.<br><br>My "project files" usually consist of a notebook (or even just a tag) in Evernote. But of course I keep all papers that need to be archived.<br><br>My blog article tomorrow may go some way towards further answering your question.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Mark - this makes a lot of sense.  And as others have mentioned, it's always helpful to see this extra level of detail in how you practically implement your systems.</div>
