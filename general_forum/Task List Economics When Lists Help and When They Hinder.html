<div class="content">After years of experimenting with various task management systems, I've come to realize that the true value of a task list lies in its economy – using it only for things that genuinely benefit from external tracking.<br><br>## The Functional vs. Aspirational Divide<br><br>I believe task lists work best when they serve very clear, functional purposes rather than acting as repositories for everything we wish to accomplish. Here's how I distinguish between what belongs on a list and what doesn't:<br><br>### What Deserves List Space:<br><br>1. **Calendar appointments** - Meetings and time-specific commitments that involve coordination with others<br>2. **Repeatable processes** - Checklists for procedures you'll need to reproduce exactly (like month-end accounting procedures)<br>3. **Genuine memory supplements** - Things you would actually forget without an external reminder (project deadlines, birthdays)<br>4. **Functional reminders** - Items with specific parameters that would otherwise slip through the cracks<br><br>### What Probably Doesn't:<br><br>1. **Daily habits** - Things like "exercise" or "meditate" that are better driven by internal motivation<br>2. **Aspirational items** - Vague intentions that represent wishes rather than concrete tasks<br>3. **Routine personal care** - Tasks like "brush teeth" that are already automated in your life<br>4. **Random tasks without context** - Items that aren't tied to deadlines, checklists, important reminders, or projects that give them meaning<br><br>## The Hidden Cost of Aspirational Lists<br><br>When we load our task systems with aspirational items, we transform potentially enjoyable activities into obligations. The list becomes a source of pressure rather than support.<br><br>What's worse, these wish-list items tend to remain perpetually undone, creating a backlog of guilt. We then spend mental energy maintaining and migrating these items from system to system, creating more overhead than value.<br><br>## A More Economical Approach<br><br>I've found greater success by keeping my formal lists extremely economical – limited to only those items that have clear functional utility. Everything else is allowed to flow from internal motivation, environmental cues, and natural rhythm.<br><br>This doesn't mean abandoning aspirational activities – it simply means not forcing them into the same management system as concrete, well-defined tasks.<br><br>## The Problem with Someday/Maybe Lists<br><br>I've come to agree with Mark's perspective on "someday/maybe" lists. Initially reluctant to let go of this concept, I now realize these lists often grow into unmanageable monsters that create more mental burden than benefit.<br><br>When a project or task doesn't serve a clear purpose right now, it's better to trust your brain's natural filtering system. The truly important ideas will resurface when the time is right, while the rest can peacefully fade away without generating guilt or administrative overhead.<br><br>Rather than maintaining an ever-growing backlog of potential futures, this approach allows your natural interests and priorities to guide what comes into focus.<br><br>## Finding Balance<br><br>The essence of efficient task management isn't capturing everything but being selective about what deserves external tracking. By keeping lists economical—focused only on items with clear utility—we transform them from sources of obligation into genuinely helpful tools.<br><br>This balanced approach honors both our planning needs and our natural tendencies. It creates space for both structure and spontaneity. Most importantly, it puts the task system back in its proper place: serving us, rather than the other way around.</div>

<div class="content">I like your ideas here. What I sometimes personally struggle with is the initial distinction between "put it on a list" and "don't put it on a list". <br><br>I find it easier to "go all in" by either... <br><br>1) writing it all (capture anything without hesitation, to be dismissed or done later), or <br><br>2) writing nothing (in which I include classic No-List, where I only write one next thing which I immediately start). <br><br>I find that when I take a middle ground, I have a little harder time because I first have to decide if I write it or not. That executive function use is just enough friction to make me not write things I should, or not fully trust my intuition. <br><br>Have you experienced anything like that?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Scott,<br><br>I agree with what you are saying. I also struggle with these concepts and am flipping between the two. My thoughts were a way for me to reconcile the two. I get the allure of no list/time surfing, but also see the point in getting all your tasks on a list.<br><br>The problem I see with time surfing (or no list) is that it is not really always a no list. You always need to have a calendar (which is just a list with dates), so the idea of no list is for me more a romantic idea than something practical. But it still has value.<br><br>With catching it all, you get stuff off your mind and this provides some mental relief, but only temporary as that list of things comes back and eats at you in a quite oppressive way. Then we end up spending a lot of time on how to manage this beast, while also thinking that do I really need to have this list of items when most of the time, I just know what to do.<br><br>I guess the issue also becomes, do you want a list to tell you what to do or do you yourself want to decide now what to do. I think it fundamentally goes to trust. Do I trust myself to know what to do?<br><br>I do think there is value to just write things down as they appear, but this is almost like an email inbox which you need to clear. You need to ask is this thing I am writing down really a task that I need to do. Or is it just a fuzzy list of ideas, wishlists etc. that I am not realistically tackling right now. This is best to leave to your mind to filter out and you need to trust that your mind will do a better filtering of this process.<br><br>So for me the following is an illustration. During the day I might capture the following on a paper notebook on my desk:<br><br>* Fix roof<br>* Learn python<br>* Add line "add team member" to project "recruitment process"<br>* Check emails<br>* Read fiction book<br>* Publish report by next Monday<br><br>Item 1 - goes into due soon task list<br>Item 2 - this goes nowhere. Your brain must decide when you want to do this<br>Item 3 - Into project folder<br>Item 4 - this is useless. You would naturally know when to check emails<br>Item 5 - useless item to be discarded. Read the book when you feel it is right. A list should not tell you<br>Item 6 - This is on your to do list with a due date. It has the same importance as a calendar entry and is the truest form of task list and has a very clear utility.<br><br>So, maybe writing stuff down feels cathartic, but then you need to ensure your list is economical and decide if it really needs to be on the list. I feel it takes a bit more effort at the start to make this distinction, but the outcome is that you are working on what you have decided and not leaving it to a list to dictate to you.<br><br>My thoughts are however fluid on this.</div>

Otherwise, your intuition will not be primed to do the things that you need/want to do.</div>

<div class="content">Avrum:<br><br>Good points.<br><br>I think the meditating topic is worth exploring. In practice I think it is how this should be done.<br><br>Let's say the worst case of working is the following:<br>- Open your emails and just start working on whatever is being served up by your inbox.  So basically, you have little agency and is just waiting for work to come to you.  Basically drifting.  This I view as the worst style of working, even though I do it sometimes when I am just low in motivation.<br><br>Oppose this to: Without looking at your emails or any inboxes.  You check in with yourself and ask what is the best thing to do now? Maybe the meditation lies here.  Maybe the answer is still then "Process emails", but you have taken away the auto-pilot mode and are intentional in what you want to do.</div>

<div class="content">It's hard to make good decisions -- consciously or with intuition -- without good information. Getting that information is urgent and important.<br><br>"Look at inbox subject lines to see if it needs triaging." Based on that, you might decide that actually triaging the inbox is also urgent and important. (I often do them in the same step, but sometimes need to separate them.)<br><br>"Make roadmap for the week and one possible route through it." That tells me how much flexibility I have for the week. Again, having that information will improve the decisions.</div>

<div class="content">I will include those ones the original poster omits, except not the routine items.  But I employ outline structuring to make the aspirational items not clutter the active items, and I use the outline also to make so they arent just aspirations, but rather ideas I actively develop as i encounter them in the lists.<br><br>“Learn python” - i can start outlining what I want to be learning at least, and file that away under “Learning” for activation when I’m not filled up learning other things.<br>“Check email” - I actually don’t naturally check them all the time.  This is complicated by having too many other sources of info I also need to check.  So noting the things to check allows me to be deliberate and not constantly randomly checking something.<br>“Read book” is useless. “Read Crime and Punishment” reminds me that I have commited to get through this book because otherwise I might forget to get back to it after a week of being too busy to look at novels.</div>
