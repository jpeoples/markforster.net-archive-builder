<div class="content">Hi  mark and everyone, I'm not sure if this has already been asked, but what if I scan a page and can't do any of the items becuase I am not in the right time or place?  eg, at the moment the items left on the page I am working on are:<br><br>repair hole in bathroom floor ( itsa bit late in the evening to be tackiling something like this.  I'm wondering whetherr this task is worth doing or should I wait until I get the bathroom refitted - intended for later this year)<br>repaint iron gate ( its dark and wet outside - impossible)<br>pay credit card (its not payday til tomorrow so I have no funds to do this online. I suppose I could write a cheque and post it. It oiccurs to me I should have this as a scheduled task in my diary.  Prior to AF it was a scheduled task in my PDA with a date attached to it)<br>internet shop ( I don't need to do this for another week or two.  this could be another scheduled task, or I could just delete it and add it to the end of the list when I think it needs doing)<br>watercolour painting ( I put this on as a means to encourage me to do more leisurely things, but right now, I just don't feel like it!)<br><br>I don't want to dismiss all of these items, but I think I could dismiss one or more of them.  Is this allowed and does the system then permit me to move onto the next page? or does moving an item to a my diary count as dealing with something?  Any ideas as I have had this problem crop up on a few occasions beforein the last couple of weeks and I become paralysed with indecision!<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">I believe you need to dismiss them all, or none of them. Why not get those watercolours out ready for when you feel like it? That would count as working towards that task, so you can cross it out, reenter it on the last page, and move on to the next page.</div>

<div class="content">If it's not possible to do any of the tasks on the page because it's not the right time, place, or conditions, then I think the "common sense" rule would apply--just move on to the next page. Right, Mark?</div>

<div class="content">The risk with the common sense" rule is that you might keep coming back to the page and it still isn't the right time to do any of them (eg now it is too hot to repaint the gate).</div>

<div class="content">Genuinely being too hot to paint (because the paint will dry too fast or there is a real risk of sun stroke or heat exhaustion) is common sense. But if it's just another way of making an excuse not to point, it's resistance--which would be useful to confront and, if possible, resolve.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Maybe it would be best to rephrase the task to: Check to see if the temperature is right and if so, paint gate. Now it can be moved to the end of the list if the conditions are not right.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Carole<br><br>I've just updated the FAQ's post which gives links to a lot of the common questions that we're all coming up with.  There are a number of threads that may help you <br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/645945" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/645945</a><br><br>Hope that is of help .....<br></div>

<div class="content">Carole:<br><br>Normally tasks won't get to the dismissal stage until you've had multiple opportunities to do them and haven't. <br><br>Therefore my choice would be to dismiss the items. Bear in mind that dismissing an item is not the end of that item for ever but a time to evaluate why it's not been done.</div>

<div class="content">Carole, for all of this items I would try to think about why being in control and not being controlled is often more  important to us than doing something positive and pleasant for ourselves, especially the watercolour painting .<br></div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the replies all of which have been helpful!<br><br>I have decided to put cyclical tasks such as paying bills as a scheduled item in my diary (which could be added to the list when they crop up)<br><br>LOL I totally the get "it will never be the right time" theory - its easy to see how procrastination can creep into the system if you don't have the threat of dismissal!<br><br>I can see how some  of the tasks could be broken down, eg I could make sure that I have got sufficient hammerite paint for the gate for when the weather gets brighter, so I am ready with the tools for the job - otherw ise I might have another excuse for not doing it! ( I suspect what little I have left in the tin I used last time has dried up!)<br><br>Also I need to think about whether I am letting my list dominate my life and whether I am getting enough leisure time!<br><br>Finally, I will dismiss items on a page when I really cannot  take a small step towards doing them or will not do any of them at the time.<br><br>Carole</div>

<div class="content">Hi Carole<br><br>If you add some fun things on to your list then you not only make sure you are getting your leisure time but also can be "leisurely" without the guilt feelings of "I should be doing something else"!<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Mark and others<br><br>sorry to resurrect this thread - and this may already have been asked - but I was wondering if a single item on a page can be dismissed/crossed off rather than actioned if it is a task that is no longer necessary, has already been actioned,  you can't remember why you wanted to do it, or worse,you can't understand what it was that you wrote down!<br><br>I have been doing this, but I have started to wonder whether this is cheating the system - especially if you use it as a means to get off that page where there might actiually be other tasks that you know you should be doing, but want to procrastiniate one more time!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Carole<br><br>What I have done/would do in those situations is as follows:<br><br>has already been actioned - cross it off<br>you can't remember why you wanted to do it - dismiss it<br>you can't understand what it was that you wrote down! - dismiss it<br>if it is a task that is no longer necessary - (a) cross it off if it is just that circumstances have changed (b) dismiss it if you have taken an alternative action<br><br>The reason I would dismiss some of those items rather than cross off, is to provide an overview of the type of tasks I am dismising - and also i may later remeber the importance etc when reviewing dismissed items.<br><br>It is important to remember that you do not dismiss odd items before the page is finished - you dismiss all or none.<br><br>As to the procrastination issue - if I have already done one of the items and cross it off I do treat that as my action on the page - I will have to go back to that page and make a decision next time around so do not really see that as procrastinating.  Hope that helps!<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Carole:<br><br>Yes, I do that all the time!<br><br>I have always regarded a decision that one is not going to do a task at all (for whatever reason) as an acceptable form of action on the task.</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br>Thanks - at least I don't feel now I'm cheating the system!<br><br>Christine:<br>One of the problems I have had with the system is wanting to dismiss an item, but not the whole page with it.  I guess from Mark's response,  the anwer is that  deleting  a task is classed as an action ( phew) as is ticking it off because its already been done.  You're saying the item stays undismissed if I don't want to action it in some way, until it is dismissed along with all the other dismissed items on the page. I get it now. So I can't cheat in those circumstances!<br><br>On reflection, I think I am trying to procrastinate dismissing items, without actually progressing them!  That *is* cheating!  :-)</div>

<div class="content">It's funy isn't it how we tie ourselves up in knots trying to somehow cheat the system before we finally give in and say "ok, ok, I'm procrastinating!"  Regarding leaving the "to be dismissed" item until the whole page is dismissed - I tried dismissing one item on a page when there were other items outstanding but the fact that there was a highlighted item on an open page proved incredibly distracting when scanning that page and inhibited the "flow" of AF.  So much so in fact that I actually rewrote the page (sad huh?)</div>
