<div class="content">I haven't implemented this quite yet, but I came up with this idea while out walking this morning.<br><br>Little history...<br>I started AF in February and am currently on my 60th page.  I am now down to 6 active pages and trying to keep it at that number so that my earliest tasks were entered from 3-5 days ago.<br><br>This means whenever I get to "review dismissed tasks" on my active list, I have to go back through 54 pages to look at them all.  That's starting to become a bit unwieldy, even if they are highlighted.<br><br>My proposal is to create a second list of those dismissed items...meaning that I will highlight them to dismiss them from the active page, but then I will re-write the task onto a separate "Dismissed" list in my notebook.  Now when it's time to review, I can scan that dismissed list much like I would scan my AF lists.  If I pick something out of the list, I can mark it off the dismissed list and move it to the active list.  I was also thinking that I could treat the dismissed list like I would treat the lists in AF2 by "drawing the line" on the first item (not blocks because that could be too huge of a chunk) and deciding either to make it active or decide never to do it.  Also, when I review I look for things to cross off as "never do" when they become irrelevant or completed by other means.  So the dismissed lists gets shortened over time and eventually completed pages can be tossed.<br><br>Would like to hear what others are doing about long lists of dismissed items.  Does this make sense or am I making more work for myself?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Gretchen,<br><br>I think you might be making some busy work for yourself.  The general experience here is that dismissed items come up again on thier own so nothing is lost by just forgetting about them.<br><br>I find this procedure works for me:<br><br>- An idea comes to mind<br><br>- I write in on the AF list<br><br>- I immediately challenge it.  IOW, I ask: "Am I committed to doing this task within a week?"<br><br>- If yes, I leave it alone<br><br>- If no, I dismiss it immediately<br><br>- At weeks end, during my review, I go through my list and either move dismissed items to an appropriate project list or a more general "someday/maybe" list and that is reviewed weekly for anything that might be worth doing.  Mostly stuff just stays there.<br><br>My reasoning is that I want to keep the AF list small and fast.  I don't do much in the way of processing.<br><br>As to deleting those you will never do, why not just scratch them out when you decide that they will not be done.  No need for a complex system to manage it.</div>
