<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2011-03-3 4:20</div>
<div class="content">SF3 is a fantastic system. However, I have two reasons why SF3 won't work for me. 1) I have more unfinished projects and urgent items than I have new items entering the list, so column 2 fills up too quickly, and 2) my hand cramps if I write a lot and with SF3 there is more rewriting than with any earlier AF version. (I have some recurring items, but they are few.)<br><br>Until a little more than a month ago, I had been working with an adaptation of AF1. I wrote a post about my Flagged Tasks adaptation of AF1 in another thread.<br><br>With my former tweak of AF1 I had slowly become concerned about the amount of rewriting I was doing, because of the amount of unfinished projects I had (each having a number of unfinished tasks within them). I pretty much liked everything else about the system. It really helped me handle the vast quantity of work that I have to do.<br><br>Because of the hand cramping problem, I came up with another tweak that I briefly mentioned in a post several weeks ago. I actually started it before I went on a cruise and I have used it since returning. After the cruise I had a pile of work and I had a lot of catching up to do. This was a good stress test for the system and it came through in flying colors.<br><br>So, if for any reason you can't use or don't like SF3, then I offer this new tweak of AF1 as an alternative.<br><br>1) Use a ruled notebook for task management, where tasks or names of projects are written on every other line.<br><br>2) Keep the associated tasks of a project together in some other location - also written on every other line. I leave the location up to you.<br><br>3) First thing in the morning (or the last thing at night), review all tasks and projects. Place a reusable Post-It Arrow Flag on any task THAT MUST BE DONE TODAY. (Note: This is different from the way I used to do it. I used to flag what stood out. Now the criterion is much stricter: only tasks that must be done today. So, the number of flags has been drastically reduced.)<br><br>4) If there is a flag on a task in your project list, then the name of the project listed in the task management notebook is flagged as well.<br><br>5) Cycle through the flagged tasks / project names in your task management notebook. <br><br>6) Work on tasks / project names as they 'stand out'.<br><br>7) When as much work as is going to be done on a task / project name, then remove the flag and return it to the holding place. (For me it is the inside cover of the notebook.)<br><br>8) If the task / project name is completed, scratch the item through.<br><br>9) If the task / project name is not completed, then write the date on the line below, using the format MDD. For example, 302 (March second) or 1013 (October thirteenth).<br><br>10) When all the flags are removed, then return to the page last worked on during the prior day. I mark the last page I worked on with a reusable Post-It flag at the very top of the page. (As I move to a new page to work, I move the Post-It flag to the top of that page.)<br><br>11) When first arriving at a page, quickly review all the tasks as Mark has talked about doing. Then, cycle through the tasks / project names and action any that stand out.<br><br>12) If a page contains any task / project name that has a date in the line below it (meaning it is an unfinished task that has been worked on before), then it must be actioned again before leaving the page. (This is somewhat similar to SF3.) (Note: there are exceptions to this rule that I will mention later.)<br><br>13) If a project name stands out, then go to the list of associated tasks for the project. Quickly review the task list. Cycle through the tasks and action any that stand out. <br><br>14) If the project task list has any task with a date in the line below it, then it must be actioned again before leaving the project list.<br><br>Exceptions to the Must Be Actioned Rule<br><br>1) If you combine personal and work tasks / project names in your task management notebook (as I do), then a personal task doesn't have to be actioned during work hours and a work task doesn't have to be actioned after-hours .... it may be actioned, it just doesn't have to be.<br><br>2) If the task cannot be done, then it doesn't have to be actioned. For example, some tasks may be started, but then need a contingency fulfilled in order to continue. If that contingency or condition hasn't been met and you cannot action the task again, it is alright to go to the next page (provided, of course, there are no remaining unfinished tasks to action on that page.)<br><br>Rewriting Rules<br><br>1) If the line underneath a task / project name has no more room to write dates, then it is scratched through and rewritten at the end of the list. On the line beneath the rewritten task / project name is a circled number followed by a date. The circled number is the number of dates that were previously under it and the date is the last date of the prior listing of the task.<br><br>2) If a page only has recurring tasks on it, then they are scratched through and rewritten at the end of the list using the same method as above.<br><br>3) If a page only has one unfinished task / project name remaining, then it is scratched through and rewritten similarly at the end of the list.<br><br>Dismissal Rules<br><br>1) If no action is done on a page, then the remaining items are dismissed for later review and possible reinstatement.<br><br>2) If at any time an unfinished task can be actioned, but actioning it is causing you to bog down or become inefficient in important work, then it should be dismissed. It just isn't time to do this task. A later review might reinstate it at a more reasonable time.<br><br>So, that's my method. I have been doing this for several weeks, and it fits me perfectly. I hope it might help someone else, or perhaps spark an idea in them of how they can personalize a system to their particular personality.<br><br>Matt</div>

<div class="content">In this post I'd like to explain some of the benefits of this system.<br><br>First, and foremost, important work gets done. The flags ensure that I will tackle what needs to be done first pop out of the box.<br><br>Second, because there isn't a lot of rewriting, you actually get to see how much progress you are truly making and how fast (or how slow) you are making it.<br><br>Other benefits in no particular order: <br><br>The number of pages don't get out of control as they did under AF1. <br><br>There is an SF3-like increased impetus to finish a task once what you've started it. I must say that I didn't experience this in my previous method. <br><br>You arrive at dismissal decisions more quickly. <br><br>To me it seems like I get to adjustments in my management more quickly than with any other method.<br><br>Since there are less tasks on a page, there is less opportunity to pick an easy task. A page reduces down to important tasks more quickly.<br><br>I'm sure there are some more, but it's late and I have a big day tomorrow. I'll post as I have time.<br><br>Matt</div>

<div class="content">Matt - Ditto to what David Drake said!<br><br>For myself I want to stick with my SAFv3 urgent-goes-in-C2-next-page experiment and see how that goes.  Also, I'm afraid putting flags on things would make me NOT EVER take action on them.  (Just knowing the way my mind works...)<br><br>But please do keep us updated on your progress with this -- others have already mentioned that they have been using your last 25-flag system, and I'm sure many of them will find your new invention works for them even better, as you have.</div>

<div class="content">I just got back from my nightly late-night walk with my dog. While out, I thought of two additional things to add.<br><br>1) One of the benefits of flagging tasks is the positive feedback I get pulling the flag off of a task.<br><br>2) I haven't counted my tasks, but I have a Seraphim-like number. For example, as a Fair Market Value consultant I have discrete projects, and I have pre-printed project cards with 40 general tasks that are repeated for every project. The majority of them are multi-step tasks. In addition, I have space to write in tasks as the projects progresses and takes a life of its own. I have anywhere from 5 simultaneous projects to 30. I currently have 12.  In addition to my work, because I want to be in business for myself, I have several businesses. Each of these are in various states of operation. Each have numerous multi-step projects. Plus I have all of my personal projects. Having moved into this house one year ago, I still have unfinished projects. So, for this season in my life I am VERY BUSY. Recently I worked 32 out of 36 hours. I currently work from the time I get up until I go to bed. I get a few respites in the form of "The Office" and daily reruns of "Curb Your Enthusiasm" as I eat lunch. If it weren't for my daily prayer and devotional in the morning, I would probably explode. Oh, did I forget to mention the HoneyDo's? So, I haven't counted my discrete tasks recently, but it's up there. The way I've managed it is by collecting related tasks into projects and only putting the project name into the task management notebook.<br><br>Ok, that's it. I hope it helps provide background on the system.<br><br>Matt</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim,<br><br>After I posted my latest, I saw that you posted.

I wanted to see how it worked. My progress has been fantastic.<br><br>Please see my other post, where I confirm that I have Seraphim-like numbers of tasks and the system is handling it.<br><br>Matt</div>

<div class="content">Hi Matt - thanks so much for sharing your system. <br><br>I liked your flagging idea a lot when you first posted it, but surprisingly, I found that the flags got in the way. Unlike you, I don't get the "completion kick" from peeling them off.  But obviously, that is just me and not the system.<br><br>On the new rules, I can't help thinking the pre-filtered today tasks may result in some unintended results. Priorities shift during the day, and what's important in the morning may not be so later in the day. What happens then? Do you remove the flags? If you do that often enough, you may start distrusting your system and build up resistance to these tasks.</div>

<div class="content">Hi JD!<br><br>>  I found that the flags got in the way.<br><br>I'm not sure I understand what you mean. Let's take a look at the old system first.<br><br>My old Flagged Tasks system:<br>1) Flag everything that stands out during your daily review.<br>2) Cycle through those Flagged Tasks ONLY; working on the Flagged Tasks in the order that they stand out to you.<br>3) Work on a Flagged Task, remove it.<br>4) Since the Flagged Tasks are like a closed list on a single page, once you've done all that stand out, you can go on to the next "page." But, since they aren't really a page, you can remove any remaining flags that you overzealously flagged in the beginning of the day, if there are no remaining flagged tasks that are standing out. (In my experience, I never did over-flag, but I did allow for that in the rules. In my experience I completed all the flagged tasks.)<br>5) Once you've finished working on the Flagged Tasks, there are no flags on your list. You go back to working AF1-style.<br><br>So, with the old system I don't see how the flags could get in the way. Perhaps your tasks or workload is such a way that it would happen. But, it never happened for me.<br><br>My new system:<br>1) Flag **O-N-L-Y** tasks that must be actioned today. This is a much smaller number of flags.<br>2) Cycle ONLY through these few-in-number must-be-actioned tasks; working on the Flagged Tasks in the order that they stand out to you.<br>3) Work on a Flagged Task, remove it.<br>4) Once you've finished actioning the Flagged must-be-actioned Tasks, there will be no flags in the notebook. Work the notebook according to the other rules.<br><br>So, with the new system – like the old system – there are never any flags in the notebook to get in the way of the other tasks. They have all been removed according to the rules before you get to them.<br><br>> On the new rules, I can't help thinking the pre-filtered today <br>> tasks may result in some unintended results. Priorities shift <br>> during the day<br><br>I think something dramatic would have to happen for a must-be-actioned today task to suddenly NOT need to be actioned. Remember, the rule for flagging tasks is NOT to flag a task-I'd-like-to-action-today, but rather MUST-be-actioned-today.<br><br>I haven't run across that problem, but if I did, I would remove the flag of a must-be-actioned task, because I have done work on it, by changing the value of the task to reflect the new reality. I'd also add a Flagged Task, if I got a call, for example, with a task that must be done today. I'd write it in and flag it, and it would be done. I haven't run across this happening yet either, but it could happen. And, that is how I would handle it.<br><br>> Unlike you, I don't get the "completion kick" from peeling <br>> them off. But obviously, that is just me and not the system.<br><br>Well, it could be that you are the normal one and I'm the abnormal one. I do get a positive feedback by removing flags. And, I get a really positive feedback when I remove the last flag. Probably just a quirk of mine – I've never really been accused of being normal! <br>:-)<br><br>Thanks, JD.<br><br>Matt</div>

<div class="content">That's a good idea, Alan. I'm sure lots of SF3 users would benefit from that.<br><br>For me, I can't do the constant rewriting. So, I'm sticking with my almost completely rewrite-free method.<br><br>Thanks, Alan.<br><br>Matt</div>

<div class="content">I suppose it's a psychological quirk.   <br><br>If I time-block (not an actual meeting with other people, but a block of time intended for me to work on something specific), I will ALWAYS work on something other than what I intended.<br><br>If I flag something, my attention will be drawn automatically to the things I *didn't* flag.  <br><br>Maybe it's just the habit of procrastination taking a particularly perverse form.<br><br>Maybe it's something more.  Maybe it's the contrarian in me.   You know, if everyone says BUY then I'm the one who wants to SELL.   If someone says "Look at this!!!   It's really important!!!", I am apt to ignore half of that and look around on the periphery for the REAL answer.    <br><br>I'm NOT saying any of this is right.  I am just saying that this is what I often find myself doing.   <br><br>Sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesn't.<br><br>For example, when viewing power point slides, I never read the headers.  They always seem to be empty jibberish.   Same with magazine articles.   <br><br>I've missed some pretty important information doing that.    :-)     But I've also avoided having to read lots of jibberish.   :-)<br><br>Anyway, I hope that helps explain why flags don't work for me.   I'm sure they work for people who aren't quite so messed up as me.    :-)</div>

<div class="content"><<So, with the old system I don't see how the flags could get in the way>><br><br>Hello Matt: I think the real issue was not that they got in the way as much as I didn't think it necessary because "standing out" was a more flexible dynamic. The flag overlay added a review process that was not really necessary for me.<br><br>For example, there were times when things just came at me, so I spent a chunk of time just quickly writing and doing the tasks at the end of the list. But it was important that the system allowed me to do that, then with AF1 and now more so with SF. <br><br>The act of removing flags, putting them away, then re-writing, broke down for me when things came thick and fast. And that's when I realised they were not really that important, because the standing out process dealt with them adequately.<br><br>Furthermore, at work, I have fewer task to deal with that take a long time to complete, so flagging became superfluous when there was a limited set of tasks to choose from.<br><br>In the final analysis, it has more to do with the kind of work I do, rather than the system itself, as you say.</div>
