<div class="content">The exercises in "Dreams" and GED are what could be best replaced with a long list system, in the sense that either one is suffice. <br><br>DIT is anathema to the long list, because the aim is to get everything done that is entered into the system, whereas the long list wants to dismiss items as part of the plan. <br><br>"Secrets" is pretty system agnostic. So I'd go with "Secrets." It features a no list system but you can replace this with a long list just fine.</div>

<div class="content">Christopher: << DIT is anathema to the long list >><br><br>Maybe true. But, for what it's worth, I think the following "long-list DIT" system would be possible:<br><br>1. Simple Scanning rules<br>2. Leave a blank line at the beginning of each day and write today's date (as in DWM2).<br>3. By the end of each day, try your best to clear all of yesterday's tasks (and all tasks from days earlier than yesterday).<br>4. If you fall 3 days or so behind, do an audit to see what's wrong (as in DIT).<br>5. If you're hopelessly behind, declare a backlog (as in DIT) and work on some of that every day.<br><br>Lately, I've been attracted to Real Autofocus and DWM2, and this seems to be in the same ballpark. Obviously, this is pretty different from the original DIT though (there is no buffer keeping you from tomorrow's tasks, and so on). I'm sure Mark tested many DIT variants back in the day.</div>
