<div class="content">Hi Mark! <br><br>It's great to finally have a look at your new autofocus system! I like where you're coming from and can immediately how it can be easy to pick up. <br><br>Just a quick question and clarification: how does the autofocus method deal with outstanding tasks that depend on others? An example would be a team leader waiting for all the inputs from his team members before collating the final report. Since there is nothing for the team leader to action on per se, except perhaps to send reminders (if appropriate), how should he enter this into the full list of action items? <br><br>I'm wondering if there should be a separate list with a heading like "outstanding tasks from others"? If so, do you feel that there's limit to the number of separate lists/notebooks one should manage? <br><br>Just thought you'd be interested: I'll be trying Autofocus out on Evernote (<a href="http://evernote.com/)." rel="nofollow">http://evernote.com/).</a> I'll be posting my thoughts here too.</div>

<div class="content">Adrian <br><br>In this case I would put a reminder in Outlook (or whatever system I'm using) to check at a specific date whether I'd received the reports. When the reminder came up I would then enter it in the main task list.<br><br>The relevant section of the instructions is:<br><br>"DO use some means of bringing forward tasks which can only be done at a future date (Tickler file, Outlook reminders, Calendar, etc.)"<br><br>However if a task is only going to be a few days, I wouldn't bother to put a reminder. Instead I'd just leave a task in the main task list: "Bill replied re widget production figures?", "Reports received from team?". Since most pages are active for several days, that can quite happily sit there as an unactioned task until you think it's time to take some action on it..</div>

<div class="content">For tracking items needing feedback from others -- if you sent an email originally, I've found it helpful to tag the "Sent Item" with a follow-up flag.  I have a "Search Folder" setup that lets me look at all flagged items, and I can simply check that folder once a day to review for any items needing a reminder.<br><br>Couple notes:<br><br>1. I tag the item *after* I've sent it, so the recipient doesn't see the follow-up flag.<br><br>2. I tend to file items right away after sending, but if you leave outgoing items in your "Sent Items" folder, you might try a Search Folder that includes all iitems in your Inbox AND your Sent Items folder, grouped by topic/subject and sorted by date received.  Once a reply does come in, the original sent item automatically gets grouped with the reply, so you can see it was flagged for a response and mark the flag complete.<br><br>- Kevin</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Kevin - that is a GREAT idea and something I will try out!<br><br>It is so easy to get things lost in the barrage of emails.........</div>
