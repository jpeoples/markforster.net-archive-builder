<div class="content">I haven't seen a lot of excitement yet about SuperFocus. Probably because it's new, and probably also because everyone already has a good enough system. So no need to get excited, right?<br><br>Wrong. Having looked at SF for a couple weeks, I'm seeing something here that was missing in previous systems: Control.<br><br>First though let me suggest one slight tweak to the rules. The rules say new tasks get entered at the end and worked-on tasks to the current page (aka here). But you can finish a Part of a task and reenter it last page as the next part if you want. Or you can take a new item, decide to do it now, and enter it here. So to simplify: <br>- write anything here if you want to do it now/soon.<br>- write last page if you don't <br>Or to oversimplify:<br>- write here or last page, as seems right.<br> <br>So obviously SAF is just AF1 with an added dimension of Control. <br>You can do AF1 (aim to do a little of everything) by always writing on the last page.<br>Or you can do Triple task by always Rewriting on the current page, choosing only the last 3 items.<br>Or mix the two. <br>But SAF also lets you pull in tasks from elsewhere, so you can control your current workload and continue Focusing. <br>Or you can skip to the next page, work on a new variety of things, while pulling along your major project to get it done. <br><br>Bottom line: Mark is right: this has all the benefits of AutoFocus, plus elements of Control and Focusing.  The key to Super Focus is to use this control for your advantage.  You are the master and SuperFocus is your tool to get done whatever you want. <br><br>I have tons more I want to write, but this is enough for now.</div>

<div class="content">Alan:<br><br>Your proposed tweak to the rules is actually what I've been in practice doing. So thanks for putting it so well.</div>

<div class="content">Alan:<br><br>I absolutely agree. Its taken me a little while to get Superfocus properly working for me - but now that it is, I am definitely getting the control that you refer to.<br><br>For serious procrastinators (and I am one) the tendancy is to "work the list" so that one is productive on the easy stuff. I consistantly have to remind myself that in aapplying Mark's "little and often" approach to the more important stuff (which is often that which I am resisting the most) I need to apply the principle of "often" as rigorously as I apply the principle of "little"!<br><br>I assumed that SAF would help me apply more focus and control. However, in practice I am getting much, much more focus and control than I expected. I'm not completely sure why this is - I'm just enjoying the results..........</div>
