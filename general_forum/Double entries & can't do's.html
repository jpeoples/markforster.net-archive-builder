<div class="content">Any particular recommendations for when I either realize I won't be able to do a task I've entered at all, or I find I've entered something twice? So far I've just been deleting those; should I let them sit until they're dismissed instead, or keep a second duplicate there even after I've "done" the first one? The answer is probably just "use common sense", but especially with new things, what passes for common sense with me sometimes leads me astray, or allows me to miss important points.</div>

<div class="content">Eurobubba:<br><br>I don't think there needs to be a standard answer for everyone to this. It's very much a matter of personal preference. But for the record, my practice is to delete them immediately I spot them. If I come across a duplicate action, I delete the later one and keep the earlier one (unless I have actually started work on the later one).</div>

<div class="content">I have seen a couple of items which I could delete (on the won't do basis as opposed to duplicating) but have found that they are similar items and have highlighted to me that I have previoulsy given myself unnecessary tasks.  I suspect when I have used the system for longer I will have the confidence Mark has to just delete them but for now am allowing the system to reject them so that I can visually see what it is rejecting.</div>
