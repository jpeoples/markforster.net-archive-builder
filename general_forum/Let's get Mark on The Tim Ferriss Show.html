<div class="content">Ha! Okay, if you'd rather not, pull this post. However, I strongly, strongly think you should be on with Tim. He was a reader of yours at some point and has used your methods. You'd be great! And with your new book and systems, it's perfect.</div>

<div class="content">The problem is that I am retired and am not actually looking for a higher level of activity. I've got plenty of things which I am doing and which I want to do which are completely unrelated to this work.</div>
