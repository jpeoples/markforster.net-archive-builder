<div class="content">Just two weeks into AF and I find myself using a LOT of highlighters!   Any thoughts as to whether its a good or bad thing to dismiss a lot of tasks?   Should I be less quick to reach for the highlighter?  <br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Derek</div>

<div class="content">Derek, you might find - like I did - that initially you did kind of a brain dump of anything and everything you want to get done?  And that will lead to a whole lot of highlighting.  <br><br>Mark has some very good advice about allowing your list to grow organically.  You can find it in the FAQ's I think.  Or even search for "organic growth" in the search tool.</div>

<div class="content">I agree that your initial behaviour does not reflect your long term behaviour.  Dismissing is also not bad in itself.  It means you are putting everything into your "inbox" which means you theoretically should trust the system not to miss anything.  After all, if you put too much stuff on, you are only going to go through paper quicker.  It shouldn't affect your productivity.</div>

<div class="content">Based on how I see most people living or trying to live their lives, they might be better off dismissing a lot more.<br><br>Following AF without all these "tweaks" and "hacks" gets me honest about what I can and what I want to do.<br><br>Most of the stuff I read here is a way for folks to stay in urgent and important mode more often, IMHO.<br><br>FWIW.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Norman<br><br>Your comment makes perfect sense and as you can probably tell I would defend "pure AF" to the nth degree.  However sometimes it is just a fact a fact of life that people do actually need to be in "urgent and important mode" for a period of time.<br><br>I love doing pure AF but the fact however remains that there are times in my life when there is a genuine need to stay in urgent and important mode.  That is not by choice but by circumstance.   I could just say that those periods are times when I have no discretionery time and therefore leave AF to one side but I prefer to try to use AF as a tool in those times as well.<br><br>I strongly believe that those times should never become the norm because there is no doubt that living in such a way has a massive impact on lifestyle, stress levels, and ultimately health.  I would imagine that most people goes through such periods at some time and for me, AF is one of the things that is enabling me to keep, if not always on track, at least to keep the track in sight.</div>

<div class="content">Very nice, Christine!  I wholeheartedly agree.  And as one who is spending WAY too much time in urgent and important mode (I feel like running away to a tropical island and becoming a beach bum), it is nice occasionally to have some time blocked off for just pure AF!<br><br>Best wishes,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Hi David<br><br>I know that desert island feeling only too well!  I hope you are remembering to add those "take a break" tasks into your lists! :-)<br><br>I came to a page today which had a task "do nothing" and was most irritated that it didn't jump out!</div>

<div class="content">Yes I'm afraid I broke the rule about not dumping all my previous tasks into AF at the start,  I actually printed out tasks from MLO to paste into an A4 book!  After a few days I quicly realised this would not work, and started using a pocket moleskine and only copies those tasks across that I felt could not be droppoed (or risk losing my job!), but even this list was very long.  Jacqueline / Dr Cris  your posts have explained why this has resulted in large amount of highlighting.  I suppose it boils down to personal preference -  use "pure AF" and dismiss a lot of tasks to ensure you get the important ones covered, or schedule time to "firefight" and work on AF when you are happy all the fires are out for just now.   I currently am leaning towards normal AF - with large amounts of time in my calendar allocated to work on the AF list using the normal method, this is combined with actively scheduling urgent tasks in my calendar as I write them into my AF list.<br><br>Many thanks for the posts, especially Robinson Crusoe AF!  <br><br>Derek.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>Your AF list on a desert island is hysterical!  It certainly made me smile late in the day when I needed it the most.<br><br>Hi Derek D -- thanks for sharing your ideas.  Yes, AF is the best and putting urgent tasks into a calendar system in addition to AF works well for me too.<br><br>Best wishes,<br>-David</div>
