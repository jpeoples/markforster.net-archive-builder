<div class="content">I used to follow the DIT methodology and particularly liked the aspect of<br>knowing what things had to be completed on that day.  But I got tired<br>of rewriting items on the next day (AF solves that problem!)<br><br>Now that I am using AF, I identify the tasks that need to be done today<br>with a "." to the left.  Sometimes these items are not immediately obvious<br>particularly when scattered across several pages, so I created<br>a hack.<br><br>I have a small number of post-it notes about 3 x 2cm in size with<br>an arrow drawn on the sticky side.  I then place these post-it notes<br>against the item.  The note does not protrude outside the pages<br>but it means I can quickly see the "Must-Do" items today.<br>As I complete the items I can store the postit notes somewhere<br>else in my book for later usage.  <br><br>I used this technique to remind me of 3 things I had to do<br>in the evening.<br><br>Another possibility is using different coloured Post-It notes for color-coding, eg<br>Pink for phone calls,  Green for emails to send. <br><br>I read a productivity tip somewhere of asking yourself<br>each morning "What are the 2 or 3 most important things I can do<br>today for for professional and personal life?".  These 2 or 3 items<br>could be tagged with post-it notes.<br><br>And another important hack. Write your name, email address and<br>phone number on your AF notebook. It would be most incovenient to<br>lose it!<br><br></div>
