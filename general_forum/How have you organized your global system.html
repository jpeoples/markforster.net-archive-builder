<div class="content">I launch this thread about your global system. How do you do for managing your stuff. Here is my actual own organization. <br><br>- Task - FVP with "no question" AFP ? :-) on a lined moleskine - write page. left page for temporarly notes. <br>- Projects on another note book, excepts crucial projects on a paper folders. <br>- Strategy and Goals on another special notebook a little rhodia 48 pages<br>- Building Dataroom on my mac <br>- appointment on My my google + on a paper diary for reporting plannings or appointments<br>- Paper tickler for future projects or future paper docs. <br><br>I also work on my projects and plan the next day when I feel it. <br><br>On my comptuter i also use omnifocus which is a collector or projects and tasks from before i decided returning on paper. I explained why in another thread. <br><br>What is yours ? How do you manage all this ?</div>

<div class="content">Just two FVP lists. <br><br>My personal list is on a tablet running Cloud Outliner.  I take it everywhere.  Add, move, select and delete are all onscreen buttons so it's very smooth.  One item in my list is a tickler outline that I reference daily to see if anything else needs to be pulled up to the main. <br><br>My work list is in OneNote, following my old 1 tab per task scheme. It's easy because all tabs are always visible, Ctrl-q highlights, Ctrl-n makes new, Alt-m-enter to move to end, Ctrl-shift-a-del to delete, Ctrl-pageUp/Down to scan.  I also keep a work log page where i type notes as i work.</div>

<div class="content">- I use Outlook for work-related, time-specific items. I didn't choose it, but it's adequate.<br>- Daily planner (paper) for personal, time-specific items.<br>- Occasional undated Planner Pad pages for particularly complicated weeks.<br>- Large (38 lines per page) spiral notebook for work items. It's a cheap notebook because it doesn't have to travel. I don't need to write down most of my tasks, so I'm still on the first page after two weeks. I process it like AF4, or maybe more like DIT: new items are usually for Tomorrow.<br>- Smaller, sturdier notebook (22 lines per page) for personal tasks. I waver between AF and FVP, depending on whether or not it's possible to act on a particular page at the moment. (I've got an issue with a particular category of context-sensitive tasks, but the issue will get worse if I spin those tasks off to a third folder.) <br>- Nascent "17 Folders" tickler system: one folder for each month, and five more for various other dated, semi-dated, and dateless items. My previous "system" was to leave these things in a messy heap on top of my desk where I could be reminded of them all the time. That was more effective than it sounds, but it interfered with the proper use of my desk.<br>- "Project plans" in various formats, most of them very simple (less than one page), slowly finding their way into my 17 Folders.</div>

<div class="content">- One FVP list on paper A7 small notebook<br>- Multiple digital lists in checkvist.com / m.checkvist.com accessible on desktop/mobiles. These serve as my supplementary lists and project tools [1]<br>- One digital calendar Outlook and S-Planner<br>- Digital/scans/photos of documents in Dropbox with descript.ion metadata using Total Commander, files found by keyword searching <br>- Chrome bookmarks on desktop and mobile for all those resources URLs. [3]<br><br>Note:<br>[1] Alternatively I may opt for fargo.io / android outliner pro, if I really need to use a native outliner on my mobile, to reduce "friction". Can transfer via OPML between checkvist and fargo.<br>[2] I did use Evernote but don't really need the power/complexity<br>[3] I did use Delicious.com before they morphed to new owners circa 2011, I now just share nice URLs via G+, FB or twitter.</div>
