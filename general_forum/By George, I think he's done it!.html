<div class="content">Of course it's much too soon to be sure. I haven't even made it once through either of my lists yet. In fact I'm not even following the rules exactly. (My adaptations, suggested by my current media and existing data, I shan't get into. Possibly they'll only stay for a brief transitory period. ) <br><br>Yet this new scheme just feels  right. <br><br>Advancing active tasks to the next page and picking up little stuff along the way seems to be the key. Every AF till now presented a healthy tension between working important and urgent tasks, and the tools to balance these. But With V3 the tension is gone!. The task types balance automatically.  It feels like the work just flows!   <br><br>(  period. )</div>

<div class="content">I am following the rules Mark posted to the letter.....and so far, it is working smoothly and I am quite happy!  So I agree with you and Mark's original post.....I think he really has done it...a perfect mix of the wonders of AF1, taking care of unfinished work, and dealing with new work that shows up that is urgent enough that it needs attention today.  Also, if something on the normal list that because of whatever changing conditions, is now urgent and needs to be actioned, the system handles it well.   The entire mix is there -- I experience all of these situations it seems almost every day...and so far, SF3 is handling them beautifully!<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">I'm amazed how much I got done today.  Still procrastinating a little on some things, but I think that will ease up as I finish up copying across the items from the older list without that 'double-check' system in-built, and the ability to do that goes away.</div>

<div class="content">Agree with the above posts, early day(s), but the focus seems to be more auto!  More peace, less war in task management.<br><br>Another thing, as Mark stressed, having two columns on an A5/Moleskine Large page does indeed force one to be even more specific with the task descriptions.<br><br>Mark: working on SFv3.1 or 4, or AF5? ;-))))))</div>

<div class="content">Just a word of warning, guys. You can't really appreciate the dynamics of this type of system until you have been using it for a while. So don't draw too many conclusions from Day 1 !</div>

<div class="content">"You can't really appreciate the dynamics of this type of system until you have been using it for a while."<br><br>As my Illustrator skills have improved, along with the purchase of a Levinger system, I've been hacking my own systems and forms. Without fail, at the 5-6 day mark, I'm ready to make changes - which I do. Perhaps this is a creative/artistic temperament thing - I've noticed David Seah does this as well. Where as Stephen Covey, David Allen and Tony Robbins - seemingly less creative/artistic - stick to their procedures without change. <br><br>My other hunch is that many don't enjoy their work (or play), and would rather plan/contemplate than do.</div>

<div class="content">Of course you are correct, Mark.  I was just describing how well it is working to date....and still is for me.  But time will tell as new projects, issues, tasks, events, etc. come my way.  Let's see how the system holds up for me.  Right now, it is new....and it is actually fun!<br><br>-David</div>
