<div class="content">Any problem with processing the Active List in reverse mode ala AF3?<br>Also, I don't understand why there is a limit of a single pass through the Active List before going to the Backlog again. That seems to force a lot more focus on the Backlog when there may be many more urgent things in the Active List.</div>

Urgent *and* important tasks will be done in that one pass. If you even wrote them down in the first place and haven't already taken care of them.</div>
