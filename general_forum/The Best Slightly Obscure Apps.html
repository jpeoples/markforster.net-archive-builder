<div class="content">Feel free to add any apps that meet these standards:<br><br>• You use or have used the app, and you like it<br>• Minimalist good looks (no utilitarian, cluttered, "Microsoft 3.0-looking" graphics with buttons everywhere)<br>• Intuitive to use<br>• Reliable<br>• Not an ultra-obvious app like Things, Omnifocus, or Evernote<br>• Must be a downloadable app</div>

<div class="content">Cheddar Plus, flat task list (also multiple lists) each task may have multiple hashtags. Sync to other devices and web. Supports Markdown. Original developer stopped development, was in limbo. Now been picked back up with new developer who has time to put energy into, currently free service. Clean simple, wanted to love the any task can be in any of multiple hashtags, in actual use, not sure that is the way to go for me. Also weirdness, never able to delete task, they all go into one growing archive. Worth a look, even if just for the orange color.<br><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cheddar-plus/id919567005" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cheddar-plus/id919567005</a></div>

<div class="content">For Android:<br><br>Halna outliner. No, it's not elegant, but I don't know of a better Android outliner, and that's surely the  relevant thing. I rely on it.</div>

<div class="content">Hey, <br><br>I came across TDouble (tdouble.weebly.com), which was mentioned in another topic on this forum and found it really convenient to track 24/7. No stopwatch - awesome! ). But there is only android version (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.vertigo.time.tracker).<br><br><br>Maria</div>

<div class="content">Probably doesn't qualify as obscure enough, but I use Pocket ( <a href="http://getpocket.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://getpocket.com</a> ) a lot. I particularly like the way it syncs across different devices, so you can put an article in it from your desktop and then read it on your mobile while stuck on a train somewhere.</div>

<div class="content">Re: TDouble: sorry that this is somewhat o/t here, but - if any user of TDouble (Maria, Pavel ...?) can tell where me where to find user instructions, I'd be grateful.</div>

<div class="content">Well, I did not find instruction for TDouble myself either, except for the first launch starting page. For me it sounds simple: use spinner to chose time of the activity and fill in time passed bar. On the left there are the activities description with up to three levels of depth (one may desribe just one level if does not want to eleborate). Still not clear?<br><br>Maria</div>

<div class="content">@Maria<br><br>Definitely not clear, Maria! It's the most puzzling interface I've come across.<br><br>But this isn't the place to discuss it. I'll struggle with it a little more - but not much, because I'm not sure of the value of time-tracking to me.<br><br>Thanks for your post.</div>
