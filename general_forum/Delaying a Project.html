<div class="content">Haven't found a good answer to this, and haven't discovered on my own a good way to handle it either.  I have a project that I want to do later this year:  Install a privacy fence along one side of my property.  I don't want it in my FV list now, as it is too cold to do it.  I don''t feel it is appropriate to put it on a calendar, as doing the job will depend a lot on the weather, not on an actual date.  But I don't want to suddenly remember it next December, when it is again to cold to do the project.  BTW, I often have a few of these types of projects.<br><br>I've tried having a separate backlog list but I tend to keep adding things to this list until it becomes overwhelming, then I ignore it.<br><br>Any suggestions?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Dave<br>When you think it would be a good time to start preparing for the job, place a reminder as a monthly note, not a specific date.  Example: March: Consider Fencing Project.  <br>Then, optionally, you can make a short list of things you'd need to do and get to prepare for the job.  Maybe in March you could brainstorm the lumber you want to use: start drawing up your schematics to submit to your local building inspecter: if you don't know your local codes, start researching it (you don't want a neighbor to call the inspector and then they make you tear it down!)consider and research places to rent tools/equipment you might need to rent: check out lumber prices: check out fittings and hardware prices: search ideas for fence patterns, checkout who will be my second pair of hands, etc.....<br><br>It'll get your toe into the water.  Sometimes I'll set up flexible milestones to force myself to make decisions (especially when there are so many options.) In March, you can also decide what you want to focus on for April.....likely it's getting time to actually pull the trigger.  It's a lot of decision making and a lot of work but I'm sure you'll enjoy your efforts.  A carpenter once told me that for every hour you work, give yourself 5 minutes to stare at your accomplishment!  Add to your list to get your grill ready and the beer tank checked....</div>

<div class="content">I put stuff like that in one (or more) of three different places, depending on how organized I feel at the moment of writing, and how much planning the project will need.<br><br>First, the page in front of me. Least distracting, fastest back today's projects. The task is actually "put some more thought into the project". Maybe the page after the page in front of me (DIT-style).<br><br>Calendar. Fast. Lives in my purse. There's only room for a few items a month on it, but I'm guaranteed to see it when I need to. I put it on the month I need to start planning, not the month I need to start working. For a fence, I'd put the note even earlier -- just before the local lumber yards start fencing sales. After three Septembers (boot sale season) of my husband saying, "I don't really need new boots," followed by January "I need new boots -- and the stores are already out," I finally called the store, asked which season they had the best selection, and put "buy boots" on the calendar. I'm moving away from that now that I use the weekly milestone chart, but it's great for quick reminders when the big chart isn't handy.<br><br>If I expect building-season to be busy, I even mark off a few weekends for the actual work. If something else comes up, I'm reminded of the fence project, and can make an informed decision.<br><br>Weekly Milestone Chart. I love this chart. I can tell at a glance how all my projects are doing. Milestones for a fence project would be: Research. Make schedule for other people (permit visits, lumber delivery, work party). Build. Paint.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Dave<br>Hell!  I forgot the most important first thing, make sure you have your property lines correct. The inspector might make you bring in the documentation to prove it. (Usually it's with your papers when you bought the house done by an approved surveyor and stamped.)  Also, it's a good idea to make your plan at least 6" to a foot inside your line as shown on the survey.  Get this done first before you do anything else!</div>

<div class="content">I've already done the majority of the prep work - including talking to my neighbor, talking  to the county office for regulations, I have the materials and tools (fence panels given to me for free!) and I have the layout all figured out.  And a friend has offered to help.  And of course, I have a fridge full of beer in the garage at all times!  All I need is a pleasant weekend, and that is where I get stuck.  I guess I could put on a calendar "check weather for fence installation" and just move it up each week if the weather is bad.  However, that is not the only delayed project I have, and I don't want to overwhelm my calendar with this type of stuff.  I like to keep it for actual appointments and other scheduled events.</div>

<div class="content">Hi, Dave<br>It sounds like you're practically good to go!  We all have delayed projects. I just pick a few and at least one of them being something I can get excited about to offset the couple that just need doing.  Maybe you can just choose one or two bigger jobs a season.  Just for the steaks,ribs and cold beer, I'd definitely prioritize the fence job!</div>

<div class="content">I'd put the actual build on the calendar, with a rain date. Otherwise it's too tempting to put it off because it's a little too hot, or a little too cold, or you didn't wake up early enough to get the day started, or you each have several available days, but they aren't the same. Depending on your area, you might want more than one rain date.<br><br>Another method, that works if there's only one person to schedule, is keep a list of your projects. Put things that are hard to schedule (e.g., depend on good weather) on top. Every project day, pick the first one that's doable. That's more like MIT (most important thing) than AF, since the order never changes, but MIT is only one thing. I still need to add target dates, though. I'm too likely to put off everything on the list otherwise.</div>

<div class="content">I guess I am not explaining my dilemma well enough.  If I only had this one project, putting it on a calendar would not be an issue for me.  But I have several like this.  My wife and I want to take a four day motorcycle ride across southern Ohio and Indiana on the Ohio River Scenic Byway this summer.  I need to paint the exterior of our back porch and shed.  I want to create a dog run outside our utility room door. I have a landscape project I want to do.  And a few others.  These are all things that will require good weather for a few consecutive days.  I don't want to put them all down every week, in hopes that the weather will be good.  I want a way to keep them alive, so when the opportunity is there, I can pick the one that I want to do at that time.  My calendar is integrated into my FV notebook, so I always have it with me.  Someone here at work suggested I use a post it note with these projects listed on it and move the note forward on the calendar as time passes.  May give it a try.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Dave<br>You've won my heart. I gave my husband a tricked out Harley Sportster for his wedding gift. Of course I made sure that it had a sissy seat!  <br><br>If you have more than a few projects, I'd make a list of them. Maybe even have lists made out and supplies bought and ready to do the job when the sun presents itself.  I laid a basket weave patio and 2 sidewalks over a summer.  I got up at 4-4:30am (summers are hot here) and worked on it when the weather allowed.  I also did some work in the evenings well before sunset. (I had 2 jobs so I had to find the time somehow.)On one or both days off, I did more.  Painting needs to be more temperate weather so it will adhere good.  I'd put that one on the top of the list only to choose it when the weather allows.  If you're setting your fence posts in cement, you have to wait until any chance of freezing during the night has past and it won't likely rain for at least 48 hours.  Depending on which stage you are with the landscaping job(s), see?<br>I'd definitely write these down so you can judge according to mother nature. Get used to either watching the weather or going on line.....STILL....You want to know that you're choosing the right job for the days you're doing the work.  Since I was time crunched, I did a few jobs in tandem and chose according to both the appropriate weather and what job I could do in the time I had to do it.  Some jobs can be broken down better than others.  <br><br>I must say that you have chosen an enviable carrot!  <br><br>I hope you and your wife enjoy your trip.  I wanted to go on the road for 2 weeks on our new sportster......nope....It backfired.  He stated that it was too good to be on the road like that.  Instead I watched him wash it every day for years and go on short rides.......Maybe I should have done less customizing on it. (I hired it out. I don't know how to chrome dip...)</div>

<div class="content">The only way that works is to pick one -- just like you pick an MIT in DIT. My family has done it both ways. The projects we focus on get done. The ones we multi-task don't. Projects that have restrictions like weather gets priority over things that don't. Steps that have to be done before the weather-dependent steps get done ASAP.<br><br>Trust me on this. We have too many unfinished projects we have around here, gnawing at our consciences. The few that we focus on (steps at MIL's cottage on vacation, sidewalk neighbours offered to help with) are done and we barely remember the pain of doing them.<br><br>The other thing is to assign responsibility. As soon as I say, "Oh, I can do that step of your project," it's over. I invariably forget I volunteered, and then neither of us works on it. Sigh. (Hey -- he's home. I'm going to get him to use that nasty caulking-removal gel before supper, see if we can get a bit more done.)</div>

<div class="content">Put the project on your calendar at the earliest date it could be done. Then on that date write it on your task list with a query after it, e.g. <br><br>"Install privacy fence?"<br><br>That way it only appears on your calendar once, and only appears on your list during the "open season" for that task/project.<br><br>Another method is to pair off good weather and bad weather projects so that you can have them as alternatives, e.g.<br><br>"Install privacy fence OR paint kitchen"</div>

<div class="content">Hi Cricket<br>With all due respect, I have done several jobs in tandem and they were successfully completed...because I laid out good plans and being a landscape designer I knew the route.  Everybody works differently.  I wanted the jobs done by October.  I also hired out and had to supervise those jobs also.  With proper planning, you can successfully complete several jobs in tandem.  If I only focused on one job at a time, I'd have never been able to finish when I wanted to.  Example: I'm laying brick.  Step one, dig the area.  It's raining, but, hey, I don't mind rain. I'll flush the gutters instead.....<br><br>Everybody is different. I was also doing a few landscaping jobs while I was doing my own place.  Everybody was satisfied.  One of the best ways to drum up business it to have a beautifully landscaped yard.....also to show off decisions, grass blends, sprinkler systems, fencing, bed mulches, bed borders, trees, shrubs, lawn covering, materials for sidewalks, patios, decks, etc......My yard was a great portfolio by itself.  I synchronized the hiring out and my own labors the same if I had been contracted to do a job.  Trust me. I can be done and is done like that on a professional basis.<br><br>Focusing on only one job is OK but when you have several jobs to do and a deadline, you need to be a good planner, group direction and self direction.  It's not a cake walk. But it gets done under deadline.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark<br>I concur with your recommendations.  Another good skill is to know when to sub-contract. Sometimes the ROI is there....and build and maintain a list of reliable subcontractors.  That part took me awhile to understand.  Sometimes I subcontracted out because of deadlines and sometimes it was because I didn't have that area of expertise.  Example: If I needed mature trees planted or extensive cement work, complicated patios, etc.....I didn't have the equipment nor the specialized skill.  Plus those guys can sometimes get a better rate on supplies.</div>

<div class="content">I prefer to keep items on my master (FV) list, even all items which are not-so-well-defined-in-all-aspects. I have found 2 habits that could be useful in situations like yours.<br><br>First, how to write items? I start to solify ’wishware projects’ with 3 items like ’Garden fence ready, latest July’, ’Garden fence, start April’ and ’Garden fence (sketches, lumber, etc.)’, in other words what is the best estimate at the time when I write things down the first time. <br><br>Second, special conditions. I use squared paper and my item writing begins on square 7 and FV’s dot is in square 6. Square 1 for a ’special condition’ tag; it’s empty for items that can be done in usual environments about anytime.  On the other hand, if I go downtown,  I check the first column for ’shp’ and ’DT’. If I go to summer cottage, I check it for ’cott’.  If it is warm and sunny, I check it for SUN. And ’+5C’ means that when the night temperature is above zero it’s time to cut away some branches from the apple trees. And so on.<br><br>In a way I have learnt to use the first column/square to make  subcollections related to different conditions.  When some condition comes true I pick and prioritize items tagged for that condition over others.</div>

<div class="content">I would do what Mark suggests.    However, since I am using DIT, I would put the item on a future page in my DIT notebook, rather than on my calendar.</div>
