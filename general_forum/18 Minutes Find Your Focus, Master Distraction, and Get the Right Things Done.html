<div class="content">In Feb 2011, I used one of Peter Bregman's ideas - <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/bregman/2009/07/an-18minute-plan-for-managing.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.hbr.org/bregman/2009/07/an-18minute-plan-for-managing.html</a> - to provide mindfulness, focus and nostalgia (I would draw a quick cartoon every hour). His new book will be out on Sept 28:<br><br><a href="http://peterbregman.com/18-minutes/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://peterbregman.com/18-minutes/</a></div>

<div class="content">The first link says:<br>5 minutes, beginning of day: plan what to do. Block out time for the important items. <br>1 minute, each hour: review status. Refocus.<br>5 minutes, end of day: review day. <br>Not bad advice in general. Having particular short term goals is always helpful, and regularly reminding yourself is also. <br><br>Now what's the cartoon have to do with this ?</div>

<div class="content">Alan:<br><br><<Now what's the cartoon have to do with this>><br><br>I've designed pages (in Illustrator) to fit my Circa planner. Each page has lines for my DWM list, as well as borders for cartoons. My alarm chimes every hour, a mindfulness trigger, where i ask myself some of Bregman's questions, and draw a very quick one box cartoon sketch about what I'm doing/thinking. The end result (I did this in Feb 2011) is a cool looking journal of goals, tasks and drawings. For me, this work becomes a written document of my life.</div>

<div class="content">I'm currently using Canson's Comic Book paper for my DWM list & daily comic sketch:<br><br><a href="http://admin.fineartstore.com/big/b30374.jpg" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://admin.fineartstore.com/big/b30374.jpg</a><br><br>However, I'm going to try Peter's to-do list (based on your 5 major yearly goals) suggestion and 18 min plan via my own pages created in Illustrator.</div>

<div class="content">Avrum,<br><br>Thanks for the timely resourse for hourly check-ins, as well as the cartoon idea. <br><br>Can anyone direct me to an explanation for DWM?. I haven't found it on the website or through Google.</div>

<div class="content"><< SuperFocus v0.3 is, of course, found in the link at the upper right corner of this webpage. >><br>That links to <a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2011/2/10/rules-for-superfocus.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2011/2/10/rules-for-superfocus.html</a> and doesn't specify any version number. Perhaps that's the only "current/official" SF version.<br><br>Mark's earlier SF review at <a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2011/1/28/review-of-the-systems-superfocus.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2011/1/28/review-of-the-systems-superfocus.html</a> did mention "v. 3". I think that refers to version 3, not version 0.3. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">+JMJ+<br><br>I've checked, and you're right, sabre23t.  And for all of this time I've always thought it was SFv0.3! 8-D<br><br>Godspeed.</div>

<div class="content">To make it clear, v. 3 of SuperFocus is an update of the rules and is the only current version of SuperFocus.<br><br>AutoFocus 1, AutoFocus 2, etc are entirely different systems one from another, not just rule updates.<br><br>DWM2 is a different method of running DWM but is essentially the same system.</div>

<div class="content">Nuntym et al,<br><br>Many thanks for the links and the subsequent corrections. Particular kudos to Mark F., for having such an open mind on this blog. I've been concerned about posting resources here because I didn't want to water down your approach. I'm beginning to see that this forum is sort of an open classroom for what works in the area of time management. I hope I will be as open-minded with the blog I'm creating that will be dedicated to resources for living a fully engaged life. Mark, you are a role model on how to make a dream come true.</div>
