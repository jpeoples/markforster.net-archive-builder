<div class="content">Cool!<br><br>I just sent them a comment with my endorsement and clarifying the whole "paper-based" thing.  That's the way it's described but obviously many here are using electronic methods.<br><br>Now's the time for Mark to start figuring a way to rake in the piles of money!</div>

<div class="content">My worry now is that trolls who have found this site via Lifehacker will start posting deliberately provocative posts, breaking windows, and making the neighborhood generally less pleasant.</div>

<div class="content">A good thiing ( not from AF because I have done this before) is that I do not visit this kind of websites or blogs anymore.  <br><br>Mike, I am afraid you be right concerning your worries. I also think Mark Forster asked not to post part of the system but to direct people to the website.</div>

<div class="content">I found this system via Lifehacker and I have to say after really looking at it, I like it a lot and I'm going to try it. I have a lot of problems with staying focused and getting my work done so I've really needed to try something like this and hopefully it will go well. <br><br>Thank you for taking the risk of posting it at Lifehacker. And if it matters at all, I think it's a lot better when the system is on paper because paper isn't tethered to a wall or limited to battery. <br>Thanks again :)</div>

<div class="content">I ended up posting a long-ish comment there. I think maybe 90% of people who come here after reading Lifehacker will not give AF a second thought, but the other 10% -- which is still a huge number of people -- might find it interesting. But that was the risk of making AF public anyway, right? :)<br><br>I think I would not really try AF after seeing it in Lifehacker, because of all the crackpot systems they have posted over the years. Of course there are some gems (I remember Gina's post about the "Trusted Trio"), but most of the times I just skip posts about productivity.</div>

<div class="content">Yes, don't feed trolls and don't be stung by their provocative comments.</div>

<div class="content">. . . unless of course their comments give you a good hook on which to hang something you intended to write anyway.</div>
