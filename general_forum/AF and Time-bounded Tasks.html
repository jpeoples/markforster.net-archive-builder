<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-02-23 6:09</div>
<div class="content">Here's a question: how do you manage things that have to be done on a particular day with AutoFocus? As an example, I lost a bet a while back, and I have to bring in pastries for our staff meeting this coming Thursday. Does something like that fit into AutoFocus at all (I can't immediately see how), or is that simply something that goes onto my calendar, like an appointment...?</div>

<div class="content">In general, time-specific tasks go to the calender. The autofocus list is for use in your discretionary time.<br><br>Personally, I differentiate between the time-specific event itself and preparation for it. It put preparatory steps on my af list, but I also put a reminder on the calender enough time ahead of the event. So I have to opportunity to do it by using autofocus, but the reminder ensures that I do it in time if I didn't get to it. For example I really must send a form to my health insurance today, so I have "send form to health insurance" on my calendar, but I also had "fill out health insurance form" on my af list.<br><br>In my own implementation - <a href="http://autofocus.cc" rel="nofollow">http://autofocus.cc</a> - I ultimately plan to add a separate management for time-specific task and have those tasks that are due be displayed above my af list in a different color.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Lefty<br><br>Andreas is correct about the calendar and makes an excellent point about differentiating between the task and the preparatory steps.  If I have any sort of timed appointment it will generally start off on my list as "add appontment x" to schedule.  In the past I would write things down on a scrap of paper and forget until the last minute, or even later on occasion :-) I also have a task on each page to "check schedule".  Even if that task is already completed it still reminds me that my schedule exists!<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Christine:<br><br>I find the "Check Schedule" task is a particularly important one because it allows me to write down all the preparatory tasks for the coming week or so.</div>

<div class="content">I'm dealing with this slightly differently, and thought I was following one of Mark's instructions!  I have a post-it (the instruction, I believe, was for a note card) on which I note things which have to be done today but don't have a time.  (Timed appointments do go in my diary.)  I put the post-it opposite the autofocus page I'm working on and include it as part of the page when I move through the page looking for what to do now.  I'm finding this works really well.  All the things to do today get done, but they don't push out the less time-specific jobs completely.  It's also saved me from constantly doing email as it comes in. I put 'email morning' and 'email evening' on my do-today post-it so that I know it will get checked sufficiently and then ignore incoming messages in-between.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark and Lesley<br>I came here for more tips before I clock in (8:00am) to help me with working with my autofocus list......Thank you, Mark and Leslie!  It feels as if the seas have parted.  Mark, thank you for the solution for weekly planning......just put my weeklies on my list when I review the calendar.  Very close to the weekly review and upcoming week planning session!  Lesley, thank you......THINK of the floating today note as part of the page I'm working on.................THIS STUFF IS GOLDEN!!!!!!   THANK YOU!  I prophesize that today I'll feel much more confident with using Autofocus!  Also, thank you Christine for assuring me that a project list alongside Autofocus works to sprinkle in prompts on my autofocus list.<br>I won't lie and say that I feel at all comfortable with it yet......but I'll attribute that to a normal learning curve, yeah?<br>THANK YOU all very much...........The responses on this thread seem to suggest to me that my needs aren't so different from autofocus after all.  If these tips were mentioned in the instructions, I would be light years ahead of where I am now.  I'm excited to try to implement these daily, weekly and project instructions.  Hmmmm....load paper into printer and print out this thread to accomodate my sieve brain. I'm treating my ventures into learning how to work autofocus like a pitbull in the ring.  I'm not letting go unless I win or die trying!  *blush*<br>again, THANK YOU ALL!!!!!!<br>fingers crossed!!!!!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>Do you start your day with a quick review of the entire list or do you simply start from where you left off yesterday?  Mark, you mentioned in another post about daily tasks that aren't time sensative such as practice German, process email, etc....Do you have a way to organize your thinking to make sure that you're actually aware of what you want to do today or are you relying on a part of your brain (short-term memory) to guide you through your list to ensure that these items will be both looked at and done.  Of course, I'm not including habituated tasks.<br>Thank you<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">p.s.s.<br>Since I don't always have access to the areas of my brain that "tags" tasks to reasons of why to do it or bypass it in favor of another task item without external cueing, I experimented with removeable clear flags.  Blue for morning, orange for pm, pink for anytime.  Once I cleared those particular ones, I used the left over time for doing Autofocus au natural.  It worked good.....but....I want to fold in these tips on this thread into my process mix.  (I have a cheat sheet of the intructions bullet pointed to aide my memory.  I'll do the same with this post) Without the tags, I get too overwhelmed because my brain doesn't always cue up properly so that either every item stands out or I draw a total blank like I'm in the vortex of a hurricaine.  The tags helped tremendously (along with using my cheat sheets I've been using from cognitive reconstruction therapy sessions. My brain is like the difference between having power windows or the old window cranks!  LOL LOL LOL  <br>Any suggestions?<br>learning as I go</div>

I certainly get the impression from your posts that you making a lot of breakthroughs in the ways in which AF works but can appreciate your frustrations - with short term memory loss issues you NEED to have systems in place to allow for that and should never feel that is in any way "cheating".<br><br>One thought struck me - have you thought of recommending AF to your healthcare professionals?  It crossed my mind that, if they start to use the system and take to it, then they may be able to identify some specific techniques in your cognitive reconstruction therapy that would help you.<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine<br>I no longer attend cognitive therapy.  According to them, the window for brain repair has past.............but I don't listen to that!  *blush*  My sessions lasted about a year and a half yet......all these years later, I continue to do certain exercises and perhaps it's wishful thinking but I feel that I'm helping myself to continue to do the exercises.  I'm not much of a "give up" type.  *blush*  Besides, where's the harm?<br>Secondly, the jury's still out with autofocus for me.  It's MUCH harder to implement than my hyrid DIT system but I feel compelled to try because of many raves about it!  I suspect that I'm still searching for anything that has the possibility of making my life less difficult. All these years later, I'm still doing whatever I can to try to find ways to bring my life to feeling closer to "normal living".  I'm not daft....I know that pain will always be a HUGE spammer in the works and memory issues will always frustrate me....YET....any little improvement is worth chasing after, yeah?   Again, where's the harm?<br>As far as advice from my doctors and therapists?.....They admonish me for not taking my meds often enough, for not using the life services I'm entitled to, for being to optimistic about any improvements, etc......Why do I want to believe that I can't hope for better if I'm willing to keep trying?  Nope, I'd rather not listen to them!  LOL!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>Hi, Christine<br>Upon re-reading this post, I don't want to give the impression that I'm stubborn without any logic attached to my actions.<br>1.  drugs:  I'm conservative with them because they are highly addictive narcotics.  Several people I know with pain issues became addicted.  They seemed to expect the lower pain levels produced by the narcotics was their "set point".  I, instead, regard the pain as my "set point" and consider the drugs as relief when I need a respite.  Otherwise, I employ my biofeedback lessons as much as I can get away with.  Three of my acquaintances had the same neurosurgeon and PC doc as me.  They all got cut off and had to resort to making do with lesser meds, rehab, begging and buying drugs on the street.  Yet, these docs never cut me off because I use them conservatively.  I'd rather not deal with the same pain PLUS rehab or scrounging illegally for a dose!<br>2.  Life services.  True, I'm entitled but this is mostly a pride factor.  I'd rather make my own bed, bathe myself in private, decide on and prepare my own food, keep my own house clean, etc......I do rely on my friends to allow me to tag along when they are going to the grocer, post office, etc anyway.  Driving and sitting is sometimes torture and I can't take narcotics while being behind the wheel to not notice sciatica shooting!  LOL!  Plus, if the drive is 15 minutes, then I've invited up to days of extra pain by sitting that long.  It's a trade off.  As a passenger, I can fidget in my seat to ward off the sciatica setting in.  My friends don't mind because I'm just tagging along.  I'm not asking them to re-arrange their schedule.<br>3.  If I didn't keep trying for improvements, I'd become depressed.  I don't want to experience that again!  I had Post Traumatic Stress Disorder with Major Depression.  Nope, I don't want that again.  Optimism may be a waste but it's definitely thereputic!  Besides, I truly believe that my efforts have proved to be of some help in improving both myself and in running my affairs....i.e. quality of life matters.<br>I hope this made some sense.  I'm not saying that my docs are wrong....yet, I don't believe I'm wrong either.  LOL!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">learning as I go<br><br>It sounds to me as if you've got things really well under control and that your approach is eminently sensible.  I know doctor's don't like to give false hope but it seems to me that there's a massive difference between listening to what you've been told are the medical facts and working to improve on that, and being unrealistic.  As I understand it, medical science supports the positive and sometimes inexplicable benefits of a positive approach :-)  As for the drugs, you have made an informed and balanced decision with regard to your pain management, and the fact that you have avoided addiction as a result is a testament to that being the right thing for you - I'm not sure I could have been that brave in your situation and I suspect your doctors feel the same!  I think it's great that you're making the right decisions for you and I really hope that you can get AF to work for you, not because I think it is the be all and end all but because I think you will really enjoy it!  And for the record I believe optimism is never a waste!</div>

<div class="content">Déjà vu – I just answered a question about paying monthly bills with the same basic suggestion…<br><br>I subscribe to Backpack (www.backpackit.com) and use its Reminders to 'remember' one-time events.  On the day and time I choose, I get a text message on my phone and an email.<br><br>Set the recorder for a TV show that’s a month away, review dismissed items six weeks from now, etc.  I can set one for 8pm tonight that will remind to get a book off my shelf to bring to work tomorrow.  The one for renewing my driver’s license is scheduled for June 30, 2011, and on that day I’ll get a text message reminder on my phone.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine<br>I'm glad you understand both the docs' and my perspective as OK.  I had to quit my pain management doc because I refused to take what he wanted me to have.  (They don't relate that they've never had to wean me or cut my meds to lower (less addictive) like LOTS of their other patients.  If you take the strengths and the intervals that they recommend then you lose sight of the actual pain.  They are judging by the injuries on the MRIs.................not me as a thinking and feeling person who craves independence.  Luckily, my PC doc is willing to prescribe my meds and doesn't pressure me to take the worst ones and he doesn't complain too much that I don't take them enough....I get the take the meds for quality of life lecture on occasion but I didmiss it.  His arguement is that I wait too long to finally take my meds and then need 2 or 3 to knock out that level of pain.  I retort:  But I always refill WAY later than your dosing recommends because I've learned how to tolerate no meds for higher levels of pain.  Therefore, I'm taking far less meds in the long run.  He doesn't like it but he won't refuse me because my MRI's suggest far stronger and far more often than I'm taking them....even if on occassion I wait too long to take them at all.  Who needs that?  From biofeedback, I just envision that I'm hurt during sports and I want to stay in the game.  If I give in, I'm essentially benching myself!  LOL!  Also I was taught, When you beg off feeling sick, you're putting your work on someone else's back.  Even though I'm entitled to life services, let them help folks who can't do it at all!!!!!  not someone who CAN do it.....hey, I'm going to hurt anyway.  What's the difference between huring in the bed or hurting while I take care of my affairs?  LOL!<br>THANK YOU FOR UNDERSTANDING!!!!!!  I catch hell about this from many sources!  LOL!  I'd be totally worthless if I didn't feel decent about myself, yeah?<br><br>Yes, I'm really giving my all to learning autofocus.....because I want to experience what you all are!  *blush*  I'm not sure it's going to "take" but I've still got plenty of time to keep trying, yeah?  (I do my old ways for the really important stuff later in the day where I flopped with autofocus.  I'm still getting the experience but the backup method quells anxiety of missing something which I do with autofocus.  My brain might just need time to learn it.......I'll see, I guess!<br>learning as I go<br><br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">p.s.  Please don't consider me as brave.....I'm not!  I'm as scared as a jackrabbit being chased by a wolf!  LOL!  I don't want to be a dependent!  YIKES!!!!!  I'd just shrivel up and die!  *blush*<br>Plus, fear and stubborness keeps me prime enough to take care of myself and it jacks up the gratitudes!!!!  It's amazing just how wonderful regular living is without all the bells and whistles we think we need, yeah?  And nobody can accuse me of not knowing how to eek out the most of everything.....even nothing, like star gazing, walking the dog, cutting fresh veggies.....some of these were dreaded chores before.....now they are gratitude rituals (most of the time, I still get cranky sometimes and can't see past my trivial bitching!  LOL LOL LOL)<br>Mark taught us the "what's better?" to add to our list.  When I'm too cranky, I'll write that down and make myself come up with something better and list 10 gratitudes.....works every time!   Sorry, I still love so much from DIT.......but that's OK for autofocus although I'd need to skip over everything to do "what's better?" soon enough to get me back around to a good mood!
