<div class="content">Since AF4 was revealed, I have been using pen and paper in a small notebook, and this led to much higher productivity - a release from hi-tech! But while I am convinced of the essential logic behind AF4, as the list has grown, I find I am getting diminishing returns as it takes too long to plow through the list again when I return to the closed list, which consists of a great many almost completed pages. I also have to filter manually for the tasks relevant to the place where I am.<br><br>So I am considering reverting to ListPro. This can easily present those tasks which can be done at any one place, and also those which can only be done at a specific place. I am thinking of using a separate dividing line for each place (this is the system I use for inbox zero email, drawing on AF4 methodology).<br><br>But ... I love entering the items by hand, so I shall probably continue doing so, in a single notebook, and crossing them out as they are transferred to ListPro.<br><br>As Roger has said, ListPro is pretty good for AF. Perhaps some judicious use of AutoHotKey may automatically tick and copy to the bottom.</div>

<div class="content">Laurence - I preached, in a separate post, about sticking with paper if you're having trouble with AF4 because it worked so well for me.  Then I accidentally left my notebook at home and went electronic for a day.  Now I'm converted.<br><br>I use tadalist.com because it's super simple, fast, easy, looks great on my iPhone, and can manage multiple lists.  I use a tabbed browser so I have one tab open to my Open list and one to my Closed list.  I also have a Review list and a Notwork list (for items I can't do here at work).  The lists are easily renamed so when I turn an open list into a closed list I'll just rename it.  I add the date I open a list, and other info/notes, in each list's 'description'.<br><br>Emphasis is on fast and simple.  I've discovered I had the same issue as you - it was time-consuming to wander through a mix of checked-off and open tasks, flipping through several pages.  Tada moves completed items to the bottom of the page so you only see outstanding items.  Very clean.</div>

<div class="content">I use a computer, but I firmly believe in the value of short lists.  So I recommend you consider your list and remove duplicates, merge related tasks, remove stuff you aren't going to do. <br><br>What I mean is,  as you are going through your list considering each item, whether you should do it or not, at that moment also give a thought to whether maybe you have no intention of doing it soon, and getting it out of there.<br><br>But if your problem is just few tasks over many pages, maybe the answer is just to rewrite your list once to make it concise.  BTW, if I ever decide to go paper, I expect I'd use a stack of index cards.  That would solve your particular problem.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Laurence/Zane/Alan, <br><br>Your posts have confirmed I'm not the only one "stuck in the middle . . . " between electronic and manual!<br><br>While I envy all those iPhone and Blackberry applications available, i have to carry on for now with Windows Mobile and ListPro as I already have them.<br><br>Over the last few days I've been finding that  it may be possible for me to use ListPro for Backlog/Closed and my ink notebook for Current/Open.  I only have to update ListPro when the Backlog/Closed is completed/earmarked for review, then the ink notebook has a line drawn below the last item and then all outstanding ink tasks entered into ListPro to form the new Backlog/Closed list.<br><br>The next task to be written down (except for MUST-BE-DONE-IMMEDIATELY) will be on the first line below the line drawn in the ink notebook.<br><br>I'll try to give feedback later on this HYBRID:<br><br>Backlog/Closed = ListPro<br>Current/Open = ink notebook (with Backlog/Closed printed and inserted into ink notebook as a reference, which means one can operate just with the ink notebook if necessary0.<br><br>My existing ListPro is very basic in terms of fields, values etc, more later. maybe.<br><br>Aluta continua.<br><br>Roger</div>

<div class="content">Hey, Zane. Tadalist is what I used when I first started AF. Interesting that it works with AF4, too.</div>

<div class="content">I've adapted my hybrid system and it seems to be working nicely with ListPro AND a notebook (Moleskine medium size, close to A5)<br><br>Bearing in mind I have a laptop (Toshiba Portege M700) and a Smartphone/PDA (HTC TouchPro 2), I can use AF4 thus:<br>- ListPro contains my Backlog/Closed and Current/Open Tasks ie tasks by Status<br>- the notebook's right-hand pages contain only new tasks that spring to mind (some of which I decide to do immediately or get to later in the day), but which are NOT in ListPro; the left-hand pages record notes from phone calls, meetings.<br><br>This means I can cycle through ListPro as per the AF4 rules, with Current/Open consisting of Current/Open in ListPro PLUS any tasks written down in the notebook during the day.<br><br>For repeating tasks, like emails, clear Inbox etc, I can mark them done. and ListPro does a satisfying strikethrough.<br><br>At the end of the day, I do the following:<br>- in ListPro: delete non-recurring completed tasks (I may cut and paste them into a Done/Zapped list if I think I may want to do them again some time in the future).<br>- in ListPro: change the status of completed recurring tasks in Backlog/Closed to Current/Open and resort the list by Status.<br>- in ListPro: tasks for Review (in Backlog/Closed) are cut and pasted into a Review List, and a Review task added in the main AF4 list in ListPro.<br>- any tasks written down in the notebook during the day and NOT addressed are entered in ListPro with Current/Open Status.<br><br>Thus at the beginning of the day, i do not have to look in the notebook for any tasks, just bring up ListPro and write down new ones during the day.  If I am away from my laptop, I have the synchronised LIstPro lists in my HTC Smartphone/PDA, AND my notebook.  I can also print my AF4 list and fold it inside my notebook<br><br>I may not have explained my hybrid system very well, but would welcome constructive comments or questions.  I'd be interested in Andreas' super system if it could by synchronised between laptop and Smartphone - maybe it does already and I've missed something!</div>

<div class="content">Addendum:<br><br>I realise Laurence has stated the approach better than me in the very first thread!  Writing everything down FIRST does seem to assist with internalising some tasks.<br><br>Laurence: I've also incorporated a dividing line.  As mentioned in other posts, I can also sort my tasks by Context, as I think you do.  This enables some older smaller tasks that have been hanging around to be grouped under, for example, Travel and knocked off at the airport IF feasible.</div>
