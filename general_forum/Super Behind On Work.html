<div class="content">Hi Clive,<br><br>Here's a good blog article of Mark's to read:<br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2008/4/1/getting-back-on-track.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2008/4/1/getting-back-on-track.html</a><br><br>I would personally make a list of everything that really has to be done ASAP and do a triage type of prioritization.   I wouldn't waste my time writing down other stuff that doesn't matter right now.  You just need to put the fires out in this kind of situation, not worry about anything that's smoldering.  Every time you tick off one of the things on your list ask yourself the question again "what's the best use of my time right now?" or "what needs to be down now?" before picking the next thing to do.  Focus on the biggest payoff items first.<br><br>I'd also delegate and get help where I could and weasel out of whatever I thought I could get away with.  I'd put in a reasonable amount of O.T. to get things back on track, but not too much as it becomes counter-productive.  Do a fast and sloppy job where it doesn't matter.  Push yourself to focus and work faster.<br><br>This is all pretty basic and common sense - the only thing that I would add that most people don't do is to give yourself a few minutes to think before you do every task about how to do what's on your list in a more efficient way.  Are there steps you can skip, ways you can use your technology to work for you?  Working too hard without taking the time to think about how you're doing that work can be so counter-productive.<br><br>After the dust settles, I'd look at how it happened - is it because you just have too much work to do all the time - which might mean looking at another job or hiring someone to help.  Or is it because you were procrastinating, in which case it might not be the right job for you if you can't make yourself do the tasks in the job.  There's nothing wrong with that, some people just aren't suited for some jobs and they show it by procrastinating.  <br><br>Good luck!</div>

<div class="content">Clive<br><br>Let others know sooner rather than later that you can't deliver on time.  <br><br>If you work for a boss, ask what the priority is.  If he can't decide reduce the timescale, eg what is the priority for today?<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Clive<br><br>One of the things with AF is that it really enables you to identify reasons for procrastination which may be as simple as being bored by routine tasks or be an indication that you are unhappy with your job.  That gives a good pointer to what can be changed and what can't.  <br><br>Although the major benefit of AF is the use of intuition, there is the common sense rule that if something needs doing now then do it now.  Unfortunately with backlogs that can be difficult and time consuming but I dug myself out of specific backlog with AF1 by detailing every little step of that backlog on my list and attacking it vigorously. It did mean that I was not able to work as intuitively as I would have liked but on the basis that this was a "must do now scenario" I would have had to come out of AF anyway.  Using AF meant that I kept everything in one place, maintained my lists (which grew massively before reducing!) and felt more in control (if somewhat bored!!).<br><br>Excellent advice above from Jacqueline and MOK - hope some of it works for you.  Above all - don't panic and remember that things will improve!  And AF is by far and away the best system I have found for managing any of the above scenarios :-)</div>
