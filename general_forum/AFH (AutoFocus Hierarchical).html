<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">It's an idea I've been thinking about for a few days. The idea is to make an expanding list more manageable, and make one think in a "similar, together" way.<br><br>I would be inclined to use software though - this may be beyond what pen and paper can manage.<br><br>So use an outliner program, like ListPro, MLO or OmniFocus, and look at the root level, which might read Work, Home, Play. If you decide to work on Home, move a bookmark line to above Play, move Home to the bottom, and open it up (or in MLO zoom it). This might list Project 1, Project 2, Wash up, Project 3, Feed cat, Project 4. If the cat is noisy you would feed it, so move the bookmark line for this level to above Project 4, and move Feed cat to the bottom of this level.<br><br>The idea is to treat each level as independent AF4 lists, each with an open and closed section. So that if one is working on a work project one sees only relevant things, tidy sock drawer would not show up (the similar together part).<br><br>No I haven't tried it yet, AF4 does seem to be working for me, but it is sub-optimal to have to read through a long, partially crossed out list every time I get to the end of the Open list.<br><br>Has anyone tried something similar?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Laurence,<br><br>I'm not sure how similar you think this is, but I was playing on Google Tasks last night (available through my GMail account). <br><br>Tasks allows you to organise a hierarchical outline and to easily move the tasks around the outline. So I was able to play with an outline sorted by importance.<br><br>The feature I liked was the ability to add due dates to any of the tasks in the outline. You can then sort the list by due date. This 'flattens' the list and shows the dated tasks at the top. Within each due date it keeps the ordering of your original outline, so if your outline was sorted by importance, so will your tasks for the day be.<br><br>I was contemplating keeping a master list in the outline together with relevant due dates, then sorting by due date and using an AF-like run through the list top to bottom to see what stands out. Then, AF2-like, I would go to the top of the list again each time I had worked on a task.<br><br>My hope, and reason for posting, is that this would bring open and pressing tasks to the fore. Unless the overhead of maintaining an outline kills the idea before it starts.<br><br><br>Matt</div>

<div class="content">You could do this manually by keeping separate lists for home, work and play.</div>

<div class="content">I've been doing "something" like this from the beginning.  But I don't do it in exactly that way.<br><br>I have my life divided up into "areas", which corresponds to your idea.  For each "area" I do my planning and pick out tasks that I want to do.  Those get dumped into my AF list in no particular order.  I don't see any virtue of "doing" by "area", if you get what I mean.  IOW, why would I want to do health related tasks all in a row.  What I would more likely want to do is all tasks related to a PROJECT, all in a row.  So that is what I do.  I have "build deck" as the entry on my list, rather than "pick up hammer".  That would be too GTD for me ;-)  I decide that I want to do deck building tasks based on the weather, my mood, the time of day, etc.  Likewise, I have "read" on my list, but don't specify the books.  I have those on a reading list and pick from that list.  Or if I were to be studying Spanish, I might have "Spanish" on the list  and then decide if I am going to learn vocabulary, phrases, or whatever.  But I would NOT have a section on my list of "Do fun things".  I just don't think that way, I guess ;-)</div>

<div class="content">It's possible to have multiple AF lists, but as for the hierarchy I think most projects that might appear in this are better off done in sequence.  This means an AF3 method of processing would work better for the details.  Or what I've considered:  Having separate lists for project work, and in each project I have:<br><br>1. Working Set.  Selected tasks that I'm working on currently.  I work on any I choose to, and as appropriate cycle among them.<br>2. Inactive Set.  All other project tasks, which I am not yet working on.  I move something from here to the Working Set only when there's nothing in the Working Set I can do.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks all for the interesting feedback. I've been mulling it over during the day, and realized that the review process would not work so well on an outlined list - if there are multiple AF4 sublists that means multiple reviews (for each closed list part). I think Mark's simple review process is crucial, and can't figure out how it can work together with a list divided into outline branches. Alison: I take your point, what I had in mind was an outline with multiple levels, branches from branches from branches, so Home would itself divide into sublists which might do likewise.<br><br>So for now, in spite of all temptation, I remain an AF4-ian (using paper and pen).</div>

<div class="content">Laurence - I wonder if you could do this using Mind Mapping?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Alison, interesting thought, I can see that might work, with one of those software mind-mapping programs, thanks.</div>

<div class="content">If you go that way, look into MindManager with the add on ResultsManager.  RM scans the mind map to produce a list of action items by priority, date ... all the expected things.</div>

<div class="content">If you aren't sure at this point that mind mapping is really for you, you might want to try one of the free mind mapping tools before making the significant financial investment in MindManager.  MindManager does have a free trial though.<br><br>XMind:  <a href="http://www.xmind.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.xmind.net/</a> <br><br>FreeMind: <a href="http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page</a></div>

<div class="content">>> but it is sub-optimal to have to read through a long, partially crossed out list every time I get to the end of the Open list <<<br><br>If this is your main problem with a long list, I believe almost any task/todo software would help. They would have options to filter/see either "Active" tasks or "Completed" tasks or both. Viewing "Active" tasks would show only tasks not yet done, in a much shorter list.<br><br>I usually view only "Active" tasks when doing AF4 on my Windows Mobile Outlook tasks.</div>

<div class="content">Laurence:<br><br><< it is sub-optimal to have to read through a long, partially crossed out list every time I get to the end of the Open list >><br><br>If you use the vertical line method to join completed tasks it takes hardly any longer to read. See <a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2009/7/23/autofocus-2-sample-page.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2009/7/23/autofocus-2-sample-page.html</a> (Note that only paras 3 and 4 of the accompanying notes apply to AF4)<br><br>Besides. seeing the crossed out items can be very motivating. It gives a much greater sense of progress than just a contextless list.</div>

<div class="content">What Mark said.  That line makes it a snap to jump right to the open items.  I tried putting a box in front of each item and checking it off.  That was not enough for me.  Then I tried filling it in ... better, but finally I connected the filled in boxes when adjacent tasks were done then I finally relized that what I had was really just a thick line.  No matter how you manage it, just make it visually outstanding enough so your eye jumps to the tasks that are not complete.<br><br>Using software I love the ability to filter.  The problem is that I have yet to find a combination of software and technology that makes it as simple to enter data as just writing it down.  Perhaps if I were tied to a desk so I could use a keyboard?  In any case, my iPhone is a pain to input data into and most applications don't have a decent interface to PC files.<br><br>There is one more thing to be said about pen and paper, the time spent writing it causes me (at least) to think more about the task.  I find my self rewording the task before I complete writing it, sometimes.  Also, the rewriting of a worked on but incomplete task benefits from additional thinking as I rewrite. I don't find that I think as much when I type as when I write.  I'm not sure why that is, but there 'ya go.</div>

<div class="content">Mike:<br><br><< I don't find that I think as much when I type as when I write. >><br><br>I think there's also something about the written words themselves that is more engaging. Typed stuff is just too clinical for something as personal as a task list. I find I can relate much better to all the irregularities of a written, amended, crossed-out, etc, list.<br><br>In the photo of the example page, I wouldn't have had anything like the motivation or emotional investment to get that page finished if I had just been presented with a typed list:<br><br>"Vertigo"<br>"Les Destinees Sentimentales"<br>Flickr<br><br>At least that's my story and I'm sticking to it!</div>

<div class="content">I have always felt that typing was just pushing a bunch of pieces of plastic when I am doing it.  It isn't information or data until I read it on the screen.  Writing feels different.  At the same time I am putting ink to paper I am creating the message, recording the data and thinking about what information is coming next.  With typing I'm thinking about which key to press next.<br><br>It's just different.  The keyboard is mechanical.  Handwriting is personal.  I feel ownership.  Anyone can press the keys and replicate what I typed with virtually no effort or thought.  No one can really tell who typed it.  If someone is to duplicate (i.e., forge) something I wrote by hand they have to think and concentrate and are actually duplicating something I physically created.  It isn't just the information.<br><br>Now maybe that personal ownership of my tasks is why I find it so hard to dismiss.  That's a different issue!</div>

<div class="content">I like writing my AF list by hand, for all the same reasons already mentioned.  <br><br>But for other kinds of writing, my hand just gets too tired.  I think my writing suffers as a result -- it's somehow ungrounded, less heartfelt, too abstract.  I wish I knew a good way around this problem.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>Stick to it ;-)  Another example is mind mapping.  I like that as a way of organizing information.  There are some good programs to do it for you and produce something very neat.  They also allow you to add flags, pictures, connect to documents, etc.  Very powerful.  Yet if you go back to Tony Buzan's basic description, he focuses on the power of the personal nature of the visual representation.  Drawings, colors, stylized lines, etc.  His point, the WHOLE point behind mind mapping, is that a picture is worth a thousand words.  So the software implementations of mind mapping actually undermine its real value.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim,<br><br>I suffer from the same problem.  My hand writing is horribly cramped and my hand aches after a short time.  I mostly letter to overcome this a bit.  I'm told that the problem is that I never learned to write correctly in the first place.  Apparently, it has to do with knowing how to hold the pen and position the hand in a relaxed way so that you don't tighten up the muscles.  Now that I'm thinking about it, I may search for a writing course to see if I can improve.<br><br>One small step was to write slowly and carefully.  For some reason this relaxed me a bit as well.</div>

<div class="content">I like typing MUCH better than writing.  It's neater, and doesn't leave that messy cluttered appearance that turns me off.  It's finite, regular, editable, and easier than hand-writing.  I only write if one of these are true:<br><br>* I'm free-thinking, planning, and my thoughts won't fit a linear arrangement<br>* I'm drawing diagrams, mindmaps, etc.<br>* I'm editing a document that requires examining many pages at once<br>* no keyboard is available<br><br>I think it comes down to skill (I'm a fluent 60wpm typist), and left-handedness.  (Lefties find writing much harder than righties.)</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim, Mike,<br><br>It may help to try to involve your shoulder muscles when writing.<br><br>Also a decent gel pen like a Pilot G2, or even a fountain pen may help too.</div>
