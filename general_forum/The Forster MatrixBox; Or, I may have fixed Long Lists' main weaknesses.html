<div class="content">The worst things about Long Lists, in my opinion, are that they seem to gravitate to "easy" and "time waster" tasks to the detriment of harder, more important tasks, and that they seem to have a finicky relationship with "urgent" tasks.  However, my months of using "Task Tracking" have shown me that these weaknesses may actually be related and thus pointed me to a possible joint solution.<br><br>To present the solution properly we have to discuss two key concepts of Mark Forster's thinking: his concept that there are no such things as "procrastination" and "resistance", and his concept of "urgency".<br><br>The first concept is found here: <a href="../blog/Problem 3 - Resistance.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2018/10/13/problem-3-resistance.html</a><br><br>This is the concept of "readiness": the feelings that we have of "resistance" are actually our intuition telling us that "the time is not right to do this", and the times that tasks "stand out" are the times our intuition tells us that "now is the right time to do it".  There is thus no such thing as "procrastination", but only that there are "inappropriate times" to do some things.  <br><br>The problem with this however is that the easiest, most pleasurable things to do tend to be the things most often done because they seem to be always appropriate to do, and the harder, often more important things tend to be left out.  Intuition is stupid like that because it uses the "reward system" of the brain: the pleasure of finishing many easy tasks and doing leisurely tasks are the signals to our intuition that they are the "right thing to do".<br><br>The second concept is discussed here: <a href="../blog/Urgency the natural way to prioritize.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2012/1/26/urgency-the-natural-way-to-prioritize.html</a><br><br>Here Mark Forster introduced the concept that urgency is not to decide when to do a task, but rather it is to decide when to start a task.  I think this is one of his most brilliant concepts because it integrates the traditional concepts of "importance" and "urgency", which is presented best by the "Eisenhower Matrix" or "Eisenhower Box" (<a href="http://jamesclear.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/eisenhower-box-preview.jpg" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://jamesclear.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/eisenhower-box-preview.jpg</a> ), into one.  For example, in the traditional way of thinking, exercise, though important, is not urgent, and therefore it is one of the most often tasks to be not done.   However, using Mark's concept, exercise is one of the most urgent tasks because one has to start doing it consistently to have any benefits from it in the near future.<br><br>Traditional concept of it or not, I think Long Lists have always had a problem handling urgent tasks because it focuses on readiness, not urgency.  And yet I think Mark Forster's concept of urgency, because it also integrates importance, can solve Long Lists' main problem of preferring "time wasters" by adding it as a secondary criterion.<br><br>I therefore introduce the "Forster Box" or "Forster Matrix": <a href="http://i.imgur.com/wEmUT5R.jpg" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://i.imgur.com/wEmUT5R.jpg</a><br><br>The concept here is that once a task in a Long List "stands out" I have to decide using my own intuition whether it is "urgent enough" to do.  If it is, I do it.  If not, then it probably is a "time wasting task" and I should choose another one.  I find that this algorithm has cut down my need to play games, watch vids, read fiction, and other time wasting things, and thus the time I spent in doing more important things have gone up.  As an added bonus, it tells me when I needed to rest by only having leisurely tasks "standing out" after I have gone through the whole list.    <br><br>I have a feeling that using this algorithm with Simple Scanning will make that system the most powerful system to date.  As of right now though I am having way too much fun using Task Tracking to test it.</div>

<div class="content">Ready and Urgent | Not Ready Yet Urgent<br><br>Ready But Not Urgent | Neither Ready Nor Urgent<br><br>I like the concept. If you look at this matrix wholistically assessing your entire workload these two axes are gradiants, not binary. But in the context of simple scanning algorithms, it becomes a binaey decision: does this item get my atttention (if not keep going) and is there good reason (vlaue of action, cost of delay) to get going now (if not, pass it by). <br><br>One more detail, an item might stand out because it’s been languishing and is now isolated, and if you consider its urgency is nil, that’s likely an item to delete.</div>

<div class="content">Christopher: "Is there a time management system other than "Long List" that is good at getting the "important & hard" tasks done?"<br><br>Time-management systems don't get anything done. You do. If important and hard stuff isn't getting done then you need to look inwards. Fix your diet, exercise and sleep so you can think straight. If these aren't addressed then you're permanently swimming against the tide. Pick a few things that are playing on your mind and get stuck into one of them now. You know what they are. Resolve to get it finished, grit your teeth and get it done. It might take a few rounds or a few days or weeks to finish, but finish it. You must finish it.<br><br>If you feel a sense of dread or resistance, that's not a failing of a time-management system, that's you knowing deep down that this task is going to force you to confront something you don't want to confront. It could be related to the task itself or the bigger project from which it is a part, such as needing to clarify what this vague plan is actually all about or where it's heading, and do you really want to go there.<br><br>It's also likely to be something that will expose some aspect of yourself or your life situation which don't want to acknowledge. We all do this, we ignore unpleasant stuff and will it away, then drag it around in our mind like an anchor weighing us down and causing major stress. You have to face these unpleasant things head on and get them solved. Solved hardly ever means perfect, it just means good enough, so don't let some imaginary perfect end state of this unpleasant situation put you off facing it, as that become a wonderful excuse for our internal voice to tell us to keep ignoring it.<br><br>I've found that once this approach is used, the time-management system, if you can even call it that, falls back to being a simple list with a few critical items at the top, a few more to be started shortly, and then everything else to be done or binned as and when.<br><br>nuntym: "The worst things about Long Lists, in my opinion, are that they seem to gravitate to "easy" and "time waster" tasks to the detriment of harder, more important tasks"<br><br>In my own experience that's just another symptom of those tasks forcing us to confront something about the task, project or myself which we'd rather not. If items on that list give you that inner sense of dread as you pass over them for the 100th time you'll never solve it with a time-management system. You have to take those items and face them, start them, finish them, no exceptions.<br><br>Chris</div>

<div class="content">Chris. <br><br>I needed to read your response today. Thanks. There is no silver bullet.   I know I need to grit my teeth and confront the core issues as you say.  But it isn't easy when it feels like there are so many things to confront.  <br><br>To that I say:<br><br>One<br><br>thing<br><br>at<br><br>a<br><br>time.<br><br><br><br>~Brent</div>
