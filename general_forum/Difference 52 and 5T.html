<div class="content">As I've written elsewhere, the plethora of 'systems' has me profoundly confused. I've seen references to both "5/2" and "5T". Are those both the same (as in the book from 2015)? <br>If not, what are the differences, and where can I read more about it?<br><br>BTW, I can't login (as also already written elsewhere), nor can I reset my password.</div>

<div class="content">Nevermind. Meanwhile, I found the answer in the comments in this thread: <br><a href="../fvp_forum/Is the advice in Secrets of Productive People still valid.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/fv-forum/post/2764356</a><br>So they're indeed the same thing under different names.</div>

<div class="content">My backwards interpretation of things is that 5T was common early on, but it became more useful as more no-list systems proliferated to distinguish them based on their capacity and refill threshold, thus giving 5/2 more popularity over time.</div>
