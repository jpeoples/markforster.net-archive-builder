<div class="content">I think I've finally found a way to create a good digital implementation of DWM. In the past, I've experimented with OmniFocus for GTD, but after a while decided on paper, because I can always have that with me. Problem with paper is that after a few days of crossing out completed tasks, my notebook starts looking rather messy. And finding specific tasks is difficult in a paper notebook. Now that I've bought an iPod Touch, I thought to give OmniFocus another try. Turns out the iPhone/iPod implementation of OmniFocus is perfect for DWM.<br><br>I've created a project for setting up daily and weekly routines, and several other projects for tasks that I want to be able to view together occassionally. Al the rest goes into a "misc" project. I've also set up contexts for tasks that I want to be able to view in special locations (errands, things I want to discuss with my husband, calls), all the rest goes in a context "home" or "office" or "anywhere".<br><br>OmniFocus supports a view "Due", and on the iPod this shows up as a list of tasks, grouped by date, i.e., a list of DWM pages. Also, on the iPod you can set a date one week or one month from now with just a single tap. I sync between the iPod and my iMac using a WebDAV-server, which works great. All in all, I think I've finally found a digital implementation I can stick to.<br><br>Oh, and another reason I've ditched previous digital implementations: the Palm TX and the WM-6 device I've tried before all have built-in games that I could not delete. The iPod has no games unless I install them myself. Makes for much less addictive distractions...</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Nicole, I've struggled with OmniFocus and your method works the best.</div>

<div class="content">For my money, OmniFocus is the best, bar none, to do list manager for the iPhone. I looooooove the location feature where I can effectively see what there is I can do that's "nearby".</div>

<div class="content">I have gone back to OmniFocus for both the mac and iPod Touch. I think I am doing it roughly the way you describe. I have one single-action "project" called autofocus and several important projects around the house. I do use many different contexts because it is so easy in OF to enter new tasks into different contexts. What I have done is set up a perspective (saved view) of all of my home contexts grouped by due and sorted by due. About two thirds of my tasks are repeated and I simply tell OF to repeat 7 days after the task is marked done. New tasks are set for one month due and if needed, I assign a repeat scheme of 7 days after it is marked done.<br><br>I use OF because it is nice for heavy duty project management and there are times when I do want to focus on just one context (or project) such as when I go outside to do chores. OF is not cheap and I have it because I really got into GTD a few years ago.</div>
