<div class="content">Since i use Autofocus there is a major problêm about Calls. I think i found a solution that i share with you.<br><br>Calls are my major activities. In my job most of things urgent or important are better done by call. Here is how i proceed. <br><br>Separate tasks and calls : I have a special page for call  and tasks are all together on the next page. <br><br>ex. Call Mr smith 01 02 03 04 05 / for making an appointement next monday about project BOOM)<br><br>- If the call is done then cross the whole line<br><br>- If the call need a following put a  x at the begining and an indicator at the end<br>ex. X Call Mr smith 01 02 03 04 05 / for making an appointement next monday about project / M$ 05/13 (ie i let a message today)<br><br>- the x means ok i done that but i need to follow it<br><br>- Act in Af as usual (2 readings) skipping all x to make your others calls<br><br>The result is a good focus on call and a real efficiency in the treatement of my important and urgent items. <br></div>
