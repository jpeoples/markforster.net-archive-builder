<div class="content">Oh boy -- this is a stupid question coming from a very digital person.  I am writing out my tasks in a new notebook for AF and wanted to know if one is supposed to use both sides of the page -- or just the one side.  I know it is my choice, but what do others do?  Mark, what do you do?  <br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">I use both sides -- seems wasteful not to.</div>

<div class="content">In the flickr group someone photographed their notebook that used the left hand page for the work AF list and the right hand page for the personal AF list (or vice versa). Seems like a good idea if you're separate lists.<br><br>Alternatively you could use the alternative pages and right related notes on the facing page.<br></div>

<div class="content">I thought about doing the facing-pages thing but didn't because both my work and home lists are currently running 4-12 active pages -- but mostly because I want to keep my work life and my home life as separate as possible.  They bleed together enough as it is.<br><br>So, I use a Levenger Circa notebook, compact size with an upsized set of rings and three sections (work AF, home AF, and a third section for general notetaking).<br><br>The Circa system, by the way, has another really nice side-effect.  As I finish pages, I just remove them and add more blank pages as necessary.  This way, I can limit the overall bulk of the notebook by not carrying around pages that are no longer useful.</div>

<div class="content">On the video, you can see that Mark uses both sides of the paper.  His book looks very neat and tidy.  <br><br>I only use one side - the right - I use the left side for writing general stuff like:<br>- projected monthly costs for my reno project<br>- time guesstimates for the reno<br>- packing list for my recent ski trip<br>- financial doodling / projections<br>- place to put various post-it notes<br>- measurements for appliances I want to buy or room sizes<br>- library book list<br>- grocery lists<br>- confirmation numbers for payments<br>All very miscellaneous stuff.<br><br>I started off using both sides, but I lost track of where I was more easily with both sides and it helps to focus me - my attention would wander over to the other page when I had my book open when I used both sides. <br>Also, if you want to eventually clip/fold over the top to mark where you are with active pages, you can't do that if you used both sides.<br></div>

<div class="content">Since my work notebook (A5, which is about half US letter size) has only 25 lines, I use two-page spreads as AF 'pages'. This is especially useful since some entries take more than one line and I have *lots* of 'Waiting fors' (in GTD parlance) among my items. <br><br>I do the same in my Pocket Moleskine Volant that I use for personal tasks, which has only 22 lines (and even less space pre line, so I often need two lines for one entry there as well). <br><br>However, I wonder if this might add another layer of resistance, which could be one of the reasons why my AF experience isn't quite as smooth as many people report here.</div>

<div class="content">Similar to Dave, I also use the right hand page for the list and the left hand page for notes, supplementary information and phone numbers etc...</div>

<div class="content">I use both sides of the pages.  I use graph paper and write my list beginning on the third square to the right.  When I'm working on something I mark it by beginning the cross-out line as Mark suggested.  When I finish the task, I cross it out the rest of the way.  When I have a number of tasks crossed off on a page, I can do a broken vertical line between the first to squares of crossed out tasks (as someone on this forum suggested).  This allows the unfinished tasks to jump out more clearly.<br><br>I also use a Circa notebook, but have taken out a divider between my home and work lists and now have "one list to rule them all."  So far, it's working for me and I don't have to think about which list to add something to (like errands).<br><br>I have two sections: The front is AF.  The back is other lists (gift ideas, books to read, etc) and journaling.  Like Steve, I also like the ability to discard used pages and insert blank ones as needed.  If I ever need to set up a separate AF list for a project or want to divide my work/home list again it's no problem.</div>

<div class="content">I feel the need to pipe up, since I was the one using the facing pages for personal and work items... I have since abandoned this and gone to the front and back of one book method (work items entered in the front, personal in the back).  I simply have many more personal tasks jotted down and so the page-flipping was beginning to make me a bit mad.  If you add items at roughly the same rate, though, it would work brilliantly.</div>

<div class="content">I am also using a Circa notebook, the smaller size one, and using both sides of the pages. I like the Circa paper as it is thick enough that highlighting does not bleed through. (I use blue highlighting for completed items and orange for dismissed items... just makes it easier for me to see what is left on the page.) I guess the paper is "Cornell note-taking style" with a 1.5" blank column on the left, and then ruled with 29 lines on the right, which I like. I use the blank column for little notes sometimes and also to note the date a task has been completed. Since the beginning of the beta I've just used one list for both home and work issues, but have been seriously thinking of splitting them apart, and adding Home/Work dividers into my Circa! Another thing I like about Circa is that I can insert an "index card" when I want and then remove it when it's no longer relevant. Very handy. I've also started keeping some "extras" in my Circa AF book, like my Wish List, Things to Buy, Dreams, Project List, some Financial Info, etc etc. I really like the flexibility of Circa and being able to easily add or take out pages/cards... it can also be very compact (unlike a 3-ring binder system, even a small one.)</div>

<div class="content">I'm wondering if anyone has used the method I suggested way back in the forum of entering Work items from the top of the page downwards and Home items from the bottom of the page upwards, then drawing a line where they meet and treating it as one page for all purposes except dismissing items. You don't dismiss the Home items on a page when you're at Work, or the Work items on a page when you are at Home.<br><br>Since I only have one location for both Work and Home, I haven't been able to try it out myself.</div>

<div class="content">No Mark, I haven't tried the down/up approach for work/home since just been focusing on the work aspect although I did try a seperate notebook for home but did not follow through with it.  Now that AF at work has feels like it is now a habit I will give the suggestion a go.<br>With respect to paper usage, I use both sides, shame to waste one.  I only use highlighters to dismiss, entries go in pen, the completed line through in pencil and I love the suggestion to add a vertical line through the cross out in the margin since it provides a visual enhancement over what is completed and what is left. The added benefit it this it speeds up my counting at the end of the day which a use to track progress. <br>Regards</div>

<div class="content">David:<br><br>I'll be interested to hear how you get on with the down/up approach. Remember it was only a suggestion!</div>

<div class="content">I tried the down/up approach for a while. Then I gave up and went back to a mixed list. <br><br>I work from home and tried it during a period when work was light, so I would have about a third of a page or less work items under the line. I didn't like only having 10 or less items on a virtual work page. I also didn't like the fact that I read the list downwards, but had entered the items from the bottom up.<br><br>Since then I have taken on a lot more work, and have switched to a separate notebook for work as I really need to block off time. Also I am taking my work notebook into meetings and want it to look professional!  I may switch back if I get another light period (although hopefully autofocus will help me prevent that), but don't think I'd try the down/up approach again. The benefit of one list is that if procrastinating when I should have been doing paid work, I was more likely to pick a "house" job than just spend time on  mindless surfing. <br><br>Kate<br></div>

<div class="content">Kate,<br><br>Just a thought ... if you are one of those people who are getting lots of things done, one who people go to for help and information, they will all be staring at your notebook wondering if you can tell them how they can use a notebook like that to be as efficient as you.  ;-)  IOW, professional is more in the result than the look of the method.  I know many people who are extraordinarily neat but get little accomplished.<br><br>As to the home v. work thing ... I work at home as well so I have things mixed.  I have been thinking, of late, if I might not like some separation between work and house chores.  IOW, there are times when I am just in a mood to get out the mop or maybe tools to fix something and it's a pain to find the items.  So far, not a huge problem because with the frequent scans, I kind of know what is to be done.  But I'm thinking about another tweak ... but holding off because many of my other tweaks were eventually backed out.</div>
