<div class="content">I don't have an iPhone, but have had a look at this web site.<br><br>Happiness Tracker??!!??  Believe me, I love IT and sometimes have to clear out various applications that I've tried out and find out I just don't really need.  I'm also a fairly avid reader, cannot go to sleep unless I've read my current book (currently "Billy Ruffian, the story of HMS Bellerophon and her part in Napoleon Bonaparte's downfall").<br><br>But this application made me realise why I have gone back to manual/paper (probably long-term this time) for DWM.  I spend so much time at my notebook or netbook that I need a creative or even a routine break from bits and bytes,  Writing things down and processing DWM is almost refreshing, I certainly focus more with the manual/paper mode.<br><br>Although I now have a netbook for some uses, I still find an A5/Moleskine Large notebook the most convenient for my circumstances.<br><br>To each her/his own.</div>

<div class="content">Roger, the happiness tracker is a research app that asks you to track your mood and circumstances for a few weeks. It was pretty enlightening for me and it was great that it was only for a short time.</div>

<div class="content"><<No technology involved! >><br><br>But that's the point... the technology ACTS as a motivating force. Readmore turns reading into a video game of sorts. I'm finding it useful.</div>
