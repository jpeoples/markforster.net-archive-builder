<div class="meta">2009-03-1 12:48</div>
<div class="content">Yesterday I was looking at my filing system, which is a constant source of trouble for me. It needs so much maintaining, more than I am giving it, and therefore it's always a mess, which makes me even more unwilling to put efforts in it... I really would love to learn of a system that handles all the paper/tax/bookkeeping/letters/newspaperclippings/etc. stuff the way AF handles task management!<br><br>Two glimpses of hope: I have developed two principles that help me to keep the mess lower than I deserve it. They are, in a way, self organizing things, and I'd like to present them here in the hope that maybe someone has something to add.<br><br>1. AUTOCLEAN: Handles all private bills, receipts, whatever - all these amounts of printed papers you collect around the stuff you buy for your household and most likely never need again, except one time in five years, but then urgently! (For example, something gets broken on which you still have guarantee: Now go and find the bill to prove it.)<br><br>I decided to put all these papers into one hanging folder, labeled RECEIPTS, BILLS, SALES SLIPS. "Put" means: I simply throw everything in and don't care for it anymore. My experience is that I need something out of this folder on a rate of once a year at the most: So, its better not to put the effort into a neat filing but in searching the place where it has to be - somewhere - once I should need it. (Once you need it, the motivation is sufficiently higher anyway ;-D)<br><br>OK - but this folder would grow, grow, grow! So I installed a second one, labeled OLD RECEIPTS ETC. The folder is full after two years. So, on new years morning of every odd year, I throw everything that is in to OLD folder in the paper basket (without looking at it) and EXCHANGE it with the other (I exchange the labels as well, of course). Now, I have an empty folder to fill again for two other years.<br><br>This little routine allows to find everything of the last 2 years minimum, which had been sufficient for more than 10 years now, and keeps this part of my filing system clean.<br><br>2. AUTOORDER: I use magazine files for my projects, for preparation of holidays, for everything else that includes paperwork. (I use a system called MAPPEI, <a href="http://www.mappei.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.mappei.net</a> ) The file folders stand in boxes and are labeled on the top, so I can find everything quickly.<br><br>The problem is that the number of file folders grow over time. You start with one box, which is full one day, so you need a second etc. To keep it manageable, you need to put things out. You have to identify file folders you don't need anymore to throw them away, or you need at least not so often that you have to have them at your desk but elsewhere.<br><br>I used to have file folders of the same type together, ordered alphabetically: All writing projects in these boxes, travel preparations in another box, computer stuff in another etc. But I gave up this system when I came across a great idea: Someone suggested to have one box (the one on my desk) as the Main Box, and whenever I take one file folder out somewhere, I put it back into the Main Box, and IN FRONT OF ALL OTHER FOLDERS THAT ARE IN IT.<br><br>This way, the folders order themselves! I always have the most recent folders in front of me, the ones I will most likely need again. Once I don't need a file anymore, it moves slowly into the back, and once the Main Box gets full, I only have to move the last ones out; they go into my other boxes on the shelf. In front, of course. (And once these are full, I can throw away the last ones!)<br><br>===<br><br>These are my 2 little tricks - but I would like to know more of them. More tricks how to get things to do themselves!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Andreas<br><br>It sounds as though what you are looking for are admin systems and project management systems, which as you correctly define are outside of AF although ideally managed by AF.  They are major subjects in themselves - with many many books written on the subject!<br><br>I assume you are working from home so have the final say in how you organise things and without going into a lot of detail on systems themselves the best advice I would give is to make sure that you find a system that is "right for you", and is tailored to your specific requirements AND method of working.  Use AF to help you think through what you need - add tasks like "think about filing system".  <br><br>A few practical tips? It is common for digital files to end up in as many obscure places as pieces of paper.  Having a consistent structure for types of filing facilitates retrieval in whatever format.  If you imagine you are advising a client in this field, ask yourselves the questions a consultant maight ask you.  Remember your needs are unique - don't assume because a system works for Fred next door it will work for you - and don't be influenced by sales people who want to sell you a "one size fits all" system! <br><br>Finally there are a few specific tips regarding dealing with paper and email in the forum.  You will find links to them in the FAQ's below<br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/645945" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/645945</a><br><br>Hope that helps ..... :-)</div>

<div class="content">I createa an A - Z filing system using manila folders. The secret to success is having lots of fles with a specific purpose. So instead of having a folder labelled BILLS, I have folders labelled Electricy, Gas, Telephone, etc.   I got this idea from David Allen's Getting Things Done book. I wrote about it and included some photos:<br><a href="http://members.optusnet.com.au/~charles57/GTD/AZFiling/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://members.optusnet.com.au/~charles57/GTD/AZFiling/index.html</a><br><br>In Mark Forsters's Do it Tomorrow he recommends using Lever Arch (standing) files to put on a bookshelf. <br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">For me Autoclean is the way to go.  I have two Lever Arch (standing) files marked 2009 and 2008 for bills and receipts.  2007 is now moved out of sight for five years.  Envelopes are always opened on reception (... although).  Bills to pay go into a red folder in the inbox. As using the lever arch system directly is sometimes to much effort, there is also a green folder ready to hold the papers until correctly put away.</div>

<div class="content">Charles:<br><br>What is the advantage of having rather lots of files with specific purposes? Aren't you constantly busy labeling folders this way?<br><br>Being a writer, I am collecting lots of clips from newspapers, magazines etc. My approach is to just collect anything that "rings a bell in me" (or "stands out" :-D) and throw it in a large folder. After a while, this folder is bursting with paper. Then I have a session where I sit on the floor, having the content of the folder before me, and try to group what I have. Usually I find most of the items fitting easily together, because they are about subjects I am interested in, so I end up with a dozen piles that can be stowed away under labels like "ecosystem", "archaeology" or "spacecrafts". About 20% of the collected material however resists ordering - so I let it in the large folder for the next time. Might be until next time these lonely items will have found sisters and brothers...<br><br>The beauty of that AUTOARCHIVE approach is that you don't have to have a predefined structure. YOU'LL FIND OUT what you're interested in on the way. In my first session I was surprised to find that I have a strong interest in bizarre numbers and statistics; I wasn't aware of that!<br><br>I have, however, neglected to take care of my archive for a long time. I've created the task *ARCHIVE SESSION* now on my AF list...</div>

<div class="content">Andreas E,<br><br>> What is the advantage of having rather lots of files with specific purposes? <br><br>My three drawer filing cabinet is a reference filing system.  The advantage<br>of having many clearly labelled files allows rapid retrieval and minimal<br>time spent lookig for the required document.  My family uses the filing<br>cabinet as well, for example, last night my daughter wanted to find<br>her school report of 3 years ago. She went to the cabinet, found<br>the "Katie - Year 8 file" and got what she wanted.<br>'<br>>Aren't you constantly busy labeling folders this way?<br><br>No. I would probably only create a handful of new files each month.<br>I have a catchall "Finance" folder which is where new bills are placed<br>ready for payment. Once I have paid it, I file it in the appropriate file<br>in the cabinet.<br><br>I have another folder "Project support" which sits on my desk and holds<br>papers not related to other projects with files.<br><br>I strive to keep my inbox empty which I think is an excellent GTD principle.<br>Another goal is to minimise paper, so I try and process stuff promptly<br>and get rid of it, for example scanning newspaper articles of interest<br>(that aren't published on the web!).<br><br>Charles</div>

<div class="content">Some things I do along these lines:<br><br>1) Manage bills electronically.  Use your bank as your filing system.  You can now get eBills from lots of places.  You can instruct your bank to pay by the due date and just review to see if you have a problem each month before that date.  You can go paperless with many companies ... they will email you the bill or you can get it from their site.<br><br>2) When you buy a gizmo, go to the company website and see if they have the manual in PDF format.  If so, download and file it.  Throw away some of the manuals and such.  Do you REALLY need an operating manual on your toaster?<br><br>3) Rip out the English section of manuals and throw away all the other languages.  (Unless you like reading multilingual transliterations for fun ;-)<br><br>4) Keep a file for things that you will possibly return.  Think about it though.  Are you really likely to take a company up on its "lifetime warranty" for an item that cots $5.00?  I would not.  The postage alone would not make it worth it to get a replacement and often you'd want something better after a few years anyway.  That being the case, the file can stay small.<br><br>5) Keep a separate file (usually an envelope) for short term receipts.  IOW, if something has a 60 day return, put it in that envelop so you can purge it after that time.<br><br>6) Scan receipts and statements.  I got a Fujitsu ScanSnap and it works like a charm to scan everything.  I "file" the pape, after scan,r in a box for destruction later.  I don't immediately shred because ... well, because computers are unreliable.  (But see above, most statements are available for download now so you don't really even have to scan any more.)  But if you do that, back up your files to CD or DVD periodically.<br><br>7) Purge your files continually.  I keep a tall colored marker that I move through the files.  When I have a free moment I pull a file and purge it, then move the marker along.  That way file maintenance does not become a big project to be dreaded.<br><br>6) Separate current files from archive files.  IOW, you are going to access the file for your electric company monthly so keep it in your bottom desk drawer along with mortgage, phone, etc.  Other files are accessed only yearly or less frequently so can be more out of the way.  Others are simply for protection ... old taxes are like this ... save for six years in case of an audit.  They can be in the garage or basement in boxes with the "destroy date" marked on the box.<br><br>Just some ideas.</div>

<div class="content">Mike - are you serious?  I should throw out the operating manual on my toaster?!!!!<br><br>Great ideas and tips there!</div>

<div class="content">Christine,<br><br>Yeah, and perhaps the hair dryer and curling iron as well.  (Do women still use those?)  But do think about it.  I'm looking for the manual on my bicycle.  Mostly bikes are bikes but mine is collapsible and I want the manual to see about how to secure it when It is back together.  I know it is around here somewhere ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Mike<br><br>Don't laugh but I've got about three boxes of manuals floating around - I think I need to get rid........ <br><br>But it does remind that I set an AF task to set up a "What is Where?" project to produce a meaningful (and probably deep) list of stuff.  This came about because of a simple little task to "replace bulb in lamp".  Now this simple little task developed a mind of it's own and having completed about 6 tasks, including buying said bulb, finding that unscrewing the bulb merely unscrewed the glass bit, leaving the metal screw part firmly stuck inside the lamp, requiring me to locate pliers (which I could not - hence my new project!), finally removing the rest of the bulb, replacing it (still not working) replacing fuse (to no avail), which I guess leaves me with the task "find manual"   ..... hmmmmmmm!</div>

<div class="content">Manuals: We have a big drawer where all manuals for all gadgets go in. (We don't have that many, I must say.) Long years I followed to rule to keep every manual near the item it concerned, but that was often difficult - especially as electronic devices started to shrink and manuals started to grow :-) - and actually not necessary. To know that if you need a manual, you'll find it in one place, that's enough.<br><br>But scanning documents in order to archive them... I don't know. From time to time, I hear people telling about it, but I haven't seen such a system in action and can't imagine its advantages. For me, there is no simpler way to handle a piece of paper than dropping it into a hanging folder. A second, and it's done.</div>

<div class="content">I have to say I agree with Mike regarding scanning and scan most stuff now - but I still keep the paper!  The thing that really struck me reading Mike's post, was "what if there's a power cut" or some sort of disaster obliterates my files and backups ......  I suspect that, whilst there's a degree of common sense to that thought, it is also heavily influenced by my reluctance to get rid of stuff ...... something AF is also making me aware of!  Where I find scanning a real benefit is that all of my stuff is at hand without having to go to a file - if I am on the phone and need to refer to something it is right on my screen - if I need an article I can find it ....<br><br>Mike - some great tips there</div>

<div class="meta">2009-03-4 20:01</div>
<div class="content">Thanks Christine,<br><br>And two more tips for you ...<br><br>1) If you have a bulb separate again, use a potato to get it out, not pliers.  Cut the potato, jam it into the socket and twist.  The jagged parts of the broken base wiill be caught by the potato and zip, it usually comes right out ... with less chance of damaging something.<br><br>2) (And this is one I have to keep reminding myself of) the internet is a source of infinite "tips".  Open Google and ask a question and, likely as not, someone has written an article on "making your own cleaning solutions" or "what season is best to prune a Japanese Maple" or "how do you deadhead roses" or ... it is actually pretty amazing.  I try to remember to make it my first stop before I tire out my poor brain ;-)<br><br>Re: Scanning ... yeah, it all depends.  I personally find that I can locate a PDF with a Google desktop search more quickly (and the proper location in the manual with CTL-F) than trudging upstairs to the file cabinet, locating the folder, finding the right manual, searching the index, etc.  But then that is just me.<br><br>As to keeping manuals where they are needed, that makes loads of sense ... except ... where is that, exactly.  I mean, the manual for the rice cooker (which I'm always needing to look up cooking  times) should be on the kitchen counter ... but who really wants that?</div>

<div class="content">If all you need from the manual is the cooking times, maybe you could rip that page out of the manual (or type up a separate chart) and tape it up inside a cabinet near the rice cooker. Easily accessible but out of the way. :)</div>

<div class="content">For me, the problem is that you never have enough screen space. I can easily lay out fiv square meters of printed paper around me, look here and there and have everything at hand while working on the computer, but if research material has to be on the screen, too, then it becomes difficult. Sometimes I even print out things I have digitally (I have a lot, too, of course) to have them lay beside me.<br><br>And - I can more easily work with paper: Highlight parts, make notes, scribble wherever I like. No software is as easy as a pen on paper.<br><br>Only storage space would be an argument. Thinking about how much printed paper may fit into a hard disc the size of a cigar box... But I guess I'd have to hire somebody to feed my cubicmeters of archives in :-)</div>
