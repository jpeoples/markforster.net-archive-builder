<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-09-2 14:18</div>
<div class="content">Hi Mark and All,<br><br>I have been quiet for some time now as have been extraordinarily busy.  I still am, but I have had an epihany of sorts as of late last night.  I agree with Mark -- the versions of AF after the original just have not had the same effect on me.  I am not as excited to use them.  Another major issue is that I have been finding myself spending too much time on the urgent and not the important.  So many urgencies that come my way are other people's urgencies and not mine.  Most really can wait.  <br><br>So, I have decided to go back to the orginal AF and regain the excitement I had with what I consider still a brilliant and captivating system.  As for tasks that are truly urgent and need to be done today -- I have a category in Outlook called "red zone actions" and that is at the top of the list.  My AF list will stay in my simple, spiral-bound notebook.  Plus, I just use my common sense -- as Mark has always said -- if it HAS to be done now -- I just do it!<br><br>When Mark's new system comes out -- and what he is reporting now, it sounds fantastic -- I am sure I will switch over and give it a try.  But for now -- for me -- it is back to the original Autofocus.<br><br>Best wishes,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">I wish you luck. I found it almost impossible to go back to AF1 after using AF2 and RAF, even though I think it would probably be best for my way of working.<br><br>I am now working very well with RAF, but it took some time to get used to the system and to train myself to switch to AF1/Forward Mode frequently enough that I feel the Important stuff isn't getting left behind.<br><br>Hopefully, AF4 will be a big improvement on RAF, and emphasize AF1 more than AF2.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Wooba.  Actually, I am finding it quite easy to go back to the original AF.  As I said, I have a good way of tracking truly urgent items, complete with reminders too in Outlook in addition to "red zone actions".  <br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">I'm only trying RAF since one week (after using the original AF for more than 6 months) and I'm also feeling that the new system has me mostly reacting to current urgencies and requests rather than promoting the balanced view and approach as AF1 did. I'm sorely tempted to revert to AF1 straight away, but I'm forcing myself to at least give RAF a try for another week or so. But it's proving hard. As you say David, the original AF had me excited (most of the time anyway) whereas RAF somehow doesn't feel as right.<br><br>Which also prompts this request to Mark: even if another revision of AF would finally materialise, could you please ensure that the original AF remains available on your site (as well as AF2 and RAF for those who liked these better)?</div>

<div class="content">I switched to RAF quite soon after I was introdused to the system, but I must admit I found AF1 more intuitive. I also use Outlook Calendar for tasks with a hard date and recurring items which I don't want to clog up AF with. It's about as simple a system as I have managed to now, maybe the new version will improve on this further. I wait in anticipation!<br><br></div>

<div class="content">I'm finding that the new system is even more addictive than AF1. In fact I am getting up early and going to bed late just so I can keep going with it!</div>

<div class="content">As posted elsewhere on this site, I had difficulties with AF2 and had switched back to AF1. When RAF emerged I found it more exciting - but I do spend the majority of my time in 'forward mode' ie: mostly AF1 behavour.<br><br>When in 'reverse mode' (the default mode) I too find myself focused on recently added tasks at the expense of older but important tasks.<br><br>I look forward to seeing AF4 in action - good luck Mark!<br><br>Paul<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Just wanted to chime in here that I'm also still using AF1. When I started using some of the newer ideas, I realized that I had singleton items two pages back that weren't getting done, and I thought the idea of writing down to go backwards a little odd.<br><br>My favorite part of AF1 is the procrastination-breaker of even if I start that task two pages back, I write it down again at the end, so I can close that page. Typically just in starting it, I can either complete it, or what I write down is the next step that task needs.<br><br>I'm also going to try using TaskPaper and AF1 with the creation date  of new pages as project names, and a fixed window length for pages instead of my trusty notebook. AF has really enhanced my ability to do work. Thank you, Mark.</div>

<div class="content">Borgendorf:<br><br>You'll be relieved to hear that the new version does not involve going backwards!</div>

<div class="content">After just 7 working days using the revised AF (at work only), I'm getting so unconfortable with it, that this morning I decided to stop the test and revert back to the original AF. With a big sense of relief ;)<br><br>My main concerns about RAF are, as mentioned above, that I spend most of my time on urgent, recent items. But even more, that the "middle pages" don't get visited anymore, and I'm starting to forget what's in them. In AF1, you cycle through the pages on a regular basis, so you always keep the overview, while in RAF I lost that.<br><br>So now, in anticipation of the "ultimate" AF ;o) I'm back to where it all started.</div>
