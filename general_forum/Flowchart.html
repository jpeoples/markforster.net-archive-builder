<div class="content">I've created a flowchart to give a visual representation of Autofocus. Despite the simplicity of the system, charting it was a lot harder than I thought. I've put it here for the time being:<br><br><a href="http://darklingwood.typepad.com/autofocus.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://darklingwood.typepad.com/autofocus.pdf</a><br><br>Mark, I hope I'm not treading on any copyright issues in doing this. I've included a pointer to your site. It was primarily to get my own head straight concerning that first pass versus subsequent passes question. If there's a problem, let me know.<br><br>Otherwise, hope it helps someone. (And if there are any errors in the flow, let me know and I'll try to fix).<br><br>Tommy<br></div>

<div class="content">Nice chart! I didn't know you could do that in Excel (at least it says "Excel" in the document properties). <br><br>The path "Are there undismissed items remaining onthe page? -> No -> Is this the last page? -> No -> Dismiss any remaining items on this page" sounds a little counter intuitive, but it is valid (in the last step, zero actions will be dismissed) and you would need a third "Is this the last page?" decision to remedy this, which would complicate things unnecessarily.<br><br>Okay, enough nitpicking. Great chart! And I don't think that it poses a copyright infringement, but evidentially I am no expert.</div>

<div class="content">@Andreas,<br><br>> The path ... sounds a little counter intuitive ... and you would need a third ...<br><br>Exactly! :-)<br>In fact that third decision was in there but I spotted a way of taking it out by changing "Dismiss all remaining items ..." to "Dismiss any remaining items ..." to allow for the possibility that there are no items left to dismiss.<br><br>t<br><br>P.S. Yes, it's Excel (2007).<br></div>

<div class="content">I love this chart - as an engineer it really appeals!<br><br>I have one query - the first box says "Go to earliest active page", but I am sure I have read on a couple of threads that you should continue from where you left off (say, the third active page), and not return to the start each morning (or each time you work on the list).<br><br>Can anyone clarify this?<br><br>In other news, despite my wobbly start (<a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/648957)," rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/648957),</a> I've now been using my home AF list since 5th January and it's *finally* working for me. It's made me rethink exactly how I spend my time outside of work. I now have smaller tasks, focussed on a smaller range of goals, confident that in the long run the things I have now dismissed (awful high resistance items!!) will either be more appropriate in the future or won't ever need doing. I've been exercising loads more, and getting lots of niggly little jobs done. It's been an amazing tool in helping me evaluate just what on earth I've been doing with myself all this time (not the things needed to achieve my goals, that's for sure).<br><br>At work, it just worked. At home, it's taken a bit of perseverance, but I've finally got the hang of it. Hurrah!</div>

<div class="content">Tommy,<br><br>I like this a lot. Thanks.<br><br>When I print it, the white letters in the blue boxes are difficult to read. Can you do this with a larger font while still keeping it to a single page?</div>
