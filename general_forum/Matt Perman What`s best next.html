<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2014-03-8 16:46</div>
<div class="content">I would like to call to your attention a new book from Matt Perman: What's Best Next: How the Gospel Transforms the Way You Get Things Done. I have been watching Matt`s blog since I found very interesting post on how he approached (and adapted) GTD. (<a href="http://whatsbestnext.com/2010/08/getting-things-done-to-the-next-level/)" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://whatsbestnext.com/2010/08/getting-things-done-to-the-next-level/)</a><br><br>I am almost done with first quick reading. Although first part of the book (religious connection to time/life management) is a little bit too lengthy and repetitive for me (I have not learnt so much new what I would not have realized before about spiritual/christian view of designing your life) and there are sometimes too many biblical references and quotes to the same point, still Matt brings some very interesting conclusions here. <br><br>But the second part of the book (practical time/life management) was really refreshing reading for me. Yes, it is basically combination of Covey, GTD and old tricks, but in innovative ways with new ideas. I especially appreciate personal notes and author`s experiences about using above-mentioned systems + what he lacked/changed. <br><br>Altogether, interesting reading I recommend.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for sharing.  I have been thinking about ways to bring my Puritan theology to bear on time management and productivity, and this appears to be at least a step in the right direction, as this person works for Desiring God, which is influenced by Puritanism to some degree.</div>

<div class="content">Austin, I think this book could be helpful in that concern. It also includes further readings on the subject (you can download first chapter+content from author website)</div>

<div class="content">I just ordered a sample of this book. I heard him on Beyond the To-Do List. Glad it's worthwhile.</div>

<div class="content">Zipping through the theology. I'm curious to see how he blends 7 Habits/GTD. How's everyone else doing with this book/system?</div>

<div class="content">avrum, I think the book is only several days old, so we will need some time to test. I am definitely going to try the system and I will report here later.</div>

<div class="content">Christian and Jewish theology are quite different. At times, radically so. So many of Perman's suggestions and exercises are not applicable to my world view. However, this book reignited an old idea - mainly, to create a productivity/goal based system informed by Jewish though i.e. Chassidic, Mussar, Midrash, etc. I shared this idea with a rabbi/acquaintance, and he expressed interest. Ideas are already flowing back and forth. I have no doubt Mark's ideas will permeate many of our discussions.</div>

<div class="content">avrum:<br><br>That would be really interesting. I hope you'll share the results with us.</div>

<div class="content">Finished the book. I'm left feeling underwhelmed. Mark really has set the bar quite high vis-a-vis new approaches to task/project/life management. <br><br>From Dreams to DWM, he really does cover the gamut in this genre.<br><br>Everything else seems worn and tired.</div>

<div class="content">Avrum, just out of curiosity, can you share the principles that would guide a Jewish approach to productivity (that depart from Christianity)? I am very interested.</div>

<div class="content">Melanie - <br><br>There are A LOT of principles to choose from. If this idea gets off the ground, I'll share them.  The seedlings for this idea came from a documentary about the Hassidim, particularly this short clip: <br><br>Watch from 10:20 (appx 10 secs): <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCUBXRbDg08" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCUBXRbDg08</a><br>Watch from 0:00 - 1:15 (appx 1 min): <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL8t7FeEP6k" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL8t7FeEP6k</a><br><br>And my own inner work during the Hebrew months of Elul (August–September) and Tishri (September-October). During this time, there are rituals and holidays, ie. Rosh Hoshana - Jewish New Year, designed to prod Jews to better themselves, and prepare for the holiday of Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement). Handled well, these six weeks hold tremendous potential for goal setting, self-growth, etc. <br><br>Unfortunately, for many people, the learning/growth ends after Yom Kippur. My goal is to extend this process into the rest of the year. For example:  <br><br>Winter: Hannukah: Darkness, doubt, etc. How to bring light into your plans after the dip of enthusiasm post-goals/tishrei<br><br>Spring: Passover: Liberation, etc. Working on one's habits, things that hold us back <br><br>I get giddy just pondering the potential of melding Family Systems theory, Barbara Sher & Mark Forster with with traditional Jewish sources i.e Mussar and Chassidic. <br><br>Praying I find someone in my community who feels the same.</div>

<div class="content">I appreciated finding Matt's blog a long time ago. I think he excels in the Why and getting Christians motivated to act and apply their faith to life. I never considered the implementation techniques nearly as valuable as his push for the right focus.</div>
