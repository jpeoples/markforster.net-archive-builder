<div class="content">It started with a missed deadline. Then another. Then a pile of laundry so high it qualified for mountain status. Jamie knew something had to change. So, one Tuesday afternoon (after three hours of scrolling cat memes and reorganizing their spice rack alphabetically), they took the boldest step yet: they walked into their first meeting of Procrastinators Anonymous.<br>“Hi Jamie,” the group echoed warmly, half of them still clutching half-written to-do lists and unopened planners.<br>Jamie cleared their throat. “I was going to come last week, but I got distracted by a documentary on the migratory habits of sea cucumbers.”<br>Nods of understanding rippled through the room.<br>The Twelve Steps (Eventually)<br>The group’s motto? “Why do today what you can reschedule for tomorrow?” But beneath the chuckles and calendar chaos, there was real camaraderie. Members shared stories of heroic last-minute tax filings, epic email drafts that never saw the light of day, and the universal truth that productivity apps are just digital guilt machines.<br>Each week, they tackled one of the Twelve Steps—though sometimes it took three weeks to get through Step One. Progress, not perfection.<br>Tools of the Trade<br>Jamie learned the sacred rituals:<br>•	The Pomodoro Technique (aka “tomato timer magic”)<br>•	The 2-Minute Rule (if it takes less time than making a cup of tea, just do it)<br>•	Accountability Buddies (aka “nagging with love”)<br>They even started a “Procrastination Journal,” which ironically became the most consistent habit they’d ever kept.<br>A New Dawn (Eventually)<br>Months passed. Jamie didn’t become a productivity guru overnight. But they did start finishing things. Slowly. Joyfully. With fewer sea cucumber documentaries.<br>And every time they felt the pull of the procrastination vortex, they remembered the group’s unofficial mantra: “Done is better than perfect. Unless it’s a soufflé.”</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jamie from a fellow Procrastinator, can you share more about the “Procrastination Journal" practice?</div>
