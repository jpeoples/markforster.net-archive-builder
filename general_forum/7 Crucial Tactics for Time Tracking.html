<div class="content">To me, any of Mark's systems or other low level time management systems are essentially time management plans. :-)</div>

<div class="content">I disagree with the use of "plan" here.  A plan defines what *will* be accomplished and *when*.  Mark's systems lay out a collection of things that *may* be accomplished at *some* indeterminate time.  Very different.</div>

<div class="content">Alan:<br><br>Sorry, i guess what I was getting at wasn't clear. There's what is in a MF system, and what that MF system represents. A MF system is an algorithmic plan of how you will solve the question of what to do at any point during discretionary time. The system is the plan that will be executed, the "when" is during discretionary time. The stuff inside the system, I agree, constitutes not a plan, but the possibilities or fuel for the system to execute, and what comes out of that is not always obvious or predictable from the outset, but the plan of execution to resolve that nebulous possibility into action is clear enough beforehand, I think.<br><br>Indeed, having that plan of execution and having confidence is pretty important, because otherwise we will lose trust in the list and increase our anxiousness/fear, thus becoming ineffective.
