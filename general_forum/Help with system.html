<div class="content">Hi all,<br><br>My name is Brett and I’ve been viewing the site for a while.  I'm really struggling to get a good system going and I'm now going on 10 months with constant flip flopping and it's driving me crazy.  I used GTD before that for several years but my new job is too fast paced to make GTD work for me.  Here are some details:<br><br>1.  I travel about 90% of the work week. The system I need must be portable.<br>2.  I have a smartphone, tablet, and laptop, so technology is not an issue.  However, I like using paper and pen/pencil.<br>3.I work as an investigator for workplace harassment and employee relations issues. My work consists mostly of small projects:<br>a.  Example:  bob states that suzie touched him inappropriately.  I will investigate via phone, email, in person, etc and then rule on the validity of the claim.<br>b.  My notes must be collected to write a report for legal purposes.<br>c.  I have to have them in a format that I can reference if further issues arise.  <br>4. A typical day is spent traveling, doing interviews, sitting in a location making phone calls, etc.  I average around 30-40 calls a day that are new issues to be dealt with, people returning calls, etc.  So on top of existing issues, I have 10-15 new ones per day.  The average case lasts 4 days to resolve.<br><br>I've been having 1 loose leaf page for each project and doing project planning there.  I will write notes, next actions to be taken, etc on the project planning page.  But the difficulty with this is that when I'm on the run and have a short period of time to work on items, I have to leaf through all of those pages (sometimes 40-50 at a time) to find tasks that need done.  This makes it difficult to be productive in the short snatches of time I have.<br><br>On the other hand, if I decide to transpose project tasks to one central list, then i have to go back to the project pages to update them.  There's always the chance that the items from project pages don't make it to the central task list, and vice versa.<br><br>I've tried evernote, all manner of GTD apps, paper in many iterations and I'm just not finding the groove I need.  When I use electronic lists, it ALWAYS becomes very cumbersome/more complicated than I want and when I use paper there's always the need to transfer, rewrite to the project pages, and then there's the fear I'll lose my paper.<br><br>If anyone has a similar job or has any ideas I'd really love to hear them.  I'm in this whirlwind and it's making it difficult to be productive.<br><br>Thanks for listening.<br><br>Brett</div>

<div class="content">Keep those project sheets exactly as you have them with all info and all questions to be addressed. From each active project, put its title in an AF list. If the title isn't enough, add a detail of something you need to do for it. It shouldn't be necessary to put all tasks if all projects into AF; just one or two from each.</div>

<div class="content">Sounds like one of the key issues is the sheer volume of tasks that you have, and for this I would recommend good old fashioned superfocus with at least 30 lines per page (a second column will handle the emergencies.)  I don't think there is anything else at the moment that will help you get through those tasks quickly and efficiently (i.e. doing the right tasks at the right time).  Anything else, as you mentioned, would probably bog down pretty quickly.  <br><br>I had a similar job for a year a s mediator when I had a large case load and lots of deadlines and legal reporting.  At the time there was only DIT and AF1, and I must say AF1 worked beautifully.  What started to happen was the list of uncompleted tasks got shorter and shorter.  I was spending more time "doing" and less time maintaining the system. <br><br>At a different level,  make sure you take good care of yourself.  You may have too much to do, and at the end of the day, is it really worth it? Just saying.    <br><br>Hope this helps.</div>

<div class="content">thanks guys.  both are good suggestions and will probably be the only way to go.<br><br>Paul, I'm curious how you dealt with the issue of recording completed items in your projects.  I'd be interested in your workflow if you're willing to share.  and your concern is greatly appreciated.<br><br>Alan, thanks a bunch.  I never thought of that way of handling projects.<br><br>bottom line, I have to get a handle on this.  I'm tired of working 20 hours a day and constntly changing systems.  I feel I keep starting over and with no progress.<br><br>thanks<br>Brett</div>

<div class="content">Brett:<br><br>Good advice from Alan and Paul.<br><br>Just a few additional points:<br><br>1) When using paper and pen, the simplest method for marking up tasks is to use flags. The Post-It index flags are small, bright, come in several colours, and are removable and re-usable. If you use a slightly larger flag you can write on the flag as well.<br><br>2) In a situation where you are handling a large number of small projects, system is everything. Look at every aspect of how you handle your cases and identify the blocks and sticking places. Then work out ways of removing those blocks. For instance you are probably already using standard forms for keeping case notes, but if you are not then they will save a considerable amount of time. Are you scheduling follow-up calls and case reviews? That can save you a lot of bother. These are just examples - there are probably hundreds of ways in which you can make your operation more efficient if you examine every detail carefully.<br><br>3) Do you have colleagues? By which I mean people in the same line of business whom you know and can ask advice from? Is there one of them who has a reputation for being super well-organized? If so, ask his/her advice about how they do it.<br><br>4) Bear in mind that this is primarily an organizational problem, rather than a time-management one. It's not so much what you do as how you do it. <br><br>5) And finally, a bit of reverse psychology sometimes works. Imagine you had to give a half-hour presentation to people in the same line of business as yourself entitled "How to be as disorganized as I am". What would your advice be?</div>

<div class="content">Brett,<br><br>have you tried to use templates, on paper or electronically?<br>Maybe some kind of spreadsheet (MS Excel) or simple database (MS Access) could help you collect your data, record follow-up tasks and print your reports. Or even a simple table (e.g. in MS Word) might be of help.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Brett. I'm not as organised as I would like to be, but looking in from the outside here are my thoughts on at least part of what you can do:<br><br>1. Continue to use one sheet per project, but file them in a way that makes sense. So you could  file them alphabetically in a ring binder with a-z indexes to make finding them easier.<br>2. You could keep a sheet which just lists the 'current' projects so you can glance at it to find the sheet you want.<br>3. Mark's idea of creating forms and schedules is great - I'm planning on doing the same for one area of my own business. It's good to have familiar forms and also some sort of process chart or checklist that helps you to know all the tasks you have to perform for each project.<br>4. Use your list to just bring forward project names or tasks.<br><br>I'm looking forward to reading any further ideas anyone has for this problem - my work is different to yours, but I also deal with multiple small projects.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Brettypooh<br>I don't travel a lot for the moment but if I would I think I would insist on portability. <br>For project, even If I am convinced that paper folders are the best but HERE, it is inappropriate. You could not handle a hundred of them any where. The best would be to use a digital solution on the tool you use the most. May be EVERNOTE, may be ONE NOTE, May be a word sheet whatever. <br>For acting you could use an AF list or a SF list on paper. Or even a paper folder with list like Seraphim does. I am trying the system and I admit than it is gorgeous ! I always thought that a todo daily list was a mistake I was wrong. It works for me. The question is about calls if you have many like me the best is to use a special list or an iPhone list or an iPad list to be able to call from anywhere.<br>Make it simple. This is indeed my conviction. Systems can be complicated if situation are complicated but you must be able to use it at a glance. <br>All systems are collecting tools. The difference is how you use the system and for what. <br>The purpose number one must absolutely be EASY ACTION. <br>Don't try to collect all in one place if it doesn't work. The best is to separate action from projects cause projects are for thinking i.e. taking altitude and action is for acting i.e. stubble and do. Hope that's help.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Brett,<br><br>I support Jupiter with his last paragraph - from my experience with similar type of projects, it is best to have project files/lists (with notes, ides, phases, actions) apart from action lists. How I see it, it is another mode to think project-wise (review project, organizing, planning it, checking important steps) and to be in "do" mode, just doing things which needs to be done. I am most efficient, when I deliberately and explicitly switch between these two modes during the day. Also, remember it is not necessary to have one inflexible, fixed system for ever - my approach changes as activities or type of work change. Sometimes I have only one to-do list and calendar, sometimes I switch to autofocus or daily plans, sometimes when under many projects I use various ad-hoc lists (calls, with person X, in city Y, must do today, project list, difficult/important etc.).</div>

<div class="content">Hi Brett,<br><br>I also work as an investigator and am out of the office 90% of the time. Though not the same job, there are some similarities with my job. <br><br>1. My work consists of small projects. The time for me to write up a report for a case is 2 to 30 hours. <br>2. I have legal time-lines to follow. Ten days to write a report, 10 days for facility to respond and depending on the severity of the deficiencies found 30, 60 or 360 days to prove compliance. For some facilities I have to do an onsite visit at 45 days.<br>3. I do not have as many phone calls as you. I found phone calls very unproductive. I have tried to make systems to decrease phone calls and to use email instead. When I am out of the office my phone message says I am out and will return calls the next week ...for faster response please email me at.... or call my admin at….This has cut down the number of calls tremendously. <br><br>4. I try to delegate as much as I can to my administrative assistant. I have created checklists for her so that she can do some of the more tedious tasks. <br><br>5. I have actually tried to slow down the system by requiring facility responses by fax or mail. When I allow email, I have to reject many responses due to lack of signature. In addition, I would get facilities that would email, fax and mail their responses which made more work for me.<br><br>My system<br>This is what I have done. It is not perfect, but is working for me.<br><br>1. I take all notes with a lifescribe pen. This way I have paper notes and electronic backup if I loose my notebook.<br><br>2. I use Google spreadsheet to keep track of all my current cases. Instead of a sheet for each case I use one line per case, with the different project steps as a separate column. I like Google spreadsheet because I can access it anywhere.<br>I am not a programmer, but was able to set-up the spreadsheet to count down the number of days a facility had to respond. I do not fill in every column (project step) on the spreadsheet for each case. It is not necessary.<br><br>3. I use DWM2 for working my list with the addition of a rule for start each day with a current initiative. I do not try to put each phone call or email in the list. I just have an entry process VM, process in box, Follow-up and those types of things.<br><br>4. At the start of a day, I review my list and select a current initiative. I use an X-47 diary that I purchased from Germany. I use 2 lined booklets one for home and one for work. I only write the DWM2 list on the right page. I use the left for notes, ideas and such.  I also have a timecircle calendar with 1 week on two pages. I use this for my appointments, mileage notes, etc. I like the clock face because it gives me a better perspective on my day and how much free time I really have. <br><br>5. As Mark has said systems are very important. I am constantly working on checklists, systems, prewritten letters so that someone else can take care of the tasks. (Ala 4Hour work week)<br>One of my weekly projects is find a better way to handle one part of a project. Doing this I have been able to implement new systems that has saved me so far about 30-45 minutes per project. In addition, in a journal I write answers to the questions what was better about today, what I could have done differently?<br><br>6. I try to make a game out of finishing my projects as I have a tendency of being a perfectionist and spending too much time writing reports. When I cross off a tasks as completed or worked on, I put the day number in front of the task. I then use this number to calculate the number of days work left in the system  ( number unactioned tasks/ actioned tasks= number days work).<br><br>6. I have also created an end time to my day and refuse to work on weekends. This forces me to work smarter.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jennifer,<br><br>I'm curious how you handle keeping notes on your cases.  Do you use google docs or just do all case notes on livescribe?<br><br>I know that I'll assign a task to someone, which makes a call turn into a waiting for.  Do you do any notations in your google docs list at that point?<br><br>If you could talk a little about your workflow handling individual tasks, delegations, etc that would be great.<br><br>Thanks again,<br><br>brett</div>

<div class="content">Brett,<br><br>For notes on my cases I use Lifescribe or enter them directly into proprietary software I am required to use.<br><br>For Tasks I assign:<br>•	If they are to my admin, I attach a checklist of what needs to be done and she puts the completed checklist in my inbox when she is done. <br>•	For facilities, I track in Google docs. <br><br><br>My typical workflow.<br><br>I use DWM1 for my task list. I start each day with a current initiative. <br><br>If I have completed an investigation and need to write the report, that becomes my current initiative. If the report looks like it would take more than 3 hours to write, I brainstorm and write an outline. I work no longer than 3 hours on a report the first day. If I am unable to finish a report it becomes the next day’s current initiative. I will work on the report no more than 5 hours (split between 2 sittings in the day)<br><br>I don’t put delegated tasks in my task list until it pops up as due in my Google spreadsheet.<br><br>I write only the project name in the task list, not each step of what needs to be done. If I don’t complete the investigation write-up in one go I will re-enter the task with the next step required. (Per DWM1 rules)<br><br>Hope this helps,<br><br>Jennifer</div>
