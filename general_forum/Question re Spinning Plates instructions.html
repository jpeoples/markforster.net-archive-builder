<div class="content">### I am confused on when to take action when making a pass through the list. ###<br><br>The Spinning Plates method is described here:<br><br><a href="../blog/The Spinning Plates Method of Project Control (Experimental).html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2014/3/30/the-spinning-plates-method-of-project-control-experimental.html</a><br><br>It features two images, the first comes with the caption: Phase 1 - Build-Up<br><br>I think I don't interpret this image correctly.<br><br>The way I understand it (wrongly?) is that the first task you took action on is "Tidy Office"?<br><br>Then you marked it with an arrow because you had to do something on it, correct?<br><br>So, you started writing the list "Comments & Blogs", checked and saw: nothing to do here. So you marked it off with a check mark symbol. The same for Email.<br><br>Then you saw: only check marks, I can add another task. So you added "Wash Up". You went back to see for "Comments & Blogs" but nothing to do here, so you marked it of with a checkmark. Then you checked email, nothing to do here, so again: check mark. Then you went to do the Wash Up and saw: nothing to do here, check mark.<br><br>Then you saw that you could add another task and added "Blogs".<br><br>And so on.<br><br>And the first task where you had to work on it to get it up to date was Tidy Office, hence the arrow.<br><br>Then you went for a Walk, then you did "comments & blogs", then gardening, the again "comments & blogs".<br><br>But you did for example no work at all for the task "Email", right? Or wrong?<br><br>I got the feeling I don't get the mechanics of how to make the pass through the list.<br><br><br>If anybody could help me, that would make me very happy!</div>

<div class="content">Christopher:<br><br>You need to read the instructions. The picture is there only to illustrate the instructions.<br><br><< The way I understand it (wrongly?) is that the first task you took action on is "Tidy Office"? >><br><br>No, you have completely misunderstood it. The first task I took action on was "Comments and Blog Posts". When I'd finished working on it I put a tick in the first column to show that I'd done everything that needed doing.<br><br>The second task I took action on was Email. I did everything that needed to be done and put a tick in the first column.<br><br>I then did "Comments and Blog Posts" and "Email" again and added "Wash Up". I finished everything that needed doing on all of them, so they all got a tick in the second column. <br><br>Read the instructions again and try it out. You will only understand it if you actually try it. Then read the instructions again. If you still can't work out what it means come back and ask again.</div>

<div class="content">I did ask my question only after I read the instructions several times and also tried the system in the last few days.<br><br>So, when I go trough the list and work on a task until it is up-to-date I mark it with a check mark, okay. <br><br>But what does it mean then to mark it with an arrow?<br><br>"If there is work in progress" I thought, if there is work, I have to do it when I arrive at the task?<br><br>This is how I understand going through the list now:<br><br>1. arrive at task<br>2. do any outstanding work on it (if there is work)<br>3. mark it of as up-to-date with check mark<br>4. proceed to next task<br><br>How is there room for an eventuality in which case I would mark the task with an arrow?<br><br>Sorry for my apparent boneheadedness, but I don't get it.</div>

<div class="content">Christopher:<br><br>1. arrive at task<br>2. do some outstanding work on it (if there is work)<br>3. mark it as still having work in progress with arrow<br>4. proceed to next task</div>

<div class="content">Mark thank you for your answer.<br><br>What you describe is what I did so far.<br><br>You wrote this:<br><br>>><br>1. arrive at task<br>2. do some outstanding work on it (if there is work)<br>3. mark it as still having work in progress with arrow<br>4. proceed to next task<br><<<br><br>But you also wrote this:<br><br>>> <br>No, you have completely misunderstood it. The first task I took action on was "Comments and Blog Posts". When I'd finished working on it I put a tick in the first column to show that I'd done everything that needed doing.<br><<<br><br>In my mind this is a contradiction. (This is the point I don't understand.)<br><br>How do I tick off the task with an check mark in one case but with an arrow in the other case, when I did do some work on it in both cases?<br><br>I don't get it. Sorry. I hate myself already for being such a drag, but I truly don't get it.</div>

<div class="content">Christopher:<br><br>The difference is that if you work on a task and finish all outstanding action on it, then you mark it with a tick.<br><br>If you work on a task, and don't finish all outstanding action on it, then you mark it with an arrow.<br><br>So if I have a task "Email" and I successfully clear all the email, I mark the task with a tick.<br><br>But if there is a lot of email and I decide to leave some of it for later, I mark the task with an arrow.<br><br>The point of this is that while I have one or more tasks marked with an arrow I can't add any more tasks to the list.</div>

<div class="content">Mark Forster:<br><br>Now I got it!<br><br>Thank you for helping me out!<br><br>Much appreciated.<br><br><br>Now I also understand better why someone felt likened Spinning Plates to the system in GED.</div>
