<div class="content">I was looking back over some of Mark's older postings. These ideas stood out for me:<br><br>1. A lot of the most positive changes in oneself come from unexpected, uncontrollable and sometimes unwanted events<br><br>2. We can never be certain what steps will lead us to a goal. A path we wish were straight can be very zig-zag.We can only join the dots when we look back.<br><br>3. Satisfaction, ease, and balanced living can be eroded by making "successful" achievement of goals too important, giving it too much attention, making it stand out too far. Blotting out a beautiful view. Goal achievement is not the same as success and satisfaction; they may not be closely related. We can become too attached to all the success/achieve/goals gurus.</div>
