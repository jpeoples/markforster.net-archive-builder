<div class="content">Wondering if anyone has had a look at this - <br><a href="http://amazon.com/Time-Block-Planner-Daily-Method-Distracted/dp/0593192052" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://amazon.com/Time-Block-Planner-Daily-Method-Distracted/dp/0593192052</a><br><br>The Amazon "Look Inside" feature includes most of the pages of the intro material and a preview of the format of the time blocking pages.<br><br>The method he proposes for making adjustments through the day seems fairly reasonable and low-overhead (pp. 9-10), and I like how it could be used as a diagnostic tool. But I still doubt whether I could consistently use the method. Also, I use my Outlook calendar all through the day -- I imagine it could be troublesome to keep my Outlook meeting schedule in sync with this paper notebook.<br><br>Some of the "tips" seem reasonable, such as << The goal of time blocking is not to stick to your original schedule no matter what. It's instead to try to always have an intentional plan for what to do with your time. If circumstances upend your schedule... simply fix the schedule for the time that remains in the day so that you remain intentional about where you direct your focus. >><br><br>None of this is new, especially for readers of Mark's books and blog. And some of the material could almost be pulled straight from DIT or GED, such as the section on "The Shutdown Ritual". But Cal doesn't claim that it's new -- on page 2, he explains how it's simply his own approach to a very old practice that goes back to Benjamin Franklin or earlier.<br><br>Personally, I've picked up several useful nuggets from Cal Newport's books but have never had much luck with time blocking methods. <br><br>Any thoughts?</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br>Personally I've never been able to make time-blocking work - which is no doubt why I'm not a multi-billionaire ruling the world from my secret bunker.<br><br>The problem with methods used by top business people is that they have by-and-large a lot of structure in place already. I'm referring to myriad personal assistants, doorkeepers, enablers and so forth. That makes it much easier to keep one's blocks stable.<br><br>That is why I'm not that interested in the methods they use now that they are rich. What would really interest me is the methods they used when they were still penniless, unknown and lackey-less. In other words the methods which got them from there to here.<br></div>

<div class="content"><<...the methods they use now that they are rich.>><br><br>Mark:<br><br>Similar sentiment to yours, but not related to success. Cal is a computer science professor at Georgetown University. According to Cal, he was always uber-motivated. He wrote bestselling books about studying in his early 20s, while completing his computer science degrees, etc. <br><br>So... is it the method or is it the man (woman)? <br><br>I'd imagine Newport was primed and pumped - from an early age - to forecast his work (time blocks) and stay true to his commitments.  Most experts deny that their upbringing/background has much to do with their tools and success (the one exception is Laura Vanderkam (author of 168 Hours) who owns her proclivities towards organization and efficiency from a young age). <br><br>Similar to you Mark, I've been unable to make time blocking work. Somehow, I've written three books, run a full private practice and raise 3 boys w/ my wife. <br><br>Full disclosure: I continue to use your Scatter Map idea, and find it very useful. A nice combination of Julia Cameron's "Morning Pages"  and Allen's brain dumping idea.</div>

<div class="content">I have found Cal’s time blocking approach to be essential at getting important things done. Without using time blocking, Without it, I find that I drift too much towards his so-called shallow tasks, instead of the projects that really move the needle for my primary job responsibilities. And (as noted by Seraphim), Cal is upfront with the fact that things can blow up one’s schedule, and his response is pragmatic - this will happen on occasion, so try as soon as possible to adjust the remaining time blocks as necessary. I typically update my time blocks at least once per day, and I find it to be a useful exercise at regaining a sense of control of and intentionality in what I plan to get done.<br><br>I do schedule blocks of time (try to do 1h per day) to apply one of Mark’s systems to keep other projects/tasks afloat. So far, I have found it to be a nice merger of time management approaches - Cal’s Deep Work and Mark’s Little-and-Often.<br><br>BTW, Cal’s podcast is good - he goes through a lot of practical examples in response to inquiries from his audience.</div>

<div class="content">avrum and Bernard:<br><br>I don't have any problem with the idea that time blocking works for some people - particularly people who are highly self-motivated in the first place. But is it a suitable method for the average person who is naturally lazy and undisciplined? Being naturally lazy and undisciplined myself, I have always tried to to develop methods which work for people like me. And what I've found is that the best methods have minimal structure which respond better to the variable energy states throughout the day.<br><br>However for those who want more structure the best time blocking method I've found is the "school timetable" which I've described in various places, such as <a href="../blog/Working from Home.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2020/3/25/working-from-home.html</a></div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the response, Mark. You and many others here have been amazingly productive with personalized systems and yet are continuously seeking to experiment and improve systems. This is the heart of the design process cycle - design-build-test-design-build-test-etc, which resonates well with me as an engineering professor. I love reading about the experiences that you and everyone else have, and the iterative improvements each of you make.<br><br>Count me among the lazy and undisciplined - this is why I find that I do need to time block, to try to overcome these characteristics I share with at least a few of you. I just am trying to be intentional with the times of the day during which I allow myself to focus on one project versus cycle through a list. Not too different from DIT Current Initiative+daily task list (which I have always loved in concept but could never execute well due to a lack of discipline onto regularly say no to candidate tasks/projects).<br><br>One thing that has been most helpful for me is to protect time in my calendar, regardless of TM system - for every minute of meetings that I have scheduled (either I schedule it or someone else does), I add a minute of time that I dedicate to being unavailable to meet. It fills up my calendar very quickly, but in a great way!</div>

<div class="content">I preorded it, watched the preorder video and studied the instructions in the amazon sample pages.<br><br>I am trying to make time blocking work alongside a bouncy long list. Not here yet, but will keep everyone posted...</div>

<div class="content">These "appointments with self" which Newport amongst many others are proposing, are fundamentally different from appointments with other people. In order to re-negotiate them, you do not have to deal with another person first. You can just alter them on a whim.<br><br>They are therefore just a task list.<br><br>Pre-scheduling in such a manner can increase focus, because you know _when_ something is going to get done and you do not have to consider doing that task now.<br><br>It can also help combating resistance, because you now when you scheduled the task to do, hence your inner man can start working on easing into it.<br><br>What happens when you don't show up, though?<br><br>You better have a good excuse, because you are setting precedent here for what such an appointment with self is worth.<br><br>But you may not show up because of resistance to the scheduled task.<br><br>The higher the aversion, the higher the chance scheduling like that won't work.<br><br>Why then, would one think that scheduling is the solution front and foremost for high resistance tasks?</div>

<div class="content"><< What happens when you don't show up, though?>><br><br>Christopher:<br><br>Nothing, niscsht, rien, nada.<br><br>As a therapist, if I don't show up for my client's appointment, they will be very upset. If I do this enough, they will leave my practice, and won't refer friends/family to me. That's a consequence with teeth - enough to make me show up on time, every time. <br><br>On the other hand, if I schedule "Go to Gym" at 3pm next Thursday, and I don't go... what happens?  Nothing, niscsht, rien, nada.<br><br>Some people might assume that my broken commitment to myself is a huge loss, a domino effect that will taint all future decisions. I have not found that to be the case. <br><br>I'm not suggesting time blocking can't work for some people. But I think there's a certain personality that jives with this type of planning. <br><br>Once I'm done with my REAL commitments - client appt, dr appt, pick up kids from school - I want the freedom to pick/choose what to work on next.</div>

<div class="content">> I don't go... what happens? Nothing, niscsht, rien, nada.<br><br>This is your choice.  There are other choices: <br><br>Deducting a point from your brownie reward score; taking time out to analyze what kept you from your self appointment (circumstance or mental) and think what might improve next time; saying to yourself, "you're such a poo-poo head for not keeping this simple appointment"; saying to yourself, "you are not this kind of person; you are a gym-goer"; calling your accountability friend and saying "I missed my gym appointment".<br><br>Or your choice, which is to not have self-appointments.</div>

<div class="content"><< This is your choice. There are other choices>><br><br>Alan - the question posed was: What happens when you don't show up, though?<br><br>So you're correct that it IS possible to use the missed self-appointment as an opportunity for self-knowledge, etc. My point was that it is not realistic, and that Newport's success has more to do with upbringing/disposition than technique. <br><br>I'm a practical man. I could care less about the honeymoon phase** of any self-management system. What I'm very interested in is 6+ months later... were you able to sustain the practice? Does the system (GTD, AF, Weekly Planning) continue to bear fruit for you? <br><br>** Therapy is the same. Most people enter full of piss and vinegar (and pain) for change. By session 4, a sobering reality settles in that this takes A LOT of work.</div>

<div class="content">@avrum,<br><br>From your professional experience/research, do you have citations for it being a personality trait and not something that is trainable?<br><br>Based on my experience of 40+ years not holding myself accountable in similar ways I let others hold me accountable, I am trying to stick to time-blocking, to build up the "muscles" needed to do so. I feel like I am making slow, but steady, progress.<br><br>Cal Newport certainly believes anyone can build this up, and he gives tips for doing so. But is it an eternal personality trait, and not something that can be taught and strengthened? Or is it like a skill, say learning an instrument, where after X,000 number of hours I can certainly demonstrate improvement even if I was not born a prodigy. I may not become Oscar Peterson, but I can play the piano well enough to perform publicly...<br><br>I don't know the answers, but I am staking some attention time that I can learthis,is and it can help me become more self-accountable, though maybe not as much as someone born with this trait. <br><br>What do you think?</div>

<div class="content">@vegheadjones<br><br><<From your professional experience/research>> <br><br>My specialty is family and marriage therapy. Specifically, anxiety related to commitment. However, many clients want to address procrastination issues during their session. My thoughts on productivity are based on clinical observation, and my own self-experimentation. <br><br><<personality trait and not something that is trainable>><br><br>If by "trainable" you mean: Can people change? Yes. But sustained change is much harder than self-help authors suggest. Hence, someone who purchases Newport's book (or implements time blocking on their own) or any other system, will almost always report great results for a week, maybe 4. I'm not interested in honeymoon phase radical change. My question... and it is the same question I hold myself to is: Were you able to sustain the change for at least 6 months. If so, what metrics are you using to gauge the success of your efforts? <br><br>Example: I have successfully used GTD for 7 months. In that time, I have started a book proposal, found an agent, and have written x number of pages a day. I feel calmer after my weekly reviews, and my family has suggested I'm more present at home. <br><br><<I feel like I am making slow, but steady, progress.>><br><br>Which is great! <br><br>Like Mark, I have not been able to make it work for me. I tried time blocking - on/off 0 in 2002 when I first read 7 Habits. <br><br>My umbrage with Newport isn't the idea itself. It's the semi-religious fervour he brings to his prescriptive solutions i.e. If you don't do it my way, you will not be very successful in life. He doesn't say this specifically, but it's implied. Allen and Covey imply very similar messages. <br><br>A couple of years ago, my wife had a few of her friends (all doctors, as is my wife) over for dinner. I was curious how all these high performers made it through medical school, residency and now work as physicians, some raising children at the same time. None of them had any identifiable productivity system in place. And they're all doing just fine. Side note: My wife uses physical paper stickies all over her monitor. She keeps 0 goals, but totally throws herself into whatever project tickles her fancy... and is almost always successful. This is due to her upbringing... her parents were like this, and her siblings more/less are very similar. <br><br>I also know quite a few productivity nerds - granted, mostly online - and to my eye/ears, their greatest accomplishments seem to be reading/implementing new productivity systems. Of course, there's nothing wrong with that (David Allen has quipped... there are worse ways to spend one's time).</div>

If you don't, you will continue to fail in the same way.<br><br>As it happens, I am doing time blocking, have for just over a year, with growing success.  And had not done for 25 years prior.  I attribute current success to regular self-assessment, not to setting time blocks.  If your answer to "what happens when you don't show up" is "Nada", then of course it won't work.  <br><br>Now suppose you implement time blocks, and you review regularly how that's going, and in your review you conclude "miserably".  In that case, absolutely time blocking isn't for you (or you have the wrong allocations).  And maybe you know before you even start.  I thought I knew, but the past year changed my mind.<br><br>But my main point is still: You must evaluate and adapt.  Nada means failure.</div>

<div class="content">Hi,<br><br>I started trying something I am calling "FV time blocking" and thought I share out:<br><br>At the start of the day, I go through my long list doing "no question FV." When I get to the end of the list I look at the selected tasks and start to group them together, by project, context or whatever makes sense. I then put the grouping on my time block planner, estimating how much time I will spend on each grouping. If I have too little time, I need to take things off my FV list. If I have unscheduled time left over I get to add to the list. <br><br>At the end of the day, I cross off what was done, reset the list and begin anew the next day.<br><br>My goal is to capture the best of FV and time blocking. It's only been a few days (sorry @avrum 😊) but so far so good. <br><br>PS I am using an electronic list to make the groupiong and ungrouping easier.</div>
