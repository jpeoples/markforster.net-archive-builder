<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">While looking through the bargain book site, I saw a productivity book titled "10-10-10". From the blurb: "In fact, when you're facing a dilemma, all it takes to begin are three questions: What are the consequences of my decision in 10 minutes? In 10 months? And in 10 years?"<br><br>Sounds like a good set of questions to ask when choosing which of the tasks on the current page (of any system) will get attention now, and when you dismiss (delay) tasks, and when you decide to scrap them.<br><br>I think this would support the Future Reality in Dreams. If I choose this now, will it make my preferred Future Reality more or less likely? Will it make a different future more likely?<br><br>I can see the answers compounding. The consequence in 10 minutes is minor: an extra donut won't matter. However, avoiding (or eating) that donut reinforces a habit (good or bad), and over 10 months that habit will make a difference, and in 10 years you'll certainly know the difference.<br><br>It can also take away pressure, much like Mark's idea of putting "buy red folders" and "buy blue folders" on the list. I used to agonize over ordering in restaurants. In 10 minutes, I'll enjoy whatever is in front of me. In 10 months it won't matter -- unless, of course, it's the aforementioned donut.<br><br>I'm going to start asking those questions when choosing from my AF list, and even when choosing whether to pick up a good book or the list.</div>
