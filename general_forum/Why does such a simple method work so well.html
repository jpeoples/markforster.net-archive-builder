<div class="content">Hi all!<br><br>I think I've tried (to some extent) most of the time management methods on this forum.  I've had decent success with them, some more than others.  Yet I recently went through a disruption in my life and set aside following a system.  Upon getting my feet planted on the ground again, I began using the "Must - Could - Should" list.  This was mainly just so I could have a central place to keep my priorities and work from.  Thing is... it works great for me!  So, of course I'm starting to wonder how it can be tweaked into a working system and not just merely a priority 'catch-all' list.  Any ideas?</div>

<div class="content">Marco:<br><br>I read a book this summer called "Decide" by Steve McClatchy. The key idea that stood out for me is his prioritization method. He took the classic "ABC" prioritizing method, questioned its effectiveness, and changed it to: <br><br>A: Gain Tasks (Don't "Have-To")<br><br>B: Prevent Pain Tasks (Recorded "Have-To")<br><br>C: Prevent Pain Tasks ("Have-To")<br><br><br>So a list like:<br><br>Mow lawn for wife<br>Laundry<br>Tea<br>Email<br>Buy new phone<br>Breakfast for kids<br>Write 2 pages for screenplay<br>Zip lining?<br>Study russian<br>Pay Visa bill<br><br><br>Becomes:<br><br>A: Gain Tasks<br>Study russian<br>Write 2 pages for screenplay<br>Zip lining?<br>Tea<br><br>B: Prevent Pain (Recorded "Have-To")<br>Pay visa bill<br>Breakfast for kids<br>Mow lawn for wife<br><br>C: Prevent Pain ("Have-To")<br>Buy new phone<br>Laundry<br>Email</div>

<div class="content">Gain Tasks (Results, Progress, Life Improvement, Connecting):<br>Gain tasks move your life in the direction you want it to go. Gain tasks improve your life and make it better. They prevent burnout, ruts and the feeling of being out of balance. They also give you the energy necessary to execute all the prevent pain tasks in less time. <br><br><br>Attributes of Gain Tasks: <br>• Never Urgent <br>• Don’t “Have-To” Do Them <br>• Produce Significant Results or Progress<br>• They Keep You Balanced <br>• You Can’t Delegate Them<br><br><br>Prevent Pain Tasks:<br>Prevent pain tasks only produce significant results when you *don’t* do them. They help you to maintain your life, not make your life better. They maintain the status quo. If neglected, they would eventually be brought to your attention by someone else.<br><br><br>Attributes of Prevent Pain Tasks:<br>• Eventually Become Urgent <br>• “Have-To” Do Them <br>• Keep You Where You Are <br>• They Can Burn You Out <br>• You Can Delegate Them<br><br><br>Two Priority Levels of Prevent Pain Tasks:<br>"B" tasks are recorded by other people<br>“C” tasks will be brought to your attention if you don’t do them, but no one is keeping a written record<br><br><br>So it's:<br><br>A: Gain<br>B: Prevent Pain (Recorded "Have-To") <br>C: Prevent Pain ("Have-To")<br><br>Or:<br><br>A: Improvement<br>B: Maintenance (Recorded)<br>C: Maintenance<br><br>Or:<br><br>A: Leading<br>B: Managing (Recorded)<br>C: Managing</div>

That means that the C's never get done.</div>

<div class="content">michael:<br><br><< A: Gain<br>B: Prevent Pain (Recorded "Have-To")<br>C: Prevent Pain ("Have-To") >><br><br>As far as I can make out from just reading it, this more or less equates to doing the usual method of prioritizing in the order:<br><br>A. Could do<br>B. Must do<br>C. Should do<br><br>Try as hard as I can, I can't see how this could possibly work. If you study Russian and write two pages of your screenplay before giving your kids breakfast, then you are either having to get up extremely early or you have some very annoyed family members!</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br>From what I recall, he suggests doing at least one "A" task per day. The sentiment seemed to be that you really haven't made anything happen unless you have done an "A" task. You have instead only prevented things from happening if you complete all your "B" and "C" tasks. A lot of people rush around doing things to "prevent pain", and yet they are essentially standing in place as far as their life's progress is concerned if they neglect the "A" tasks.</div>

<div class="content">FV basically covers everything from the Gain/Prevent Pain ABC method, and with lower overhead than the system described in the book.<br><br>At some point during the day with FV, one will likely have actioned multiple "gain tasks" that have reached the root position. And the "prevent pain tasks" will have been actioned in order of urgency.</div>

<div class="content">Michael B.<br><br><< From what I recall, he suggests doing at least one "A" task per day. >><br><br>Ah, so it's not actually a prioritization method at all. Calling something Priority A implies that it will be done before lower priorities. Using the wrong terminology is misleading.</div>

<div class="content">Yes. "Must - Should - Could" doesn't function in action as a priority list. For example, I am trying to select 1 item from each section for the day to take some action on. As my list grows I was thinking about selecting 1 "Must", 2 " Should", and 3 "Coulds"</div>

I will be interested to hear how you get on if you decide to try it.<br><br>With this type of grading system you need to watch out for "grade creep" - otherwise everything ends up as an A and you're back to square one. It's usually best to set quotas for A and B, e.g. A's not to be more than 5 per cent of the whole.</div>
