<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">I've been using AF from day 1 (work only!) and am still going strong. I thought I'd make a small check after 2 full months of using the system. So I did some quick counting and came up with the following numbers, for those who like this kind of information ;)<br><br>25 total pages<br>11 first pages closed<br>713 items in total<br>132 open items (i.e. 18.5%)<br>Two thirds of open items (88) in the last five pages<br>An average of 5 open items in the other active pages<br>Only 3 dismissed items<br><br>My global assessment now is that I'm more productive than ever. Procrastination, it not totally eliminated, is strongly reduced. I'm moving forward on lots of subjects in parallel, a lot of which would have been left lying around in the past because less important. The nice thing is that the speed of movement on all these subjects is automagically adjusted depending on current priorities and urgencies.<br><br>Some other more detailed feedback is possible, but the bottom line is: I'm not going to abandon this approach any time soon. Thanks Mark!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Marc,<br>Any plans on using the system for home as well as work?  <br></div>

<div class="content">After 3 more weeks of AF (including 5 days off), the numbers look as follows:<br><br>30 total pages<br>17 pages closed<br>860 items in total<br>142 open items (i.e. 16.5%)<br>An average of 14 open items in pages 21-30<br>Only 7 dismissed items<br><br>Another observation: after the first two months of great productivity, I experienced in the last weeks a kind of slump where I seem to start procrastinating on the whole AF list rather than on particular items. A kind of energy low which I have difficulty to attribute. Either the fact that after more than 2 months of AF the novelty effect I talked about elsewhere seems to be wearing off. Or it's just the impact of some sad event in our family life. Probably some of both...<br><br>Anyway, the way to get out of this slump has been to... open up my list and start working the system again. And somehow I seem to be gradually getting up to speed again and rediscover the magic of AF...</div>

<div class="content">The end of March situation (i.e. 3 full months or 53.5 working days of AF use) looks as follows:<br><br>33 total pages<br>20 first pages closed<br>975 items in total (i.e. a bit more than 18 per working day)<br>8 dismissed items only<br>149 open items<br>818 items checked off (i.e. a bit more than 15 per working day)<br><br>The average number of new items per day (18) is slightly higher than the average number checked off (15). This was also the case after 2 months. I'm not sure yet if I need to worry about this, as it implies that my list will slowly keep growing longer... But the difference is not that large, so maybe it will even out or even reverse after I adjust some more to the system.<br><br>To be continued...</div>

<div class="content">I tracked my AF usage, because I wanted to know more about it. You can have a look at my graph of one month use at <a href="http://www.taskberry.com/2009/05/18/my-autofocus-statistics-autofocus-statisztikam/" rel="nofollow">http://www.taskberry.com/2009/05/18/my-autofocus-statistics-autofocus-statisztikam/</a></div>

<div class="content">Marc,<br><br>If you were checking off the same number of things as you add, what would you ever dismiss?<br><br>If you never dismissed anything, would you really be focussing?<br><br>Just a thought.</div>

<div class="content">Hey Adam, what's up with your spikes and troughs ?  Just curious because I have the same thing going on.</div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline,<br>I noticed the spikes only after I made the chart, it didn't feel spiky in that period of time. Maybe, I disgress one day, then I feel guilty the next day, and I try to catch up. Or it's just a natural rhythm. What do you think about your spikes?</div>

<div class="content">Definitely a rhythym of sorts, but I think mine were more pronounced than yours in my first month or so of AF.  You'd almost think I was bipolar if you looked at some of my early numbers!  It's evened out quite a bit the last month or so.  Because I keep home and work separate, I can definitely see that when I'm really busy at work or working on the weekend, my progress in my home book is much slower due to fatigue.</div>
