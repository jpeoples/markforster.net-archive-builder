<div class="content">In my estimation, SuperFocus does all other systems better.  It lets you take charge, and bend it to your needs.  I will attempt to demonstrate each case:<br><br>Auto Focus 1: Make your task sizes, as you work on them, small, and your work pattern will be exactly that of AF1, entering the next stage of your task on the last page, But you can also add urgent new tasks on the spot, solving AF1's biggest flaw.<br>AF2: With a little tweak, you can process each page by AF2 rules, bottom to top.  Every time you work on something it goes to the bottom.  AF2 broke down because it couldn't get through the list.  Being restricted to one page, that's no longer a problem.  Finish a page, move on, and add your new urgent tasks on the new active page.<br>AF3: See AF2.  Both urgent and old tasks get well covered by this method.<br>AF4: This system works quite well, until your list gets really long as a couple people have observed.  One huge open list and one huge closed list mask the beneficial effect of the closed list.  In SuperFocus, *every page* is an open list and a closed list.  You can effectively do AF4 on every page, though I'm not sure there's a reason to: SAF does things just fine.<br>DWM: This is more tricky because SuperFocus lacks the dated dismissal.  And in many ways DWM already has much of SuperFocus's character.  To get dated task control in SF, you could start a new page every day (or just add a date after the newest task) and dismiss the oldest page after one month.<br>Given that, here are SF's advances:<br>	- Only worry about current and last page, not 3 entry points.<br>	- Keep active tasks on the current page , easier to continue working.<br>	- All the active stuff is clearly separated on the right column.  It's easy to keep these going by working them repeatedly.  This is often better than the weekly focus DWM pushes.<br><br>3T: While it wasn't intended to use the right-side to work on only 3 tasks at a time,  you can do that if you wish.  It fits the rules.  But you aren't restricted to 3.  If something comes up, you can work on it, and get back to your 3.  You can switch modes, charge through a bunch of pages doing small things, and get back to what you were doing before.<br><br>Get Everything Done: Work in repeated bursts of activity, on a variety of tasks.  Good news: With SAF you have a constant supply of varied tasks to apply this method.  I don't know too much about this one so I'll stop there.<br><br>Do It Tomorrow: Did you notice when Mark trialed Super Auto Focus he announced what he wanted to achieve the next day?  In doing this, he didn't plan ahead and customize his AF list.  SAF just got those things done - and other stuff - without preplanning.  But the rules let you plan stuff out if you like.  Gather a list of things you want to do, add them to SAF, and do them AutoFocus style.  When you've made good progress, go through other pages of SAF and work on stuff.  You may carry a DIT task with you, and when that's done, pick another to take along.<br><br>---<br>Above I attempted to prove that SuperFocus does everything better.  Did I succeed?</div>

Thus, like SAF, you only have to worry about your current page and the pages near the end.<br><br>2) Because of the one entry point, all "active," especially unfinished, tasks, are at or near the end, and because of the highlighted character of unfinished tasks in DWM2, you are compelled to finish those tasks.  Currently I have no unfinished tasks past 2 days ago.<br><br>2) When you repeatedly work on the unfinished tasks, they keep on being added to the end.  Which means they keep on being highlighted and worked on until they are done.<br><br>And oh, DWM2 has one advantage over SAF: autonomy.  SAF for me had the added overhead/stress/complexity/whatever of you having to decide whether to dismiss a page or not.  In DWM2, it is time based and removes the decision from you, hence it is more autonomous.<br><br>God bless!</div>

<div class="content">well put. In fact it seems you trade one autonomy (freedom to navigate pages in DWM2) for  another (freedom to keep pages past-date) in SAF.   I like the latter. The former seems like it should work well , but it was a major problem for me.</div>

<div class="content"><<In fact it seems you trade one autonomy (freedom to navigate pages in DWM2) for another (freedom to keep pages past-date) in SAF.>><br><br>Alan, I find SAF dismisses pages much quicker than DWM. At least on my one-week trial, it has dismissed everything from 5 days ago! It was the same with AF1. I am still trying it, but DWM is much more paced to me.</div>

<div class="content">With DWM, this pace is automatic, and with SAF you control the pace.<br><br>It depends how quickly you go through the list, and how readily you work on other tasks.  If you do more things, and stick with them longer, you will have fewer dismissed pages.<br><br>Personally I don't have a problem with pages being dismissed after 5 days, because I have a system to manage dismissed tasks and bring them back later if they are important.</div>

<div class="content">"With DWM, this pace is automatic, and with SAF you control the pace."<br><br>DWM controls the pace of DISMISSAL but it sure doesn't control your working pace.  I actually very rarely dismiss things with DWM.  Whether that's because it's allowing me to keep more balls in the air or because I'm not taking on as much, I'm not sure.</div>

<div class="content">Wow you guys have got me thinking.  Each of Mark's systems have a rule to dismiss tasks.  I think it's unique to Mark, and it's one of his best ideas.  It keeps you honest.  <br><br>You folk have me convinced the DWM dismissal rule is much more powerful than just efficiently killing tasks.  Sounds enticing.  And yet the date thing still trips me up.  I'm champing for a rule of equivalent power that doesn't look at the calendar.</div>

<div class="content">I don't remember who suggested it, but for the past few months I've been using AF1 with the added rule that tasks get dismissed automatically after 3 weeks (or some other duration you prefer), which is similar to DWM.<br><br>Every day I start by adding a line that says "---- Dismissal 17 dec ----" for example, where December 17th is the day 3 weeks from now. So all tasks before that line get dismissed on that date automatically. So today I added the "---- Dismissal 17 dec ----" line and I dismissed all outstanding items before the "---- Dismissal 25 nov ----" line.<br><br>Calculating which day is 3 weeks from now may seem a little complicated, but basically you just look at yesterday's tasks and take the date you entered there and add 1.</div>

<div class="content">Maybe each time you fill a new page you close an old page? This will keep inflow=outflow.<br><br>That might be too strict. Sometimes we need to accept inflow that exceeds outflow, in the short term. Sometimes we write extra details, so new tasks use pages quickly. (If the quick phone call produces extra notes, I take them on whatever is handy. My Task book is handy and the notes won't get lost. Flipping to the back for a short note disrupts the conversation, and we all know what short notes often grow into.)<br><br>Maybe dismiss one page every day. If you add new pages slowly (perhaps by writing big tasks rather than little ones), use half-pages or remove a page every other day.<br><br>Each day, record the number of active pages. Each week, look at the record to see if it's growing or shrinking and why.<br><br>I expect the number will grow at first, as we brainstorm and bring more of our lives into the system. It will also grow when we are busy and shrink when we pull ahead. It will grow if we subdivide tasks more finely or take more notes than usual.<br><br>It will stay constant if we are staying even.<br><br>Another option is to track the number of active tasks. That will take longer, avoid the problem with embedded notes, but not solve the problem with differing granularity.<br><br>Yet another option is track total time committed. That will take even longer, and only work if we list all the subtasks in a project and estimate times accurately. I like time estimates when planning a day or week, but maybe not for this.</div>

<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>Cricket is right, the time-based dismissal should be nuanced to the specific management system to be used.  If the dismissal system is too slow, tasks will pile up.  If the system is too fast even important tasks will be dismissed before they are acted on.  DWM has consistently been shown to have a balanced time dismissal system.<br><br>God bless!</div>

<div class="content">Til:<br><br><< Calculating which day is 3 weeks from now may seem a little complicated, but basically you just look at yesterday's tasks and take the date you entered there and add 1. >><br><br>Another way is to number each day with the 26 letters of the English alphabet. As you start each new day, cross off the previous one which has the same letter. This has the advantage that if you are away for any complete days, you still get 26 active days in which to take action on a task.</div>

<div class="content">Nuntym, that's precisely my aim! The notion is that things progress according to how much work I do, not how much time passes.  DWM punished me if I pick up the list for 10 minutes because I'd lose a page. Granted I lose the reward of getting ahead of the calendar. It's a tradeoff.</div>

Granted I lose the reward of getting ahead of the calendar. It's a tradeoff. >><br><br>Alan: AF1/SF "punishes" me as well if I pick it up for 10 minutes. :) Yesterday morning I had 5 closed pages and 1 open page. By the end of the day, I had dismissed 4 pages because I had little discretionary time to work. That meant I mostly did one big thing, which kept being transferred to the 2nd column on other pages -- and, with nothing much else with which it could be alternated, there was mass dismissal. Down to 3 pages only today (2 closed, 1 open), but I am dreading my list a bit (only recurrent and Big Projects on it).<br><br>I'll see if I will have to reboot my experiment today with SF. I found it is even quicker than AF1 in dismissal, especially because my list tends to be much, much smaller. (I think I had 10-15 pages on AF1, now I have no more than 5 in SF). This might well be because I got used to DWM, which was more lenient and let me think about things for longer, in a different kind of way. I may not have found the sweet spot yet with SF.<br><br>The case seems then to be that (S)AF allows you to keep pages much past DWM's 30-day limit, and in my case (S)AF just allows me to keep pages for 7 (working) days on average. Therefore, you consider DWM dismissal to be too fast, while to me AF is too fast (at least my latest SF trial).</div>

<div class="content">This is exactly why I'm pondering a new rule like the "10 pages" rule.  With such, it wouldn't matter if you work lots or little, fast-through or slow-through.  I'm not ready to try that yet.<br><br>Given the AF1 rule, if you slow down just a bit Natalia, you won't dismiss as much.  Do one thing on the first page and dismiss nothing.  Advance a page, do one new thing, bring in that previous task, and do that.  10 minutes passed, you did two things, and lost nothing.  <br><br>In that situation, often I will use the time to plan what I will do when I have more time.  I.e. to do a little of X, I plan out the next step for X.<br><br>My other trick is to "dismiss to projects".  With this I take tasks slated for dismissal and put them into appropriate projects where they can be retrieved later.  This action is easier than dismissing outright.  It keeps the list trim, and provides a mechanism to bring things back at a more opportune time.  See the "My Project System" thread.<br><br>Currently I have 5 pages plus active project pages.</div>

<div class="content">Alan, the mass dismissal was inevitable this time because most things required me being at home, while I was working the list from work (as I said before, I have tried many things but the best peace-of-mind solution was one list only). I had the same happen in AF1, it just happened much earlier on in SF.<br><br>I just saw that thread, and I might experiment with Project System. But I found AF-like systems so good without project lists (that I had when GTDing), and I always like to try the vanilla versions of systems before any greater tweak. Thanks for pointing it out though!<br><br>I am listless today, I will reboot SF next week. Do let us know if you experiment with the page limit.</div>

<div class="content">Natalia, Mark recommends separate lists for home and work exactly because of the issue above.  But obviously that doesn't work for you.  So this is where I would urge you to take charge of the system.  Don't let it boss you around. Here's two possible solutions.  Choose one, or find a third.<br><br>1) Dismissing a page doesn't have to mean its contents are gone forever.  You can review the list and bring them back at another time.  For example, when you are home, review dismissed tasks, you may pull some out again because you now plan to work on them.<br>2) Mark each page as to whether it has (H)ome, (W)ork, or (H/W) Both tasks.  While at work you may freely ignore all pages which are Home only.<br><br>"Try vanilla versions of systems before any greater tweak" - Yep, and likewise I'm not experimenting with new dismissal rules for a while.  I'm quite occupied with proving the existing systems.</div>

<div class="content">Alan, thanks for your suggestions. (2) looks a bit like what I tried with stalactite-stalagmite. (1) requires a bit of overhead that I am now a bit lazy to deal with right now. So I decided to let go of SF for now and I am back to my old DWM2. :)<br><br>But one think if for sure: SF is super-super quick and effiicient.</div>
<h2>Reply by Alan Baljeu</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-11-29 13:33</div>
<div class="content">By 2 I didn't mean separating stuff.  I meant just labeling the top of the page as to what happens to be on it.  Enjoy DWM2!</div>
