<div class="content">"If the day and the night are such that you greet them with joy, and life emits a fragrance like flowers and sweet-scented herbs, is more elastic, more starry, more immortal — that is your success. All nature is your congratulation, and you have cause momentarily to bless yourself.

<div class="content">This reminds me of Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's book and concepts about Flow.  He seems to be trying to make a case that a life well-lived is a life lived in Flow.  It keeps you engaged, keeps you feeling happy and fulfilled, like you are doing the work you are meant to do.  At least, it accomplishes this "in the moment".  He gives dozens of examples:  Flow at work, Flow in relationships, Flow in conversation, etc.   If you've got Flow, you've got it All, he seems to be saying.<br><br><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/mihaly_csikszentmihalyi_on_flow?language=en" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.ted.com/talks/mihaly_csikszentmihalyi_on_flow?language=en</a><br><br>I think these concepts are useful and valuable, but Flow (success "in the moment") is only a piece of the puzzle.    It's useful and valuable to know how to structure one's work so as to stay in Flow (just using AF1 is really good at this!!), and feel very happy through the day about how much I am getting done, and how engaged I feel while doing it.   But I am not always happy with the overall results.   Flow isn't enough.  <br><br>I don't think there are any succinct pithy answers here:  no one single key to making it all work and achieving "success".  In the world of work, something like this "Lean Thinking House" is a good model that brings together many important concepts (including Flow), but doesn't put too much emphasis on any one of them:  <a href="http://www.craiglarman.com/wiki/index.php?title=Lean_Thinking_house" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.craiglarman.com/wiki/index.php?title=Lean_Thinking_house</a></div>
