<div class="content">Hi everyone. I am new to this and am very excited to find this method of handling tasks (Autofocus).  I am very muddled at the moment, and this seems a very simple and straightforward system which I think I can handle!  Other systems seemed complex and I have set them up then done nothing more with them. Another added bonus is I can use nice notebooks and my fountain pens which I love to do.<br><br>My situation:  is that I work mostly from home (wiht the odd day out for training courses I run and meetings) and I run two businesses. For one of the businesses I do more than one project for some customers. I have in the past found this hard to deal with - one list for each business and one for home?  One for each project? and so on.  The trouble is the more lists I have the less likely it is that I will look at them!  On the other hand, it's good to see tasks for different businesses/customers/home. I do get the occasional urgent tasks - but to be honest most of my urgent tasks come from being disorganised and not doing things when I should. I am a visual person so if I can't see something it sort of doesn't exist!!<br><br>My questions: How many lists would be best - should I colour code entries or just lump them all together?  How do I manage projects? (and would you include things like Christmas planning in wtih projects?) Do you keep your someday stuff in a separate notebook? <br><br>Sorry to ask all the questions.  This all seems a problem for me, but I have a feeling that some of you will have already found a solution that is easy to work with.</div>

<div class="content">Hi, Alison<br><br>Welcome to my site. I think you will find everyone very helpful here.<br><br>My recommendation is that you should keep one list for each location. Since you work from home, that would mean one list for you. There's no real need to colour-code and it's easiest just to lump everything in together. <br><br>Normal sized projects can usually be managed on the list, as long as you remember to include plenty of management tasks.<br><br>The sort of tasks I am talking about here begin with these sorts of verbs:<br><br>Think about…<br><br>Investigate…<br><br>Discuss… with …<br><br>Plan…<br><br>Review…<br><br>List…<br><br>You can probably think of more for yourself.<br><br>As for someday stuff, it's best to use the list only for projects which are active at the moment (or which you are thinking of making active). On the other hand when an idea comes to you, it's often a good idea to put it on the list as a query "Sail round the world next year?" if the answer is "no", then delete it and forget it. If the answer is "yes", start planning!</div>

<div class="content">Hi,<br>I've tried GTD then AF and now I'd like to stick with AF.<br>I have decided to keep 2 lists, one for work the other for home.<br>I tend to start each entry with the context like calls, wf, or the first name of my boss so I can quickly scan and find the items I need to discuss with him.<br>I carry a JR sized Levenger Circa foldover notebook which I love and I use it for my 2 lists as well as notes "on the fly"<br>I keep all "errands" in my Blackberry which is always with me, and I just use a legal pad at my desk for notes during my sales calls.<br>Any suggestions? Would you change anything?<br>Thanks!!</div>
