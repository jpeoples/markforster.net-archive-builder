<div class="content">I've refined this system for a year now.  It works with any AF, but especially well with SuperFocus.  The system now manages all activity in my life.<br><br>A project is defined as ANY tasks grouped for ANY reason.  Besides projects, this covers routines, tickler file, shopping lists, checklists, @waiting, contexts.<br><br>To create a project page, write the title at the top, and tasks down the side.  Add notes, diagrams at will.  Store these pages in a folder.<br><br>Rules:<br>	1. Use your AF as normal.<br>	2. You may take any AF task and put it into a project page.<br><br>SuperFocus only:<br>	3. At any time you may physically insert a project page into your SuperFocus pages, immediately after the active SF page.<br>	4. When working a project page, just follow SuperFocus rules.  [yes, all of them!]<br>	5. If you dismiss a project page, move it back to your projects folder.<br>Rules for other AF: upon request.<br><br>That's it!</div>

<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>So the project page becomes a part of the 2nd column? Nice, simple and elegant, Alan.  I like it! ^___^<br><br>Do you think it can be edited for DWM? I actually was thinking of something like this just this morning, but it was a bit clunky.<br><br>God bless!</div>

<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>Oh wait! I HAVE thought of something like this for DWM, months ago! It involves using a binder and separating each day with binder dividers like this:<br><br><a href="http://www.staples.com/Staples-Black-Leather-Tab-Dividers-1-31/product_483313?cm_mmc=GoogleBase-_-Shopping-_-Office_Supplies%3EIndex_Dividers-_-483313-13553/11485&cid=CSE:GoogleBase:Office_Supplies:Index_Dividers:483313:13553/11485" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.staples.com/Staples-Black-Leather-Tab-Dividers-1-31/product_483313?cm_mmc=GoogleBase-_-Shopping-_-Office_Supplies%3EIndex_Dividers-_-483313-13553/11485&cid=CSE:GoogleBase:Office_Supplies:Index_Dividers:483313:13553/11485</a><br><br>So each day becomes a division of the binder, thus you can insert pages in between, including whole projects.<br><br>I never did try it, however, as the original paper-based DWM never had appeal to me, and I hate using binders that big ^___^<br><br> God bless!</div>

<div class="content">Re "part of the second column".  No, the project becomes a SF page with its own second column. It works well because SF rules keep tasks on the page, exactly what you want of a project system.<br><br>I don't see a similar way with any other AF. I'll share the previous way tomorrow. It works great with any system, but lacks the same elegance.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Alan: <br><br>In other words, projects and lists are maintained as separate pages until such time as you wish to work on them, presumably with a reference to them in the main AF list, for eg "Do Project X"?<br><br>Would that be a fair paraphrase of the system?</div>

<div class="meta">2010-11-26 4:58</div>
<div class="content">I think JD, what you say is essentially right.  Following SF, you may add any task any time to the current page if you intend to do it. Here, you do the same with a project page. It could start like you say, or any other trigger could do that.<br><br>I recommend a recurring task "review projects", wherein you look through the lot and may pick one to work on.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Alan for that very helpful tip to add a "review projects" task to the mix. I do keep separate lists and projects when it makes sense to have them grouped, but did not apply SF rules to them. This is a really neat way of handling them.<br><br>For me, some project tasks just get written down on the SF list, bypassing the project list altogether. I allow them to float around so long as it feels natural.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Alan<br>You system is interesting. Would you post a picture of a sample to see it. <br>Do you do it on paper or digital on word or excel ? <br>Thanks</div>

<div class="content">Thank Jupiter.  It's hard to take a picture of multiple pages, so I'll try to explain instead.  My current SF pages at work are:<br><br>C, Calendar, E, Delegating, Newsletter, F, XMD-S, G.  <br><br>The letters are ordinary pages.  D was dismissed some time ago.  <br>"Calendar" has dated things.  There are some today-things on it.  It will be dismissed to the Projects notebook when I have nothing further to work on.<br>"Habits" (not here) is a project I recently dismissed.  It tells me what I need to do when I enter the office.  Later I will pick it up again for things I need to do when I leave the office.<br><br>At work I use OneNote, and my SF pages are actually OneNote sections, and my tasks are actually OneNote pages.   (So if I get an email of something to do, I "Send To OneNote", and it's already in the system.)<br><br>At home I use paper, a clipboard, and store inactive project pages in a binder.</div>

<div class="content">I should explain some things: <br>1. A project page usually isn't full.  So according to SF you may add tasks to the page when you wish.<br>2. Many "projects" are recurring, so when you finish a task, you will want to enter it again.<br>3. Checklists are a special case.  Same rules apply but record things differently: Rather than cross-out and re-enter items, just put a checkmark right of the task it's done.  Next time you go through this checklist, add another column of checks.</div>

<div class="content">Question: say you're working on a project page that you've inserted into your regular Super Focus pages. Do you mean that you add ANY task to the 2nd column? Or just tasks related to that project?<br><br>In other words, if the project pages is "Rebuild the Chimney" but you get a phone call to "pay credit card by end of day", would you add that new urgent task to the project page?</div>
<h2>Reply by Alan Baljeu</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-11-28 2:53</div>
<div class="content">Absolutely. Assuming you are focused on chimneys for a while, Next time you take a break you can use that opportunity to go pay the credit card- which you remember because it's written in front of you. <br><br>As another example, I created a project called Tonight and wrote in it all the Various things I wanted done this evening.  I've been busybeeing all about doing stuff on this page without needing to consult the rest of the list. But I added a few things that came to mind and did those too. <br><br>Of course things you don't want to do in the current context  (and this is more usual) go to the last page.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Alan,<br><br>I know you're doing AF4R now, so this doesn't apply to you anymore, but I have a question about SAF with projects nevertheless.<br><br>Assume I have a project page with 3 tasks in my stack of SAF pages. When I come to this project page, I am *obligated* to do at least one task of the project or else the project page (and thus the project) has to be dismissed, just like in the normal AF1/SAF rules?<br><br>On the one hand this seems awfully strict to me, but then again... I guess it encourages the little-and-often approach... right?</div>

<div class="content">"5. If you dismiss a project page, move it back to your projects folder."<br><br>You can bring the page back later, so it's really not that harsh a rule to follow.<br><br>In fact I'm still doing this, but within AF4R instead.  Slightly different rules apply there.</div>

<div class="content">Alan, I just discovered this thread. I like it!<br>It would go nicely with those "doodled" project pages we talked about too.<br>Are you still doing this?</div>
<h2>Reply by Alan Baljeu</h2>
<div class="meta">2011-04-6 12:34</div>
<div class="content">I do, but without inserting the pages into SF. Keep in mind that this is the old SuperFocus where stuff got reentered on the current page. That kept the projects intact. New SF wouldn't make sense to do this.</div>
