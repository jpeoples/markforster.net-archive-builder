<div class="content">I'm puzzled about the dismissal aspect, and how it works with the idea of going back to "still active" pages.<br><br>The system's rules include the following:<br><br>a. "Don’t move onto the next page until you complete a pass of the page without any item standing out"<br><br>and<br><br>b. "If you go to a page and no item stands out for you on your first pass through it, then all the outstanding items on that page are dismissed without re-entering them."<br><br>So doesn't that mean that you will only move forward to the next page once you have either completed or dismissed every item on the current page. And so iIn that case, how can the following rule ever actually be used:<br><br>c. "Once you’ve finished with the last page, re-start at the first page that is still active."<br><br>Don't a and b together imply that there will *never* be any active pages prior to the last page? <br><br>What am I missing?<br></div>

<div class="content">The video here should help clear up some things for you.<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2009/2/15/at-last-autofocus-the-video.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2009/2/15/at-last-autofocus-the-video.html</a><br><br>But, taking your concerns one at a time. <br><br>>>>>><br>a. "Don’t move onto the next page until you complete a pass of the page without any item standing out"<br><br>and<br><br>b. "If you go to a page and no item stands out for you on your first pass through it, then all the outstanding items on that page are dismissed without re-entering them."<br><br>So doesn't that mean that you will only move forward to the next page once you have either completed or dismissed every item on the current page. <br><<<<<<br><br>Actually, as long as you have worked on at least one item on your current page, you can move on to the next page. So you don't have to complete all of the items on page 5 before moving on to page 6. Even if you've done just one thing on page 5, you can move on to page 6. And you don't dismiss any of the items on page 5 because you worked on at least one of them.<br><br>You only dismiss a page if you come to it and *none* of the items stand out, and you don't do anything on any of the items left. <br><br>>>>>><br>c. "Once you’ve finished with the last page, re-start at the first page that is still active."<br><br>Don't a and b together imply that there will *never* be any active pages prior to the last page? <br><<<<<<br><br>Like I said, since you don't have to complete all of the items on a page before moving on, you will definitely have active pages. And plenty of them.</div>

<div class="content">Here's how I think about it:<br><br>"I have to do at least *one* thing on each page before I can turn to the next one."<br><br>[Or, if I can't do that, then I have to highlight everything... but that's admitting defeat :-)]</div>

<div class="content">@Deet,<br><br>Thanks for the input. But in fact it was watching the video that confused me. Mark clearly goes back to a page he has "visited many times before" and finally decides to dismiss the items. Question is, how can such a page exist? You said:<br><br>> ... as long as you have worked on at least one item on your current page, you can<br>> move on to the next page. <br><br>Fair enough, but that is not AutoFocus. Mark says clearly:<br><br>"Don’t move onto the next page until you complete a pass of the page without any item standing out"<br><br>So you don't get to move on just because you've worked on at least one item. You get to move on only if you've done a pass and no item stood out. And *if* you do a pass such that no item stands out, then you're supposed to dismiss the remaining items:<br><br>"If you go to a page and no item stands out for you on your first pass through it, then all the outstanding items on that page are dismissed without re-entering them."<br><br>--</div>

<div class="content">Tommy:<br><br>What you are missing is the rather important word "first" in your final quote from the instructions. <br><br>You only dismiss items if nothing stands out for you on your FIRST pass through a pass when you visit it, i.e. if you don't do at least one item on that page that visit.</div>

<div class="content">@Mark,<br><br>Ahhh. I'd noticed that, but didn't see the significance. Thanks! That explains it.<br><br>OK, so one more question - for precise clarification. When you say "first", do you mean the first pass after the quick skim? Or do you mean the quick skim itself. (I assume the former).<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Tommy:<br><br>On the quick skim you are not aiming to do any tasks anyway, so yes you are correct: it's the first pass after the quick skim.</div>
