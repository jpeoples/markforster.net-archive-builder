<div class="content">For starters: So far, my experience of AF is increasingly positive; and as a relative novice to time management approaches who has a history of chaotic working practices, that's saying something.<br><br>In skimming over the forum posts, there seems to be a limited amount of discussion about the process of choosing which 'stand out' task to work on (in fact, there seems far more discussion in the type of notebook one should use. 33 lined A4 hardback notebook from Tesco for 80p is my weapon of choice, by the way).<br><br>I'm aware that Mark advises not to "prioritise items mentally" but to "wait for a feeling of release." I'm also aware that he indicates it is a practice that is easier to do than it is to describe. I'm wondering, however, whether it comes easier to those of you who have arrived at AF with a strong background in time management techniques, and therefore are more attuned to this elusive "feeling of release" and less prone to mentally prioritise without meaning to?<br><br>One of Moises' posts mentioned his sense of feeling burdened to complete tasks on one page, because he was desperate to get to the page upon which he knew he had something urgent to do. I can identify with some of this desperation, although I recognise one has to (a) use one's common sense to override the system at times of significant urgency, and (b) gradually grow to trust the system over time.<br><br>I also wonder how much of the 'feeling of release' may come easier to some personality types, and less to others?<br><br>Any old hands or fellow-novices want to offer their opinion?</div>

<div class="content">I would certainly agree that certain types of personality would find this approach much easier than others. Being one of those creative, intuitive types by nature, I find it almost too obvious for words what this "feeling of release" is about.<br><br>But having known some personalities that I would call "analytical" in nature, I know I would struggle greatly trying to make them understand.<br><br>But then again, those analytical types would probably be quite happy with the classic "state a measurable goal - define each detailed step to get there - measure your progress every day" time management approaches that the creative, intuitive types feel is imprisoning.<br><br>I'm pretty sure the target audience for Autofocus could be accurately charted with the Myers-Briggs personality-type definitions that many corporations favour these days.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Neumatist<br><br>I would agree with Frank that it is highly probable that personality type etc would make it easier for some than others but also previous training and working practices.  I would class myself as creative and intuitive by nature but worked in an analytical environment, solving problems, where I believe creativity in looking for solutions gave an edge.<br><br>I have looked at various time management and other professional development systems and had no problem understanding the concept of the "feeling of release" BUT it took me a long time to actually get how it worked in practice,  The fact that I had already worked through that barrier I believe gave me a real head start in using AF.<br><br>It is incredibly hard to explain, the closest I can come to it is saying it is the item you "feel" like doing.  Our rational mind says "well that's ridiculous, of course I will feel like doing "fun" things but I will never "feel" like doing my tax return, or that client report or cleaning the car.  Those are things that just have to be done".  In practice however that does not happen to the extent we believe it will.  Inexplicably we will "feel" like doing many of those "non-fun" things, and those that we don't will cause us to question those tasks and their place in our lives.<br><br>Nevertheless there will always be some things that we will not want to do but must do and that does need to be kept in mind.  I cannot imagine ever "feeling" that I want to go to the dentist, but it must be done.  It can take a while to learn to go with what you feel but it gets easier with practice.<br><br>Frank, it would be very interesting if we all compared out Myers-Briggs typing - perhaps someone should start a post ........ :-)</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Frank & Christine - you've reassured and offered hope to this slow starter.</div>

<div class="content">Christine,<br><br>Sometimes I am INTJ (in which case you should start the thread) but also probably sometimes ENTJ (in which case I should start the thread)  <grin></div>

<div class="content">I have to confess to being ENTJ but recall I was borderline something else -  if it was INTJ I guess we'd both have to start the thread :-)</div>

<div class="content">The similarity is very interesting indeed. I wonder then if there really is an obvious personality type that Autofocus appeals to.<br><br>To find out, I bow to your undoubtedly superior ENTJ-ness and shall pass the thread-starting baton to your kind self. <grin></div>

<div class="content">Gee thanks Frank!  My AF'd intuition is not shouting at me on that task so it seems clear to me that, as you first raised the subject the honour should definitely be yours!!   Besides, methinks I post too much!  :-)  Will be happy to contribute tho'  <grin></div>

<div class="content">Well, just for the sake of empirical data collection (and while no thread on this has yet been started), I'm INFJ, borderline INTJ. That was about 12 years ago... do these things change over time?</div>

<div class="content">Hi folks!<br><br>No idea what INTJ, ENTJ, Myers-Briggs, etc. even means but I'll have a bash at answering Neumatist's query about "standing out"!<br><br>I found that if I substituted "catches my attention" for "stands out" then it was very clear which task to do - the one that MOST caught my attention as I scanned the list the second, slower time. Often this may be a task that I really don't like the idea of but when I scanned, it jumped out more than any of the others and shouted "DO ME FIRST!!". <br><br>As the list on each page gets smaller this feeling of dread at starting an outstanding task heightens but does go away when I think to myself 'if I just do the tiniest thing on it' such as 'get out the file' or 'look up xyz on the interweb', then the resistance to do the task fades. Also I often find that when I've made that start then somehow by magic it's finished in one go as it was the thought of starting it pre-Autofocus that was most holding me back. Of course, sometimes there are tasks on my list that I'm never going to 'want' to do but even these become much easier if I chip away at them bit by tiny bit - sometimes rephrasing the task to make it less threatening can also help. E.g. instead of 'do project X' I might have to rephrase it to 'begin project X' which isn't nearly so scary.<br><br>If I have two or more tasks that jump out then I just compare them with each other and see which one 'feels' like it should be done first, or even which I feel like doing first. In a way it doesn't matter as they'll all get done eventually. If one is much more urgent than another and the consequences of not doing it are fairly dire then you again have answered your question as to which to do.<br><br>I hope this helps...</div>

<div class="content">Even if Autofocus mostly helps the *NTJs of the world, *NTJs tend to be leaders (either quiet behind the scenes like INTJs, or openly like ENTJs), so helping them helps everyone.  :-)</div>

<div class="content">LOL - That's great Frank.  I'm so glad I had a few hours away from my computer today :-)<br><br>Mind you it's pretty sad that it's now 1:00 am and I was drawn to check out the forum.  I'm grateful to Seraphim too - it's so long since I did my MBTI that I couldn't recall what the different typings signified - cue new task "find MBTI books".</div>
