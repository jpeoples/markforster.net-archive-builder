<div class="content">Hello,<br><br>I am interested in getting some feedback on my attempt at making a DWM-style todo list web app. <br><br>Please play with it and let me know what you think about my approach.  It is extremely basic right now, I am just trying to implement the core functionality of DWM.  Do you think I've captured it?<br><br><a href="http://focus.lrn.gd/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://focus.lrn.gd/</a><br><br>Add tasks and then click on the 'focus' link.  Login with test/test if you don't want to make your own account.<br><br> It is very much a work in progress, with an incredibly ugly appearance :-).  Unfortunately, I am not good at web design.</div>

<div class="content">James, although I still intend to stay manual, I had a very quick look.<br><br>It looks promising.  I like the use of 28 days which I use for my current manual/paper methof and which is the best for me since the early days of AF1.<br><br>For me, any task which has a true/real deadline date between now and day 28 needs to have that shown as well.  Yes, it can still be entered in Day 28.<br><br>BTW, this post may not be published, not all have been since I arrived here in Damascus for a year's assignment.</div>

<div class="content">I had a look as well... I think it's got potential.  Right now obviously we're only seeing things on pages W and M.  How will items on the pages in between be displayed?  As for Roger's concern about deadlines, one could simply do what many of us do right now - append it in parentheses at the end (and I did create such an entry in the "test" account).<br><br>A couple of things I would like to see:<br>The date.  This is, of course, relevant to the deadline issue.<br>A way to indicate that a task is COMPLETED in the task list view.  Is this what the "remove" function is intended for?  To me, "remove" suggests deciding NOT to do something rather than completing it.  Yes, I'm picking nits.</div>

<div class="content">Roger,<br><br>I chose the use of 28 days/4 weeks, because I thought it was more symmetrical, a task that was added on a wednesday might be a wednesday-only task, which might be started 4 weeks from now.<br><br>Sarah,<br><br>Did you try the 'Focus' link?<br><br>The 'Remove' actually destroys the task permanently.  The only way to mark a task as DONE, is to 'Do' a task and then choose 'Done'.  I need to figure out how to make that more intuitive.<br><br>Right now completed tasks aren't shown at all, I will have to add that.<br><br>Both,<br><br>The in-between pages will appear over time, but I agree about adding deadline support.<br><br>I was thinking of supporting the ability to enter "Task due:<date>" and having it put in the right spot.</div>

<div class="content">Erm..<br><br>By "In-betwen pages" I mean "In-between tasks", the tasks that will appear between the default W/M, and between D/W too.</div>

<div class="content">James,<br><br>I agree wholeheartedly about "28" being symmetrical, it helps keep those weekend tasks in sync as well as those work and other ones that can only be done on a certain day of the week.<br><br>I'm not sure if your first versions should worry about Completed tasks, rather tag Dismissed tasks for a future review, eg send them to a box/folder/bucket (virtual, not real!) tagged Dismissed for Review.  <br><br>But then one of the advantages of the manual/paper approach is one can see those completed tasks in any time.  To be honest, having waxed and waned between manual and digital since AF1 and currently most satisfied with manual/paper, I hardly ever look at old pages.  I prefer to deal with everything on a page at day's end (or the next morning) to make sure everything has a line through it, even the dismissed ones.  But I can tell the difference in the way I put the line though a task or the colour of a line (use blue for Re--entered, red for Dismissed). <br><br>Keep at it James, you will learn much from a DWM and application development view, who knows, maybe my next digital approach will be yours!</div>
