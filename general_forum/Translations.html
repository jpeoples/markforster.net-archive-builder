<div class="content">Having been away from the Forum for a week or so I've rather lost touch of how many translations have been done of Revised Autofocus. The ones I've linked to on the instruction page are:<br><br>Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Dutch, Estonian, French, German, Italian, Japanese (two versions).<br><br>To save me reading through every item on the Forum, it would be a great help to me if anyone who knows of (an)other version(s) could post the link(s) here, and I will copy them onto the instruction page.<br><br>Thanks in advance!</div>

<div class="content">Well, there is the Spanish translation by Walter: <a href="http://wiki.autofocus.cc/Spanish_Translation" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.autofocus.cc/Spanish_Translation</a> - I think you have the other ones in the wiki.<br></div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Andreas and Walter. <br><br>I've also found Dorinem's Russian translation (for which many thanks, Dorinem). <br><br>Anyone else know of any more? Or wants to produce any more? All languages welcome!</div>
