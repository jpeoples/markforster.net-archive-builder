<div class="content">I don't think that was the idea michael.  I think the idea is you continue acting, but you take a perspective that things aren't as urgent and all-encompassing of your time, therefore you can react favorably to new things.</div>

<div class="content">Let me put my point another way.<br><br>One reason AF works well is that after each action one can pause and make a new decision - this resting before next step allows a valuable re-assessment of a new situation and a new mood or state in oneself. Forcing along one straight-line of action doesn't allow this. Progress is often more zig-zag or curving. Relaxation supports insights and inspirations (intuitive brain, non-linear).</div>
