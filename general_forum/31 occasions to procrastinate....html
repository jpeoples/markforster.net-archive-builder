<div class="content">I've been using AF from day 1, and with great effect. I get lots more done, and most importantly, a lot of the procrastination I previously experienced has simply evaporated.<br><br>However, I'm noticing a slightly worrying trend. Some items still seem to create resistance and stay on the page until the last possible moment, i.e. when all the other items have been tackled and I need to decide whether to act or dismiss. This can still be OK, except when these items are related to time-sensitive tasks that I *have* to do, which then risk getting overdue. So basically, as I'm using a notebook with 32 items per page, this theoretically gives me the opportunity to procrastinate on these items for 31 passes through the page (in the limit case where I would only action 1 single item per pass).<br><br>Obviously, by the time this happens I'll already have realised the problem, and this should trigger some reflection about the nature of the task and the resistance I'm feeling towards it. But in those cases where I have little choice and am really supposed to do the task by a certain date, I have some concern.<br><br>Do others here experience the same, and what do you do about it?</div>

<div class="content">I use brute force and remind myself that everything in life doesn't have to be easy or fun - often the most important things are neither fun nor easy.  <br><br>I also spend some time considering how I can get it done in a way that will make it easier on myself to do - maybe even pleasurable?  Also consider the benefit of how you will get a big load off your mind and feeling of accomplishment once you do it.    <br><br>Good luck Marc!!</div>

<div class="content">Marc, I've found that when that has happened to me on what I consider to be "important" items that I cannot dismiss, that there is usually some very specific reason for that procrastination, and not always directly related to the task itself.  Reasons such as conflict issues, in that actioning the task could either bring you into a conflict situation or remind you of a conflict situation. Or financial reasons - again this may not be a direct financial consequence but the fact that it has some emotional attachment to a financial issue.  Or it could be that you have an ethical issue with something related to the task, or that you just do not like your job.  Whatever the reason do be prepared to spend some time considering the possible reason/s ("thinking time" is a useful task!) Of course there are some items that we do just need to grit our teeth and get on with but don't do that too readily or you may miss the real issue.</div>

<div class="content">Marc:<br><br>Your mind is aware of the fact that the tasks have to be done by a certain time, so usually the answer is to trust the system and the tasks will get done before the deadline in spite of your worries. <br><br>If that doesn't happen, then you do need to ask some basic questions about the nature of the task, as Christine and Jacqueline have indicated.<br><br>Don't forget the common-sense rule: "If something needs to be done now, then do it now."</div>
