<div class="content">I recently re-read DIT and really liked the idea of “little and often’ and current initiative. Visited this site and decided to try AF1 because of its simplicity.<br><br>Been using AF1 for 8 days now. Was doing ToodleDo (before that RTM) but spent about as much time tinkering with due dates, priorities, categories, and folders as I did actually working.<br><br>At first I loved AF1 and saw a boost in productivity. (But honestly, every system seems great to me at first and then I get bored with it or something.)<br><br>Here is what I like about AF1:<br>1. Pull not push <br>2. Paper based – it really is easier<br>3. Not wasting as much time tinkering with the system itself<br>4. Simple<br><br>Here’s what I don’t like:<br>1. Dismissing tasks and making pages inactive…<br>Confession: I have yet to make a single page inactive! I know that’s probably why I’m starting to feel bogged down. The list is getting long (7 pages) and I'm starting to feel overwhelmed again. Also starting to see things listed twice and its hard to find tasks when i look for them.<br><br>I have completed many tasks and HAVE dismissed quite a few.  I find it difficult to let go of them but agree this helps me focus on “today” and “not today” and gets rid the many “someday/maybe” things that don’t really have to be done and that distract and overwhelm me.<br><br>But I go back to my first page…and there are things on here that I really do need to DO!!! I just don’t want to do them TODAY. How do I just dismiss and not relist if they are things that DO have to be done?<br><br>(It also bugs me that dismissed items are highlighted because my eye always goes to them and not to the things on the list left to be done.)<br><br>2. Not having categories. <br>Yes, I spent too much time on that before but I do miss having a list of phone calls or errands or things I want to look up on the internet when I have some time to do those things. Not a biggie but I have thought about cheating and putting in little symbols. It also bothers me sometimes to have the important and crucial all jumbled up with the most mundane. (I work from home and do have personal and work together.) <br><br>3. How/where do I outline the steps of project. (One thing I liked about ToodleDo was subtasks and notes.)<br><br>I know this post covers a lot of ground but I'd appreciate any suggestions to get me back on track.</div>

I suggest you re-read the rules on dismissal carefully.<br><br><< But I go back to my first page…and there are things on here that I really do need to DO!!! I just don’t want to do them TODAY.

So there shouldn't be a problem.<br><br><< Not having categories. >><br><br>You've stated yourself what the problem with categories is.  One tends to spend more time categorising and re-arranging and prioritising than you do doing the work. However it's your system, so if you want to use a few symbols by all means do. Only just use it where it's really necessary, not for every task. My own view however is that SF works better without.<br><br><< How/where do I outline the steps of project? >><br><br>In the project documentation - which may just be a file or even a sheet of paper somewhere. Most small projects don't need the steps outlining. Really big projects need a lot more documentation than you can fit on a time management list. There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question.</div>

<div class="content">Welcome, Bliss!<br><br>All the things you mentioned can easily be solved using AF1.  However you may want to consider the new SuperFocus (SF).  It's only slightly more complex than AF1, works in the same fashion, and in the end seem to work better.<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2011/2/10/rules-for-superfocus.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2011/2/10/rules-for-superfocus.html</a><br><br>By the way, "dismissed" doesn't mean gone forever.  It means you put the page aside until you get around to reviewing dismissed pages.  A task called "Review dismissed pages" should be on your list.  When you review these pages, you may delete some tasks or re-enter some.  For the latter, make sure you figured out why you ignored it last time, and are sure things will be different this time.</div>

<div class="content">Mark, <br>THANK YOU so much for the suggestions. Hope you are feeling better today. <br><br>What I was doing was getting rid of a few that I know I'm not going to do right now but I shouldn't dismiss any task until i go through the page and there is no task on there that I am willing to move forward in some way TODAY, is that right? Then I dismiss everything that I'm not going to do today.<br><br>And you're right - I have had multiple chances to do the items left on my first page but I guess I don't think they're ready to be done yet. But  they DO have to be done so i don't want to dismiss them - maybe they go in a tickler file or calendar? Or maybe I have to take even the tiniest of actions so I can re-list. ;) Thanks for the feedback on categories and outlining also. <br><br>And Alan, thank you for suggesting "review dismissed tasks." That feels better. :) And I will look at SF again.</div>

<div class="content">Bliss, I've also long struggled with the idea of not wanting to dismiss anything cause everything i put on there is important, in fact, I still do. <br><br>I'm realizing this is due to not following the little-and-often principle at all. When I feel this resistance it's because I tend to view tasks as a whole (needing to be completed in one go). <br><br>This is contrary to the principles behind AF. AF simply wont work if you view each task as one big scary thing needing lots of time blocked off to do it. It will lead to just the sort of bind you are in (lots of pages, with tasks needing to be done, but not done, and always running into them thinking "I should do this, just not now"). <br><br>Instead when you get to it, just do something small, 5 min, 10 min, and write it again at the end. If you can't do even that much, then you have to dismiss it and seriously think about rewording it or if it needs to be done at all, as per the original instructions.</div>

<div class="content">Thankis, OhNiners. You are spot on and what you describe is exactly the kind of thinking that has always gotten me into trouble! Old habits...<br><br>I was just reading another thread where someone asked how many pages people get through in a day. They said the last page seems like a far-off land that you know you're not going to get to for many days. That's me...in 8 days I hadn't dismissed a single page, which I knew wasn't right. I was loving this system when when my list was short and do-able and not all clogged up.<br><br>So I think I do need to scale my tasks down smaller and make myself at least pull out the folder or whatever to move my projects forward.<br><br>Thanks again - a big help.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Bliss149,<br><br>"What I was doing was getting rid of a few that I know I'm not going to do right now but I shouldn't dismiss any task until i go through the page and there is no task on there that I am willing to move forward in some way TODAY, is that right? Then I dismiss everything that I'm not going to do today."<br><br>I notice that you are referring to 'today' here, while in fact it should be 'at this very moment'. When you come to a new page and there is not a single task that you are willing to move forward on right now at this very moment, than all tasks are dismissed (highlighted).<br><br>When you then come to your task "Review dismissed tasks" you can go through the highlighted tasks and cross off all tasks that you do not intend to do any time soon (in the next few weeks), you can re-add all tasks that you do need to do or do intend to do, and add anything else to a tickler file for "some day".<br><br>As Alan already mentioned, do try to rephrase tasks when you re-add them or split them up into several tasks since that may make it easier for you to actually do them. Otherwise you might end up dismissing and re-adding them again without making any progress.<br><br>I would also suggest that you try out SuperFocus. It really is a big improvement on AutoFocus 1 and is only slightly more complex.</div>

<div class="content">Thank you, Tijl.. Good distinction -not today, right NOW.<br><br>And how funny OhNiners! I'm delighted to hear that it is working well for you now that you're doing "little and often." And are you still doing the AF1 or do you do the SF?</div>

<div class="content">I think the first thing people should do when they look at TM is to think about what they need the system to do for them and bring that criteria into the analysis of the system.  I am with you on dismissal.  I personally focus on what I am doing and not what I am not doing and do not use dismissal rules for pages.  I only look at the task level and do not dismiss entire pages.  The whole thought process of that and trying to think of the rules around it and worry about dismissing things I was not focused on at the minute just made no sense to me.  <br><br>That said you can use a simple AF system and not use dismissal of pages and it will work just great.  What I would suggest is just cross out individual tasks you no longer want or need to do and when you run out of space in the notebook you are using, prune some more when you create your next list.<br><br>Good luck <br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">i.e. when your notebook is full, dismiss whatever tasks you don't feel like copying into the next notebook.  <br><br>Seems to me a fair replacement for AF1's dismiss by page. As long as you have some way to ensure dead stuff gets killed, it will work.</div>
