<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>Happy Holidays!<br><br>I mentioned in <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1348080#item1348251" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1348080#item1348251</a> that I am currently trialing another task management system and waiting for it to stabilize before posting the full instructions.  Well, I have been using it for about a week with no change in processing since (I think) day 2, with closed lists dismissed at least once a day with no decline in effectiveness and efficiency noted, so I think it's stable enough for publication and critique.<br><br>I. Introduction<br>You guys may be wondering why I changed my TMS when I was previously very enthused with DWM2.  Well, I am STILL very enthusiastic for DWM2, and I haven't given up on it yet (my list's hidden in a drawer), but I couldn't deny that DWM2 (at least in my use, I do not know about others) has some problems as well.  The root of them is DWM2's sedate, though strict, day-based dismissal system: it is too slow, the list has ballooned to 20 pages full of crossed-out items with some to-be-done tasks spread in between (it ain't pretty...) which interferes with my intuition that is the hallmark of Mark's AF/DWM systems.  Further, I experienced more and more the truth of Mark's opinion that my own version of DWM2 weakened its rationale for using a weekly-dismissal process.<br><br>To cope with these problems, I tried using a three-task system (3TS) with a provision for urgent tasks (I described it here: <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1346124#item1346300" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1346124#item1346300</a> ).  I was surprised with how well it handled projects and tasks in general (but especially urgent tasks) that it became a permanent part of my DWM2.<br><br>However, I remembered Mark's analysis that 3TS is best used with AF4, the AF version I coincidentally have most experience with, so I tried it.  I also incorporated ALL the things I learned about Mark's systems for the past year that I can cram into the system, and the result was a surprisingly nimble little monster of a TMS ^__^ Monster in that it can eat, err, accept anything I throw at it; little in that it always presents me with only the relevant tasks for consideration; nimble in that although it required some headroom for running and maintaining it, it is very little in contrast to the benefits I got.  I like it very much so far.<br><br>II. Instructions<br>Since the TMS is in essence AF4+3TS with more than a handful of tweaks added to it, I will present it as layers of added tweaks to a base of AF4 with notes on the rationale for the additions.<br><br>A. AF4: <a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2009/9/5/preliminary-instructions-for-autofocus-v-4.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2009/9/5/preliminary-instructions-for-autofocus-v-4.html</a><br><br>A1. Instructions<br>See the link above<br><br>A2. Comments<br>As I said, AF4 is the AF version that I had most experience with since I used it the longest.  The strength of AF4 is the balanced handling of old and new tasks.  Its problem is that it can quite easily be bogged down: AF4 will breakdown in effectiveness as the total number of tasks approaches 200, in my experience.  It also suffers the inherent weakness of other AFs in that more important tasks may be lost in a sea of mundane tasks.  These problems will be tackled by the tweaks to follow.<br><br>B. Tagging (thanks to Alan Baljeu for the term ^__^) and AF4R processing<br><br>B1. Instructions<br><br>Follow AF4 rules with the addition of these tweaks<br>B1a) Tag each entered task with these symbols:<br>> New task<br>o Finished recurrent task<br>● Unfinished task<br><br>B1b) Work on the closed list until you are done for the moment, then process the open list until you are done for the moment, then rinse; at least one task (hopefully more) must be done in the closed list upon transferring there, otherwise all remaining old tasks are dismissed.<br><br>B2. Comments<br>The rationale for the first tweak is that tagging will facilitate in applying the next tweaks; the second tweak is necessary to exploit the tags in processing Unfinished Tasks.<br><br>Now as you can see, by these tweaks I actually had replicated Mark's AF4R but in a long list format instead of a list in columns.  Because of this, there is actually threat of dismissing Unfinished and Recurrent Tasks which was missing in AF4R.  What was surprising with this tweak is that >>it is more powerful than my version of DWM2 in processing Unfinished Tasks.<<  In DWM2 the threat for not doing Unfinished Tasks is the dismissal after 7 days.  In this AF4, the threat of dismissal is more acute.  It also facilitates in focusing on either New/Old Tasks or Recurrent Tasks only.  <br><br>However, the AF4 list can still get very large and inefficient.  That problem will be tackled by the next tweak.<br><br>C.</div>

<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>[I am sorry, I didn't realize that I accidentally sent my unfinished draft of this post earlier.  Anyways I'll just continue it. <br><br>Please note that this post is a continuation of the post above. ]<br><br>C.  Mike's "Filtering/Pre-Filtering" AF4 tweak: <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/883672" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/883672</a> ; summary: <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1262814#item1265787" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1262814#item1265787</a><br><br>C1.  Instructions<br>C1a) Decide the length of time into the future for which your AF4 will be relevant.  For example, you expect your AF4 will be relevant up to a week from now, or it will be relevant up to this coming Sunday.<br>C1b) Decide on a symbol or symbols to tag dismissed items using just your pen (I use "H" before the task item and crossing the task out with a line).  Make sure that the dismissed item can still be read, and make sure this is how you will always dismiss (NOT delete) items from now on. (NOTE: Deleted items are items crossed out because they have been done.  Dismissed items are items that are not done but crossed out because either of AF4's dismissal rules or because of the following tweak. Dismissed items were originally crossed out using a highlighter in Mark's instructions)<br>C1c) Upon entering or re-entering an item into your AF4 list, ask yourself: "Can I do or at the very least start this task within the relevant time I decided upon?" If yes, write it down as is.  If not, write it down then dismiss it immediately.<br>C1d) While processing the AF4 list, any item that stands out because it seems it cannot be done in the relevant period of time can be dismissed right away.<br>C1e) This next step cannot be emphasized enough: If you are going to use this tweak, review regularly, at least once every relevant time period.  Set up a system for reviewing dismissed tasks AND STICK WITH IT.  This can be done by setting aside a weekly review period and/or adding a "Review dismissed items" task in your AF.<br><br>C2. Comments<br>The comments I placed in my summary of Mike's tweak are still relevant: <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1262814#item1265787" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1262814#item1265787</a><br><br>Now the main effect of this tweak is that only RELEVANT TASKS are presented to you all the time, yet the AF4 can still accept anything and everything you can throw at it.  It becomes a true "grasscatcher" of all ideas and responsibilities that you have, yet your AF4 remains very nimble.  RECURRENT tasks also become manageable.  Finally, you will have a "SOMEDAY/MAYBE" list integrated into your AF4.<br><br>D. 3TS, Revised: <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1346124#item1346300" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1346124#item1346300</a><br><br>D1. Instructions<br>D1a) Use the system rules as they stand to choose an item<br>D1b) Delete the item from the AF4 list and write it in a separate piece of paper, eg. the back of your notebook (let's call this the 3TS paper)<br>D1c) Repeat step D1a-D1b until you have three tasks in your 3TS paper.<br>D1d) Do the three tasks you wrote in any way and order you want.<br>D1e) If you have to do an urgent task, write the urgent task into the 3TS paper with a symbol to tag it (I use a + before the task). YOU MUST DELETE THIS URGENT TASK (either by finishing it or re-writing it into the AF list as an Unfinished Task) BEFORE WORKING ON THE REST OF THE THREE TASKS.<br>D1e) Once you have at the most only one task left in the 3TS paper, repeat from step D1a.<br>D1f) At the end of the day, draw a line across the 3TS paper below the last item.  Start below this line the next day<br><br>D2. Comments<br>3TS is a very powerful tool for finishing tasks.  Combine it with the option to add just one URGENT Task into the system, and you have one very powerful AND flexible tool.  In fact, as I had said, I would be surprised if I come across another tool that is as powerful as this tweak in processing Urgent Tasks!<br><br>Now why just one Urgent Task? Well you can only do one urgent task at a time, right?<br><br>Another effect is the Kanban-like "pull" one can achieve with this 3TS version (although admittedly a weak one).  By closing the 3TS of the previous day, one can estimate the approximate volume of work one did for the whole day. It can be quite fun to actually try to exceed the number of tasks done the previous days.<br><br>So this covers the Core Parts.  Next post I will outline the consolidated instructions and comments on the synergy of the different parts.<br><br>God bless!</div>
