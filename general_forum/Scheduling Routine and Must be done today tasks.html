<div class="content">I've been considering doing both these things. Has anyone tried either one or both? How did it work for you?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jim<br>I love your handle!  I've been doing daily, weekly, monthly, seasonal and yearly checklists for years.  Although I plan by the week, I do create a daily MIT list daily and post it in the column next to my daily schedule.  When I can, I'll schedule timeboxes to knock out my current initiative (first thing) and my 1 -5 MIT's starting with the worst first.  In the evening, I MIGHT pull out my AF list.  My AF list is modified to capture only the things that aren't scheduled or on a checklist.  It's pleasurable to do if I have free time after dinner.  While I'm watching the news reports, I'll bang some out during reports that don't interest me.<br>This method of having the majority of my obligatory work routinized, makes it go quickly and failrly painlessly.  My creative work doesn't need any system.  Once it's truly habitualized there is no resistance unless I'm in pain.  Even then, most of it is doable in smaller units.  It goes fast because most of the decisions and procedures have been done long ago.  It's only a matter of doing it around the scheduled things or pushing it back a day or so if an irresistable opportunity arises.  This way my brain isn't beleagured with the mundane matters.<br>learning as I go<br></div>

<div class="content">p.s.  With projects, I both schedule them and also do them free form, which ever moves it along better.  Usually, I'll timebox the boring aspects to ensure they getting rolling in a timely manner and then I allow my creativity free rein.  If I'm on an incredible roll, I don't feel any trepidation to push back mundane stuff because it's always either current or ahead.  The checklist system keeps those things from interfering with my more passionate endeavors. I keep my project system separate from my automated system....yet I use my calendar to plan both the boring aspects and will intentionally get ahead on stuff to free up plenty of time so I can work without any nagging in my brain about more mundane stuff.  That's where the calendar, weekly planning and checklists prove to be golden!  If I'm willing to buck up, I can clear away several days if I want/need to.<br>learning as I go<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi, Jim<br>I just remembered something.......Mark's DIT system is very close to what I do except I do it in a weekly format coupled with the weekly goals I set out for myself.  Once you get used to working with the checklists, you begin to see how much of your work can be batched and knocked out quickly as opposed to deciding anew for each item.  His book is also replete with MANY WONDERFUL tips, procedures and ideas to get yourself to really take the time to think about what you're actually deciding/doing or not deciding/not doing.  It's truly a definitive productivity bible of sorts!  At the least, it's a "must have" book to keep on your bookshelf to  both guide you and to refresh your productivity purposes and intentions.  It's an excellent productivity roadmap!<br>learning as I go</div>
