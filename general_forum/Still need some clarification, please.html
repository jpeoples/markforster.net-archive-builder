<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-01-9 22:12</div>
<div class="content">I have to admit that I haven't started yet, but for me, this week wasn't a good one to do so. <br>This gave me the chance to read some additional discussions here before making the plunge. <br>However, I'm still uncertain about some of the instructions: <br><br>(1) When you first get to work on any page, or when you get back to work on your list for the first time that day, or when you get back to a page after working on another, you do a quick scan of this page *only*, right? <br>Some comments seemed to indicate that you should scan the whole list (of all pages). <br><br>(2) You only do *one* "slow scan" (working on all the items that 'stand out', in the order of appearance) of a page, then go to the next page (given that you have multiple pages), you don't return to the top of the same page immediately, am I right? <br>There are some contradictory remarks both in the instructions and on the website about that (esp. the instructions saying "5. Continue going round the same page in the same way.", and some forum post from you, Mark, that I can't find anymore that tells to resume scanning the page at the task after the one worked on, and switching to the next page after the end of the list). <br><br>(3) I'm *very* sceptical of the advice to add all the contents of backlogs to the system. In fact, my *huge* backlog is one of the major factors holding me back from starting. I don't really want to throw all this into this system. I'm afraid it would get bogged down from the start. In addition, adding all these items would take ages. Wouldn't it be a better idea to "draw a line" like in DIT (at least for items more than a week old, which means all the items from the old year or *cough* even older) and treating them as a separate backlog, preferably as the "current initiative", which seems to be a good idea that got lost in this new system?<br><br>I'm sorry if some of these issues have already been addressed and clarified in the forum discussion. I read many threads, but not all, and the search seems not to be completely up to date.<br><br>Even with these open questions in my mind, I'd like to send Mark a big thank-you for offering this system in public for free, and for all the work he is taking on in explaining and discussing it here. I've never seen anything like this happen! <br><br>Regards, <br>Alex</div>

<div class="content">Alex<br><br>I think the best thing you can do is to jump right in and start using the system!<br><br>You scan down the first page once. Then a second time more slowly until an item catches you eye that feels right to do now. Once you've done enough on that item cross it out. If it's not finished add it to the last page. Then scan the page again, I think Mark suggests from the next item after the one you've just crossed out. If nothing catches your eye then start again at the top of the page and continue down to the item just crossed out. If in those scans something catches your eye continue on that item as for the first item.<br><br>Do this repeatedly until nothing catches your eye. Then on to the next page.<br><br>Remember you only HAVE to do one thing on the page and ONLY for as long as feels right i.e. it can be the tiniest thing 'just get the file out', before you cross it out and add it again to the last page. This keeps to the little and often effect which helps reduce or remove resistance.<br><br>Read the other quick start instructions and don't worry too much about getting it exactly right straight away. It's more important to do it that do it perfectly.<br><br>As questions arise, try to figure out the answer but check with the forum when you need to.<br><br>And no, I wouldn't add all your backlogs. Add tasks as they occur and as you start processing your pages (start with just a few pages say) you will automatically start adding things to the bottom of the last item on the last page as things occur to you. Over time you can start feeding in backlog tasks as it feels right to do so.<br><br>I hope this helps and that I have interpreted everything correctly.<br><br>Good luck</div>

<div class="content">I would endorse what Hannah says - once you start with the system a lot of things will most likely just fall into place and eliminate a lot of your questions.  I too had a lot of backlog items,set up as current initiatives under DIT and would also say don't just add them all into the system to start with.  I began my lists with just a few items, added more as they came to mind, and once the system had started to work well for me, began adding my backlog items a few at a time.   I still have a couple of hundred backlog items which I expect to feed in gradulally over the next week or so.</div>

<div class="content">Oops, I apologise for the typos in my reply above! I usually preview my posts and replies but someone else was hovering behind me wanting to use the computer so I just created the post with no checks - it shows the value of proofreading!<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Alex:<br><br>Hannah and Christine have given good advice, but just to confirm here are the answers to your questions:<br><br>1) Correct: you read through the page you are starting only. However I recommend that you read through the entire list whenever you have been away from it for an extended period.<br><br>2) No, you continue going round the page from top to bottom until you have done a full pass from top to bottom without doing any items. Only then do you move onto the next page. N.B. You can't find that forum post because it doesn't exist!<br><br>3) If your backlog is really as big as you say it is then by all means deal with it as in DIT. But make sure that any re-entries or follow-ups of items in the backlog go into the main list.</div>

<div class="content">Can Mark (or someone else?) clarify the point that is in Mark's comment above:<br><br>"No, you continue going round the page from top to bottom until you have done a full pass from top to bottom without doing any items. Only then do you move onto the next page."<br><br>I must be misunderstanding things, but I thought that a "full pass" meant that you did at least a LITTLE on each item. If that was true, then it would be impossible for one to do a full pass "without doing any items."<br><br>Can someone explain what this" full pass" means?</div>

<div class="content">Steve:<br><br>No, you've got it wrong. A "full pass" just means looking at each item on the page in turn from top to bottom of the page. You may do some of the items or you may not - it's still a full pass.</div>

<div class="content">Yes Steve, you just action the item/s that stand out.  You only have to work on one item on the page. If no item stands out that is the point that the system is rejecting all remaining items on that page.</div>
