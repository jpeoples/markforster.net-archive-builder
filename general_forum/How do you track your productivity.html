<div class="content">Do you track your productivity both at home and work?  If both, do you use the same metric towards productivity?  I'm presently measuring both, and will probably use the same metric for each but am considering all of the options.</div>

<div class="content">I don't either...<br>I know it will sound like I'm full of myself but I believe productivity is an illusion.<br><br>I do have a kind of metric and it's the Pomodoro.<br>This said, may I ask: Why be Productive when you can be Effective?<br>Measuring effectiveness seems (to me at least) much healthier for the soul and the stress system...</div>

<div class="content">I find it hard to track as well.  Some days I get many tasks done, but they are of low value, other days I only do a few things, but they ring the register so they are more important.  so in essence, it is by feel.  Do I feel a particular day was productive.<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">I think we might be tripping over semantics a bit.  The way I measure my productivity is to work in timed, 30 minute blocks.  I see how many of these blocks I can complete in a day.  For a productivity or efficiency rating, I divide the number of hours of productivity by the number of hours worked.</div>

<div class="content">But that's a measure of endurance, not productivity.  Me if I work too hard at something I get tired and slow down.  I end up being less productive than otherwise.  See also the proverb about stopping to sharpen the saw.<br><br>I think all productivity measures are task specific.  If you are sharpening pencils you can count the sharp pencils.  Time is like boxes.  It contains activities.  It's not important how many boxes have stuff.  What's important is the amount of quality stuff you have at the end.</div>

<div class="content">I just measure whether I have got upto date with my incomings emails voicemails and paperwork. I use the Do It programme (3 desired Outcomes) and one evaluates progress on this daily. <br><br>I found timed bursts / pomodoros effective as a focusing tool yet a blunt instrument at times for any sort of measurement of productivity. One short telephone conversation could unlock a mojor project yet it might not even make it into a timed session.</div>

However even if all my activity is low value  - while using Mark's, or any system - there's some mindful aspect via tracking. Moreover, I do far, far less low value things (read: facebook) while tracking. <br><br>QuickLog syncs to Google Calendar, providing me with a weekly snapshot of where my DWM time went. I find that helpful (and motivating).</div>

<div class="content">I don't really track how much I'm getting done in any systematic way.  For me, it's pretty evident... am I making progress on my various projects?  Am I ready for class at the moment I find myself standing in the room in front of 30 half-asleep college students?  How many things are getting dismissed?  I did just start archiving my dismissed items (I use DWM) into their own folder on Toodledo (I have one for "active" and one for "dismissed") so that I have some sense of what's going over the Falls and can look for patterns therein should I want/ need to.<br><br>For a while, before I found AF, I used slife (<a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/productivity_tools/slife.html)" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/productivity_tools/slife.html)</a> but it was buggy as all get out at the time.  I might give it another go, actually, just for curiosity's sake.</div>

<div class="content">I used to work at the US Department of Labor in Seattle, mainly on projects to encourage a culture shift in state and local agencies towards quality, customer satisfaction and continuous learning.<br><br>I was the resident troublemaker and oddball thinker in an office full of very talented but fairly linear thinkers.<br><br>And some of them would wonder to my teammates if I actually did anything. Because most of the time it didn't look like I was sitting at my desk focusing.<br><br>And I'd wonder about it as well.<br><br>One day when I was feeling particularly guilty, and suspecting that I was wasting the taxpayers' money, I asked myself a very different question:<br><br>"If I hadn't been here the past six month, what would be different? What wouldn't be here"<br><br>It was long enough ago that I don't remember the details of what difference I'd made. But as soon as I saw it in that light, I started to think that I needed a raise. The value I added was quite dramatic, and when I look at my experience there I can say happily that Uncle Sam got a deal. <br><br>So these are my questions when I'm wondering if I'm being effective, productive or just slacking:<br><br>1. In the last six (three, twelve, two) months (days, weeks, years) where have I come and what has changed?<br>2. If I hadn't been here, what would be different and what wouldn't have happened.<br><br>The trick, of course, is learning to self-regulate how you work and live. Do you focus on what's meaningful? Are you happy and enjoying life? And do you have patterns and structures and rhythms that support you in being able to get stuff done easily. If you can answer a resounding 'Yes!' to all three, you're good. <br><br>And it's always a great exploration to elevate all three of these to the next level.<br><br>Great question you posted TK, really got me thinking, thank you!!!</div>

<div class="content">I conquer with Barak 100% and must add that this topic really inspired some great posts.<br><br>As for being too much in semantics...<br>I truly think that we are in an age of knowledge workers.<br>That means that our jobs are not as defined as they where.<br>Therefore defining if we where productive or effective is more difficult because we cannot foresee the effects as easily as say: "Planted crops so next harvest will be good!"<br>That's why Barak is on the money on looking BACK at what happened...<br><br>A few years back, people started to understand that there was a difference between being busy and being productive. Now the question of "is this productivity actually toward a meaningful goal?" raised it's head and all sorts of other concepts like Effectiveness and Efficiency got thrown in the mix.<br><br>I believe that being aware of those discrepancies in meaning and what you wish to focus on is quite important and not as well communicated as we might think. People talk in business of tactics when they are actually talking about strategies and vice-versa. And sometimes goals get thrown into the mix...<br><br>Heres a nice read about productivity and effectiveness:<br><a href="http://personalkanban.com/expert/am-i-productive-efficient-or-effective/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://personalkanban.com/expert/am-i-productive-efficient-or-effective/</a></div>

<div class="content">I like the question: If I hadn't been here for .... <br><br>I sometimes give my days a letter grade, like in school, but it's against how much progress I feel I made rather than an objective standard. If I'm sick and still manage to do the minimum daily work, that's an A. If I had a productive week and intentionally take Friday off, that's also an A. I also look at why I didn't give myself a good mark. Was I avoiding tackling a project? If so, should I work on other things or subdivide the project? Do I always skip the same task? I'm thinking of dividing days into smaller parts, say morning, afternoon, after-school and evening, to see patterns there.</div>

<div class="content">performance metrics for myself (and probably for other knowledge workers reading this) really don't make much sense But I do keep track of three metrics that calculate automatically from my DWM/AF spreadsheet. I like to look at these three on a daily basis.<br><br>#1 % complete-- Tasks on list complete/total list.<br>#2 net gain/lost-- Number of tasks added and not completed today-- if it is a negative number I am closing out more tasks than I am adding.<br>#3 "Real tasks" done. The number of really significant tasks (usually work projects) that I completed and did not reenter.<br><br>Again, these are really silly numbers in the grand scheme of things. But I do think playing against yesterday's score on each three metrics help to motivate me to stay on list.</div>

<div class="content">Metrics can help in the same way Seinfeld's "Don't Break the Chain" approach works. You pick a task that would benefit from daily work. In his case that was writing. Every day you work on it you put a dot on the calendar. Join dots on consecutive days into a chain. Eventually the urge to continue the chain helps keep you motivated.<br><br>We drive by a factory every few months. They have big signs showing accident-free days for both road and plant.

<div class="meta">2010-10-1 9:35</div>
<div class="content">@ Seraphim<br><br>Wow, this is a good question!<br>It had me thinking for about half an hour (which means it has a lot of value for me because it will be effective in furthering my understanding of myself and my system). But still, I'm writing this as I think so I hope you will excuse the lack of conciseness and the length of it. From the bat, I must say that I don't believe that there are "metrics" easily applicable but there are ways to ensure good effectiveness in what you do.<br><br>First, I think that effectiveness is directly related to value. If you gain a lot of value from one activity compared to another, then it is more effective for you. The problem is, the type of value is quite different from task to task and from person to person. But there is 2 built in processes in my system that assure that I do the things that have the most value.<br><br>One of those is that I limit. I simply limit the amount that I'm willing to do in a day. Let me give you an example and explain the concept. If I give you 10 different cakes (and let's assume you like cake) as choices for desert but you can only choose one. You will, without fail, take the one that will give you the most enjoyment.<br><br>On top of that, that value is compared with all the other things you didn't eat. So the idea that value is also derived from the comparison with another thing comes into play. Therefore I always have a couple of choices in my system to make me choose, hence derive value for each thing and pick the one that has the most and I can only do that. All of Mark's systems have this stamp too!<br><br>If you doubt the power of limiting yourself, try Twitter. It's a wonderful tool to learn to write concisely and with value. You only have 140 characters to send your thoughts or a message. So I usually start by typing what I want to say and then cut, rephrase, restructure and change the grammar of the text to fit snuggly in those limits.<br><br>Ex:<br>Everybody should go watch the A-Team movie; it's a "must see"!!!<br>it was so hilarious... I really laughed when the guy tries to jump-start the ambulance with the defibrillator!<br><br>Would become something like:<br>I found "The A-Team" movie hilarious; it's a Must-See...<br>Watch for the guy trying to jump-start an ambulance with a defibrillator!!!<br><br><br>By the way, my backlog too has a limit so if I want to put something in, I have to do something or throw something out! And if I only have 30 minutes for my emails this day, I will find the most effective way to do them quite fast.<br><br>Then, I have most activities divided into categories where I can not only know what type of mindset and energy I'm going to use but also which value I'm shooting for in those activities:<br>Rest/Relax: Did I spend time really focussing on the now.<br>Maintenance: Is all I committed to in the "important, not urgent" quadrant.<br>Projects/Learning: Have I got a real boost in creativity and fire to move forward.<br>Physical: Did I get a good workout for my condition.<br>Fun/Entertainment: Did I totally escaped reality for a while.<br><br>Since the categories are defined by values, they are their own determinators of Effectiveness. And since I always leave time to learn in my day, I often look at what I do and how to do it better.<br><br>But for this to work, you need to master having stuff on your list and not commit to it. This way, those things don't bug you and you commit only to the most valued things.<br><br>As for a "metric" for the system itself: since I manage my energies during the day, if I find that in this particular time of year, I do more creative things then budgeted, then I simply re-budget :)<br><br>P.S: Sorry for the long rant...</div>

<div class="content">Erik,<br><br>Thanks for the rant!  :-)   This stuff is really hard to measure.  Peter Drucker, who coined the term "knowledge worker", wrote many books on the topic of measuring productivity when there aren't any widgets to count.   <br><br>For example, see Drucker's book "Management in the 21st Century", or just google "drucker knowledge worker".<br><br>Drucker was the first to frame the question, but he didn't get very far in defining real metrics.  But I haven't seen anyone else get much farther than he did.<br><br><br>Lately, I've been trying to get myself to think in terms of "ROI" -- Return On Investment.   <br><br>The Investment is the effort invested, where "effort" is roughly equivalent to "blood, sweat, and tears".  <br><br>The Return is the positive impact -- am I getting the results I want?   It can also be a measure of leverage -- how much "blood, sweat, and tears" am I reducing for other people, or for myself later on.<br><br>I am finding it's easiest to figure out a metric when I am dealing with an ongoing activity, rather than a one-off task or project.   For example, I spend some time on "get out the vote" efforts, distributing candidate literature, etc.; and helping coordinate other volunteers.   I struggle with how to measure our effectiveness, and to decide where we should focus our effort.  <br><br>Then a friend recommended a book, Lawrence Grey's "How to Win a Local Election", which had the key insight that most activities can be translated directly into votes.  For example, a personal contact (door-to-door precinct work) generally translates into 1.5 votes -- you influence the person you contacted, plus some of their relatives and friends, minus a percentage of people who don't like your message.  Putting up a sign for a candidate might generate 2 votes.  But it can take 10 phone calls to get 1 vote.   <br><br>This means that my team and I are really a "vote factory".  Favorable votes are our widgets.   There are other important things we must also do -- like decide which candidates we want to support! -- but the purpose of all the precinct work, signs, and meetings is to generate those votes.  Otherwise it's just busywork.<br><br>This example has helped me think of ways to measure other things that I do on a regular basis -- any kind of maintenance activity or ongoing project.   The trick seems to be to define the desired outcome in measurable units.<br><br>The "SMART" goal method is similar on the surface -- "make sure your goals are Measurable".  But for me, this is a little different.   This process is more iterative, more agile, and less top-down than SMART.</div>

<div class="content">Wow some great ideas are emerging!  I agree with Erik that each kind of activity has a different kind of measure.<br><br>"Worked on a task 2 hours" is not a measure of productivity, though "Worked this week for 30 minutes" might be a clue why something isn't progressing.  "Completed 6 things" doesn't tell you much either.  Me, I'm starting to log "work completed".  Each task I finish I write in the log.  So I will have a list of accomplishments over time.<br><br>A Good Day? It's virtually impossible to classify each day as good or bad.  Some days are obvious, but... One day is too short to measure productivity. Sometimes you do much work but complete nothing.  You can compare one week to another, or one month to another.  It's not so much the quantity of things done, but rather a subjective impression of whether one week was better or worse than another.  Look at the collection of completed work, and the impact of that work, and decide whether it's good.<br><br>Task-Specific Success Measures.  For creative work, you could track the amount of time on a project, and grade the work ABCDF.  Or count money earned or people's responses.<br>For routine work, just measure how long it takes.  One week you clean the house top to bottom and it takes 4 hours.  Next week you clean bottom to top and it takes only 2 hours.</div>

<div class="content">Time spent works best for me. Not spending enough time on things (and the corollary of spending too much time on other things) is normally the reason I don't get things done. I tried tracking my focus so I could improve it, but it became another excuse. Rather than spend 30 minutes getting only 15 minutes done, I'd put it off until the (mythical) time I would be able to focus better.<br><br>AF is nice because it lets me do anything on the list rather than exactly what's scheduled. It lets me choose the task that best fits my focus and energy at the moment (or convinces me that no task is ideal for the moment, so I may as well roll the dice and pick one).</div>

<div class="content">I wonder if it's worth doing some sort of weekly / monthly retrospective that focuses on *completion*?<br><br>The *completion* might be tasks / projects / chunks of things that bring a feeling of achievement and satisfaction. <br><br>I say this because I believe many of us continue to drive forward incessantly, maybe feeling like we will never do, or be *enough*. <br><br>Surely there is value in taking stock and feeling good about what we *have* achieved?<br><br>I say 'we' and 'us' but I am really talking about myself here.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Erik, <br><br>An interesting approach. I suppose I may have experienced something similar when I tried the Pomodoro Technique. Meaning daily feedback on stuff completed. <br><br>I wonder if it would be effective to describe say, 1 - 5 year aims / goals in the back of a notebook? From the front of the notebook could be a daily / weekly / monthly retrospective of work completed. <br><br>Gradually it may be possible to see the gap closing between the retrospective reviews and the longer term aims / goals. <br><br>This in some ways is similar to Gerry's Do It methodology in that the emphasis is sort of on closing resources gaps whilst also generating self feedback on work completed.</div>

<div class="content">@Leon<br><br>The thing I find most sad about lists is this. All day, you go through your stuff and strike things out. It's a good feeling but something that doesn't last so you need to strike something else asap to feel engaged. And at the end of the day, you are left with... Emptiness!<br><br>You strike through your stuff and what's left is what you didn't do. So your focussing on the backlog. Now even if you write what you achieved as goals, it's not representative of the effort you put into it. So in essence you strike a bunch of tasks to earn the right to write one goal as accomplished. They are not even related.<br><br>You can't know the satisfaction of seeing a task going from "to do", transform into "doing" and finally get to "done" unless you actually try it. You don't rewrite it; it's just the same thing but it's nature changes. What your left at the end of the day is a WALL of stuff you've achieved!!! It's just amazing. Your effectively and literally "building" your day instead of "destroying" your backlog...<br><br>It's hard to explain but that's my view on it. That said I do believe that if you are to use lists, then yeah, definitely find a way to see what you accomplished and take that focus out of the "I haven't done this yet..." to the "Wow, look what I did today!"</div>

<div class="content">In line with Erik's comments, how about highlighting actioned items instead of crossing them?<br><br>Second idea: a journal that starts with goals, and daily records what progress you've made.  (also record plans you make to do even better?)<br><br>As for AF and DWM, the goal is to complete that first page. Take note of each page you finish as success.</div>

<div class="content">The evidence of a productive day for me is one that is balanced and a real treat is getting something off the backlog. If I fixate on getting one thing done, pushing way to much, I don't feel I had a good day, and the "problem" thing is still there the next day. <br><br>@Alan: your highlighting idea reminds me when I worked in a place that had a large chart on the wall of the week's worth work for our department. When the jobs were completed they were highlighted in blue rather than crossed off. When the whole week was filled with blue we all felt a sense of accomplishment. And if they weren't all done we scrambled to get the last few to blue.</div>

<div class="content">@Erik, thank you for your insightful comments, I'll check out your Sources website again soon.<br><br>Highlighting completed tasks sounds like a good idea. Maybe it's actually better to cross out the rejected / dismissed items. However it may then may be difficult to have them on review as such.<br><br>I suppose a potential disadvantage is that a highlighter will be needed more of the time? <br><br>Maybe a box and a tick would work, but not be as easy to spot?</div>

Often I feel at the end of a 14-hour day that I'm not really sure what I did all that time, though I'm exhausted and feel like I "got a lot done".   I can go back and look at my Completed Tasks in Outlook, and that gives me a rough idea.   But the real test for me is whether I can explain it to my wife when she asks why this or that project still isn't finished.  She's not very impressed by "little and often".  :-)    She (rightly!!) wants to see ***results that matter***.  <br><br>And so do I.<br><br>Hmm, I guess I finally need to watch Erik's videos.

<div class="content">I have  to provide a weekly report to my boss.  It usually includes issues I've struggled with (and therefore need assistance or top cover) as well as accomplishments.  <br><br>As I start with the previous report and delete completed items, I am starting with a list of outstanding tasks or problems which sets the stage for the next week.  Any changes get made in blue as the week goes on, so it show progress on items as well as new items either completed or identified.  (Identifying an issue is progress as well for me.)  The more blue, the better.  It is completely separate from my DWM list, but helps to keep me focused on items that are important.<br><br>So this report that seemed like a waste of time when I first started doing it, can be a motivator.  If I've been good about updating it daily and it doesn't show much progress, it motivates me to work harder and produce real progress during the remainder of the week.  When little is accomplished for the whole week, it serves as motivation for the following week.<br><br>While it doesn't  track productivity from a statistical standpoint, it does clearly show progress (or lack thereof when things hang around in the report without it). I'm forced to really look at whether an item hanging around is something that will get done or not and goes beyond the little and often that lets it remain on my DWM list.  I am overloaded, so there are always choices about what isn't going to get done.  Sometimes no good choices remain and my boss sees that about the same time I do.  That allows for him to provide assistance for those things he wants done because he can see what won't get done without it.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Erik -- Great video.  I watched the main "My System" video (58 minutes - <a href="http://www.eriklorrain.com/Sources/iVideoBlog/Entries/2010/7/20_My_System.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.eriklorrain.com/Sources/iVideoBlog/Entries/2010/7/20_My_System.html</a> ).   You have an incredible number of insights and creative ideas, all integrated into a beautiful whole.<br><br>It's also very clear that you are a teacher -- so many excellent illustrations, like the tree, with maintenance as the roots and project work producing the fruits.   <br><br>I really enjoyed it, and learned a lot!     I will definitely be trying to work many of these ideas into my own self-management.   Thanks very much!!</div>
