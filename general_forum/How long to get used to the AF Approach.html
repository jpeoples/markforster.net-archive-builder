<div class="content">Hi everyone,<br><br>I'm now on my third or fourth attempt with AF now - and I've managed about three days without freaking out about deadlined work and reverting back to the refuge of DIT. The other attempts generally lasted 1 - 3 days! I used DIT for well over a year successfully so I guess I'm having difficulty changing my mindset from DIT to AF. However I can see some real genius in AF so I really want to adapt this approach to Time Mangement. <br><br>I'd be interested to get feedback from others on how long it took generally to get into the flow of AF, particularly if using DIT previously and if there were any specific issues with AF that initially made them switch back to a previous system but then managed to resolve it.</div>

<div class="content">Leon, I can't speak to the switching systems, but I am wondering if you'd feel more comfortable keeping your deadline tasks on a separate list or identified somehow. As I'm using a digital list, all tasks with deadlines naturally appear at the top of each page. Fortunately, I haven't found that to create resistance to them. I can also look at a Focus list of all tasks due in the next two days. I naturally bounce back and forth between my Focus list and my regular AF list and it works. I have a habit of forgetting important things, so this back-up system for deadlines keeps me from feeling anxious.<br><br>Can you review your tasks each evening and identify any with deadlines in the next day or two? You could then keep these on an index card that you could use as a paper bookmark as Mark has discussed previously. <br><br>Just a thought...</div>

<div class="content">Leon,<br>I don't know if I'm going to be able to help with your question, but I can share my perspective, for what it's worth.<br><br>I’m in a similar position to you - I have used AF for a few spells, and was inspired!  I think there are some powerful concepts in the system which drive real breakthroughs in behaviour.  I would like to use it more.  But despite the exhortation throughout the forum to ‘trust the system’, I have struggled to do so in relation to timing-, energy- and duration-critical tasks.  Which, at work anyway, is most of my time.  I have come to the conclusion that to keep everything under control (including my stress!) I must view AF as something I do after my appointments, meetings, the same-day urgent tasks, yesterday’s intrays, and any essential work on outputs due imminently.  Which leaves only an hour or two each day, often in gaps too short to get into any kind of AF flow.  I can’t cycle through the pages as recommended each day, (and I don’t even have very many pages) and so I have to pick out anything due soon whatever page it’s on (common sense rule).  Maybe the ‘imminent deadlines’ work will reduce gradually if I work on things before they are urgent via AF, so the relative proportions of AF and non AF work may change.  But I think I do still need the overall structure for organising myself which is based on GTD with a dose of DIT (‘everything book’ for collecting stuff; project and deadlines list; calendar appointments and reminders; must-do-today list; agenda lists for people/meetings).  <br><br>I am using the AF principles for personal stuff more easily (my home system is separate from the work system).  Even though working on the AF list is something I do after I’ve done the essentials of the day, it’s feeling good and I’m enjoying working this way, making headway with things I’ve been stuck with for ages.  I think AF is a great approach to working with a to do list - but it doesn’t (for me) (and in fairness doesn’t claim to) provide a way of managing the whole of life’s commitments! <br><br>Anyway, good luck with whatever adaptation you come up with to get the best of all worlds!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Leon<br><br>I feel really fortunate to have "got" how the system worked almost instantly BUT that was because I had looked at similar (less structured) ideas so understood the concept.  If it hadn't been for that I am sure I would have had a lot of struggles with "trusting the system".  As someone for whom the system works amazingly that has not been pain free or without areas that are difficult to resolve, such as the speed of moving through the pages, worrying about things that I believe are important but are not standing out, limited discretionery time etc.  It sounds as if you are seeing the benefits of AF but finding it hard to let go of the security of what has worked in the past.  All I can say is try to hang on in there - if you need to hang on to parts of your old system whilst learning to trust AF fully then don't be afraid to do that - Mel offers some excellent suggestions above.  If you think of those tips as water wings whilst learning to swim then one day you just discover you don't need them any more.  <br><br>Good luck!<br></div>
