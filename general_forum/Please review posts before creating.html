<div class="content">WARNING TO ALL WHO ARE SENSATIVE TO TYPOS!<br>I have brain injuries. Reading compresension is easy yet....I have a horrible short-term memory glitch!  Therefore, reading is quite difficult for me.  OTOH, typing is almost as easy as thinking for me.  You can guess the conculsion to draw.....If you're sensative to typos, please ignore my posts.

<div class="content">Learning,<br><br>I've led a rough and tumble life and played contact sport have had several concussions throughout my life. Last year I was in a serious wreck and the cumulative damage over the years caused that final concussion to some significant lasting effects.<br><br>It was as if I had a stroke for a few days, then things came back slowly. About a year later, I do notice I drop words when typing more often and type words which sound or look similar to those I am trying to type. And that I am only smarter than the average person by 3.4 standard deviations. That last 0.1 was a significant loss.<br><br>If you are serious, remain hopeful and follow a decent diet and do not avoid those things which aggravate or demonstrate your "injuries". Rehabilitation can take some time and acceptance for that which cannot be rehabbed cannot be underestimated.<br><br>At least you didn't sign your moniker this time within your post, so that is progress. Cut the smileys and various textual signs of emoting and I am sure you will be right as rain soon enough. At least you won't injure my brain as much.<br><br>Also brain "injuries" can be helpful. Just after the concussion, I had to deal with some potential pain personal relationship stuff, but I simply didn't have the mental capacity to care a whole lot, so I was spared some probable useless waste of mental energy. Who knows? But having months of not being able to "care" (force my will more than useful on the world) taught me how continue that more effortless way of being afterward.<br><br>Best of luck!<br><br>p.s. AF was a God-send during this time.</div>

I have always had some dyslexia and that often shows (but mostly I catch it when writing).  I omit words and have problems with switching V and F when I type save/safe and the R key sometimes does not make a connection when I type.  Oh well, I don't produce a publication grade produce when I write a post to a discussion group ... big whoop.  Someone takes offense ... another big whoop.  Someone ELSE wants me to something ELSE the way he likes ... yet another ... well, you know.<br><br>Now do I need a "marm" to tell me I do these things?  No!  Do I want a "marm" to criticize me?

<div class="content">Hey Learning, not to worry, it was only a two letter word and the whole reason I missed it was that it is one of that class of words that seems to be dying out ... I'm guessing since ready quickly overlooks them.<br><br>You lost 30 IQ points!  Damn, you must have really had an extraordinary IQ before that! ;-)<br><br>Yes, we had a wonderful trip.  She did a "half century" ... 50 miles in one day.  She was trying for a "century" but overestimated her conditioning.  But she was jumping up and down in joy for meeting her revised goal.  That is one of the most wonderful parts of her personality ... if she can't meet a goal, she changes it to one she CAN meet then celebrates that.  I admire that ;-)<br><br>So we are back now with our kitties.  Poor Rory, though ... we locked Fitz (AKA Fitzdini)  in the hall closet so we could open the front door for a couple of minutes to load the car.  Once we were done, I opened the closet door to let Fitz out (having learned from the experience of locking him in a closet for hours) and Rory slipped in (that cat can dart so fast you can't see her move) and spent the day we were away locked in there.  It was my job to count noses (or in the alternative, count paws and divide by 4) before we left and I got distracted by some silly thing or other.  Damn good job we were not gone for more than a day.  (More details over on my list.)<br><br>The downside was that she was locked in ... the upside was that she had a quiet dark place to sleep with no chance of being chased by Fitz.  LOL ;-)  It is great that Rory is a cat that answers when called or I'd have been worried.</div>

<div class="content">Learning,<br><br>When I read one of your posts above, I was worried - really - that you'd decided to lobotomize your writing style. It seemed so neatly washed and brushed. Then I saw that you were just being considerate to Norman, because the post was addressed to him. Later posts showed healthy signs of returning to the full-on fusillade of exclamation marks, smileys, ROTFLMAO, *blush*es etc. <br><br>That's what previewing is for - to make sure you haven't left out any facet of your writing personality.<br><br>Let's be clear: the deadly advice to "Cut the smileys and various textual signs of emoting" came from nobody-likes-a-schoolmarm Norman.

I'm not writing for publication so I often don't proof my posts ... it is not that important to me.  Yet sometimes I reread a post and see an error that might cause confusion so at that point I'm motivated to correct it but can ONLY do so by posting another post to correct the post I previously posted.  <whew><br><br>Anyway, people do things I wish they would do differently all the time.

<div class="content">Yeah, I don't think I'll preview this post at all -- i'll just post it.  Personally, I don't take it kindly when someone tells me to preview my posts to avoid typos or to preview my posts "just to make sure I get my full personality in there," or whatever that qualifying statement was.  Maybe it smacks of the school-room as more than a few people have pointed out, or maybe it's latent authoritarian impulses finding expression, or maybe it's just snobbery. Or none of the above.  Could just be good-intentions, for all I know .  Sure as heck doesn't seem like the most harmful thing.   But in any event, it ain't my cup of tea. So I just want to stand up and say "None of that for me, thanks."</div>

But since prescription almost never works, this is becoming the prevalent understanding of it.<br><br>The second meaning you list is often labeled as "sarcasm". "Sarcasm" is a form of irony but especially directed to mean harm. Check the etymology. So sarcasm today is often simply irony: "The weather is (censored) wonderful today! <br><br>There are other forms of irony that are interesting, but rarely used outside of very specialized areas of research and and fancy writing.<br><br>For me, the best irony doesn't just mean the opposite of the explicit statement, but holds both seemingly contradictory statements in balance with humor. It shows the often supposed contradictory nature of life and celebrates it. It undoes the logician's impoverished view of the world.<br><br>An example:<br><br>Recently, had an increasingly heated discussion with someone I care about. Just before it might have become hurtful, I said:<br><br>God, I (censored) hate you.<br><br>In the context of the relationship and at that moment, this was seen as humorous, a statement of care and desire, and the truthful fact that she does really irk me at times to where I think of strangling her.<br><br>Some how those words found us out of the ridiculous argument we were having and into embrace. Explaining all what the statement is supposed to mean, would have hardly had the same effect, neither would have winking, or letting the cat out of the bag.<br><br>She asked me how much I hated her after we embraced: A whole (censored) lot. <br><br>She was delighted.<br><br>I am sure we all have had these moments. <br><br>I have a feeling she will ironically do what bothered me so much and caused the heated argument in the near future. And for some reason I doubt it will be as bothersome, in fact I might just find it endearing.<br><br>So irony of this manner has a healing effect. It helps you to learn to get over yourself and your simplistic, self-seeking stance on the world. She and I both now have a better humor about our difference (which will likely persist) without all the hullabaloo of tedious discussion and "working things" and compromising.<br><br>It is quite wonderful.</div>

<div class="content">From NY Times, <a href="http://papercuts.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/30/isnt-it-ironic-probably-not/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://papercuts.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/30/isnt-it-ironic-probably-not/</a><br>In “Reality Bites,” Winona Ryder, applying for a newspaper job, is stumped when asked to “define irony.” It’s a good question. Ryder replies, “Well, I can’t really define irony … but I know it when I see it.” Really?<br><br>Irony confuses. Let’s leave dramatic irony (you know, back when irony was tragic and the audience knew what was going to happen to Oedipus before he did) aside, as well as the debate over the supposed death of irony (after irony became comic, a subject that the Book Review’s former editor Chip McGrath amusingly chronicled here). Instead, let’s talk about how we talk — and write.<br><br>Irony requires an opposing meaning between what’s said and what’s intended. Sounds simple, but it’s not. A paradox, something that seems contradictory but may be true, is not an irony. The Times stylebook, which, believe me, can be harsh, offers useful advice:<br><br>The loose “use of irony and ironically, to mean an incongruous turn of events, is trite. Not every coincidence, curiosity, oddity and paradox is an irony, even loosely. And where irony does exist, sophisticated writing counts on the reader to recognize it.”<br><br>Alanis Morissette’s song “Ironic” is equally useful. If it rains on your wedding day, that’s a coincidence, not an irony. If you win the lottery and drop dead before claiming the money, it’s good luck followed by bad luck. If you meet the man of your dreams and then meet his beautiful wife, it’s a bummer. But if a song called “Ironic” contains no irony, is that in itself ironic? Nope.<br><br>It may just be … dumb. It depends on the creator’s intent. So, as has been suggested, if Morissette purposely wrote a song called “Ironic” that contained no irony at all, is that ironic? We may be getting closer. Do you know irony when you see it?<br><br>What’s something you’ve read — other than a novel by Jane Austen — that’s ironic?</div>

<div class="content">Outstanding presentation on irony:<a href="http://www.illuminos.com/mem/selectPapers/ironyFigLit.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.illuminos.com/mem/selectPapers/ironyFigLit.html</a><br>Literary and historical irony are intertwined. This was Marty’s address at the 75th anniversary meeting of the American Academy of Religion in 1984.<br><br> <br><br>Irony (fig.) and (lit.) in Modern American Religion<br><br><br>The dictionary names “an ironical speaker or writer” an ironist. D. C. Muecke (3-13) has named those who study irony “ironologists.” Paul Fussell (68) calls “irony hounds” those who pursue ironic outcomes in human affairs. While ironists keep on providing texts for the other two, it is ironologists in literary criticism and irony hounds in historical inquiry who coexist in religious studies today. Given the preoccupation with textuality in such studies, literary irony has received much attention. The writings of Muecke himself, along with those of Wayne C. Booth, J. A. K. Thompson, and the many scores of critics referred to in their bibliographies, are book-length elaborations of this literary trope.{1} Most modern literary critics in England and America, among them Cleanth Brooks, Erich Heller, and Kenneth Burke, have included such irony in their analyses, and it is common in works on religion and literature. Booth admits that he has been tempted to propose “a requiem for the terms ‘irony,’ ‘ironic,’ and ‘ironically,’ because of their overuse and misuse” (1983).<br><br>Meanwhile, the irony hounds have less frequently been busy at book-length work, and they have been less central in religious studies. Three books come to mind. Hayden White has been chiefly attentive to European historians in Metahistory: The Historical Imagination in Nineteenth-Century Europe. Richard Reinitz has written an American counterpart, Irony and Consciousness. The subtitle of that work includes the name of the religious figure who made irony a focus, Reinhold Niebuhr, in his The Irony of American History{2} Such works are less interested in tropes than perceptions of situations. The distinctions between the two sorts impel one to visit the Oxford English Dictionary (Oxford, 1933: s.v. “irony”) for definitions.<br><br>The irony of ironists, observed and dissected by ironologists, literary irony is “a figure of speech,” defined as one “in which the intended meaning is the opposite of that expressed by the words used; usually taking the form of sarcasm or ridicule in which laudatory expressions are used to imply condemnation or contempt.”<br><br>On the other hand, the irony of situations, observed and dissected by irony hounds, is not a figure of speech though the dictionary marks it “{fig.)” Instead, it is “a condition of affairs or events of a character opposite to what was, or might naturally be expected; a contradictory outcome of events as if in mockery of the promise and fitness of things.”<br><br>One additional element appears in almost all such ironic perception, an element that separates it from, among other things, “the irony of fate.” This is the responsibility of the human actor or agent. Gene Wise (1973 300) typically accents this ingredient: “An ironic situation occurs when the consequences of an act are diametrically opposed to the original intention, and the fundamental cause of the disparity lies in the actor himself, and his original purpose.” Observation of such actors by people gifted with nothing more than the hindsight that comes with later birth can lead to what Kenneth Burke (514) calls “romantic irony,” an aesthetic stance that would represent a standing outside of or in a posture superior to the roles of others. For reasons that will soon become clear, Richard Reinitz (19) has chosen to name the actor-centered version that is not bound to fate or given to detachment and superciliousness, “humane irony.” This version most deserves attention in religious studies when they focus on the human subject.<br><br><br>An Apology for Ironic Interpretation<br><br>When identification with or sympathy for the actor is neglected, and when the observer of irony therefore stands outside of or in a posture superior to the agent, cynicism about others' actions and passivity about one's own can result. It was because of this possibility, indeed, tendency, that Hayden White concluded the introduction to his 448-page masterwork on irony with his own requiem for irony:<br><br>It may not go unnoticed that this book is itself cast in an Ironic mode. But the Irony which informs it is a conscious one, and it therefore represents a turning of the Ironic consciousness against Irony itself. If it succeeds in establishing that the skepticism and pessimism of so much of contemporary historical thinking have their origins in an Ironic frame of mind, and that this frame of mind in turn is merely one of a number of possible postures that one may assume before the historical record, it will have provided some of the grounds for a rejection of Irony itself. (xii)<br><br>His claim that an ironic frame of mind informs much historical writing in modern times corrects an impression possibly left several paragraphs ago in the reference to but three sustained books on the subject. The list of historians cited by White and Reinitz serves as a reminder that anyone who comes on the scene isolating and advocating ironic perception and writing cannot do so with breathless announcements about fresh discoveries. Such makers of announcements would be quickly dismissed by ironologists and those in White's camp, for their great leaps forward in cultural lag, their obsolete au courantism. I am especially sensitive to this situation because I am publishing the first of a four-volume work on the twentieth century in the United States, Modern American Religion: The Irony of It All. Such a choice demands a rationale, of the sort that follows.<br><br>First, if a condition, situation, or outcome best admits of an ironic interpretation—over against, say, a tragic or comic or pathetic one—the conscientious historian will favor it, no matter what the fashion. Second, historians, of all people, should not resent but should welcome the observation that what they are doing is in a long tradition, that it has numbers of precedents. Tradition and precedent are their stock in trade. One does not, for example, stop writing about the sacred or the family or the frontier or tragedy because “it's been done.” Third, the recovery of figurative irony is part of the return to narrative in historical writing (Stone: 74-96). Thus fashion, old-fashion turned newest-fashion, also has its place. Figurative irony has to deal with the diachronic, with passages through time, since it concentrates on outcomes. Fourth, narrative needs a thread if it is dependent upon nothing more than a series of “and thens,” and ironic observation provides a plausible connector in certain circumstances.<br><br>To all this, I would add a fifth, one which acknowledges the influence of and participates in the recovery of an important element in the thought of Reinhold Niebuhr. This element provides a response to White. It belongs to the hermeneutical preunderstanding of numbers of us and, in my case, in respect to Modern American Religion, the understanding, the Verstandnis itself. The Irony of It All proposes this perception of outcomes as the most important thing I would like to say about the turn of the century—in this case, a period from 1893-1920—the time that more than any other is the matrix of modern conceptions of reality in America.<br><br>I would have no interest in seeing all interpreters of twentieth century American religion give themselves over to irony hounding.{3} If not all observers are to be preoccupied by ironic perception, one would hope that their outlook would be partly informed by it.<br><br>By now it should be obvious that both the ironic trope in literature and ironic perception in history appear to a large extent as choice. Samuel Hynes (41-42) correctly notices that irony represents “a view of life which recognizes that experience is open to multiple interpretations, of which no one is simply right, and that the co-existence of incongruities is part of the structure of existence.” That assumption poses two sets of issues: why the ironic outlook for a particular historian, and what does the choice of it say about his or her work; and why the ironic perception in respect to specific stories?<br><br>First, the historian. Once more, because White is the irony hound who would banish irony, he provides the best critical voice:<br><br>The late R. G. Collingwood was fond of saying that the kind of history one wrote, or the way one thought about history, was ultimately a function of the kind of man one was. But the reverse is also the case. Placed before the alternative visions that history's interpreters offer for our consideration, and without any apodictically provided theoretical grounds for preferring one over another, we are driven back to moral and aesthetic reasons for the choice of one vision over another as the more ‘realistic.’ (433-34)<br><br>On such terms White promoted, as alternatives, “the great poetic, scientific, and philosophical concerns” of the nineteenth century that were being eclipsed by the ironic in the twentieth century.<br><br><br>The Issue of Bias In Religious Studies<br><br>“Irony, like beauty,” writes D. C. Muecke, “is in the eye of the beholder and is not a quality inherent in any remark, event, or situation”(14). In the case of American religious concerns, the moral and the aesthetic are uncommonly interconnected, but here is it fair to accent the former: what is the moral concept of the ironic beholder and, by indirection, what is the moral vision of the beheld, the actors in this kind of historical narrative?<br><br>Such questions are urgent in religious studies because behind the quiet words “ironic perception” or “ironic outlook” looms the more portentous notion that a philosophy of history is somehow at stake. Especially when one cites Reinhold Niebuhr, such a philosophy is redolent of theological concerns, which, covertly or overtly, might introduce the value-laden into such studies. Overtly, it might be said in the Niebuhrian case, since that theologian argued that “the Christian faith tends to make the ironic view of human evil in history the normative one.” On these terms, he irony-hounded American culture to engage in critiques, to notice that “everything that is related in terms of a simple rational coherence with the ideals of a culture or a nation will prove in the end to be a simple justification of its most cherished values” (150, 155).<br><br>This is not the place to settle the issue of value-freeness in religious studies or historical inquiry; suffice it to say that in the latter area the notion of utterly value-free history has few defenders today. More positively, one might allow for the possibility that the hint of a biblical or specifically Christian outlook on history might help bring into bold profile the fact that positivist, progressivist, Marxist, or other outlooks also transcend “simple rational coherence” and are also philosophies of history that belong to the hermeneutical Vorverstdndnis of scholars who hold them. And,more neutrally, it is to be noticed that already in Niebuhr's prime, agnostics like Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. and Hans Morgenthau helped form an informal club of “atheists for Niebuhr” (Bingham: 360), who did not share his theological normativity in order to acquire his ironic stance. Nor, for that matter, did Reinitz (90-104), who emphatically did not share Niebuhr's religious faith or theology, yet who advocated his insight into irony.<br><br><br>Humane Irony: Illusion and Aspiration<br><br>What led Reinitz to name the Niebuhrian form “humane irony,” and what leads me to see in it a corrective to the “skepticism and pessimism” that led White to want to dismiss the ironic mode, was condensed in a sentence that clearly set forth the Niebuhrian dialectic. It is well known that his favorite biblical verse referring to divine transcendence as a background to irony was Psalm 2:4, referring to the illusions of pride among the earth's agents: “He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision.” What kept Niebuhr from using such a reminder to induce skepticism and pessimism, not to say detachment from and superciliousness toward the human agents, was the corollary to this claim, in the important urging that this God was “a divine judge who laughs at human pretensions without being hostile to human aspirations” (155; emphasis mine). The secular advocates of humane irony are humanists of the sort who honor human aspiration and endeavor.<br><br>The eye of the ironic beholder focuses first and always on the illusions, especially those of innocence, virtue, wisdom, and power, that help lead to the “contradictory outcome of events” (Reinitz: 178). Humane irony does not degenerate into a sneer whose only message is, “What fools these mortals be!” Humane irony, whether theologically motivated or not, always has to be marked by empathy on the part of the scholar for the people who are victims of powerful historical actors and agents as well as for those actors and agents themselves. The Niebuhrian passage on this is classic:<br><br>The knowledge of [irony] depends upon an observer who is not so hostile to the victim of irony as to deny the element of virtue which must constitute a part of the ironic situation; nor yet so sympathetic as to discount the weakness, the vanity and pretension which constitutes another element. (153)<br><br>Niebuhr elsewhere sees situations to admit of ironic interpretation if “virtue becomes vice through some hidden defect in the virtue” (viii), but this would not permit overlooking the virtue. Similarly, this is the case “if wisdom becomes folly because it does not know its limits,” but the wisdom is also to be observed. To the extent that historians or other interpreters retain some sympathy for people who act, who must act, in history, they are likely to be more faithful to the human subject, less prone to identify with a quasi-divine viewpoint that would make them victims of illusions that would lead to ironic outcomes on a grand scale. Should someone feel that employment of this perspective must lead to the passivity, apathy, even anti-activism that White and others have feared as a corollary to ironic interpretation, the hyperactive, energetic, pro-activist career of Reinhold Niebuhr in the human polis must be an impressive contradictory example.<br><br><br>The Issue of Exceptionalism<br><br>When humane irony is to be employed in specific cases, the parallel issue remains: why these cases? Just as too expansive definitions of “religion” dissipate the value of that word—if everything is religious, nothing is religious, it is said—then too expansive uses of “irony” dissipate the value of that outlook: if everything is ironic, then nothing is irony, in any useful sense. From transcendent and common sense angles alike, of course, all human history is ironic. Outcomes usually contradict “the promise and fitness of things.” One uses restraint, then, in applying it to cases. The issue of what historians call “exceptionalism” comes to the fore.<br><br>Normally, one would be restrained in the turning of an ironist's eye on the poor or oppressed of the world, even or especially in the rare cases when good things happen, to contradict what might have been expected to happen, as in the case of their victory in a revolution when the odds were in favor of their defeat. Of course, the poor and oppressed are capable of living with illusions, but these are not of the sort that usually evoke ironic interpretation. On those terms, the vast majority of pages devoted to social history would have little reason to display irony. One would not readily apply it to victims of the Irish potato famines or of religious persecutions in Europe. The generous natural, human, and political resources of America, on the other hand, have been more rich in developing illusion thanks to “the promise and fitness of things” that seem to be inherent in its situations.<br><br>Religion, the present subject, intensifies the potential for illusions. Religion in America, of course, admits ironic interpretation before any elements of “the modern” are plausibly to be discerned. Reinitz singles out and successfully makes the case for irony in Francis Parkman, Richard Hildreth, Henry Adams, down to Carl Becker in respect to those longer American pasts, and especially shows how Richard Hofstadter's ironist eye informed his writing on earlier periods (III, 2, 3; V, 2). Thus the American Puritans, as Perry Miller constantly observed (Wise, 1968), in respect to their aspirations and illusions relating to their covenant and their chosenness have been ripe subjects. Similarly, in the national period, as the concept of the covenant and chosenness were enlarged into the notion of the Redeemer Nation (Tuveson), many occasions credibly call forth and even demand the ironic vision. Both South and North in the Civil War lived with illusions of innocence, virtue, wisdom, and power. There are, most scholars admit, more reasons to discern tragedy than irony in the South, though C. Vann Woodward (209-10) also employs and observes irony there, and irony marks much of the North's contradictory outcomes. Given this background, it would be vain to speak of the unique validity of irony in the modern unfolding. But the exceptionalist is content with distinctives as opposed to uniqueness, and distinctive reasons abound. The age almost universally spoken of as liberal, progressive, and modern provided a stage full of actors for whom religion was the intensifier of illusions, and the way they lived with those illusions and the outcomes of their ventures set the matrix for later twentieth-century events. Thus whenever “modernisms” in theology are reasserted, as they were in the mid-twenties and mid-sixties, one sees in the denial of “the promise and fitness of things,” as perceived by the agents who propound modernisms, something that extends an element first discernible around the turn of the century. Similarly, whenever “fundamentalisms” in reaction to the modern find aggressive restatement, as they did in the mid-twenties and mid-eighties, one is prepared to see the beginnings of new ironic outcomes to match their illusions. Yet there is no reason to dismiss out of hand the plausibility and human aspiration in many endeavors of both camps.<br><br><br>The Eyes of the Beholders<br><br>Four sets of eyes are involved with the exceptional stories of modern American religion. The first two belong to people with the advantages of longer hindsight, who have the better perspective on outcomes and the distance that makes sympathy for intentions more difficult: the historians and their readers who come on the scene long after. The other two sets of eyes belong to people who have had less time and, because of their own involvement with illusions, less motivation to gain perspective on outcomes: the actors themselves. Yet even in their brief years, enough of them gave evidence of ironic awareness to legitimate a chronicling of these. To take a vivid example from modernist camps, the Social Gospel progressives, it is well known, had to deal with the trauma of World War I and the frustration of Wilsonian idealism as almost instant contradictions to the promise and fitness of things—and they as actors, and their original purposes, had been part of “the fundamental cause of the disparity” between intention and outcome. Their antagonists, who became the parties of Fundamentalism, in their intention to come up with a single, verifiable, authoritative orthodoxy, ironically observed themselves fighting with each other over a wild pluralism of anti-modernist options, many of them self-contradictory even if all based on a Bible now called inerrant, interpreted by Common Sense Realist rationalists.<br><br><br>Rhetorical Criticism and History<br><br>In order to track the interpretations of the actors who saw ironic outcomes on their own, or the other possessors of eyes among their contemporaries, their enemies, one develops particular genres of historical writing. For example, the illusions of the American poor and oppressed, the followership in religion, are less the subject than are those who give voice to and sustain the illusions and are agents of acts based upon them. This means that one must hear the voice and read the evidences. What results is what I would call “rhetorical history,” or history of rhetoric, which lies between more pure intellectual history on the one hand and deliciously impure social history on the other.<br><br>Paul Crawford provides some guidelines for such rhetorical history, history written by the critics who first “must so absorb the realities of conflict and the climate of opinion and audience attitudes of the time under consideration” that they can mentally place themselves in the past under study, yet must not pretend to divorce themselves “from the advantages that recent scholarship has given to hindsight” (102-3). The actors in this story did not wake up one morning in 1893 and decide to be subjects of ironic interpretation. Historians must remember that as much as they are alert to outcomes.<br><br>Second, critics must try to identify and distinguish ideas and attitudes of rank-and-file members of a movement and the views of its leaders, “particularly as embodied in their private expressions or in remarks to relatively sophisticated hearers who may not be typical of ordinary members” (ibid.). In these transactions, the occasions rich in ironic potential are given nuanced expression. The accent is likely to remain on the rhetoric of the leader and one must deduce from it something of what the followers heard or read. Thus if a Milwaukee priest and journalist can, over a period of years, fill halls and parks with Polish Catholics who agitate for Polish bishops for Polish people, one need not follow home all members of the audience to search for their probably never-existing diaries or likely lost letters in order to learn something of these peoples' expectations.<br><br>In respect to method, third, there must be attentiveness to the written or oral discourse and other forms of symbolic behavior, since many of the actors' intentions and expectations come in a complex of communicative modes. Finally, especially when studying the subject of religion, which can be epiphenomenal in a pluralist culture, the rank and file members and leaders may have only been identified with one or two phases or aspects of a movement for brief periods of time. These four observations are not a complete methodological prescript, but they do remind that rhetorical history, like rhetorical criticism in the literary world, follows some broad sets of rules.<br><br><br>Modernist and Anti-Modernist Extremes as Cases<br><br>This is not the place to detail as a case study the five sets of actors who crowd my stage at the turn of the century, the matrix of Modern American Religion. Suffice it to say, by way of illustration, that the world view of the theological modernists, who saw themselves as cosmopolitan or universalizing propounders of a progressive religion on the lines of a single rational and scientific model, turn out today to sound more dated and less accessible to most readers than do or would agents of Hassidic Judaism, Asokan-era Buddhism, or primitive or medieval Christianity. The British social philosopher Ernest Gellner spoke to this ironic situation: “As the Christians have found, the modernism of one generation is doubly dated in the next” (123).<br><br>Yet these modernists, as people of conscience and responsibility, had to act, and their intention to make the faith come out with what they saw to be a humane and in any case inevitably progressive unfolding of history, was marked by a spirit that can easily evoke admiration. Similarly, their enemies, who came to be called fundamentalists, who formed their party not as simple old conservatism but in reaction to modernism, can be seen to have had responsible intentions before the outcomes of their agency contradicted the promise and fitness of things. The fundamentalists were able to show that modernists were failing with their apologies, most notably among the secular intellectuals at whom they were aimed; and the modernists could quote fundamentalists not finding the unitive orthodoxy that seemed so obvious to them, but instead engaging in internecine warfare and sectarian battles. Thus one kind of premillennialist said of another that it was bannered as inclusive primitive Christianity, yet it “had nothing new in it that is true and nothing true in it that is new.”{4 } And while each camp made the claim that its orthodoxy of fundamentals was manifestly the right interpretation of the Bible, one reactionary could ask another, in lines that suggest an awareness of irony, “Do you think it wise to exalt into a 'test of fellowship' a doctrine so recently enunciated, that does not have a single passage of Scripture beyond the question of a doubt upon which to rest its feet?”<br><br><br>Three Other Case Studies Anticipated<br><br>The three other sets of actors include the literary and philosophical “moderns,” leaders of religiously bonded ethnic groups and denominations, and discerners of the negative effects of modernity who invented modern therapies (the ecumenical movement, the Social Gospel, and imperial civil or public religion). Ironically, the first of these, who ordinarily saw themselves, and were seen as, secular, turned out to devise religious or quasi-religious alternatives to the religion they would displace. Ironically, the leaders of the groups devised means to distance their members from confusing and beguiling elements in the surrounding pluralist culture, only to see that participants in the groups came in any case to find conflict between parties within them to be more urgent and satisfying than with parties around them. Ironically, discerners of differentiation, in their interest in promoting “wholeness,” the organic the restitutio ad integrum of which William James spoke, succeeded chiefly in being dismissed as adding to the competition of claimants to loyalty, and for being modernists who did not find their way back to the integrum at all. One should also add a grand “ironically” in respect to the already-referred-to reactionaries: ironically, it was precisely in the period that historians almost universally mark as modern, liberal, and, progressive that all the enduring twentieth-century intransigencies and conservatisms were born. Here we might cite Conservative Judaism and organized Orthodox Judaism, unyielding Eastern Orthodox Christian traditionalisms, anti-modernist Roman Catholicism that would dominate until Vatican II (1962-65), many forms of black Protestant conservatism, and the panoply of Protestant options including fundamentalism, reactionary evangelism pentecostalism, premillennialism, and the like.<br><br>The several allusions and quotations in the brief illustrative portion of this case study are not germane to the theoretical material here; references to these will be provided in the long narrative chapters in Marty, 1986.<br><br>These five sets of actors, here so cryptically referred to, become the subjects of a narrative hundreds of pages long. The narrative is the place to test the case study, but the framework of the narrative, the hermeneutical preunderstanding, has, I believe, broader promise for religious studies in general. The ironic interpretation of religion may have a quiet contribution to make to modern politics, when religion is so often the bonding agent in aggressive, national, ethnic, and cultural aggressive movements.<br><br><br>Humanities And Humane Irony<br><br>I cannot resist the suggestion as well that while not all humanities studies must be humanistic—some structuralisms and formalisms, it is often suggested, are not, even in intention—so they need and will not always be humane, as in the sense and case of “humane irony.” Yet, since historians remain in the humanities, and ply their trade in the company of scholars in religious studies, and since they will, in this reading, willy nilly bring presuppositions and assumptions to their narratives, it is valid to project some consequences of the particular ones they bring.<br><br>Insofar as their inquiries, teaching, and writing have a bearing on a the outlooks of colleagues, students, and readers, it is valid to ask whether the weariness of ironologists about the concept of irony itself, or the wariness of irony hounds like Hayden White, should preempt the space that might be given to the Niebuhrian irony that Reinitz calls “humane.” One need not bias religious studies by working out of the background of a belief in a God who is perceived as “not hostile to human aspirations.” On purely humanistic grounds, one can promote sympathy for such aspirations; indeed, many humanists would keep religion at a distance precisely because it does not always promote such sympathies through its accent on the transcendent.<br><br>As a consequence, Hayden White's contention that “irony tends to dissolve all belief in the possibility of positive political actions” because it a tends to a view of “the essential folly or absurdity of the human condition” (434) can be countered. The folly and absurdity may be essential to that condition, but they are not, at least not for all irony hounds, the essentials of that condition.<br><br>___________________________<br><br>This article is based on a Scholars Press Associates Lecture at the American Academy of Religion, December 9, 1984, in Chicago.

See the references to White, Reinitz, and Niebuhr in the bibliography that follows.<br><br>3. I shall be treating these ironic outcomes in respect to the modern as a projection into later times, while turning to the conflictual in respect to religion and then to the pluralistic in respect to America in later volumes covering 1920-52 and 1952-1973/74; that leaves who-knows-what for 1974-.

<div class="content">Irony article from The Guardian:  <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2003/jun/28/weekend7.weekend2/print" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2003/jun/28/weekend7.weekend2/print</a><br>The final irony<br>'Isn't it ironic?' You hear it all the time - and, most of the time, actually no, it isn't. Hypocritical, cynical, lazy, coincidental, more likely. But what is irony and why did pundits think it would die two years ago, after September 11? Zoe Williams meticulously, sincerely, unironically, hunts it down<br>The Guardian,	 Saturday 28 June 2003<br> larger | smaller<br>Taking its name from the Greek eironeia (dissimulation), irony consists of purporting a meaning of an utterance or a situation that is different, often opposite, to the literal one. <br>Maike Oergel, Encyclopaedia Of German Literature<br>Irony is a state of affairs or an event that seems deliberately contrary to what one expects and is often amusing as a result. <br>The New Oxford English Dictionary<br><br>Pretty much everything is ironic these days. Irony is used as a synonym for cool, for cynicism, for detachment, for intelligence; it's cited as the end of civilisation, as well as its salvation. Pretty much every form of culture claims to be shot through with it, even (especially) the ones that conspicuously aren't. I read last week that Bruce Forsyth hosting Have I Got News For You was an "ironic statement", as if you could ascend into irony just by being old, as you used to with wisdom. I read, too, that it was ironic for Alan Millburn to leave his job to spend more time with his family, when the doctors and nurses under his care don't have that facility; well, it's not ironic, it's just standard-issue self-interest, with maybe a smattering of hypocrisy. I've read claims of an "ironic" interest in Big Brother - nope. Lazy, maybe. Possibly postmodern. Not ironic.<br><br>We have a grave problem with this word (well, in fact, it's not really grave - but I'm not being ironic when I call it that, I'm being hyperbolic. Though often the two amount to the same thing. But not always). Just looking at the definitions, the confusion is understandable - in the first instance, rhetorical irony expands to cover any disjunction at all between language and meaning, with a couple of key exceptions (allegory also entails a disconnection between sign and meaning, but obviously isn't synonymous with irony; and lying, clearly, leaves that gap, but relies for its efficacy on an ignorant audience, where irony relies on a knowing one). Still, even with the riders, it's quite an umbrella, no?<br><br>In the second instance, situational irony (also known as cosmic irony) occurs when it seems that "God or fate is manipulating events so as to inspire false hopes, which are inevitably dashed"(1). While this looks like the more straightforward usage, it opens the door to confusion between irony, bad luck and inconvenience.<br><br>Most pressingly, though, there are a number of misconceptions about irony that are peculiar to recent times. The first is that September 11 spelled the end of irony. The second is that the end of irony would be the one good thing to come out of September 11. The third is that irony characterises our age to a greater degree than it has done any other. The fourth is that Americans can't do irony, and we can. The fifth is that the Germans can't do irony, either (and we still can). The sixth is that irony and cynicism are interchangeable. The seventh is that it's a mistake to attempt irony in emails and text messages, even while irony characterises our age, and so do emails. And the eighth is that "post-ironic" is an acceptable term - it is very modish to use this, as if to suggest one of three things: i) that irony has ended; ii) that postmodernism and irony are interchangeable, and can be conflated into one handy word; or iii) that we are more ironic than we used to be, and therefore need to add a prefix suggesting even greater ironic distance than irony on its own can supply. None of these things is true.<br><br>Now, after all that effort numbering and sub-numbering the points, I'm going to deal with them in the wrong order. That isn't ironic, it's just a bit sloppy. There are four important epochs of irony (unless you count Hegel, Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, but to do that, I would need to have read them).<br><br>Phase one Socratic irony is simply part of a canon of rhetorical tools devised to distract people from the fact that they've been sitting still listening to hard talk for an awfully long time. The technique, demonstrated in the Platonic dialogues, was to pretend ignorance and, more sneakily, to feign credence in your opponent's power of thought, in order to tie him in knots. This is amazingly prevalent in contemporary social intercourse - every one of us, I'd guess, has a friend who engages in an argument, waits patiently until you've said something really trenchant and probably wrong, then cocks his (or her) head to one side and says, "Do you think that's true?" thereafter pursuing each one of your most ridiculous points and challenging them from a perspective of utter (pretended) ignorance. Weirdly, this is never called irony, even though every other bloody thing that anyone ever says is.<br><br>Phase two Romantic irony was framed by Schlegel(2) the German philosopher. Here, it became a much more complex philosophical tool, of which the nuts and bolts were that you simultaneously occupied two opposite positions (what you say versus what is real). There were problems with this as a direct path to truth later on, but I'd need a more Socratic grasp of how not to be boring before I could go into them. The point with Schlegel was that irony would give you a divided self, which in turn gives you a multiplicity of perspectives, which is the only way you will unlock the truth of the whole. This romantic (or "philosophical") irony had a great influence on the English Romantic poets - Coleridge's Rime Of The Ancient Mariner, with its commentary running alongside the narrative, divides the perspective (plus, he read Schlegel, so I'm not just making that up).<br><br>But irony as part of the British literary tradition doesn't, generally speaking, commence with Romantic irony, but rather with the device that has its roots in Socrates, viz, saying the opposite of what is true in order to underline the truth. So, from this you'd trace a line from Chaucer, through More, Sidney and Milton, arriving at Swift and Austen, where you can see a pleasing bifurcation of irony's literary use. Austen uses irony as a means of being understated. Swift, by contrast, uses irony for polemical purposes, conjuring grotesque images ironically (babies being eaten, mankind enslaved to the morally superior horse) in order to state his case (that the Irish were starving, that humanity was going to the dogs) ever more forcefully.<br><br>Phase three Irony as a tool of dissent, a grim but failsafe gag and mainstay of popular culture, took hold during the first world war(3). The gross disjunction between patriotic rhetoric and the reality of the war itself led to a widespread use of irony as a means of puncturing deceitful propaganda. Every convention of today's ironic, satirical news forms (from Private Eye, through Viz, to the Onion) has a germ in the Wipers Times, the first world war trench newspaper (established, independently of military authority, by Captain FJ Roberts of the Sherwood Foresters.) At this point, irony was still purporting to be an overview - to be wading through the mulch of accepted wisdom and exposing its fraudulence. So, for instance, the Wipers Times would print a list of Things That Were Definitely True, and it would contain a proportion of propaganda ("40,000 Huns have Surrendered"), a proportion of enemy propaganda ("The Germans Have Plentiful and Tasty Meats") and a proportion of nonsense ("Horatio Bottomley has accepted the Turkish Throne on condition they make a separate peace"), thus undermining any information coming from anywhere at all (it's interesting that the paper was caustically ironic on the subject of the war itself, but never deviated from the line that home leave was a blessed relief, when, in fact, most soldiers found it stressful and devastating to return to normality after the trenches - there is a limit to how far you can take irony before you have to shoot yourself).<br><br>Where irony springs up as a response to being lied to (by authority, or prevailing culture, or whatever), it is still adhering loosely to Chaucer's model - it states the lie in order to expose the lie, and is therefore a route to truth. It has some moral import. It may say "This belief is wrong", but it doesn't say "All belief is wrong". When people call ours the Age of Irony, that is not the kind of irony they are on about.<br><br>Phase four Our age has not so much redefined irony, as focused on just one of its aspects. Irony has been manipulated to echo postmodernism. The postmodern, in art, architecture, literature, film, all that, is exclusively self-referential - its core implication is that art is used up, so it constantly recycles and quotes itself. Its entirely self-conscious stance precludes sincerity, sentiment, emoting of any kind, and thus has to rule out the existence of ultimate truth or moral certainty. Irony, in this context, is not there to lance a boil of duplicity, but rather to undermine sincerity altogether, to beggar the mere possibility of a meaningful moral position. In this sense it is, indeed, indivisible from cynicism. This isn't to say that "truth-seeking" irony has evaporated - many creative forms still use irony to highlight the sheer, grinding horror of pursuits or points of view that are considered "normal" (like The Office, for instance; and much of American literature is masterfully good at employing irony with a purpose - to choose at random, Pastoralia, by George Saunders, Infinite Jest, by David Foster Wallace, anything by Philip Roth, The Corrections, by Jonathan Franzen).<br><br>But other strands of media use irony to assert their right to have no position whatsoever. So, you take a cover of FHM, with tits on the front - and it's ironic because it appears to be saying "women are objects", yet of course it isn't saying that, because we're in a postfeminist age. But nor is it saying "women aren't objects", because that would be dated, over-sincere, mawkish even. So, it's effectively saying "women are neither objects, nor non-objects - and here are some tits!" Scary Movie 2, Dumb And Dumberer, posh women who go to pole-dancing classes, people who set the video for Big Brother Live, people who have Eurovision Song Contest evenings, Char lie's Angels (the film, not the TV series) and about a million other things besides, are all using this ludic trope - "I'm not saying what you think I'm saying, but I'm not saying its opposite, either. In fact, I'm not saying anything at all. But I get to keep the tits." As Paul de Man pointed out, some time before FHM, "This does not, however, make it into an authentic language, for to know inauthenticity is not the same as being authentic."(4). So, we're not the first age to use irony (as some insist), but we are the first to use it in this vacuous, agenda-free and often highly amusing way.<br><br>September 11 and the End of Irony<br><br>Politicians especially (but serious minds of all sorts) dislike this newish twist of irony, since political rhetoric relies on moral framework - they may be spinning, they may be sexing up their evidence, they may be lying straight to our faces as we beseech them not to kill innocent Iraqis for no good reason (as an example), but at least old-fashioned protest waits until it knows it has been lied to before it unleashes its irony. Modern irony ridicules politicians regardless, for their sheer unironic-ness in holding a position in the first place.<br><br>So, upon the giant disaster, many people were glad to declare irony's end. Gerry Howard, editorial director of Broadway Books, said, "I think somebody should do a marker that says irony died on 9-11-01." Roger Rosenblatt claimed, in an essay in Time magazine, that "one good thing could come from this horror: it could spell the end of the age of irony"(5).<br><br>This is striking as the kind of American self-importance that leads people to think they have no sense of irony in the first place. But there is legitimacy in the claim - for a very short time, the event seemed so earth-shattering that there did seem to be an absolute and clear dichotomy between good and evil. Once you've got one of those, then a) the act of seeking the truth through irony is pointless, because the truth is staring you in the face; and b) the postmodern ironic distance that eschews concepts like "good" and "evil" has been trounced. Naturally, irony was back within a few days, not least because of the myriad ironies contained within the attack itself (America having funded al-Qaida is ironic; America raining bombs and peanut butter on Afghanistan is ironic). But even without those ironic features, irony would have resurfaced pretty soon - only a very fresh tragedy can silence it.<br><br>The end of irony would be a disaster for the world - bad things will always occur, and those at fault will always attempt to cover them up with emotional and overblown language. If their opponents have to emote back at them, you're basically looking at a battle of wills, and the winner will be the person who can beat their breast the hardest without getting embarrassed. Irony allows you to launch a challenge without being dragged into this orbit of self-regarding sentiment that you get from Tony Blair, say, when he talks about "fighting for what's right". Irony can deflate a windbag in the way that very little else can.<br><br>What people usually mean when they yearn for an end to irony is an end to postmodernism. I'm not sure this will ever happen, since it places itself after originality and progress (what comes after the afters? Well, cheese, I guess).<br><br>Irony and America<br><br>There are a few reasons why we think the Americans have no sense of irony. First, theirs is rather an optimistic culture, full of love of country and dewy-eyed self-belief and all the things that Europe's lost going through the war spindryer for the thousandth time. This is all faith-based - faith in God, faith in the goodness of humanity, etc - and irony can never coexist with faith, since the mere act of questioning causes the faith fairy to disappear. Second, they have a very giving register that, with a sense of irony, would be unsustainable (how can you wish a stranger a nice day with a straight face?). Third, because we think Canadian Alanis Morissette is American, and she proved some time ago, with her song Ironic, that she didn't know what irony meant (this is so ironic - first, because we think we're the more sophisticated and yet don't know the difference between America and Canada, second because America sees Canada as such a tedious sleeping partner, and yet Canada is subversively sending idiots into the global marketplace with American accents. Of course, I'm being ironic. Canadian accents are not the same as American ones!)<br><br>In fact, this is absolute moonshine, since the consummate and well-documented superiority of US telly over British telly is largely due to their superior grasp of irony (as well as the fact that they have more cash). Take, for instance, the opening sequences of Six Feet Under versus the opening sequences of Casualty - they both start every episode with a vignette in which a stranger dies a horrible death or suffers a hideous accident. In Six Feet Under, this will never be straightforward - the porn star will never die because her silicon implants explode, she will die in some way that could happen to anyone; the wheezing, scared-looking sportsman will turn out to have been just a bit thirsty, while his amazingly strong team-mate will be dying in the background from heat stroke. There's always some cosmic irony, swiftly followed by ironic dialogue. In Casualty, on the other hand - man leaves pub in middle of day; commences dangerous-looking welding job; burns own eye out in drunk accident. Dur.<br><br>Germans and irony<br><br>Not speaking German, nor watching much German TV, nor having read any German literature apart from Bernard Schlink who, let me tell you, is about as ironic as a dog chasing a squirrel, it's difficult to tell whether or not there's any truth in the rumour that they have no sense of irony. However, since they invented it (well, they invented Schlegel), it's more than likely that they've got plenty. To anyone who thinks I'm insufficiently bigoted, I have serious doubts about the French.<br><br>Irony in emailing and texts<br><br>Texting is a truly tricky form for the ironist - very brief texts are difficult to make ironic simply because it's difficult to inject many layers into seven words. However, if you write a very long text, because it's such a bugger to do, your extra effort suggests a sincerity - an undudelike urge to be understood - that sits all wrong with the irony. To get round this, forms like "(!)" and "Not" and "have evolved", but they're pretty dumb and basic.<br><br>With emails, people with a lot of time on their hands can, obviously, give themselves room to develop an ironic theme, but for people with jobs, e-etiquette demands instant response, which brings you down to the very rudiments of irony - I Love My Boss; I'm Delighted That My Ex Is Going Out With That Attractive Woman; I Really Couldn't Be More Pleased That You've Lost a Stone. Once it's as bald as that, and you're without extra signifiers like eyebrows, there is a danger of misunderstanding. However, I think we're actually more alert to irony than we are to its opposite, sincerity. Take the case of Rena Salmon, who last year shot her husband's lover, and then texted him to that effect. Her words were, "I have shot Lorna. This is not a joke." A perfect demonstration of my point (I don't get many of those) - the first thing you think when you read a text is that it is a joke.<br><br>Situational irony<br><br>This article has almost exclusively been about rhetorical irony, which has much more fluidity and variety than situational irony. That does not mean that situational irony is entirely straightforward - often, the appearance that God or Fate was attempting to make you think one thing when another was going to happen is down to your own misreading or wilful blindness, and therefore isn't ironic at all. Furthermore, where rhetorical irony can be as simple as saying the opposite of what you mean, cosmic irony is not simply experiencing the opposite of what you thought was going to happen. For instance, if I was having a party, and I thought my dad was going to come, and he didn't, that wouldn't be ironic. If, on the other hand, I was having a party and I didn't want my dad to come, and I spent three weeks working on a brilliant cover story for why he couldn't come, and then my sister accidentally blew my cover, so I had to invite him anyway, and then, on the way here, he got run over and died - that's ironic.<br><br>I hope he realises that that example was, well, not ironic, but certainly meant with no ill will.<br><br>But, whatever (here, with ludic irony, I'm trying to get out of writing a conclusion by affecting the jargon of the slothful teenager. Obviously, I don't mean "whatever" - I don't share the disaffected carelessness of the standard "whatever" user. But I'm still getting out of writing a conclusion. To know inauthenticity isn't the same as being authentic. Or even, just because you ironically know you're wrong doesn't make you right).<br><br>------------------------------------<br><br>1. Jack Lynch, Literary Terms. I would strongly urge you not to read any more footnotes, they are only here to make sure I don't get in trouble for plagiarising.<br><br>2. 'In it [irony] everything should be all jest and all serious-ness, everything guilelessly open and deeply hidden... It contains and arouses a sense of the indissoluble antagonism between the absolute and the relative, between the impossibility and the necessity of complete communication. It is the freest of all licences, because through it one transcends oneself, but at the same time it is the most prescribed, because [it is] absolutely necessary.'<br><br>3. This is obviously debatable, but Paul Fussell in The Great War And Modern Memory made the case compellingly. Truthfully, British irony's political usage has to be deemed to have started with Swift, alongside Addison and Steele. Oh, go on, disagree with me if you like, see if I care.<br><br>4. Paul de Man, The Rhetoric Of Temporality<br><br>5. Both these quotes are from Michiko Kakutani, Critic's Notebook: The Age Of Irony Isn't Over After All; Assertions Of Cynicism's Demise Belie History</div>

With each, we have mused about what worked and what did not; answered questions about how the system was described by Mark and what we did to make it fit our way of doing things, etc.<br><br>Well, we've discussed it for AF1, AF2, AF3, AF4, and now DWM.  We have pretty much answered every question about the "official rules" of each of those systems, 43 times over ... and, BTW, continue to do so with mostly good humor.  We've talked about every conceivable tweak over and over and over.  So here we find ourselves, having built personal relationships based on a small area of common interest.  Some of us enjoy each other's company.  We also enjoy finding out who we are and what other interests we might share.  And yet ...<br><br>... some people, those who sit in silence on the sidelines contributing virtually nothing at all, jeer that we are not performing for them up to their standard.  We are not doing enough back flips.  The hoops we jump through are not soaked with gasoline and lit.  The tight ropes are not high enough and we have not removed those pesky safety nets.<br><br>Well, as I say, it is interesting to me.  What else could these lurkers want us to entertain them with?<br><br>And yeah, this whole list is "growing organically", and I suppose that is what irks some people.  The organic direction is not the direction they wish ... I suppose.</div>

<div class="content">Mike: as in any spectator sport, some jeering is bound to result. This only demonstrates the strength of following Mark has in his system and in this forum. What would be tragic would be apathy, as the board sinks into mud-slinging exchanges.<br><br>As it happens, this forum is hardly that way...we have the regular posters like yourself keeping it real and relevant, even if it goes down rabbit trails.</div>

<div class="content">Interesting point by Alan, "if you don't like where the board is at, start contributing!".<br><br>I, and lots of others, have done so in the past, only for the thread to descend into a farce, littered with juvenile comments.<br><br>In fact, that's Fred & Christian's whole point!</div>

<div class="content">Threads only descend into farce when the point is not worth pursuing in the view of most.  As to "juvenile", one man's juvenile is another's sophisticated high humor.  And that is the real point.  If you post and don't get a nibble, that should tell you something.</div>

<div class="content">Simon,<br><br>Please link to the thread.<br><br>Bottom line:<br><br>A thread is either trivial (answered within three posts), then people begin to discuss their idiosyncratic hacks and tweaks. And sometimes this leads to "off-topic" discussions.<br><br>A thread requires thought and consideration and for some reason only a few folks find these threads to stand out.<br><br>Mark's systems are just too simple and effective. What are you going to do?<br><br> What interests me most is how his techniques fit into and shape or other practices I engage in and how to understand how his system works within what some might incorrectly call my "worldview".<br><br>If you didn't get the answer you were looking for in your thread, re-post it and I am sure within 12 hours you have more answers than you could possibly ever use.</div>
