<div class="content">11 months ago Mark introduced DWM.  Then nothing new for 10 months. Then we got into focusing on completion of tasks and the ideas exploded. Here's the lowdown:<br><br>First Mark mentioned in an offhand post a different wAy to organIze DWM. DWM2 is just a new way to organize the  DWM system. It makes the paper work easier. <br><br>In order to try pure Focus, Mark ran a 3 task system, 3T:  pick 3 things, alternate between them until two are done, then pick 2 more and repeat. This worked very well. <br><br>Next Mark integrated 3T with AF4. Some blog posts showed it worked wonders. <br><br>Then Mark came up with a 2 column version of AF1 (his favorite system), and it worked so well he called it Super AutoFocus, or SuperFocus and is recommending it above all other systems. <br><br>SuperFocus rules are currently being clarified and tried by many people here.<br>As far as anyone knows so far, these systems are all strength and no weakness ;-). I'd suggest for now, join the masses with SuperFocus. Read the threads about their rules.</div>

<div class="content">I have been using Triple Task.  I am not sure there was formal version or write up of this by Mark, but I have written up the rules I am using on my website and answered some questions in a post to Leon yesterday clarifying how I am using it.  TT the way I am doing it is a very simple paper based system that has been very effective for me.  You can read about it on my website.  After trying most of the systems and designing two of my own, I am very happy with it.  Good luck<br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div>
