<div class="content">It's noon on Monday and the only thing I've done is my morning walk and finishing the kids' report card responses. This afternoon is busy. Tomorrow is either errands or car-less (depending whether they do my car immediately or drive me home). The kids are home from school Friday.<br><br>If I turn to next Monday's page and declare this week backlogged, I can the spend this week making progress on the things I want to and ignore the things I should do.<br><br>Somehow I don't think that's an option, sigh.</div>

<div class="content">DWM lets you skip days by pushing back the calendar.  So rather than mark this week as a backlog, move everything back one week.  Redate today's page as Next Monday, etc.<br><br>Now, guess what: nothing expires until next Monday!  Go crazy! :-)  <br><br>Well, maybe just focus on things that _need_ doing now, and don't worry about the expiry date, because everything else will keep for a week.  Should make for less pressure, I hope.<br><br>God bless.</div>

<div class="content">What about things that have to be done on Wednesday? They'd be pushed to Thursday.<br><br>I've declared today a "maintain" day. Dailies the family will notice (or not) are done. Voice lesson is done, but I didn't practise before it.<br><br>Now it's a cup of tea and probably shorthand until the noise-makers arrive. I enjoyed making progress on shorthand until Dtr said all the other karate parents stay in the noisy dojo rather than drive (in the cold wet dark) to the library). Good for Christmas knitting, not so good for shorthand.<br><br>I'll also start ignoring my husband at bedtime. We both tend to say, "One more page," then at the end of that page notice the other is still reading, so read just one more. Repeat.<br><br>Tomorrow I'll look at today's list and tomorrow's and make some decisions. But that's tomorrow. Today a me day. My tea is ready.</div>

<div class="content">Wednesday? DWM isn't about things that have to be done on a particular day.  The expiry date takes it off the list, but if it must be done before then, well, it must be done.  <br><br>I tried shorthand, learned the strokes, but I couldn't hack it.  My left-handed writing is just too sloppy, and I can't read back what I write.  <br><br>This week I'd suggest drop everything not urgent, and get ahead of the game by Friday.  Meanwhile, happy cup of tea!</div>

<div class="content">Good to hear someone is still using shorthand. I thought it had gone the way of Morse code.</div>
