<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>Have you considered setting up a simple poll to measure the results and experiences of the beta testers of AF1?<br><br>It would be interesting to then later do the same for AF2 and compare the results.<br><br>It would also be interesting to add a comparison to GTD and DIT in the poll to see where AF stands compared to these systems.....<br></div>

<div class="content">Cruisader:<br><br>Interesting thought. I'm not sure how it would actually be done, but I'll give it some thought.</div>

<div class="content">I just googled on 'free online poll' got a *lot* of results. Seems like it shouldn't be too hard to set up... Maybe someone else in this community has some experience with this?<br><br>Statistics on the following would be cool:<br>- overal comparison of well-known methods<br>- how long people managed to stick to AF on average<br><br>Maybe this community could help edit the list of questions/answers. Anyone else interested in this?</div>

<div class="content">There are a LOT of free web-based survey/poll tools out there.  SurveyMonkey is the one I am most familiar with and they do have a free option for smaller surveys.</div>

<div class="content">I do survey research for a living (not survey programming) but designing questions, analysis, etc, Happy to write some questions and help with the analysis at the end. I have no experience with online polls, survey monkey or otherwise! <br><br>I'll add this to my AF2 list... :)</div>
