<div class="content">I don't see this listed in TM systems or No-List methods. <br>There were a series of blog posts on this question. <br><br><a href="../blog/A New Question for FVP, Simple Scanning and Life in General.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2021/1/17/a-new-question-for-fvp-simple-scanning-and-life-in-general.html</a><br><a href="../blog/A New Question - Examples.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2021/1/19/a-new-question-examples.html</a><br><a href="../blog/A New Question - and no answers.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2021/1/20/a-new-question-and-no-answers.html</a><br><a href="../blog/Update on the New Question.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2021/1/30/update-on-the-new-question.html</a><br><a href="../blog/Continuing the Experiment.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2021/2/3/continuing-the-experiment.html</a><br><br>When these blog posts and discussion first appeared, I had the hardest time understanding what the question meant. But I understand much better after studying these posts. <br><br>Mark Forster writes: <br>So the new question I have come up with focuses on the negative consequences of not doing the task, rather than the positive consequences of doing it:<br><br><What am I resisting NOT doing? (Note that the question is not What am I resisting, not doing? The comma would change the meaning completely)<br><br>This question is the reverse of What am I resisting doing? as it measures my resistance to the negative consequences of failing to do the task, rather than the negative feelings associated with doing the task. And once I’ve experienced how much I am resisting those negative consequences, I will want to do the task rather than avoid it.><br><br>Mark Forster suggests: <br><If you are working off a list, you might try "Will I regret not doing this?"><br><br>And also: <br> <As I've said several times in this discussion, the key point about the question is the word "resisting". The question targets the resistance you are already feeling to the negative consequences of failing to do a task.><br><br>And:<br><There are several additional forms this question can take:<br><br>What am I most resisting NOT doing?<br><br>This is the form I use as a stand-alone question (i.e. without any list) or with Simple Scanning, The Bounce and suchlike methods.<br><br>What am I resisting NOT doing now?<br><br>This is similar to the previous question but with an increased emphasis on immediacy.<br><br>With FV, FVP and other similar comparison methods, the question is:<br><br>What am I resisting NOT doing more than x?><br><br><br>Bernie writes: <br><Imagine "DON'T" in front of each item on your list. Then ask "What am I most resisting?"<br><br>The original wording was a non-starter for me, as others are reporting, but I am beginning to grasp it with the DON'T method. Once grasped, I can see how the original wording could be effective.<br>January 19, 2021 at 16:06 | Registered Commenter Bernie><br><br>This advice has helped me. I have used it with a long list. <br>So for example:<br>What am I resisting not doing? <br>The tax deadline is approaching. <br>Don't pay your taxes. <br>I am resisting that message. <br>I am resisting not paying my taxes.<br><br>The deadline for renewing my driver's license is approaching. <br>Don't renew my license. <br>I am resisting not renewing my license.</div>

<div class="content">So trying with the question "Will I regret not doing this?"<br><br>Will I regret not paying my taxes?<br>Will I regret not renewing my driver's license? <br><br>There might not be a lot of positive motivation to do these things, but the negative consequences outweigh these.  <br>The question what am I resisting not doing? is intended to use our Resistance.  <br>Mark Forster emphaszed that it is not the intellectual understanding of the negative consequences, but our resistance to them that is important here.</div>
