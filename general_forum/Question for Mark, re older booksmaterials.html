<div class="content">Mark, do you see your older books and materials as building on SF or something completely separate?</div>

<div class="content">I have a related question. Or maybe it is the same question. I'm almost done reading the free download of Make Your Dreams Come True and it made me wonder whether Mark (or anyone on the forums) asks themselves "What's Better Today" and builds on their successes that way, creates a dialog with the future self and/or follows the methodology which lets them define their vision for the future.</div>

<div class="content">Don-<br>I wondered this too-I'm curious as to whether Mark is still using the What's Better? list.</div>

<div class="content">I have always liked the "What's Better Today?" list and the Coaching Dialogue from the Dreams book. However, their strengths only emerge if you make it a habit to journal your entries regularly. They fall apart rapidly if they are left alone, like weeds over your best ideas and goals.<br><br>I've started the process again after Mark's announcement about the "Dreams" give-away and the old uplifting feeling is back. In addition, I tried the Goal Achievement Method on a mini objective and it worked as if by magic. The goal was to clear my paper intray in one sitting - something I've never been able to do fully in any given day. By writing out the goal in a fashion that would appeal to me and using the present reality part to set out the problems I've always had completing this task, I was able to lay out a plan to process the documents into actionable AF tasks or to file the papers away.<br><br>That's inspired me to do something more challenging, and hopefully with continued success, I will be able to get down to re-writing my long term vision. So if the questions here are being asked for the purpose of gauging the efficacy of the approach, my own opinion is that they work really well. <br><br>I think Gerry's method has the same pull elements to it, and a lot of people reported success with it. I like Mark's method because the approach appealed to me personally.</div>

<div class="content">I use variations on these principles often and just love them I think they have a depth and subtlety which is not apparent at first reading. Using them regularly will change you for the better. Mark has clearly done a lot of solid research before publishing.</div>
