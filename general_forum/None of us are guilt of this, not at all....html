<div class="content">It's true!  If we had *actually* got everything done, why would we visit a site telling us to do what we already did?  I like to hope I'm getting better, but we'll see.</div>

<div class="content">I'd bet big bucks that those who have a compelling "why" don't visit productivity sites. I'd be willing to place this bet because my involvement in productivity information (books, sites, software) is directionally proportional to the amount of work I don't enjoy doing. The illusion is that the work is getting done by discussing productivity. Kinda like shooting heroin to take care of your crumbling marriage. <br><br>Unfortunately I've been involved with some amazing projects, and can't recall spending an ounce of time or energy on blogs/forums discussing where to put, or how to prioritize a certain task. I say unfortunately because it is so glaringly obvious to me that I don't have anything to do at this moment that stirs my heart.</div>

<div class="content">> I'd bet big bucks that those who have a compelling "why" don't visit productivity sites.<br><br>avrum, for me that is almost true. But I would have to strike the word "why" and replace it with "pressure" or "deadline." I am currently set up with a wonderful "why" and plenty of autonomy to do it. My schedule is a little choppy and does distract me, but it was much worse in the past when I got a lot more done. The difference is that my prior productive periods had not only a lot of "why," but also a lot of "need it done yesterday."<br><br>My current lack of productivity only began some five years ago and really puzzles me. My last compelling "why" project that I completed was about a year and a half ago. It was also my last compelling "why" project that had a deadline. I blazed through it in six weeks and loved it (mostly, except for a couple of times when I allowed myself to get sleep-deprived).<br><br>One can speculate endlessly about the reasons, but my intuition tells me I am simply used to this pattern, since I was a little boy in school: serve everyone else's deadlines first, then attend to your own—if you have any energy left.<br><br>Once in a while, someone mentions "addicted to the rush of a deadline," and I know exactly what they are talking about. Adding a deadline to a tedious task energizes me, even if I hate the task. Particularly if I can throw a heroic all-nighter at it, I come away feeling extremely capable and satisfied. The experience of being that focused is something to me like "runner's high."<br><br>For me, the holy grail of time management is to get that level of focus and competence from my *own* deadlines. Or, I should say, my own priorities, without the deadlines.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the link, Bernie.  I would strongly encourage newcomers to the forum (and old-timers like me) to visit the archive pages of this site.  There's gold in there!</div>
