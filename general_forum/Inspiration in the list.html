<div class="content">New idea to me: besides including todos, chores, and projects, I've taken to writing down helpful words in my list:<br>- quotes<br>- goals/dreams<br>- principles<br>- bible verses<br>- things to be mindful of<br>- helpful thoughts (like from CL, Do what needs doing and accept your feelings)<br><br>These aren't actionable, but they change my mindset for whatever actionable work follows.<br>I allow myself to delete or reenter these non-tasks at will.  Be careful not to dismiss your dreams.</div>

<div class="content">As always from you, food for thought!<br><br>I confess to doing similar now and again, it does keep things in balance.</div>

<div class="content">I like it, it's a good reminder.  I wonder if just adding "quiet time" to reflect on these things instead of listing them out specifically would be better.</div>

<div class="content">If you had a handy list of these it could work well I suppose, but maybe not. It's hard to focus on two things so autofocusing on one thing at a time might prove more effective. Or not.</div>
