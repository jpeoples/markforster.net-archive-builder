<div class="content">Since the discussion has turned to goals and I am not really doing much with my site, I have posted for free my goal achievement system - Desired Outcomes Implementation Technology.  You can get it for free on my site, no opt in.  The link is on the left.  The TM stuff is also there for free as well.  I no longer have a discussion forum, so if Mark is ok with it, I can answer questions here.  Thanks<br><br>Gerry<br><br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div>

<div class="content">Hey Gerry. In re your TTA method, what are your impressions of JD Meier's 3 outcomes/day? (<a href="http://www.gettingresults.com/wiki/The_Rule_of_3" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.gettingresults.com/wiki/The_Rule_of_3</a> ). He goes into more detail about it on his wiki and in his blog ("Sources of Insight"). <br><br>His idea, I think, is that an outcome should also be doable in a day but it can be made up of several undergirding tasks. I imagine the feeling of accomplishment for either task or result would still feel good, but thinking of good outcomes is more difficult for me than thinking of atomic tasks.<br><br>JD also advocates for a 3 outcomes for the year/quarter/month/week/day so that lower-level outcomes support the higher-level ones. <br><br>It reminds me somewhat of your DOIT method, where one has to devise 3 outcomes for the 90-day period, but in that case, I'm only generating tasks for tomorrow.<br><br>I find JD's approach helpful for planning my week -- one of my weekly outcomes is "I'm packed and ready to go for our vacation," while my daily outcomes include stuff like "Pack clothes," "Decide which books to read on the trip," etc. <br><br>That said, JD's approach seems to favor top-down planning, whereas DOIT is sort of bottom-up. Once I decide the three big DOIT outcomes, I don't need to think in terms of weeks or months, just tomorrow.<br><br>Thanks for making your methods available. I've already shared DOIT with a co-worker, who wants to use it to help his jr-high son plan some goals.</div>

<div class="content">Mike,<br><br>I glanced quickly at it and there are some similarities.  He also must have been influenced by the rule of three as I was.  A big difference is that DO IT is not a time management system.  He applies the rule of three to time management.  In DO IT, you use what ever time management system you like and set aside a block of time for DO IT.  For me I use time management at work but DO IT is for bigger life goals which for me do not encompass work. <br><br>Please note the desired outcomes in DO IT can take years, ie become a doctor master classical guitar, the 90 days just happens to be the time a notebook lasts.<br><br>I wish your co-workers son well and feel free to have them ask me about the program.  The program works because it is simple to do and most importantly builds action muscles while providing a feedback loop so one can improve constantly.  Please feel free to ask any questions on implementing it.<br><br>Gerry</div>
