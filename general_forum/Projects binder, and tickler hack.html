<div class="content">I keep a binder with one-page projects, sorted alphabetically.  These projects each are mentioned in my AF lists, so I get to them according to AF principles.  At the front of the binder is a one-glance tickler system:<br><br>Start with a wall calendar, a pair of scissors, and a hole puncher.<br>1 Cut the pages apart.<br>2 Punch holes on the bottom of the calendar.  <br>3 Put the pages into the binder.  The higher dates are by the binder rings.<br>4 After every week, cut that week out of the calendar.<br><br>Result: I always see, at a glance, the next 30 days' schedule.<br>I use this as a tickler at the front of my binder.  If I need notes with an activity, I make a project page, and file it alphabetically referenced by the calendar square.</div>

<div class="content">Hello Alan.<br><br>The first and last paragraphs are enticing.<br><br>Maybe it's my age or my current battle fighting off sinus and/or flu, but the bit in the middle loses me.<br><br>'wall calendar': do you mean the ones with a month to a view ie all 28 - 31 pages for that month only with each page number a square?<br><br>If you punch the holes at the bottom then how do the higher numbers (for the week or the month) appear next to the binder rings?  Surely it depends on the layout of the wall calendar, weeks across or down?<br><br>Sorry, I can't visualise it, but I remain intrigued.<br><br>Roger J</div>

<div class="content">More apologies, I meant to mention above that I have also started using a project binder with single or more pages and to extract the individual tasks from each project for AF4 along the lines you and others have mentioned.<br><br>I've recently re-started using AF4 and am using the ADOCs binder system which has featured before on this forum.<br><br>I have entered the following task on my AF4: "Post update on AF4 as customised and using the ADOCs binder system"<br><br>More on this later, hopefully within 28 days as I'm trying to blend in a bit of DWM as well!</div>

<div class="content">September<br>--------- 01 02 03 04<br>05   06   07   08   09  10 11<br>12 13 14 15 16 17 18<br>19 20 21 22 23 24 25<br>26 27 28 29 30<br>     binder holes here<br><br>But I've cut away "September", and the first 3 weeks, so I see October weeks at the top.</div>

That should integrate really well with my DWM system, which is based on "Tasks" in Microsoft Outlook.   One nice feature is you can easily insert hyperlinks to the OneNote page into the Task.<br><br>I will give it a try.   Thanks for the idea Alan!!</div>

<div class="content">You're very welcome Seraphim :-).  The above system is how I operate at home.  <br><br>I use OneNote a lot for my work.  There I have projects sorted by category, not alphabet.  I suppose I could make it alphabetical; might even be a good idea, thanks  :-)<br><br>I use hyperlinks from tasks to projects.  My tasks are in OneNote rather than Outlook, but these programs inter-operate well so I think your approach would be fine.</div>
