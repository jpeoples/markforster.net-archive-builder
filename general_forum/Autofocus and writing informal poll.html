<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-01-26 21:27</div>
<div class="content">First, the background to my question. I'm very interested in collecting some answers to the question, though (as, I hope, other people who do a lot of writing will be), so please just skip the background and go straight to the question in the last two paragraphs if you want to don't want to spend time reading the background.<br><br>I'm an academic – a philosophy professor – and Autofocus has been working incredibly well for me in lots and lots of ways. One of the central parts of my work, and the part I care most about, is research. Given my field, this translates into doing lots of reading, thinking, and writing (along with various supporting activities like going to conferences, organising conferences, giving talks, corresponding with people, etc.). Autofocus has had an immediate and quite remarkable effect on the reading and thinking fronts: I've been doing more reading, in more areas; I've been feeling more engaged and (dare I say it) authentic as I go about my work; and I've been feeling more creative, and have noticed that new ideas are flowing more easily. All of that is wonderful. It's much less clear, however, that Autofocus is good for my writing – at least, if 'writing' is narrowly defined, so that it means sitting and typing away at a manuscript (as opposed to reading, thinking, and note-taking which is related to writing projects). In fact, I haven't gotten much of that done at all since I started with Autofocus three weeks ago. I've perservered and tried not to worry about it, partly to see whether things would change as I settle into Autofocus, and partly because I was open to the idea that I was discovering, through Autofocus, that other things are more important at the moment than work on the paper I'm in the process of revising. But at this point, I'm starting to get anxious about it....<br><br>There's been some discussion of writing and Autofocus elsewhere on the forum, and Mark has recommended experimenting with the idea of treating writing time as a scheduled activity, outside the purview of Autofocus (which, as he mentioned, is the approach the majority of productive writers take – there's lots of empirical evidence of this). I've been hoping that it would turn out that I'd be able to take a straight Autofocus approach to writing, however, because I feel such a sense of freedom and fluidity with Autofocus, and because it seems to remove resistance so effectively for so many things. But so far, no clear evidence that that's going to work. (When I have written, it's felt fluid and easy; but I haven't done much.) So here's the question....<br><br>Has anyone found that a "pure" Autofocus approach to writing has been successful? I'm aiming this at people for whom writing is a central part of their work. And I don't really have in mind writing memos and reports of a few pages – something I've had to do plenty of as a department chair in the past – but writing articles, papers, books (whether fiction or non-fiction)...that sort of thing.<br><br>Thanks. And it would be interesting to hear from (or hear updates from) people who've tried to handle writing with Autofocus unsuccessfully, too.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Martin,<br><br>It is important to me to write daily, though writing is not essential to my job. I have a number of tasks that I want to complete daily, or three times a week. My first stab at AF ended in failure because I could not effectively handle these recurrent tasks in my AF list. If I wrote "Write" in my list, was it the writing task for Monday or last Friday?<br><br>After my first flubbing of AF, I brushed myself off and determined that I would need to reinstate a list of recurrent daily tasks, as I had had with DIT and GTD. Writing is on my recurrent list. <br><br>I follow the AF rules with the addition that I can work on my recurrent list at any time throughout the day. My goal is to complete my recurrent list each day. <br><br>This means that I will write every day, though not necessarily at the same time each day.<br><br>I know that this flies in the face of some versions of AF, but I have found it to be a quite effective method.</div>

<div class="content">I'm working on a screenplay and I have found it helpful to break my writing down into several tasks and to scatter the tasks throughout my lists. <br>So for instance -- <br><br>"Write the car scene<br>Work on the love scene<br>Work on the transitional scene<br>Work on the outline<br>Do some thinking about the fight scene"<br>ETC.<br><br>Then I work as much as I want on any of these tasks.  Usually I don't complete it at the first (or even the fifth) attempt, but I keep working, crossing off, and meeting my task again later.  I also insert an all purpose "Do some work on the script" throughout my lists.  That item is sort of like a free pass -- it enables me to work on ANY aspect of the script that I choose.<br>So far I've made a fair amount of progress in the few weeks that I've been doing this. And this has been during a time when other commitments have threatened to devour my time.  So I'm finding Autofocus to be a nice way of approaching my writing.  <br>One thing I would add  -- I try to get to my writing first thing every day. That's important too. <br>best,<br>Steve</div>

<div class="content">I've been finding that the benefit of AF to my writing is that it encourages me to do at least *something.* I gave a speech two shots with AF so that when it was time to really get serious and finish it, I felt I had at least already made a start (though in truth, I didn't use anything I wrote before). Because I was under deadline I had to forget my AF lists and just write. I've done that with other writing on deadline as well. I've tried having a set time to write, but it seems like that builds my resistance. I honestly think I would have gotten less writing done than with AF. Sometimes I think what we do is compare AF to the ideal scenario rather than actual practice. For example, if I compare my speech writing with AF to writing a half hour a day, AF comes up short. But how many times do I actually write half an hour a day? If scheduled writing makes you more productive, stick with it. If it builds resistance, stick with AF. I doubt you'll ignore any hard deadlines.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the responses, and the suggestions. As I understand you all, at least two out of the three people who've responded are essentially answering 'no' to my question: moises because of the DIT-style daily recurring task list, and Mel because AF was abandoned when the deadline(s) approached. <br><br>Steve, you *seem* to be reporting success with a pure AF approach, and the way you're doing it makes sense, but even there I'm not sure if you're describing a pure Autofocus approach. On pure Autofocus, after all, one can't be at all sure that one is going to get to writing first thing every day (which is indeed a rule lots of writing experts swear by). Depending on where I left off last night, and what stands out, I might end up doing all sorts of other things first. I also wonder if, when you say that you've scattered various specific writing tasks throughout your lists, you've done something that deviates from the basic instructions. Did you deliberately arrange for the tasks to be scattered that way (rather than all on one or two pages, say), or did it just develop naturally that way? I can't see any guarantee that it will, in any case.<br><br>I also wonder whether your approach, Steve, would work for all stages of the writing process. I'm currently revising and editing something, and that's pretty much just a matter of going page-by-page from the beginning to the end doing some polishing, so it's harder to see what the tasks would be at this stage, other than "Do some editing/polishing of the X paper".<br><br>Anyway, thanks again for the responses. I'm currently thinking about experimenting with a variant of an approach Hannah suggested some time ago; I'll post on that if it works well.</div>

<div class="content">I don't mean to suggest that there's something wrong with not taking a pure AF approach; I'm just curious about whether anyone's managed to write productively that way, because it's what I was hoping for.</div>

<div class="content">I've been stuck on my writing for a while, and AF hasn't automatically dissolved my procrastination there. I've seen great progress in other areas, but still have a lot of resistance to doing any writing work. I suspect I'm going to have to dismiss a bunch of writing tasks soon, and that'll just depress me.</div>

<div class="content">The jury is still out for me on this, but I will know in a few weeks.<br><br>I have done less composing since starting AF. On the other hand, on Monday I sent music off to a concert organiser five weeks early, due to lots of admin, typesetting and other important but not yet urgent things AF had me do.<br><br>With that done, AF does seem to be steering me to composing, and I lost track of time while doing it yesterday, which is good.<br><br>On the other hand, AF has led me to undertake a task which was not on my agenda originally at all, to prepare a talk. I think this is a positive development, but if so it takes AF beyond the realm of efficiency into the area of growth.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-01-28 10:33</div>
<div class="content">Laurence<br><br>I would definitely agree that AF goes beyond the realm of efficiency into the area of growth.  Apart from just plain old getting stuff done, I have started to action areas I had previously only had on a dream/someday list.  I had wanted to start writing a book for years, and had previously done a few chapters, but like a lot of things it just disappeared into the background with the day to day urgent having the louder voice.<br><br>In the few short weeks since starting AF that has not only resurfaced but I have also started action on it, in that I have made contact with someone in the publishing industry to seriously move that goal forward.  Where it will lead I have no idea - but I'm enjoying the journey!   :-) <br></div>

<div class="meta">2009-01-28 14:42</div>
<div class="content">Martin, in a sense, I think my approach to writing is still pure AF because I am using the common sense rule. I work on writing projects as they appear in my lists, but when the deadline looms, I continue working as necessary. One curious thing about writing with AF vs. DIT is you move lots of projects forward a little rather than working one project to completion at a time. That is where individual differences come into play. For me, having lots of projects progressing is enormously satisfying, where for others that divided focus could be positively nerve-wracking. The cool thing is you can control that by what you put on your list. I'm actually at the point where I am resisting adding projects because I know I'm at my limit if that makes sense. On the other hand, too few projects on a list may build more resistance. Best wishes with your writing!</div>

<div class="meta">2009-01-28 16:21</div>
<div class="content">I agree that Autofocus is a great way of bringing many projects forward by small steps -- and finding out that a stray idea is actually worth developing (or not) -- and keeping many projects alive.  However, the drawbacks that people mention are ones that I have experienced too.   I would add one thing that I have learned about my working methods. A writing project of any scope always demands a period of intense concentrated work. This can be days, weeks or months (or even years!). And if I look back on projects that I have completed -- or periods of great productivity --  I realize that the best way of working, for me,  has always been to set some kind of daily goal.  It could be a word quota, a page quota, or even a paragraph quota. It could be a time-goal, such as "three hours a day at my desk with nothing in front of me except my writing."   And then to stay with this daily goal for a long period of time.  So maybe the DIT method is better when it's time to settle in and do some heavy work on a single project.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-01-28 20:11</div>
<div class="content">Steve, I agree with what you just posted. Heavy work on a single project is the way to go. I usually work a certain amount of hours, unless I am under a deadline and then I just WORK! No mercy either. I think for me that I was hoping that AF or GTD or DIT or something would make it easier to write my stuff, but the best I can really say is that those Time Management systems do take care of the other stuff so I can be relatively sure I won't go down the tubes while I AM writing. Writing is hard. I am gifted but not all that much gifted. I have to work. And as someone said, I can write or I can dig ditches. I think I will write.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-01-28 20:22</div>
<div class="content">I have to agree when it comes to big writing projects. I was only able to finish my book by having a hard deadline and then counting back to the present to see how many pages a day needed to be written and when each subgoal had to be done. I often wrote well into the morning to get it done. All AF lists (had they existed then) would have been out the window. But I also can't work like that all the time.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-01-28 22:03</div>
<div class="content">Mel: Point taken about the common sense rule. It does sound like you're deviating from a pure AF approach elsewhere, though (not that there's anything wrong with that... :) ), if you're resisting adding projects to the list so that you don't get too scattered or overwhelmed (or whatever exactly it is). One of the original dos and don'ts is "Don't try to pre-edit what you put into the system".<br><br>Laurence: Your experience sounds similar to mine. I've read the "Studio 13" thread (was it?), and was encouraged by your early reports, but this update sounds more like my past few weeks: some really good forward movement on projects, but mostly due to lots of activity on fronts other than the "hard core" – writing, composing, etc. – so that doubts about entrusting that core work to a pure AF approach start to arise.<br><br>And Steve, Trish, and Mel: yes, I've often worked that way in the past, too, and with success. But scheduling hours and so on does tend to mean that I end up battling resistance on a regular basis, which is why I've been hoping for an AF writing miracle....</div>

<div class="content">Martin, I was referring to resisting adding more backlogged projects. I don't think that deviates from the rules. In other words, if a new project comes up, it will absolutely get added to the list. I'm just not going through old notebooks looking for other maybe/someday projects as I know my list is pretty much maxed out. Hope that clarifies it.</div>

<div class="content">Trish, your praise isn't deserved. LOL But thank you.<br><br>Martin, what if you used BOTH approaches? Schedule writing time and if you resist your scheduled time, work on your AF list instead. It would be like using a same-day urgent list with an AF list and choosing which you'd rather do. I hope you will try it and let us know how it works for you!</div>
<h2>Reply by Martin</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-01-29 20:46</div>
<div class="content">Steve, and Trish: I remain a bit more optimistic about the possibility of removing resistance to writing (or, more realistically, perhaps, minimising it to negligible levels). Robert Boice, who did more in the way of careful empirical study of the issue than anyone else I've come across, certainly thought that writing need not involve a constant battle with resistance.<br><br>Mel: Yes, thanks, the comment about backlogged projects did clarify things for me. So maybe you're doing pure AF after all! I suppose that I was hoping, though, that AF might help with removing the need for so-called "binge" writing at deadline time (which, as Boice documents, tends to be counterproductive in the longer run). Re the twin approach idea: thanks for the suggestion. I strongly suspect I'd end up just working on my AF list most days of the week instead of doing scheduled writing, though, if I thought of my scheduled time that way. Maybe I'd be surprised; at the moment, though, I'm experimenting with a variant of an approach Hannah suggested (in a thread the title of which contains the phrase 'artists and similar creatures', or something close to that). But let us know if you try that approach and find it helpful.<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Just a thought from a non (but aspiring!) writer - I've had issues with significant backlog items that had a Jan 31 deadline.  Given that we have only been doing AF since 5 Jan, I am wondering if, as we get closer to a less deadline driven focus, whether some of the resistances/blocks will start to ease .................?<br><br>Just a thought .........</div>

<div class="meta">2009-01-29 21:23</div>
<div class="content">You misunderstand me. The resistance is good -- it's a necessary part of the equation -- like the resistance that water provides when you're swimming through it.</div>
<h2>Reply by Martin</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-01-29 22:44</div>
<div class="content">Steve: Perhaps we're using the word in two different ways. By 'resistance' I mean something close to this: an aversion to performing a task or engaging in an activity, and/or an impulse (possibly quite strong) to avoid it; and one which is associated with unpleasant feelings when one approaches the task in question. (This is how I meant it in the initial post on this thread, and throughout. I take it that this is more or less how Mark typically uses the term, too, incidentally, but maybe I'm wrong.) And so my point in my last comment was that I'm inclined to believe – partly on the basis of Boice's work – that resistance in that sense _isn't_ a necessary part of writing, or even a helpful or useful part of it, and that in fact one is better off without it, both as a writer and more generally (given that, the way I'm using the term, the feelings associated with resistance are, by definition, unpleasant). <br><br>If that is how you're using the term, then perhaps we just disagree.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-01-30 1:52</div>
<div class="content">Martin,<br><br>I agree with you that Boice's conclusions, backed by research, are worthy of quite serious consideration. <br><br>Two of his principles are "Avoid writing in binges," and "Write in small, regular amounts" (all references to page 79 of _Professors as Writers_). His work concludes that writing in binges leads to mood disorders. What I find of interest, and relevant to this forum, is the similarity between Boice's two principles and the AF-DIT little and often principle. <br><br>But I have found that "little" and "often" are relative notions. If my hands are getting very dried out by the cold weather here in the Northern Hemisphere, I might vow to put moisturizer on my hands often. In this instance, "often" might mean "at least three times a day." If I vow to implement a redesign on my website, working on it often might entail working on it at least a couple of times a week.<br><br>From day one, I found that I could not fit tasks into my AF list that I very much wanted to work on at least once a day. Part of the problem is that, although these tasks are not strictly time-specific, they tend to have more or less optimal time periods. So, I found it best to jump out of my AF sequence to fit these recurrent tasks into my day.<br><br>Another Boicean princple is "Write while you're fresh." That suggests another kind of time-sensitivity. <br><br>So, I end up with the ironic conclusion that the Boicean precepts on writing, which accord at a very deep level with the Forsterian Autofocus principle of little and often, are best implemented outside of the Autofocus system.<br><br>Or, you could do what I do, and redefine Autofocus, or call it "Autofocus*". <br><br>For me, Autofocus* is about having a calendar (also called "diary), a notebook list, and a recurrent list. Recurring time-specific items go on the calendar. One-off time-specific items go on the calendar. Other recurring daily items go on the recurrent list. <br><br>I don't bother putting lunch on my recurrent list. But I do it every day. The time I start lunch changes each day and the duration of my lunch changes as well. But, at some point each day, I step outside of my AF list and eat lunch.<br><br>My recurrent list works a lot like the index card technique that Mark suggested and then, apparently abandoned. My recurrent list is open before me throughout the day, alonside my AF list. At any time I can work off my AF page or my recurrent list. <br><br>The Boicean writer would, I believe, put a writing session on either the calendar or the recurrent list. I would not put it on the AF list because I have a lot less control over when I reach items on my AF list. (If I had to wait till I reached "lunch" on my AF list, I never would have stayed with AF.)</div>

<div class="meta">2009-01-30 4:00</div>
<div class="content">Thanks, moises – I think I agree with everything you say. If I give up on trying to write in a purely Autofocussed way, as I think I'm about to, I'll very probably put it on my calendar, and for first thing in the day, just as Boice would recommend (and as I've done for various stretches of time in the past). From experience, I think I'm much more likely to put the time in that way than if I had it on a recurrent daily tasks list. <br><br>The idea I'm toying with, in fact, is this: Schedule some time each morning for writing, but have my writing tasks on my AF list _too_, so that I have the option of doing more at other times of day if one of the writing tasks stands out. This isn't strictly Boicean, as I recall, because it opens up the possibility of that I might engage in some binge writing (as opposed to limiting myself to BDS's, and learning to stop); but I might try it anyway. <br><br>And yes, "little and often" is a flexible notion, as I understand Mark's way of using the phrase. Some time ago I asked a question on here about the functioning of the "little and often" principle in DIT, and in his reply Mark said that 4 hours a day could count as little and often if, say, you're a concert pianist thinking about practice. (I think it was 4 – this gets at the spirit of what Mark said, in any case.)</div>

<div class="content">I'm not familiar with Boice. What's his definition of binge writing? Don't the recommendations vary with what kind of writer you are? Say novelist vs. freelance writer? Little and often may not work for a novelist (but seems to for some here), but might work much better for a freelance writer with many projects. <br><br>I notice that when I come to a writing project on my AF list, I tend to get sucked into it much longer than other tasks. I don't have a problem with this per se, but it does mean I won't get through the list as quickly.</div>

<div class="content">What Trish said! This is awesome and I'm getting a lot out of it.<br><br>My DPhil thesis is my writing project, and it's a mere decade behind schedule, because I'm just brilliant at resisting.<br><br>And whilst I've made tons of progress on lots of other things, my "little and often" on my thesis gets less time less frequently than anything else on my AF list, though it's still moving forwards finally, thank goodness.<br><br>Interesting, too, about the connection between "binge writing" and "mood disorders" - binge writing (the "essay crisis") is exactly what undergraduates at Oxford do, because of their weekly tutorials but zero class time, and it has the highest rate of depression and anxiety amongst students of any university in Britain.

<div class="content">Interesting discussion.<br><br>Two techniques for reducing writing resistance:<br><br>1) Always regard writing and editing as two different tasks to be carried out at different times. This stops you getting endlessly stuck trying to find the perfect phrasing. Aim to write the worst first draft possible, and then polish it up. <br><br>2) I kept myself motivated while writing by keeping track of the average number of words I needed to write per day in order to meet the deadline. If the average rose I knew I was slacking, and if it fell I felt great.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-01-30 14:29</div>
<div class="content">Trish: Glad you're finding this useful. Me too.<br><br>Mel: Robert Boice was a psychologist at SUNY Stonybrook who did lots of research on and writing about writing. _Professors as Writers_ is a readily available (or was last time I checked), and it wouldn't be hard to generalise the central advice beyond the academic context (for those who are interested in that); _How Writers Journey to Comfort and Fluency_ contains a lot more, and is a bit different in its emphasis, but it's hard to get hold of and expensive (or was...). Similar in spirit to much of Boice, incidentally, is Paul Silvia's _How to Write a Lot_. That one's aimed at academics again, and in places at academic psychologists (which is not my field), but again would be easy to generalise in many respects. (And Silvia's a lot more fun to read!)<br><br>Binge writing involves spending lots of time not writing, whilst feeling anxious and guilty about it, and then (often in response to a deadline) writing a lot all at once, working very long hours, perhaps entering a state of "hypomania", getting exhausted and burned out, and then, partly as a result of being burned out, going back to not writing and feeling guilty and anxious. The contrast is with writing every day (or every work day) in a scheduled, consistent, and steady way.<br><br>And Boice's recommendations are supposed to apply to all sorts of writers. He emphasises what he calls "brief daily sessions", or BDS's, although 'brief' is a somewhat relative term, I think. There's a lot of evidence that the majority of productive fiction writers who write as a full-time job write in a regular, scheduled way for about 4 hours a day – but that's still a brief session compared with locking yourself in a room for three days.... And Boice and Silvia both put a lot of emphasis on the day that you can get a lot done in much less time per day, if you're writing regularly and adopting various other good habits.<br><br>little b: Funny you should say that: my undergraduate degree was at Oxford (as I'm guessing yours was), and I developed all the bad habits then – writing the tutorial paper in one go in the small hours the night before the tutorial.... I carried that approach over into grad school. It wasn't until I became faculty, with all the other demand that entails, that the bad habits really started to get me into trouble.<br><br>Mark: I don't know whether you know Boice, but your two recommendations are certainly in the same spirit. _Professors as Writers_ describes exercises designed to help you separate intial writing from editing; and Boice (in PAW) ,and Silvia both push the idea that some form of self-monitoring – keep a graph of how many words you've written per day, for example – has been shown to be a great aid to productivity. (The idea that one should make a point of separating intial writing and editing can be found in various places, though, as you may know – I'm thinking of Peter Elbow, for one.)<br></div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the information! I could have used it when I was in graduate school for psychology and kept putting off writing my thesis. Because of doing AF, I've learned that one reason I procrastinate is fear that a task will be "too hard." That was definitely the case with doing my master's research. If only someone had helped me break it down into manageable steps, I could have lived without intense anxiety.<br><br>With my dissertation, I was married and my dh told me that I was REQUIRED to finish my dissertation pronto. I wrote almost 18 hours a day most days and finished in record time. I'm not recommending that as I probably do still suffer some form of mental illness as a result. LOL But I was better off getting OUT of the academic environment. It's definitely not my thing, but I do have great admiration and respect for my colleagues who continue to do research and write about it for our benefit.<br><br>As for writing without editing, I imagine that's the appeal of the NaNoWriMo approach to novel writing. I'm thinking of giving that a go this summer.</div>

<div class="content">Re: Counting words every day.  There is a general maxim in management circles: "You get what you measure."  I've found this to be true in almost every area of life.  If you want to lose weight, weigh yourself and measure portion size and calories consumed and exercise done.  If you want to save money, keep track of your spending in Quicken or something.  Etc.<br><br>Re: Daily writing effort.  IIRC, Kurt Vonnegut used to get dressed in the morning in a suit and tie, pack a brown bag lunch, grab his briefcase and walk out the door, around back, down the path, to a small out building converted to an office.  There he would write until 5:00pm (taking his lunch break of course ;-).  Ray Bradbury's autobiography indicates that he forced himself to write a specific amount daily.  To each his own, but the biographies of most writers indicate that they approached it like a job so as to get it done.</div>

<div class="content">Once characteristic of all the quotas that Mike and Steve mention is that the writers stopped dead when they completed their quota of words, not when they reached the end of a chapter or section. <br><br>That's an important factor as it leaves a sense of incompletion, which makes it easier to get going again the next day.</div>

(At least, this was true a few years ago.) <br><br>Steve: What I love (and hate) about Trollope is that he had a full-time job at the post office, too, but wrote every day before going off to work.<br><br>Mark: Boice is big on stopping (and so is Jerry Mundis – anyone who's interested can Google him).

It's even shorter than _Professors as Writers_, and much more fun to read. Boice and Silvia don't agree on everything, but there's a lot they have in common. Boice's discussion is denser (though not dense in that book), more academic in style, goes into more detail about the studies that have been done (some by him); and contains more in the way of structured recommendations for writing exercises (as opposed to general habits your surrounding writing). Silvia is more fun. I suppose I'd recommend looking at both. (And although they're both aimed at academic writers, they're both easy to generalise in many respects.)</div>

<div class="content">I haven't posted in a while but have been diligently working my AF system in real time with my very real life. So much I like about it!! especially when the release comes and i do things like read stuff I have not found time for or dig into my novel or sort out my cd's. But I am at the point where I bail and it's hard because that release thing is just so cool. And welcome. And real. But can this system work w my life? I have roadtested it and observed what is going on and it ain't working. Well it's working where it's working but the rest of my life is falling apart. I sit here at my desk with stuff piled up all around me, and stuff on the counters in the kitchen and I am still not unpacked from my trip to Calif last week that was canceled.<br><br>I am completely snowed under with work this weekend. I have student work to read and critique, I have another novel I am hired to read and critique, I have a grant to apply for which can net me $$, I have my own novel to write, I have a slate of officers to come up with for a board I am on, and I have more than that but you don't need to hear about that.<br><br>Waiting for a release..ha! I don't even have time to take a good look at my lists at this point. I have stuff to do. If I trusted this system, I would get fired. If I blocked off time for work and put it on my calendar, I would have very little time for AF. I don't have anymore work than anybody else btw.<br><br>I LOVE AUTOFOCUS!! What a great way to live!! I wish I could live that way. Maybe if I had come from DIT and not GTD this would be a more organic shift, I don't know.<br><br>I don't want to give up THAT RELEASE, such a rush, such a dream, such a cool thing, but I would have to have another life if I were to wait for that.<br><br>It doesn't make sense to TRUST THE SYSTEM until real life and work intrudes--cause it does all the time---and then come up with a parallel system to cope with that, such as blocking off hours or all day. Occasionally okay, but with my life? My parallel system would take over my AF system. It has. It's kicked it's ass---LAST WEEK, THIS WEEKEND, THIS WEEK, THIS DAY.<br><br>Set me straight, any of you smart ppl. I would sincerely like that. Now..back to work!!</div>

Some of his recommendations flatly contradict Boice's, but they have quite a bit in common, too. I immersed myself in the system for a good period of time, and got good results, and I still use some of the things I learned from him. Of course, you might be wondering why I'm not still adhering to the whole system...I'm not sure, to be honest, and I'm too tired right now for self-analysis to be a good idea. Perhaps I'm just looking for a magic bullet.... <br><br>In any case, I'd definitely recommend Mundis's work.

<div class="content">I've been following this post with interest but didn't really feel qualified to get involved as a "non-writer".  I must admit I was thinking of writing along the lines of "choosing to be a writer" as opposed to the concept of writing for a thesis or as part of a course, where I can understand that there would be a considerable degree of resistance attached, but never considered that writing "by choice" would have the almost constant element of resistance that people have expressed.  I had always thought that writing should be fun, should just flow, and that writer's block was an occasional blip rather than a constant concern.  I found the point about separating the tasks of writing and editing very helpful - I can see that the latter would be more likely to have resistance attached.<br><br>I have mentioned before that I have always wanted to write a book or two - and have started that on occasion.  AF is encouraging me to revisit that wish to the extent that I have started to look seriously at the options.  The question I would like to ask - of those who write by choice (books, articles, blogs whatever) as opposed to more "obligatory" writing, is do you really find that the task of writing does become a chore, even though it is what you really want to do?  If so, is that because of deadlines imposed or some other reason?  For me, the concept of that type of writing has always been something that flows from my creativity (or not as the case may be!). My mother wrote numerous novels and loved to write so I guess there may be some sort of inherited disposition but I have never really questioned my "belief structure" vis-a-vis writing before and would be very interested in people's views on this.<br><br>The thing that really prompted this question was that this morning the task "Thinking Time" stood out, and I found myself starting to write just what I was going to use this time for.  Almost before I knew it, all of my thoughts just started flowing and what I produced was something I would be happy to look at as the start of a blog, an article, or even a book.  Out of curiosity I copied my writings into Word to do a word count - I set up my "Thinking Time" page at 11:04, made a cup of coffee before I started, and by the time I did my word count it was 11:41.  The number of words was 742 which surprised me given the daily numbers quoted above.  To me THAT is what I imagine writing SHOULD be like.  I'm certainly not saying that what I produced was a masterpiece or anything like that, but it was the way in which everything flowed so easily that I am curious about.<br><br>I would really value people's comments on this - thanks!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine, I have published a well reviewed book of ficition (NYT's Notable book of the Year, Summer Reading list, Michiko Kakutani review as well as a Sunday Book Review review) and teach in a grad writing program at a University. I know lots and lots of well known writers (fiction writers mainly) who have won almost every major literary award that can be given in U.S. and here's what we have to say about writing. If it's easy or fun, you aren't any good. Seriously, that's what the writer's I hang out with say. Everyone blood, sweats and tears through their books. But maybe that's why they are published, made into movies, make it into Best American Short Stories and all over the New York Times. That's why they teach at Harvard, win Guggenheims and Genius awards.<br><br>I say to my students that a writer needs utter emotional freedom to create, and then iron clad discipline to turn it into art and if you lack either one, you will not be a contender. It is all a competition. There are only so many publishers etc. However I find that the biggest competition is with yourself and that's where a lot of the fun is.<br><br>Also there is nothing more satisfying than a finished short story or a novel that lives on forever. First of all, you have done real work. You have done the very best that you can do and that is satisfying in and of itself. And I know, for me, that I will die much happier for having done the work that I do and have done.<br><br>Okay, I am a literary fiction writer, not a blogger or screenwriter so maybe they should weigh in as well and I am sure they will. I have written giant feature articles for the NYT's Magazine section and other magazines but it's not my thing. My think is fiction. love and kisses</div>

I have a friend who is a journalist -everything with him is fast, fast, fast -- and he tried to write a novel. It took him about two months and he was amazed at how bad it was.  I have another friend who is a novelist and each novel takes several years and they aren't even very long. But they're great.<br><br>In general, fiction seems to take longer than non-fiction.

<div class="content">Trish:<br><br>I like the Freudian typo ('my think is fiction'). Interesting post, anyway. I'm thinking about how to reconcile it with some of Boice's findings. Amongst other things, Boice has found that the more productive writers tend to be better at "moderating" negative emotions and negative thoughts – when thinking about writing or actually writing, they spend less time feeling bad, their bad feelings are less intense, and fewer of their thoughts are negative ("I'm talentless", "This is rubbish", "I'll never finish on time", etc.). He claims that the optimal state for writing is one of mild happiness, and claims that the most productive writers spend more time in such a state when writing. <br><br>At first sight, this might seem to be at odds with some of what you report ("If it's easy or fun, you aren't any good," "Everyone blood, sweats and tears through their books"). But perhaps not: perhaps what you're talking about is hard work and discipline – regular hours, lots of time and energy expended, lots and lots of revising and editing, etc. – which needn't be accompanied by suffering of the sort Boice is talking about – feeling depressed, hopeless, or anxious a lot of the time, lots of "negative self-talk". What do you think?<br><br>(And incidentally, the Boicean approach is completely on-board with "iron-clad discipline". One of his golden rules is daily sessions, and he recommends "contingency management" as a way of bringing that about, at least initially, until good habits are formed – not letting yourself shower/have coffee/check email/read the newspaper/<insert own desired daily activity> until after your writing session, giving a friend a cheque made out to a hated political organisation which he or she will mail if you don't stick to your writing schedule...that sort of thing.)<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Trish/Dave/Steve/Martin<br><br>Many thanks for your responses to my question.  There is a lot of food for thought there. I'm really quite motivated to explore this further but am not sure where it will lead.  I've written articles that have been well received so I know that is something I "can" do but it was not something I ever enjoyed - perhaps because it was more enforced than voluntary.  I "want" to write a book - non-fiction on subjects to do with Time Management and other organisation issues and have found, when I have started this before, that my thoughts flow relatively easily.  I've been told I have a good writing style but I believe that is always going to be relative.  I write in the style that I like to read for that type of book; in that genre there are so many different styles, some I like and some I don't.  However I would say without exception that each of those books will have had both excellent and terrible reviews.  People will either relate to a style of writing or they won't.<br><br>I would love to be able to write fiction but don't feel I would be very good at it.

<div class="content">Well, I tried writing first thing on both Friday and today. It didn't work for me :-(<br><br>Issues - on Fridays and Mondays I work from home. This means that I save an hour at the beginning of the day (8.30am to 9.30am) and then again in the evening (7pm-8pm) on commuting. That's four hours a week that I could very usefully spend on my DPhil before we even get to evenings and weekends.<br><br>But on Friday my husband, who'd been away all week on a business trip, came home earlier than expected and we ended up going out for a coffee. It wasn't a busy day workwise so I knocked off at 5pm (though I still had unimportant though nonetheless necessary tasks on my work AF list undone). HB and I went out to the cinema instead.<br><br>This morning, I got to my desk, remembered all the crappy work tasks I hadn't dealt with on Friday afternoon, thought I'd better get them out of the way before I started on my DPhil reading so I didn't have them hanging over me...and suddenly it was 9.45am and my clients were on the phone.<br><br>Some thoughts - <br><br>1) HB is a distraction when he's home, but a happy marriage is ultimately more important to me than the DPhil. But as a result of this natural prioritising, top priority is actually sabotaging second priority. <br><br>Ironically, my husband nags me about the DPhil constantly whenever I get sidetracked with any displacement activity, and was very dubious about me shutting up shop at 5pm.<br><br>2) I will do ANYthing, including the crappiest work tasks ever, before I will touch anything to do with my DPhil. Yet, as soon as I get started on the DPhil reading, I start loving it. All the resistance is in the anticipation.<br><br>Soooooo, can anyone help me stop all this displacement activity and persuade me to just get down to the job at hand???</div>

<div class="content">to little b:<br>try getting up a half hour earlier than usual.  use that extra half hour to do some reading or writing for your DPhil.<br><br>that's it.<br>see how this works for you.<br>then try it again the next day.<br><br>steve.<br><br>p.s. if a half hour feels like too much, try fifteen minutes.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">little b<br><br>From your comment "as soon as I get started on the DPhil reading, I start loving it" would seem to indicate that the "problem" with this task is not the task itself but some emotions surrounding it. Tasks of this nature can create a lot of emotion - the enormity of the task, the amount of time required, fear of failing, inability to do other tasks in the meantime - perhaps you could put a task on your list to "examine feelings about DPhil" and just brainstorm on that for a while - could be surprising .......<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Mark has it exactly right,little b. For me,  first thing means I get up, splash water on my face, make tea and sit at my writing desk. That is it. Any activity other than those three are deadly traps for avoidance  I conserve all my energy for the writing. No email. No radio. No Internet. No phone. No children. No wife. Just me and the work.  I make it as much of a regular ritual as possible. It is sacrosanct. Eventually it becomes habit.   When I do it this way, inspiration is abundant, the anxiety is minimal and I feel fantastic.    I suggest you start small and build up the time spent every day. Start with 10 minutes. Add ten minutes each day thereafter. It works.</div>

<div class="content">Hey!!!!!!!<br><br>It works!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>I took your collective advice last night (was reading the forum at bedtime which is why I didn't post), got up early, did nothing else but make myself tea, and worked solidly for 40 minutes.<br><br>So thank you all so much for moving me forwards! I guess I'll be trying chaining next...<br><br>...On which subject, would it be helpful if we had a separate thread on which we each "checked in" daily once we'd done some work on our writing project? Sort of like a Weightwatchers weigh-in, but with words written or minutes spent instead of pounds lost?</div>

<div class="content">DO IT FIRST!  Is a general principle that applies to anything.  If you have one task of any kind that you hate, do that first and the rest of the day sails.  What is it someone said: if you have to eat a dozen frogs today, eat the biggest one first.  Something like that ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Mike I do love your analogies:-)<br><br>i have to confess though that the frog analogy left me thinking "nooooo - I'd rather AF it and trust my subconscious to recognise when it was ready", i.e. all nicely cooked with garlic and mushrooms!</div>

<div class="content">Regarding the frog, the advice I have heard (but never taken) is to "eat a live frog,first thing every morning, and then nothing worse can happen to you for the rest of the day."</div>

<div class="content">little b,<br><br>I keep a log of how many minutes I've spent writing each day. I have a goal for the number of minutes spent writing for the year. Each day, after doing my writing, I enter the number of minutes for that day into the log.<br><br>That is one particular tactic that works for me. Below I've summarized some more general strategies. The more of them you do, the more you are likely to succeed.<br><br>1. schedule it<br>2. control your environment (no interruptions, no distractions [phone, internet], comfortable chair, usable work surface, handy reference materials )<br>3. monitor your progress (track minutes, or pages, etc.)<br>4. commit to others (create a thread on this website with your goal, and post to it daily telling us how you've done).</div>

<div class="content">Thank you all for the tips and support everyone.<br><br>On Moises's advice, I'm checking in to say that I have managed 68 minutes today - combination of working first thing and spending lunchtime usefully. Most I've done in a long time without an externally imposed deadline looming, so very happy.<br><br>Mark, your idea about tea being a reward has got me thinking. There is no way I can get up in the morning without the cup of tea - I am emphatically not a mornings person, so there's no way it can become my reward for working on my DPhil daily; I'd simply never get out of bed without it. <br><br>But the tea makes it possible to get up because I link drinking tea (something I love doing) to getting up (something I hate doing) and accordingly it "dilutes" the resistance to getting up. I only drink tea first thing though, so the thought of it each morning must be triggering some sort of Pavlovian response in me: if you want to drink tea, you have to get up.<br><br>So...if I can reduce resistance to a task by combining it with something I really enjoy doing, all I need to do now is think of an activity that can complement working on my DPhil.<br><br>But what activity could it be? You can't combine watching Coronation Street with completing your DPhil, more's the pity! <br><br>Music seems to be the obvious example but I'm not musical so I'm not sure whether it would be a good trigger to get me studying. Eating chocolate biscuits would definitely work, but probably wouldn't be very good for me :-(</div>

<div class="content">For years my morning ritual has been simple. Make coffee and start writing. By now, the very act of making the coffee seems to trigger my desire to sit down and start writing.</div>

<div class="content">little b<br><br>There's a book called Living a Beautiful Life by Alexandra Stoddard (link below) <br><br><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Living-Beautiful-Life-Elegance-Beauty/dp/0380705117/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1234379012&sr=1-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Living-Beautiful-Life-Elegance-Beauty/dp/0380705117/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1234379012&sr=1-1</a><br><br>which has some great ideas for creating rituals for events.  The one that always stuck in my mind was the story of a lady who hated doing her finances so made a ritual out of it by setting up a place to do it, using a fountain pen to write her cheques with coloured ink, having a vase of flowers on the table and music in the background.<br><br>When I used to travel in the States a lot I listend to a lot of "smooth jazz" radio stations and find that type of music makes a good unobstrusive background.  in fact one of the tasks on my AF list is to find a good station to listen to whilst working as I find it often helps my concentration.</div>

<div class="content">Just checking in to let everyone know that I'm still doing okay with the 'first thing' challenge. I've had a very hectic week and was away for the weekend, but I've still managed to do at least thirty minutes every day and some days I've managed a good couple of hours.<br><br>To help me on my way as discussed above, I have bought myself an obscenely expensive but utterly delicious-smelling Diptyque candle, and I light that whilst I write. No lighting the candle unless I'm writing. Stop writing, candle has to blown out.<br><br>I'm still struggling a little bit with putting the kettle on only when I'm working on the DPhil, as it's just too easy to cheat; tea has medicinal value as far as I'm concerned!  <br><br>Christine, thanks for the book recommendation. I haven't checked it out yet, but there's a reason for that: it's a truism that anyone studying for a DPhil will delay writing until they've finished reading, and they'll read anything to avoid writing. My new rule is that if it isn't directly relevant to the writing of my thesis, I won't read it. Not until the Easter holiday, anyway ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Oops, forgot to tell you about seeing the author Vikram Seth speak earlier this week. <br><br>For non-Brits, he wrote an epic novel in the 90s called 'A Suitable Boy' that is even longer than War & Peace (and arguably a much better read), as well as another very different novel, a biography, a travel guide, and a novel in rhyming couplets. So an awesome writer even if assessed only on productivity (though he's generally considered a genius on aesthetic grounds too).<br><br>Would you believe Seth regularly suffers from writer's block? And procrastination? And crippling self-doubt?<br><br>Currently he doesn't have a project, so he's painting instead. He said it was important to keep feeling creative and keep being productive so that you jam the vicious spiral of feeling blue because you're doing nothing, so doing nothing and feeling worse.<br><br>He also said that once you start writing, your ideas and characters will take on a life and a momentum of their own and you'll want to carry on writing just to see what happens next. The starting is the hard part (we could have told him that, right?)<br><br>Ironically, he also has an unfinished DPhil thesis!!</div>

<div class="content">I played with the idea how to write in small chunks, strictly using AF.

<div class="content">I know I'm coming late into this discussion, but I want to add another reccommendation for Boice/Silvia and writing at a scheduled hour. When I actually do so, it really works.<br>As for AF, when I started, I tried interspersing writing tasks, but quickly they got lost, so I started a notebook AF-style just for writing tasks. During my writing time, I process it using the AF rules to decide/remember what I want to write next.</div>
