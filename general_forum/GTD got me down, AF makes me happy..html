<div class="content">Hi All<br><br>Day 3 of AF.<br><br>GTD got me down, AF makes me happy. Does anyone else feel the same way?<br><br>I have to say a huge thank you to Mark for an inspired system. I am (was) a devoted GTDer and had already made the decision to move to a paper based system having struggled with OF, Things, RTM. I always felt overwhelmed by it and it only seemed to work for me on high energy days. On low energy days GTD used to get me down. I'd realise I hadn't looked at my next actions all day and I just couldn't trust the system.<br><br>AF has changed all that. I know it is going to work for me. Mark, you will be pleased to know I am using AF to the letter of your instructions without embellishments.<br><br>John</div>

<div class="content">I suscribe to the title line. AF makes me happy. And GTD is, although it has its merits and some true insights, like a heavy burden on the back.</div>

<div class="content">ITA, Johnners. I was good at "capturing" tasks but terrible at actually *looking* at my to do lists.<br><br>I love my AF list. I love the tactility of the paper, I love crossing out tasks, I love the "adventure" of going to a new page. I love the organic way tasks, large and small, are added, completed, dismissed. Most of all, I love that I actually review my list. I have a much better feel for the whole landscape of my life and work and I'm getting a much better balance between my *urgent* tasks and my long-term projects.</div>

<div class="content">I concur.  I have used GTD for a couple of years and still use many of the principles however where I failed was in the execution of tasks and getting things done!<br>The lists grew and grew, but I couldnt be motivated to complete the tasks.<br><br>MF's idea of the Closed List worked well, but I got tired of rewriting the tasks<br>day after day, and deciding which tasks to add from the master list to the<br>daily list.  I have been using AF for only 4 days but now I eagerly check<br>my AF notebook to see which tasks I can close off.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">uh, its a to-do list. I guess if you have never used one this is news to you. Lifehacker got me here; I read this all just amazed that anyone would be amazed at this system.</div>

<div class="content">Rick, sorry (for you), but you're missing the point.</div>

<div class="content">Rick:<br><br>If this is just a to-do list, has it occurred to you to wonder why so many people are posting about it, or why people have volunteered to translate it into eleven languages?</div>

<div class="content">To me, AF is like good project management skills. You can give a dozen people the same project. They'll all plug away at it. Most of them might even get it done before the deadline. But the one with the best project management skills will get it done faster, more efficiently, and with fewer headaches. Their results will probably be the best, too.<br><br>Anyone can make lists of things they will/want to/need to do. And, however they work from those lists, most people will get at least some of those things done. But AF gives you the skills to work from your list in a more efficient and effective way. <br><br>I've been using various TM systems (all of which tell you to keep lists of one kind or another) for quite a while. And AF (the easiest of the bunch) has helped me become more productive than any of those more complicated systems did.</div>

<div class="content">Rick,<br><br>Oh my...you really do need to study something at least a bit before making such a sweeping condemnation of Autofocus.  I am a professor at a major research university in the United States and lead a large research team.  I have NIH grants and consider myself somewhat successful.  I will tell you now that Autofocus is HARDLY just a to-do list!  I am using it to manage my very busy and stressful professional life (and personal life too althought that is not so stressful) and find it to be the best time management system I have ever used.  <br><br>Why don't you try it out for a while to see why so many world-wide are so positive about it?<br><br>And you are always welcome here....<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Spot on David. I immediately saw AF's potential. Last three days added 77, 87 and 61 items (typical days) and feel fully under control like never before. Go on Rick, give it a go.<br><br>John</div>

<div class="content">I second the title line. I have followed many sistems through the years to manage my busy work schedule. Now, going to paper and leaving my overpaid "task managent" softwares I am having really fun.<br><br>I have felt more productive in the last 2 weeks (since I start testing the system) than in all my past experiences.<br><br>It is NOT just a to do list...it is a system to focus almost magically your mind on your task.<br>As I would say in Italian, my mother tongue, "Meraviglioso e perfetto!" <br><br>All my appreciation to you, Mark<br><br>Mario</div>

<div class="content">I think in future, whenever anyone posts to this forum saying "It's just a to-do list", everyone else should just feign ignorance and pretend they agree: "Wait... wait... what? You mean writing down your tasks on a piece of paper isn't an original idea? Mark Forster is a CHARLATAN!"<br><br>It would be more fun that way.</div>

<div class="content">Well, whatever else this is, it's a lot more than just a to do list.  This is my second week into it and I must say I have never in my entire life been more productive, had more of a sense of control about my work and life and had more fun doing it.  I was an avid GTDer but it doesn't come close to this.  I tried to explain it to a colleague at work, but the simplicity of it was almost embarrassing. Please please please try it.</div>

<div class="content">i have used GTD for a year and AF for a week. AF is not a todo list. AF is incridible for it helps you to get everything undercontrol. GTD is different it's more a global way to think treat stuff and projects and to take control about your global life. GTD is realy great when you know how to do it and mainly if you made the work to organise your global life in a gtd way. AF is for the daily tasks it's  for me better than context just because it keep you right on the road focussing your energy on what you have to do. It interesting because it's help you to keep in action And it's easy. Nothing complicated. No computer. Just a notebook. Just try it and see.</div>

<div class="content">I have to concur with almost all the posters above.  I too am a convert from GTD, OF, et al and although I still use many of the suggestions in GTD (I still have a big inbox bucket for stuff by my computer) I just wasn't getting things done.  I would set up my context lists and skip around and do the things I always have done and skipped the things I always had skipped.  With Autofocus, I am doing more than I ever have.  I find myself doing SOMETHING, even if it is just a little, on things I used to skip--and I am finishing some of these things when I thought I might just spend a few minutes on them.  It is not just a to do list.</div>

<div class="content">Hi David (Drake).  I see from your reply to Rick that you have now sucessfully implemented AF after a couple of false starts.  What has been different this time?<br><br>Hi Rick, if you are still here.   If AF is just the a to-do-list dressed in the Kings new clothes, then that is fine by me because I feel better at work than I have in a long time and some tricky subjects are being dealt with before they become an embarassing crisis. <br></div>

<div class="content">Hi David W,<br><br>The big difference on why it has now been so successful...I have implemented the system entirely in a paper notebook.  It has made all of the difference in the world.  I have been more productive with AF in a simple spiral-bound notebook than I have ever been with any other system.  <br><br>-David</div>
