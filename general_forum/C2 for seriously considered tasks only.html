<div class="content">One of the things I have enjoyed about Mark's AF (and now SF) systems is that they seem like a relatively carefree way to manage work – flexible, intuitive, even fun. But the recent posts about having to finish Column 2 (C2) tasks and difficulties advancing through the pages made me realize that there is a critical point at which self-examination is essential when using the new SF system: the point of entering any task into C2 (urgent or unfinished).  With AF, I never felt too serious about anything except dismissal/review.<br><br>Before entering anything into C2, I will now ask myself this question: "Am I determined to finish this task in the near future?"  If my answer is No, then there is no point setting myself up for failure.  Either the new task isn't really urgent to me, or the unfinished task is doomed to remain so for a long time.  I'd rather manage finite-duration subtasks than have an endlessly continuing huge C2 task (e.g. "Get my Ph.D." or "Read _War and Peace_").<br><br>I can still enter anything into C1 – badly worded, vague, stupid – but I must be careful about what gets into C2.</div>

<div class="content">This seems to be true, yes.  <br><br>But I am often wondering, if the precise wording guideline is given too much emphasis, how it changes the whole dynamic of "capture whatever you want" in Column 1, and then the "take action on whatever stands out" idea.   Then if that task is NOT DONE, it goes into Column 2.  Those are the basic rules, and they are very liberating.  <br><br>The rules don't say anywhere HOW to write a task, or that you must be very careful what you allow to get into Column 2.   All of that discussion has come later, in the forums, and in the "SF Tips".  <br><br>Of course all of those tips and helps are useful.   And your asking yourself that question, "will I finish this in the near future", can be a good practice.  But for me, the basic rules and original AF concepts are the most important part of the system.  I'd rather intuit my way through it, and say "This C2 task really seems DONE FOR NOW", rather than be forced to word the task precisely ahead of time or get stuck in an unending C2 loop.   That just creates too much stress and takes away from the natural flow of the system.  For me, at least. <br><br>This approach -- NOT worrying overmuch about how things are worded before they get into C2 -- has actually been working great for me -- things are progressing, things are getting done.</div>

<div class="content">I actually think you can look at it the other way. If it's on your list at all it's because you want to do it. And the magic of SF is that when you start working on it, you will find that having it in C2, having an incentive to work on it little and often, mixing it up with other tasks, you end up getting that stuff done that you would normally put off. (however it is also possible to ignore your entire list altogether, but that is another issue altogether)<br><br>That's why I'm somewhat skeptical of the need to take things off of C2 because they're not a "priority". If you want it to be done at some point, what's the harm in getting a good head start on it. Managing everything by most urgent first just leads to everything being done at the last minute. I think Mark says something like that in "Do It Tomorrow" where he suggests doing things "least urgent first".</div>

<div class="content">According to Mark, SuperFocus focuses on finishing. In that sense, the most important way of avoiding Column 2 is to *finish* whatever you start, as soon as possible. In other words, one way of understanding "Column 2 pain" is as punishment for multitasking too much.<br><br>In my opinion, if you resist a system that wants to force you to reduce (excessive) multitasking, SuperFocus may not be for you. It will either inflict pain and resistance, or you will tweak the system until you're back to AutoFocus anyway.<br><br>On the other hand, excessive multitasking is inefficient. Mark has posted little ascii diagrams about how your average time from task entry to result can suffer from multitasking.</div>

<div class="content">Ubi, I quite agree. And Good post, Marcus. <br><br>Don, important consideration there, but I don't think the problem is there. <br><br> I observe that it's not only C2 items that get worked on, but also a variety of tasks from each page. Those go little and often. By the time you finish 5 big tasks by focusing them in c2, you will also have worked 39 other tasks, and some of those multiple times and with significant progress on them.  All this in the breaks between your primary tasks.</div>
