<div class="content">Hi Folks, I'm doing an ILM (Institute of Leadership and Management) course, and they are very keen on setting SMART objectives.  I recall Mark writing about the limitations/problems of this approach, but I can't now find it.  Can anyone point me towards a reference or link for this? <br>Thanks very much!</div>

<div class="content">Basically what I've said about SMART goals is that the only thing wrong with them is that they are deadly dull. <br><br>No one is going to get super-motivated by "Raise the department's sales by 4% by the end of the first quarter."</div>

<div class="content">In "Secrets of Productive People" on page 82:<br><br>"This is an important distinction because goals are frequently made too specific at too early a stage. This is one of the problems with SMART goals."<br><br>p. 151<br><br>"… you should only define your destination in enough detail to guide your action in the present."<br><br>"A SMART goal may be very effective for getting a team to a predetermined result, but it is not effective for encouraging creativity and initiative from individuals."<br><br>The book is worth the read IMHO for the various subjects on "goals" alone.</div>

<div class="content">Christopher:<br><br>Thanks for quoting that passage. Being deadly dull is of course what happens when you remove creativity and initiative out of the equation.</div>
