<div class="content">In my work as a consultant, my main issue is to organize and set priorities in my work. The concepts in the book are quite familiar to me and it's nice to see that this system does work, also for others.<br><br>I instead try to do all thins today. I try not to plan anything in the afternoon and reserve this time to do all incoming things. By doing these things, which are mostly not urgent or important, I hold my empty agenda and mailbox, and I can respond quickly. This gives me a greaf feeling of calmness and satifaction.<br><br>As a consequence, I sometimes work a bit longer and sometimes a bit shorter (which is quite a strange notion when you realize there in no more work), but for me this works really well.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for your comment, Andy. It seems to me that you are basically using the "Do It Tomorrow" system, but your "day" runs from midday to midday, rather than from midnight to midnight.<br><br>It sounds as if it's working well for you. I'd be interested to hear from anyone else who tries out doing it this way.<br><br>Mark</div>

<div class="content">Midday to midday, hmmmm perhaps this is the way I need to think.  I read DIT quite a while ago and tried using it, but my attempt was not full hearted.  Being in customer service, my primary role is to answer their needs as soon as possible, so I was never fully at ease with the tomorrow approach - tricky enough to convince fellow workers, not something to try on customers.  Sure, there are some things non customer related, but it seemed there was too little left in my day to try and manage with this approach. Perhaps thinking in this timeframe would help this to be more workable in my situation. I suppose my planning time would then be right after the noon meal, and would cover that afternoon and the next morning.  That might work for much more of my tasks.</div>
