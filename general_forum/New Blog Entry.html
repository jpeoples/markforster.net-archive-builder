<div class="content">Mark just wanted to cheer you on. I thought your DIT book was brilliant so an update would be grand. One question I have is whether your adaptation would make DIT work for someone like me who has work come in to my head rather than my inbox. I failed quickly to be able to address one day's brain dump the next day. Will we have to filter tasks to include only the imperatives or does it allow for home and recreational tasks also? I am still listless LOL but will give DIT2 a go for fun.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>Sorry, but just a quick edit check:<br><br>>>> How does DIT now compare to AF? Well, it’s now seems to be as responsive as AF <<<<br><br>Should be: "...Well, it now seems ..."<br><br>You must be slaving long and hard over a long list ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Mike. I picked up the error when I sent out the newsletter version of the article but forgot to change the original.</div>

<div class="content">Mel:<br><br><< One question I have is whether your adaptation would make DIT work for someone like me who has work come in to my head rather than my inbox. >><br><br>Well, I'll be interested to see how you find it. The new automatic "audit procedure" works well (so far) at sorting these sort of things out for me. Like you, most of the things on my list have come from myself rather than other people.</div>

<div class="content">I find it interesting that, as a general statement, people that comment on Mark's blog entries are often a different group than those posting in the forum.  I suppose that's why Mark posted his pre-announcement to the blog and the email list -- to rouse the prodigal sons and daughters only following his RSS feed.<br><br>Boo to the forum that has no RSS! :-)</div>
