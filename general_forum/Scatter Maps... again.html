<div class="content">Curious if anyone is still using Mark Forster's Scatter Maps? Something I've been trying... whenever I have a discretionary time, I create a Scatter Map in my paper journal. It's all stream of consciousness stuff... a task here, an update there. And then I choose one thing that stands out and do that. I do some work, then update my journal about progress, next steps, etc, and then create another Scatter Map.<br><br>Mark's original idea was to create a Scatter Map in the morning. That idea worked for me, well enough that I'm applying it throughout my day. <br><br>Added bonus: All of the stuff that appears in my various Scatter Maps are captured/stored for safe keeping. So nothing gets lost. This has an organizing and calming effect for me, even thought the Scatter Map process feels intuitive and not linear i.e. Daily to-do list. <br><br>Scatter Map reference: <a href="../blog/The Scatter Map.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2016/5/19/the-scatter-map.html</a></div>

<div class="content">Here's a nice reference to scatter maps in the ether, and a nice compliment to Mark. <br><br><a href="http://www.mandalastressrelief.com/blog/2017/4/27/a-stress-free-way-to-journal-scatter-mapping" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.mandalastressrelief.com/blog/2017/4/27/a-stress-free-way-to-journal-scatter-mapping</a></div>
