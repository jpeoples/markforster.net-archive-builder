<div class="content">Mark, this is my first post in this forum and before I do so, let me thank you and everybody else on this forum to provide such a breath of insight related to the subject of time management. Your insights have been invaluable to me.<br><br>I've been using AF for a month now and wanted to comment on a slight change to the AF List that has provided a larger sense of close list to the AF system<br><br>I use AutoFocus for unscheduled tasks and daily tasks as instructed by Mark but added an additional element: I will add the starting date of each page in the top section and add the “last date” to the bottom of the page (the date the last item was added to the page). I will then decide how many days it should take me to complete the page (based on the pace of my job, I’ve found that adding 5 days from the “last date” keeps the pace of my work highly competitive. I will write that date in the top right corner of the page and it will become my commitment date. I don’t allow pages to “mature” on the same dates. I will use AF to manage my daily tasks but I will also commit to complete each page at a certain date. I am still allow to dismiss tasks or use the “little and often” principle to move forward projects. <br><br>I added the additional element to Mark’s AutoFocus to add more “closure” to each individual AF page. I was concern about missing some of the discipline DIT provided with the idea of getting a day's workload done in one day. I realize this is not 100% AutFocus but it adds that good feeling of setting goals to my workload and achieving it, something I will always be grateful for Mark’s DIT model.<br><br>AJ</div>

<div class="content">Hi AJ,<br>I like the idea - in theory - of basically providing a 5 day turnaround for work items - sort of a "do it next week" instead of do it tomorrow.  Are you using this method for both work and home / personal items?<br>For now, I'll stick with plain vanilla AF though as I am in an environment which is highly dependent upon others who seem to take a long time to get around to doing things.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-03-3 0:14</div>
<div class="content">Jacqueline,<br><br>Actually, I am using this approach with both lists (office & personal). With the personal lists the turnaround is longer. I find this approach particularly useful for my personal items as I tend to procrastinate more (ask that to my wife!!)</div>
<h2>Reply by Marc (from Brussels)</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-03-3 15:16</div>
<div class="content">I see one important practical problem with this approach, which occurs when you use the little and often approach. Even though your initial entry may be on a page with a limit date, as soon as you did some work on an item it's rewritten on a later page, thus effectively moving it out of its initial date range and into a new one. I'm frequently rewriting entries over a lot of pages before a subject reaches its conclusion. I hope I'm making myself clear...</div>

<div class="content">I agree with Marc's comment.  I have found that adding any further elements to the system disrupts the flow in that they impose a rationality on the item as to it's urgency and importance.<br><br>Two specific thoughts come to mind on this point.  Firstly, if I list everything, without grading, I am finding that my subconscious instinctively sorts the "real" urgency and importance within the amazing degree of flexibility arising from doing what I want when I want.  If I have say 50 items which will take 10 hours to do and impose some sort of order on them so specifying which are completed first, then at the end of 10 hours those 50 items will be completed.  If I use "pure" AF at the end of 10 hours those 50 items will still be completed.  However the second process will have been a lot more enjoyable than the first (and the likelihood is that there would have been increased resistance with the first and perhaps only 49 items are completed as a result!)<br><br>The second thought will sound rather strange ........ on more occasions than I would have expected, an item that I would have prioritised but have not actioned has turned out to have different requirements by the time I reach it.  Conversely on occasions when I have allowed myself to be influenced by the "need" to prioritise, the task has subsequently turned out to be unnecessary and therefore "wasted" time.  There is no way my subconscious could have been aware of the factors in advance so why (and how!) did AF "get it it right"?  Strange ........</div>

<div class="content">Christine:<br><br><<There is no way my subconscious could have been aware of the factors in advance so why (and how!) did AF "get it it right"???<br><br>Gavin de Becker in "The Gift of Fear" deals with many examples of the type of clues that the subconscious mind picks up on that the conscious mind is unaware of. People often say "there is no way that I could have known that", but nevertheless on further examination it becomes apparent that the clues were there, and were picked up.</div>

<div class="content">Christine<br>When you're in the mood, google rehicular activating system and ideo motor response.  We're genetically encoded to pick up and process this stimuli.  Unfortunately, we are socially brainwashed/taught to ignore....hence losing our awareness that we're doing this automatically.  Worse, we're often taught to blatently disregard our resultant emotional response to our processing these stimuli!  It's rather fascinating (and reassuring)<br>gsdsmiles</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine B.<br><br>one more and I'll stop.....this is just to infuse you with a bit of curiosity.<br>The reticular activating system employs both your conscious and subconscious mind to call up any relevant info/knowledge to your attention......both factual and the beliefs you regard as facts/expectations/values, etc  Stated another way, it has a starring role in implementing autofocus!

<div class="content">Hi learning as I go<br><br>OK I'm curious ...... :-) I'll certainly look that up - I've heard the term before but cannot recall specifics so will research further.  I do believe that our subconscious knows and identifies a lot more than we realise ........<br><br>With ref to the comments above I was thinking of three specific car related incidents - 1) I had been following a car on the motorway/freeway for some time when I "knew" the luggage strapped to the roof was going to come off and braked beforehand.  I can accept that my subconscious somehow saw something that I didn't and prompted me to avoid an accident. 2) Similar scenario - was overtaking a truck and "knew" it's load was about to fall and pulled back beforehand.  Again I can believe my subconscious processed the weather factors and the wind that consequently caught the truck, but 3) I had a premonition of a car accident for three weeks before a car pulled out into the side of me - totally not my fault and I cannot see any way in which my subconscious could have picked up on that one .....</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine<br>I'm certainly no Ph.D. or M.D. but I had to learn about this via my job and pstd therapy also.  Basicially, RAS filters stimuli to your awareness in reference to info that has value to what you're focused on......yet.....It's genetically encoded to over-ride and take over your attention and set your body to react to real (or thought to be real) perils or potential perils.  The house is on fire, you drop everything and run to your child's room all the while screaming to warn everybody in the house.  <br>example for imagined threat: unfounded guardedness stemming from jealousy.  Maybe the woman is flirting with your guy or maybe she has the looks that your guy responds HIGHLY to.....<br>see....<br>RAS also makes you suddenly notice things that might advance your goals.<br>Don't mistake the conincidental phenomena with actual RAS functions.  It collates data by juxtaposing it against your interests/needs.......survival data trumps all!  LOL!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">oops...I forgot regular example.  You're at a banging, loud party yet you're able to filter out the crowd noises and music enough to carry on a conversation.  Even though, RAS has reduced the sounds to a background din, the decibels of the voices vary little.  You're focused on the conversation and your awareness would be flooded if too much external stimuli were brought to your awareness.  However, you suddenly can discern the music because they are playing your favorite song of all time......<br>You're in the market to buy a new auto of a particular make.  Suddenly, you see them everywhere.  This isn't a gift from the universe telling you that you made a wise choice.  They were there all along....you didn't notice them before because you had to need or interest to notice them before.........Now, you see them everywhere.  That's RAS!  LOL!  If you confuse the two, you stand to become superstitious!  LOL<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">More from Gavin de Becker:<br><br>My favorite quote of his is:<br><br>"Intuition is the journey from A to Z without stopping at any other letter along the way. it is knowing without knowing why."<br><br>Other favorites:<br><br>"Intuition is usually looked upon by us thoughtful Western beings with contempt. It is often described as emotional, unreasonable, or inexplicable. *** We much prefer logic, the grounded, explainable, unemotional though process that ends in a supportable conclusion. In fact, Americans worship logic, even when it’s wrong and deny intuition, even when it’s right."<br><br>"Many experts lose the creativity and imagination of the less informed. They are so intimately familiar with known patterns that they may fail to recognize or respect the importance of the new wrinkle. The process of applying expertise is, after all, the editing out of unimportant details in favor of those know to be relevant."<br><br>"Intuition is a gift we all have, whereas retention of knowledge is a skill. Rare is the expert who combines an informed opinion with a strong respect for his own intuition and curiosity. Curiosity is, after all, the way we answer when intuition whispers, 'There’s something there.'"<br><br>My two cents:<br><br>We are smarter and more effective (as well as more creative) when we are able to access our logic *and* our intuition.</div>

"<br><br>Just some possible ways in which your intuition might have subconciously picked up on something like this (I'm not saying any of these actually applied in this situation):<br><br>You noticed someone having a near miss and realised how easily it could happen to you.<br><br>You noticed that the markings at that junction were becoming very worn<br><br>You had noticed that the local authority wasn't repairing the roads properly any longer - that's certainly the case around where I live!<br><br>You'd noticed an increase of cars driving without due care and attention on your route.<br><br>You'd had several near misses with people using mobile phones illegally.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark<br><br>Yes I can see how such stimuli could cause one's subconscious to act/react differently.  I don't think any of them were applicable in that specific situation which was pretty weird to say the least.  It was quite bizarre to have a car accident and for the overwhelming feeling to be relief that it was now over!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Learning ;-)<br><br>Another good example of the RAS in action is when you play with your cat (WHAT?  You don't HAVE a cat?  OMG! ;-)  You don't move the toy slowly ... the cat simply ignores that.  But if you move it in quick jerky movements, the cat perks right up and is in attack mode.  It is wired that way because it's typical prey is small quick voles, mice and such.  So that wiring makes quick jerky movements irresistible to it.  Survival!<br><br>Also, if you notice cats have two kinds of sleep.  One where they are totally sacked out, but another where they are "drowsing".  In that second type you'll see their ears tracking random sounds.  Should there be a high pitched (read squeaky) sound, no matter how low the volume, the ears will track it and if it meets the threshold the RAS will pop the cat right out if its drowse and it will be flying through the air to catch the mouse ;-)  Again, survival!</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>I always wondered why my German Shepherd/wolf mix was so daft acting when she had to relieve herself....especially her stools.  Well, it snowed a LOT here....and I got both answers!  LOL!  The reason she keeps rotating in circles is to clear a path so that she scares off snakes and rodents hidden and.......to mash the snow so that she won't freeze her jewels or you can guess the other obvious reason.  She LOVES the snow!  Her  "wolfen" webbed paws and heavily furry belly (ALL domestic dogs have much less hair on their undersides unlike a wolf) come in handy in this record breaking cold.

<div class="content">Hi Learning,<br><br>Cats Names:<br><br>- Laffee (for Lafayette -- don't ask me, she came with that name and you KNOW that you would never change a cat's name ;-)  She died two years ago of hypothyroid disease, but she was about 17 or so.  She was adopted from a vet because a family had a new child and she was a problem.  She was a more sedate cat and did not like her ears and tail pulled.<br><br>- Fitz (for Fitzgerald -- named for the Fitzgerald rec center in Philadelphia where my wife worked teaching tennis one summer).  He also goes by the alias "Fitzdini" for his uncanny ability to escape if you don't get the door shut quickly enough.  He was a rescue from that rec center where some kids found him and kept him inside.  I'm sure he loved the attention but he also loved having his own family.  He is a real tom's tom and defines the term "catitude".<br><br>- Next came Bubba (well, that name describes him well) a gentle giant.  Also called Uncle Bubba because he protected the kittens and sometimes Bubbles because he screams like a little girl when Fitz attacks him, though he is easily twice his size and three times his weight!)  He was a rescue from a Chinese restaurant in Manhattan where he was locked in the dark basement.  (He was well treated and it was warm and dry, but alone in the dark ... a horrible existence for a cat.  He hated being rescued ... yelled all the way back from NYC to D.C. ... but loves it now that he roams free in a big house with lots of windows and other cats to chase him.  ;-)<br><br>- Then, came the twins, Thelma and Louise.  (You can guess how they behaved by those names).  They were a rescue from some dumb people who thought they would make a fortune breeding cats!  !! !!! !!!!  Alas, Thelma just died this fall of liver disease ... she was only four.  It hit me pretty hard because she was so bonded to me.  Louise continues on as the alpha cat in the house ... even as a kitten she used to take names and kick ass.  Now she no longer bothers taking names ;-)<br><br>- Finally came Rory (short for Rorschach because of the big blotchy swirling black patterns of her coat).  She was a rescue from my wife's friend who when she had a baby, Rory started acting out and had to go.  She's been wonderful for us ... though a bit needy.  A real lap cat.<br><br>That's the gang.  Four now, and we will probably not change that number too much.  We had five before we lost Thelma and that was bordering on insanity.  Four is a bit easier, but it still sometimes looks like a Marx Brothers movie around here.  My wife says she draws the line at being the woman in the house on the corner with six cats!  Five, O.K., but not six!  <foot stomping>  LOL ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Learning,<br><br>We got a "captains bed" at long last.  It is a huge thing and has cubbyholes at the head for clocks, water bottles, Klenex boxes, glasses, etc.  In the morning, when food time is near, Fitz wanders across us and settles in my cubby (he knows it is useless to try to wake my wife) and sits there, looking at me, purring.  That closed space amplifies the purr to the level of a buzz saw!  LOL ;-)<br><br>It is also kind of funny to notice that which member of the group is delegated to wake me in the morning.  I have this vision of them calling a meeting to order in the morning, whipping their agendas out of their inside breast pockets, and deciding who's turn it is to get the food guy up ;-)<br><br>But yeah, kitty slobber is one of life's little pleasures ... and stepping in fresh barf in one's bear feet in the early morning's dark as well ;-)<br><br>And the launch pad ... that goes on all of the time and I get victimized every time.  Rory is too subtle for me when she is ready to launch ... some cats will take a while ... measure the distance ... wiggle their butts and swish their tails as they fine tune the launch ... but Rory just launches with no preamble and it knocks the wind out of me every time.<br><br>I have tried explaining AF to my cats but they just stare at me, yawn, stretch, and go back to drowsing.  It is probably that they don't have lists of avoided tasks ... when it is time to eat, they yell for food.  When it is time to sleep, they just do it.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine<br>I shouldn't be here right now...*blush* so I rushed the answer.  Of course, the RAS doesn't need to work nearly as hard when you're asleep because it's not processing external stimuli......it's thought that the brain processes both your events and concerns while you are sleeping.  Researchers also believe that a component of children needing so much extra sleep is also related to them needing to learn so much about their world...much less "been there:done that" for a child's mind!

We also got one of those foam mattresses.  Like Temperpedic but not that brand.  It is the greatest.  One of us can do the macarana on our side and the other not feel a thing.  I love those drawers under it.  I wish there were more ... eight is not enough, in this case ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Christine,<br><br>In NLP parlance that is called "anchoring".  It can be quite arbitrary, or planned.  When planned it can be a powerful tool.  When arbitrary it is responsible for all kinds of mischief, like phobias or PTSD.<br><br>It is also used by political organizations to good effect.  Think of how churches use it.  You walk into an imposing structure made of stone, it is cold inside, your footsteps echo on the walls, sunlight streams in through stained glass in a circus of color, you smell the burning wax, the incense.  You hear the music.  Every sense is assaulted in a UNIQUE way to lock you into the experience ... and the MESSAGE.<br><br>Damn they knew what they were doing ;-)</div>

<div class="content">@Seraphim - Not only is my cat named Fluffy, but my dog's name is Sparky (ok, his real name is Spartacus - but it totally doesn't suit him (golden retriever=non-stop play - and he's not an opressed slave in a brutal aristocracy - unless the cat is the aristocracy)!</div>

<div class="content">Christine<br><br>Going back to the accident you foresaw, it is interesting how much resistance there is to accepting the obvious explanation, that you had a premonition. This could also explain the other cases. Cars and trucks often look dangerously overloaded but you were aware of those particular ones.<br><br>Think back - have you had other such experiences in your life? And can you be sure the beautiful view you described does not exist? You might get to see it for real one day.<br><br>Any rational attempt at explanation involves a certain amount of hand waving. Rather like trying to explain AF to cats.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike<br><br>Yes, anchoring is a great tool for motivation and I think it is a great way to create the right environments for working.  Funny, I was just having an email exchange with someone on that very subject yesterday.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Laurence<br><br>I have no problem in believing that there are things that happen that are beyond rational explanation.  Sure my subconscious could have picked up signals in a couple of the instances but that doesn't seem likely in the three week premonition.  I do believe in a God who works supernaturally which certainly can include warnings of dangerous situations.</div>

<div class="content">I personally believe that premonitions are entirely possible.<br><br>But I think most of them are just random events.  I am thinking especially about all the premonitions we have that turn out to be false alarms.  Maybe we remember the premonitions that come true, because they come true, and it seems so astonishing.  Kind of like running into an old friend in a strange place where you had no expectation at all of meeting someone you know.  You remember it, and think it is astonishing, but when you consider that math of such encounters it really isn't all that astonishing.<br><br>Reminds me of the man who predicted the 1974 stock market decline (which he now widely trumpets).  Problem is, he predicted the same thing in 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1972, and 1973 -- but never tells you about those failures.  Everyone remembers his 1974 prediction -- it was uncannily accurate.  But really not so uncanny -- even I could predict "The stock market will shoot up 25% this year!!"   If I say it for enough years, eventually I'll be a prophet.<br><br>The book by Nicholas Nasim Taleb "Fooled By Randomness" explores this phenomenon on many levels, though it's mostly an investment book.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fooled_by_Randomness" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fooled_by_Randomness</a></div>
