<div class="content">In another thread, Beth asked:<br><br><Some ideas might be (and all issues of mine, btw):<br>* Techniques for staying focused when you get off-track. Ideas for getting back on? For not getting off in the first place?><br><br>Depends what causes us to 'fall off the wagon' I suppose.<br><br>The thread 'Are you getting things done' made me realise some things, almost always break activities, too easily displace others and burn up discretionary time.<br><br>What I'm now trying to do is confine these activities to 'hard breaks' which means I take them at a specific time and time limit them.<br><br>I'd like to hear other ideas about staying on track, I'm still not so good at getting back on track so I'd love to hear about these too.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Smiley<br>Yeah, I sound like a broken record.  Timeboxing and the Timer coupled with mind manipulation...... and several doses of kick ass determination.....over and over and over....until you're satified enough for the day. For me, it's coping not cure.  I always have to apply meself to get boring things done.  *blush*  but it's worth the extra application of effort to keep my mind open for better work and pleasures without the nag factor polluting my mind.  <br>For scut, I timebox the max of it to force good decisions and prevent busy work.  I call it my scut cap.  The first thiry minutes I devote to what will give me the great peace of mind.  That helps to both knock out the scut and get jazzed for the exciting and/or important work.<br>Current Initiative is great for getting things started and working out the kinks, wrapping up projects, learn something new, etc...<br>About 90% of my system is self-management.  *sigh*<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>Bottom line: Formulate your aims with flexibility built in and keep getting back on the horse each time you fall off until you reach your destination. <br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">I haven't mastered the subject but I have found the timed interval trick helps.  If I'm of a mind to do something, but also intimidated by that thing, I tried using a timer.  Work 5 minutes.  (Anybody can do 5 minutes, it gets you started.)  Break 5 minutes.  (Clean up stuff maybe, or find some tunes.) Work 10 minutes.  Break 5.  Work 15, break 5, work 20, break 5, work 25, break 5, work 25, break 5, work 25, break  5.  (25 is a plenty long interval without break.), work 15 (getting weary), break 5, work 10 break 5, work 5, stop.<br><br>Result is more than 2.5 hours of hard work, effectively the same as 3 or 4 hours of non-stop work because you slow down when you don't stop, and this is work I really was reluctant to start.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for starting this thread, smileypete. It was on my list to do :~)<br><br>I love to create reference lists for something like this. Then when I come up against the issue at hand, rather than going through a bunch of posts, I have a quick list to refer to. <br><br>To that end I thought I would start one here, using these great suggestions:<br><br>On staying focused:<br>1.	Stay determined. Apply yourself (over and over). [learning as I go]<br><br>2.	Use timers and time-boxing (?) to create periods of doing task x. [learning as  go]<br><br>3.	Get those tasks you least want to do done as early as possible, so that you can use as an incentive the knowing that you have more enjoyable tasks coming up once they’re completed. [learning as I go]<br><br>4.	Use Current Initiatives to stay focused. [learning as I go]<br><br>5.	Use specific timed intervals. Ex.: 5 mins-work, 5 mins break, 10 mins work, 5 mins break, etc. [Alan Baljeu/smileypete]<br><br>6.	If the distractions just keep recurring, look at WHAT is distracting you more carefully. (Does it need doing? Does it need ignoring?) [smileypete]<br><br>Learning, Alan, smileypete—how’d I do? Edits welcome.<br><br>Any further ideas/suggestions/additions welcome. <br><br>I will add a couple of my own later.<br>~Beth</div>

<div class="content">Hi Beth<br>This may not apply to you but my spirit of intentionality is a bit different.  I keep the scut corralled and get it off my plate only partially for the reason you mentioned....looking forward to better work and pleasures ahead.  But my strongest motive is because I want my mind with as few negative distractions (the nagging) as possible to create a better mental environment for creative flow.<br><br>Secondly, I advocate for flexibility blended into my work day for obvious reasons.  I also am flexible with the duration of timed bursts based on the anxiety or physical pain levels to set the timer.  If the anxiety or pain I'm experienceing is high, I'm OK with setting it to 5 minutes.  If I'm taking a mid day break, I set it for an hour.  The timer method can both launch work and restrict it.  It also restricts break times.<br>YVMV<br>learning as I go<br><br>p.s.  I plan weekly so I have great flexibility to meet my aims.  I have firm round -up days to complete things when I'm using little and often.  Example:  Accounts round-up day is Friday.  I can use chunk s of the previous days to whittle it down but come Friday, I've got to have it done.....hopefully earlier.  I aim for staying current but prefer being a bit ahead in service of flexibility while meeting my responsbilities and aims.</div>

<div class="content">learning--thanks for the great ideas and clarification. <br>So do you mind if I take a stab at editing some and making this an item on the above list? <br><br>The thing with me is that there is all this great help here, and then when I really "need" it, I have trouble finding it. So, I thought a list would be good. And of course, I can always do this on my own (which I have done in the past) just thought others might benefit from this format as well.<br><br>~Beth</div>

<div class="content">Hi Beth<br>Do as you will with it.  I offer it with no rules!  LOL!<br>I, too, have  created a reference book with notes, quotes, games and techniques to spice things up or sharpen my focus and determination,  etc when I need to manipulate my mind to help me get my work done or set up a creative environment.  I'll do whatever it takes.  Like you, it's easier to have these things at the ready for those times that we need the assistance.<br>vickie</div>

<div class="content"><Learning, Alan, smileypete—how’d I do? Edits welcome.><br><br>Very well munchkin ;~)<br><br>Looks like 'learning' uses timeboxing on stuff she'd rather not do so as to focus beyond it on better things.<br><br>On the other hand I try and timebox distractions i tend to spend tooo much time on.<br><br>Something I sometimes do similar to the 'salami slice' technique Alan mentioned, is to start with a short (eg. 5 min) task, then pick a bit longer one (eg 10m), then a longer one (15m) and so on. <br><br>This means a few tasks get ticked off quite quickly which is a good for morale.</div>

<div class="content">Smileypete's mention of the Salami Technique is a good reminder, you just have to do the arithmetic to workout how the total time can build up.<br><br>I use this technique for bigger jobs, the size of which may have been daunting me.  The Salami Technique for me gets me into a groove from the time the first 5 minute buzzer goes (I use a digital kitchen timer if at home, else a computer timer like CoolTimer), it's like I've cleared the first hurdle.<br><br>My problem is sometimes knowing when to stop as progress seems to get faster and somehow easier (all in the mind?).  My record spell was from 5 minutes to a final one of 55 minutes = 275 minutes without a break.  Did I feel good and pleased with progress!<br><br>I have not used the technique to do several tasks in a session, maybe that's something to try out.</div>

<div class="content">Hi RogerJ<br>Yeah, using the timer works great for bundling tasks also.  My meta time is bundling the scut and it's usually comprised of various units of time to make the whole.  If my physical condition allows, I can hyperfocus on interesting work for very long stretches....but the scut.....I need the timer to keep launching my efforts until I'm done. I don't need any help with the satisfying and challenging work.....but that scut requires effort almost every time!  LOL!<br>275 minutes is outstanding!  If I accomplished that with my scut, I'd be dancing in the streets!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Hi Smileypete<br>Yeah, I use the timer to set limits on distraction as well especially when I find myself desperately looking for an escape hatch!  LOL!  But, alas, I've fallen into cyber black holes more often than I care to admit!  *blush*  I hate that it creates a sensation of working overtime when I have to catch up to meet my aims!  I suppose that since I have a maximum stopping time for work, I feel as though I doubly cheated myself when I steer off the rails. When the clock says that I aught to be well past finished yet I'm catching up, I feel like a dunce because I shot myself in the foot......again!  When I KNOW that I'm experienceing monkey mind, I can head it off at the pass but that little monkey can be a tricky little fellow!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Just coming back to this, I'm now beginning to think the best way to stay focused is to /practice/ staying focused, at ALL times - unfortunately :~)<br><br>This means ALWAYS rounding up distractions onto some sort of 'grasscatcher' list, then coming back to them later in a break period and picking a few to look at. <br><br>Even then while doing so, if something else interesting comes up, it gets added back on the grasscatcher. So NO aimless web surfing for example.<br><br>Wonder if it's another one of those things where the price of freedom is eternal vigilance?<br><br>Any thoughts? Is this a bit extreme?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Smily Pete<br>Well....I'd be frazzled if I practiced 24/7 vigilence!  Plus, when you're in the flow or simply engaged with satisfying work or outright pleasures, vigilence would be a total buzz kill and stifle both creative output and natural satisfaction.  For me, I'm only vigilent when I KNOW that I'm doing scut.  Once I've done the prescribed scut for the day, I can turn off the work cop in my brain.  Engaging work would be ruined by self-conscious monitoring.  That's the REASON I get it done early, so I can enjoy the challenging work and my leisure time. YMMV<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>Some of my best work was incubating during periods of my drift factor....LOL!  I believe that if our intentions are guileless, our minds will guide us appropriately for the most part.  Problem solving and creative interaction with work needs a bit of hang loose thinking, yeah?<br>Again, YMMV<br>learning as I go</div>
