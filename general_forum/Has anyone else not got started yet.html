<div class="content">My problem seems to be that I don't have a lot of free time to get started with writing this list of outstanding tasks!  I know, who does have a lot of spare time?!<br>But I get home at 6pm, chat to my other half until 7ish, cook dinner and wash up until 8or so then and only then can I do anything else.  Today I had to read for 20mins - something work related. After dinner yesterday and today I read the posts on this forum and Mark's blog and I'm now ready to comment at 10 o'clock!  And I still haven't written anything on my task list beyond item 2.  And now I ought to think about going to bed because I have to get up at 6 in the morning!<br>Does anyone else have this problem?<br>Autofocus may well be a weekend thing for me!</div>

<div class="content">No, I can't try it at work!  I would be in trouble within a few days.  My job is very reactive.  I have deadlines .  I have to do my work within either 2 or 3 days plus I have to answer phone calls and work in our reception.  I can't pick and choose whether to do these things.  <br>I've notice today that someone else was saying they don't have a lot of discretionary time and would maybe AF their tasks on days off.  I think that's the way to go for me.<br>I've added half a dozen tasks to my list today but not had the spare time to do them - well I've done one but not by reading the list first.  I just did it by remembering that I had to do it.<br>I've noticed that I do the odd job when I remember it and think I've got a moment,  not by reading my list.  Do you think that actually writing it on my list jogs my memory?</div>

<div class="content">Writing the items on the list definately jogs the memory.  I have some days with very restrictive time and the need to be reactive but have found that since starting AF this week my reactions have been different.  After one phone call I just added the action points to my list, whereas I would previously have either tried to do the items immediately at the expense of what I was already doing, or would have worried about when I would find the time.  On another phone call I requested that the person call me back at a more convenient time, whereas I would previously have allowed the interruption.<br><br>It really is the application of the system that somehow changes the focus, but don't panic about the time needed - just write what you can and try the process as recommended.  Practicing on household chores over the weekend may help to get some experience as to how the system works .......</div>

<div class="content">Sandy:<br><br>In my own experience, backed up by many of the testimonials on this forum, I find that Autofocus makes it much easier for me to meet deadlines - not more difficult.</div>

<div class="content">Ok.  Will try this weekend and let you know how I go.  Thanks for the support.</div>

<div class="content">Actually, on thinking about this, maybe I've been using AF for a few years now - just dumping everything onto one master list and picking out what I want to do when I want to do it.  I've always worked at home like that.  Not at work, I hasten to add.  Anyway, it's not really got me very far at home - I just seem to do the things that I enjoy and never get round to the rest.  <br>I'm worried that I'll never get to the routine disliked tasks - vacuuming, dusting etc.  I would probably read a book instead.  Maybe even a book about housework, rather than doing the real thing!  Has anyone done this for long enough yet to have created yet another backlog?</div>

<div class="content">Sandy<br><br>That's where Autofocus wins hands down over other list based systems. It really is like a series of closed lists and because you can choose to do only the TINIEST bit of a task before crossing it out and re-adding it if it's not finished, it completely dissolves resistance and abolishes procrastination.<br><br>I've done tasks to completion that had literally been hanging around for MONTHS!</div>

<div class="content">The reason AF works in the way it does is because it is not one list but a series of *closed lists*.  Working it in the way described does strangely result in those standard chores being done - I cleaned the oven on day 1!  Give it a try and I think you will see the difference to your previous list. Not only has it not created a backlog but it is starting to clear my old backlogs.<br><br>Good luck for the weekend!</div>

<div class="content">Ok.  Will do.  Perhaps I'll manage to give the odd five minutes to tidying up.  I can see the point that if you only have to do a tiny thing on a task then you can't really fail.  There's not much to rebel against.</div>

<div class="content">Sandy:<br><br>I've tried the open list method which you describe and the results have been exactly as you found them, only the easy stuff gets done. Autofocus does not resemble this at all. it is a completely different principle, based on a series of closed lists as Christine and Hannah have described.</div>

<div class="content">See the post entitles building the list organically.  I had pages of notes, files and my previous system I was experimenting with and found that by just jumping in the AF system gained momentum, even though I am not sure I am doing it totally right.  You can always add tasks as you go.  Also, I found my mind is aware of deadlines and priorities which is part of what drives the "jumping out" of the tasks.<br><br>Good luck.<br><br>Gerry<br></div>
