<div class="content">Does anybody have some tips for any processes you use for getting major goals onto your lists and keeping them moving?  I should clarify and say, of course, the Autofocus approach inherently keeps them moving, but just wondering if you do - for example - a weeky review of goals and add tasks from that list?  <br><br></div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline,<br><br>I like keeping my goals in view, so I added a task "list goals" to my AF list.  As this got worked on, I now have an open list of goals in OneNote which I review as often as I feel like I want to in order to keep my goals in the back of my head and provide a frame of mind for my decisions and subsequent actions.<br><br>This is the way I am running with this at the moment. So there is a) a Goals section in OneNote and b) an entry in AF (at least one) keeping it all going (might be something like "keep working on your goal overview").<br><br>Hope that helps, even if it's not much.  What I have found is that things work the best if I keep them as simple as possible and only allow for greater complexity if and when doing so provides added benefits or is absolutely necessary.<br></div>

<div class="content">I am wondering the same thing - and this concern actually makes me stick with the DIT methodology where I consistently can choose tasks that move me towards my goal to put on my "closed list" for the day.<br><br>AF has some great advantages in how easy it is to a) capture tasks b) routinely review tasks, but I am afraid it makes me more activity-oriented than goal-oriented. It would be nice to get this forum's take on this. <br><br><br>Personally I am working with a hybrid where I keep my master task list as an AF list, but where I on a daily basis create a closed list of tasks that moves me towards my major goals.<br><br>In practice I go over my goals every morning and in the daily planning I make sure to put tasks that are relevant for my major goals on my closed list for the day.<br><br>When these are done, I use the AF list which makes me regularly browse through all tasks. I also use the AF as the major capture tool. In this way I can be goal-oriented, but at the same time benefit from some of the strengths of AF.<br></div>

<div class="content">Tigerigis:<br><br>If your method works for you, then of course stick with it. I am a bit concerned though that by trying to combine both DIT and AF, you are ending up losing the main benefits of both.<br><br>In DIT the aim is not to make a selection from a master list, but to include *every* outstanding action from your current goals in your current day. You are therefore intended to be totally up-to-date with all your possible work.<br><br>In AF you also put *every* outstanding action on your list, but this time let the method itself sift the actions.<br><br>The aim of AF is to balance the rational and intuitive parts of your mind so that you make BETTER decisions than you would with your rational mind only.</div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline<br><br>Like Joshua I also keep my project management within OneNote.  Some project work is done within AF by having just the project name (generally usefull for projects where larger timeblocks are required) and others by listing individual project tasks.<br><br>You may find the FAQ's section helpful as there are some additional discussions on projects referenced there<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/645945" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/645945</a></div>

<div class="content">How about having a 'commit to:' entry on your list, that represents some kind of internal commitment that keeps you moving toward a goal.. each time you feel you need to re-commit, you make the internal commitment, cross it off, and add it to the bottom of your list again.</div>
