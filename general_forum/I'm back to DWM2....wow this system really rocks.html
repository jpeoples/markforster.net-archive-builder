<div class="content">No matter how much I experiment, in spite of all the really excellent systems I have seen and used here, I keep on going back to this workhorse.  DWM2 is such a versatile, rugged system.  Heck you can even use it using any (or at least almost any) of the processing modalities discussed in this website: randomizer, AF1, AF2, FV, SMEMA, etc.</div>

<div class="content">I've heard of DWM in passing throughout this website. What would you say makes it better over the other methods Mark offers?</div>

<div class="content">@Hail2U! <<What would you say makes it better over the other methods Mark offers? >><br><br>I would have to say, as mentioned in the first post, versatility and ruggedness.  As mentioned in the review of systems,<br><br><a href="../blog/Review of the Systems DWM (Day, Week, Month) 2.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2011/1/27/review-of-the-systems-dwm-day-week-month-2.html</a><br><br>it does away with the cumbersomeness of DWM, but it retains the other advantages and disadvantages of DWM as mentioned here, <br><br><a href="../blog/Review of the Systems DWM (Day, Week, Month).html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2011/1/26/review-of-the-systems-dwm-day-week-month.html</a><br><br>The main disadvantage, as mentioned by Mark, is the "bluntness" of the timed dismissal, and it is really easy for the list to grow into a humongous beast.<br><br>BUT, that same disadvantage of the timed dismissal can be a big advantage too.  Since dismissal is not greatly affected by how you treat the tasks but rather by how long the tasks have remained in the list, <<you can then treat the tasks however you want>>.  You can change the method you pick the next task/s anytime.  You may want to use FV on your DWM2 list now, then later AF1, then tomorrow AF2, some other time SMEMA, then the next day randomizer, etc.  <br><br>It is hard to get bored of using DWM2.  Maybe overwhelming with the amount of tasks it can accumulate, but boring?  I highly doubt it.</div>

<div class="content">@Mark Forster and @Don R: I think the futureme.org posts are for the "Time capsules" thread, right? :D<br><br>But anyways, <br><br>@Mark Forster: <<Two things I found with DWM (1 and 2):>><br><br>I remember having these same observations too, which was why I tried making systems that used 1-2 weeks dismissal, but without success.  <br><br>But back then we didn't have really good task processing systems that emphasize older tasks like FV and the randomizer, so I am hoping that the occasional use of those systems on DWM2 will help.<br><br>On another note, I am not actually using the full 30 days.  I am numbering each day with a letter of the English Alphabet plus a number from 1-7, eg. G6.  Thus, dismissal is actually after 26 days, not 30.  But meh, the markings look neater so I'm sticking with it :p</div>

Just as neat. But I don't suppose it makes much difference whether you do 24 days or 30. <br><br>Either way it means that you only number a page when you are actually working so you don't need any complicated adjustments to allow for non-working days.</div>

And, of course, it is very similar to your 1-2-7 experiments. I still have a feeling that a variation of 1-2-7 could be worked out that would avoid the problems you encountered, but I haven't figured out what the solution might be yet.</div>

"Z4" seems cleaner to me than "26D".  Besides, with numbering the divisions only whenever I work on the list means (in my mind; I haven't gone to that point yet) that 26 vs 30 divisions is not that big of a deal.</div>

<div class="content">@Austin: I have tried 7 days and 2 week systems before, but I really like having a visual and processing distinction for recurrent/unfinished items, which I really could not do satisfactorily in my experimentations before, and which apparently Avrum discarded when he proposed such systems in that thread.</div>

<div class="content">A 30 day dismissal might work best for me as I have a lot of 'waiting for items' (the waiting for items can be listed as new tasks) that can be dealt with on a dwm list instead of putting them into a calendar or outlook tasks.</div>

<div class="content">I realized along with Paul MacNeil in another thread that deciding on which "tool" to use on the list can add resistance, so I decided on using "fallback" tools on what to use whenever I am having resistance.  That is, I can still use ANY system I want on my DWM2 (although this is becoming rarer, as I am getting to love my "fallbacks"), but if I hit a wall, these "fallback" systems would come to play.<br><br>1.  Randomizer+Sliding Rule: I use this for tasks older that 7 days until it picks for me a task in the 7-days-and-younger part of the list, then I do that task and go to fallback system 2...<br><br>2.  AF4-Closed-List-Processing: I use this for the last 7 days of DWM2.  That is, starting from the last item actioned, I scan and/or do tasks til I reach the end of the list, then go back to the start of the 7-days-and-younger part of the list, and keep on circulating like this until I make a complete pass without any tasks being done.  I then go to the very beginning of my DWM2 list and start fallback system 1 above.<br><br>The reasoning for these?  Mark's observations on DWM1/2 above, which I do concur with:<br><br><a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2344775#item2346403" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2344775#item2346403</a><br><br>It IS hard to start a task more than 7 days old, which is the reason I started using Randomizer in this part of my DWM2, which cuts resistance of starting a task.  AF4-Closed-List-Processing, on the other hand, is great at handling urgent, daily, and "little and often" tasks which populate the 7-days-old-and-younger part of the DWM2 list.  Also, since the 7-days-old-and-younger part of the list is in a fluid state (constantly being updated and pruned out everyday) the old problems we had with processing the closed list in AF4 are simply not there.<br><br>...You know, this is starting to look like a reverse AF4, LOL.</div>

<div class="content">Sometimes when a task is hard to start, that's a good thing. It means the task is a candidate for deletion. I've got a few pages to do with setting up my new computer back in January that are almost ready for deletion, since I obviously haven't missed the programs yet. I'll keep a copy in my archives, just in case I think, "There was a perfect program for this on the old computer, what was it?" Archives, not todo list.</div>

<div class="content">When I used DWM 2 (I'm currently experimenting with Spinning Plates), I found that 7 and 30 day cycles resulted in too slow a pace for me.  I found that I would start too many things, such that I would continually have to automatically dismiss unfinished tasks at the 7 day mark, and my list grew to unmanagable lengths.  Deciding I needed something more focused, I shortened the cycles to 3 and 15 days.  I simply dismissed unfinished things after 3 days, and unstarted things after 15.  (A-C / 1-15 ~ A1, B2, C3, A4, etc)<br><br>By "Dismissed" I mean I would decide whether to "Kill it" (deleted for good), "Suspend it" (as in "Suspended Animation," on a Maybe/Someday List, or the Calendar), or "Reincarnate it" (re-enter it on the list, either broken down into component tasks, or re-written with a different scope).  I would consider those three options for each task upon dismissal, in that order of preference.  More often than not, I would in fact, grant my dismissed tasks a merciful death.<br><br>This focused my efforts considerably.  I found that a 3 day turn-around time for unfinished tasks put pressure on finishing in a more timely manner because I could not let my unfinished tasks coast for long.  It kept me from over-comitting because I could easily see how full my plate was by the number of unfinished tasks within the last 3 days.  Additionally, each task I began felt like more of a COMMITMENT, because I knew I would hold myself to keeping at it with a certain pace until it was finished.<br><br>As the months went by, I graduated, and I had a summer off.  The pace of summer - sans college, was much slower and I found the 3 / 15 day pace too unrelenting.  So I switched to a 5/15 day cycle, then a 7/15 day cycle, and felt comfortable with that...  Then I moved to a new, more demanding position at my job, and I kept a 3/15 pace at work, and a 7/15 pace at home...<br><br>All in all, I don't suppose I could rightly continue calling it "DWM" when it was more like "Day / 3 Day / 2 Week."  But I found that adjusting the cycle times for the pace of my life at the time made this system much more useful to me than straight Day, Week, Month.</div>

<div class="content">john:<br><br><< What does it mean (A-C / 1-15 ~ A1, B2, C3, A4, etc)? >><br><br>It's the way you number your pages so you can keep track of two separate cycles (started tasks and new tasks that haven't been started).<br><br>Miracle is deleting tasks that have been started after three days if they haven't been worked on again, and new tasks after 15 days if they haven't been started at all. <br><br>New tasks are marked in some way (say by an asterisk) so you can identify them.<br><br>You number the pages as follows:<br><br>A1<br>B2<br>C3<br>A4<br>B5<br>C6<br>A7<br>B8<br>C9<br>A10<br>B11<br>C12<br>A13<br>B14<br>C15<br>A1<br>B2 etc.<br><br>When you are on Day C for example all the unmarked tasks from the previous Day C are deleted, but the marked tasks (the new ones are left).<br><br>When you are on Day 12 for example all tasks left on the previous Day 12 are deleted. The page can then be destroyed or archived.<br><br>You only number pages on the days you are actually working so it allows for weekends, days off, all-day conferences, business trips, holidays, etc.</div>

<div class="content">All this discussion on DWM2 is bringing back memories.  And I hadn’t considered (until nuntym mentioned it above) that you could use Mark’s other systems with DWM2.<br><br>So, I think I’ll give the following amalgam a shot:<br><br>1) Create your list in a manner similar to DWM2 – Separate it into blocks, one day each, and give each block a sequential letter that repeats (I choose A-D, this means the days will be lettered ABCDABCDABCD etc.)<br><br>2) Process the list using FV:  Dot the oldest open task as the root; Ask “What do I want to do before X?” to create the preselect list; Work the preselect list in reverse order; Cross off each task when you finish working, and re-enter the routine and unfinished tasks<br><br>3) Each day, dismiss all open tasks on the most recent day with the same letter, by making some kind of dismissal mark.  I think I will draw a vertical line straight down, just to the left of each task so that it is clear from looking at the task that it is dismissed.  However you mark it, you must leave enough room in the margin to dot the dismissed tasks as you would normally dot them.  (eg:  undismissed task = “___Task”, dismissed task = “__| Task”, note in both cases, there is room to the left to dot the Task)<br><br>4) Consider all dismissed tasks to still be “open.”  As such, you may dot dismissed tasks as the root task, and you may dot them as part of the preselection process – just as you would dot any other task.  You work them off the preselection list just like you would any other task.  The difference?  Dismissed tasks have only one action that can possibly be done on them:  Review.  I described Review in an earlier comment, but I will reiterate it here for convenience, and because I added an option.<br><br>5) Review entails thinking about the task, its nature, its value, its feasibility and urgency etc., and then DECIDING to do one of the following (in this order of preference):<br> - a. Kill it – delete it from the list and don’t re-enter it anywhere<br> - b. Suspend it – delete it from this list and add it to another reminder system (calendar, tickler file, maybe/someday list etc) so that you may revisit it in the future<br> - c. Reincarnate it – re-enter it on this list, but re-written somehow (broken down into several component tasks, rolled-up with other tasks to form a larger objective, or just re-written to specify or widen the scope of the task)<br> - d. Reanimate it – re-enter it on this list, exactly as is – this should be an absolute last resort.  I chose the word “reanimate” because it conjures the image of a zombie.  A corpse of a task that grows more rotten with age and keeps coming back despite your efforts to dispatch it.  Like zombies, one or two are manageable, but in throngs they can drag your living tasks down with them.<br><br>6) Review may be done on any task, at any time, whether part of a preselection or not.  But on dismissed tasks, it is the only action that can be taken.<br><br>7) I consider all tasks after the dismissal line to be in “limbo” or “purgatory”, and those tasks which have not yet crossed over to be “alive.”  The goal is to keep your roots alive.  If you find yourself dotting dismissed tasks as your root tasks, then you have more work than you can rightly keep up with.  You can catch up using the method in DIT:  ("You fall behind because you either have too much work, you’re not working efficiently enough, or you’re not leaving enough time to work – examine your situation and take appropriate corrective action")  <br><br>8) If limbo grows too much, you can clean it up by creating your preselection lists by asking “what do I want to REVIEW before X?” instead of the normal question.  This will result in preselected lists consisting entirely of tasks to Review.  However, you would not want to keep doing this.  The goal is to keep limbo from growing in the first place, by working at a pace that keeps your commitments current – not to compensate for its growth by cleaning up periodically.<br><br>On paper, it looks like this method will have all the benefits of FV, with the added benefits of keeping the list pruned to a manageable size similar to DWM2, and the "pacing" mechanism that monitors the amount of work you have in the system like DIT.<br><br>I’ll give it a try…</div>

<div class="content">Thanks to inspirations from Miracle's post above and Steve McClatchy's book "Decide", I have been using a tweak of DWM2 for a couple of weeks, and I can see that it is quite effective.   I call it "D3WM".<br><br>D3WM is quite simply adding a new checkpoint in DWM2 at the third day, and adding a new symbol to mark certain tasks that would be deleted if not acted upon for three days (hence the name).<br><br>The third day checkpoint can be done by adding a-c (small letters) to the date marks.  For example:<br>A1a<br>B2b<br>C3c<br>D4a<br>E5b<br>F6c<br>G7a<br>A8b<br>B9c<br>C10a<br>D11b<br>E12c<br>F13a<br>G14b<br><br>I personally use an encircled dot (like a target) to mark three-day tasks.<br><br>But what are the tasks that I mark for deletion after three days?  Well, I choose no more than six at a time with the inflexible criteria that (1) it is a task whose quality of end result improves the more attention you give to it over time, and (2) it is not a scheduled nor habitual task.<br><br>These tasks can include<br>1) Tasks you want to make a habit of, eg. getting the mail daily if it is not a habit yet (and yes I am guilty of this).<br>2) (as it says on the tin) Quality of end result improves over time given, eg. exercise, learning something new, projects/assignments whose quality of result will improve the further from the deadlines you start them.<br>3) Unfinished tasks of the above criteria.<br><br>These tasks do NOT include<br>1) Maintenance tasks, i.e. tasks that do not improve quality but rather may deteriorate when not given attention, unstarted /OR/ unfinished.  Eg. most house chores, <br>2) Tasks that can be done at the deadline with no cost to quality, eg. you can bring out the trash a few hours or just before the garbage truck arrives with no change in end result (unless you are late, then you are in trouble, huehuehue).<br><br>Now why did I make this tweak? As I said, I have read the book "Decide", and I agree with the author in that it is when you are able to the the tasks that he calls "Gain Goals" (in 7 Habit parlance, these are the Quadrant II tasks), then it does not only give you the feeling of satisfaction that you are growing and improving as a person, but this also gives you the energy to do your other tasks.</div>
