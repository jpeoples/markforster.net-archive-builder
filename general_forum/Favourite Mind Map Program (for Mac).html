<div class="content">Seems like there is a LOT of choice out there these days, and I am a little  overwhelmed with what to try. So I would be very interested in hearing what *your* favourite mind map program is, and why!  I experimented with CMap over the weekend, but I would like something more Mac-friendly (for example, standard Mac dialogue boxes for saving files would be less cumbersome!).  I would like to be able to use the mind map program with a tablet (I think most allow that?) and being able to print selected branches would be nice. Also, I would like robust "exporting as outline" capabilities, drag and dropping of resources, robust printing options (for large mind maps). I have been looking at iMindMap and MindManager (which is what I think Mark and Christine both use). (I am intrigued by the approach of MindGenius, but don't think it is available for the mac). Something very intuitive for a Mac user (ie very short learning curve!) would also be appreciated! <br><br>Any and all comments about what you really like about the mind mapping software you are using would be most appreciated! <br>thanks in advance! - Bev</div>

<div class="content">I am using Freemind. The advantage that comes with Freemind is that it is absolute free, it works well on both Windows and Mac which makes it easy to use it both at home and at work and send it forward.<br><br>I think that it can do all those things that you have pointed out. It is a very easy programm but I can use with all the options that I need.</div>

<div class="content">THANKS so much, Han, Matthew, Jupiter and John, for your suggestions! I have been checking them out. I am leaning towards giving Novamind's free trial a serious go, due to its Mac origins/friendliness and its positive reviews. (I also see that I used CMap more as a CONCEPT map (lots of large text boxes) and it looks like Novamind would also be able to handle that.)</div>

<div class="content">If you want to spend the rest of your life tweaking with endless ways to connect and relate items within your information:<br><br><a href="http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/" rel="nofollow">http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/</a><br><br>Extremely powerful. Probably perfect for folks here who are looking for the Holy Grail.<br><br>I use it for longer writing projects where I want to see emergent structure(s) and relationships within notes I have taken.</div>
