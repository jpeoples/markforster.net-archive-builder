<div class="content">What is the holiday-mood and how can you recreate it?<br><br>During holidays people become very focused on<br><br>- caring for themselves, caring about feeling good and relaxing<br><br>- engaging in activities that bring them joy<br><br>- offloading cares and worries<br><br>- appreciation for good things and flow (not resisting living)<br><br>So now and again make this a project, with checklist. Now that's what I call success.</div>

<div class="content">FlyLady has a "Flying through the holidays" checklist -- she calls it a control book.<br><br>IIRC, it starts in November, takes you through American Thanksgiving, and cleaning up after the New Year's party.<br><br>Fans of Mark will like it. You start things early, make lists, and work little and often.<br><br>It's not a perfect list for everyone -- how can a single list do all that? -- but it's a very good place to start.</div>
