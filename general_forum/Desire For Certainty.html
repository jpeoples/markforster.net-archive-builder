<div class="content">Part of my procrastination in the past has been a desire for certainty that whichever task I do is the right one, and in the right order, and a visceral feeling of dread reinforced the belief that it was actually possible to be absolutely certain, and I was always in danger of messing it up, so better to just avoid.  I had already been practicing choosing to do tasks, even though I don't have definitive knowledge of whether its "perfect"--and AF is a very useful contex for continuing to practice.  The dread has always perpetuated the avoidance of doing things, because the assumption is "this feels scary, therefore it must be scary" and it takes a certain amount of courage to go ahead and do something anyway, in spite of the fear.  But as I practice, I get more experience with actually getting things done, and surviving the decision making process, and the dread diminishes--and if things go awry, I remind myself that they used to go awry while procrastinating, and at least this way I am actually moving toward what I value in life.  <br><br>In the past I would've gotten stuck on the "feeling of release" or items "popping out at me" and second-guessing myself as to whether I really chose the right item, but I'm at a point where I can see that the important thing thing is to actually just choose something, even if I haven't complete certainty, and learning to live with trial and error, which is how all learning works. And I've ignored my own sense of wants and likes and dislikes for so long, that they have become quite invisible, but they are still there, and slowly emerging.  It takes courage to do this when perfectionism and procrastination are so ingrained, and I commend all those who are working with AF and struggle with these issues.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Margaret,<br><br>I guess the platitude for the day is: "If it is worth doing, it is worth doing badly."  Or  "Doing something is better than doing nothing."  ;-)<br><br>I'm happy you brought up that form of procrastination.  People tend to focus only on overwhelm as the cause of procrastination.</div>

<div class="content">Margaret,<br><br>thanks for being so courageous to bring up this topic.<br><br>Does using the Autofocus methode help you to trust your system more than before?<br>For me it does, how about you?<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Margaret<br><br>You're so right about the fact that procrastination can have many roots and overwhelm is certainly not the only one.  In fact it is more often than not a product of procrastination rather than a cause.  It can be hard to get over feelings of fear of making the "wrong" decision but quite often the perception of "wrongness" is linked to someone else's opinions.  Remember it's ok to do things you like.  Sometimes we forget what those things are - AF will definitely move you towards what you value in life but remember that you yourself are of value. Let the process allow you to choose things you want to do for you.</div>

<div class="content">Ranier, yes, AutoFocus is helping give me a way to capture small steps, without getting stuck in the detail of something like "Getting Things Done" where every action needs to be written down in advance--I never got past that stage with David Allen's book.  If I work on any step of a task(like Mark says, "Just get the folder out")then I cross it out and move it to the back of the list, and practice those small steps, in the face of the procrastination screaming "it's not enough, do it all at once, right now"--and in fact I get more done in small bits, no matter what perfectionism claims!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Margaret<br><br>So glad that you're getting more done. It's a great feeling, isn't it, when you you start to see that you are getting things done?  It's so easy to feel that whatever we do is never enough and to believe that everyone else has somehow got it all together and that we're the only ones struggling.  Even perfectionism itself can accuse us - "how can you say you're a perfectionist when you've let this, that or the other, get into such a mess!"  With AF it finally seems possible to start taking back that control ......</div>
