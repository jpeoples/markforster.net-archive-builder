<div class="content">Knowledge and information is not very effective at changing behaviour argue the authors of "Switch: How to change things when change is hard" (so far, so Aristotle). When people want change, we often assume that if they just had a better understanding the changes would follow. Not so, according to the authors  Chip & Dan Heath.<br><br>In brief, they use the metaphor of an elephant, the path, and a rider to apply their model of change. They argue that the process of change is best seen not as ANALYZE-THINK-CHANGE but SEE-FEEL-CHANGE. They claim that traditional approaches are “all head, no heart". So, to what extent is thinking, planning and analysing avoidance of anticipated discomfort? I rather liked their point that self-supervision by the rider over the elephant is tiring and short-lived. I think that point re-expresses the argument on here about the limitations of willpower.<br><br>Many of the ideas and tactics for results used on this site can be rather neatly pulled together in their metaphor...<br><br><br>Each of the rider (plan and direct), elephant (energy from emotion) and path (environment) need to be addressed in order for results they argue. So, a "see > feel > change" recipe would go like this:<br><br>1 see the destination, outcome, result (rider)<br><br>look for whats different about times and places where successes occur (rider can spin wheels or just see problems everywhere)<br><br><br><br>2 feel (elephant)<br><br>find a feeling that energises the elephant (hope, anger, disappointment, fear, ...)<br><br>shrink the change (elephants avoid steps that feel too big). start with a 5 minute commitment 9elephant tends to need immediate gratification). small successes.<br><br><br><br>3 change (swap old behaviours for new behaviours at critical moments)<br><br>make the environment less resistant to the new behaviour, have good systems, let the new behaviour be easier to choose<br><br>use environment cues to switch an old behaviour to a new behaviour, eventually becoming a new automated habit<br><br><br><br>Outcome: rider + elephant + path = new identity.</div>
