<div class="content">So far SFv3 is working great for me but the nature of my work is keeping me from using it as intended. The general problem is i can only do 1 to 1.5 pages a day.  So it takes me 3-4 days to loop through the complete set of pages. Here is what happens:<br><br>1. Nature of my work is 80% it all comes from client requests that have to be completed in a timely manner. But they can be big time consumers. Dismissing them is not an option. So that puts a lot of pressure on column  1 items.<br><br>2. New stuff comes in at a steady clip. Urgent promises to do it today go in the current col2, urgent stuff I know I probably can't do today I've been sticking on col2 of the next page, if I happen to get to that page that's cool, and it helps pull me forward. None urgent stuff goes into column 1.  So far so good.<br><br>3. Working the list I tend to spend a lot of time scanning the current col2 to pick something to work on, then while the status bars run I start scanning the list for the next item to queue up or to multitask on (we do computer system management so there are lots of pokey tasks). The beauty of sfv3 is my peripheral vision tends to pick off column 1 items I am avoiding and as it turns out  starting and those are often better "filler" tasks to do while waiting on the next step of an urgent one.. So far still so good. This keeps me from running out of fresh column 2 space. Unfortunately many of these  col 2 tasks can take 1-2 hrs to complete.<br><br>So as stated at the start, the only problem is the velocity through the pages is awful. It is really not the the tasks I write dowe are too big, they really are naturally time consuming, and big, but SFv3 is still handling them.. I need an artificial way to break them apart without loosing track of the bigger picture.....<br><br>I think I can improve my results if I do this:<br><br>A. Treat my long tasks as "projects" ala GTD.<br>B. Enter these projects in column 1.<br>C. When I hit the project in col1 and decide to take action on it, think of the next discrete action (preferably making it artificially small)  enter that single next action in col 2, cross off the project in column 1, and renter the project in column 1. Then process col 2 in the normal fashion.<br><br>That change might  allow me to have column 2 tasks that can be completed in just one or two pages turns and a lot less duration, and reentering the projects right away in column 1 ensures that I can easily keep track of the larger goals that might take a week or two to complete. Additionally it gives me an easy way to set aside big projects when the urgent customer driven stuff gets high volume.</div>

<div class="content">I work in IT too, and I've found out today as well that when you are working on one thing, where the computer takes a long time, you can "take action" on another task on the same page and finish it or move it to the next page's column 2. While I was running one program that took 20 minutes to create a report, I was able to clean out some old email folders.<br><br>I've also been stuck on one page ALL week, which seems bad.  One thing I worked on was 5 hours of writing code for an Access database. Today I spent several hours creating a Visio diagram. Both of those were items I put in column 2 of the current page instead of getting to them later, because they needed to be worked on right away, and there was still stuff in column 1 I wanted to work on too. But now that whole page is almost done.<br><br>But there are also other tasks I regret not getting to yet. Projects involving other people waiting for me. I might just put those in column 2 as well, instead of turning the page.<br><br>The right stuff is still happening I think, even though I'm not cycling through the pages.<br><br>Well, almost.</div>

<div class="content">Bob - what you're doing sounds a little bit like Mark's project management technique that he talks about here:<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2011/2/22/whats-next-progress-report-2.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2011/2/22/whats-next-progress-report-2.html</a><br><br>The difference appears to be that you think of the discrete actions on the fly, while Mark has a prepared list that he works on.</div>

<div class="content">I've never worked in IT so it's difficult for me to advise, but it strikes me that the problem is related to not working "little and often" enough.<br><br>When I'm doing a large writing project (which I guess is somewhat similar to a large IT project in the way it can be handled), I write in fairly short bursts. So Project X would be broken up X.... X..... X.....X and so on until finished.<br><br>In SuperFocus terms that means that X is constantly moving round the list in the Column 2s of successive pages until it is completed.<br><br>When you have several large projects you have a choice of either completing Project X, then completing Project Y and then Project Z, or of doing a bit of X, a bit of Y, a bit of Z and alternating them.<br><br>The first method (finishing each project in turn) is the most efficient and the quickest, but may not always be possible.<br><br>I think you also need to look at your definition of urgent. For SuperFocus purposes "urgent" means "need to be working on it on the page I'm currently on". You may need to keep a list of times when various projects become urgent, so you can enter them in Column 2 at an appropriate time.</div>

<div class="content">urgent = "need to be worked on this page". Ah ha!I should think of that rather than "I guess I should work on this now" and moving it to column 2 from another page.</div>

<div class="content">Think this through: You need to be able to move forward. <br><br>Stuff on the current page does NOT need to be done now. Well maybe one or two or four do. The rest can wait.  You are moving forward and will return in due time.  Stuff that comes in as you work these is not all urgent. It can't all be urgent or you'll never move forward.<br><br>So then, a few small tasks, one big task, and few urgent items, and you should be able to complete or advance all these faster than new urgent tasks come in.    Otherwise, it's not the system's fault; you actually ARE overloaded and better figure a solution soon!</div>

<div class="content">It think it may be the nature of the work that makes it harder for others to follow. Trust me I know the difference between URGENT and not-URGENT.<br><br>IT tasks; even the simple one tend to come in the really LONG variety that especially true in system management and programming. So if you are like most of us in the field you get inbound tasks for the employee population. In my case 600+ people. Anything that's truly broken goes on the list. It's not so much that we get too much URGENT stuff it's that we get too much ACTIVE stuff. My column two can have 10-20 active tasks, each taking the majority of the day to complete. If each 1 takes a REQUIRED burst of t 10-15 minutes move them forward that is little over two hours of work. Throw in a couple interruption of DO it now, and a couple of urgent items that are truly URGENT and poof 7 hours is gone; and your still on the same page. It seems to be the nature of the work; but it may be possible to learn new ways to do that.  <br><br>It's nice to say make them smaller; but when the work involves getting on a users computer from remote and working on it; thus preventing them from working, two things become true: (1) You need to fix it in one or two goes because you can't interrupt the users every couple of hours for several days. (2) The user is watching you and if you go idle on their task while you work on something else they will complain.<br><br>As it is stands SFv3 is working great, I truly believe I could use it as is for years to come. It balances the AF versions nicely allowing me to balance project work; routine system maintenance and help desk calls without loosing track of either the urgent junk, the important project stuff, or the sustaining routine stuff.  It's just that the velocity is slower compared to what others are experiencing; that doesn't make it wrong it just makes it different.<br><br>The origin of this post was more to discuss artificial ways to break down these tasks into smaller action-able items than they normally lend themselves to. If figure their might be others in the field that would have a similar problem and we could compare notes.</div>

<div class="content">I hear what you're saying but I would do it different. Instead of 20 items in column 2 I would have maybe 3. The others go to the end of the list. Then you get those going and shortly get to the other stuff later in the day. The result would be a FIFO queue of handling calls with the other column reserved for "my computer's down" and the things you are working now.</div>

<div class="content">If everything is urgent, then nothing's urgent. <br><br>That's because priority is about the order in which you do things. If you give everything the same priority then you are no further forward in deciding what order to do them in.<br><br>The degree of urgency you give tasks or projects is related to the order in which you are going to do them. As I said in my earlier post it is more efficient and quicker to do projects in turn than to attempt to do them all at once.<br><br>This is because if you do XYZXYZXYZ you finish Project X, Y and Z at approximately the same time.<br><br>But if you do XXXYYYZZZ you finish Project X four sessions before you would in the previous example, Y two sessions before you would in the previous example, and Z at the same time as you would in the previous example.</div>

<div class="content">You may work for five hours but I am not sure this is really so intensive.<br>As for me if I go to the toilets or need to get up to fill my coffee cup, my current action is considered unfinished and re-entered on C2 of the next page.<br>You should consider any little break, or someone asking you something and you having to find some information to answer him, or just looking at you cellphone mail as a break that should turn you current action as unfinished, and so writing it on the next page C2. You would then really advance more.<br>When you worj on the computer of a user I guess you should consider it blocked time and not discretionary time, so if it could be treated as a calendar task instead of a saf task it may be helpful.<br>Btw I don't think you should have a lot of currently active unfinished tasks in C2, otherwise you will have to dismiss everything very soon. I suggest you review your writing of actions so only your most important big project would be on C2 as unfinished task (like the war and peace project of Mark), and urgent tasks you can do in one burst.<br>Just imagine this : if you go through your list 2 times per day, anything you have to do today can be written on the last page right? I think this is the flow you should aim for, this will resolve all your big problems.<br>I think going 2 times through the list a day and before going back home checking the last page to be sure nothing has been left undone could be efficient.</div>

<div class="content">isd,<br><br>I think you have the right idea. I finally got unstuck and was able to permanently close two pages all of a sudden, and now I am flying through the system. Column 2 was not holding me back. Unfortunately I found some tasks on the next few pages that I forgot that made me say "I should have done these a week ago! I totally forgot!" An important tip (maybe it should be a rule) : make sure that you cycle through every page, or if you can't, you should still REVIEW every page every day, just in case you are forgetting something important.</div>

<div class="content">Yes, some people use the following method :<br>Each morning they quickly read through the whole list and rewrite the task that became urgent for the day on the C2 of the current page.</div>

<div class="content">I have not tested it myself but for people who have difficulties browsing the whole list every day you may want to try for one day a rule that force you to do only one action on c1 then all the actions on c2 then goto next page. You will quickly finish all your c2 actions and browse the list many times. In fact it would be a mod for saf that could be called HIGH PRIORITY TASKS KILLER (lol</div>

<div class="content">isd:<br><br>We already have a system which is very similar to what you are proposing. It is called the Three Task System.<br><br>You can read about it at:<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2011/1/27/review-of-the-systems-three-task-method-3t.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2011/1/27/review-of-the-systems-three-task-method-3t.html</a></div>

<div class="content">Priority needs perspective.<br>All things are relative to each other.<br>If you can't go through your list, you can't know which thing is the most important in there so cycling is the name of the game. Aim for forward movement in SF3.</div>
