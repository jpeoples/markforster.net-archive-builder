<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2011-03-3 19:32</div>
<div class="content">I thought I had posted this but it seems to have disappeared!<br><br>I am looking for some ideas and/or advice.  Can anyone advise me of how they record time spent on different customers / projects which can then be used for invoicing?<br><br>I have a very long winded way of doing it which created a lot of resistance to recording the time or even raising invoices!  Any help or advice would be ueful.<br><br>Essentially I need to record what time I have spent on different customers/tasks so I can invoice for the correct amount of time - so it is a question of recording time spent and then using this to determine the content of the invoice.</div>

<div class="content">There's lots of ways.  The simplest is a page like<br>8:00<br>8:15<br>8:30<br>...<br>18:00<br>And write the customer's name by each as you go.  There's software to do this too.<br>Me, I just log actual work, and estimate hours at day's end, but I'm not billing customers.<br><br>Question: is your work all the same sort?  Is it in one computer program, or otherwise all electronic?  Is it big or small chunks of time?  Do you have per-customer files/folders that you want to keep the numbers there?</div>

<div class="content">That's odd - I just did another post that has disappeared. I must be doing something wrong!<br><br>I have multipile clients (but only about 6 at the same time) who have mutliple projects. I tend to have to attend to each of these during a normal day.<br><br>I work on the computer most of the time with few actual files - I just keep customer files for anything that is not on the computer.  <br><br>I need to create an invoice for each customer each month. I need to break this down by project and/or by time spent each day (sort of like weekly timesheets). Mostly my customers are flexible as long as they can see what I have worked on and are happy I can account for my time.</div>

<div class="content">I'd think the first question would be: What system are you using? Paper? Digital? SF? Another? <br><br>This might be too simplistic for your purpose, but it's what came to mind. I use SF on paper. I recently had to complete 4 hours worth of work (log 4 hours worth of progress) on a particular project over two days time. When I realized this, I put it into C2. I worked on it for 40 min and when I crossed it out and wrote it on the next page in C2 I wrote '40 min'. When I arrived at the item in C2 of the following page I worked on it for 20 min and did the same thing (cross out, write time, re-enter on next page C2). At the end of the first day, I counted up my time and I had completed 3 hours. I didn't have an entry in SF to add the time up but in your case, maybe you could/would. The next day, I completed the final hours work in two 30 min sessions in the same way. It was GREAT. And I picked off some easy things from C1 on each page to complete along the way to boot.</div>

<div class="content">malisa - <br><br>Great idea!   I've been entering things like blood pressure readings into my SF list, for later processing / entry in my spreadsheet.   But this goes even further on using SF for simple, practical data collection.   I'll have to try this idea for some other things.   Thanks!!</div>

<div class="content">You're welcome. Because I found myself jotting things like this and notes from phone calls, I'm using facing pages for C1 and C2 in my large Moleskine cahier. I wasn't finding enough free-space with a steno pad, which was what I started with.</div>

<div class="content">I have just the solution! I've been using this for years: <a href="http://davidseah.com/node/the-emergent-task-timer/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://davidseah.com/node/the-emergent-task-timer/</a><br><br>I use the wide version which holds up to 12 hours in 15 minute segments. Download the PDF and print out like 50 copies. Put them in a file folder which is within easy reach. First thing in the morning grab a fresh copy, put the day and date on it, and number the hours starting with the current hour.<br><br>On the left side I put the relevant budget lines as they come up (Overhead, Customer A, Customer B, etc.). Then fill in the bubbles as you go. I also tend to draw brackets around scheduled meetings.<br><br>On the bottom I write the detail (sideways) of precisely what I was doing i.e. what goes on my status report at the end of the week. <br><br>At the end of the day I count up the little bubbles on each row and that's what goes in my timesheet (2.25 for cust A, 2.0 overhead, etc.).<br><br>I also just mark down an X instead of a solid bubble for unproductive time just so every time is accounted for somehow.</div>

<div class="content">@Malisa - thanks for that idea - how many there are too many customers/tasks to do this effectively - I'd probably drown my SF system with entries as I have to chop and change a lot with tasks and customers.<br><br>@Don - thanks for the link - I'l' check that out - not sure if I need a manual or a software solution. I'm sort of looking for something I don't have to think about too often!</div>

<div class="content">I looked at ETT a while ago then compressed it, using Excel. <br>Rows are activity (same)<br>columns are days not 15minutes<br>cells are hours spent each day on an activity.</div>
