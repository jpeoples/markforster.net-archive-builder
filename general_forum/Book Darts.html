<div class="content">The other day I bought some book darts ~ (they are at Barnes & Noble, by the book marks, or see bookdarts.com) <br><br>They are just the right size, and wonderful for marking where I am on the page. If I get sidetracked, I know exactly where I left off, and they are easy to move around.<br><br>They're also good for marking a task "in progress" (Sometimes I can do two tasks at once, such as listening to an audio lecture while doing a mindless task).<br><br>Sarah J<br></div>

<div class="content">I found that a very simple method of marking the current task is to mark it with an empty circle. When it's complete, I highlight the task with a marker, but I don't fill in the circle until I start doing the next task.<br>That way, I can finish up tasks and take a break (or sleep) and know where I left off.</div>

<div class="content">I've found that book darts are a good alternative to Post-It flags - they don't lose their "stick", and they don't lift fresh ink off the page. Recommended :)</div>

<div class="content">Since years, I have the habit to put a > before anything that is a task - be it in scribbles regarding a project, be it on a list, be it wherever - and to circle the > and strike out the text behind it once the task is done. (As a counterpart, I use the < for things I am waiting for.)<br><br>So, of course, I use the same signs on my AF list. The only difference: I circle the > once I START the task, and I strike out the text once I STOP. So, to circle the > is my act of committment, as Mark Forster said.<br><br>When I leave the AF notebook in the evening, I put an * before the last task I was working on. When I return, I circle the *. This way, I know all the time where I left off, because there should be only one free * at any time.</div>
