<div class="content">Thanks for sharing, Mark!  I'm in a weird spot in the school year, so I think I'll let others jump in and try this out first.  I'll spend the month clearing the decks, getting a new diary/calendar, follow the discussion and either start this off in March (because the shortened month of Feb. makes this weird for me--maybe I'll just treat it as a 4 wk thing?) or as soon as school is out.<br><br>Again, thanks!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Avrum,<br><br>let me give your questions a shot:<br><br>I interpret the new System as beeing an Autofocus list with built in dismissal dates. Every task remains active for at least one month. Once you start working on something, you only get a week to continue. All pages later than today are active, all pages earlier are dismissed. The way I understand it is that the calendar is not serving a daily planning purpose but is only serving as an automatic dismissal or deletion mechanism.<br><br>Put differently: if you have taken on an obligation and haven't started working on it within a month, then there is possibly something wrong with it. This means that you need to analyze what is wrong.<br><br>The proposed system is clearly a task management system and not a time management system, despite being run inside a calendar.<br><br>Oh, and to your #3, once a task is finished, you take it from the list.<br><br>Hope this helps,<br><br>Klaus</div>

<div class="content">I understand that you ENTER new tasks on a page that is 1 month away, but WORKING from the list means going through ALL pages from today to this page 1 month away (31 pages at the most) and working on whatever task stands out.<br><br>You work as long as you feel like, but this feeling might change once you have internalized that RE-ENTERING means that now you only have 1 WEEK to pick it up again.<br><br>Hmm.<br><br>I guess I'm more the AF type. At least this new rule set does not ignite the "hey wow cool" feeling in me that reading the original AF rule set did. I'm curious how this will work for others, but in the moment I stay with my slightly adapted AF3 system...</div>

<div class="content">It sounds like a great idea for dismissal ! <br><br>The only thing I don't understand is why one doesn't just write things down on the current day, re-write on the next day you work on it so you only keep bringing it forward as you work on it, go back to previous days to choose tasks as well as desired/inspired, then delete anything that's on any page more than a month old.<br><br>It also seems you'd have to really watch the phrasing of tasks.  Big, multi-month projects would have to be chunked down, which is probably a good thing anyway.</div>

<div class="content"><<The only thing I don't understand is>><br><br>Jacqueline - your idea is quite sound. <br><br>However as someone mentioned on the blog portion of this site... the new system is starting to morph into your average to-do list with built-in dismissal.</div>

<div class="meta">2010-02-1 15:20</div>
<div class="content">I like this "dismissal deadline" very much. I'm working with an index-card based system which consists of a tickler, an AF part, and - since the last few months - a kind of "backward tickler". Unactioned items, mostly ideas, are allowed to stay for four weeks in the "backward tickler" before they drop off into an archive. The idea is to allow a kind of incubation time, since ideas need time to grow and form into themes or actions. <br><br>What I like about the new System is that it has this 4-week-incubation-time built in, and that unactioned items are removed from the list automatically. So I just rearranged my cards to represent AF5, or whatever it will be called. In addition, I will keep my classic tickler which feeds cards into the list on a daily basis. Since these are mostly routine jobs, I plan to add them to the current day, instead of one month ahead.<br><br>For the moment, I'm quite happy. It feels as if Mark had incorporated my vague attempt into a well-thought system...</div>

<div class="content">I'm very bad with sticking to an organized list.  A1 to A4 never worked for me.  A list has only been a list for me.  Getting messy in 15 min and all the rules forgotten.<br><br>Now, the new systems seems to speak to me. I actually like it very much, and not because it's new and shiny.  I'm ready to try it.  Thank you Mark for posting it today, because yesterday I outlined my own system, which is different but merges very well with your idea.  I can start practicing both and will see how it goes.  <br><br>I only need to keep my lists neat.</div>

<div class="content">Has Mark abandoned the idea of a closed list? I thought that was one of the main features of DIT. That was the part of DIT that I was looking forward. Knowing how much work I have on my plate today.</div>

<div class="meta">2010-02-1 16:44</div>
<div class="content">My initial reaction was the same as with AF1-4: no way that's gonna work. But thinking it over I see some interesting things:<br><br>* one long list that you can process in whatever way seems suitable<br>* automatic dismissal, as in AF2 ("the marching line of doom" as someone called it). In AF2 the automatic dismissal process was too slow for me, I can see how it would work better in this new system<br>* still a closed list, although it doesn't look like it: today's page can't be added to! So if nothing else that's what you should work on to call it a day without dismissing them.<br>* being able to see how much work comes in each day, and how much I'm clearing every day<br><br>So I think I'll be trying this for a few months...</div>

<div class="content">Ulrich -- thanks for those thoughts.  I also have an index card system for routine tasks.  I was using AF and the Routine Cards separately, but I'll try merging them now.<br><br>I can almost see the solution for adding a DIT/closed list/current initiative feature.  Much like the Daily Routines you add to Today (or keep in the front), I could have a card for Current Initiative (which starts on top Every Day).  Then a 2nd card in the stack for today's closed list, culled from a review of all cards at the end of the previous day.  Only a few choice (or urgent) items would make it to this list.  I'd let the system work its magic with the rest.  That way I'd still get the Warm Feeling of Finished List at the end of the day.<br><br>Sure, I'll be duplicating some items, but my memory is good enough for that.  When I next see the *done* item elsewhere in the stack, I'll just remove it or tick it off.<br><br>If I were using a page-a-day diary or my beloved Field Notes, I'd use 2 sticky notes, as I did with previous AF systems.</div>

<h2>Reply by Mike</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-02-1 17:26</div>
<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>O.K.  So ....<br><br>>>>  But in the case of the new DIT2/AF5 system, I think it might be more helpful to have other people working on it with me at the same time so that we can share our experiences of it together.<br><br>So what I am going to do now is to share the basic outline of what I’m doing now, so others can run with it and see what they can make of it. I’m not going to go into much detail because I think that would destroy the purpose of the exercise - the detail should appear from our experience of working the system.  <<<<br><br>I like your thinking Mark.  The only thing I think has already become evident is that some terms are a bit unclear.<br><br>>>>  This is what it consists of:<br><br>1. You need a page-a-day diary with plenty of lines. Also some form of bookmarking for today’s date and the two entry pages (see below) - though turned down page corners are probably quite sufficient.  <<<<br><br>I now get why you need so many lines.  Everything you work on and don't complete is getting dumped on to a page where you already added all new tasks that came up on that day.  The light dawns ;-)<br><br>>>>  2. All new tasks are entered on the page which is one calendar month from today’s date. Example: Today’s date is February 1st. New tasks are entered on the page for March 1st. Tomorrow I will enter new tasks on March 2nd and so on. <<<<br><br>Here is the first point where I see that we need some clarification.  It SEEMS as if you can't start working on something new until a month ahead.  What I think you are intending is that this system looks FORWARD for work, rather than BACKWARD, as the AF systems did.  IOW, you are not continually scanning the past, but scanning the future, as it were.  I'm not sure how much of a change this really is, but I'll bet the psychological effects will turn out to be significant.<br><br>As noted by others, this comes down an implied rule: "You start work on a task within one month."  The effect is that you can't ignore a task for a month and still think you have any intention of doing it at all.  Nice.<br><br>>>>  3. All re-entered tasks are entered on the page which is one week from today. So any task I re-enter today (Monday February 1st) goes on the page for for next Monday (February 8th). Tomorrow (Tuesday) they will go on the page for next Tuesday 9th and so on.  <<<<br><br>As noted, this comes down an implied rule: "You must continue work on a task within one week."  The intention is that if you don't do anything on a task within a week, you need to consider what is going wrong, slipping, etc.  Nice.<br><br>>>>  4. Nothing is ever entered on any page, other than the pages currently one month and one week from today’s date.  <<<<br><br>O.K.  There is the closed list people have been hankering for ;-)  The only difference seems to be (and again, I have not read your DIT books, but they are ordered and in the mail -- see, I'm not TERMINALLY stubborn, though my wife would challenge that ;-) that one can't PLAN a days' work ... which is what I gathered the essence of DIT was.<br><br>You fundamental "grass catcher" is going to be one month hence, and no matter how long or short the day, or if it falls on a weekend or not, it is going to have all that work piled on.  In addition, incomplete tasks will also be dumped there a week before you reach it, thus all those lines.  When you get there, you are very probably going to have a TON of work to do.  So I can see some possible problems there.<br><br>SUGGESTION: Should we distinguish between weekends and weekdays in this system.  IOW, will it be problematic to add work tasks to a weekend simply because the date falls that way?  The converse is also true.<br><br>>>>  5. All active pages are treated as if they were one long list and you continue to circulate round them doing the tasks that stand out.  <<<<br><br>I think we need to define ACTIVE PAGES.  I'm assuming that this means TODAY plus all pages FORWARD?  This really does have the feel of an upside down AF list ;-)<br><br>If this is the definition of "active pages" it changes the idea of "closed list" a bit.  IOW, you are working on today's "closed list" plus the "closed lists" for the next six days, plus the "open list" for the seventh day, plus the "closed lists" for the next 21 days (or whatever), plus the "open list" for one month ahead.  It certainly sounds more confusing than it actually is.  Now I'm starting to think that the concept of "closed list" really has lost its effect.<br><br>>>>  6. All tasks which are on pages earlier than today’s date have expired. They are dead, done for, dismissed, deceased.  <<<<br><br>Mark, could you come up with a different word for "dismissed"?  ROTFLMAO ;-)  Never let it be said that you don't learn from feedback ;-)<br><br>SUGGESTION:  I'm assuming that we are going to put into effect some kind of AF like dismissal rule.  IOW, was your thinking that things just kind of "expire" or that we go through some kind of review where we yellow line so the ones that expired stand out for future consideration, and deliberately reconsider other tasks to be moved forward one week?<br><br>>>>  The thinking behind this is that you can put anything you like into the system. If you do nothing about it, it will remain there for a month and then expire. If at any time you commit yourself to a task by taking some action on it, you are put under increased pressure to get it finished by being given only seven calendar days to do some more work on it. Of course many tasks are done in one go, so can be deleted without being re-entered.<br><br>That’s all you need to get started.   <<<<br><br>Great.  I like it.  It makes a lot of sense and your thinking about this way of approaching tasks is inspired.  It is also a good reason to continue to call it "autofocus" ... it still has the effect of "automatically focusing" one.<br><br>SUGGESTION: We probably need to consider how to transition to this system.  I suppose I could date the next 30+ pages (skipping the dates for the next six days) then treat my entire back pages as if they were on today's page, pretend that the next week is all that backlog, and then a week later I should be fully operational?  Does that make sense to anyone?<br><br>This really does sound like fun ;-)  Thanks Mark.</div>

<div class="content">I'd been thinking I wasn't going to try the new system because my schedule is so unpredictable that the un-dated-ness of AF works very well for me.  But... now I'm fighting the temptation to go and date a month's worth of pages in my AF book because I have truly urgent work for this afternoon.<br><br>I second Mike's question about how to transition from whichever iteration of AF we're using to this new system.</div>

<div class="meta">2010-02-1 18:06</div>
<div class="content">“Has Mark abandoned the idea of a closed list?”<br><br>Donna, as I would see it: Today's page is somehow a closed list. Everything not tackled today (and subsequently either finished or carried forward by 7 days) will be dismissed automatically. And you can not add any new items on today’s page.<br><br>“The only thing I don't understand is why one doesn't just write things down on the current day”<br><br>Jacqueline, I think that’s part of the automatic dismissal. If something new comes up, you have one month to tackle it. Once you have started working on it, but not finishing it in one go, you have 7 days time to pick it up again.<br><br>But I must admit, I haven’t started the system yet. Just wonder about two little modifications (ahh, the tweaks again):<br>•	Daily recurring tasks: have it on today’s page, finish it and cross it off, put the next instance on tomorrow’s page (not the page which is one week from today)<br>•	Tasks with a deadline: I would put them on the page for the respective deadline date<br><br>Mark, any comments on my ideas?</div>

<div class="meta">2010-02-1 18:16</div>
<div class="content">Christian,<br><br>I would expect that Mark might say use a calendar for the date senstive tasks, but since you are already using a calendar, I'd write them in some distinctive way on the appropriate day.  Of course, you'd then have to scan ahead to avoid missing.<br><br>Recurent tasks: if you want to put them in this system, I'd say that they'd be the exception to the rule of not putting anything on any other page ... OR ... since this is one long list that you are cycling through, you'll get to that page a week hence and see them there.  Unless you feel you really need to see them listed on the exact day they need to be done.  If that is the case, I'd put them on the correct page, or simply take them OUT of this system.  I have reminder lists and cards that are no part of this system.  For example, I have a list of things my wife likes me to pack in her lunch in the morning.  I have grocery shopping lists.  None of that goes into the AF list.  Nor does "brush teeth", "take show".  LOL ;-)  There are just some things that don't NEED management ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi,<br><br>OK, isn't this really as simple as:<br><br>+  New tasks get entered on the list with a 30 day expiration period.<br>+  Re-entered tasks get entered on the list with a 7 day expiration period.<br>+  Unactioned tasks expire after 30 or 7 days, respectively, and simply get deleted.<br><br>I think referencing a calendar confused people when these three rules seem to sum it up.

<div class="meta">2010-02-1 18:47</div>
<div class="content">Mike,<br><br>about entering your current tasks: my tasks are all on dated pages, so I have a record of when I entered a task in AF4. I intend to transfer all those tasks into the corresponding pages one month later in the new system. It's not exactly as in the new system, because it doesn't take into account whether a task was reentered or not, but for most tasks still living in my AF4 list it would be okay.</div>

<div class="meta">2010-02-1 18:50</div>
<div class="content">Ken,<br><br>I think your summary is correct. The advantage of a calendar is that you don't have to keep track of when you entered a task or whether it was a re-entered task or not; you just write the task on the day it's going to expire.<br><br>I agree using a calendar could confuse people into thinking this is a plan-your-day system, but I think I would get used to that pretty quickly, especially when keeping this system separate from my actual calendar.</div>

<div class="content">And another thing ;-)<br><br>I'm thinking it makes more sense to work with the "grass catcher page" as 1 MONTH ahead rather than 30 days.

<div class="content">David,<br><br>First of all you CAN do anything you like! ;-)  But if you are trying to adhere to the spirit of how this new system works don't see the dates as having ANYTHING to do with a calendar.  The two dates are just there to put pressure on you to get working on stuff.  So the input page (grass catcher in my terms) is one month forward not because things need to be done then, but as an AUtOMATIC dismissal mechanism.  If you don't work on those tasks within a month they need to go.  Likewise for the week forward, if you don't CONTINUE working on an unfinished task, you need to be goosed!<br><br>Now if a task has a DUE DATE, what have we done with ANY AF system?  We have put it OUTSIDE of the system and onto a calendar.  Do the same here.  OR, if you want to give a double meaning to the dates on the pages of your book, go ahead and put it in your dated AF book but I'd put it somewhere different on the page, like in a box or something.  Or write it in passionate purple ;-)</div>

In fact, I plan to put dated items in my AF book.  I mostly use an electronic reminder for things like that.  My iPhone calendar, for example.  But since I have my nose in my AF book most of the time, it makes sense to write due date items on the correct page of the AF book right at the top in RED with a box around them.<br><br>As you are, I want stick with the spirit of AF5, but it needs to work for ME.

<div class="content">One thing I like about the automatic dismissal is that while with AF4 you can leave it be for a few days and pick up afterwards without any major complications, doing the same here with AF5/DIT2 will force you to recognize that while you are leaving it be, you are letting several tasks expire without really knowing which.<br><br>So basically it will encourage you to interact with the system every day which will in turn force you to utilize it to its full potential.</div>

<div class="content">DIT - the new and the old...<br><br>I tend to agree with Steve two posts back. One of the beautiful ideas behind DIT in my view was the factual journaling of your day. Even though for planning purposes I always prefer a weekly calendar, after I entered the appointments in the DIT diary this would enable me to see at a glance how much I could attempt to do on any given day.<br><br>An e-Mail with a two hour job would come in today. I would immediately see that I am travelling tomorrow, therefore unable to work on this until the following day and this would be where I enter it. Of course certain things could be scheduled even further in advance. This elegance I very much admired in DIT. Also certain periods like weekends could be reserved for the kids or, if necessary, switched over to work periods.<br><br>However you look at it, this new system seems to be more of a motivational, psychiological ploy than the planning system that was DIT. I was really hoping for an addition in order to better handle interruptions for example. Also the recurring task bit is in my view not handled successfully. And finally I like to have all my eggs (tasks and appointments) in one basket. To have two separate diaries with different usage seems to confuse the issue.<br><br>Klaus</div>

The to do items then go around these reserved time blocks. This will also allow me to fit in the rest of my family and to reserve time for various kid events, playing and of course time with my wife.<br><br>The result is a day to day overview on how I plan to use my time and how I used it in the past.

<div class="content">Looking at the new system I think I stay away from it, to avoid the confrontation with all those empty pages.<br>Was it not for the difference 'new tasks' - 're-entered tasks', I have the impression that setting an automatic dismissal 7 days back would allow an easy conversion from AF to DIT2.  New tasks could be processed by giving them 4 lives (4 weeks) where a 're-entered task' has only 1 life. A 'new task' could then be pushed 3 times forward by the dismissal line.  This would give the greater simplicity of an automatic dismissal, hampered by a complex - messy - unusual  4 lives dismissal.<br>On the other hand  using a calendar where open - actionable items stand on today and the next 30 days is also unusual.

<div class="content">It seems to me that the electronic version of this system could be very different than the paper one. The basic requirements are that an unactioned task is automatically dismissed in one month, and that a task in progress is dismissed after one week. This could be done in an electronic system without explicitly using calendar pages. Whether this *feels* good to use is another matter.<br><br>I worked with David Allen at Actioneer many years ago, and his main innovation was that todos should *never* go on a calendar. In the case of AF5, the calendar is being used for an end date and not a start date, so this is not exactly a violation of David's principles. However, once you base your system on a calendar, the temptation to start using the calendar in a more traditional time-management manner is going to be very tempting. For me personally, keeping the calendar out of the system, yet having automatic dismissal, would be the ideal scenario.</div>

<div class="content">Initial Impressions<br><br>I set it up with a Franklin Covey Compass Classic 2-pages-per-day Planner (US) Diary (UK).<br><br>1. I will slowly need to develop a surer way to distinguish between "re-entering" an existing task and "entering" a new task. If I have an ongoing project to purge my (real physical) file cabinet, and my next task is to purge the "Computer" folder, and I finish that task, do I re-enter the next task, which is to purge the "Consultants" folder, or do I enter a new task? It is all part of an ongoing project, so it would make sense to call it a re-entry and give it a 7-day deadline. But, it could be viewed as a new task in an old project, which would permit a one-month deadline.<br><br>2. I can see that either I will stick with the system and it will impose a rigorous discipline on me, or I will break down and abandon the system. In years past, I gave deadlines to all my tasks. And then I blithely ignored them. This new system is quite different from AF4 (and other AFs). In the AFs, I developed a habit of reading many books simultaneously. I might read as little as a page or two in a book, and then return to it 3-4 weeks later and read another page. With this new system, that will no longer be possible. And that is probably better. It really will focus me on a narrower range of active items. Of course, how I resolve the issue in number 1, above, will greatly affect how the system works. If working on an ongoing project qualifies for "re-entry" then I will be forced to limit (i.e. focus) how many projects I take on at any time. I see that I might be working more on fewer projects than I was in AF4. Again, this strikes me as a good thing, but I can't be sure until I try it.<br><br>3. This seems to be the first system since DIT1 that is effective for me for recurrent tasks. I never could get my recurrent tasks to integrate in the AFs. I always had to go outside the system. But I have incorporated them seamlessly in this new system.<br><br>In conclusion, I have mixed emotions. There is some anxiety. I can hear the clock ticking as never before, since I have a page that expires on 9 February and it is filled with items. On the other hand, I sincerely believe that I could seriously become more disciplined if I am able to stick with the rigid deadlines this new system will impose on me.</div>

<div class="content">Moises,<br><br>Re point 1 - it really depends what you think will motivate you better and that may vary from one project to another.  <br><br>You can manage that project at the project level by continually re-entering the project name on the list, in which case you would re-enter 7 days away.  Or you could write the next task on the list 30 days away.  It's really up to you.  <br><br>I use both approaches.  Across my projects I have some that work better by just entering the project name (and possibly having a separate list of tasks for the project) and others that just have the next thing to do.<br><br>Of course re-entering the project name 7 days away means that you will be forced to work on it more regularly (or dismiss it).</div>

<div class="content">Moises - in the comments to the blog post (2nd page of the comments I think) there's a comment about using numbered pages instead of dated pages.

If I decide to try this new method, I think I'll use 31 index cards. I love the idea of tearing up "today's" card. And flipping through cards seems more natural than paging through a day planner (U.K. "diary").

<div class="content">I really don't know what to think of this new system (and therefore refrained from commenting up to now). <br><br>But re the dates issue, I have the impression that four weeks would be much more practical than one month. (1) This would solve the (micro-)problem of uneven month lengths (with February having only 28 days and most months having 31) and (2) I'd much rather not have my work tasks expire on Saturday or Sunday, keeping the synchronicity of the week day instead.<br><br>And yes, the mashup of a calendar/diary and a task list is a problem for me, too.<br><br>Alex</div>

I agree, a pack of cards is more likely to fall on hard times than a book, but Alan's suggestion really does make it simpler ... you don't even need the pages numbered, if you don't want to have numbered pages.  You just find the 30th page ahead and mark it with a clip and enter tasks there.  You mark the one 7 ahead with a clip then the system runs without reference to dates or page numbers or anything.  Just move each clip ahead one each day and throw away the first page.<br><br>Also, this answers the problem people see of putting the system aside for a few days then trying to restart it.  With dates it seems as if it would be a mess to restart.  Without dates, you just pick it up and restart it as if it were the next day.<br><br>But that was a good one about how one could find a pre dated book ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Mark Forster asked: "[ubi wrote:] << Alan's insight also exposes the arbitrariness of the next-week and next-month deadlines >> It does? How?"<br><br>Yes. By thinking of page#8 and page#31 (or index card#s). When you realize you only need to handle 31 pages or cards, the question leads to "Why 31? Why not 25?" etc.<br><br>Mark also asked: "[ubi wrote:] << I wonder if Mark thinks there is something important about having all the "dead" pages in the diary and carrying it around all year... >> Well, exactly the same applies to an appointment diary or to a book you are reading. Do you tear the pages out of them once you've used/read them? Maybe you do."<br><br>No, but the already-read pages of a book aren't "dead" to me in the same way that crossed-off lists are, and I don't need to carry the current book I'm reading with me everywhere, for a whole year.  An appointment diary has potential value for all the days of the year, both in planning and reviewing dates of events.  In AF, we didn't need a 365-page notebook, and a pocketable one worked fine for AF4.  So my question was really about whether you thought there was value in reviewing the old pages in this new system. If I understand your new system correctly, the old pages are truly dead, and the pages after today+31 cannot be used. So unless we combine functions into some type of reminder system + your new system, we're only using 8.5% of the pages.<br><br>Finally, Mark joked: "Perhaps you'll understand it better after the first few times you have dropped your index cards and have to rearrange them all."<br><br>Yes, perhaps. But I think I'll try it that way, as being able to keep something in my pocket, with enough room to write the lists, is a big advantage over carrying a non-pocketable journal or diary.</div>

One month is the same number of the month as today. <br><br>What is difficult about that?"<br><br>I think I get why this is a problem at first for many and why Alan's idea of numbered rather than dated pages seems good at first blush (even though they're really the same basic method).<br><br>When you go into a fuller explanation of this new system (which I've been calling Forward Focus) you just need to make it clear that this "list calendar" has nothing to do with one's appointment calendar.  It's not a problem for me because I use google's calendar for appointments and a notebook for the new system.  It is undeniably strange to write something on my list that I know is "due" by the end of the week or so on a list that, at the top of the page, says "March 3rd" because by March 3rd I'd be in serious trouble for not doing it.  It also feels strange to be writing re-curring tasks like "check email" on a list that has a date a week hence when you know you'll most likely be doing it in a couple of hours at the most.<br><br>So numbering rather than dating sounds like a fix to this kind of confusion.  But I think you are right that since it's so easy to buy a calendar and start using it that it seems silly to make up a new way of doing it.  We just need to try your method for at least a month and a new habit will form.<br><br>I also wasn't one of those people that had my list spread over 30+ pages before, so knowing I will soon be doing just that is a bit unnerving.<br><br>However, while I thought AF4 was the best, I did tend to leave things above the line of demarcation too long and the automatic dismissal of this new system is something I think will be of great benefit once people get used to it.  As you always say: trust the system!<br><br>Like Alan, I am using my same blank notebook, but unlike Alan I simply jotted "2/9" and so on through "2/28" in the top corner of each page before a divider (which could be anything--a sticky note even) and "3/1" and so on after the divider so it doesn't feel like a calendar to me, just a different way of organizing the notebook I was already using.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Jim</div>

<div class="content">Dated or not, each active page becomes more urgent as they approach the front of your list.  <br><br>One tweak I would make to the dated approach arises because I like today's date to be a record of what I worked on today.  By this system, Today+7 is the record of today's work (everything you work on gets re-entered 7 days from now), except tasks you complete don't get entered on that date.  <br><br>To solve that, I might skew the dates backward so that I'm dismissing pages 7 days old, and re-entering worked-on tasks on today.  I fear this might ruin the psychology of things because Today's date might feel like things I ought to do today when in fact by this adjustment last Wednesday contains the things I _must_ work on.  Or maybe with the right mindset, all past-dated tasks will feel neglected and I won't put them off 7 days at a time because every one of those will make me feel guilty for not getting them done on time :-)  I understand though "done on time" is not an element of this system, and the dates are more psychological than obligations.</div>

Mark are you adding tasks that must be done today to today's list? Or do you use a separate list or no list at all and just do them? I don't mean tasks that obviously go on a calendar, like something you have to do next Wednesday. I mean I write this post and I tell you that if I don't hear back from you by the end of the day, something AWFUL will happen.

<div class="content">Having been an enthusiastic experimenter of all of the AF variations as well as with DIT (my favourite)  I've had a different reaction to Mark's latest invention.

<div class="content">Simon,<br><br>I came VERY close to making the same mistake. I think I would have redated the tasks to 30 days out (easy with Outlook tasks: move one and a single drag and drop for all the rest).<br><br>You have some other options:<br><br>1.Give the day you chose special treatment as an honorary month out (means you'll have to keep checking it as it slips back to 3 weeks in the past) Probably not Ideal. See also 3. below.<br><br>2. Prune back to a level you can reasonably expect to do in a week, Where necessary, replace all the tasks in a project/ role with a single "plan project/ role" task. When you execute that task, put the individual actions a month out.<br><br>3.Declare a backlog for all the tasks on that page and start afresh (effectively the same as 1. Better if you recognise it as a backlog and make it your Current Initiative)<br><br>4. Work like fury to clear a month's tasks in a week. Might be feasible if you can temporarily cut off the flow of new tasks. <br><br>Most of these seem excessive reactions to a simple administrative error. I'd only consider them if you want to take the opportunity to clear out your lists before starting the trial in earnest.<br><br>It's funny how I'm naturally thinking of the present as fixed while the tasks in the diary roll towards me. With AF2, it felt like I was frantically stumbling forward with the Inexorable Line Of Doom snapping at my heels. I rather like the idea of the clear eyed hero standing firm as he faces down the advancing hordes.</div>

<div class="content">Mark, I was hesitant to use the system since it just appeared against the spirit of DIT-a to-do or must-do list.  I gave it a shot, and even though it looks like I'm working on a weekly to-do list, I have to say not bad.  <br>Now I'm eager to try playing with different intervals.  What if I didn't put the large list a month out, but 3 weeks out or 5 weeks out?  Or my 1-week list became a 4 day list.  I wonder what motivates people to do the max work here?  <br>I've also thought of adding an auxiliary list of minor tasks that I can refer back to when I'm bored.  This auxiliary list would be composed of things I might like to do but really don't require doing them in the near future or dismissing them.  A good example would be a book I'm contemplating reading.<br>Brilliant Sir, brilliant.</div>

<div class="content">Mark, do you think it might be worth it to restate the instructions again?  It would give you an excuse to close this thread, if nothing else.  :-)<br><br>Here are some things that I think need to be restated / clarified:<br><br>5. All active pages are treated as if they were one long list and you continue to circulate round them doing the tasks that stand out.<br><br>First - what is an "active page"?  It's clear to me now that this means all pages between today and today + 1M.  But when I first read the instructions, it wasn't so clear.<br><br>Second - "circulate round them" wasn't clear to me either.  I got the impression this was an area where you wanted us to experiment and process the list, "circulating round", in whatever method made sense for us.  So, I treated each page in AF1 fashion (less the AF1 dismissal rules); and I figured other people would come up with their own algorithm.  Turned out this wasn't what you had in mind.  Rather, you've now made it clear that you intended that we should go through each item in the list, beginning to end, and work on whatever items "stand out" / "feel ready to be done".<br><br><br>A few other things...  How do you begin each day?  It seems there are several things that need to be done:<br><br>(1) Dismiss/delete the tasks from pages before today's page.<br><br>(2) Experimental exception to (1), if you've been away from your list for a few days:  "Cross out all the days between the last 1-month page you put tasks on and the current 1-month page. Then you renumber the first day you missed to today's date, and the similarly renumber the 1-week page, then each day renumber the next pages until you catch up. That's much harder to explain in words than it actually is in practice! For example if you are away for the next 2 days (Feb 2 and 3), when you come back 1) delete Mar 2 and 3, renumber Feb 2 to Feb 4 and Feb 8 to Feb 10."   (I still can't figure out what that means, and it seems kind of tedious...  :-)<br><br>(3) Start processing the list at the beginning of today's page?  from the place you left off last time?   ???</div>

<div class="content">Right - I've taken the plunge and it seems to be going ok so far (although clearly I haven't got to the stage where items are starting to be dismissed yet).<br><br>I'm just using a notebook and writing dates along the top (bit of a hassle writing a month's worth, but now I just need to write in a new date each day).<br><br>I'm also religiously using 4 weeks (28 days) as the '1-month' point. Not much of a hassle working this out - I just move the 'bookmark' (folded down corner) forward by one day each day. As I mentioned elsewhere, this means that if the random gardening jobs I think of this Saturday as I watch the rugby ever get near to dismissal, the dismissal day will also be a Saturday and so I might have a chance of saving them from the chop.<br><br>Positives at the moment:<br> - Generally no single page (so far) ever has a huge number of uncompleted tasks, so I never feel overwhelmed when I turn to a new page<br> - I like the fact that, when I get there, there will generally be a 'bare minimum' of work I need to do to save tasks from dismissal - on really slow days saying 'I'll just do that minimum' might just be enough to get me started and for motivation to return<br>Negatives:<br> - Less effective as a filterless 'grass catcher' or task-dump, as you lose the benefit above, and also would run out of space on a day page<br> - I can see the process of physically turning through 28 pages might get irritating after a while</div>

As for not having enough pages, that's why I advised a large calendar/diary with sufficient room for two or three columns. But even then if a page fills up, then just carry on on the next one. So if I filled Mar 4th I would start writing the tasks in Mar 5th and they would count as being entered on that day.

I just think that using a calendar month makes it easier to enter tasks, and doesn't make that much difference when the few remaining items are due to expire in a month's time.

<div class="content">A few quick comments on how I'm doing so far:<br><br>1- I "feed" tasks from my old AF4 book into the 1 Month page a few at a time.  I pick the ones that seem the most urgent/important.  This should give me a "spread out" effect and each task will have the full 1 month trip.<br><br>2- I am having trouble keeping track of where I am.  When I reenter a task I sometimes put it at the end instead of the 7 day page.  It is not that I'm really that dumb, it is just that I get confused when I'm working.  (O.K. Mark, maybe I AM just that dumb ;-)<br><br>3- I don't ,know how you are handling the different number of days in the month but I'm just using the same day as today but next month for my entry point.  IOW, I will not enter anything on the 29th, 30th, or 31st of March until March 28th, etc. when they will take reentered tasks.<br><br>4- I like the effect of moving forward toward the new tasks rather than continually looking back.  This is clearly a psychological effect but I do like it.<br><br>5- The "drop dead" aspect of dismissal in this system is really more effective than the previous dismissal method.  I don't see why it SHOULD be that way, but it is.<br><br>6- I started using another Composition Book, but I decided to use a smaller Circa ring book.  It gets me back to a smaller format for one thing, but for another, there is a kind of feeling of finality in taking yesterday's page OUT of the book (and filing it elsewhere).  There is no looking back unless I want to get another book from the shelf and fish out an old page.  I keep the pages for reference and to provide me with a someday/maybe list but I'm not that motivated to rummage around in the archive book.  I'm thinking I might do that only once every month or two, at most.<br><br>7- Since my book is a smaller format and has 25 lines I divide the page in half to give me 50 "slots".  If I need more I think what I will do is use one sheet (rather than one page) per day.  This also will simplify the bookmark system and archiving system.  As it is now, with two dates on each sheet, the processes of moving the bookmarks and archiving is just a tad more fussy.  So if I use both sides of the sheet I'll have 100 small slots or 50 larger ones, depending on how this all shakes out.<br><br>8- The other advantage of the Circa system is that I have other scheduling and calendar sheets in the same book that I can add, remove, and move around as necessary.  So with the single book I can more conveniently carry, I have everything I need for scheduling in one place.  Nice.<br><br>9- Lastly, I think that in the long run it won't mater to the mechanics of the system on the numbers of days chosen.  Since I'm using dividers to separate "today", "reentry", "entry", they can be pretty much anywhere I want.  I can even go to Alan's idea of not using dates.  We'll see how it shakes out.<br><br>But that is the report for the first couple of days or so.</div>

(I was not compensated for that comment.) They stand up to re-positioning and stick out just beyond the page, but not out of the 3-ring binder. Cool! AND they are color-coded. (my little office-supply infatuation grows...) So I have four tabs down my pages: Feb, +7, March, +30. I reposition the +7 and the +30 every morning. THAT is working GREAT!<br><br>I haven't come to a day where I use up all my lines yet, but I expect it will happen. I rarely crack open my AF book on Sundays, so week to week, I will always have a blank page. My thinking is, if, say March 4 fills up today, because lots of things occur to me, then I will just continue writing onto March 5. That keeps those ideas going onto the list in the order they came up, but then I won't have 85 things that have the potential of being dismissed all on the same day. And then Sunday, usually a blank day, will kind of be the catch up place, so I'm not really moving all those tasks down and messing up the beautiful dismissal system so much.<br><br>Along those same lines, as I have "transitioned" into this new list, I purposefully avoided dumping my OLD list onto the NEW for that very reason. I would have had over 100 things expiring on March 2! Yeeks! So I originally put "old AF list" on March 2 (because I started on Feb 2), and that meant for me to cycle through my old book and put 10 things that stood out for me onto Feb 9. (I actioned it, so it went 1 week out from Feb 2). I will keep RE-entering "old AF list" until it is all transferred over, 10 things at a time.</div>

<div class="content">Mike, re #2 use colored bookmarks (or post-its, thanks Allison).  <br>Blue for new on page 30. <br>Red for hot on page 7.<br><br>BTW, I favor using dates myself.  I only mentioned the page number thing because people were thinking "if it says Feb 23, I won't do it until Feb 23".</div>

Rationally, I evaluate DWM and it is effective at managing tasks. Emotionally, there is something very powerful land attractive about it. My self-awareness seems to be soaring.</div>

<div class="content">Alan,<br><br>It is not finding the page that is the problem.  I tend to forget what I'm doing because of the more complex rules.  It used to be that you wrote ONLY at the end of the list ... no matter what.  Now you have to think about what you are writing to decide where to write it.  (I can't walk and chew gum either ;-)</div>

<div class="content">The bookmarks are for visual cues what to do on the page.  Blue=New Blue=New Blue=New.  Write "ONLY NEW TASKS go here" on your bookmark.  Hope it helps.  Else nevermind.</div>

<div class="content">Annette, How about... use large pages and subdivide each page into multiple days.  Fewer pages to flip, room for fewer tasks per day.</div>

<div class="content">Annette,<br><br>How intriguing: my stereotype of a trainer doesn't have a lot of time to think about other tasks when they're in front of a class. <br><br>If you have a separate screen for desk-work, I'd strongly recommend that you use it as a second screen rather than closing the laptop. If not, do make sure you have a stand (could be a few reams of paper) and scrounge a keyboard for your laptop at least, so the screen  is at the right height.</div>

<div class="content">Annette,<br><br>The smallest book I've used is a 3x5" vertical format spiral book.  In one of those I got 15 tasks per page and so it could hold hundreds of tasks.  It fit right in my pocket with a 1/2 sized pen stuffed in the wire.  (a Zebra F-301, I think -- it stores 1/2 sized and then pulls apart to make a full sized pen when you want to write.  It comes in a fine point.)<br><br>Circa also makes a 3x5 vertical format ring book where you can pull out and archive pages if that is your thing.  With the wire spiral you just rip them out and trash them.<br><br>If you like, you could go with the hipster idea ... 3x5 cards clipped (a small "bear clip" works well) or punched to keep them together.<br><br>I went to the Composition sized book for a while and am now dropping back to a compromise between that and my 3x5 pocket spiral -- a Circa Compact.  It is about 4x7 and has the removable and pages that you can file in an archive notebook.  There are 25 lines per page and I am dividing the page in half to get two columns or 50 slots for tasks.  The advantage to that system is that it is small enough to carry and I can put different pages in it and move them around.  Lots of flexibility.<br><br>A simple steno pad is another option.  If you are a Moleskine geek, they make a "Reporter's Notebook" that is vertical format and just a bit larger than 3x5.<br><br>Options, options, options ;-)<br><br>BTW, I realize that these books are not dated but you can either date or number the pages to get the DWM system going.</div>

<div class="content">Annette,<br><br>It sounds like you only use your list for small tasks with larger tasks and projects being handled in another way.  If that is the case, maybe the majority of your work and your time isn't really discretionary and this might not work for you.   If one of the AF versions was working well, why not stick with it?</div>

<div class="content">Will:<br><br>I don't have time to consider tasks when I'm actually training - but I get about 15 minutes mid-morning and mid-afternoon, and then there's lunchtime.  This is when I need to grab a task quickly and do it.  <br><br>I don't have a separate screen or computer - just the machine I'm teaching from and demonstrating on.

I like it because it's small enough to fit in any handbag, and light.  I like the flexibility of moving pages around, and also keeping other things in the book, like notes and important info.  The only problem is that I couldn't put multiple days on one page, as Alan suggested.</div>

<div class="content">Marty:<br><br>I break larger projects down into small tasks and attempt to control them in AF or this new system.  I've been trying to get AF to work for me for a year now, and although the fact that I now have a ToDo list and work it in some fashion is a big improvement on what used to happen (ie semi-controlled chaos!) I always seemed to end up cheating the dismissal rules, for various reasons (one of which was laziness/extreme procrastination).<br><br>Maybe I just need to try harder...</div>

But I also seem to have a lot on the 1-month point.  Things crop up that seem to need to be dealt with today, though maybe I should be applying DIT principles to put them off until tomorrow where possible.  At least the tasks should be clustered at or before the 1 week and 1 month points, I see that now.</div>
