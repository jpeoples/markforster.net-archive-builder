<div class="content">Apologies if this thought has been aired already: I would not be surprised, though I can't immediately see it anywhere.<br><br>AF4 isn't the only system to which recurring and unfinished baskets can be added.  It can be added also to DWM, which becomes much simplified.  <br><br>One has a list of dated items.  Anything that's been on there for more than a month gets discarded.  One chooses from the list something (or perhaps three things) to work on.  After at least some small advance is made, a task is completed, in which case it can be ticked off altoghether; or it is placed in the recurring or unfinished baskets for further attention later.  The unfinished basket replaces entirely the need for the notion of weekly dismissal.<br><br>I'm finding this dramatically effective.</div>

<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>I had been thinking about this, too, although I had been debating with myself whether to apply a weekly dismissal to the Unfinished Tasks "basket" or not (which I HAD been applying for a month now, but I am not now sure whether it has any advantage or not).  The Recurrent Tasks, however, most probably would not be dated.<br><br>May I know what dismissal rules did you apply for the Unfinished and Recurrent Tasks?<br><br>God bless!</div>

<div class="content">So far I am finding that there is nothing in the unfinished tasks basket that isn't getting moved along within 24 hours, so there is no dismissal necessary. <br><br>What the process seems to be doing is making me more critical of the projects I start.  But once a task gets past that threshold, it gets driven more vigorously to completion.</div>
