<div class="content">As I use this new system over the past few days, I have been adding questions/post actions to the end of my list as I come across the things that seem like others have probably come across and found solutions to. Two questions:<br><br>Scanning of List<br>In reading the AF1 (before I read AF4) it looked like there was a quick prescan of the list items on the current page, and then second pass from top to select the next item to work on.  I didnt see this in AF4 (could have missed it though). Is there a recommended similiar process for AF4? I dont want to assume one way or the other as I know sometimes subtle things like this are there/not there for a reason.<br><br>Contacts/Calls<br>What are others doing about things like - have conversation with X about Y, or when on next call with X talk about Y type items?  These are the type of things that important to put in the list, if dont have the list with you, or reminder/place associated with the person/contact?  Do you pull these out into a contact/person type record/reminder system or other? Some of these things are not time specific , but are even specific - when on call with X, or after lunch with Y.<br><br>BTW - The great thing I'm liking so far that actually works for me about the AF4 system, is there is no hard landscape/time requirements or hard rules on next actions.  For someone who has ADD ,no schedule and almost no fixed scheduled daily activities at all, this works incredibly well so far.<br><br>-David P</div>

<div class="content">The scan-page before processing is good when you don't know what's on your page.  Typical with AF1.  In AF4 you only have 2 "pages".  You might scan it if you haven't seen the list in a while.  Otherwise you already know what your list has and there's no need to scan.<br><br>Somebody else can answer the other questions.</div>

<div class="content">>> Is there a recommended similiar process for AF4?<br><br>I don't. I like stumbling upon items as they come up, and then using good ol' intuition to decide if I'm going to do "a little, and often". <br><br>>> Do you pull these out into a contact/person type record/reminder system or other? <br><br>This is why elec is the way I roll. I tag tasks - related to people - with names i.e. $100 owed for last session /cohen. Also, I create breadcrumbs for almost all of my ongoing tasks in the notes section. This allows me to mindfully pick-up where I left off.</div>

<div class="content">I handle the groups of tasks in a somewhat disorganized manner.  :-(<br><br>I add tasks directly to the list.  When I find I have related tasks, I put a Post It note on my left page and give it a short title, e.g.., "Call Tony".  As I come across tasks that are specificly related, I put a tag at the end of the line [Tony] which tells me there is a list of things for Tony and I add them to the Post It which might be on another page.  I also do this if I add a new item to call Tony about.  <br><br>So I have them grouped on the Post it which provides a visual of how big that group of tasks is getting.  I also have individual entries that I come across frequently which serves as a repeated prompt to Call Tony. <br><br>If I forget that I really need a Post It it doesn't matter much.  Usually when I am going to act on one of these lists on a Post It, I do a quick scan of my whole AF list to make sure I haven't missed anything.<br><br>This works well for tasks that must be done in a particular place; for shopping lists; or as a mini project list.  <br><br>It isn't perfect, but it is easy.  It is much easier to do than it is to write about :-)</div>

<div class="content">Scanning the List<br><br>With AF4 I don't find the need to do a daily scan of the list, partly because I find the list stays quite small (approx 5 or 6 pages) so it is fairly normal for me to go through the whole thing (both closed and open) at least once per day.  As a result I've usually got a pretty good idea of what's on the list.  Occasionally if I'm up against a few urgent items I give myself permission to begin the day with a singly reverse scan of the Open List and then I switch back to normal AF4. <br><br>Contacts/Calls<br><br>For people I speak to a lot I maintain a dedicated Talk To list for each person and just put a "talk to <person>" entry on my list.  Otherwise, for the one off kind of contact, I just put a "contact <person> about <thing>" on my list.  I find this works really well.  I always put a left hand margin on my list and use it for the next action code, for example my "contact <person>..." entry actually is "C <person>:<thing>" where C is in the margin.  This makes it easy to scan the whole list and pick out any contacts - sometimes I want to just deal with all my outgoing calls or emails and scan the list for these, afterwards going back to normal processing.  This processing tweak still fits within the rules as I'm actually choosing not to do any other items as I scan through the list.<br><br>Hope that makes sense.</div>
