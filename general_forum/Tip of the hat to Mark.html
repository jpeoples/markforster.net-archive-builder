<div class="content">For a few years now, I've shared postcard sized quotes via Readwise with my clients. It's a quick way to illustrate a point, and leave it with them if they want to go deeper with the material. My sense is they really like the Instagram-ish nuggets, so I decided to create a blog around the idea. And once I did that, I refreshed my entire site. I'm pretty stoked about the results. <br><br>All this to say, one of Mark's quotes is featured (and more will follow): <br><br><a href="http://nadigel.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://nadigel.com</a><br><br>p.s. Anyone in touch with Mark? I haven't seen him post/comment in a while.</div>

<div class="content">Great site update! <br><br>I really like the image of you surrounded by your favorite books. I always love seeing people's bookshelves. I think it establishes context and possible connection in such a fast and unique way. <br><br>Readwise is a new app for me, and I have been loving it. I'm a sucker for pithy quotes and highlights, and it serves them up in such a great way.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Scott. Based on your comment, the image did what it was supposed to do. <br><br>Most people don't know Bowen Family Systems, or Systems Theory, but they're very aware of Esther Perel's work.</div>
