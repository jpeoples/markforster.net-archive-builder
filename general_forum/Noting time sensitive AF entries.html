<div class="content">My husband started using AF a few days ago and we talked about how to handle time sensitive entries.  I told him I was thinking of highlighting them in a different color from those that I dismiss.  <br><br>He said it would overly complicate the system as he would never be able to keep with the highlighters let alone remember what color to use!<br><br>After talking about it, we thought drawing an X to the left coloring in the top and bottom of the X so it would look like an hourglass.<br><br>Then, because we like things very simple, we hit on just drawing a triangle and inking it in for added emphasis.<br><br>That will work well for me.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mary<br><br>One thing I've found is that adding anything to the system can overcomplicate it but also I've found that adding any form of notation or tag to the left of the item can be distracting when scanning through them.  I've found that adding any form of additional notation as a suffix works better, in that the items can still be scanned easily or you can quickly scan down the list to identify those tagged items.<br><br>For example, any email items that need action and end up in my list are suffixed -AFe and post items -P.  That is also my way of identifying where I will find the relevant document/email etc.<br><br>Just another thought ..... :-)</div>

<div class="content">Why not just add the item to your calendar if it is time sensitive.  If it is due on a certain date add it to that dated page of your calendar (Project X due) and then check ahead on your calendar as a daily task first thing in the morning to see what is coming up in the next few days or weeks.  Most calendars have a yearly fold out kind of thing where you can see the whole year (also months in many cases) and so you can just mark the days where there are hot items and flip to those dates to see what's up.<br><br>Alternatively, you could put a notation on the due date and back into various things that should be done earlier so you won't get hit with it all at once.<br><br>That said, your hourglass idea is pretty neat ;-)</div>

<div class="content">I too really recommend keeping time sensitive material in a calendar or schedule or tickler file (if it relates say to a bill payment for example. I think also Mark has recommended this somewhere in the Forum. I have an entry in AF which says check schedule which I complete and re-enter every day.<br><br>Personally I also add, if it is appropriate, an action to my AF list which relates to the scheduled task, e.g. prepare papers for tax return or buy birthday card for brother so that it keeps the item moving.<br><br>I have been using AF since Day 1 and these methods have not let me down yet!!</div>

<div class="content">First, any scheduled events get put on a calendar.  Part of my routine when I arrive at work is to check my calendar.  For these items, alarms or reminders are also helpful.<br><br>Anything that has a deadline also goes on the calendar.  If it is way in the future, I will also put a reminder on the calendar ahead of the due date to add it to the AF list.  This is for items that are so far in the future that they might otherwise get dismissed by following the rules.  For those that are due sooner, they go right on the list (and also on the calendar as a safety net).<br><br>When any task with a deadline is added to AF, I put the due date to the right of it in brackets like this:  [Due 2March].  That way I not only see the item repeatedly, but also see the due date.  The due date is really part of defining the task.<br><br>Sometimes I add a small post it note to my bookmark for a new item that is due the same day.  (The item is still added to the last page where it belongs.)  That way I don't need to worry about not getting to the last page.  I am inconsistent with this tweak.  Often it is only for items I am afraid of forgetting or if I know I won't make it through to the last page.  With enough advance notice for a task, this is not necessary and clearly goes against the instructions.<br><br>We all have slightly different styles and that results in slightly different approaches while using the same basic guidelines. Sometimes I need to use some of the above tweaks to help me through something knowing that I will drop them when they no longer are helpful. Making those choices knowing that they are temporary sometimes reduces stress that has become a temporary hindrance to performance. Personally, I see nothing wrong with that. It is just part of my own common sense rule.<br><br>--<br>Marty</div>

<div class="content">Great tips!  Right now I'm using a small moleskin for my home AF notebook and I have a small pocket calendar that fits inside.  I use it for social events - it's too small to hold more than one item/day.  I may move to a larger notebook that could house a bigger calendar - I have to keep them together.  AF and a calendar are keeping me sane!<br><br>Thank you all for the replies.</div>

<div class="content">Howdy. I just found this site and find it interesting. My one question has to do with the digital form of AF. I have been using Chandler 1.0.2 and it seems to combine the to-do lists, priorities and calendar. Has anyone else used this?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Rich<br><br>I just had a quick look at the program you mentioned.  It looks a great program but as far as I could see doesn't have the flexibility of multiple closed lists (pages).  <br><br>As you are new to site I'm guessing you haven't had a chance to use the system yet.  If you give it a try for a while you will see the reason for the concept of closed lists which is fundamental to AF.  AF works really well with just a common notebook - which also makes it very quick (and inexpensive!) to start so give it a go and see what you think .......</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Christine. No, I haven't had a chance. I travel a lot, and this past trip (2100 miles in four days) with a very sore back has not left me in the mood to try new things. But I have every intention after my 1400 mile trip next weekend. I do have a small moleskine to experiment with in the meantime.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Rich<br><br>Sounds like a pretty tough schedule - and definitely not fun with a bad back!  AF works best with discretionery time, which I know from experience can be a little limited when you are travelling.  Make sure you add some fun stuff into your book as well - it helps to have a variety of tasks, routines, general work tasks, leisure tasks, email, and just Thinking Time. Scheduled tasks stay outside of AF which I suspect takes up a lot of your travelling time but those hours at airports also have some potential, even if only for adding items in preparation for your return.  Best of luck ....</div>

<div class="content">Thanks. Just to clarify: most of my travel is by auto, with me doing the driving. I do have two flights scheduled (one in late April and another in June); everything else in the next three months is driving. Love the work, not necessarily the driving. LOL</div>

<div class="content">Driving is a great time to listen to audio books. There are many CDs available in public libraries as well as for purchase or download.  Maybe your driving time could be used to listen to inspiring (in the morning) or entertaining (in the evening) material.<br><br>Another possibility is to use the trip for thinking time and carry a portable voice recorder to capture ideas (and items for your AF list).</div>

<div class="content">Wow - that's a lot of driving!  Charles's ideas of audio books and thinking time are good ones.  Perhaps we should have some AF audio books - "Tales of the Unexpected" or "In the AF Zone" .....?  Any volunteers?</div>

<div class="content">You can make Chandler do closed lists by setting up a new collection for each page. Or, probably more effectively, by using a note as a page.<br><br>It's not the fastest program though, and hasn't quite gone where it was expected to go when it started.<br><br>Other big note+tasks+calendar programs include Spicebird (uses Thunderbird+Lightning underneath), EssentialPIM (free and commercial versions) and Do-Organizer (not free). I have them all installed (or available as portable versions, which I prefer) as well as Outlook (and others) but don't think I would use any of them to run AF. Do-Organizer comes closest. The problem with all of them is that inputting tasks can be quite time consuming because of setting dates, options etc - and they are not designed to use a number of closed lists (though workarounds are usually possible); and using the notes sections as pages means that striking though an item takes more than a single click. They also have quite a big general overhead (though it varies a lot between them), which is fine if you have them always on but not if you will often load them just for AF.<br><br>I much prefer using a computer based way of operating AF, but believe that doing it successfully means that the solution has to be quick and light with features/interface etc that suit you well as an individual.</div>

<div class="content">Do-Organizer is an excellent program (but has a few issues under Vista) and I agree with Dm that setting it up for AF is not a time efficient option.  It is a fantastic program used as is but is not sufficiently flexible enough to tailor easily.  <br><br>OneNote works well for me on the Desktop but the mobile version is pretty limited.</div>
