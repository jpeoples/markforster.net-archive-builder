<div class="content">I don't really understand the logic of AF2, maybe there is none?<br><br>Imho, the dismissal or not of items is still too dependant on the way you happen to add your tasks in your list. And that means you randomly act on tasks, in sequence or not. Consequently, the last block of not-acted-on tasks will vary, sometimes it will be one, other times it might be ten. It depends of the lenght of the list, how much time you have had to deal with your list.<br><br>I started with my old long AF list, which might not be the best way. Anyway, I will end up with a long list sooner or later - I have lots of ideas I want to put into my secure(?) system.<br>Sometimes, I will get one item to put on-notice for dismissal, sometimes it may be, say, 10 at one time. That's depending on where the previous last completed item happens to be!<br>That is too random behaviour for my well-being.<br><br>I've been thinking! ;-)<br>One tweak for me may be to limit the block to maximum 3 items at a time.<br><br>And the next thought: why not always take the last 3, regardless of where other ready items are, and put these 3 'on-notice' for dismissal?<br><br>Will 'orthodox AF2' be better than this approach?<br>And if you think so - why?<br>I'm really interested if AF2 has some hidden magic of some fuzzy logic that I have missed.<br></div>

<div class="content">Right now the sequence  of my items is totally at random. But my effort on the items is not at random, some items will be neglected, some will thrive. Hopefully a pattern will evolve at the end of the list, though not necessarily a logic one. This pattern is supposed to tell me something about my priorities (hopefully, again).</div>

<div class="content">For the most part my items are totally random.  My brain goes in 50 directions at once and my boss randomly throws things for me to do in large chunks.  But, in the end, AF2 seems to get the work done without me forgetting anything (a huge problem when I used other systems).  To put everything in logical order every time I'm given, or think of, a new task would take too much time out of my day.<br><br>In regards to dismissal.  Part of my daily review (when I 1st open my list) is looking at items that will be on notice for tomorrow & seeing if any of those can be accomplished today without throwing me out of production mode.  It usually just means adding one more task with my arrow & work it as fast as I can.  I've not had more than 1 item up for dismissal working it this way.</div>

<div class="content">Jabbe:<br><br>The number of items up for dismissal is far from random. The great advantage of AF2 is that it imposes order on random tasks. This also applies to dismissal.<br><br>Bear in mind that you are working with a list that was produced under a different system so the distribution of tasks on the early pages will not be as it would have been if you had been using AF2.<br><br>Under AF2 the number of tasks which are put on notice for dismissal is dependent on a number of factors of which the most important are:<br><br>a) How well randomized the tasks were when they were entered into the list. This is why I recommend entering tasks when you think of them or when they come up in the normal course of work. Dumping a large block of backlog tasks into the list will probably result in them being dismissed in large blocks too.<br><br>b) What percentage of time was spent near the beginning of the list. If tasks were well randomized when entered they will tend to be broken up into fairly small packets. When there is time available to move back through the list then these packets will be further broken up or eliminated altogether. When there is not time to move back, the packets will remain larger. This means that dismissing tasks is very responsive to the work situation.<br><br>In general therefore the AF2 dimissal rules have the following results:<br><br>1) A large number of backlog or dumped tasks will be rejected, thus preventing the system from being overloaded.<br><br>2) When there is little time to deal with anything but urgent items, dismissal will move quite quickly which allows you to prioritise your workload as you begin to get out of the urgent phase.<br><br>3) When more time becomes available dismissal acts more slowly - in fact may well cease altogether.</div>

<div class="content">Thank you, Mark, I understand and accept your explanation of the logic of AF2. It makes sense. I will give it a fair chance, by starting from zero again.<br>I will still keep my old items in a maybe/possible list, and check that once in a while to see if there are new candidates for AF2 list.<br><br>AF2 feels better than the original version, and I'll be back with more experience later, positive or constructive, fwiw.</div>

<div class="content">I'm not really sure if AF2 is working for me or not.<br><br>I think I may have mentioned before that none of my tasks are able to be dismissed, full stop - they all have to be done.<br><br>I have used my old AF1 list, bringing it forward to AF2, which is completely random... but cannot apply any of the dismissal rules.<br><br>I just feel therefore that I am working my way backwards through a random open-ended to-do list.<br><br>Help!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jason<br><br>I do not dismiss many tasks as I genuinely feel that most need to be done but the reason for that "doing" may vary in importance.  For example I may decide I can't dismiss "empty dishwasher" but in the grand scheme of things it is not an immensely important task.  Something like "write report" may also not be able to be dismissed.  The big advantage of AF - and the dismissal principle, whichever version you use, is that, by being a rule, you have to examine why the item is on your list and why it is not being done.<br><br>If you genuinely believe the task must be done the reasons for not doing a task will usually fall into a limited number of categories.<br><br>(1) Item cannot be done because the time/location is not right.  In that case dismiss and/or set up a reminder. <br>(2) Waiting for someone/something else. In that case rephrase as a follow up type item to monitor status until the conditions are right.<br>(3) Procrastination.  If the only reason is procrastination then there will be a reason - and possibly not specifically related to the task at issue.  For example a 2 minute telephone call may be resisted because of a fear of conflict, post may not be opened for fear of the contents, a report may be resisted because of lack of confidence in ability.  AF is amazingly helpful in these scenarios - the resisted items cannot just be ignored in a never ending list - they "must" be done or dismissed.  That very rule becomes the catalyst to make us look at the reason for our reticence - ignoring the rule removes that major benefit and turns AF into just a to do list.<br><br>Hope that may help?</div>
