<div class="content">As I explore, as I am wont to do, each of Mark's various TMs, I'm struck by how certain systems seem to be associated or identified with specific quintessential aspects, specifically in how they make the user feel when using the system. <br><br>For example, NL-FVP is a system that Mark has commented on creating the feeling of being "totally satisfied" with a day by the end of it. Similarly, Mark has said that AF is "quite unlike" any other system, in that it gives a sense of "calm and control". I don't know what Mark would specifically say about NQ-FVP, but I'm imagining something like "a sense of doing the right thing at the right time without resistance." I think 5/2 was identified as "powerful, concentrated, disciplined." <br><br>So, I'm wondering, has anyone ever tried to list out various time systems from Mark with a corresponding short phrase that summarizes not the mechanics, but the emergent feelings associated with working that system? Do any of you think that would be useful? I know I would find such a list fascinating.</div>

<div class="content">Simple Scanning: "Everything is easy."<br><br>By the way, speaking of TM systems, perhaps it's time to update that page? (Users could help so Mark doesn't have to do all the work.) Some systems are missing: e.g. Simple Scanning and "What am I resisting not doing?" Or perhaps a comprehensive list isn't realistic, given that Mark has come up with so many ideas.</div>
