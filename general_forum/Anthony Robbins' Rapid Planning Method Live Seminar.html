<div class="content">This is great.  I've been incorporating elements of TRs methods lately. Particularly chunking.  This has made my chaotic lists much more manageable. Also, my method of using get___ to write tasks allow me to clearly define outcomes on the fly. I will be taking his RPM more seriously and will check out more links from him. Thanks Michael.</div>

<div class="content">I often chunk using hyphens  if I can't clearly determine a single encompassing chunk task. Like: task a-task d-task e-task b. <br><br>Overall, I think the most important aspect of RPM is to be outcome oriented, purpose driven, motivational and achievable with all of your task writing.  Also, it's important to tackle your high impact tasks early and eliminate low priority tasks /accept that you simply won't get it all done.  I strongly believe that by understanding the outcome and purpose of each task on a list will clearly tell you what is and is not a priority.  <br><br>Also, I like to review my high impact tasks and deliberately come up with an excuse as to why I can't do it 'now'. Sometimes my excuses are clearly bogus and that is what highlights what I'm procrastinating on! <br><br>I've went back to old school methods in task management lately. That is, have visions/oucomes for your life, have goals, write actions for it, identify the high priority items, schedule them on a calendar and take massive action on them. I've made this a routine because its simple and it works. all other tasks that creep onto your list will only get done if its a priority. <br><br>Chunking and outcome driven actions turns out to be all the organization I need.  And the fact that I have one easy accessible list to write every and anything makes it much less stressful. <br><br>Again, thanks for shedding light to the forum and for reinforcing simple techniques to get things done.</div>

<div class="content">I've played with RPM - on and off - for a few years. I've incorporate some of the principles, but found the daily upkeep to be do time consuming. <br><br>Anyone doing RPM on a daily basis? If so, with what tools?</div>

<div class="content">Based on the visuals... I think this is what RPM users are looking for. However I'd like to see more coaching/education included in the software. Covey's PlanPlus had this for during the Weekly Planning process, which set it apart from other project/task software. The online aspect is a total turn-off for me. I look forward to playing with it, but will probably return to my hybrid (analog) system. To date, incorporating aspects of: <br><br>* Brian Tracy's Goals program<br>* B. Westerman's Getting Sh-t Done<br>* Danny Gregory's The Creative License<br>* Godin/Ziglar's Goals program<br>* M. Forster's spirit infuses a lot of how I think about what/how I do things <br>* My own special tweaks :)<br><br>If I keep at this for a few more weeks, I'll create/post a video.</div>

<div class="content">Michael- Wow, I signed up and can't wait. Good eyes and ears my friend. I don't know how I missed this.  I'm really a 'fan' of TR and RPM. But like Avrum, have found RPM a bit difficult to maintain daily. So Ive just picked at the best principles and made hybrid systems that suited me better. <br><br>Avrum-  "Really dig the spirit, and technique, of Get ____" <br><br>Thanks. I think at the time I explained it , half of the forum members didn't understand the reasoning behind it and thought it was unnecessary overhead. One person said 'its the worst idea in the universe' lol. Somewhere on this site someone wrote that.  Admittedly, I can see where they were coming from because it does feel unnecessary at times, but as I've gotten used to it over time, it has saved me a whole lot of wasted time determining whats important from whats not and what my outcome truly is.<br><br>I think it didnt quite fly with the MF forum, because MF systems encourage rapid capture and rapid (gut feeling) action through little and often on what you think is meant by a task. Whereas, TR encourages rapid capture, chunk and define an outcome, clearly reinforce that outcome with a logical reason (why do i have this gut instinct?/ why do i want to do this? etc. to build motivation) and then do it.</div>

To me they have always sounded great in theory but in practice are just too inflexible and overwhelming. In fact it was my complete lack of success with a similar system that led me to develop my own methods in the first place.</div>

<div class="content"><<To me they have always sounded great in theory but in practice>><br><br>RPM definitely falls into this category. GTD is full of platitudes - that seem to be lapped up by people who are desperate for a sense of control and calm. <br><br>However, the idea that our lives are best lived by outcomes vs managing tasks is a sound idea. <br><br>Personally, I go back and forth between DWM & GSD. Currently doing GSD.</div>

<div class="content">avrum:<br><br><< However, the idea that our lives are best lived by outcomes vs managing tasks is a sound idea. >><br><br>I guess I sort of agree with you on that. But isn't the outcome implicit in the task anyway? If I put "Gardening" on my task list, does that mean that unless I have been through some intense visioning sessions I am going to misunderstand the task to mean that I want to make my garden as overgrown and as ugly as possible? What does identifying a vision of "having a beautiful garden" actually add to the task? The fact that I've put "Gardening" on the list shows that I already have that vision - I don't need to spell it out.</div>

<div class="content"><< But isn't the outcome implicit in the task anyway? >><br><br>Tony's idea - as I understand it - works like this... let's say I dump the following tasks onto a list: <br><br>workout<br>buy exercise shoes <br>salad<br><br>All of the following are related to health. If my outcome/value is: Live and be healthy, than it doesn't matter if I "workout", "buy exercise shoes", etc., so long as I'm doing something... anything to advance: Live and be healthy. Most to-do systems reward you for checking things off a list. Tony suggests you create a list, but don't concern yourself if you've accomplished everything - or anything - on the list so long as you're staying true to your outcome/vision. <br><br>I can appreciate this idea. There are many days where I'm "productive" in crossing many things off my list, but feeling the day was unfulfilling. And other days, where I don't even look at a list, but go to sleep with a sense of pride and accomplishment. How to get more of the latter, and less of the former, is what I'm after.</div>

<div class="content">@avrum<br><br>I was wondering if you could write a few lines about your implementation of "Getting Sh-t Done"?  I learnt about it on this site and I like the idea a lot, however when I briefly tried it out a few weeks ago I found that having a master list and a separate daily list added an extra layer of complication which is not present in most MF systems.  I'm currently successfully using Andreas' DSAF.<br><br>Thanks!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Keith - <br><br>Here's what I do: <br><br>I take an average sized index card, and dump whatever tasks/errands are on my mind the night before, and following AM. I also transfer (re-write) any unfinished tasks onto the card. I place a number next to tasks that haven't been touched to indicate how many times I'm re-entering the item. The idea being that, as the number climbs, I'll either kick my a@@ to get it done, or drop it. Either way, the number keeps me honest. I may look at the list, I may not. But at the end of the day, anything that isn't finished, that needs to be finished, gets rewritten on tomorrow's cards. Here's what works for me: <br><br>* the re-writing refreshes, on the one hand, and annoys on the other. Both keep me honest<br>* the clean slate of an index card, and brain dump, keep things fresh. <br>* low overhead i.e. no contexts, fancy rules, etc<br><br>The master list is used as a placeholder.</div>

<div class="content">Usually I write it on the bottom of the week list. That page is handy, and my system handles it. If I don't expect to do it this week, and that page is getting full, I might prepare next week's page and put it there. If it's a future reminder, I put it in the tickler. Other times, i write it on the current page, and "doing" the task actually means putting it in the tickler.</div>

<div class="content">Keith - <br><br>Truthfully, I've moved past the minutiae of task management. I'm far more concerned about accountability towards my major goals (I do this via a variation of Godin/Ziglars suggestion to: At the end of the day, journal about each major goal i.e. Successes, failures, What you'll differently tomorrow). However, if all new tasks are added to todays index card. At the end of the day, any non-actioned tasks either get moved to the master list, or carried forward to a new index card.</div>

To me it's analogous to a step in a recipe but not knowing what you're cooking. Or a direction miles west on the freeway but not knowing your destination. <br><br>I think it's advantageous to just know your purpose/outcome/goal upfront, decide if its worthy of your time and effort 'now' and then start in it. I think doing an action without knowing the purpose first is a waste of these resources ( time, effort and money if needed).<br><br>Which vision/long term/action system did you use and what was the primary reason you stopped using it? I too have been on and off with these systems but because I was honestly not disciplined enough to sit down and do critical thinking and planning. Now I'm reintroducing that into my life and I'm much happier.</div>

<div class="content">Avrum:<br><br>"If you've got an inside scoop, perhaps you can share when BETA invites are being distributed."<br><br><br>... I only have an outside scoop! Once the software is out of litigation BETA invites will likely be sent. <br><br>So that you can follow up, I've detailed the sequence of my research and the results below:<br><br><br>1. First, I did a web and Apple App Store search for RPM, Rapid Planning Method, OPA, Anthony Robbins planning, Tony Robbins planning, OPA Life Planner, and RPM Life Planner.<br><br>2. Then I did a trademark search for "RPM" resulting in this: <a href="http://www.trademarkia.com/rpm-rapid-planning-method-85245482.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.trademarkia.com/rpm-rapid-planning-method-85245482.html</a><br><br>3. Next, I found this survey: <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/TimeMgmtSystem" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/TimeMgmtSystem</a><br><br>4. Later, I located the survey results. They showed that most people liked both "Rapid Planning Method" and "TimeMaster" as titles.<br><br>5. I followed up with a trademark search for "TimeMaster RPM" and "TimeMaster Rapid Planning Method": <a href="http://www.trademarkia.com/rpm-time-master-85500986.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.trademarkia.com/rpm-time-master-85500986.html</a><br><br>6. The trademark for "RPM TimeMaster" was filed on Wednesday, December 21, 2011. No movement in nearly a year... hmm. Then I came across these two links (scroll to the bottom of the second link for current status on the trademark): <br><br><a href="http://www.trademarks411.com/marks/85500986-rpm-time-master" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.trademarks411.com/marks/85500986-rpm-time-master</a><br><br><a href="http://trademarks.justia.com/855/00/rpm-time-master-85500986.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://trademarks.justia.com/855/00/rpm-time-master-85500986.html</a><br><br>7. Next, I searched for "TimeMaster RPM" which resulted in: <a href="http://lifemastersolutions.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://lifemastersolutions.com</a><br><br>8. Then I did a web search for "Tony Robbins software lawsuit" as the trademark process had been stalled. This article was the result: <a href="http://garrycrystal.blogspot.com/2012/04/tony-robbins-versus-tony-berkman-deal.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://garrycrystal.blogspot.com/2012/04/tony-robbins-versus-tony-berkman-deal.html</a><br><br>9. I read a second article for background on one of the parties involved in the lawsuit: <a href="http://garrycrystal.blogspot.com/2011/11/blogcatalog-owners-silencing-writers.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://garrycrystal.blogspot.com/2011/11/blogcatalog-owners-silencing-writers.html</a><br><br>10. Finally, I called Robbins Research International and asked to be put in touch with an expert on the RPM binder at the company. They put me on the line with a man named Kay. Kay informed me that he used to work with Anthony Robbins personally. I asked him if Tony used his own system. "Yes", he said. Then I asked if Tony still uses the binder, "The last time I saw Tony use the binder is when I fetched it for him in 2005. He'd left it behind before traveling", he replied. I told him about the LifeMaster Solutions website, the term "TimeMaster", and the lawsuit. He had no idea! He checked it out and was surprised he'd never heard of the website or this new software. He wondered how I'd found it.<br><br>Now you both know what I know!</div>

<div class="content">I believe that Anthony Robbins uses a hybrid system of paper, Mac, and iOS device. <br><br>The clues?<br><br><br>• He made it clear in the videos that as a company: "We do it on the computer, but we did it on paper for years."<br><br><br>• He said, "I've done it on paper for years" referring to his own choice of tools in the present tense.<br><br><br>• He said he uses paper throughout the week for capturing his future communications with specific people.<br><br><br>• He mentioned in one of the videos, "I've got all sorts of systems for capture".<br><br><br>• He captures everything directly into categories and suggests that others do the same instead of using a long list. Computers and binders excel at this and he referred to binders as "mini-suitcases" you "used to carry around".<br><br><br>• He said in a recent interview, "I'm a Mac man."<br><br><br>• The TimeMaster RPM website uses an iPhone graphic and mentions syncing with Apple and Google calendars.<br><br><br>• He has a long history of using a hybrid system. In the RPM audio course "The Time of Your Life" he mentions that he used the first RPM software by:<br><br><br>1. Capturing everything on paper.<br><br>2. Typing his weekly captures into the software on Sunday afternoons.<br><br>3. Creating RPM blocks for the following week.<br><br>4. Printing the blocks out for his binder.</div>

<div class="content">@avrum re <<people who are desperate for a sense of control and calm. >><br><br>i think this is the heart of the selling of these type of methods - the suggestion that life can be controlled is illusory, but, because it is innately human to want to feel safe and secure (the ultimate outcome?) people will always be drawn to anyone, or any ideology, that appears to offer it. What CAN be controlled is our free choice of how we want to feel and how we choose to react to events. As the coach Michael Neill puts it "I'll be happy when I get what I want" is the great myth of Western civilisation.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Melanie. Here are some more, maybe.<br><br>Why I don't follow Anthony Robbins<br><br>His idea of success is the acquisition model. The model of the industrial capitalist. It assumes you will be happy when you acquire what you want and dominate and control circumstances. Only then can you give yourself safety, security, happiness. And to keep going you have lots of ways to motivate yourself, and lots of motivational seminars to attend. It has an underlying assumption (or fear) that what you have is not enough to provide for your safety and security, and therefore your happiness. But it is unbalanced. It is all Alpha-male Type A personality mentality. Connection to others and expressing yourself are secondary. It downplays the quality of the journey - the pleasure to be had in self-expression and connection with others - and stresses destination.<br><br>To emphasise a journey-not-destination mentality one needs to approach the FV or AF list not with an outcome, goal or result in mind but with a "Which of these feels the most fascinating, loving, or interesting thing to do next?" mind-set. This is "success" as expressing the loving truth of who you are and your vision. A focus on outcome makes it harder to flow energy. Success needs to be the experience of the journey, not the result of it. Why? Because after any outcome you still have to look at yourself in the mirror and if you don't see someone you love who expresses themselves openly then all the money, outcomes and possessions in the world won't change that.</div>

<div class="meta">2013-05-8 20:44</div>
<div class="content">Michael, I agree. Success has to be measured during the journey, otherwise we're constantly waiting for it. Many authors say, "I'll feel like an author when I finish my first novel." When that's done, the definition becomes "when I get an agent." And so on. A path without a goal often goes nowhere, but a terrible path to a good goal is just as bad.</div>

<div class="content">Michael, another inspiring post. Thanks. You're so right about the fear. Let's face it. Robbins is a marketer. He is creating in his audiences a desire for something more so he can sell his products. I can easily get caught up in the my-life-isn't-good-enough frenzy.</div>

<div class="content">Michael, at risk sounding like a fanboi I think your perspective of Tony may be a bit off due to all of the marketing that surrounds him. If you look at the processes they're very much about the journey, overall fullfilment in your life and whatever it is you deem success to be. It's core seems to be developing focus on what's important, if that's the "acquisition model" so be it, if that's "becoming a master of feng shui and loving every second along the way" then his systems will certainly mold around that and make it better.<br><br>I don't want to come out as defending Anthony Robbins, not my interest, but I can certainly tell you I'm not a command and conquer, acquire everything I can, reach the destination at all costs kind of guy and his RPM system has fit me perfectly. Over the past 6 months have certainly helped me become a better person, husband, father and a better leader at work.</div>

<div class="content">Mitch - <br><br>I was never able to commit to the process of RPM. But the ideas behind the system are powerful, and are agnostic with respect to end goals.</div>

<div class="content">Mark Forster: "I guess I sort of agree with you on that. But isn't the outcome implicit in the task anyway? If I put "Gardening" on my task list, does that mean that unless I have been through some intense visioning sessions I am going to misunderstand the task to mean that I want to make my garden as overgrown and as ugly as possible? What does identifying a vision of "having a beautiful garden" actually add to the task? The fact that I've put "Gardening" on the list shows that I already have that vision - I don't need to spell it out."<br><br>Exactly.  But spending some time doing vision sessions and carefully wording the task on your list means you can procrastinate and avoid the gardening altogether.  This allows it to be dimissed or reworded so this process can be repeated ad infinitum, until the stress of having weeds blocking the sun from the windows forces the situation - the same thing that would happen if you just ignored the gardening anyway.<br><br>I think you underestimate how much people use these systems to absolve them of the responsibility to actually get stuff done.  Or, as I phrased it, there's far too much pushing food around the plate and not enough eating going on here.<br><br>I just get on with doing stuff and use a simple list where I need to remember things.  I'm constantly bemused - and slightly depressed - by the capacity for people in here to try and make an extraordinarly simple process into a difficult, convoluted "system".</div>

<div class="content">Chris:<br><br>Personally I need some sort of simple system, otherwise I just descend into chaos. However the key is "simple". I've always believed that a good system should be next to invisible.</div>

<div class="content">Also risking sounding like a fanboy I'll chime in ...Many of you are misinterpreting the system and are misinformed. It also seems like many of you haven't even read,tried,listened or received any understanding of the system but are judging it based on feelings.  The system can be summarized as:<br><br>Capture , chunk like things, determine the outcome of these chunks, prioritize these outcomes based on impact towards your goals/what you want, select the 20% providing 80% impact, plan it out into many discrete actionable steps and take massive action on it now and daily. <br><br>That's the results oriented, purpose driven,  massive action plan aka RPM in a nutshell. <br><br>It's a very powerful system and practice. There's no 'visioning' as what is being mentioned here.  In fact TR has actually stated many times he's not a believer of visioning that something will happen just to make it happen nor is he a fan of laziness and procrastination.  He's big on 'doing' and achieving. But doing the right things.  So yes there is some thought required to determine the right things to do, but once that's determined you must do it.</div>

<div class="content"><<A cursory glance at what TR has achieved is enough of a testimonial, no? I'm willing to wager much of the ire that TR receives is nourished in envy.>><br><br>Exactly. There really is no need to defend him. <br><br>I think a lot of people have gotten caught up with the mechanics of the task list. (Simple vs complex , efficient vs inefficient etc.   ) rather than the purpose of it. <br><br>I'd rather use a complex system that will take me to where I want to be/have what I want to have/ do what I want to do- 1 month/ 1 yr/5yrs  from now; rather than a simple system that doesn't.</div>

<div class="content"><< a lot of people have gotten caught up with the mechanics of the task list... rather than the purpose of it>><br><br>Purpose-oriented productivity is where I started (7 Habits in 2001), and where I'm currently holding. For the past few weeks, I've been curating different ideas into - what I'm calling - a meaning-making productivity system. The workflow is heavily influenced by Barbara Sher's Wishcraft, S. Covey First Things First & Danny Gregory's The Creative License.</div>

<div class="content">I was quite skeptical of Tony Robbins after the first time I listened to one of his audio programs  but on listening to it again I picked up a lot of good stuff I missed earlier through being put off by his hyper enthusiastic delivery.<br><br>But one thing which has struck me about his methods is that they have stood the test of time. I recently pulled out one of his audiobooks again and it still sounded very relevant today, although his focus is more about self management than time management. I would never buy into one of his over-priced seminars but he wouldn't command those fees over such a long period of time unless there was some value in the product.</div>

<div class="content">John:<br><br><br>"I don't understand why they take so much time, when a lot of people - <br>almost his whole clientele could be a potential customer."<br><br><br>... They don't own the software yet. It's being disputed in court. Until the case is solved and ownership established they have to wait. There are two lawsuits to be resolved before the software can be released and they may like the current software enough to not start from scratch.<br><br><br><br>"Have you spoken to this Kay you've contacted a while ago<br>again? He could have an update."<br><br><br>... No. Kay said it was the first he'd heard of the lawsuit, the new software, the new name: TimeMaster RPM, and the new website: <a href="http://lifemastersolutions.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://lifemastersolutions.com/</a> .</div>
