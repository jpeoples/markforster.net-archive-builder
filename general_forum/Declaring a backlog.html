<div class="content">Well, I finally did it: I declared a backlog on my AF4-list.<br><br>When starting AF4 I was reluctant to start a new list, and initially I've been working with my old list, consisting of ~230 tasks. I had the impression I could keep up with that, but over the past weeks I've noticed that it takes way too long to draw a new closed-list-line (7 weeks since the last time :-). Because of that, I kept working small bursts on tasks that otherwise I would have dismissed weeks ago, and as a result my list kept getting longer and longer.<br><br>So now I'm back to a fresh list, with 33 tasks over 2 pages. Heaven!</div>

<div class="content">Oh, and I put a task "work on old AF backlog" on my new list.</div>

<div class="content">Nicole, doesn't this work against one of the things Mark mentioned that was part of AF4 - which was only having current work/projects on the list?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline,<br><br>I don't think it goes against Mark's statement that only current work should be on the list, because I really do intend to work an hour or so a week on the old backlog, or at least review it that often.  Before I declared the backlog I was working against the spirit of only current work on the list, because I wouldn't get to a lot of those tasks for weeks.  With the new list, I hope to be able to keep it more current than it was.</div>

<div class="content">I agree with Nicole. The whole point of declaring a backlog is to keep the active list fresh.<br><br>Need to do something similar myself...</div>

<div class="content">When I moved onto AF4 I had a pretty large backlog, around 40 pages.  I tried it in the list, but never made any progress at all - too depressing/daunting/... and other words beginning with d.  Then I removed it and started from a clean slate - didn't work at all for me, I suffered a lot of stress about the significant stuff on the old list that was now out of sight/out of mind and would never be seen again.<br><br>What worked for me was putting one or two (max) pages of the backlog into my filofax (easier with a ring binder of course) at a time.  This meant that my closed list was running around five pages long.  I cleared my backlog in four to five weeks.</div>

<div class="content">Interesting that the backlog thing is similar to Christine B's Unicycles and Tandems.  <br><br>I would have thought that having a backlog would have been a signal to do a DIT style audit.<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2008/2/29/auditing-your-time-management.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2008/2/29/auditing-your-time-management.html</a></div>

<div class="content">Simon,<br><br>that's an encouraging result, and a way of working that I have considered but not implemented yet. Thanks for reminding me, I'll try that.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Nicole,<br><br>I did the same thing myself a few days ago.  Works much better than trying to continue dealing with hundreds of leftover tasks from AF1/RAF.  Wish I had made this change at the beginning of AF4 in September.  :-)<br><br>Seraphim</div>
