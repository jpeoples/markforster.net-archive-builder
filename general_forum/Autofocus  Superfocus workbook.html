<div class="content">Has anyone implemented autofocus or superfocus in a loose leaf binder like a filofax?  I'm just pondering the pros and cons (i.e. you can remove all dismissed pages and archive, you can have your planner in the same binder).<br><br>I use my filofax as a planner/diary so it could work to have my task lists in there too.</div>

<div class="content">Though not absolutely necessary a loose-leaf binder would work well with my Final Version, which has variable page lengths. <br><br>That's given another clue!</div>

<div class="content">Intriguing thank you Mark. I have every intention of trying out your new system when it becomes available so that could sway me to make a start in that direction.</div>
