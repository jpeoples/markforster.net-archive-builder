<div class="content">Anyone tried implementing SuperFocus electronically yet?<br><br>I'm using MyLifeOrganized (Desktop + Blackberry). I've been trying out a few different ideas over the past few days but I don't feel I've reached a comfortable software-based approach yet.</div>

<div class="content">I'm not going to try. I did AF1 for a while on paper and then tried to do it electronically. While functionally I could get it to work (setting different lists as pages and being able to see crossed out tasks were the main technological hurdles) I found that you really lose something doing AF1 without a notebook, and I imagine it would be the same with Superfocus.<br><br>I have implemented and am using AF4 on the computer (using Toodledo) and it has worked well. I incorporated the three task add-on method last week and it has been superb. <br><br>But, I believe that AF1 and any supercharged version thereof loses its power when not done on physical paper.</div>

<div class="content">Might I suggest MS Word?  Create a table with 1 row and 2 columns, and just go!  Start a new table row when the page is full.  There's a button to cross out text, and it's easy to copy and paste stuff around.<br><br>Or plain Excel also works, if you limit the number of rows.<br>Or OneNote.  Anything freeform.<br><br>But I can't see task management systems doing very well for this, because SAF has a unique structure and they all have a different structure.</div>

Find it hard to contemplate manual SAF after getting nicely hooked on his user-friendly digital DWM.xls.<br><br>WE NEED YOU WALTER! At least some of us do.</div>

<div class="content">I've thought about this some. I think whatever you did for DWM or AF1 may work. Mostly, the two-column aspect of SAF isn't very important. What matters is that you can add tasks in two places: the current page and the last page, and that you have a way to decide a page is full, or you need to start a new page.  And you need the ability to add tasks on any page.<br><br>So just have multiple groups for your tasks, and always add tasks to either the current group or the last one. In a calendar system(but doing SAF), add to the active date or the newest open date.  Just ignore the dates. <br><br>And remember to stop adding new things to the last group when it's "half-full".</div>

<div class="content">I find Outlook tasks seems to work fine. I cripple it by using due date to refer only to the page of the "notebook" and use the "importance" flag to indicate a column 2 task (flagged as "low")</div>

<div class="content">Taskpaper might work well. There was a lot of discussion back in the day with a lot of folks loving it for AF1--it's very paper-like. I think you could easily fake the second column, by adding a new heading and using Project View, which shows all our top headings...</div>

<div class="content">Focuspad by Tony should work (<a href="http://7actionsdev.com/focuspad/)." target="new" rel="nofollow">http://7actionsdev.com/focuspad/).</a> I implemented it by adding a task called '==================' to the end of each page which separates column 1 from column 2. Simple as that.</div>

<div class="content">Tijl, could you possibly elaborate on your comment about using FocusPad for SuperFocus?  I tried your example, but can't get it working -- it's easy enough to turn on the "long list" option so that each list can hold up to 21 items, and you can add a dividing line by entering "----" or similar onto the list to separate the two columns as you suggested, but it looks to me that FocusPad won't let you start a new page until the current page is completely full.  Simply adding a divider won't let you create a new page when the current page is half-full (leaving room for the second column).<br><br>What have I done wrong?  It looks to me that you can add separate "pads" to represent the various pages, but then you can't flick between them.  I'd like to have separate half-full pages with two columns as you suggest.<br><br>Any pointers?  You obviously got it working, so I must be missing something obvious.  Thanks in advance...</div>

<div class="content">Sorry for the late reply.<br><br>I have my pad set as fixed length (25 items). Whenever I notice that a new page has been started I go back to the previous page and add a line ('=======') by tapping the '+' row at the bottom which basically draws the line between the left and right colums of that page. When I then want to add a task to the second column, I tap the '+' row again, which will add a task to the curren page *provided* that you have this option enabled in the application settings.<br><br>If tapping the '+' row adds a task to the last page instead of the current page, that option may be disabled or it may be a bug. It wasn't working for me at some point and then it suddenly started working again. I haven't been able to reproduce it.<br><br>If you have any further questions, let me know. I'm using the latest beta version by the way (beta 12).</div>
