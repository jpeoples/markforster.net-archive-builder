<div class="content">The technique was something like this:<br><br>1)  find the first item that meets the need. That becomes the baseline. <br>2)  look for the first item that is better than the baseline item. <br>3)  choose that item, and get on with your day knowing that you statistically made a good choice. <br><br>It had something to do with not endlessly comparing, contrasting, weighing options, and ultimately taking a lot of time while still being vaguely dissatisfied. <br><br>If I recall, there was actually some math or science behind why it was a solid decision process.<br><br>Can anyone point me in the right direction? :)</div>

<div class="content">Colley's Rule! That's the one I was looking for. And surprise surprise, a Google search comes up almost empty except for this exceptional forum. Thanks all!<br><br>I also appreciate the Secretary Problem as another method. And we are all about finding another method!</div>
