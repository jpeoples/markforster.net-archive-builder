<div class="content">I like the approach of AF a lot.   However, I am pretty much paperless - everything is on my work PC, my mac or my ipad.   Are there any apps that work well with the AF method?<br><br>Thanks</div>

<div class="content">Many apps work with it.  Omnifocus and Toodledoo are popular.</div>

<div class="content">I use paper for time management, but many here like EverNote. EverNote is my default app for all other types of notes. It doesn't work quite as well across all platforms as it claims, but it's pretty good.<br><br>There was a thread about using EverNote with one task per note and sorting by date last actioned.<br><br>There's another thread about using Clear.</div>

<div class="content">If you are on PC, you can also try MyLifeOrganized - for me it was best option (when I was on PC). Very flexible, able to incorporate almost any time management system.</div>

<div class="content">Focuspad (tony Mann) and FocusTodo (syncretic works). Both for iOS and built specifically for af.</div>

<div class="content">Question:  Are there ChromeBook or Open Source software suitable for AutoFocus?<br><br>Hello Folks:  I am new to the world of AutoFocus.  While I am anticipating using a handwritten notebook, as I explore utilizing the system, I want to experiment w/ electronic approaches.  I saw another thread discussing various apps.  I am days away from receiving my new ChromeBook.  Any ChromeBook or Open Source software suitable?<br><br>TIA !</div>

<div class="content">This is FV, rather than AF, but Blanclist works very well if you want an electronic implementation.<br><br>https://www.blanclist.com/app/<br><br>I have returned to paper and find the sense of finishing pages important to me, but Blanclist works really nicely on a Chromebook (and any browser).</div>

<div class="content">ToDoList by Dan Godsen (<a href="http://www.abstractspoon.com/tdl_resources.html)," target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.abstractspoon.com/tdl_resources.html),</a> free, Windows only is fabulous and extremely adaptable to nearly all of Mark's (and other's) systems.</div>

<div class="content">Maureen,<br><br>Thanks for the link. <br><br>How do you use it for complex projects?<br><br>Do you put each project in a separate Tasklist (a separate tab) or do you have one big hierarchical list with all your projects on one tab?<br><br>I like this better than Asana. It is much more like the desktop application that I have used for years. The only advantage of Asana is that it is completely web-based. To get around this, I am saving the ToDoList file in Dropbox, so I can access it at home and at work. In addition, there is a free TDL Android app, so I can use it on my phone. The synching still is not as seamless as a web-based app, but I think it could work. Thanks again.</div>
