<div class="content">I've come up with a tool to use on projects it's especially useful for larger projects or ones that you're resisting. It's a combination of the dynamic list concept and no-list FVP, it's related to the halving method from Get Everything Done. Given a project with a goal you know at least in outline, start off the list with asking yourself:<br><br>"What would me in the right direction?"<br><br>With this as your root task, engage in repeated questioning and write down a list with:<br><br>"What would move me towards X?"<br><br>Repeating until it's doable, then repeat the question each time you complete a task, ala No-List FVP. As this is a dynamic list, you can edit it at any time, eliminating things that are no longer relevant, switch to different ways of processing it, etc.<br><br>As usual for dynamic lists, rewrite it each day. You can also do this off of a specific action that needs to be salami sliced, if you're using it with a more traditional dynamic list, you probably want to mark these tasks differently, with a dot or circle.</div>
