<div class="content">Hello again :-)<br><br>(I'm reposting here as the previous thread got side-tracked with a Windows 7 security bug which I'm confident now has been fixed. I've now thoroughly checked out the program and it's working well!)<br><br>If you find yourself getting distracted by certain time wasting websites or programs when you really should be focusing on your Important Projects or your AF or SF list, then please try my program 'Distraction Blocker' which can block virtually anything you want on your computer for a specified time (Windows OS Only).<br><br><a href="http://www.distractionblocker.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.distractionblocker.com</a><br><br>If you've tried the program, please post here with your comments.<br>If you have any questions or problems please email me at: support at distraction blocker dot com<br><br>Many thanks!<br><br>Jon @ Distraction Blocker<br>(posted with Mark's permission)</div>
