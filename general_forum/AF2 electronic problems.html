<div class="content">I curiously started testing AF2, since I was not totally happy with AF1.<br>I have made one change, since I prefer electronic notes taking instead of physical: I re-sorted my list, so the newest additions are at the top, and I work my list from top-to-bottom. (I didn't appreciate going from bottom-up - working my way down from the top feels a lot better.)<br><br><br>However, I'm stuck with making the dismissal of old items work smoothly.<br>I have to list also my done items, in order to find what items should be 'on notice' for dismissal (from the bottom up to the latest acted-on). I mark these with a yellow flag (I am still working with MLO / Mylife Organized).<br><br>When I the following day decide to really dismiss these marked items I don't know how to do this efficiently.<br>I can mark them 'dismissed', and make them disappear from my current list.<br>But imo, I also should remove the very last 'acted-on' items, so I can detect what items should be on-notice the next day. These last one of few lines have no use any more, and the list must not grow forever, I guess?<br><br>(There is no easy way to add a separator exactly where I want it, since I'm sorting on (already past) creation dates.)<br><br>Any one have any ideas on doing this in the electronic AF2 system?<br><br>(I hope you can disregard my sorting principle of the newest at the top instead of AF2's way at the bottom - the problem of dismissal is the same nayway.)</div>

<div class="content">Jabbe I use this exact approach in Listomni for the iPhone. I regularly delete completed (not dismissed) tasks to keep my list shorter, leaving only the completed tasks I need to denote uncompleted blocks of tasks. So if I have<br><br>uncompleted a<br>uncompleted b<br>completed c<br>completed d<br>dismissed e<br>dismissed f<br>completed g<br><br>I delete completed c, d and g. Make sense</div>

<div class="content">@Mel: Thanks for your confirmation! <br>Do you keep track of your completed and dismissed items in any way?<br>Or do you just delete them?</div>

<div class="content">Jabbe, I used to. That was when I still felt like my task management wasn't in control. Now I feel like things are moving along well and I don't really care about my numbers. I can see a situation where you want to remember if you did something or not (called so and so, sent a sympathy card, etc.). In that case, you could certainly leave it in place OR move them to a new list. Listomni allows me to view only uncompleted tasks or to mark items and move them in a group to a new Completed List if I so desired. I have just taken to deleting most of the completeds so my list stays short and manageable. But now that I think about it, it might be fun to watch that Completed List grow and would be nice to view it if I can't remember if I've finished something or not. Thanks for the question!</div>
