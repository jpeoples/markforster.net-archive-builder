<div class="content">Anybody use check lists for regular tasks?  Like for clean kitchen you might have:<br><br>- wash dishes<br>-dry<br>- clean counter<br>-sweep<br>-mop<br>- toss mouldy food<br>- put out trash<br><br>another list could be for morning routines<br>- get up<br>- smile (grimace)<br>- shower<br>- dress (details?)<br>- rotate pictures<br>- teapot<br>- shave<br>- cereal<br>- put milk away<br>-grab computer<br><br>or maybe a much shorter checklist including only those things you may forget. The point of course is to eliminate worry and forgetfulness as a factor, and to use a list as a template to make better routines.  Also having orderly routines, written or not, simplifies living.</div>

<div class="content">I'm a big fan of routines.  I think they are essential to sanity ;-)<br><br>Generally, my routines are those which I don't do often enough so that I might forget, or those where the cost of forgetting is high.  So I don't have much in the way of housecleaning routines any longer.  I do have packing lists, though, because I will forget things if I have not noted them down.<br><br>Oddly I have a list of salad fixings because I so often have forgotten to put in the X that I just bought because it sounded so tasty when I was in the store.   I tend to record recipes because I forget how I did it when it worked out so well.  I also clip the preparation instructions from boxes before I trash them.  Some stuff lives in the freezer so long that when it comes out I can't think what to do with it!<br><br>When I was younger ... MUCH younger ... I had a routine whereby I put certain things in certain pockets then all I needed to do was recite an incantation (list of items) and slap each pocket in turn to assure myself that I had it.  I never forgot stuff and it reduced the fuss factor to nearly zero.<br><br>Another thing you might consider is "lessons learned".  It is an idea I picked up working with the military.  After every mission or project they produce a "lessons learned" report wherein they describe what worked and what did not so the next time someone has to do it they can avoid the same mistakes.  So after a trip, when unpacking I note what I took that I did not use and what I forgot that I needed.  Next trip, I can be guided by that.</div>

<div class="content">Hi all<br>Hell, I'd probably be living on a sidewalk if I didn't have my engrained habits, checklists for when I need them and my trusty calendar coupled with my daily MIT's pulled from my weekly aims list. Another bonus of engrained habits.....there's little if any resistance!  All that got worked out when we were young!  Even with occasional resistance, the mere starting usually gets me goose stepping to what I've been doing for decades!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">I'm currently reading The Checklist Manifesto, fascinating examples from aviation, medicine and construction, so far.<br><br>But I've used checklists (a form of routine) for years, goes back to being 8,000 feet up in the mountains, stopping for a tea break and asking someone to pass the sugar - no-one had brought any.<br><br>I'm almost neurotic about these lists, but mostly they work.  Some colleagues tease me about having gadgets, spares etc (I carry TWO power adapters for my Toshiba notebook, if one goes, I'm ok, because replacements are not readily available in places like Kabul, Matagalpa, Choma, Morogoro, Peja etc, all in developing/transition regions).<br><br>BUT when they need a Leatherman, Swiss Army knife, spare batteries etc, guess who they come to?  And guess who gets beers?<br><br>So, Alan, I think checklists are essential, even for routines.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Alan,<br><br>When the sugar wasn;t there , I was 21 and laptops etc al hadn't been invented!<br><br>But hauling through airports these days is a bit of a pain.  Last night I arrived here in Damascus, Syria, the the start of a year-long assignment.  At baggage reclaim I had no local currency to get a luggage trolley, so i had to pull 1 x 30 kg (books and other stuff) and 1 x 20 kg (clothes etc) rolling hard shell cases through to the taxi driver while balancing my cabin bags on top of each!  <br><br>To make things more awkward, I now have an additional computer, so have to extract two for security.  I bought the netbook  (Toshiba NB305) as a backup if something happens to my main laptop, (I'm using Dropbox to keep them in sync), but the real reason is that a netbook can be used more easily on the meal tray in cattle class (coach?).<br><br>@sabre23t: yes, I also loved that story, different, but effective!</div>

<div class="content">Checklists: Yeah, but no.<br><br>I've been discussing this (elsewhere) and have been trying to put into words why some of what is being called a "checklist" is not.<br><br>The example in that article of the building was not a checklist ... it was a PERT/CPM plan.  Neither is it a To Do list.  As I often carp .. words have a meaning.  A PERT/CPM plan includes dependency and time, not simply tasks ... not even tasks and priority.  It is a very different animal from a checklist.  You can't simply check off "turn over keys to new owner" at the start of the project ... it is one of the LAST things you check off!<br><br>A pilot's checklist IS a checklist.  It is a list of things to be done that he CHECKS  off, in order, before being satisfied that a particular task is done.  A recipe is also a checklist.  A grocery list is a sort of checklist, but it is not ordered so we don't commonly think of it as a checklist.  Also, a grocery list does not pertain to a single thing ... you may be shopping for dairy and meat and veggies.  It may be for lunches or dinners.  It may include things for a party.  It may include different stores.  It is not a single "project", IOW.  (And no, it is not a single project just because you are going to buy all those things. ;-)<br><br>The story about the rock band is interesting, and clever, but it is NOT a checklist that is being referred to but a CONTRACT.  Now I would argue that there are probably places in that contract that would CALL FOR a checklist, but the checklist is not the contract any more than the M&Ms are.<br><br>A To Do list is not a checklist ... it is a To Do list.  I guess we could debate the exact definition of a checklist until the cows come home but clearly a To Do list is a different animal.  It is a list, to be sure.  But it might be prioritized or time blocked or scheduled and one thing it lacks is continuity.  One does not use the same To Do list every day.  Checklists are reusable.  One does not use a To Do list for items that are not part of a larger thing ... a checklist is used precisely for that.  A To Do list is a bunch of things related ONLY by the fact that you intend to do them.  A checklist is a bunch of things you MUST do to get a certain well defined outcome (like land a plane on its wheels without crashing it and getting people angry with you) and the items on it are almost always permanent and done in a sequence.  I.E. you always do the same things in the same order in the same way to land a plane safely.<br><br>That is the real power of a checklist and why it is used.  You work out the bugs in a procedure and then by following the steps exactly each time ... you get the same result -- the result you want.</div>

I guess I do use it interchangeably with ToDoList, but then, as I think Alan infers above, why write down these tasks unless you want to "check" them off as done, or even via DWM, to  dismiss them.  I think a DWM list or AF list is closer to a checklist than, say, the list of British MPs who have unblemished records of integrity, or the Top Ten of Anything.<br><br>I do enjoy the varying contributions of the regulars in this forum, as well as the new ones which make us look at things again now and then.</div>

<div class="content">>>>   "words have a meaning". The lady in red knows sometimes words have two meanings. <<<<br><br>Not holding the context constant.  If you change the meaning of a word as used in a context you are guilty of the logical fallacy of equivocation if you are arguing a point and fuzzy thinking otherwise.<br><br>>>>  I agree with that a checklist is a bunch of things you MUST do to get a certain well defined outcome. I disagree that anything else is required to define a checklist. The operation of a checklist is to do something and then mark it done. <<<<br><br>No, and that is my point.  It is not just to do "something", it is to accomplish a GOAL.  That part is essential.  That is why we have two different words (Checklist and To Do list) ... because they are different ideas so we need different words.  If they were the same thing we'd only need the one word.<br><br>>>>  I claim each of the above examples is a checklist.  In the case of a grocery list, that outcome is keeping your wife happy that you bought everything she needs. <<<<br><br>That is exactly what I said was NOT the kind of thing that operates as a goal.  You can pick any old thing and find some way to attach it to some concept and say that they are related.  But the question is are they REALLY related.  The point of doing the SHOPPING might be to keep your wife happy.  But that is not the goal of the LIST!  See, that is why I say one needs to impose a level of precision if one is to understand these concepts.  Well, that or just keep rambling on batting words and concepts around willy-nillly.<br><br>I mean, the question that started this was about routines, and checklists ... not To Do lists and grocery lists.  Obviously, to me at least, you were wondering about a checklist rather than a To Do list.  If that's not the case, O.K.  I'll go away.<br><br>>>>  In the case of PERT/CPM, the list is ordered by a plan, <br><br>No, it IS the plan, and it is ordered by dependency and shows timing.<br><br>>>>  but surely every single item will be checked off when done.<br><br>You can check anything off any kind of list but that does not make it a checklist.  I'm saying that just because you write a list of things and check them off you do not have a "checklist".<br><br>>>>   (Failing that, an entire branch of the plan might be forgotten.) I'll grant that a TODO list which contains optional items isn't a checklist. But that Van Halen contract, its line items should have been treated as a checklist by the venue. The places that failed his test were those that neglected the power of this concept.  <<<<br><br>I'm not dinging the idea ... I think it is inspired.  My point is that a contract is not a checklist.  It can, and should, GENERATE a checklist but it is not organized that way.  The people who are responsible for wiring are not even going to look the contract ... and that was the real problem.  Had it generated a real checklist, nothing would have been overlooked.<br><br>But look, the only reasons I jumped into this was to help with the question and to clarify my own thinking.  I've achieved the second thing, mostly, and if I'm not helping I'll let it lie here.</div>

<div class="content">Roger,<br><br>>>>  Yes, I think there are some differences, however, I still use "checklist" in a number of contexts. <<<<br><br>Yes, I understand that.  Most of my difficulty with understanding any idea stems from fuzzy use of various concepts.  I find that when I clarify my usage of the terminology many of my problems vanish.  My post here was an effort to clarify how I use some of these terms.<br><br>>>>  I guess I do use it interchangeably with ToDoList, but then, as I think Alan infers above, why write down these tasks unless you want to "check" them off as done, or even via DWM, to dismiss them.

It is a list.  You can check things off, but it is not a checklist because it lacks persistence and is not organized around a specific outcome.  And don't' give me what Alan did about outcome ;-) ... you can grab anything and CALL it an outcome, but it is an outcome only if it IS an outcome.  Again, that is a specific concept.  My AF list is just a pile of things with no specific outcome.  You can call "living a good life" an outcome, but that is too broad to be meaningful.  My list has a number of outcomes.  Many financial ones, many health ones, many other specific outcomes.  So my AF list is a list with many various outcomes embodied by various subsets of the items on it.<br><br>Also, the AF list is not ordered.  Checklists are almost always ordered lists.  I'm not 100% sure if all checklists MUST be ordered, but I do know that everything I all a checklist IS.  I'll have to give that point more thought.</div>

<div class="content">Mike, I agree that AF is not a checklist, but it is a to-do list.  There might be artificial barriers put around work, timing of projects, whatever, but in essence it's a long, running to-do list of disconnected items.</div>

<div class="content">Alan, I was just kidding around.  I'm just saying that too much routine isn't good for those who take it too far.  Things like always going to the same restaurants, pot roast every Sunday, hanging out with the same friends at the same bar every Friday after work, watching X show on TV every Wednesday night - stuff like that.  I know lots of people like that.<br><br>I'm finding the timed bursts routine that I've been doing the last few days is enough of a routine without being onerous and pretty much touches everything that I want to make a habit of right now without putting too much emphasis on the little things.  It's a good daily routine but the sky won't fall in if I missed a couple of days because life got suddenly interesting.</div>

<div class="content">I'm not in danger of that folly of taking routine too far. I'm the sort who will drive south from work just because I usually drive north or west. I'm talking about keeping lists so I don't forget to put the milk away having been distracted by the birds chirping ousideand so my lunch actually comes with me to work.  :-) the point is to STOP thinking about routine stuff and get it out of my AF list. So far I think this is eminently the right direction.</div>

<div class="content">I used to find morning and evening checklists helpful, certainly. They would not go on my todo lists.<br><br>And I can see the point of a checklist for shopping, along the lines of the Listpro shopping list (a list of everything you routinely buy, and what shop you get it from: first you check off what you've got in the house, then you add any specials and shop for the rest).</div>

<div class="content">What fascinates me about routines is that most people I know who are pretty organised and seem to enjoy a full life with a lot less stress than me live by their routines.  These can be a structure for their week, or daily/weekly/monthly lists. It invariably covers both work and home.<br><br>I have been using the website memo-to-me to help me do this.  I started with household things that I just forget - like changing the towels in the bathroom and watering the plants. My plan is to try various routines, then when I am happy with them I can perhaps laminate the daily/weekly ones to remind me.  I reckon the monthly tasks are better entered into my diary as a recurring event.<br><br>I also think the trick is to recognise when the routine is no longer working and adjust or change it to something that works better if circumstances change.</div>

<div class="content">I have found it very useful to put structure around my day something like this (in the spirit of absolutely clear terminology, "X:XX" below means a particular time every day, such that the X:XX on one line occurs earlier than the X:XX of the subsequent line; and "checklist" usually refers to a list of required tasks that are best followed in sequence, which was originally written down but eventually took the form of an unwritten habit):<br><br>X:XX AM:  Get up (follow the "get up" checklist)<br><br>X:XX AM:  Outside (follow the "outside" checklist, such as (1) Turn on drip system, (2) Feed dogs, (3) Open chicken coop, (4) Walk and pray, (5) Turn off drip system)<br><br>X:XX AM:  Work  (required meetings/appts and/or DWM)<br><br>X:XX PM:  Errands and/or meetings and/or home/family  (pre-scheduled activities consisting of required meetings/appts and/or DWM and/or being available for whatever family needs present themselves)<br><br>X:XX PM:  Put children to bed (follow the "bedtime" checklist, which may not qualify as a strict checklist, since some of the tasks are optional or can be done out of order)<br><br>X:XX PM:  Evening routine (follow the "evening" checklist for wrapping up and winding down and getting ready to retire for evening)<br><br><br>In all these cases, the use of the checklist helps make the tasks in question automatic, requiring no thought or decisions, which is what makes them so useful.  They improve efficiency and efficacy and consistency, and provide a framework that works like an old shoe -- it just does its job without being noticed, to allow you to focus your energy and attention on the things that really need them.</div>

<div class="content">I always get a bit disoriented when we can't follow these routine checklists for some reason, and always feel much more at ease as soon as I corral myself and my distracted thoughts and the children and animals and activities of the day into this predictable framework.  When things are going in all directions at once, which happens a lot in our household, falling back to the routine of our checklists just helps get back on an even keel.<br><br>Part of this is probably my own personality, which craves orderliness and feels unbalanced without it.</div>

<div class="content">Ever read Alvin Toffler's "Future Shock" and subsequent books?   In anticipating increasing levels of change and disruption, Toffler advocated allowing and encouraging change and disruption in every area of our lives, including our marriages and morals and values.  I think he was mistaken there -- having a solid foundation in our family life, or at least in our core values and goals, allows us to be secure enough to rise up to the challenge of dealing with the change and disruption happening in every other area of modern life.   Checklists are a tool that can help in this.  At least that's my experience.</div>
