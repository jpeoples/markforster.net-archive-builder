<div class="content">Hello forum folk, <br><br>I really liked Andreas' magnificent demonstration of AF4 and I would love to see something similar for DVM. Failing that, would some kind person like to explain how their system is working? <br><br>Thanks  :-)</div>

<div class="content">I do not have Andreas' talent with flow charts/animations, but here's what my DWM system looks like.<br><br>The setup:<br>I have a regular 5"x7" lined notebook.  I use one sheet (front and back) for each date.  This means that I can rip pages out as all the tasks on them are completed and gives me enough room for everything.  If need be, I can resort to writing two columns on each page.<br>The first page in the book is today's (I call it Page D).  Tasks on this page that I don't get to today will be eliminated from the list automatically.<br>I have two bookmarks (really colored paperclips): one for today + 7 (30 March - I call it Page W) and one for today + 1 month (23 April - I call it Page M).  There has been a LOT of debate about the definition of "month" - some people use 30 days, some people use 28.  I have chosen to go with calendar month, which I think is what Mark was doing as well.  These are the points of entry for all tasks, the open lists for the day: new tasks go on page M; re-entered tasks go on page W.  All pages between page D and page W are permanently closed lists and will never be added to again.<br><br>The process:<br>As I was composing this post I thought of a handful of new tasks, so I opened my book to page M and jotted down<br>- wash neb parts<br>- pack up paula (my daughter's nebulizer)<br>- unload dishwasher<br>Yes, these are tasks that I need to get to before 1:40 this afternoon but they are NEW so they go on page M.<br><br>Now let's pretend I've started working on my DWM list.  <br>- I open my book to where I left off last night, which is indicated by a paperclip on the side of the notebook (the bookmark ones are on the top).  <br>- I read through the list and when a tasks stands out as "ready to be done" I will do it.  <br>- I decide that the "guest room" task is ready to be done, so I go and pull the sheets off of the guest bed and put them into the laundry in preparation for houseguests this weekend.  I then re-enter it on page W because it's not completed yet.<br>- As I'm doing this, I remember that I need to talk to my parents about when they're coming to visit us this summer, so I add that task on page M.<br>- I continue reading through my list starting from the original "guest room" entry, waiting for another task to stand out.<br>- I make it to page M without any tasks standing out and so I flip back to the beginning of the list (page D).  These are the tasks that are going over the edge if I don't work on them today.  I work on transcribing an interview but don't complete it.  It is saved!  Or re-entered on page W, at least.<br>- I continue reading through my list starting from the original "transcribe interview" entry that I worked on.  The next task that stands out is "750 words" and it's the last one on a page that falls between page D and page W - a closed list than can never be added to again. I work on it, re-enter it on page W, and RIP OUT THE PAGE!  (This is where my implementation may differ from others'; I don't keep completed pages around.)<br><br>And I work round and round like that all day.  New tasks go on page M, re-entered tasks go on page W.  For today, all other lists are closed.  Pages between D and W that get completed can be removed.<br><br>At the end of the day, I rip out today's page whether all the tasks are completed or not and advance my bookmarks by one day.  Depending on what the following day looks like, sometimes I use Mark's current initiative modification (see here: <a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2010/2/10/a-couple-of-options-for-dwm.html)" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2010/2/10/a-couple-of-options-for-dwm.html)</a> or I sometimes don't.  Working in this way I usually get 2-3 days ahead during the week which is good because my list gets very little attention during weekends.<br><br>I hope this makes sense & is helpful to you!</div>

<div class="content">Sarah,<br><br>That's a really good description of a manual DWM system, a good reminder for those of us using electronic versions (I use ListPro) to make sure we are are straying too far like lost sheep.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Roger... the funny part is that as I was writing it, I found myself wondering if I have actually come up with some crazy bastardized version of DWM because I haven't gone back to reread the original description in so long!</div>

<div class="content">Oops!  I've got too many ares', if you'll forgive the expression, should read, "are NOT"<br><br>You're not Australian or some other 'colonial' are you,Sarah?  Not many would use the word 'bastardis/zed', but I reckon you're a bit like me (Saffer) ie tell it like it is or at least what you perceive it to be.<br><br>In all seriousness, even if one person has followed Mark's DWM gospel slavishly, that person will still have tweaked it somehow.  As Will and others have emphasised, what ever you end up with, it's got to work for YOU!</div>

<div class="content">Sarah,<br><br>Re=reading your description with a glass or three of Aussie red wine, I asked myself, "What is it about this description that makes it so good and insightful?"<br><br>The answer, I think, is that you use  realistic EXAMPLES of the tasks and processes, and these help put it into everyday context.<br><br>Example: "I continue reading . . . . "<br><br>Work for me.<br><br>Roger J</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for this Sarah - I really enjoyed reading it also. For some reason the description seemed to remove me from the date/diary element that has always bugged me slightly - you managed to imply the list nature of the system rather than the date. It also made it seem very simple and doable.<br><br>The only modification I would probably make is to use something like my filofax for this process - each page is then separate and removing it it easy and not at all messy.</div>

<div class="content">Roger, nope, I'm about as American as they come (one of my ancestors was a scapegoat for the ORIGINAL tea party).  I do think better in terms of concrete examples, though, which is why I explained it that way.<br><br>Alison, the date thing hung me up for a while, too.  I think that's why I started thinking of the relevant pages by their DWM initials rather than as dates and at this point it doesn't phase me anymore.  My cheapo notebook makes page removal very easy too, and it's sooooo satisfying.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the sample workflow!  It's reassuring to see someone doing the same.<br><br>I'm using a bunch of printed 5.5x8.5 templates for my pages.  I started with regular 8.5x11 letter paper but learned that my daily AF wasn't all that long, so 1/2 sheet is enough.  I don't like the idea of tearing out pages, and I have scrap galore to print on the backs.<br><br>I also got distracted by the date thing, but after committed myself and printed out a full 4-week set,  I don't look at the dates anymore.  I have a post-it to flip to the active W day, and flip to the last page M (28) for new tasks.   Just one page for today's AF cycle, and one page for new tasks.  I'm a DWM convert and it really drives home the concept of open and closed lists.<br><br>My main tweak is just a line to separate the new items entered a month ago from the daily AF.  I can easily see what I need to do and also what i'm doing.</div>

<div class="content">Hello Sarah, thank you very much for that clear example of how to use DWM without the calendar dates getting in the way. I was fine with DWM until I had to take nearly three weeks out of the system, when I came back everything was out of kilter. It was easier for me to lump all the tasks all together à la AF way rather than try to move them around to suit the actual date.<br><br>I'll start your version of DWM over the coming week  :-)</div>
