<div class="content">Dear All,<br><br>I am Mario from Italy. I have recently started to use SF and I an new to this forum. <br>I have read DIT a couple of years ago and I found it incredibly useful.<br>I have now a long list of activities to be done. Most ot them are long task, ie. task that cannot be accomplished in one day. I also have frequent interruptions and changes of priorities. Which level of granularity do you use? I.e. "write report of the visit to the client" (this would need some days and make me move slowly) or "write 1st chapter of the report of the visit to the client" (this would make me move faster through the list but will make me loose the idea of "project")?<br><br>I apologize if this has already been discussed....I looked at several posts but they were not of help.<br><br>Thank you<br>Mario</div>

<div class="content">Marioc,<br><br>Welcome,  I think it varies by person and system.  There are some who don't mind having things on their lists like build dream house and others, like myself would write call architect to inquire about qualifications.  Personally I write tasks that can be finished in less than one day.  I like the momentum it gives me.  I also use Triple Task and for me it flows much better sticking to this rule.  Alternatively, you can use a project list along with a task management system to make sure you do not loose site of the totality of your commitments.  Good luck.  If you are interested in how I do TT, you can visit my blog for a few articles I wrote on it, Mark also has his TT method under systems review on this site.<br><br>Gerry<br><br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div>

<div class="content">I find every task is different. If i work on it, no problem. If it's important but I'm not sure what to do, it's too big, and I should figure a smaller part. If I'm lost for too many little things and can't figure out priority and order, I'm better off grouping them into a project and managing them as a group.</div>

<div class="content">Mario,<br><br>Just as with DIT, one of the core principles of SF is little and often. What I have found is that my item descriptions are very coarse-grained. The whole point of the AFs and SFs is that they prevent me from moving on until I do something on each closed list. So, I do something. Sometimes it's truly very little, and other times, it's hours and hours. <br><br>If I am worried that I won't know what to do, I will make some note about what the next step is. But, I also keep separate project plans for long-running projects, because I have learned that if I don't track these projects, I quickly forget what I have done and what I wanted to do next. For projects with written plans, I merely write the project name in SF, and then I go to my project plan to figure out what the next action is.<br><br>In your example, there are many possibilities. My initial entry might be "Client X." When that task stood out, I would think about what I need to do. If I feel a lot of confusion or resistance towards the project, I might decide that I need to make some notes on what needs to be done for this project. So, I create a project plan.<br><br>A project plan, for me, does not need to be complete. It might just be one or two tasks that I realize I need to do somewhere along the line, in order to move on the project. I have found, though, that the process of thinking of a few actions and writing them down, however incomplete, help wear down my resistance, so that the next time I see "Client X" on my list I feel ready to do something.</div>

<div class="content">marioc,<br><br>These are all good suggestions. If you are new to AF/SF, I would just add one thing:<br><br>Make sure the tasks/projects you write down are compelling enough to "stand out." This "standing out" is the heart of AF and SF. If you write the name of a big project that you cannot visualize, it is unlikely to stand out. You would need to break it down into pieces that you can imagine really getting started on.<br><br>However, we are all different, and a project that might be too hard for *me* to visualize might be in fact very easy for you to visualize. Then, I would need to break it down into steps, but you could write it as a single item.<br><br>You will have to discover how much detail you need in your lists to make these items "stand out" and get done.</div>
