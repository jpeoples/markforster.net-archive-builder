ABC 123 method, to Filofax - with history ending around publication of 1990.<br><br>of course longer summaries & reviews than mine on amazon<br><br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tao-Time-Diana-Hunt/dp/0805009426" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Tao-Time-Diana-Hunt/dp/0805009426</a></div>

<div class="content">Funny - I'm currently reading this (I forget who or where recommended it), and it's a refreshing break from the rules and tools (productivity) talk. And yes, it does carry a similar spirit to Mark's Dreams.</div>

<div class="content">In Chapter 2, Dr. Hunt does a find job at describing why productivity systems rarely work for most people. Over a decade of mucking around with these things, I'm in agreement. I'm curious to see what Hunt (and Hait) come up with as a solution. <br><br>A couple of quotes (the second really hit home):<br><br>"Instead of condemning the (productivity) system, we need to look to ourselves. This isn't easy, because time management programs rarely invite time for introspection."<br><br>"So even when we stay on schedule, we feel uneasy. After we've checked off the items that we need to do, we still don't feel a sense of accomplishment or well-being."</div>

<div class="content">@avrum, wow, this is fun. when I first posted this 2 years ago there were no comments. Nice to find conversation spanning time.<br><br>Wonder if there is a setting as with some blog/comment systems where we may get notified when a followup comment is posted. I sometimes only go in here once a week, so almost missed this.<br><br>Glad you are enjoying, please do post as you continue to read more chapters.</div>

<div class="content">MatthewS- <br><br>I've had email contact with both Pam and Diana. Here's a response from Diana regarding the relevancy of the material in 2013: <br><br>"Honestly, I have been thinking it is more relevant today than when published in 1990. But, of course, the Taoist philosophy is timeless."<br><br>I've begun the visualization for Week 1 this morning. Because there's no audio versions of the visualizations, I recorded (and listened to) the instructions with my iphone. <br><br>Did you do the exercises?</div>
