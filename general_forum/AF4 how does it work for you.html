<div class="content">Dear all, <br><br>I went back to AF4 about 6 month ago. I mean really. Using AF4 with the right rules. <br><br>I admit it works perfectly for me. I dont have to add many tips except may be parenthesis for project, adding dates, adding Wait in front of things I am waiting for, adding date at the beginning of each day. <br><br>For most of my project i d'ont need to plan them very much I just add in my AF4 the bigs rock. I am very happy with the treatment of interruptions. AF4 deals with it very welll. <br><br>Sometime I think about the methods and it seems for me so illogical, so incredible that i still can't believe it works. But it does ! <br><br>It's really a revolution for me. After GTD all things are so simple and so fast to do. And I advance in my work what ever happen. <br><br>Dismissing rules works perfectly. When i am stuck on something I just high-line it and treat it later or another day. <br><br>I still sont understand why it is so addictive with me. Why I am so efficient. Why I do the right things at the right time. <br><br>Since i work with AF4 my day are under control<br><br>The stress I have is because of the business and i trust the system. <br>I never really trusted GTD<br>I am focus on the most important things<br>I never forget anything.<br>I do a daly review at night when I mostly treat the high-lined tasks. <br><br>I dont need any other list (i main daily list) <br>I like having a project list but it's for fun. <br><br>Sorry about my enthusiasm. you may believe i am fool. <br><br>Am I alone ? <br>What's about you ? <br>How do you fell about the system  ?<br>What happened to you ?</div>

<div class="content">@Gerry . <br><br>Well at the beginning of AF4  I used 2 lists. <br>1. a project list about my active projects (a GTD habit)<br>2. A simple sheet of paper with only the bigs rocks of the day (not the details) to help me to focus. I had some difficulties to focus on task for the list which was huge. <br>Now I don't need any of them. The AF4 list is small to (never more than 4 pages) <br>And  The project list is included in AF4 for ex. Work on project XXX + the bigs rocks are reported each night at the end of my active list to be sure to focus on things he next day with sometime a date in parenthesis when there is a reported task.</div>

<div class="content">Jupiter, <br><br>Without a project list, do not you be afraid of some important project get lost?  How AF4 take care of this problem? The project list is one of the most important rule of GTD and if i will have to have one (using AF4), i will still have to do the review and populate list with the next actions. GTD again?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jupiter,<br><br>Thanks for starting this thread, getting some of us back to some basics!<br><br>I too have restarted using AF4 and I am going to report back later after a few weeks or months.<br><br>Still I get torn between digital and paper, but paper is still the leader for me, that personal interaction quality I think!  I'm envious of all the applications available to iPhone/iPad devotees, but I invested in a Windows Mobile device again last year, I'll evaluate again later - I think Windows Phone 7 could be a surprise to many folk.<br><br>FWIW, I have a Work AF4 list and a Personal AF4 list contained in the same notebook for lists.  I decided to have separate lists so I could focus on each in turn during specific periods in the day.  For those 'grey' tasks which don't seem to slot precisely into Work or Personal, - eg an online developmental course initiated and paid for by moi, but for the benefit of myself and future clients - I just decide which list to stick it on and live with it, or swop it over.  They are MY lists after all!<br><br>While I have set up project books with lists of tasks, I also have a daily pocketbook - Moleskine pocket notebook - which constitutes my Closed List, again to keep some focus going.  This notebook contains 3 or 4 MITs each for Work and Personal, with any additional tasks not listed anywhere which are or have to be done, appear.  A la DIT?<br><br>I use the RH page, one per day, the LH page is for expenses, quick and dirty notes, new tasks if my main list book is not close by, even my daily Internet usage in MB because I have a monthly cap where I'm living and working.<br><br>More later, suffice to say that I have managed to set up my current AF4 using ADOCs stationery due to its flexibility.<br><br>Again, thanks for starting this thread and to the others for responding!</div>

<div class="content">Jupiter has combined his project list and AF4 task list.  All the projects are in AF4.  If you don't want a project to get lost, I guess you must simply make sure to work on it rather than dismiss it.  <br><br>As for next actions, you simply write with the project.<br><br>          Build deck - draw up blueprint.<br><br>And when you have your blueprint drawn, you rewrite the project on the end of list<br><br>          Build deck - get prices for materials<br><br>So this is not GTD.  It's working on one task at a time, and rewriting it as needed.<br><br>I do basically the same thing, but I have a binder and one page is "Build deck" and on that page is "draw blueprint" (eventually that blueprint will also be in the binder, or a "Build deck" folder ) and "get prices for materials".</div>

<div class="content">Hello, First thanks to participate at this thread. I happy it please you. I like going back to the basis sometime. So I just take a little time to answer and complete what I said. <br><br>@Marco : "Without a project list, do not you be afraid of some important project get lost? "<br>Not at all. But you'r right i thought so. But i realized that having a project list was complicated to follow and had to be modified very often. So I did like Alan said "All the projects are in AF4. If you don't want a project to get lost, I guess you must simply make sure to work on it rather than dismiss it" I reformulate the project such as DO this and that (Project X) and Now it's done do that (Project X) I could place the project first but I took the happy to look at a glance on the right part of my A4 spiral note book to find all about the project when I need to focus on. A little tip I often use when I have to do all about a project. <br><br>@Alan about "being torn about digital and paper" Do do I. But I realized paper was better for me. However I have a note on my iphone name AF4 were I put all tasks when I am outside of my office (my A4 note book stay except if I have to work on it outside) and i report this tasks on my A4 note book when I am at the office. It dont take long. I notice too that I like the feeling of paper and please please only my BIC pen in ONE COLOR per day. The only other color is my yellow high-liner. Anyway every-time I tried digital it was a wash out. AF4 is pleasant and efficient with paper.<br><br>About my daily notes I have a second dated note book a brown one were I note all details and things when i am at the phone or thinking or even in meeting. When I have finished to take notes i just report on my blue note book the relative tasks and do it on the flow. I also report the most important thing on a special digital page one by project or client because I need it for reporting. <br><br>@Erik. Yes indeed. AF1 and AF4 are very similar and deserve a lot of enthusiasm. For myself i realized I sometime come back to af1 but very soon when the crises is over I return to AF4. As I said theses incredible systems let me astonished and i love using it little by little. The most incredible thing is to see how projects advance and how i killed proscratrination. I simply love the system and believe it. Please don't ask why. I won't be able to answer. <br><br>Cheers<br><br>Cheers to all.</div>

<div class="content">Just to say that reading yours post I have modified 2 things about AF4. <br><br>1. Project : I put them in parenthesis at the beginning of the task it is much faster to read them<br>2. I have divided my list in two one personal, one professional because I do personal things at certain time ie after diner, on saturday or sunday<br><br>My professional list looks like this :<br><br>                     {Project Vanves} Call Mr smith for pricing<br>W <= Wait    {Project CERGY } Appointment  (Oct 01) < means I wait it on oct 01<br>W                  {Project XXX} Bank transfer oct 5<br>                      {project Paris} send the teaser to mr Smith <br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>                      {project CERGY} do I accept the appointment with client on (Tuesday oct 5th) ?<br>                       {project bank} take an appointment with mrs johnson and negotiate the loan.<br>                       {project bank} work on the appointment with the bank about the loan (1h00)<br><br>Hope that helps</div>

<div class="content">+AJPM+<br><br>To Jupiter and Alan: Thanks for both of your inputs on how you handle projects. I originally handle my projects using a variation of your scheme, Alan, but ever since reading about how Jupiter handles projects, I have been planning to try a hybrid of the two, wherein I plan to handle all projects like how Jupiter does it, but keeping track of the tasks of more complicated projects on separate sheets in my binder like Alan and I do, but using "Work Breakdown Structure" charts.  Info on Work Breakdown Structures:<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_breakdown_structure" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_breakdown_structure</a><br><br>I will post my results in a few weeks.<br><br>However, I also have another tweak to my AF that, this time, declutters AF4 by entering "maintenance tasks," as Erik Lorraine elegantly names them, into the list only when they are ready to be done for that moment.  The tweak is similar to how Alan and I are handling projects in AF4. The tweak effectively reduced my AF list from around 200 tasks to just 48 on my count now...which is why I am looking forward to <<adding>> the tasks of my project lists into my main AF list ^___^<br><br>I have been using this tweak for the past month, so I think it is stable enough to be posted, and will be done probably tomorrow.</div>

<div class="content">@Nuntym<br><br>I really find interesting how much your list cleared up by using the pull on maintenance principle. I hadn't used AF for long enough to see that part in action since I thought of it afterwards, when I discovered the Kanban. It's quite a drastic change and I can see how energizing it can be to see only things you can/want to move on.<br><br>It's quite a refreshing feeling to see some of my stuff can apply to other systems as well :) Thanks for your effort and time in trying to understand what I wanted to convey!</div>

<div class="content">Just to add a little TWEAK I use since 2 weeks and which works very well with me <br><br>Principle : I didn't want to separate my list by context like in the other topic : <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1253799" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1253799</a><br><br>I like having all my stuff one task per line because it helps me to rush on the flow doing various tasks,each one, one by one and focus even if they concern others projects. <br><br>But I realised I needed sometime to see all about a project or all about a context or all about a dead line. SO I DRAW 4 colums on my A4 spiral note book<br>here are the titles<br>Deadline + Project + Context +   Task<br>_______________________________<br>10/02 + (CASH) + W (means Work on) + See the web acount how much money i have left<br>          + (PARIS)+ Call                            + John cash for the buildings how much ? <br>10/01 + (COM)  + Waiting                      + Mrs smith call me back for advertizment's price<br>          + (CASH) + Call                            + Mr Fath when do i have to pay the taxes. <br>          + ($$$)     + @                              + Send email to Mr Goal about johny's building (2)<br>          + ($$$)     + W                               + Johny's building what yield ? Market view ? (1)<br><br>W= work on <br>Call = Call someone<br>Waiting = waiting from someone<br>@ = Send an email<br>(PROJECT) name of the project usualy owner/localisation<br>(1) Do this first<br>(2) Do this after the point one is done<br>these 2 points are optional<br><br>Hope hat's helps, this one helps me a lot...<br><br>Jupiter</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jupiter, <br><br>I tend to lose my way, or focus, with AF4. I believe my problem is that I cross the 'backlog' and 'active' line not sticking to the rules. So it seems to feel like one big open list, even though it's not.<br><br>At the moment I'm trying out a 3 pronged approach: <br><br>1. INBOX TO ZERO SESSION (I can get away with one session per day, but I know others may not have this luxury)<br><br>2. MOST IMPORTANT TASK (MIT) (One only per day, I can override AF rules to get to this one item)<br><br>3. AUTOFOCUS 1 (As I find it generally easier to stick to AF 1 rules with features 1 and 2 above)<br><br>I'm very much hoping that this combination will work for me as unfortunately I am a serial time management tweaker!</div>

<div class="content">Leon, by all means keep doing your 3 pronged approach so as long as it works for you. (or even longer: often if something doesn't work well enough you can solve the problem within th system by just applying your mind to it. ). <br><br>As for AF4 the rules completely allow you to shift open-closed-open-closed. However, it is extremely important for its functioning that you ALWAYS action something from the closed list.  Your closed list will shrink and eventually force you to act on something you were avoiding. This makes the two lists very distinct in character.  My impression from your comment is you didn't do this and that's why everything blended into one.</div>

<div class="content">Great ! AF4 is not an easy method and not perfect too. I still struggle with the system too. <br>But I try to do my best to follow the rules. Sometimes its is very hard to me too. I like treating my calls as a bach, I like treating my emails like a batch too. So I jumps doing all togethen and look at a glance to my project list which is often a euristic project list. (much faster to make it)<br><br>Sometime it is difficult for me too about doing things one after the others. I would prefer doing a project as a hole. Writing it on paper doesnt autorize me to select all about a project list. So again I jump. <br><br>however i still stick with the system. Why ? Just because it makes me doing things. <br>the rules of dissmiss and reporting stuff on my diary olige me to plan my work and do it. <br>When i used GTD i was often stuck. <br><br>But there is something I noticed with AF4 I never encountered anywhere. There is an auto cleaning of tasks. I mean little by little the system regulates by itself what is important and what is not. I like it very much. With GTD the montain was too high. With AF4 i see the end of the road. It is much better for me. Even if i feel often very desorganised.</div>

<div class="content">Hello All ;-) <br>Since 10/ 23 th when i began this thread I have explained why AF4 worked for me. <br><br>October 2th I tried to add context and project to AF4 list because I needed to follow sometime my projects and contexts. <br><br>Yesterday I tried to adapt it on numbers (=excel) and finaly on omnifocus. I had no many items (only one page so it was fast.<br><br>I just want to tell you theses experiences were a wash out. <br><br>So I reported all my AF one by one with no context and no project hoping it will be better. <br><br>I realised I could have a big view of my project using Heuristic schemes. and keepin on AF4 track of all to advance little by little. <br><br>Anyway all my tried since 3 years of a digital solution are not acceptable. <br><br>I will report my experiments later. <br><br>Cheers to all.</div>

<div class="content">+AJPM+<br><br>Jupiter,<br><br>Unfortunately all AF systems seem to resist insertion of contexts, from a year of experience with them, except for very broad contexts like "Home" and "work," in which you may have different lists for each. The best that people (including Mark, from what I've been reading in the past discussions in this forum) that can come up with are lists separate from the main AF list with hard triggers inserted into the AF list.<br><br>God bless on your experiments.</div>

<div class="content">Agree with Mark in principle, but contexts can help as long as one can restrict the number of contexts.<br><br>GTD, MLO etc turned me off with contexts just being one of the many features that caused system overhead, manual or digital.<br><br>Due to my peripatetic work/life-style, I use a limited number of contexts (which I put on separate lists usually, not as tags on the main list, the main list contains the triggers as noted in a previous post above).  I cannot be in two places in the short-term, let alone simultaneously.<br><br>So I use 'Travel'  as a context as sometimes an airport is the next place I can get a decent enough Internet connection to be able to file online eg my VAT return (like sales tax for you guys across the Pond).<br><br>If I had a long daily commute where someone else did the driving, eg on a train, I'd probably include that as a context.<br><br>My checklists include the next flight (tends to be 5 - 11 hours or more door-to-door) because if I forget something, it can be a real problem.<br><br>MY UK taxi driver ALWAYS asks all his clients for the airport, 'Got your passport?' but my travel checklist for carryon/cabin contains all the IT items, files etc, and a pair of underpants, because ' a fool and his underwear are soon parted.'<br><br>I might share my thoughts on specific checklists if anyone is interested.<br><br>Just my 2p worth.</div>

<div class="content">Just to complete what hapened still I stopped context. <br>1. The system is much better I do all what I whish<br>2. The list has considerable increased in almot 3 days from 2 pages to 10<br>3. There are a lot of double beam<br>4. It is very difficult sometime to have a big view  about the project's big rocks. So I tried heuristic sheme and a secont list with some extraction of my master list (other tread) <br>Let's see what happen ....</div>
