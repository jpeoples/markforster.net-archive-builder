<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-03-8 1:08</div>
<div class="content">https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=12971209&postID=8985160562918949682&page=1<br><br>Autofocus got a favourable review on CEO blog, to which someone posted a negative comment but had some valid concerns - which is possible if you *NEVER* tried it.  And some people are such anal retentive schedulers that they probably only go to the bathroom if it's 2 p.m. on Tuesday.<br><br>Anyway here's the review - can someone besides me respond?  My response wasn't well thought out and too reactionary I think.  Here it is:<br><br>Regarding Mark Forster's web-site and his "Autofocus" system:<br><br>I'm not surprised that you were skeptical about it. Unlike you, however, I'm not inclined to give it a try. (Maybe I'm getting too old and set in my ways?)<br><br>Here are but a few of my "objections" and/or concerns:<br><br>1. By randomly writing down to-do items in sequence, high priority items may end up on the 2nd or 3rd pages, which will be overlooked if you follow the - finish the 1st page before you move to the next - instruction;<br><br>2. By using paper, it's very difficult to assign/use due date reminders;<br><br>3. Just like any To-do list, it doesn't give you any indication of interdependencies and the time required for executing a task;<br><br>4. With no priorities indicated, everything is "equal", left to your "feeling" (and whim?) as to which one to do;<br><br>4. As far as I'm concerned, a to-do item doesn't get done (at least 80% of the time) until it's in your calendar with a realistic time estimate;<br><br>One may be able to keep busy and seemingly efficient (albeit likely not effective) by using this system, but the latter is not the right objective</div>

<div class="content">Oops, my post above sounded like I posted the comment I showed before, I posted a response to it, not that comment.  My comment hasn't been published yet.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the link to the article. I posted a review as well.<br><br>in a nutshell, AF has helped me go further than GTD.  With GTD I had lists of things to do by context, but not solid means of working those lists to completion.<br><br>Charles<br></div>

<div class="content">If you click through the the negative reviewers website you will see why he doesn't like AF - he'd be out of a job!</div>

<div class="content">I also posted a response and then went to his web site and was looking at some of his articles.  He is actually proposing, in one of them, that people assign priorities, etc to tasks (not all that unusual) but then drag each of them to the calendar icon (in Outlook) to assign each task to specific times on the calendar.  I want to be fair, but this is madness.  Obviously we have to assign due dates for something that is absolutely due on that date (although in autofocus we will usually get it done before that date) but to assign all tasks to a time in a calendar is just asking for increased stress and chaos. <br><br>I do want to be fair, but his is a system that people play with when they first learn about the power of Outlook and then quickly abandon when they find they are not getting everything done and are spending so much time maintaining the system.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks to all for your comments on the blog article. You've covered all the points so well between you that I haven't found it necessary to add anything myself!</div>

<div class="content">@Mark - the power of getting other people to work for you is great isn't it?<br><br>Chris, believe it or not, I used to try to maintain this type of scheduling in Outlook.  And yes, it was madness. :-)<br></div>

<div class="content">Chris/Jacqueline:<br><br>Good points!  I'm wondering if Outlook is used by many people (including me till AF came along) in such a way it should be renamed INlook!  GROAN, I know!<br><br>I think Michael Linenberger's TWC approach is good, and I've retained a few aspects of it, but even that has too much overhead, which is seemingly (really?) absent from AF - ask me and David Drake!<br><br>I've NEVER kept going at one system like I have with AF, and with comparable results.  <br><br>And NO, it is NOT a To Do List!</div>
