<div class="content">There seems to be quite a bit of confusion about the meaning of the word "urgent" as used in the rules for the use of Column 2.<br><br>There's no mystery about it. I'm using the word in the standard dictionary definition of "requiring immediate action or attention."<br><br>It's essential to understand the difference between urgency and importance. As Covey's Four Quadrants suggest something may be urgent and important, urgent but not important, important but not urgent, or neither urgent nor important.<br><br>Column 2 in SuperFocus is for 1) unfinished tasks and 2) urgent tasks. The urgent tasks may or may not be important, but they gain their place in Column 2 because they are urgent, not because they are important.<br><br>Take the case of doing the dishes after a meal. On the face of it, it's not very urgent nor very important.<br><br>But if you have a policy that you will wash the dishes before you start preparing the next meal, then you have defined the task's urgency as quite high. It's still not important though.<br><br>Imagine you are working for a gangster and it's HIS policy that you will wash the dishes before you start preparing the next meal otherwise you end up in the harbour with your feet in a concrete block. Then the task has become very important. But the degree of urgency is exactly the same (... before you start preparing the next meal).<br><br>Remember: it's urgency,not importance that qualifies a task for Column 2.</div>

<div class="content">Then there's another level of urgency: "If you don't start washing those dishes in 30 seconds, you're in deep trouble!"  I think these don't go in either column.</div>

<div class="content">Obviously things that TRUELY need IMMEDIATE action (eg leave the building that just caught on fire) are just done immediately without ever being written down... That's just common sense and anyway our survival instinct will have us act almost in spite of ourselves in such cases.<br><br>Mark, that post is very helpful for any SF newcomer and doesnt deserve to end up drowned up in this forum. I think any SF newbie should be provided this kind of info without having to look hard for it. Any reason why you didnt make it a daily tip?</div>

<div class="content">Daouda:<br><br><< Any reason why you didnt make it a daily tip? >><br><br>Because I use this forum as a place to work out ideas. This one is not yet ready to have a permanent place.</div>

<div class="content">Mark : fair enough, and interesting to know that you havent permanently set this idea in stone, at least in its current state.</div>

<div class="content">Mark : I supposed this could be the case, which is also what I meant by "not in its current state".<br>It's great that you aim to give tips and instructions that are as clear and precise as they can be, without leaving room for misinterpretation. I bet you've seen the latter happen too frequently on this website and really want to prevent it as much as possible !</div>
