<div class="content">David C:<br><br>It's not a bad principle as long as the people you are working with aren't using it as well.<br><br>If they are, then you send an email to a colleague and they don't reply for 48 hours and there's something in their reply you want further information about, you wait for another 48 hours to send your query and, if they then have to check with someone else, they will wait for 48 hours to contact the other person who will then wait 48 hours to reply to them. They then wait 48 hours before replying to you. I've lost count of how many days that is. 10?</div>

<div class="content">Ha ha. This made me think of Correspondence Chess - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondence_chess" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondence_chess</a> .<br><br>I think my dad attempted to play this (by mail) way back in the day.<br><br>An interesting point from the article:  "[. . .] a game played by post between players in different countries might last several years."  Not that there's anything wrong with that!  ;-]</div>

<div class="content">Great idea - why do so many things seem urgent and why do we feel pressure to react to them when in reality they are not? <br>Mark: new system - "Do it next week" - over to you....</div>

<div class="content">The general principle that I adhere to that is similar to this is "creating margin in the moment of execution".  Rather than reacting to a situation, I first see if I can create margin (mental, time, financial or otherwise) at the point of execution.<br><br>This concept has helped my FortNite game, my Tennis win ratio, my satisfaction in negotiation situations, etc.  It has been revolutionary to me since I first uncovered the concept (whilst playing FortNite, incidentally)</div>
