<div class="content">I've often wondered if the secret sauce of fidelity to a system is to:<br><br>a. Create one yourself<br>b. Teach it others<br><br>"One of the reasons that I [teach] GTD [is because it's] the best way to keep myself motivated. You know, it’s a little embarrassing to stand up and do seminars and do coaching with people if I don’t do this stuff myself, so often times that’s my (this is a big secret folks, so don’t tell anybody), but one of the reasons I do all this [...] it keeps me honest."<br><br>- David Allen<br><a href="http://gettingthingsdone.com/2016/09/episode-21-optimizing-your-gtd-system/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://gettingthingsdone.com/2016/09/episode-21-optimizing-your-gtd-system/</a></div>

<div class="content">Actually, you're one of the people I was thinking about vis-a-vis the observation above. I do wonder if you'd have the motivation to create/use productivity systems without an audience. <br><br>So far, I'm on month two using my Moment by Moment system w/ Evernote. I do think posting about my system online has helped me stick with the program.</div>

<div class="content">avrum:<br><br>I do sometimes think to myself what would have happened if I had just stuck with my first published system like David Allen has with his. One thing I'm quite certain about is that I would have made a great deal more money than I in fact have!</div>

<div class="content"><<I would have made a great deal more money >><br><br>You're probably right. At it's peak, Autofocus 1 was being talked about quite a bit. Often, recommended as a substitute for GTD. <br><br>I think David and you have unique contributions to this space. Though, I prefer your mad artist approach to conjuring up new systems.</div>

<div class="content">avrum:<br><br><< At it's peak, Autofocus 1 was being talked about quite a bit. >><br><br>Well in fact I was thinking of the system in my first book "Get Everything Done". I never tried to make any money out of any of the Autofocus systems - which I developed after I had retired.</div>

<div class="content">I actually think the system changing and experimenting is one of the secrets to Mark's genius. The systems fill an important gap in GTD: deciding what to do next and keeping up a flow from one thing to the next. Different systems work at different times, in different situations, and I'm sure I'm not the only one who finds a fresh system motivating in itself.<br><br>What we've all learned here is that there is no perfect system for this. In many ways the details of the system don't particularly matter - I stick with one until the flow inevitably starts to run down, switch to another from the large menu, and keep going!<br><br>I've had a pretty stable GTD/OmniFocus system for keeping track of projects for years, and finding Mark's work (about a year ago) has been a brilliant addition to that specifically on the action side of things. (The one piece of Mark's advice I don't follow is to not feed the No List list from a bigger list - I use OmniFocus, and feed a 'no list' list from it. But I feel free to add things to the 'no list' that are not in the larger system.)</div>

<div class="content"><<Different systems work at different times ...>><br><br>I was speaking to my clinical supervisor about my interest in productivity systems, literature, etc. She asked if my efforts were fuelled by principle, or anxiety. I think that was a interesting question/observation. <br><br>I've been using some variation of my current system for at least a year (and my current system for appx 3 months now). I've noticed a pattern: my desire to hack the rules, or try out a new piece of software, etc., often follow an uncomfortable feeling. If I resist the temptation to muck around with what is currently working, the feeling passes. <br><br>But it's true, what works for me, may not work for others.</div>
