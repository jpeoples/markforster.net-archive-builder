<div class="content">Ha. The question needs more clarity. This should do:<br><br>What are your top three non-digital/internet-related tools?<br><br>The "no mind or body-related" is only in there to prevent these two predictable beauties:<br><br>"I use......... my MIND!"<br>"I use only my super-mental-discipline and the white-hot magma power of my unrefined pure raw male grit!"<br><br><br>The rest are to prevent stock answers like:<br><br>Evernote<br>Clear<br>OneNote<br>Toodledo<br>iPad<br>iPhone<br>Android</div>

<div class="content">Can't help thinking this is a bit like asking Andy Murray the top three tools that he used to win Wimbledon, no mention of any tennis-related items allowed.<br><br>My top three (bearing in mind that these come a long way down the list after the forbidden items):<br><br>A paper diary<br>A loose-leaf folder (with paper)<br>A land-line telephone<br><br>In reality of course just about everything I make happen is either done through the internet in one way or another or with task-specific tools (lawnmower, car, screwdriver, walking boots, etc).</div>

<div class="content">Hi all<br>The most important vehicle to drive my impetus is continually answering these 2 questions.<br><br>"Why am I bothering to do this at all?"<br><br>"What makes this more important to do now/soon than all else I could be doing?"<br><br><br><br><br>Also I agree with what Chris says: Have a clear vision of the next (doable) step to ensure progress (and hopefully momentum will kick in as a gift)  LOL! <br><br>Bottom line: I make sure I'm doing the right work via choosing MITs on a will do list.  Then I (usually mentally) break it down into doable steps.</div>

<div class="content">I LOVE having hot wings and barbeque wings, coleslaw and ice cream as a reward. I can work longer and harder knowing that I have them waiting as my reward.  I do this a few times a week for a special lunch. LOL!  I never get bored of it as it also ensures a lot gets done in the morning.</div>

<div class="content">1. Timeboxing, or more accurately "timeslicing" -- cycling through a list of tasks, spending a short chunk of time (5-15 minutes, depending on how much I resist it) on each task before going on to the next one.  Best procrastination buster I've ever found.<br><br>2. Due dates for tasks that *have* to be done by a certain day or time.<br><br>3. Flagging of tasks that I *want* to do today.<br><br> - Erik.</div>

<div class="content">These are the answers I was after! Outstanding.<br><br>Mind/body related answers are perfect as long as you avoid the above two vague examples and their cousins.</div>

<div class="content">Chocolate, reward systems, Time Timers, an index card briefcase or style of index card, a special notebook, focus-directing questions, specific routines, habits, time-management systems, acronyms, problem-solving systems, and project-management systems are all potentially illuminating answers.<br><br>"I use my MIND!", is funny, but vague.<br><br>"I sprint at top speed for one minute, 3x, first thing in the morning." is a great answer.<br><br>"My most used tool is my body..." or "I work out!" need more specificity.</div>

<div class="content">A little more serious this time.<br><br>1.  Be clear about the next action to move something forwards.  Things often drift because it's not clear what's happening next and who owns it.<br><br>2.  Don't capture every little thing, it leads to paralysis by analysis and provides a convenient distraction from getting things done.<br><br>3.  Get a full 8-9 hour quota of sleep as often as possible, every night if possible.  It makes a huge difference to your ability to focus and desire to work on things.</div>

<div class="content">Thank you for this question.  I prefer the low tech methods, as I really like crossing stuff off my list with a pen.  My top three are:<br><br>1. Spiral notebook - with a daily to do list and other notes and lists<br>2. Daily, weekly, and monthly checklists for routine tasks and personal development activities (read, exercise, practice piano, write a personal note)<br>3. Timer - don't use it all the time, but some tasks specify a time limit.<br><br>This is my first post, so thanks to Mark for this forum.  I purchased and read Do It Tomorrow and then foolishly gave it away.  So I guess I am using my own version of DIT.</div>

<div class="content">1. Tickler file (43 folders).<br><br>2. Checklists for all the routine stuff.<br><br>3. A daily B.A.M. list, consisting of: (B) big three tasks to take significant action on to consider today successful, (A) appointments, and other (M) must-do-today tasks.<br><br>(The truth is that I do use forbidden [for this poll's purpose] digital tools for much of the above, although I could remain effective if everything here were done on paper.)</div>

<div class="content">DISCLAIMER<br>put off posting this as not sure if falls under "mind/body-related" restrictions. from other posts, seems it may not.<br><br>pre-visualization, or meditation, or prayer or just walking it through in my mind<br>usually the day before, usually to typical methods. relaxed, music, see/feel in mind.<br>this often leads to far better success than any other planning, method or trick to make something happen.<br><br>not that the something then happens magically. ( although sometimes does seem to ) I still end up making use of any of the typical methods such as mentioned from above posts. HOWEVER, what DOES happen is whatever the right method I need to use, I end up using, and if I did NOT know about it, seem to discover just whatever I need to know when I need to know it.<br><br>and if I do NOT do this. Or perhaps am doing the opposite but not on purpose (thinking about all the ways going to not get something done, screw up etc), then, wow, as if by magic, I don't use the method I need to use, or mess up, or don't learn what is needed.<br><br>if I know this method. then how come I still don't use it regularly? another topic.</div>
