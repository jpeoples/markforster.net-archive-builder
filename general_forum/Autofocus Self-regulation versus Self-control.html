<div class="content">My impression is that Autofocus is about working as long as possible in the mental state of  self-regulation. Only if tasks have to be done at certain times/dates or if you have to do a tasks that you are not motivated to do, you schedule the tasks and work in the mode/state of self-control (aka self-discipline).<br><br>Research has shown that is far easier to work using self-regulation than to use self-control. Self-control requires much more mental energy than self-regulation  <br>(e.g. <a href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=taking-the-reins&print=true)" rel="nofollow">http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=taking-the-reins&print=true)</a>  .<br><br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Self-control can be more intensive, but has a bigger ultimate pay-off.<br><br>For a more raw, intense way to gain mega discipline and self control, check out;<br><a href="http://www.learningthesteel.com/books" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.learningthesteel.com/books</a></div>

<div class="content">...and in a similar vein, "WILLPOWER IS NOT ENOUGH" - an analysis of willpower as engagement with six influences on behavioural choices:  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TX-Nu5wTS8" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TX-Nu5wTS8</a><br><br><br>0. how committed am I?  - what are the real reasons i want to change?<br>1. how many of the skills do i have? the knowledge?<br>2. crucial moments - when relapses are highly likely (temptations are not 24x7)<br>3. vital behaviours - find behaviours that need to be options in crucial moments<br>4. friends and accountability<br>5. how can i make the wanted behaviours easier and the unwanted behaviours harder?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Michael,<br>Cheers for the link. Interesting video actually. I'm a geek for all that Psychological stuff, which is why I got into it. But it can actually be practical too, If simplified and applied correctly.<br><br>Actually, the book I posted about gaining the willpower tools needed for mega success in anything in life, talks about the limits of willpower/discipline and how to work with them<br><a href="http://www.learningthesteel.com/books/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.learningthesteel.com/books/</a></div>

<div class="content">I think that's not right, Shamil.  Self-control is about pushing yourself to do certain things, and not do other things.  Self-regulation is about creating a process that you follow and action is easier because it's implicit in the process.  Dreams is about changing your perspective so that what you want to do matches what you dream wants done.</div>

<div class="content">In my experience, self-control, willpower, is very limited.  Self-regulation, AKA application of automatic systems and environmental triggers, is a far better method, as people have been noting in this thread.  I don't rely on just my willpower to avoid certain websites during the work day, I whip out LeechBlock and make it hard as hell to fuss with during the day.  There, done.  I've killed most of the problem of goofing around on websites.<br><br>B.J. Fogg is another interesting guy who's looked into this stuff.  He's got a site called Behavior Wizard that helps you narrow down the type of behavior you want and gives you ideas in terms of motivation, ability, and triggers to accomplish it.  I found him through Ramit Sethi, a finance guy who also does a lot with behavioral psychology.</div>
