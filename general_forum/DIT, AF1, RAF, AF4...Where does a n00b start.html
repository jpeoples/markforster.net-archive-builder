<div class="content">Given the various systems discussed, what's recommended for someone completely new? I know they are all related in some way, but I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed when it comes to choosing one.<br><br>I've just gotten Mark's DIT book in this week but haven't had a chance to read it yet. But I'm wondering if I should skip the DIT method and move onto AF4.  Granted, I understand that I need to find the method that best fits me, my work, etc.<br><br>Any suggestions?</div>

<div class="content">Go AF4.  I have not read DIT, but I understand that AF4 is very similar to DIT's method.  I think AF4 is a very slick method and reject the older ones as obsolete.  I propose you print out the AF4 method, learn its basics, and then read DIT and substitute AF4 where appropriate.<br><br>Keep in mind that the AF methods are about lists of tasks, and the DIT book discusses more than just lists so it isn't all replaced.<br><br>I think the key to making any of these methods work is to remember that you are always free to skip over a task.  If your mind is nagging you to get to something way down the list, let it pull you along until you get there.  This means you can always do what you want to do, only the List will stop you if you see something really important (that you forgot about) along the way.</div>

<div class="content">I'd agree, start off with AF4.  <br><br>I've gone all the way through Mark's systems in the books and the whole of the AF set.  Personally I'm finding that AF4 has the best balance of closure, responsiveness, flexibility, absence of guilt etc.  <br><br>However, I'd also suggest that, once you're settled into AF4 (e.g. 3-4 weeks time) taking a look at Mark's books will introduce several excellent techniques you can use to manage specific problems/periods of time.  I'd leave DIT alone until then though otherwise you may find you go into a lengthy 'tweak cycle' before you've figured out whether AF4 does the job.</div>

<div class="content">The details in the AF1 instructions might help explain some of the parts of AF4.  The AF4 instructions aren't as detailed.  <br><br>An option that you could try is to start with AF1.  It might teach you some things about how your mind handles the list.</div>

<div class="content">Jeremy - I agree start with AF4 but don't expect miracles.  I think anything that makes you think about how you spend your time is valuable and any system does this.  You need to find your own way.  The great think about Mark F is that he has some lateral thoughts about time management that are inspired.  Good luck.</div>

<div class="content">Just go with AF4.  It is simple and makes good sense and the odds are that you'll find it a good fit.  Don't load it up with tons of stuff.  Just grab some kind of notebook and start writing down what you have to do ... draw a line at the end when you are done and bingo, you now have a filled Closed List followed by an empty Open list.  Now follow the instructions, adding incomplete and new things to the end of your Open list.  It will make sense as you work the list ... it makes much less sense to hear it described.<br><br>If you want, you could watch Andreas' excellent recording of Marks day long working of the list (speeded up to hyper speed ;-)  That makes it all clear.</div>

<div class="content">I'm inclined to throw in a slightly dissenting opinion. <br><br>AF4 closely resembles the original Autofocus (AF1), which is why, as has been already pointed out, you can get a better understanding of the underlying principles from the original (AF1) instructions. Compared to AF1 and AF4, AF2 and AF3 (RAF) very strongly stress urgency. They look like aberrations to me, and therefore I never quite understood why Mark came out with them (although I remember the discussions that resulted in 'reverse mode'). AF4 is much closer to the spirit of Autofocus, and I came back to use AF (in a way) with AF4, which is probably the undisputedly best version of AF. <br><br>However, one size won't fit all. It all comes down to your specific work (and life) situation. If your work is driven by urgency, RAF (AF3) is worth a look. AF (all versions) is probably at its best when you're working alone (even more so, from home). <br><br>Personally, I had many problems with AF (stopped using it after AF1) because of me being a member of a team/hierarchy with a highly structured workflow with much back-and-forth interaction and many very short deadlines (less than a day, but longer than 'immediate'), while still having a lot of important, longer-term 'background' projects. It's the latter ones that have always been the major problem for me (with any time management system). Another problem I keep having with AF is that most of my tasks are quite complex and not easily broken down into 'little and often' chunks, because it takes way too long to 'get into it' every time. <br><br>To me, DIT seems to play a lot nicer with the timescale of those deadlines. It's more structured than AF, and it has different lists for different types of urgencies/deadlines ('tomorrow', 'today', 'immediate'). In addition, AF doesn't really accommodate 'Waiting for' and 'Agenda' items (both are GTD terms) very well, while both are easier to incorporate in DIT (IMHO).<br><br>That being said, I would recommend to give DIT a fair chance. It might fit your work, your life or your personality just fine. OTOH, DIT takes quite a bit of discipline to stick to it in the long run, and many people (me included) tend to 'fall off the wagon'. Procrastination-busting seems to be where AF shines most.<br><br>Recently, I started to tinker with a combination of DIT and AF4. AF4 looks like a good candidate to tackle the DIT 'backlog' (not to be confused with the AF4 'backlog'). DIT should give me some up-front structure, while I still wanted to use the strengths of AF(4). However, I soon started to experience a dominance of 'DIT mode' over 'AF mode', much like I (and others) experienced with some additions to the original AF1 (like an 'urgency card'). It's too early for conclusions, though.<br><br>Closing remark: As has already been stated, DIT is more of a complete 'system' than AF, so many elements and principles of DIT can be used in conjunction with AF.</div>

<div class="content">Read the book. It's great! And if you want to understand the principles behind Mark's thinking it's worthwhile. There is a fantastic "closed list" exercise in there which was innocuous but very profound.</div>

<div class="content">As far as the Autofocus systems go, AF4 is the most developed and balanced. For most people it will be the best. Do it.<br><br>But AF4 will work many, many times better if you have a more profound understanding of the principles that underlie it. And those principles can best be grasped by reading the DIT book.<br><br>The DIT book has many wonderful ideas that can make you more productive, whatever particular system you use. Just in case you think that I am an uncritical Forster groupie, I will add that I found the DIT book much more helpful than his book titled Get Everything Done.<br><br>So, my recommendation for newbies is to start AF4 today. Everything you need is on this site. The first item to put on your AF4 list is "Buy the DIT" book. Once it arrives, read it. Once you have studied the DIT book, the power of AF4 will be multiplied.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks to all for everyone for the advice.<br><br>Looks like AF4 will be my starting point. May not be the end point for me, but I've got to start somewhere. Will definitely be reading DIT as well.</div>

You don't want to start with an empty Closed List, but you also don't want pages of old list items in the Closed List.<br><br>All the best in your AF4 startup. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">AF4. Simple. Powerful. And as others have noted. you can watch Mark demonstrate the process by looking at Andreas's presentation.</div>

Then I closed my first list.  <br><br>Well, processing those Look tasks generated tasks that went into the Open list (and some that went into a calendar and some that went into a Someday/Maybe list).  <br><br>When I got tired of processing a repository, I simply stopped and following AF4 instructions moved the Look task to the back of my open list.  I'll get back to it soon.</div>
