<div class="content">Mostly, I like paper, but every so often I think how nice it would be for the computer to manage the list of recurring tasks. (I've been known to check something off and forget to rewrite it.)<br><br>Most programs now have a good range of repeat instructions, including start dates and deadlines and choice of repeat by due date or date completed.<br><br>None of the programs I've looked at let you edit the date completed, and I just spent 30 minutes searching. Every program with a forum has it as an "often requested feature", but they haven't actually done it.<br><br>Some days I don't update the list, and if that's followed by a few days offlist (such as weekends or errand days), the "next due" dates are all too late.<br><br>The only one that lets you change date completed is Sciral Consistency, but that's missing several other features.<br><br>Any suggestions before I try set up another paper chart?</div>

<div class="content">Cricket,<br><br>OmniFocus does this wonderfully, but it is only for the Mac OS. I am pretty sure there are iPhone/iPad versions now, so it may be an option even if you don't use Mac computers.<br><br>Otherwise, wouldn't a spreadsheet with a date field suffice? Not as nice as a dedicated app, but better than paper.</div>

<div class="content">Sorry, Cricket: not sure I understand the issue: why can't you just change the "next due" date on your overdue tasks?</div>

<div class="content">The log would still be incorrect. I don't look back more than a few instances, but it would bug me if it's inaccurate. Also, rather than making one field be correct, I'd have an incorrect field and one I have to remember to change manually -- but the whole idea of electronic is it does it all for me.</div>

<div class="content">With a spreadsheet, you could have a "DUE" column and a "DONE" column. When you finish a task, duplicate the row and enter the next DUE date, and keep it sorted by DUE. The DONE column leaves you with a log, and you could sort by DONE if you want to look back chronologically.</div>

<div class="content">I need to try the spreadsheet method again. Last time, it didn't flow. I spent more time maintaining the spreadsheet then enjoying marking things off. That might be the case with all electronic systems, it's hard to tell. It's tempting to program one myself. It would be a great learning project, but not terribly useful for time management for several months (if ever).</div>

<div class="content">There was a DWM spreadsheet in Excel that was quite elegant. I used it for more than a year. I thought that it flowed just fine, plus there were the wonderful advantage of searchability and neatly printed letters.</div>

<div class="content">I highly recommend ToDoList (<a href="http://www.abstractspoon.com/)" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.abstractspoon.com/)</a> it's highly configurable and you can easily correct start and completed dates.</div>

<div class="content">Good suggestion on the ToDoList app, Maureen.  <br><br>The workable link (because it has a space behind it) is <a href="http://www.abstractspoon.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.abstractspoon.com/</a> .  It ticks me off right away when they do not say at the top whether or not it is for Mac, Windows, or both (ToDoList is only for Windows).  <br><br>It was an interesting read, though.  I noticed on the page "ToDoList 6.4 Feature Release" <br>(<a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5371/ToDoList-6-4-Feature-Release-An-effective-and-flex" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5371/ToDoList-6-4-Feature-Release-An-effective-and-flex</a> ), one of the items listed is "Added support for military time to start/due/completed time droplists".  <br><br>As a side-note, whilst browsing the site, I ran into this article which had some points in it that I definitely have had some issues with before:<br><br>"Tips and Tricks to Rescue Overdue Projects"<br><a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/77927/Tips-and-Tricks-to-Rescue-Overdue-Projects" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/77927/Tips-and-Tricks-to-Rescue-Overdue-Projects</a></div>

<div class="content">Have a gander at EMACS Org Mode. Plain text, works on many many platforms (Mac OSX, Windows [all flavours], Linux...). You can have repeats, start | due| completed dates, tags, filters, agendas all together or in separate files as you see fit. Beauty is plain text not locked to an application or platform.<br><br>This is for folks whom electronic is the method they like, otherwise plain paper and pen | pencil.</div>

<div class="content">So far as I remember, toodledo allows you to set tasks to repeat from the date completed, instead of the date due ... would that solve it for you?<br><br>nb I don't use toodledo anymore and didn't use this feature when I did!<br><br>acedia xx</div>

<div class="content">Acedia, If I start a computer-free few days (great way to get work done) by cleaning the fish tank on day 1, then go back to the computer on day 3, it would tell me to do it again on day 10. It should be on day 8. I could edit the next due date, perhaps.<br><br>Arnold, A quick look shows Emacs Org doesn't run easily on Windows. Did I miss something?</div>

<div class="content">Had very little problems with the newer installs (can even be installed as non admin for corp machines).<br><br>Google emacs org mode winxp.<br><br>Used this website to get an understanding of Org Mode and using day to day (agenda/tasks). Did a very basic install. Can post the 'header' section I use (blank emacs org file) that could make it easier.<br><<a href="http://members.optusnet.com.au/~charles57/GTD/>" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://members.optusnet.com.au/~charles57/GTD/></a></div>

<div class="content">Here is the basic template used for org mode.<br><br>~~~~~~~~~~<br>#+SEQ_TODO: TODO(t) STARTED(s) WAITING(w) APPT(a) | DONE(d) CANCELLED(c) DEFERRED(f)<br>#+STARTUP: logdone<br>#+STARTUP: wordwrap<br>#+MODE: org; fill-column: 72 -*-<br>#+STARTUP: overview<br>#+STARTUP: indent<br>#+STARTUP: auto-fill-mode<br><br>~~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>Install EMACS (I used the gnu version) which will have org support files included. Then create one file ending in '.org' paste the above into the file. Close and reload the .org file.</div>
