<div class="content">Hi all, <br>I am having the strangest reaction...and am wondering if it is due to AF. I have been doing AF since the first day and find myself doing things I have put off for years. Like, this afternoon I got my ipod speakers working and all set up in my kitchen and I have had these speakers (a xmas present) for something like 3 years! <br><br>I am cleaning out cabinets and drawers and desks---things that have been hanging me up AND repelling me for years..though I really wanted to do them. I am printing out boarding passes for an upcoming trip and packing up the dog's travel bag. All these strange things, way ahead of time, but on my list and mind none the less.<br><br>I think that rather than my usual running away or avoiding or trying to discipline myself, I am really getting stuff done that has bothered me and also that I have all but given up that I would ever be able to do them and I am so surprised by how easy it is and also how important they are to me. <br><br>Now along with all of this good stuff, I find myself crying and feeling lonely, and vulnerable as well. All new feelings. I am wondering if I have found a way to unwedge a rock, and now blocked emotions are flowing? That's what it feels like. Cooking dinner tonight and listening to my ipod on my "new" Xmas speakers brought me to tears and to another era in my life as well. Very tender things. Seeing my armoire with my sweaters culled, de-cat furred, and all folded neatly brings strong emotion as well. Knowing that this whole place will come together and that I will be able to work at my work is incredible to me.<br><br>Does anyone else relate to this? Any similar feelings? Trish<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Trish -  I can totally relate.  I've completed things I've been putting off for ages - it releases so much energy  -- this huge dam has had a chunk taken out and things are flowing. My emotional release takes the form of joy.<br><br>I recently finished writing something that moved my masters project ahead. Since then, I've been working on a ton of stuff that has to do with getting a job. My sense of self is changing as I complete these tasks. It is as if I am finally able to become the person I've always known I could be. It's a beautiful thing. <br><br>Thanks for being so honest and sharing your experiences.<br><br>cheers, rani</div>

<div class="content">Trish: Everything is connected.  I've also felt a lot of emotional release around things I've done via AutoFocus -- and also things I've dismissed.  In fact, the strongest reactions have been around the things I realized I was not going to do -- no matter how long they had been on my list.  AutoFocus gave me a structure for saying "No".  Of course I can change my mind later, but for now... Begone you ungrateful tasks!</div>

<div class="content">Very interesting, Trish. I wonder if procrastination serves as a defense mechanism in a sense. When we stop using that means of coping, we can feel both positive and negative emotions. The positive comes from the hope for a new and different lifestyle. The negative comes from the regret about time and opportunities lost. Hoping the negative emotions are short-lived for you. Listen to some dancing music on those new speakers. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">THANKS, Trish! I think maybe my process is just a little behind you .... so I am very glad you posted so I won't be too surprised when those feelings come up for me! I too am getting some important stuff done, in an "effortless" kind of way, and I have been pretty sure this effect will "spill over" when I get to those things that have been on my "list" for years (my back-logged mental to-do list, not my AF list yet) , but that I just haven't done, but are nonetheless VERY important to me! I can't believe that today I got some preliminary work done on my taxes! This is just unheard of, for me. I recall last year I was madly scrambling on THE last day! <br><br>I also look forward to setting up an xmas present I got two years ago! In the meantime, just today I was thinking that it is going to take some time for me to adjust to this strange new place I find myself in ... I am really GETTING STUFF DONE! I am finding the "lack of struggle" a little stressful even, in that I worry it won't last or that I have to hurry and take advantage of THAT moment of doing something ... hard to explain. <br><br>I haven't actually dismissed anything from my lists yet, and I certainly haven't added *everything* from my backlogged other lists. I haven't totally figured out how to handle "work" vs "home" tasks and tasks that were previously very aversive to me, are still aversive (but at least I am getting some better insights around them.) So I haven't got AF really "down" yet, but something different sure is happening for me, and it's surprising and unsettling, although very positive ! Thanks again for posting on your experience.</div>

<div class="content">For me it's a lot of unused aggression that's showing up and wants<br>to be directed, curbed and geared to new goals.<br><br>But I try to take it with good humour, something like :<br><br>    Fiona: "You didn't slay the dragon, Shrek?"<br><br>    Shrek: "Well, it's on my list!"</div>

<div class="content">Hi Trish<br><br>Thank you for a great post which has started a really good thread.  Everything that has been said above is so true and I think Mel's observation that procrastination serves as a defence mechanism absolutely hits the nail on the head.<br><br>Bev says "I haven't got AF really "down" yet, but something different sure is happening for me, and it's surprising and unsettling, although very positive !" and I think that really sums up how AF can "get to us".  For me, the fact that AF is more than just a tool to get things done but has enabled me to look at *why* I procrastinate has been a major part of the key in actually letting it work.  Things we would not admit even to ourselves can be faced in a non-threatening environment.  No-one else has to know what is on our list, or what we choose to allow to be rejected - and we face what we are learning "at the right time".<br><br>It is unsettling to a degree and I think is a side-effect that none of us anticipated when we first started - Mark, perhaps a health warning on side effects needs to be added to the tin! :-)<br><br>Now I'm off to add "set up digital tape player" to my list - Christmas present from last year!  Is there a pattern here?  :-)<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Thanks for all the thoughtful responses! Who knew? But I couldn't imagine that I was the only one. I do think in my case procrastination serves a purpose..I am used to the problems I have, dream of the day when I will figure out a way around them or through them, and here comes AF and I am gliding through them without effort. I had a vision of what it would be like and this isn't it---actually maybe this is it! I knew it didn't have to be HARD. But common wisdom says I am nuts in that desire.<br><br>I am following my intuition with all of this and disappearing the "crud" before I get to the "real work" and it is scary to trust this process because what if I never get to the "real work"--novel writing and money earning--but I am hellbent on trusting this process and seeing what happens when I do go with my intuition. I don't really have any choice anyway.<br>My intuition is stronger than I am.<br><br>So grateful to have a place to report in with this stuff. Trish</div>

<div class="content">Trish,<br><br>Yeah, roads not taken and all.  I think those emotions can be painful, enjoyed, or many other things.  I would suggest that emotions can be a choice.  Once you have mourned some of those roads not taken, you can choose to move on.<br><br>One thing you can think about is that you are a product of all of your roads, those taken and those not.  You can't be anyone but who you are so you might as well enjoy yourself in the knowledge that you are who you are because of all of those past choices ... and the result is probably pretty good.<br><br>BTW, I would take it as an important sign that you are having a strong emotional reaction.  Emotions come from all of these subconscious things we have been discussing recently.  To me it indicates that the changes you are making are profound, not superficial.</div>

<div class="content">YES Christine, I think there should *definitely* be a warning label on the "AF tin" !! (BTW I have been enjoying/appreciating all your posts, as so many others have also noted!)<br><br>I just wanted to add that I spent quite a few months last year delving deeply into my "procrastination" issues ... spent hours reading about procrastination, listening to materials, even bought a self-hypnosis course in hopes it would help! I do think all of it helped a little bit ... although I still felt basically I was using a "brute force" approach and it was rather a tortuous struggle, although I did get my big aversive project completed (albeit much later than I had hoped.)<br><br>Contrast to my experience since the start of the AF beta ... I am just getting stuff done!! I am just not getting "stuck" as much, in my life. I was bemoaning (pre AF) that one reason it was so hard for me to do things was because it was so hard to plan, (and hence get anything done) due to health issues. Now it doesn't seem to matter ... when I am unwell I take whatever break I need; when I feel better, I can just return to my AF list and it seems easy to pick things up where I left off. <br><br>This IS a strange new wonderful place I am in .... and I really don't know what to make of it, (and just hope it lasts). Some of the "issues" I *thought* I had ... not knowing if it was "procrastination" or "difficulty making transitions" or some kind of  "attention problem" etc etc ... they seem to have faded away somehow .. I'm just doing things now !!!  This is completely amazing and yes, UNSETTLING !! But wonderful, too ...</div>

<div class="content">Hi Bev<br><br>Thank you for the nice comments. It's funny isn't it how so much of the self-help stuff out there may identify the issues we have surrounding procrastination, perfectionism, attention deficit, stress etc., but leave us thinking, "yes it makes sense but I can't do it!"  I think "self-help" is one of the biggest mis-nomers around because the last thing a lot of these books etc do is teach us how to really help ourselves.  Knowing the answers isn't enough.  Knowing how to help others find the answers is great but leaves us believing that we're the only ones none of this stuff works for - ergo I am a failure.  <br><br>And then ............ along comes AF - an innocuous little idea, cunningly disguised in an understated notepad, complete with Bic Biro (Cristal of course Mark :-), and bam! like the proverbial ton of bricks we're hit with an almost addict like desire to "do" - and to do the stuff we've been running from - and it's easy!  All of a sudden we know how to "help ourselves" - well maybe not all of a sudden - takes a few days :-) and all of those self-help books can be consigned to recycling, or sold on e-Bay with the TM T-Shirts.<br><br>I think self-help books are great in identifying why but often that's where they leave you.  AF identifies why and then says "ok, so what are you going to do about it?"  And that's where the choice is made - to go back to where we were or say "hey, so that's my problem - ok, time to let it go, right another item crossed off - next page........"</div>

<div class="content">@Trish - I just can't "think" in the clutter of not only my environment but in my mind.  AF has been clearing this out for me and I'm not sure what will happen when I (quickly I'm sure) get to the point that I can think!  One thing I know - I'll be able to trust myself when I get there.  AF is proving that to be true!</div>
