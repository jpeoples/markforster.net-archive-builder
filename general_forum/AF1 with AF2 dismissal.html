<div class="content">I don't think this has come up, but in working with the AF2 dismissal, I preferred it to the AF1 dismissal method.  <br><br>Could AF1 still work properly by doing something more similar to the AF2 dismissal rule?  I was thinking (if one worked through their pages daily - which I do when I use AF1), you could use the same rule?  <br></div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline:<br><br>Interesting thought. But what would you do if you were unwilling to do any items on a page - just leave them?<br><br>I'll be interested to hear if you can make this work for you.</div>

<div class="content">Mark, I push myself when I come to that situation.  I always find one thing that I'm drawn to, but sometimes have to have a little conversation with myself over actually doing it.  It's working out fine.  I was thinking more in terms of other people who find dismissal difficult.  :-)<br><br>I'm not sure if it's because I'm getting better at overruling the inner brat that says "I don't want to do this and you can't make me" (thanks to AF!) or if I'm improving my list, but I find I'm dismissing less and less all the time.  I only dismiss about 1-2 things per page now.  That seems about right?<br><br></div>

<div class="content">I don't think I ever dismissed more than one or two things per page with AF1 except when I dumped a load of old tasks into the list (which would already have built up a good load of resistance).</div>

<div class="content">Why not just leave them?  The Inexorable Line Of Doom will be rolling along soon enough. Have I missed something?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Will<br><br>"The Inexorable Line Of Doom" ! ! !   ROTFL!  Thank you for that hearty laugh to start my day.  That line is so delicious that I'm tempted to add that rule to my weekly DIT just so that I can say the phrase!  Actually, it might help me to force a decision for my Wednesday Project round=up day.  I do tend to drag my feet about deciding what to dismiss from that list.....hmmmmm......you've got me thinking....."The Inexorable Line Of Doom....Do It or Let It Out of Limbo with a decent burial.....hmmmmm<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Because I'm .not using AF2 Will, I'm using AF1 - but I liked the "Inexorable Line of Doom" concept a lot!.  I'm just not keen on dismissing whole pages, as I don't think most people are.</div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline,<br><br>Sorry for being dim. I thought you were suggesting a simple switch of dismissal rules whilst maintaining the AF1 review sequence.<br><br>Learning,<br><br>Oh dear... I'd feel terrible if I my smooth and facile wordplay had corrupted your "will do" list. Trying to think of something similar for DIT which keeps the commitment to actually doing the whole list. <br><br>And failing. <br><br>Anyone?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Will<br>I do a weekly version of DIT. It's almost fool-proof!  It's flexibility aides your resolve rather than being a vehicle to lure it away. Another huge benefit is that a weekly format accepts adjustments better.  It's hard to wreck it unless you're hell-bent on doing so!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Learning, can you explain more about your weekly DIT approach? Do you process next week what comes in this week? How do you handle urgent matters? TIA</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mel<br>My brain isn't really up to par today but I'll try to highlight it.  You do it almost identically to daily DIT except you're you're pulling your daily MIT's from last week's incoming and project progress charts.  Of course, you still can add something tomorrow that came in today if it would be a better use of your time.  Afterall you have a week to finish the stuff!<br>And, when absolutely necessary, there's the below the line option.  Below the line is also great when you finish your work early and you want to free up another day.  <br>Because it's a weekly format, you need to have strict office hours.  Otherwise, Monday through Wednesday, your leisure time might get sacrificed in attempt to churn out a weeks worth of work.  The checklist covers the regular occuring chores and acts as a vehicle to conveniently batch your work. (email, inbox, calls, etc)  I use round-up days for my broad categories.(Accounts round-up, Projects review/plan round-up, Detail Housework round-up , etc) On the exact day, that category must be completed but I can chip away at it on previous days.<br><br>The beauty part is that it's VERY flexible and also it ensures that your work doesn't bleed into your leisure time unless you pre-scheduled over-time to free up a future day(s)...example: vacation , all day special event, or an all day work party.  The flexibility also accomdates emergencies, opportunities, wellness, sickness, etc.  The flexibility aspect works with your resolve and aims, not against it.<br><br>Also the flexibility allows you the ease of doing your normal habits and giving the ebb and flow of life to happen with a welcome attitude while maintaining control over nonsense distractions or wasting time on piddling stuff at the expense of what you deem to be worthwhile (even if it's not the exciting stuff)<br><br>You learn to measure your efforts against your aims within the work hours allotted.  That alone keeps reminding me the reason I'm doing the scut....to free myself up for the grander aspects of living...........inviting the passion of your life's work, cuddling a baby, learning something new, taking in a cultural event, sharing a cool one with friends, community work, etc...whatever you consider the grand aspects of living.<br>learning as I go<br>learning as I go<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Mel<br>I'd recommend reviewing Mark's book again.  There's things such as current initiative, time boxing, backlogs, etc......but it's more than the how to's he offers......It's his reasoning that really helps to know what prompted his suggestions and solutions.<br>Then you can set up your own lab and customize it to your personal needs with the assistance of his expertise. The attitude of the book invites you to think, experiment, etc within the principles....or outside of some them!  It's hard not to succeed if you're willing to tweak if necessary. ....and some tweaks are temporary....just to get over the hump!<br>I like a bit of variety to freshen things up.  The weekly format allows for lots of that!  LOL!<br><br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mel<br>Today my mind's a bit clearer.  Of course, you need to customize your own checklist.  Mine is mostly a printed copy of my normal habits and batching aid. Sometimes my checklist items will elevate to MIT status especially if I need the 30minute peace contract to be different than my Current Initiative.  It's a judgement call.<br>Also, if I'm flagging, I'll guiltlessly add below the red line, "What's better?" to right my attitude a bit.<br>The flexibility aspect allows room for these judgement calls.  Bottom line, I'm aiming to make best use of my time with the sub-goal of getting rid of the scut ASAP.  Like my working hours are used to reign in my focus and protect my leisure time, I place a limit of 90 minutes on my scut work or have it add up to no more than 9 hours a week.  True, it's necessary/important.  I'm simply being realistic about my reaction to boring work.  After it's done to my satisfaction for today or the 90minute cap, I'm free to do my more welcomed work without the nagging element.  (I might be over-reacting to the scut.....but it's my system realisticlally based on my strengths and my short-comings.  You checklist, projects handling and MIT's might be radically different.<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Learning,<br><br>You made me laugh when you wrote this:<br>"Because it's a weekly format, you need to have strict office hours. Otherwise, Monday through Wednesday, your leisure time might get sacrificed in attempt to churn out a weeks worth of work."  <br><br>You are probably one of the only people I know who wouldn't save most of it to Friday and procrastinate for the rest of the week!  (Which would be me on a bad week.)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br>ROTFL!  Just to be clear.....don't imagine a Snow White type of scene with blue birds and squirrels harmonizing to me "whistle while I work....."<br>It's more like a curmudgeon grumbling under my breath, "Get the crap over with"  ROTFL!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>It just occurred to me.....I also eat like this.  I eat my food in reverse order starting with the least favorite food on my plate, saving the best for last.   Then I can slowly savor it without the threat of the less favored foods assaulting  my taste buds. LOL!  Just a variation of "get the crap over with first! "<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Hi learning<br><br>ROTFL!  I love that!  That is just what I do - I always eat the crusts first so I can enjoy the real sandwich!<br><br>I still have very traumatic memory of nearing the end of a a prawn cocktail, having munched my way through all the lettuce and anticipating eating those juicy prawns ......... when the waiter stole it!!!!</div>
