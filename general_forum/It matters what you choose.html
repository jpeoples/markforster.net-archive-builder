<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-01-31 18:19</div>
<div class="content">In modern life there are 1000 things you can choose to do at any one time.  You might think you can do them in any order, doesn't matter.  Today, it occurs to me that's incorrect.<br><br>Whatever you choose to do opens the door for new possibilities.<br><br>If you have a project with 5 steps, you can only work on step 1.  But after you do step 1 you suddenly have a new opportunity: working on step 2.  Finish all 5 steps, and you have more new opportunities: display your project, sell it, start a more ambitious project (because of what you learned), teach others to do your project.  If the project was deck building, you now can sit on your deck.  If it was learning piano pieces you now can entertain people.  If it was watching LOST season 1, you can now watch season 2.  If you fixed your car, you can cross the country.  If you helped your neighbour, you may have a new friend to share new activities.<br><br>Whatever you do creates new opportunities.  Of those original 1000 options, some you might _never_ do.  Because the new options, opened with every choice, are better.<br><br>So choose: Not what you want now, but what you want next.</div>

<div class="content">All true, also sometimes making a choice confers an obligation as well as a possibility, so that if one watches LOST Season 1, one has to continue with Season 2, Season 3 . . .  :-)</div>
