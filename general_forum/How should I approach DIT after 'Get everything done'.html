<div class="content">Dear Niel<br><br>DIT contains my latest thinking, so I would advise reading that. It works pretty well as a whole, but there's no reason why you can't combine it with some of the techniques from GED which you find particularly useful.<br><br>Mark<br></div>

<div class="content">Hello Niel,<br><br>I have read GED, get everything done and do it tomorrow and there are parts of all the books that work for me so I have combined them into my own organisation system.  You can read about my process on my blog <a href="http://www.darktea.co.uk/blog/category/series/my-organiser/" rel="nofollow">http://www.darktea.co.uk/blog/category/series/my-organiser/</a></div>
