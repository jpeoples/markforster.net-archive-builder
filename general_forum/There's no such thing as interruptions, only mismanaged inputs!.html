<div class="content">Needs elaboration.  Fact: there are interruptions.  If I'm focused on X, and event Y stops that focus for a while, X has been interrupted.  <br><br>Does David interpret Y as an input?  I guess to not mismanage Y means to be able to cleanly either set X aside, or capture Y and return to X.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br>I have to say, each time I listen to David Allen, I get an urge to return to GTD. He's that good. Unfortunately, GTD always felt, well, silly:<br><br>Hm, what's this? Oh, a phone. Let me see here.... calls, calls... oh yes, my sick mother. Whoo, thankfully my list reminded me of: <br><br>a. my sick mother<br>b. what to do when I'm near a phone.</div>

<div class="content">My opinion: He's an excellent communicator.  He nailed the core problem.  <br><br>I fond his solution didn't work.  Mind you, I've never found a working solution until I came here, and never looked elsewhere after, so I have a limited perspective.</div>

<div class="content"><<I've never found a working solution until I came here>><br><br>For me, it's close...<br><br><< and never looked elsewhere after>><br><br>Ah, I keep looking. Reminding me of that U2 song...<br><br>Wishcraft was by far the most comprehensive, and effective, goal and task setting program. However, without any updates, apps and an audience that was often women, I found it hard to follow through with the program over time.</div>

<div class="content">I found GTD before this forum and found that GTD had several good ideas.  I just thought it got too complicated.  I never felt like contexts were that helpful for me since I work in an office and always have a phone and computer in front of me.  I felt the complexity led to too much time spent on the system as opposed to actually working.  I found the filing system, and a few lists worked great. I stripped GTD done to a simpler system which was my first ebook and is now free.<br><br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div>
