<div class="content">Say you enter a new task: "Call Mark". This is a new task, so you'd date it a month from today. You end up calling Mark, and leaving a message. He calls you back, and you agree to meet a week from today, but you need to come up with the place. You enter a new task: "Come up with restaurant for meeting with Mark.". Do you date that one month, or 7 days. <br><br>Any ideas?</div>

<div class="content">I used to treat this as 7 days. This is now a committed action rather than a possibility.<br><br>(It would be 7 days even if the meeting were a month, a year or a decade out.)</div>

<div class="content">avrum:<br><br>One month. <br><br>It doesn't matter because DWM uses single passes through the entire list (i.e. you don't circulate round individual pages). So a task on p. 30 is just as likely to get done as a task on p. 7.<br><br>I suggest "The Star" at Rusper. <a href="http://www.horshampub.co.uk/star-inn.php" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.horshampub.co.uk/star-inn.php</a></div>

<div class="content">Will: "I used to treat this as 7 days"<br>Mark: "One month"<br><br>Ok, so I'm not the only one who's confused. Onwards, I'm going with the Boss's suggestion. 30 days.</div>
