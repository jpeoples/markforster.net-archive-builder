<div class="content">One of the areas that I struggle with is on high resistant items that have a deadline. I don't want to do these but they must be done. I'll use the little and often approach but they seem to linger around forever, pushing me up to or over my deadlines. Any tips?</div>

<div class="content">Oh I have loads of these. I think there is this sweet spot between moving things forward and having too many things on the go.<br><br>Once a week I have a job called 'clear up tasks'. I use this to check my ticker/task diary and AF list for anything that is just dragging. This idea of starting is ok but I find somethings I can start, do a few mins and give up. A month later they are still there, and there is no reason for it. <br><br>The other thing I do is change the task, so rather than read x, I would change it to read 10mins of x or read 10 pages of x. That way I know I will be done in 1 month. I don't like to put those kind of tasks unless I have to because its often hard to judge the speed I will move through some jobs. But if there is a deadline then this is very useful.<br><br></div>
