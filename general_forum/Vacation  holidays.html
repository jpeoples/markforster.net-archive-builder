<div class="content">Am I right in thinking that one of the poorer aspecs of email out-of-office systems (or at least mine!) is that I have to set it when I go on vacation?    <br><br>I think I want to be able to set it a couple of weeks ahead so that the auto-reply lets folk know I am going to go on vacation - so get moving now if you are going to need something, because I don't want to spend my first week back doing stuff I could have done before I went?    Would this be the better way of managing that precious commodity called time?<br><br>Allan</div>

<div class="content">Allen, when I go on holiday for more than a couple of days, I contact everyone that I deal with regularly and let them know that I'm going to be gone.  You're right though, doing it via an auto-responder would be a better idea.  It always surprises me that I don't have a huge build-up of email when I get back, which is a great relief.  I think people often find another way of resolving their issues without involving me.  :-)<br><br></div>
