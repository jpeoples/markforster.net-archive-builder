<div class="content">I want to start tagging notes to a task in AF - basically have a brief description of the item that will fit on my one line, and then if I need some supplementary description of what to do to include it somewhere - on the left hand side of the page maybe? (I only use the right hand side for writing my tasks).  <br><br>This is kind of similar to the old Franklin Planner method I used years ago, but you would put the notes in a separate area of your notebook, if I recall.<br><br>I'm trying to think of the best way to tag these notes.  I've thought of putting a (1), (2) etc. beside the item on the left hand side preceding the task - I use the right margin for deadline dates if applicable and write the day I completed the item on the left margin so don't want to use those spaces.  Then use the next lines down on my left hand side of the paper to write the notes, preceded by the (1), (2)...<br><br>Any other ideas?  Please let me know if I've missed advice on this that's already out there somewhere in the discussion.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">You could draw lines between notes on the left page and the corresponding items on the right page... arrows... dotted lines... get visual! I think it would be easier for my eye to quickly follow a line, than to have to match up (1) on the left with (1) on the right, (2) with (2), etc. But your eye may be different :-)<br><br>Going a bit further with the concept, it could be a nice split between left-brain/right-brain "creative vs. logical" thinking. The left page is for unstructured notes and doodles and mindmaps, while the right page is an ordered logical list of items. Then connect the two with whatever lines or pointers you want to draw.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jonathan, great idea, but my notebook is coil bound though (so it lies flat), so I couldn't have an uninterrupted line.<br><br>I think I gravitate towards the notations because I spent years in audit, accounting etc. and those are common notations but they might not stand out.  I'm wondering if a highlighted colour just on the first word maybe, with the corresponding colour over on the other side, sort of like a legend in excel?<br></div>

<div class="content">Highlighting sounds very cool - as long as you have fewer notes per page than you have highlighter colors :)<br><br>Maybe try (1) (2) (3) on one double-page spread, then highlighters on the next? See which of your ideas works best in practice.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br><br>One of the things I have found is that any form of tags in the paper system by means of a margin notation or highlighting, inhibits the flow of the item scanning.  What I have found works best is to add a reference at the end of a task after a dash.  For example if an email generates a task I put it in my AutoFocus folder in Outlook and the task will have the suffix - AFe.  I can easily scan my list for all such tasks but they do not inhibit my scanning in the same way. Additional highlighting was the worst distraction - my highlighting is reserved solely for dismissed items - and only when the entire page is dismissed.<br></div>

<div class="content">My scanning has been working well with the date completed in the left margin, I just look for the items that aren't crossed off and don't have a date attached.  I need the date in the right margin for the deadlines.  And I haven't dismissed anything yet in my work notebook, although I'm sure that will occur in the future.  I'm still at the newbie stage in this job where I don't know yet what I can not do.  I wasn't thinking of highlighting the whole item, just the first word or so.  Then a short highlight may stand out.  I'm not sure, I'll have to experiment with this over the coming week and see what works.<br></div>

<div class="content">I handle this pretty much the way you described in the original post:  AF list on the right-hand pages, notes & stuff on the left-hand pages.<br><br>E.g.:  Task is "Drop off prescription at pharmacy (see left)".  Then I taped the actual prescription to the left-hand page.  Drawing an arrow works OK too.<br><br>I've also used notes like this:  "Drop off prescription at pharmacy (*1)".   Then on the left-hand page, I write (*1) and add the extra info.<br><br>Very simple, doesn't distract at all from scanning the AF list, and keeps everything handy.</div>

<div class="content">I have my tasks down the right, with the page # at the top right corner.  I keep misc notes and phone numbers on the left hand side.  I call these the reverse pages.  So I put a notation at the end of a task (see p. 12R).  That way as a task moves along to later pages, I don't have to recopy misc details.</div>

<div class="content">I like your idea of taping things to the left side Seraphim, and I have an envelope of sorts in my current book that I use to store stuff like a prescription, but I tend to just collect stuff there that I sometimes want to carry along with me - which I don't like.  Most of what I need to refer to is in an 8 1/2 x 11 size.  I would like to have a place to keep these items that isn't necessarily with the book itself, but can hold 8 1/2 x 11 sheets folded in half easily.  I used to have one of those monster size Franklin Planners which did the carrying job well - super expensive, beautiful, but a bear to carry around.  And now I don't need all that calendar business for scheduling since I use the work online calendar for work meetings (this isn't tied to the email system - how bizarre is that!)  and my home life is pretty simple with very few appointments.<br><br>I like your idea of the page notations Erika.  Especially if my notes outrun the task pages.  Definitely something I'll have to experiment with.<br></div>

<div class="content">Without even thinking about it, I started writing my autofocus list only on the right hand side of my notebook (spiral bound). This way I can fold it back on itself so it takes up less desk space. But then I've found times I need to include a little bit of info with a task. Like today I had to call and schedule a time to get my cat groomed. <br><br>I ended up putting the phone # for the groomer on the left hand page so it would be handy. I haven't had many tasks that have additional info, so it is usually pretty obvious which bits of info go with which tasks.<br><br>If I had to include more additional info, I think I would put one of those lined Post-It notes on the left hand side and then put it in my planner once I have completed the task and no longer need the info.</div>

<div class="content">In the moment, have one somewhat large spiral-bound notebook and I freely mix AF pages with others. This looks like:<br>...<br>- active AF list<br>- some scribblings, concerning a letter I intend to write<br>- a lengthy memo from a phone call<br>- some thoughts about a project, plus some phone numbers I have to call<br>- the next AF list<br>- notes for a travel I have to organize (hotels, train times etc.)<br>- conceptual notes for a new novel<br>- an idea for a novel or story (probably a bad one, but I write them all down...)<br>- another AF list<br>...<br><br>I am accustomed since years to start every subject on a new page, so I can tear them out and file them together (for example, all novel ideas go in one place, all scribblings for one novel in another, etc.). Every page gets the date in the upper left corner and the subject in the upper right, so I can always file them properly, and over twenty years' time, an impressive system of notes has grown this way which is invaluable for me.<br><br>Yes, one has to turn more pages this way. But so what? On the other hand, one is less tempted to jump around in the different AF pages; the basic rule that every page has to be considered  as a unity is supported: the others are simply out of sight!<br><br>So, maybe I'll stick with this.<br><br>Do I need tagging? No. Actually, I know whether I have made notes for a project or not. I do, however, add a tag to indicate where I store a document that is concerned (a letter to answer, for example).<br></div>

<div class="content">I think I have more tagging now than I would in normal circumstances because I'm new at this job and often when I see a task, I can't recall what it was about, or what someone asked me to do.  Also because I'm in a University environment now, and there are a massive number of committees etc. all with acronyms.  Many people here have also been here for a looooong time, so they appear to talk in some type of code that further confuses me.  Also, their systems are not like a business environment (because they've never had to be efficient?), so there are many inconsistencies and multiple steps to getting a simple task completed which you would never see outside of this academic bubble.  I need to be able to be in a meeting and write a task down and then put a bunch of notes somewhere on how to get it done.  Who to talk to, forms to fill out - then go back to my desk and try to put the steps onto my AF list.<br><br></div>
