<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2010-05-2 5:31</div>
<div class="content">Mark, I wonder if you might be willing to set up a poll that would gauge the use of the current systems, just to see what everyone is using?  It would be an interesting experiment, and I'm not sure that just number of threads with questions about systems alone provides a solid answer.</div>

<div class="content">David Drake started a poll some time ago just using the forum: <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1013508" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1013508</a><br><br>To make things more comfortable and spare Mark the trouble, we could just use one of the many free online survey tools out there. For example, I just created this one: <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/GHX27HY" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/GHX27HY</a></div>

<div class="content">Andreas, I wish you had some kind of selection of "follow principles of multiple systems, but not the letter" - because I kind of do a form of DIT / AF1 / DWM - but on a weekly basis though.  <br><br>It gives me a little more breathing room to have more time for consideration if this is something I should be doing.  I write in pencil so that I can just erase as I only have 30ish lines on my moleskine weekly daytimer.  It also keeps the list short (due to chunking / grouping tasks vs. listing every little thing) as I have this overwhelm problem if I have a big list.<br><br>I also don't operate it as a "will do" but dismiss a la AF1.  Also don't cross it off and rewrite if I work on one of the projects a little bit during the week but don't finish it, but leave it on and just put a check mark beside it if I touched it that week.  No checkmark, no carry forward.  (Well, most of the time.) ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Jaqueline:<br><br>For that purpose I allowed multiple choices on the first question, so you can check DIT, AF1 and DWM. And then on question 3 select "I made some adjustments" (optionally describing them briefly). That should capture it, shouldn't it?</div>

<div class="content">Interesting the diminishing numbers in question 4, and the contrast with question 1's results.  Almost everybody tried AF1, AF2, but few still use those.  Only 66% tried DWM, but 51% are still using it. Which means 75% of the people who tried DWM consider it the most effective (or else are simply being sheep following the latest trend :-) but 35% of the audience never even tried it.</div>

<div class="content">Alan:<br><br>Good points. And they probably indicate that it's not a good idea to judge a method until you've tried it. I'm also interested that the proportion of people who use paper and pen only is much greater than the total of the other two choices.<br><br>The results of the test also don't seem to me to reflect the same preferences as the posts on this forum, which gave me at least the impression that the majority had tried DWM and didn't like it much, except in its electronic form. I have no intention of going back and counting past posts to see if my impression was correct!</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br>Yes, the results are very interesting, with most people using DWM, and rarely posting on the forum, which suggests they are contented. For myself, I find using software makes all the difference, but obviously most people are getting by well enough with paper.<br><br>I experimented for a little while with scanning till a task stands out, and then scanning further till one stands out more. This seemed to select tasks better, but it made the system feel more complex, so I went back to the original way, which feels better.</div>

<div class="content">Alan,<br><br>i thought I'd delurk to make one personal observation about my experience with question 4.  At least in my case, when I read the question, I mistakenly answered no because I currently use DWM and the wording said "in the past."  Once I submitted with a fast-twitch mouse click, it was too late to go back and change my answer.  So I'm one of the 35 percent who seems not to have used DWM.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim,<br><br>Very useful way to look at it.  I wonder if there is a away to factor in how long the systems have been around.  IOW, the number for DWM is less impressive to me because it is very new and people have not had enough time for frustration to build.<br><br>Another factor is that some of us have switched BACK to a  previous system.  I'm not sure how you'd express that.<br><br>Finally, it might be interesting to Mark to know how many people have dropped ALL of his systems ... probably a small number, but there are some.</div>

<div class="content">Also, DWM is the latest, and I think people use that because "it's new, so it must be better", and at some level most of these systems work it's just a question of persistence and community support.</div>

<div class="meta">2010-05-8 13:34</div>
<div class="content">Another way to look at it: <br><br>DIT and DWM, both diary-based, could be regarded as more structured approaches than AF 1-4, which in turn are simple list-based systems. <br>Based on the latest numbers (May 4), here are the "retention rates" for DIT and DWM on one side and all AFs combined on the other: <br><br>DIT/DWM: 45.3% (38 out of 64)<br>AF 1-4: 14.4% (28 out of 195)<br><br>This seems to show a strong preference for a more structured approach by many people, which is somewhat in contrast with many posts in the forum, where there seems to be a preference for AF1/4.<br><br>OTOH, the validity of this conclusion is questionable, as anyone who didn't stick to DIT, and went through all systems, has been through all of the AFs and arrived at DWM for the moment. So constant switchers will dilute the AF numbers, and strengthen those for DWM. <br>In addition, the May 4 numbers show that the majority *has* been through all of the AFs. <br>Regarding DIT: Given that DIT has been around the longest and wasn't made available on this website only, but also distributed by the book, it should be the system that has been tried by many more people than the others. Most DIT users, whether satisfied with the system and still using it or not, will not have taken the poll. Most will not even know it. Someone who tried DIT a long time ago and abandoned it, might not be visiting this website anymore. <br><br>So this "retention rate" thing is probably moot. <br><br>BTW: It would be nice if the additional comments (personal tweaks etc.) from the poll could be made available als well.<br><br>Just my 2p, and now back to re-starting DWM...</div>
