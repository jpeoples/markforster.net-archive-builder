<div class="content">For all you Evernote users, I thought you'd be interested in this interview about all the innovative business practices they employ at Evernote.  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/08/business/phil-libin-of-evernote-on-its-unusual-corporate-culture.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/08/business/phil-libin-of-evernote-on-its-unusual-corporate-culture.html</a><br><br>I wasn't really "taken" by any particular innovation they mentioned, but rather by the fact that they are really questioning and innovating and coming up with solutions that work for them.   And we can all apply that idea to our own situations!   :-)</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for this, Seraphim.<br><br>I'm old in years and fashion and also like to learn via books/Kindle, especially for IT-related stuff.<br><br>Evernote for Dummies has just been released, author seems of same vintage as moi, and Mark.<br><br>While I look forward to Mark's FV book, I still rate this Forum as a treasure trove of ideas.</div>
