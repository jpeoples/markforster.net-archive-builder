<div class="content">I've found myself using AF1, AF4, DWM, and SAF in multiple combined fashions, applied as techniques for managing certain areas of my life and work, but not using any one of them as an overarching system. <br><br>It has been very effective.<br><br>For my overarching system, I use Gerry's 80/20 rule:  write down everything in one place, and keep a file system using some kind of simple organization.   Those two items account for about 80% of total TM success.   At least that's what Gerry says, and I think he makes a pretty strong case.   <br><br>Sometimes I process my main list with SAF rules, sometimes with AF1 rules, sometimes with no rules at all except the "write it all down in one place" rule.   Whatever seems needed at the time.<br><br><br>And then I use AF and DWM lists for managing all kinds of categories of things:<br><br>- DWM list for managing project tasks of different kinds<br><br>- DWM list for managing miscellaneous email reading<br><br>- AF method (slightly modified) for managing books on my shelves that I want to read<br><br>- Standing out, dismissal, "just do something", etc. -- using these principles all the time<br><br><br>Anyone else doing something like this?</div>

<div class="content">I certainly see that AF variants can be used as interchangable systems, but I'm more inclined to follow one system (while being flexible with the details) rather than switch often.  I like the discipline imposed by the system as it restrains my tendencies to get lost in the thickets.  Switching up the rules would ruin that structure.<br><br>I am attempting to apply AF techniques to household stuff.  I've succeeded with clothing and frozen foods, but other things not so much.</div>

<div class="content">My new rules for SuperFocus have so far given me 100% of TM success (though remember a lot of life isn't about TM!)<br><br>I'll be posting them in the near future - just as soon as I can get round to it.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim, I too tend to jump about a bit between systems, depending on my circumstances, and I agree that having one place to write things down is a godsend.  At the moment I'm using AF4R along with 3T.  The three tasks come from the AF4R list or are things that I need to do, or want to do, immediately.  The things I need, or want, to do are more than likely somewhere on the AF4R list already, but they've stood out intuitively as needing to be done now.  It's working quite well.<br><br>Mark, I'm looking forward to hearing about your new system, and thanks so much for keeping experimenting - we're spoiled for choice!</div>

<div class="content">My method is based on DIT, AF and DWM combined.<br><br>The core of my daily system is a datebook with planned tasks, like DIT before Mark suggested we not write tasks too far in advance. It includes tasks that are repeated, tasks that are one-time-only, and steps in bigger projects that have deadlines. When I finish a task that is to be repeated, I write it on the next due date. I plan projects backwards from the deadline and include a good deal of extra time. As I check off each step, I confirm that the next step is planned.<br><br>Every time I work a list, I use the AF method of looking through it and accepting that something will jump out at me. If nothing jumps out, I do the first on the list.<br><br>If I'm up to date, I treat today's list and the days around it together as one list, picking the task that jumps out. I might also go to my someday/maybe list, which I treat as an AF1 list.<br><br>If I'm behind, I start the day by reviewing all outstanding tasks and making a list of things that should be done in the next few days, then cycle through that list doing things as they jump out. Since I've already said everything on that list must be done in the next few days, I stay on that list until it's done.<br><br>Then I go to the oldest day with unfinished tasks. I cycle through that list until it's done, and celebrate when I cross of the day. I tried treating the book like an AF1 list, with each day being one page, but found that finishing one day at a time worked better.<br><br>If a task is blocking me and causing me to procrastinate, or I realize it should wait until I catch up, I move it to a new date. When I write it on the new date, I include a note of the old date. When I reach the new date I see how long the task has been on the list. Then I apply DWM, but with a bit of flexibility about the date. If I've had a truly busy month, I let it go a bit longer. Eventually, though, I have to think carefully about why I want to do it and why it's not getting done.<br><br><br><br><br>Then I go to the oldest day with unfinished tasks and pick tasks as in AF1, except I don't get to move off that page before it's done without good reason.<br><br>I let myself carry tasks forward only if I realize the task is blocking me. Sometimes I will do anything but the task in question.</div>
