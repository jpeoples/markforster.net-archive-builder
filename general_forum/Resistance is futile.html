<div class="content">I'm struck by how little time things take when you do them, even if they have long been resisted.<br><br>I've had "Clear bottom shelf" on my list since the AF beta test began.  And it's something I've been meaning to do for a couple of years, but never steeled myself to do.  Did it this morning and it took four minutes.</div>

<div class="content">I actually think using AF is changing my perceptions when it comes to these types of tasks. I find myself just doing things I would've put off before. I'll just be in the right place at the right time, and I'll think, "I bet this will only take 5 or 10 minutes. Even if it doesn't, I can quite whenever I want." A lot of the little things that used to be nagging at me are out of the way now. <br></div>

<div class="content">The late Thomas Leonard wrote a book called "The Portable Coach".  In it he introduced the idea of "tolerations".  His idea (which I have personally verified) was that things that you tolerate in your life drain your energy and removing them gives you a boost in energy.  He also put it: "Incompletions drain energy; completions generate energy" ... or words to that effect.<br><br>He recommended that you take some time to write a list of everything in your life that you are tolerating: squeaky hinge, dripping faucet, cracked windshield, obnoxious boss, etc.   Then, with that long list in hand, you start to solve those things one at a time, as best you can.  It would work marvelously with AF!  Just add a few of those to each page as you go and see what happens.<br><br>It is a great idea, and it really does work.<br><br>He used to have a website with lots of freely available stuff but that went with his death ...now it is all pay for stuff.  But for that exercise he invited people to submit their lists.  Some of the things people put on where what you might expect ... and many people had the same tolerations.  But there were some pretty funny ones.  One that sticks in my mind was: "I must find a way to stop the rattlesnakes from crawling across the living room floor."</div>

<div class="content">The incompletions comment is absolutely true - and I've been aware of it for a long time; but just addressed it ad hoc.<br><br>With this prompt, I'm adding a new list (open or closed set of AF style lists? - yet to decide) of incompletions to the prog I use to run AF, and will try to make sure that I regularly take tasks from this list into the AF working lists. Some of the incompletions are minor and others are massive projects; sometimes I will just add small tasks from a massive project, but sometimes I will add a whole project if I determine that I really want to get that one done.<br><br>One aspect of these tolerated incompletions is that, by definition, they don't have to be done and are therefore never urgent: so the temptation is not to address them unless there is plenty of time available. The alternative temptation is to stick the lot into AF - but their lack of urgency may well lead to eventual dismissal and a continued drain. I'm hoping that a separate list and fairly regular moving of tasks on to AF will give a sense of things moving on them all and none of the incompletions being lost.</div>

<div class="content">You are very right about the low urgency.  I'm quite sure that if you added hundreds of them to the AF list disaster would befall you ;-)  However, I think that if you put maybe1/2 dozen or so on the list every week or so, the low urgency would not be a problem, nor would the overwhelm.<br><br>The way I see it, if it is on the list with other things that are being seriously considered, the low urgency toleration would be seriously considered as well.  I suspect that we don't fix the leaking faucet because we never think about it until we turn it on.  However, if it is on the AF list and seen many times, we might just grab a wrench and fix it.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for those observations Mike.  Mind you, I wish I'd had an AF list some years ago - the concept of dismissing "obnoxious boss" could have had appeal!</div>
