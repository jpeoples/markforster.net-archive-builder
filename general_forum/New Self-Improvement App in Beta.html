<div class="content">Hi,<br><br>After reading a lot of materials on self improvement I found that it is hard to convert the knowledge in the books to daily real life improvement.<br>Basically all I need is few daily actions that I can do every day that help me to improve in desired areas.<br><br>To achieve this I build small mobile app that provides daily actions based on the areas I've selected.<br>The app is in Beta and can be downloaded from Google Play using this link:<br>https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.MyDreams.MyDreams<br><br>Would be great to hear your feedback as people here are also working on improving themselves.<br><br>Any feedback is welcome.<br>Alexander.</div>
