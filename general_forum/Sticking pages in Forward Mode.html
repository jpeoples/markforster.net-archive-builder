<div class="content">This was mentioned in several posts in the last time: One enters Forward Mode, but arrives soon at always the same page where nothing stands out... so one goes back to Reverse Mode... and the pages in the middle of the list remain untouched for a long time.<br><br>I suggest a simple addition to the rule: If you get to a certain page in Forward Mode where nothing stands out FOR THE SECOND TIME IN A ROW, don't switch back to Reverse Mode, but dismiss the page instead and go on to the next page (as in classical AF1).<br><br>Works great!</div>

<div class="content">I guess that could be an issue when you have a lot of pages but it seems that RAF does not give the same build up of pages.  I would find that frequently when I had 60 active pages but found that I was able to clear pages both sides of those "stuck pages" which made reaching that page from either direction a lot quicker.  I decided to just follow the rules and currently am working on one of those stuck pages thanks to my "line of doom".  This page had 8 items in 5 blocks - it may well me another three days to clear it (or I may just find I do them quicker) but the fact is that I now have only 27 active pages and 70 items so I can work through the list several times a day anyway.</div>

<div class="content">I'd say how many pages build up depends more on the given situation (hectic vs. calm) and the kind of tasks that occur (few but big vs. many but tiny) than on the method applied. I definitely observe "waves" in the number of tasks that add on per day.<br><br>The typical "sticky page" (or "wall page"?) contains only a few tasks left that would get dismissed anyway if that page happened to be the first active.<br><br>BTW, I always found the dismissing rule of AF1 a very strong motivation to attack a page despite my resistance. So, maybe that's the reason this works great for me.</div>

<div class="content">Andreas,<br><br>Why not just apply the AF1 rule as it original was?  Dismiss ANY page you don't find moved to tackle.  It is a simpler rule.  Any rule that does not require keeping cont of things is more automatic and makes the list itself less intrusive.  The worst that could happen is that you wind up adding things back to the list later ... then they go on the end where things churn quicker.  Lots of advantages to making short work in forward mode.  By operation of rule, the early pages (forward mode) consist of items that have been passed over many times before.  Maybe it is time they took a "time out"?  ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Mike,<br><br>yes, I thought about that, too, and maybe will adopt that, but in the moment I am trying to follow RAF as closely as possible, and most probably there is a reason why the "page where nothing stands out" (PWNSO) is the signal to switch back to Reverse Mode. Maybe I'll find out what reason...<br><br>The alternative would be to go back to my REVERSE AF tweak. RAF is basically AF2 with little periods of AF1, while REV AF is AF1 with little periods of AF2... ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Andreas<br><br>I think Mark has said somewhere that dismissing early counts as action anyway so if you know already that you are not going to do them then you can action them by transferring to your "review" list.  My situation was a little different in that I will do the tasks but don't really want to - the "line of doom" seems to provide the motivation I need that I can look at a task above the line and think "pah, what was so scary about YOU!"<br><br>After my current "stuck page" of 8 items i have 4 closed pages followed by another stuck page of 3 items followed by 6 more closed pages so I will be zipping through shortly :-)</div>
