<div class="content">I have greatly underestimated importance of routines in time management. It was not until recently when i realized that routines are great savers of time, energy and attention. Routine helps to complete many (less-or-more important, well...routine) tasks and frees our attention and energy for creative projects. I always understood routines as something boring what will drain energy and spontaneity from live, but now I can see the opposite is true - it is like having all the safety and assistance systems in your car fully functional: you can concentrate on what is important in your ride and still enjoy the scenery along the way...<br><br>My general view of routines:<br>	- they should associate similar types of activities<br>	- they are not necessarily only repeating tasks (see bellow)<br><br>The main advantage is that I do not have to think about many tasks during the day - yes, because they go to routine lists (mental lists or real lists, which I keep for each of my routines) and I will focus on them - when the time of routine comes.<br><br>Examples of my routines:<br><br>Morning and evening routine: here go e.g. all "body and health" maintenance activities: shaving, skin care, taking vitamins, yoga exercise). Before, I was unsure (did I take a medicine?) and reproaching myself: why I always forget to exercise...<br><br>Weekly routines: one (or more) for each weekday: e.g. Tuesday - errands (outside), Wednesday - home chores and repair, Thursday - emails (clearing, filing, replying on those low important), Friday - computer maintenance (backing-up, updating, deleting unused files...), Saturday - laundry, Sunday - clean-up (physical, mental). <br><br>I do not feel obliged to spend exact time or to do the same tasks on these routines. Sometimes I do only one small think (e.g. delete two emails), sometimes nothing (e.g. I just check that there are not any important errands, there is not enough laundry to wash etc.), and sometimes I do many tasks in that area. But the main think is: when I feel I am done, I know that I am done for whole week (before next occurrence of this routine/theme comes). <br><br>Similarly, I have month routines (13th - banking day, 30th - monthly review etc)<br><br>And the punchline? I have much more focus for my important projects and feeling less distracted, less resistant and less overwhelmed.</div>

<div class="content">Barrack Obama believes that reducing the number of unimportant decisions each day gives him more energy to focus on the important decisions. He wears the same colour shirt, eats the same breakfast and lunch. It's worked for him.<br><br>Routines are about making the decision once (or maybe a few times), and then sticking with it until your consciousness gets out of the way. Once they're established, there's anxiety if you don't follow them. That's intentionally creating anxiety as a tool to help get things done.<br><br>As for not exactly the same each time? FlyLady supports "checking, and doing if necessary" as the routine, rather than "doing." I like "Work in the area for 15 minutes, even if the predictable stuff only takes 5." Many non-routine things get done!<br><br>I tend to build routines that don't work, and then try to reboot the same routine rather than try something else. Once March Break is over, I might move my exercise to the afternoon, which is normally a low-energy time. I can work on my podcast-listening backlog then, something I usually feel guilty about. In the past, I tried to do it first thing in the morning, but it would leave me too tired to do anything else useful.<br><br>I find weekly and monthly routines hard to maintain. Groceries after voice lesson is easy, but there are always appointments or something that break the weekly routine.I'm going to try "first half-day with no appointments" rather than "Monday morning".</div>

<div class="content">I love routines! One of the most important aspects for me, that wasn't mentioned here, is that routines are stress reducers. They can give you some peace of mind.<br><br>I once read in one of these Richard Carlsson's "Don't Sweat..." books the recommendation to become *less* stress resistant. I don't like stress anyway, it makes me less effective. So I try to eliminate potential stress by making certain things into routines/habits.<br><br>In a sense, systematically applying FV at work is also a stress-reducing routine ;)</div>
