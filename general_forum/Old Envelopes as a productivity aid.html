<div class="content">I've been trying an adaptation of 'pure' AF for a while and it seems to be bearing fruit for me...  it also happens to be more environmentally friendly than methods I've used in the past.<br><br>I keep a full list a la AF in a normal notebook and process it according to normal AF rules.<br><br>The only divergence from AF is that every day I take an old envelope - from junk mail, letters, bills, whatever -  from the pile that I keep in a drawer and write a list of the things that I need to do on that day. I try to keep the list short - just the stuff that I really want / need to get done that day, and one or two additional entries - Process AF list  and  Drain Email.   If I have time-bound things to do like meetings or customer visits,  I sketch a little timeline somewhere on the envelope.<br><br>Then, in the standard AF way,  I do the things that feel right.  If that means doing things in bursts, that works too.  If I feel the need to do something else, then I have the escape of the 'process AF' entry.<br><br>If additional work shows its head,  then I write it (per AF) onto the end of my AF list. Or if its 'today urgent', I add it to the envelope.<br><br>So far,  it seems to be working well.  Most days I have the satisfaction of ending the day with a completely crossed-out list,  telling my subconscious that its OK to finish the day's work and not secretly worry that I should be doing 'one more thing'.  <br><br>I think that the reason it works is precisely because I'm using the backs of scrappy old reused envelopes that don't feel like they are part of a 'system' or a 'process', so I'm not tempted to get sucked into thinking about the means rather than the end.<br><br>Also,  having a list that is clearly limited to the things that it is feasible to finish in a day removed the feeling of Overwhelm.    Ironically,  it puts a nice envelope around the day's work  :-)</div>

<div class="content">I like this idea.  I have a day per page diary in my filofax which seems a bit redundant with AF (and I use outlook for appointments) - this would be a good use of this page and would give me a record of what I have achieved.</div>

<div class="content">Sounds like what I started doing a couple days ago at work, writing the important things on a white board.  Whiteboard stuff is very temporary.  But I strayed a bit by writing too many things on the board.  I should hold myself to what's already written and put the rest in AF so I can actually finish the board.</div>

<div class="content">Dave: just wondering if you've had days when you had tasks in the envelope that you are not able to complete. Do you transfer them to the AF list? <br><br>I see how it works for you, having a focus list as it were. For me, the list I work out of is important and subsidiary lists are a distraction.</div>

<div class="content">Hi JD.<br><br>Depends on what it is.    I review the list at the end of the day or first thing on the next day. Sometimes,  something left undone on the list tells me that it should be dismissed straight away.  Sometimes, I realise that although it needs to be done,  its not 'day specific' so it goes back onto the AF list.  Or sometimes,  I just put it on the next day's envelope.<br><br>However,  I try not to be too hung up on it,  precisely for the non-distraction reasons you described.  The idea of the envelope and its intentional scrappiness is that it is disposable.  Nothing gets lost,  because its always on AF.   The envelope is just a little pragmatically restricted window onto the AF list.</div>

<div class="content">Alan B:   Precisely.  Using a whiteboard, envelope, etc is only going to be help if it limits what you see to something that is non threatening to your 'Reactive' side, so that your 'Rational' side can get on with things,  to use Mark F's terms.    The envelope is just a variation of a Closed List.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Alison,  I like the idea of reusing stuff like that.  I've tried doing something like that in the past (probably the guilt I felt for buying a lovely Moleskine page per day diary and not using it...).<br><br>For me,  I had trouble keeping it going because something nice and sparkly and shiny like that seemed too much like a 'system' and I had trouble disconnecting it from the need to keep it disposable.  Maybe tearing the pages out of the book would have worked...<br><br>After re-reading that,  I realise that I'm lucky I don't feel the need to wash my hands every 3 minutes...</div>

<div class="content">Dave, this is a lot like how I did Autofocus condensed in the past.  I did find most of the time that I could keep focused on my condensed list for about 1/2 a day, but when my attention flagged,  was compelled to go work on the "master AF list".  It was like clockwork.  I intentionally put more on the list than I thought I would do to give more variety, but your method sounds a bit better.<br>Oh, and at work, I always write my daily lists - if I have them - on the back of old envelopes, a big post it note or a piece of scrap paper.</div>

<div class="content">Dave and Others: nice thread and posts, it's little tweaks like this that are so interesting and valuable if one can apply them.<br><br>I like the idea of just doing it for today's closed list, one can add tasks not listed 'below the line' or on the back. Good use of redundant paper.  I guess those that use 3 x 5 cards for the closed list could use your idea.<br><br>Small and big businesses have often resorted to small techniques for saving money.  To this day, I still put draft printed documents etc to one side (if not confidentail) and use them as notepaper or sketching ideas.  Some are torn into A5 size which I may use to write a note clipped to the front of relevant documents.<br><br>In the 1970s I .worked for a company that had almost gone under a couple of years earlier.  They retained all incoming post envelopes and used them for internal mail, no email in those days.</div>

<div class="content">I too work from a daily/focus list, in the form of an sheet of A4 paper folded twice to give 6 sides for 6 or 7 days.<br><br>Using a sheet for the whole week, it can also serve as a weekly calendar/tickler.<br><br>A while ago I used envelopes for everything, and when one was filled up I just started another...</div>

<div class="content">I take a break and see what happens? Too much to grouch about, but to be a "helpful" citizen.<br><br>Smileypete,<br><br>Have you seen the following?<br><br><a href="http://repocketmod.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://repocketmod.com/</a><br><br>I use a few of these for infos I need to keep with me from time to time (formulas) and as combo satellite AF list.</div>
