<div class="content">I was going to hold off on doing this post for a while yet but I just realized that today is my AFiversary, so what the heck.<br><br>DWM is growing on me.  It was definitely NOT love at first sight like AF4 was (<a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/900207)." rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/900207).</a>  Like many people, in the first day I had concerns about how to work the system, toyed with putting items due in less than a week or a month on their hard due dates (SorryMarkSorrysorrysorry).  Predictably, I came 'round to doing it the "right way" - just like with every other tweak I've ever tried of one of Mark's systems.  (Actually, that's not quite true... I did consistently not dates of line-drawing, dismissal, and # of items reviewed in AF4.)  It's definitely NOT been love at first sight the way AF4 was, and I have some concerns about what will happen with weekends when I often have an hour, tops, to work on my combined work/home list.  For the moment, though, I'm three days "ahead" (that is to say, no open tasks before 2/14 with only 2 expiring on 2/15 and 2/16 being completely done) and moving forward on a wide variety of things all at once, which I like.<br><br>As I mentioned elsewhere (<a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1012130" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1012130</a> ), initially the "going backwards to re-enter a task" element took a little while to get used to.  This had nothing to do with the dates element, but just with the physical act of turning pages BACKWARDS to re-enter something.  I've mostly gotten over it at this point, and just feel for the paperclip that i know to be at the top of the page and run with it.<br><br>I don't know if I'll stay with DWM long-term, but I'll give it a go for at least a month and then see how I'm feeling about it.<br><br>My poor AF notebook that I've been using since the beginning is on its last legs - even the duck tape that's been holding it together is failing, and there are only five empty pages left.  I think I'm going to celebrate my AF-iversary by starting a new book. This one has had a good run.</div>

<div class="content">+1 (to smileypete)<br><br>I fail to understand thia as well. If the task has a 'hard' due date, it's going to expire on that date. Period. After all, the auto-dismissal function of DWM *is* calendar-based. Whether you can afford letting it expire is another matter, entirely.<br><br>In addition, I do not see any reason to push a task with a 'hard' due date back beyond its true due date (cf. the week-rule thingy for tasks you did some work on). Again, this refers to the calendar-based 'expiry date'.<br><br>OTOH, I understand how entering new tasks *before* their 'true' due date (for tasks whose 'hard' due date is more than one month away) may be benficial.</div>

<div class="content">Alex,<br>Mark has addressed this a couple of times.  Here is how he answered my almost identical issue:<br><br>"Marty H:<br><br><< The one about something with a due date less than 30 days out seems easy: Add it on the last day it can be done. Include the due date in brackets which is what I do now in AF4 like this: [17 Feb]. If the date you originally write something (one month from today) is the expiration date, this just seems logical to me. I don't really understand why Mark is against this. >><br><br>Because:<br><br>1) It was one of the things I tried out when I was developing the system, and it didn't work at all well. Mainly I think because it destroyed the closed list aspect of the system, and therefore much of its effect.<br><br>2) The idea is to test out the system and THEN suggest changes, not to invent something different and test that out. If you haven't tested the system as written your comments are going to be useless to me.

<div class="content">A more detailed explanation: Only the next 7 days are really the issue.  Following Mark's rule, everything between now and 5 days hence are tasks you've been ignoring. Tasks on the sixth day are largely those you worked on recently.  The closed list effect is to show you what you've been avoiding. Writing tasks on the due date masks that.<br><br>(just something I'm figuring out today)</div>

<div class="content">'The closed list effect is to show you what you've been avoiding.

<div class="content">MartyH has given several of the reasons, but another one is that if you need to re-date pages - which happens if you are away from the list for one or more working days - then your "hard dates" will all be on the wrong pages.<br><br>My advice with hard deadlines is to put them in brackets after the task:<br><br>e.g. "Ring Bob [Feb 24]", or "Report on London Branch [by Mar 1]"</div>

<div class="content">If you keep up w/ stuff, the closing date and the date it's writ on can't be too far behind; only a few days.</div>

<div class="content">＞Maybe a good alternative would be to write DWM on the left side of the page and 'hard' calendar due dates on the right side (or vice versa).<br><br>I do this with google Calendar. <br>My main calendar is for DWM(and I just put three dashes "---" before finished items so I can see how many times I rewrote stuff like on paper)<br>and I have another calendar for meetings etc (which I may also use as a tickler)</div>

<div class="content">Sorry I made a mistake. My second calendar is not for hard dates but for using as a real calendar for meetings. I misread the point sorry ^^;<br>I am putting hard dates into brackets in DWM.</div>

<div class="content">I think it would mess me up to use my DWM notebook as my "hard date" calendar.  I use google calendar for that stuff and my notebook strictly for my DWM list.  I put due dates in parenthesis for things that will come due before the DWM moth or week is up, but so far I've gotten everything done on time without really worrying about that. I've tried electronic options for AF, etc, but there's nothing in the world as satisfying (in terms of these organizational systems) as crossing out a task with a pen on paper.</div>

<div class="content">I just realized that I'm currently illustrating ANOTHER (more positive) reason not to put hard deadline items on their 'dated' page: it can INCREASE the number of pages you have to flip.<br><br>I have a research proposal due tomorrow (the 13th) that has been circling 'round my list for about a week.  But currently my first day with open tasks is the 14th.  So if I had just kept re-entering the proposal on the thirteenth, that would be ONE WHOLE EXTRA PAGE that I had to flip.  I'm being flip here (and punny, apparently) but it does make a difference.  <br><br>Possibly relatedly - I really find that the vast majority of the action (in terms of actual doing, not just in terms of item entry) in this system happens on today+7 and today +28-30.  Possibly this is a function of my type of work / how I operate, but it's interesting nonetheless.</div>

I think some of tomorrow’s home tasks will expire quietly because they’re “do X after ABC happens” type tasks, and ABC hasn’t happened yet. I’m not going to re-enter the tasks until I know ABC is done, although I’ll include a “check if ABC is done” followup task. <br><br>>>Like many people, in the first day I had concerns about how to work the system, toyed with putting items due in less than a week or a month on their hard due dates<br><br>I did too, but I tried it as Mark described – even though in one case the ‘today+30’ was at least 2 weeks after the hard due date. Everything so far has gotten done in time of their real due dates, and without realizing it, I did all the work items that were due on Monday (a US holiday) without consciously trying to. A couple of days ago I realized Monday was a holiday and wanted to see which would work better – rescheduling the due date now, or re-date it later as Mark described. I checked my open list for Monday but I had nothing due, that surprised me so  I double checked my closed list and there were about a dozen items that got closed out earlier. <br><br>>> DWM is growing on me<br><br>I’m liking DWM a lot – it’s easier to look at a list with future dates  and think “Ok, I can work on XYZ and get ahead” instead of looking at the list with past dates and think “well, XYZ has been waiting for 4 days already, another day won’t matter” Even though both lists have the same items, and even though in both cases XYZ has been on the list for 4 days, the DWM perspectives feels more positive to me. <br><br>Alex and SmileyPete –<br><br>>> I fail to understand this as well. If the task has a 'hard' due date, it's going to expire on that date. Period. … In addition, I do not see any reason to push a task with a 'hard' due date back beyond its true due date<br><br>Don’t forget that the DWM due date is not the start date. If you have an item due Feb 25, what’s the difference between writing it on the Feb 25 page vs. the March 5 page? You still have to work on it before Feb 25 (unless it’s something that can ONLY be done on Feb 25, in which case, it probably should be a calendar appointment instead). When you work on it today, you’ll cross it off the March 5 page and continue it on the Feb 19 page (BEFORE the Feb 25 due date BTW :) ) <br><br>I’ve been putting tasks on my lists (home & work) according to Mark’s +30 and +7 (ok, I use +28 at work instead, but that’s the only time tweak I’ve done) for items that have a hard due date of anywhere from now+15minutes (definitely before the +30 date :) ) to a date after the DWM expire date.  I’ve met all the hard dates in the 2 weeks. At work, the list is on Excel and I have the hard date in parentheses and in colored text as part of the task description. At home, the list is on paper and there too I write the date as part of the task.</div>
