<div class="content">Hi all, just delurking to see if anyone else is using autofocus to get their exercise in?  In the past, it's worked well for me to do my exercise first thing in the morning, but that hasn't been working so well for the last couple of years.  And since I don't *feel* like it when I come home, that's never worked for me.   Over the last couple of days though, I've experimented with entering exercise items on my list - eg. "bench press" - and that does seem to be working for me.  It's not something that has to be done on a particular day/time or a particular number of reps (although that is ideal, it just wasn't getting done).   It also allows me to do as much or as little as I feel like doing - if I only feel like doing 10 reps of squats, that's all that I do just to get it off the list.  <br>I've got my $1000 treadmill (a golden retriever), so aerobic exercise (walking / running / biking) is never something that I miss.  But the resistance training was falling by the wayside.  <br>As a side note, I see that you look very healthy and slim in your video Mark, and was wondering if that was a result of tweaking the "no S diet" ?  Whatever you're doing, it must have worked for you.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline, I am starting on AF tomorrow and will incorporate my training into it. I am  mixing weights with road running and cycling but find that when I have the time I'm not motivated and when i'm motivated I dont have time! So I think I will train at all different times of day but at least I'm doing it. I will post how its gone.</div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline,<br><br>I also noticed and thought the same: is Mark1s appearance the result of "no s diet"?<br></div>
