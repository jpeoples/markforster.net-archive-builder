<div class="meta">2009-05-7 12:45</div>
<div class="content">One of the features I like in DIT is the "current initiative", which allows to kick-start a project or clean up some backlog. It consists in working on this CI for some time FIRST thing every day.<br><br>I was wondering if this can be combined with AF. I don't really see a reason why not. Did anyone here already try this and care to share their experience or thoughts on the matter?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Marc<br>I don't do AF except as a timeblock for  the unscheduled or non-routine stuff, I don't qualify as an AF expert.  But, since the current initiative is a daily habit, it needn't be on the list at all except, perhaps, it can be put on the list when it's time to think about choosing a new one.  Otherwise, it's a dyed-in-the-wool daily habit and Mark states that hardened habits aren't candidates for the AF list<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>My logic is that the AF list is to manage tasks during discretionary time.  Engrained habits are ritualized and, therefore, not done in discretionary time.  What you choose to be the current initiative is, on the other hand, entirely discretionary!  LOL!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Glad to see you back l.a.i.g. !<br><br>Marc, I do have a current initiative (first thing before even grabbing coffee) at work to clean up my email backlog whenever one arises.  I wouldn't hesitate to use it for other things, however not much else has arisen that I really want to work on systematically every day.</div>

<div class="content">Hey, Jacqueline!<br>Thanks!  Although I can't contribute much to the AF dialog, I truly enjoy coming here to be enriched with the dialogs generated here!   I especially enjoy reading your posts because I love the way you think!  Also, I'm so very excited for your amazing progress and life journey in general.  I feel like a harmless voyeur!  *blush*<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for your replies.<br><br>I have an additional question. Working on the current initiative may generate actions on your AF list, and it may also make progress on things that are already on the list (while you're not "on the list" during the CI time). I wonder how this interaction can be handled?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Marc,<br><br>I do still use the current initiative approach in my working with AF.  And I do end up with new tasks and complete ones on my AF list as a result of working on an iniative.  What I do is this.  I keep a small notebook -- not my AF notebook -- but a smaller one just for this purpose -- on my desk that I use only for my initiatives work.  I add the date when I am working on the initiative and then under that, if new tasks come up as a result of this dedicated work, I add those here.  If I have completed specific tasks during my work on the initiative, then I add those here as well and indicate that they were completed.<br><br>Once done, I go through my AF lists and look to see if any of the tasks that I completed during the initiatives work are here -- if so, then I cross them off accordingly.  I then add the new tasks to the last active page of my AF lists.  <br><br>This works quite well for me and takes very little time.  An added benefit is that I have a running diary if you will of my initiatives work by date.<br><br>At any rate, I hope you find this helpful.<br><br>Marc and all others, I hope you are well  and healthy.  Best wishes!<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">David,<br><br>FWIW, I used to chase things around my AF list to cross off after I had done them in a fit of serendipity ;-)  Eventually I decided my time could be used better doing things than manicuring my list and decided that I'd just let the crossing off go until I ran across the items in the course of normal list processing.  Then I would remember that the item had been done a while ago and cross it off at that point.  Even if it has been only partially done and so was added to the end of the list, I see no problem it leaving it in place.  If that is the case, there are two opportunities to see the item and work on it again.  Eventually it will be completed and crossed off as many times as it appears on the list.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike,<br><br>To be honest....sometimes I have done it this way too.  For some reason, though, I have been more precise in reviewing my AF lists after my initiative time is over to cross out any completed tasks.  I even have this written down as instructions to myself entitled: "Performing Current Initiative Module"   <br><br>How is that for being a bit obsessive!

<div class="content">Hi David<br>No Way!  OCD is debilitating and based on illogic.  Instead, you are a scientist, professor and an adminstrator.  Conscientiousness, high standards, reliability, willingness to "ruminate" and repeat (developing and testying hyposesises (sp?) and experiments, leading highly educated and dedicated peers, etc.... IS NOT MALADAPTIVE! Instead, it's LAUDABLE! <br> I prided myself on staying the course and going beyond the ordinary standards when I was a medical illustrator.  ....and what you do is much more censequential than what I ever did!<br>.....sheepishly dismounting my soapbox....<br>learning as I so</div>

<div class="content">(((Jacqueline and David)))<br><br>I haven't experienced such a torrent of tears of gratitude and joy since the last lunar eclipse!  I used to split my life between my solitary passions and my rich social life....As much as I valued my talents and passions, I always believed that the people in my life gave it the most meaning and satisfaction.  Now weeks can go by without any interaction what-so-ever....but I don't blame anyone.  I broke the implied contract by becomming too disabled.  Luckily I find many ways to keep my existance as rich as possible.  Luckily, children really love me and my dog.  I'm like the gimpy Pied Piper of Hamilton!  LOL!  but, alas, their opinions aren't universal.  I've witnessed parents grabbing their children by arm and pulling them away from me when they scream out "Hi" and go towards me.  I assume that they surmise that I'm a drunk!  LOL!  My physical and verbal skills (or lack there of) suggest that  *blush*.<br>So I liken myself to the solitary worker who gets hyped when he'a again surrounded by his family and friends....the social feed is inoculating him against the depletions of human contact that his work requires......<br>Although I harbor little or not grudges against the people who can't tolerate being around me....either it hurts them too much to see me like this....or.....I just don't have the right stuff anymore.....who knows......<br>But, I'm hoping that my cyber life helps to fill in the gaps of my normal human needs of at least some sort of social affiliation!  ROTFL! <br>Thank you, Jacqueline and David for having eyes of compassion....that gently ignores my obvious foibles!  *blush*  I can't communicate how much I appreciate visiting you all here.<br>learning as I go<br>p.s.  I'm sorry that I'm being gushy.....but that's what happens when I feel an explosion of gratitude.  Thank you!</div>

<div class="content">Hi learning as i go<br><br>Having only dipped in and out of the forum briefly over the past couple of weeks it's a pleasure to see you back and I definitely second (third?) what Jacqueline and David have said.  Those people who ignore you are the ones who have a problem - and are the ones who are missing out.  Their loss is our gain - your contributions here are always very much welcomed - you've certainly given me a lot of great advice and encouragement :-)<br><br>A lot of us may be isolated from as much human interaction as we may have been used to, by circumstances, work commitments, time commitments etc and being able to retain contact through the internet can be a real lifeline.  And who said friends have to be made by physically meeting?!  I most definitely value the cyber friends made through this forum!</div>

<div class="content">Hi learning as i go<br><br>As an aside, it seems to me that you write very well. Have you considered writng a book? Of course I don't know whether your circumstances would make that difficult, but if you always carried on from where you left off it would help with continuity. And stream of consciousness has produced some excellent books in the past.<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark<br><br>I loved the Current Initiative concept in DIT and had a stack of Current Initiatives lined up one after the other ready to progress.  However, what I found was that priorities shifted so quickly that keeping to my Current Initiative was never easy.  If I "declared a backlog", you could guarantee that, before it had been cleared as a CI, I had a "new" backlog to add to it!<br><br>With AF I just added everything into my lists and let the system sort them out.  I tend to have areas that I perceive in the manner of a Current Initiative but find I have little need for that as a specific concept.  My email backlogs (which were a consistent problem) disappeared under AF with the exception of a really old batch of email which I had kept to extract information - that is clearing on a "little and often" basis with what feels like almost no input from me.  The closest I get to a Current Initiative these days is if I have a specific task I need to address more urgently, in which case I use my "Unicycle and Tandem" approach.<br><br>Hope that helps .....?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Marc<br>Without reitterating what I wrote on the top of the page regarding how to implement the Current Initiative and not using AF as my primary organizing tool, I'll stretch my imagination and visualize how I'd use AF to govern my faithful and regular(the operative idea) implementation of CI.  Firstly, CI is NOT discretionary!  ....but....if you insist on using a discretionary list to teach/remind yourself to keep up with CI....this is how I'd do it AF style.  <br>CI monday: 05/11 at (decided time of day you'll do it regularly.  As per Mark's suggestion, I do my CI first thing but that's not the real objective.  The real objective is to do it everyday without fail and having a regular time facilitates that.  <br>CI tuesday 05/12 at (fill in time decided on)<br>etc....<br>After I crossed off the task, I'd repeat it a la AF to the last open page with the week's following date and time frame.  <br>If you cycle the list daily, then simply modify this and insert tomorrow's dat at the end of the list.<br>Believe me, since it's the same time everyday, wouldn't it be far simpler to put it on your calendar or anchor it onto another firmly established habit sequence already instilled?<br>Mine is attached to my daily AM habit sequence.<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine<br>It sounds as if you are unnecessarily limiting the scope of possible uses of IC.  It can be used for authors to count of writing at least X amount daily: get a project off the ground: institute learning a new skill: reading X amount everyday: train your dog: etc....It's applications are practically limitless.  It's anything that you deem important enough to dedicate yourself daily to without fail.  Mark advocates using it to get urgent backlog taken care of: getting your reliable system up and running and THAN choosing from your CI queque.  My first one was backlog.  Now it's exciting to do my CI daily and it's exciting to anticipate what I'll choose next from my CI candidates list.<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Hi learning as I go<br><br>You may well be right - I certainly did not treat CI's properly but then as you know I struggle with the "must do daily" type of rule :-).<br><br>Strangely AF is actually working on those type of items in the "correct way".  By working my pages I will find that I am more than likely to be progressing one thing daily if not to completion at least to a more liveable stage.</div>

<div class="content">Hi learning as I go<br><br>Absolutely!  Mind you, I'm having an extremely frustrating time at present 'cos I am working on my "bete noir" that is blocking my peace as you and Mel so eloquently put it.  I am frustrated because I cannot work it within pure AF because it needs drastic action rather than the little and often approach and I am SO SO BORED!!!!  I keep switching back to AF for my light relief but I could do with an army of mini-me's to just come and help.<br><br>I just can't get this progressed at anything like 100% efficiency - which is what I had gotten used to with AF.  I've got my PC playing music so I won't hear those "BOO!s" but nothing much is helping.  I think maybe I need to break it down, add it all into my list and work it that way - I will then be able to see progress as I tick each little piece off - now why didn't I think of that earlier? - I even wrote a tweak to handle this scenario!!!  Obviously my brain has gone to complete mush with boredom today :-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine<br>Just a thought.....how about mini timebox launches.  If the work is boring, but you have a general idea of how to get the crap done.....rather than fussing with a bunch of writing and rearranging, why not launch a few timeboxes for the stuff you already know both what and how to do already.  I know that you're totally against cram sessions, so I won't suggest that...............although................one or two cram sessions might just be significant enough to start feeling more hopeful about it.......<br>I'm a great proponent of timeboxing.  I know when I'm on the clock, I'm intently focused and giving it a proper effort.  <br>I never quite understood folks counting quantities of tasks done.....unless the quanities are each equal in time and significance as well.  <br>Since you're championing for your peace of mind, the importance factor is covered.  If you mostly work with integrity (diligent focus and effort), then ticking off X amount of time with each timebox can be a great incentive and provide that much needed "proof" of progress that will chip away at feelings of overwhelm.  You can always alternate these dreaded modules of boring scut with other items on your AF list or whatever you choose to relieve/revive yourself from walking in the depths of abject boredom..........and lived to tell about it!  ROTFL!<br>(((Christine))).....believe me, my sympathies are with you if you're facing a mountain of boredom...especially if it engenders the Sisyphus effect!

<div class="content">Hi learning<br><br>Thanks for the words of advice - I am using a number of the tools in my toolbox - some of which are really quite silly but somehow work for me and also have my trusty egg timer to hand!  Interestingly your post made me think about timeblocks and timed bursts and I have discovered something new .......<br><br>Although timed bursts work for me to a degree, they do not work as effectively for me they appear to for others.  The times they do work is when I have a totally fixed deadline and a specific number of tasks to do in that time, for example just before going on a trip.  Then I write a list of necessary tasks, allocate them to a specific 15 min timeblock and set the timer going.  Now that works for me - I guess because I know I have to do the tasks, and the timer is more of a time tracking device in that scenario than a motivation tool.<br><br>I'm not sure how I could translate that effect to this type of task - there is no external deadline so not that degree of "have to".  I guess the reason that it doesn't work so well has something to do with my dislike of being told when to do something - it knows that the timer is an unnecessary deadline.  I need to find something that will motivate me more effectively in that scenario.<br><br>Re your comment about numbers of tasks, that counting statistic works for me regardless of size and complexity - it must be something to do with the way my mind works - and I guess has a lot to do with the way AF works.  That perhaps explains why it works better for me than timeblocks whereas the opposite is true for you.  If you think about AF it does not grade the tasks - all tasks from an AF perspective are equal - walk the dog vs rule the world.  All of my best methods of attacking a large task involve breaking it down in some way - I guess subconsciously providing the opportunity for lots of wins.<br><br>I guess if I were Sisyphus I'd break the rock up and take it up the mountain piece by piece - a lot less effort and I could enjoy the view!<br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine<br>Your post is quite illuminating!  Wouldn't it be grand if there was a machine that we could hook up to each of our brains to actually understand how we think differently and, thus, how our thinking makes us feel and how it upholds our values to guide our motivations.  In some respects our thinking and doing styles are so diametrically opposite to each other, that it creates a dichotomous split in our productivity approaches.<br>Now that I understand that, I'll respectfully refrain from advising you to use methods that are  inimical to your thinking style.  These things are good to know and appreciate!  Thank you for daring to allow me to attempt to understand.  I won't lie to you.....in some respects, I don't think I ever will understand, just as you won't understand how or why  my grey matter sputters along as it does!

<div class="content">Hi learning as I go<br><br>Please please please don't stop trying to advise me - it is only by looking at what works and doesn't work, and then questiong why something does or doesn't work "for me" that I am learning so much more!  It was only your advice that made me realise that the timer approach doesn't always work for me and so caused me to question why.  Wasn't it edison who found thousands of way's "not" to invent the light bulb?  By identifying what doesn't work and asking why, I have a lot more chance of finding what does!<br><br>As for task hierarchy - well, now you're talking!  From an AF perspective all tasks "are" equal in that each will give you "one win" (i.e. task crossed off or dismissed).  However, the hierarchy system - that is where my project planning and management come in - I love structure and hierarchy but need to find some way of visually organising it.  I tend to take my eye off of what the black pieces are doing and then find all of my white pieces sulking in a corner somewhere!<br><br>Hope you're having a great day today - you've cheered me up and I hope you're able to enjoy a really great day :-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine<br>I'm that safe place in the world that you NEVER need to concern yourself with minor grammatical or spelling errors!  ROTFL!  My dad used grill us with spelling bees, but, in reference to writing, he used to say that although it's good to know how grammer and how to spell "somewhat", don't worry about it.  That's what secretaries and editors are for.  I was shocked to discover that this actually holds true.  I was slow in submitting my articles and book pages......I was told to simply IGNORE grammer, spelling and paragraphs.  It will be edited.  On one book I wrote,  I was SHOCKED to discover that the person they paid to proof my copy got a whopping 40K!!!!!!   I was flabbergasted.  When I wrote articles for a very popular website, I was told to set the timer for 15minutes and just type based on the list of topics they chose for me.  Sometimes it went over the 15 minutes if a flow state was created.  To help me to get rid of my self-consciousness, they had me do this via....Instant Messenger!  ROTFL!!!!   It was grand fun to go to the web site a few days later to set my crusty thinking all shined up!  ROTFL!!!<br>My pain made it too hard to keep it up the way they wanted me to, so I don't do that anymore....but when I was able, it was quite fun and quite rewarding!  Maybe, one day medical science will discover a procedure or a medication that might patch up some of my pain and I might write for others again.  <br><br>bottom line:  I would be a shameless hypocrite if I expected to receive what I can't/don't give!  LOL!  Besides, most of the time my brain doesn't even notice these things.  The message itself is as clear as if there weren't any errors.  I guess it's so used to how I write, that these things are a non issue!  *blush*<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">learning as you go,<br><br>loved the 3D chess example. Simply brilliant and thought provoking metaphor!<br><br>Was wondering, do you have fibromyalgia? I do hope you get back to writing in full force because you really are a writing gem. Don't wait on conventional medical science to get painfree, there are so many other avenues to explore feeling better.<br><br><br><br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">learning as I go - I just want to say how much your courage and attitude inspires and humbles me.  <br><br>In "Meditations", Marcus Aurelius discussed his teachers, one of the most important being Claudius Maximus:<br><br>"From Maximus I learned self-government, and not to be led aside by anything; and cheerfulness in all circumstances, as well as in illness; and a just admixture in the moral character of sweetness and dignity, and to do what was set before me without complaining. I observed that everybody believed that he thought as he spoke, and that in all that he did he never had any bad intention; and he never showed amazement and surprise, and was never in a hurry, and never put off doing a thing, nor was perplexed nor dejected, nor did he ever laugh to disguise his vexation, nor, on the other hand, was he ever passionate or suspicious. He was accustomed to do acts of beneficence, and was ready to forgive, and was free from all falsehood; and he presented the appearance of a man who could not be diverted from right, rather than of a man who had been improved. I observed, too, that no man could ever think that he was despised by Maximus, or ever venture to think himself a better man. He had also the art of being humorous in an agreeable way."<br><br>Anyway, that's how I think of you - will have to start calling you 'sage' rather than 'high priestess of the dross.' :-)<br></div>

<div class="content">Learning,<br><br>LOL ;-)<br><br>So just yesterday ... well, to start with you need some background to appreciate the story ;-) ... we have this big ole' tabby named Bubba.  He is a rescue from a basement in a restaurant in Manhattan.  He was warm and dry and the people who took him in loved him, but he was in darkness 24/7  ... no place for a cat!  He had been abandoned by his owners who had to move and thought nothing of discarding a member of their family.  So we captured him, over his strenuous objections (which, IIRC, involved several laps around the basement in and around boxes and a water heater ;-) and took him back to Maryland with us.  I think that kind of traumatized him because it has taken him more than five years to get over his skittishness.  But now he is in a big house with windows in every room, lots of furniture to sleep on and three other cats to chase him.  (To say nothing of owners who are WAY too found of their cats ;-)<br><br>And that is the second point.  We named him Bubba because he is a huge lumbering cat!  (Not fat, just big boned ... ROTF ;-)  As soon as we got him, every other cat chased him around and he shrieked like a little girl!  So we gave him the alternate name (wait for it) "Bubbles"  LOL ;-)  But he really is a gentle good dispositioned cat.  We love him.<br><br>Well, he has this habit of chewing on things, and he especially loves to chew (and eat) ribbons, string, thread, and packing tape!!!!  What is wrong with this cat?  So, now you are ready for my short story (with the endless introduction ;-)  He is always barfing .... and he makes the funniest sound, BTW.  Kind of like Eeeeeep!  And that coming out of this big ole honkin' cat is too funny to describe!  ROTF ;-)  So yesterday he does his barfing number and I cleaned it up <sigh> and it looked funny.  Upon examination (ewwww) I found a long piece of cellophane ... I think it was a sleeve from a toothpick wrapper.  No WONDER he is always barfing.  I'm glad he does!  I'd much rather pick up cat barf than pay vet bills!  Just another day in my life of hairballs, fur on clothes and furniture, litter scooping, and the occasional puddle of cat barf!   LOL ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike<br>Bubbles!  ROTFL!  ROTFL!  ROTFL!  Imagine poor Bubba on a couch free associating while his feline shrink compassionately and supportively listens......Then when Bubba relates his shame about being called Bubbles in front of the other cats.......I image two possible scenarios.<br>1.  The kitty shrink is forced to desperately swallow his own breath to avoid laughing out lous (while cautiously monitoring his sphincters as well) and chance further taumatizing poor Bubba<br>2.  ....or....The kitty shrink is caught unawares and bursts out in uncontrollable laughter, rolling on the ground, holding his aching belly....and poor Bubba thinks...."I'm paying $235 an hour for this?"<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike<br>I can't end the bubbles topic without this human story.  Ozzie Osbourne had a show called the Osbournes.  During one episode, we see Ozzie and Sharon preparing for one of his concerts.  As Sharon is showing Ozzie his prepared stage set, he sees myriads of bubbles produced by several bubble making machines overtaking the stage....<br>"BUBBLES???" Ozzie shouts in surprize and consternation....."I'm the Prince of Darkness!""   <br>I wish I was wearing diapers when he said that!  ROTFL!<br>learning as I go<br><br></div>
