<div class="content">Some of the jobs I've done need to be repeated in a month or so eg deflea the cats. <br>I've read some of the posts on what to do but rather than try other lists or places to write them, I'm trying an idea. <br>I am flicking thru a couple of empty pages ahead and writing them down there.<br>That way they will approx be around a month away, or will be a reminder to put it ahead another couple of pages.<br>Sounds good to me at the moment but obviously I wont know if it works for awhile.<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Margherita<br><br>My own recommendation would be to try AF exactly as Mark recommends.  As you have seen there are a number of posts regarding scheduled items and Mark suggests keeping those items separate in whatever diary/scheduling tool you use.  Standard To Do Lists often leave you with a reluctance to put certain items that we don't want to do on them.  One of the things I have found is that, because AF does away with that reluctance but allows - even encourages - us to throw everything at it, then the lists may well grow quicker than you think and what will you then do when your page is filled up already?<br><br>If your existing scheduling system is not working well for you then try using AF to create a new one, e.g. list a task like "set up new scheduling system".  That is what I did and it really helped me - if anything comes to mind that needs scheduling, rather than stop what I am doing, I just add a task "schedule item x".  I also have a task "check schedule" which gets relisted at the end of my list each time I action it.</div>

<div class="content">Margherita<br><br>You might like to try setting up a recurring task in Outlook if it is available to you.</div>

<div class="content">What I'm trying now is to AF list it at the end but start the item with date eg "Feb 28 deflea cats" <br>When I read the lists I'll ignore the date start ones till they are the end of the page and if still not due to do I'll move it to the end of the total list again.<br><br>I find if I have lists and reminders everywhere I forget to check them. But if I write "check" on AF it will be sorted!!!!<br><br>I'll also check out outlook and someone mentioned rememberthemilk.com. And when they come up I can add them to AF<br><br><br></div>
