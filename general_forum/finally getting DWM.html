<div class="content">I've struggled for a while with paper-based and digital implementations of DWM, and I've decided to stick with paper for now (again). After 2 weeks working this way, I'm finally getting a feel for why DWM works: it gives a very good idea of how much I've committed to, how much needs to be done in the upcoming days and weeks, and how much a day's work is for me.<br><br>Although digital would be more efficient for DWM (it's easier to move a task to the 1-week point in a good digital implementation), a digital implementation doesn't give a very good feel of how many full pages are ahead of today's page. Plus it's easier to get caught in 'tweaking the system' with a digital implementation.<br><br>So I'm a happy DWM-user again. Thanks Mark!</div>

<div class="content">I'm using DWM implemented with Microsoft Outlook Tasks, and it works great, for the same reasons you mention.<br><br>In Outlook, I group the tasks by due date (I use the "due date" field for the expiration date).  Then I can show all the open tasks on one screen - but I can "collapse" all the due dates to see only one due date at a time, if I want.  This lets me focus on one "page" at a time.  <br><br>Or, I can expand them all, or a few of them, to get a better feel for everything that's on my plate.  <br><br>Or, I can filter to show only the tasks that expire this week -- forming a kind of "hot list".<br><br>There is always the temptation to tweak it.  But since it works so well, that temptation is far weaker than with other electronic time-management tools I've used, like Toodledo or Remember the Milk, or just using Outlook tasks with no consistent methodology behind it.<br><br>One thing I really like about doing this in Outlook is that any email can become a task with single click and then shows up on my DWM list.</div>
