<div class="content">The parts of AF which were initially a bit unclear to me were when to move to a new page and when to dismiss an item. Otto Fox's summary in another thread was very helpful (see the fourth reply on <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/692231" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/692231</a> ).<br><br>As a result of my own confusion and certain quesions by others on this Forum, I revised Quick Start steps 5-8 and added step 9 (text between / is to be italic):<br><br>------- Revised version of steps 5-8 -------<br>  5. Continue going round the same page in the same way /until no item stands out for you/. <br><br>  6. When you complete a pass of the page without any item standing out, move onto the next page and repeat the process.<br><br>  7. Once you’ve finished with the final page, re-start at the first page which still has items that are not crossed off (this is your first “active” page).<br><br>  8. If you ever go to a page and no item stands out for you on your  /first/ pass through it, then all the outstanding items on that page are dismissed without re-entering them. Use a highlighter to mark dismissed items. (N.B. This does not apply to the final page, on which you are still writing items.)<br><br>  9. The next day you begin work, start the process again at the top of the last page you were working on.<br>-------<br><br>The main differences are these:<br>  a. Step 5 has been simplified to deal only with repeated passes on the same page.<br><br>  b. Step 6 deals with moving to the next page, restating the original prohibition of step 5b in a positive way.<br><br>  c. Step 7 is the original step 8. It has been reordered here because it is a special case of step 6, i.e. the end of the sequential progression through all pages. It also defines what an "active" page is -- a term left implicit not only in the original steps but indeed in all of <a href="http://www.markforster.net/autofocus-system/" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/autofocus-system/</a> . <br><br>  d. Step 8 is the original step 7. It has been reordered here because it can apply to any page, i.e. generally to the list as a whole. As such, it seemed disruptive to the sequential relation between original steps 6 and 8. The general condition is expressed by the addition of "ever". Finally, the N.B. has been moved to the end of the paragraph to make it a bit more prominent.<br><br>  e. Italics are used for the two key conditions in steps 5 and (new) 8.<br><br>  f. Step 9 has been added.</div>

<div class="content">I like the rephrasing, but we of course we'll have to see what Mark will finally draw up as the definitive procedure.</div>

<div class="content">Otto:<br><br>Just to clarify, the existing instructions *are* the definitive procedure. I don't have any plans to re-write them.<br><br>Scott Y:<br><br>I don't find your rewrite to be more clear than the original. Your Step 5 is confusing. What is meant by "you go round the page in the same way until no item stands out for you"? You only explain what is meant in your Step 6.<br><br>You are also defining "active" page incorrectly. It is not the first page which still has items which have not been crossed off. It is the first page on which there are items which are still active. This is clear in my instructions because the paragraph in which I mention pages being "active" follows the description of dismissing items.<br><br>You final paragraph is wrong. You should start again where you left off, not go back to the top of the page.</div>

<div class="content">Obviously the instructions are Mark's alone to rewrite when and if he chooses, but I DO think the switching of steps 7 and 8 in this version makes slightly more logical sense. I think i would have been less initially confused about dismissal if it had been phrased in this way.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>Thanks for the corrections, that's helpful. That a user may not fully understand the process and yet get great benefit from it, as I have, is a sign of AF's strength. I'm very grateful for it.<br><br>In following AF, I was uncertain about some features and noticed similar questions from others on this Forum: when to move on to the next page, how dismissal worked, and where to restart in the list. I presumed the beta stage is partly to elicit such user experiences, even misunderstandings. I meant no offense in what I posted, and if it was offensive in any way, I do apologize.</div>

<div class="content">Two points - most days I have to start on my current, newest page as it contains items from projects I am working on which have to be actioned asap and there isn't time at that moment to go back to an earlier page.<br><br>Am I right in thinking that if I am able to start at the first active page and work forward through the pages that day, then the NEXT day I continue on the last page I was working on the day before, not from the top of the page, but from the last item that stood out.<br>ie. - I don't go back to the first active page everyday, but only when I have reached the end of all the active pages, even if that has taken a few days?<br><br>Have I understood this correctly?</div>

<div class="content">In my opinion tasks that must be done ASAP, should be entered in AF and be dealt with accordingly. However, if I have have any tasks that must be done according to a deadline, I enter them in my diary to be done on the day on which I commit myself to do them (which could well be before the deadline). I treat all entries in my diary as fixed commitments and  normally I deal with such entries in priority relative to other daily tasks.<br><br>For your second point, I would refer you to Mark's comment in <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/692231" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/692231</a> .</div>
