<div class="content">This Forum's comments are defended both by Captcha and by spam filters, but even so some spam is going to get through occasionally.<br><br>Please ignore it when it does. All that commenting on a spam post achieves is to raise the thread back to the top of the pile - so you are in effect helping the spammers get their message across.<br><br>It can also make it difficult for me to remove spam messages if they have non-spam comments attached. When I report a spam thread, all comments in that thread will reported at the same time - so the commenters are in danger of being branded as spammers themselves. The only way I can prevent this is by removing each individual comment manually, thus doubling or tripling the work involved.<br><br>My normal policy is to allow commercial messages that are of direct relevance to the subject matter of this website, but this is always a matter of judgement. Please respect the fact that my judgement in the matter may not always be the same as yours!<br><br>Thank you!</div>
