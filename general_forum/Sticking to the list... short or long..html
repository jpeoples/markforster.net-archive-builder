<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2018-12-9 16:49</div>
<div class="content">I've tried most of Mark's systems. I have found the principles behind the systems novel and refreshing. However, I have never been able to sustain my commitment to any of the systems beyond a few days... weeks max. There's a myriad of reasons why this is so. But the primary reason is that - unlike Mark - I can't/won't work from the list all day. So I found this short thread (and advice) on Reddit helpful. To choose an anchor(s) during my day to solely work from the list. And overtime, this will become a habit. <br><br>Does anyone else employ something similar? Or do most of you - like Mark - work off the list for most of the day?<br><br>https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/a4lnr2/has_anybody_understood_the_value_of_productivity/</div>

<div class="content">Interesting. I do work off my list for most of my (work) days, but I am finding more and more that I will use different methods for processing during the day. When I first come in, I almost always use AF2 revised, which allows me to deal with the end of the list first. After a full cycle around the list, I may do an FV, which gives me focus on preselecte dtasks. I will often  do it as a modified 3 or 5T (which I know is officially a no-list method) where I timebox each 3-5 tasks and replace when 2 or 3 are done.<br><br>If I am still working, I may go back to AF2 or if the brain is fried, do a Randomizer.<br><br>Anyone else switch methods throughout the day.</div>

<div class="content">One way to look at it: you can do any task as long as you feel like.  So suppose you pick something you plan to do for the next few hours.  You aren't during that time tied to the list.<br><br>But in general, I don't stick to following the list all day morning to night.  I will pick it up for a time, and at some time I will either switch to a major project or just kind of peter off the list until later.</div>

<div class="content"><<I will either switch to a major project or just kind of peter off the list until later.>><br><br>I have done the same. And then my thinking goes: If I’m working away from the list/system, I don’t need it. <br><br>My goal is to find a less haphazard way of leaving/returning to the structure and rules of Simple Scanning.</div>

<div class="content">As I said in the first paragraph: If "Work on Project X" is your selection, doing that for an extended period of time is not actually leaving the structure, but is actually following the rules.<br><br>Another way is to schedule it.  When the alarm goes, switch modes between working the list and doing that other thing.</div>

<div class="content">You can write things like this on your list:<br>Wrap up loose ends, 45 min<br>Free flow, up to 5 tasks<br>SMEMA chain, 7 tasks (SMEMA = write 3 things, do 2, write 2 more...)<br>Cherry-pick whole list for things related to X<br>Switch to favorite No-List system for 2 hours...<br><br>Dot one, and leave the list without leaving it.</div>

I guess if we are always tinkering we never have stability. So we need to find a more effective way of resolving this conflict between stability and improvement. But I would guess that living completely without systems would only exacerbate that conflict not resolve it.</div>

<div class="content">Here's a quote:<br><br><< The most productive people frequently try new systems instead of finding and sticking with a single method that fits their style. “For six months, they’ll use a version of [David Allen’s Getting Things Done] with files and ticklers,” says Duhigg. “Then, they’ll decide to try a new system, maybe using color-coded tabs and inboxes. Then they’ll find another new system,” he says. “Constantly cycling through systems forces you to think about your own productivity.” >></div>

No!

<div class="content">Avrum:<br><br>What I found to work best for me is to set a prompt/trigger for each item on my list. My list isn't long and the items on my list only take 30 seconds or less (I make it this way by design). But having prompts for easy behaviors builds repetition, and repetition creates productivity. Some prompts are task based (After I wake up, After I check my calendar), others are time based (After 2 P.M, After 4:30 P.M).</div>

<div class="content">I was chatting earlier today with Melanie, one of the forum old-timers who hasn't been around much lately. She just published a new book based on her series of blog posts from ~5 years ago where she tried out a new time management system every week for a whole year, and blogged the results. The new book is available here: <a href="http://grammargalaxybooks.com/product/a-year-of-living-productively-digital/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://grammargalaxybooks.com/product/a-year-of-living-productively-digital/</a><br><br>Interestingly, she makes the same point as Duhigg:<br><br><< When I began outlining the book based on my year of experimenting, I thought I would be writing a best-practices book. I foolishly believed that I could determine which methods would work best for you. The years that followed the series taught me that I couldn’t even predict which methods would work for me! I realized that experimenting with productivity methods IS the best practice. It isn’t something to undertake for just a year but for as long as you desire to get<br>more done. >></div>

<div class="content">Interesting post. Sadly I have no solution. Like you I tried many things GTD, MF lists AF1 and so on there is always a time where all goes wrong. I can stick as hardly as I can it will go wrong at a certain point. I call it the parkinson effect. I think the effect is caused by the number of tasks and choices to do. If I put it in a data base such as Omnifocus it is organized but not really engaging in action. If I put it on a MF list it getting longer and longer and at a a certain point impossible for me to make a crucial choice. It is tempting to put relevant stuff in a box but at a certain point I spend more time organizing than doing. So what do I do ? I understand that our brain is able to choose and make optimal choices. I also understand that I am a paper man. So a sheet of paper is better for me than a digital file. Better for thinking, better for acting. All methods are just guideline some works for once and evaluates. The best is to stick to goals first. Then make choices to put your efforts on what matter at the present time. At last make some planification for acting in the future. When things gets complicated I open a paper folder where I jot notes about this sunject and make summarizing later.  I try to make things simple. IE braistorming in the morning of my first 10 items juste numbered as they come to me. I try to focus on solution not on tasks. I try to delegate and follow what I attend from others. I put everything on my paper note book one by one and read the list again and again not as an engagement but as a reminder of stuff I need to do. I also accept that I can't do anything but only what matter the most at the present time. I also accept my imperfection. My human nature. I prefer a certain kind of burden that a strict organisation because my brain sorts naturally what must be done. And I also have a very big trash where I jot all my written and irrelevant papers. I try at last to take life as it is. Un permanent. Chaotic. But surprising and opportunistic. At now 56 years old (67 in February 14 th)  I understand that methods, structures and so on are just a way of avoiding stuff to do at the right time also that from chaos comes light little by little.</div>

<div class="content">Chris:<br><br>Yes, I almost always work longer than 30 seconds on a task, but if I complete the task then I don't feel guilty not doing anything more.<br><br>The reason I make my tasks tiny is so they always occur. The reason I specify when to do them is to build repetition.<br><br>When I started the system, most of the time I would only do the small task, but I would feel successful because that was all I asked myself to do.<br><br>Stealing an analogy from the book Mini Habits by Stephen Guise, doing a new behaviour is like introducing a cat to snow for the first time. If you throw the cat into the snow it's just going to run back inside. If you place the cat near the edge of the snow it's more likely to be interested in the snow and venture out when it feels ready.<br><br>Our brains like to do what they've already done, introducing something new takes time and repetition. If I start small then this new behaviour wont feel threatening to my brains normal routines.</div>

<div class="content">I've observed a pattern.  It happens naturally, not by plan, and is I think very good.<br><br>I start out working in the list doing very small things or small amounts of big things.  Gradually I start picking up bigger things and taking longer.  Once I get into the flow, I start taking on longer tasks and referencing the list less.  I may notice other things that need doing and do them without the list, and then another thing.  Then resuming the list and moving on, I ultimately come on something that I will stick to for an hour or more, after which the list falls away.  If I do bits in the middle of that long task, it won't be with reference to the list.  After I'm done the big task (for now), then I may return to the list again, depending on the hour and mood.</div>

<div class="content">I find it helps to stick to my list / current system by using a note book I love.<br><br>I recently started a BIG (several months) project so I bought a new moleskein to track it in. It has lined pages on the right and blank pages on the left. So I can draw pictures on one side, and make lists on the other side.

<div class="content">By Melanie via Seraphim:<br><br><<I realized that experimenting with productivity methods IS the best practice>><br><br>I've been wondering if we could say that it's generally good practise to have a portion of one's time/efforts spent on experimentation. Examples:<br><br>- we read what we're interested in but also skim other things to see if anything else catches our interest<br>- a college degree is often composed of a major plus electives. Those electives could spark entirely new directions.<br>- we watch YouTube videos from channels we know, and YouTube throws up new channels that might interest us<br>- we maintain our "base suite" of productivity practises for most of our weeks, but try out new practises with a subset of our activities.<br>- local governments mostly do business as usual, but some conduct pilot projects for new ideas<br>- businesses/professionals have time for "professional development" where they might be exposed to new ideas in their field</div>

<div class="content">Exactly so: anything that never changes becomes stagnant.  A novel set of rules can be great at tackling a list of problems, but the work done, and life itself, changes the nature of that list of problems.  The rules still function, but the list has changed and the rules may be less effective than they were.  <br><br>For me, it’s primarily that “familiarity breeds contempt”.  The more you know a thing, the more you know its flaws and the more they vex you.  Likely it’s possible for a system of rules to fade into the background by focusing on making something else new and exciting (the content of the list, over the form of processing), but a different environment might be better suited to different rules anyhow.   <br><br>I crave novelty to an extent that I chafe at same-yness, so innovation brings back the attraction.  And as Melanie says, there’s value in this because exploring brings new ideas which can lead to improvement.  Not exploring keeps the old ideas which may no longer be as effective as they were.</div>

<div class="content">It's true that there's a sense of boredom that can creep in when something stays the same for a long time, and I'm as susceptible to that as anyone.<br><br>However, in some areas, I've discovered that this sometimes is something that you can effectively fight against, and indeed, might derive significant benefit in fighting against. I've found that with a lot of my tools, taking a "simplest available" and "don't change the defaults" approach can actually be liberating. Rather than allowing myself to be tempted to endlessly tweak something, and as a result, never quite be satisfied, because there is always something just a little bit better out there somewhere, even within the tool itself (I can always make it just a little bit better), by *not* allowing myself to tweak things, I find myself somehow a little more accepting, and often I find that I end up being able to use the tools more effectively. <br><br>I'm in the minority in my field with regards to this, but I've had extremely good success with this. I learned that the endless tweaking of systems and tools took a pretty heavy toll on my productivity, and when I stopped doing that as much, and letting things "do their thing" rather than changing them all the time, I got better results. <br><br>I *think* this holds true for my Time Management systems as well, but I'm not quite sure yet.</div>
