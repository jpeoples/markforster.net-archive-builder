<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>I do hope you are well.  I have noticed that there is a growing amount of spam that is showing up on this forum.  I am sure you are working with the website people on this, but it is annoying.<br><br>I will be adding a post soon describing my last few weeks of work with DIT and additional experiences -- all positive!<br><br>Best regards,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>I did not mean to be critical, but was just sharing my frustration -- and I am sure others -- on the increasing amount of spam here.  Mark, are you okay?  Any news as to new reviews of DIT?  <br><br>Best wishes,<br>-David</div>
