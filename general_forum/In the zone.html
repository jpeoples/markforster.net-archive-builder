<div class="content">I know what it's like to be "in the zone" where I get so focused on one activity, that I get lots done with little effort, and rather enjoy the experience. <br><br>I don't know what it's like to be "in the zone" with a system like SuperFocus, bouncing from task to task. A large obstacle has so far been my situation: interruptions, urgency, backlogs,    stresses, and generally not in the mood for sustained focus. <br><br>I'm hoping tomorrow will be different. I've spent much of this evening unwinding, and resting , and a bit of contemplation of tomorrows work. I have nothing urgent, nothing planned, no huge backlogs, and lots of important stuff I want to work on with no pressing need to make great advances on any of it. God willing, I'll get a lot done tomorrow. (prior to SF, I know I'd get stir crazy in under 4 hours.)</div>

<div class="content">Does anybody have anything to share on the topic?  The idea is that work becomes effortless through the repetition of the system, and stuff gets done without noticing how slow time progresses.</div>

<div class="content">Personally I've found the key to getting into "the zone" with SF is to pay strict attention to the "standing out" method of selecting tasks:<br><br>(1) When coming to a new page, read through the page fairly quickly, not pausing to really think about the tasks, but simply refreshing your memory of what's there.  This "primes" your subconscious mind which seems to start processing and balancing priorities unconsciously.<br><br>(2) Start back at the top of the list and read each item more ponderously.  Wait for that feeling of "yes!  this one really wants to be done now".    Ignore the rational mind's analysis -- "yes that's really important I'd really better start working on that now".   Go deeper, and only action the tasks that have that deeper resonance.<br><br>I'm not quite sure how else to describe it.  But following this method makes it easy for me to "get into the zone" pretty quickly, and stay there, even when dealing with dozens of miscellaneous tasks intermixed with more significant and sustained project work.   In practice it feels like I am just "flowing" through my task list.<br><br>Somehow even interruptions just seem like part of this flow.  This is really different from that feeling of "runners high" or "in the zone" you can get when your're really deep into some project.   When you're deep into a single project like that, you really want to keep the train of thought going, and any interruption seems to pull you away from that and becomes really annoying, even disruptive.  Working with SF, if one of my children walks into my home office with a question, even when I'm deep into writing or coding or something, I find it's much easier to say, "just a sec", quickly wrap up whatever I'm doing, and then give the interruptor my attention.  <br><br>When the interruption is done, it's not that difficult to get back into the SF list and to resume that deep sustained attention on a particular project.  If I feel like it, I can just keep right on going with the project where I left off.  But if it's been disrupted a bit, then I can just move it forward to C2 on next page, and keep processing the current page.  That seems to get me back into "the zone" pretty quickly, and then when I come to the next page and start actioning that project again which I had left off, it's easy to get into that deep state of flow and deep attention.<br><br>I'm not quite sure why it works that way -- this easy handing of interruptions.   Maybe the interruption is mentally just a new "urgent C2 task" so it's no big deal -- whereas pre-SF, I had nowhere to "bookmark" my work and no effective way to mentally categorize the interruption.   The interruption would create a disturbing sense of disorder, and it would often take quite a long time to recover from the interruption -- it could even ruin my whole day, never being able to "get back into" the project that was interrupted and recover the "flow".<br><br>It's not ALWAYS that smooth but SF really helps me to get into that flowing state and stay there for long periods.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim, much of what you just wrote describes where I am now with SF.<br><br>"Little and often" was not sustainably working for me in my first weeks of SF, though I saw the potential and knew that I needed to learn to make it work for my own sanity. SF taught me to recognize that my "long interrupted blocks" were actually fairly interrupted (by others and by my own little breaks), and that I perceived others' interruptions as a drain on my energy. I used to resist taking the time to "bookmark" my place, imagining it terribly inefficient, compared to collecting my thoughts and pressing on. Part of this need to press on came from the well-founded fear that I might not get back to this project again for days or weeks.<br><br>SuperFocus has already changed this enough to make me much more efficient and experience much more flow. And I am convinced that I have only begun to tap into it!<br><br>I think the biggest factor for flow (or "the zone") is that I am noticing all those little transitions when a project goes from Pull to Push, and I am using those as stopping points to switch projects. Thus, I am almost always working on something that "stands out" or "pulls me along," whereas in the past I spent much of my precious "project time" dragging myself along.<br><br>Since I have much improved my "Art of C2," the switching is not detracting from my ability to finish top-priority things. In fact, I feel like I am finishing more with a lot less effort.</div>

<div class="content">I agree with Seraphim about it being really really important to do the standing out bit. The whole idea of AF/SF is that its supposed to be intuitive and if you try to force it then the effortless part disappears and it just becomes another todo list. But I think another important factor is to take the dismissal rules seriously. A lot of people seem to think that its a disaster if they dismiss something but I htink its just part of the process and a very important one at that. The thing is that if you dont take the dismissal rules seriously then thats going to effect the way you approach the whole list. Any way Mark said his next tip would be about dismissing though its a few days overdue. I hope he gets a move on, theyre supposed to be daily tips arent they?</div>

<div class="content">I'm listening to a radio program wherein a researcher is talkng about multitasking. The finding is that multitaskers are less efficient at working, and particularly surprising, they are measurably worse even at multitasking activities. For example, switching to check email for one minute was considered counter productive. Better was to put it off until your prepared to spend a full 15 minutes at it. <br><br>Now when you're smoothly flowing, do you find <br>A) you focus strongly on the one selected task<br>b) you tend to do tasks for longer periods (15 minutes or more, not counting little items)<br>c) both<br>d) neither.</div>

<div class="content">(A) but not (B).<br><br>The weird thing about the "standing out" rule is that I can focus more deeply on the selected task, but when the time comes to switch, the switch happens pretty quickly, and then I'm focusing more deeply on the new task.<br><br>Pre-AF it used to take me 15 minutes (or more!) to switch from one run-of-the-mill task like "take out the trash" to another like "clear work email".   I'd take out the trash, then come back to my computer and check my personal Gmail, then think, "oh yeah, gotta check work email", didn't really WANT to check email, found myself web surfing instead, or poking through the stack of papers on my desk, then FINALLY I'd get around to working on my email.<br><br>Now it's much easier to make the transition.  Just go back to the SF list, see what's next, "Clear email" stands out, switch over to NEO and start processing.  After 30 seconds into it I'm totally focused on email.  I might still get bored with it after a few minutes, park "Clear email" in C2 next page, and switch to the next thing that "stands out"; but those few minutes were very effective, I was focused on the task at hand, I made progress on it.<br><br>This doesn't suffer from the multi-tasking penalty because I really am doing just one thing at a time, and the transition from full focus on task 1 and full focus on task 2 is very brief.<br><br>David Allen keeps using an analogy in his podcasts lately -- how a martial artist appears to be fighting four opponents at the same time, but in reality is focused only on one at a time.  I think it applies here very well.   (Whenever I listen to those podcasts, I keep thinking how much more effective David and his followers could be if they added SF to their toolbox!)</div>

<div class="content">> I'm listening to a radio program ... that multi-taskers are less efficient ...<br><br>Alan, the people on the radio are absolutely correct, but they are only talking about Push Mode, without realizing there is anything else. That is my take, after experiencing Pull Mode at the hands of SuperFocus.<br><br>This is really only about one simple thing: whenever we work, we *naturally* interrupt ourselves sooner or later: we get bored, we get stuck, we get clever ideas about an unrelated project and wish we were working on it instead. At that point, we are going to experience inefficiency no matter what comes next. That is when it usually pays to switch tasks.<br><br>Outside interruptions (phone calls, appliance failures, ice-cream truck jingles) are different, because they are more likely to cut us off in the middle of productive flow. Same goes for artificially self-imposed interruptions, like arbitrary time boxes ("just when I was *really* getting somewhere, the timer rang!") or multi-tasking items that don't complement each other, such as cooking eggs while analyzing a legal document. Much better to cook eggs while installing computer updates; neither requires sustained focus, and each makes use of the other's down time.<br><br>So, if you are a robot, or if Project X has you so enthralled that you stay at the top of your game for a solid four hours, then stay on it for four hours (and this does happen). But when you notice that you've slipped, don't soldier on. Let SuperFocus find you something else that "stands out" and is still worth your time (as it made it onto your list). If Project X is super-urgent, put it in C2 and you'll be back on it soon.<br><br>This is how I've come to interpret "work on it for as long as you feel like." Of course there's a catch: you do have to know how much time you can afford for Project X, and you do have to stop if you hit this limit. If you find a way around that, let me know! That's what the "today list" is for, or our calendars and tickler files, etc. We can only work "as long as we feel like" within the hard landscape of our schedule and "Due Today" items. Even if your entire day is free, you'll eventually have to stop "feeling like it" so you can eat or sleep.<br><br>To answer your survey, Alan, I am finding myself consistently in (A) while (B) varies greatly. Although, yes, it is normally more than fifteen minutes. The more I allow SuperFocus to manage (B)—the more I stay aware of any building resistance or loss of focus—the more I get done.<br><br>You could say SuperFocus has taught me to multi-task, or you could say it has taught me to be more efficient at doing one thing at a time. Either way, it is a much-needed improvement!<br><br>One final concern: I have to imagine those studies, like the one on the radio, must have a very difficult time measuring the "tunnel vision" factor. That is, I've been surprised how often I *think* I am really kicking butt on a project, and I resent the interruption, yet upon returning, I immediately notice a much more effective approach, or I see that I've skipped something important. Then, I am glad the interruption pushed me out of my tunnel vision. I have a hard time imagining how that effect would be measured in a study with test subjects performing (presumably) standardized, quantifiable tasks.</div>
