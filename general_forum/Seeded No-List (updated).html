<div class="content">This system has been going quite well. <br><br>I generally follow the system as written, but it's very flexible.<br><br>For example, if I don't have time to make my "commit list" in the evening, I can just make it the next morning. <br><br>If I find I finished my "commit list" early in the day, I can make a new one for the afternoon. <br><br>I typically have 3 items on my list. Usually it's one "current initiative" kind of thing, which can continue on the list for a few days. And then there are usually two other smaller things that are pressing for some reason.<br><br>If I know my day is going to be full of meetings or travel, I'll choose a smaller number of items.<br><br>I keep each daily list in my Moleskine notebook, together with meeting notes, ideas, agendas, dynamic lists for projects, etc. I love keeping it all in one place -- very easy to scan backwards to review notes and thoughts. To keep the basic system running, it's as easy as starting a new page for the commit list every day, and working from that list. <br><br>Anyway, it continues to give just the right amount of focus to be systematic; the "no-list" component makes it very flexible and responsive to the dynamics of the day; and it's fast and easy with no mental overhead at all. It feels more like a thinking tool than a task system.</div>
