<div class="content">I'm working right now with AF2, another system I like, but there are lots of older tasks languishing; I feel reluctant to dismiss them, which I probably should, but there's stuff there that I want to do. Anyway, I'm thinking of trying to do reverse af1: starting with the last page, doing whatever stands out like AF1 and just going to the previous page once there's nothing else that needs to be done, keeping the pages as closed lists as I move through them, using the regular AF1 dismissals (no dismissal on the last page). I'm re-writing my old list on a new moleskin, thought I might try this out. Just wondering if anyone else has tried it.</div>
