<div class="content">In the last weeks, I developped the habit of marking tasks as "I should really start this one as soon as possible" while reading through the whole list - similar to how it was later proposed as CONDENSED AF. I am asking myself whether this is a useful technique or not.<br><br>Pro:<br><br>+ The very thought of "this one is ripe to be acted upon" might be considered as coming from the unconscious and therefore worth an action, and be it a simple mark besides the task.<br><br>+ If you jump from marked task to marked task, you make your way through the list more quickly.<br><br>Contra:<br><br>- Over time, more and more tasks get marked the same way (and not necessarily acted upon the same day), so the value of that mark diminishes. - Question: Is this really a bad thing? And what about repeating the mark? Why not having !!tasks and !!!!tasks?)<br><br>- Marking reflects the state of consciousness in the moment I read through the list, but not necessarily the state of consciousness in the moment I have to choose the next tasks. So it may bias the "standing out" process.<br><br>What do others think?<br></div>

<div class="content">Andreas,<br><br>I think that any single tweak might be very useful.  I also think as tweaks tend to be added to tweaks you might end up with something really tangled and convoluted.<br><br>I also have experimented with marking priority/urgency/importance for tasks.  It changes the character of the AF list idea.  One thing I noticed was that I marked TOO MANY things as high priority.  In a sense, EVERYthing on my list is a high priority for me!  ;-)  But if you have more than one high priority item, then you probably don't have a good handle on what "priority" means.  That was what I concluded for myself, anyway.<br><br>My solution was to pull items off the list onto an index card of things I really intended to do TODAY.  It gave me a view of what I had on my plate and things were not left buried in a long list.  (Marking a priority is not much good if you don't even see the task!)<br><br>Basically, the way I view it is that if you have multiple tags, priorities, colors, symbols, Post-Its, paper clips, etc. you are probably playing with your list way too much and should probably think about DOING some of those things ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Why not have a limit of up to three marked tasks?<br><br>Also why not work the list normally?</div>

<div class="content">Marking tasks during the read through seems sensible to me - but I only mark ones of the 'must do today' type. This ensures that they stand out and that I keep an overview of how much urgent stuff there is on my plate that day. I may treat myself to some sticky post it arrows to make the marking more fun - but for now it's just a dash in the margin which gets crossed through when done!</div>

<div class="content">What happens to those "must do today" tasks that don't get done?  Do you dismiss them?  If not, then obviously they really didn't need to be done that day.  <br><br>If you aren't going to dismiss those "must do today" tasks that don't get done, then you might just be better off following the rules and doing those tasks that stand out.  Mark has designed AF to help your conscious and subconscious mind  make those decisions while following the rules.  There was likely some reason you choose as you did.</div>

<div class="content">MartyH,<br>In my case the 'must do today' tasks are only time sensitive ones and tend to come towards the end of the list.  They 'stand out' during the initial read through of the list, so I mark them as essential to be done.  NB these are not just tasks I would like to do today but things that will get worse if not done today. So they do get done well before dismissal would be an issue.  Again, speaking for myself, if for some reason a candidate for dismissal could simply not be dismissed, because it still had to be done, then I would follow common sense and not dismiss it!  But more likely, as I am finding, I would push myself to do some work on it to 'keep within the rules', and add it back to the end of the list.  So I think I am more or less following the rules, at least in the way that makes sense to me!</div>
