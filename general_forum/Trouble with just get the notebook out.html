<div class="content">I've been dabbling with the system since the start of beta testing and when I work the system, it works well - I finally have my first page finished with only 4 tasks dismissed as they were all part of a home reno project that I've decided to complete in a more systematic room by room fashion since I originally developed my list back on Jan. 6.<br><br>My problem lies in actually getting the book open and starting work on my items - as it's been said, sometimes half the battle is in just getting the file out - or in this case notebook opened.   I have a separate notebook for home and work - I'm in a new job which doesn't require any o.t. and I can actually leave work at work for the first time in my life.  I do have a consulting client where I put in an additional ~10 hours/week as well, most of that from home, but the occasional weekend 1/2 day in the office.<br><br>I do want to progress on my home tasks however, which primarily consist of cleaning, errands, some fun things, and home renovations.<br><br>How do other people deal with scheduling autofocus time?  By the time I'm home, finished walking the dog and dinner is done, I have about 2 hours of discretionary time (I am also a single parent).  I'm finding myself avoiding my home notebook in that period of time.  And I'm also finding myself avoiding it on weekends as well, although I have lots of discretionary time then but start surfing the net or reading a novel.  Typically, I'll put in about 3 hours on a Saturday morning and that's it.  But that's not enough to get the jobs done that I need to this year to be able to renovate and sell my house by Dec. 31.<br><br>One good thing that's come out of writing down many of the home renovation tasks is that I've become very prone towards deciding to delegate or pay for many of the projects to be done vs. previously thinking I could do it all myself.  Typically, if it's a high resistance task, I decided to pay someone else.<br><br>Any help is much appreciated!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jaqueline,<br><br>I would recommend time boxing. Plan out your discretionary time in advance, schedule x hours for the work notebook, y hours for the home notebook and perhaps z hours for flexible notebook use to accommodate for fluctuating balance between them. The point is, if you are in a time period you scheduled for home notebook use, you are not allowed to open the other notebook.<br><br>I use that approach since I currently work at home, so I have to draw sharp boundaries so I don't avoid the af list with the less appealing items.<br><br>Regards,<br>Andreas</div>

<div class="content">Oh, and schedule some free time for surfing or reading, too. All work and no play makes Jacqueline a dull girl, if you'll pardon the expression. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Andreas, <br><br>Thanks for your reply.  My problem isn't with picking up the other notebook - the work notebook stays at work.  It's with not opening up my home notebook at all.  If the home renovations weren't so important to me, I would just be more gradual with them, but I'm planning on going on sabbatical / early retiring on Dec. 31 and doing some travelling in my motorhome for ~ 8 months, so I need to get this house sold.  I've put off doing renovations for the last 4 years that I've lived here (I used to work a lot of overtime), so the fact that I am making some progress with AF is a great thing.<br><br>I also tend to resist scheduling "having to do the notebook" during the discretionary time that I do have.   I did put in some fun activities (like reading) in my first couple of weeks, but haven't followed up with that - maybe that's the problem, I need to get drawn into the notebook by not allowing myself to read without having it on the list.  I have had success in the past by "sandwiching" activities on a list - fun task / not-fun task - repeat.  Even with that method, I could only keep at it for maximum 3-4 hours, and only on Saturday mornings.   <br><br>My ideal goal would be to put in at least 1/2 hr / day in from M-F and at least 3 hours / day on both Saturday and Sunday.   But when I get home, I just can't seem to make myself start.  <br><br></div>

<div class="content">Oh, sorry, I misunderstood. When you said you had a consulting client for which you work at home and at the office, I thought that these tasks where on a separate autofocus list.<br><br>I still think it would be a good idea to schedule times where you don't have to use the notebook (Stephen Covey's "unschedule"), so you'll resist opening the notebook less in the remaining time, knowing you're guaranteed to do something fun later.<br><br>I haven't tried putting fun things on AF so far, I tend to keep work and play chronologically separated.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br><br>You say that "I've been dabbling with the system since the start of beta testing and when I work the system, it works well - I finally have my first page finished with only 4 tasks dismissed".  I wonder if perhaps you have not really been using the system "properly" in some way.  The whole thing about the system is that it does reduce resistance (almost eliminates it in fact) so is it possible that you are treating it more as a to do list rather than doing only the items that stand out when they stand out?  Because of that "standing out" process, if you are using the system as it is designed, you will at all times be doing "what you feel like", whether that be reno tasks, walking the dog, reading a novel or hoovering the carpet.<br><br>I find that it really helps me to ensure that I do have fun and "small" tasks on each page, and wherever possible to keep tasks relatively short.  Project time blocks then seem to occur naturally when appropriate.  Using my notebook is very far removed from scheduling for me - I too totally resist scheduling and love the freedom of doing what I want which I get with AF.  One highly important task for me is "thinking time" which I can also recommend.  Just a thought but are there perhaps some hidden resistances to the idea of selling the house? Regardless of how much you may be looking forward to going travelling, selling your home is a pretty major event!<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi there, it's definitely not that I don't want to sell the house - I think it's that we're renovating every single room, putting new flooring in everywhere, redoing the bathrooms, all new appliances, painting every wall - it is overwhelming for sure, which has been part of my problem - and that's why I have on my list such small tasks as "remove casing on pantry doors" and "remove (one) tile on kitchen backsplash.   Autofocus came at exactly the right time for me because I was feeling so overwhelmed and kind of depressed at the enormity of the job that I couldn't start, much less finish anything.  Fortunately (for me), my son was laid off at the beginning of January, so I can delegate a lot of the work to him.  The main factor is probably that after working for 9 hours a day, I don't want to come home and work some more for another 3 hours.  <br><br>Walking the dog doesn't appear on the list because that's an *everyday must* - like brushing your teeth for other people I guess.<br><br>After I saw Mark's video, it confirmed that I started off working the system exactly how he shows in the video, so I've got the system down right - it's starting the system off / continuing it that's a problem for me.<br><br>I absolutely agree that I don't have enough fun things to do on the list - and some of what I put on the list that *should* and *would* be fun (eg. going swimming, playing Wii with my son, watching a DVD) - isn't actually all that fun for me.  Don't get me wrong, I have made much more progress using this method than any other, including DIT.<br><br>I write the date down beside my completed items (to track where I'm at in the list and provide documentation) and when I look back, it seems like I have flurries of activity - then nothing for days.  I have a total of about 500 tasks in my book with 16 active pages, with 63 tasks already dismissed - primarily due to the timing being wrong for them.  Starting on 1/5, I have the following stats (this is just my home book, I didn't start using the system until last week at work b/c I was in training and my time really wasn't my own):<br>0 tasks done - 5 days<br>1-5 tasks done - 26 days<br>6-10 tasks done - 2 days<br>11-15 tasks done - 4 days<br>16-20 tasks done - 3 days<br>and 1 day of 28 tasks completed - whoohoo!<br><br>ALL of my high output days are either Saturday and / or Sunday, where I start working around 8 a.m. and finish at about 11 a.m.   So for a total of ~240 tasks in the last 43 days, I'm only doing about 5 / day on average.  And my tasks do range from 2 minutes to an hour or so, lots ranging from 10-30 minutes.  My total tasks completed is a long way from Mark's numbers, but I've been very happy with the days that I've done 10 or more.  <br>My thinking time is every morning between 6-7 a.m., but I don't write stuff like that on my list as it's a normal routine where I review my list, plan my finances, read the blogs I subscribe to, most of which I don't have written on my list because it's part of a routine.<br>I don't know, maybe part of the "problem" is that I don't appear to have as much discretionary time as many others seem to.  Some people on this list seem to have written dozens, if not hundreds of posts - there's no way I could find the time to do that !   (Although their input has been very valuable to me and others.)<br><br>In reviewing what I've written, I think I should develop a routine to work on my home lists for 1/2 hour MAX in my free time between 7:30-8:00 p.m.  It's amazing what can get done in a small amount of time like that.  Not enough time to resent it, but enough to get something done.  Maybe I should even set my crackberry alarm to go off to remind me to start - and to finish...   :-)<br><br>I think it was Stephen Covey who told his daughter after she had a baby and she was having problems getting her goals completed - throw away your daytimer and to-do list, your priority is that baby - and for now that's all you should worry about.  I feel that way about my 8 y.o. son, and I'd like to start developing some tasks where we can work together for a little while rather than my zoning out with a book after 11 hours away from home...<br><br><br><br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br><br>Wow - you're certainly keeping busy!  It does sound as if you're using the "little and often" approach from the amount of time you spend on your tasks. Although my first thought on reading the number of tasks was that that was not many, when you clarified the actual amount of time those tasks were completed in, it does sound about right.  Therefore, as you say, does seem that the "problem" is that you are not "using" the system enough.<br><br>Two things come to mind.  Firstly, are you enjoying using AF?  I find, regardless of the actual tasks I am doing, that I really enjoy my AF time, because everything I do is what I want to do and when I want to do it.  Therefore, that time is "fun" time and there is no resistance.  That makes me wonder what the resistance is to "using the system" and whether perhaps there is a misunderstanding as to how things are standing out?<br><br>The other thought is whether you are still doing certain tasks when you feel you "ought" to.  Obviously some things (walking the dog, feeding the family etc) do need to be done at fairly set times, but you seem to be doing a number of time discretionery tasks outside of AF.  Consequently that limits what you see as your discretionery time and AF is a system that works with discretionery time other than scheduled time.  I use AF in virtually all of my discretionery time, BUT it is essential to include time for rest and leisure items.  If you are out of the house for 11 hours then you jolly well need "zoning out with book" on your list! Just try adding some of those routines onto your list - even if you have a "routine" that they are on every page.  I have certain tasks that I automatically put on each page (check email, thinking time, make coffee, check blog).  Sometimes they jump out and sometimes they don't, but it does ensure that they are kept in mind and that they are actioned as part of the system.  If your 6-7am tasks were written on your lists, then all you have to do is open your notebook at 6:00 am (makes me feel tired already!) and you are off and running ..........<br><br>Just a few more thoughts .......:-)</div>

<div class="content">Well, it's 6 a.m. and I did get one of my tasks done this morning before sitting down for my "me time" - take out the garbage - since it's garbage pick-up day.  I can't say that I *wanted* to do it though - heck, it's -15 outside.  But I did want to start with a quick 5 minute win to start the day off right.  And to do that, I tricked myself by looking ahead and doing tasks on pages until I stopped on the page that was right before take out garbage.<br><br>It appears to me that you and I may have very different items on our lists Christine.  Many of my tasks are things that I do want to do (buy DS carrier), but I also have many on there that I either don't really want to do (like clean the dog doo in the yard) - that I'm using the system to *force* me to do, or am neutral about the actual doing (pull up carpet tacks in living room).  I may be neutral about doing them, but not happy about the time that they take to do when I'd rather be reading.<br><br>Ah well, off to do another thing that I want to do - start my taxes - if only because I have a big refund coming...   :-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br><br>I don't have clear dog doo on my list so you are definitely correct on that point :-)<br><br>I don't think it's the type of items we have - I have a lot of items that I really do not enjoy doing and could not have imagined "wanting" to do.  Tasks like cleaning the bathroom, cleaning the oven (even worse!) and tax returns are tasks that I would consider unpleasant by any stretch of the imagination.  However, with AF I have actually found myself genuinely feeling like doing them and actually enjoying the process.  (Weird or what?!)  That is part of the "standing out" process, as opposed to only having "nice" tasks on the list and it does still seem as though this could be where your resistance is......?  I did find that I had to do a fair bit of self evaluation as to why I was resisting some things though ....<br><br>If you have time take look at the FAQ's - some of the posts on "standing out" may be of help <br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/645945" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/645945</a><br><br>-15 - ugh - sounds drastic!</div>

Whether it's a nice task or a nasty task, it just has that feeling about it that it's ready to be done.<br><br>I'm sure even clearing up the dog doo gets to the stage where it's ready to be done! :-)</div>

<div class="meta">2009-02-18 22:36</div>
<div class="content">Mark, I do get that "ready to be done" feeling quite often - about 75% of the time and the other 25% is a feeling of "just get the darn thing over with, it's not such a big deal like you used to make it out to be".  I believe that for me, going through the items multiple times - possibly up to 30 times or more (since I read my list for entertainment sometimes) - robs the ugly tasks of negative emotion / minimizes them.   I think there's some NLP at work there somehow.  I guess it becomes a situation not of "I want to clean up dog doo" to "I want to have a clean yard, and right now it's sunny out and not too cold and besides, I can stop whenever I want / feel like it so let's get to it ! "<br><br>You're right Mary, I think I'm not so much physically exhausted as mentally (no sunlight doesn't help!)  Starting a new job can be stressful and last month I was finding myself exhausted every day around 3 p.m.  This month has been much better.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-02-19 11:38</div>
<div class="content">Jacqueline<br><br>That mental exhaustion can be significantly more draining than physical exhaustion. I find I am actually sleeping significantly less than before I started AF.  Feeing that I had a big black amorphous cloud hanging over me full of "hundreds of things to do" was so draining.  Now I "know" I have hundreds of things to do, but I know what they are, where they are and that I CAN do them (or choose not to!)  I can see that I have cleared 831 tasks since starting AF so the remaining 423 is nothing!<br><br>It's fascinating too how that task resistance really does reduce as the items on a page get cleared.</div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline<br><br>From a logical viewpoint you may well want to do things but your subconscious mind always knows what is best.<br><br>You are tired and unable to just crack on with things for a reason.  Acknowledge your feelings and go with the flow.  Do not try to push against the current.  It will make you more exhausted.  It may not always seem like it but everything will happen at the right time and people will appear when you need them.  Believe this and pat yourself on the back when you make even the slightest progress on your list.  I think you are being far too hard on yourself!<br><br>Caroline</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the kind words Caroline, I know I have Type A tendencies at times and I am very productive and focused at work, which makes me want to push myself at times outside of work.  <br>On a positive note, last night I cleared off 2 tasks in my home notebook, clearing another page that had only one outstanding item (declutter my home office desk), which felt good - and I didn't even finish that one item, only worked on it for about 15 minutes, but it did feel good to get a start at least.  <br>I have that need to feel I've earned my time off from work - and I still got to read Stephen Pressfield's Virtues of War (not on the list, although it could have been) because my other task was to go pick up my holds at the library.  :-)<br>I've still accomplished more on my home renovation project using AF in the last 6 weeks than I did in the 4 years previously so AF has been a success for me thus far.  I'm eternally grateful to Mark for sharing his insights with us all.  <br>I should also note that it's been great starting a new job off on the same day that Mark released AF.  Not only am I starting with no backlog but I look like a superstar already only 6 weeks in.  Especially since the person I'm replacing and am in training with has been off this week with the flu and I've been able to follow the system without any interference.  I think she works by just responding to her email, while I have mine shut off until I come to it in my notebook.  No wonder she doesn't understand why I'm always so calm at work, I couldn't focus with being distracted a hundred times a day.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline,<br><br>I have been participating in the Beta since the 5th Jan and this is unquestionably the best time management system I've ever used in terms of reducing procrastination; but I still procrastinate like you wouldn't believe! All the Myers Briggs threads have got me thinking it's a personality trait rather than a bad habit, and there's nothing to be gained from shouting at myself for it. I wouldn't shout at myself if I were crippled, so why should I punish myself just because the disability is psychological? I just need to accept it and manage it.<br><br>With regard to practical suggestions for your not wanting to 'get the file out', I find leaving the AF notebook open on its active page on my coffee table is the best solution - if I want a cup of tea or a glass of wine, I'm going to see that list whether I want to or not.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi little b, <br>I think you have something there as that's what I do at work and it works for me to have it right there open on my desk.  I carry my home book in my purse so that I can write in things to do during the day as they occur, or knock off a couple of tasks during lunch.  I will have to make it a routine to take my notebook out of my purse as soon as I get home - right on my kitchen counter where I spend most of my time.   When it hides in my purse it's easy to ignore.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Caroline,<br><br>Initially I had one section for work and one for home, then realized that for the first time ever, I really wanted to - and this is the right environment to do so - leave work at work for once.  (Plus I found myself in meetings going over my home list and listing tasks etc.)  This is my last year before I early retire and my contract here is up Dec. 31.  It's taken me until now (I'm 43) to learn how to set boundaries and have some kind of work-life balance and I want to do what I can to support that. <br><br>In my previous job, I was responsible for process improvement and training - I have found that most innovative ideas I've had for process improvements have come while I've been out camping for the weekend (usually the 2nd day, the first day is decompression) or on holiday.  Those ideas led to work for a whole team of people being divided in half.  Insights definitely don't come when you're busy doing, doing, doing.  So I guess that says something too for not being stressed about not having my book open all the time and letting myself always get pulled into it.<br></div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline<br><br>I think you've realley hit a very large nail on the head with your last para.  One of the things I find with AF is the fact that, because it frees your mind up, it is possible to think more clearly.  In the past I would have had many of my productive ideas when I could just go away somewhere and think, and like you found that time was needed to get to that point (the 2nd day effect).  With family commitments being such over the past few years that I could not get away, I really felt as If had actually lost the ability to have creative ideas anymore.  Now I can be creative - I can have that "thinking time" and be creative without getting away, or perhaps it is that I can now "get away from it all" mentally even if not physically.   Of course now my next step is to find a way to get away physically as well :-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine, <br><br>I was thinking of another point about resistance (and creativity) that I haven't seen mentioned.  Regarding high-resistance tasks too, I don't really look at the "whys" of why I'm resisting them, I've made a little check-list in my mind of:<br><br>- how can I get this done without ME doing it? <br>- is there another solution that I find more pleasant that will deliver the result?<br>- does it REALLY need to be done?<br>- is there a way that I can make the doing of it more fun?<br>- is there a way I can change the process so it gets done really fast?<br><br>It leads to all sorts of great solutions like being one of the earliest adopters of the Roomba (AND Scooba! :-) (didn't like vacuuming, but I love watching that little thing work while I read), xeriscaping, self-watering plants, linked spreadsheets, and now AF...<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br><br>That sounds like a great approach to those household tasks.  I have to confess to having looked at the robot vaccuums myself but had never heard the term xeriscaping.  I need to find a way to make my plants self sufficient - I'm not a lot of use to them - but perhaps AF will change that .... :-)</div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline,<br><br>It sounds like some of the advice you've gotten here has really helped, but I want to point out one thing that struck me as I read this thread. You clearly have a lot of anxiety over the home renovation project, and furthermore, you seem to equate taking out your AF notebook with doing that project (or other tasks you need to "force" yourself to do). It's no wonder you don't want to take it the notebook out!!<br><br>It may help you to add many different kinds of tasks to your list, even those you do daily. That would accomplish two things:<br>(1) You have less resistance to opening the notebook, knowing that there are many tasks in there that you might enjoy. Follow the system to the letter for a few days: allow yourself to do only the tasks you FEEL like doing. Trust that, eventually, you will feel like doing even those home renovation tasks. And don't forget that rewriting a task counts as working on it!<br>(2) A little trick: If you do something you know is on the list, such as walking the dog (which you do anyway), you may be more apt to take out your notebook and cross that task off. (For the feeling of accomplishment :-) ). That could make you feel you are working on AF, so you might as well find the next task to do! <br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Almond,<br><br>I'm not sure how to implement your suggestions.  I don't want to put some of my routines into AF because well, they're routine.  Plus I would find it highly unlikely that they would show up on my active page at the right time.  I don't want to be making coffee when I'm walking out the door, you know what I mean?  I also look at it this way - I have a separate AF book for work.  I don't write in there "visit with so and so for 10 minutes" or any other fun stuff.  It's work, right?   When I want a break / to go for a coffee with someone,  I just go, come back to my AF list and keep rolling.  <br><br>There's a lot of the home reno tasks that I do want to do (I'm pawning the ugly ones off on contractors and my son), they just take a fairly large block of time (eg. painting / laying hardwood floor).  So I don't want to start them on weekdays.  Just getting the book out and committing myself to doing JUST ONE TASK (per unit of discretionary time - a.m. and evg.) has been very helpful.  Just one in the morning, because that's all I have time for, and as much as I feel like in the evening, as long as I do one.  <br><br>What I have been doing though, is spending my weekdays (M-F) primarily on the last 2 pages of my book (where the small tasks are residing) and using my weekends when I have more discretionary time to go through the whole cycle of pages.   I've only been trying this for the last 2 weeks and it's been working.  Rome wasn't cleaned in a day...<br><br>Another thing I did was to take the "control journal" - this is from Flylady.net for cleaning, and listed out all the tasks that I had on there on my AF list.  I think by the very nature of AF, it will automatically sort these tasks into daily / weekly / monthly format.  It brought me up to 23 active pages though - eek!  Lots of very small tasks to draw me in and seem non-threatening (wash switch plates - all of 1 minute!)  I'm proud to say that my kitchen counters have been spotless all week!  I feel like a freak - I just shined my sink.  Another success was that I took my garbage out 3 days early - thank heavens, because on garbage day when I'm always scrambling, it was -30.  Also been making my son's lunch every evening - less stress in the morning, and frees up time for me to do an AF task.  I already mentioned on another post that I arranged all of my outfits for the next 2 weeks, so things are moving along in a much more effortless fashion.  All this from *just get the book out.*<br><br>Another thing that's helped is that I follow my 'task sandwich' method of:  AF task - fun thing - AF task - repeat.  Fun thing - like this post - just a paragraph, so it draws me back in to finish, which draws me to an AF task, and so on.  Others would say that I should have the fun thing listed in my AF book, but I tried that and I would see "read XXX book" and that would draw me into a black hole of unproductivity for the rest of the night.  I know myself, and I think I've worked with this task sandwich method for so long that I strangely naturally gravitate towards it whenever I work.  It's not broken, so I'm not going to try to fix it.<br><br>(Apologies for the length of the post, but I was getting a lot of AF tasks done - 5 paragraphs, 5 tasks - whoot!)<br><br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline,<br><br>From reading your post, it looks like you have already implemented what I had in mind! Sorry if I was unclear.<br><br>My main point was that if your book is filled with just home renovation tasks, you will resist opening it because you equate the AF book with your home renovation project. If you fill it with other tasks, you have a greater variety of tasks to choose from. Thus you are more likely to open the book and read through the tasks, and if you read the tasks often enough you will eventually feel like doing one of them. I only suggested routine tasks in case you couldn't think of anything else :-)<br><br>I also do not put break activities on my AF list (I don't need an excuse to "make coffee" instead of doing actual tasks!)<br><br>Glad to see you have broken through your resistance! I might try your task sandwich method sometime.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Almond, the task sandwich concept comes from Don Gabor's "Big Things Happen When You Do the Little Things Right".   It could be useful for people who want to identify goals to work towards, as long as they come back to AF to get them accomplished!<br><br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Things-Happen-When-Little-Right/dp/0761505350" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Things-Happen-When-Little-Right/dp/0761505350</a><br></div>

<div class="content">A nudge to get the book out for me lately has been to pull it out as soon as I get home and see if there's anything that I've done during the day (or my son has done for me while I've been gone at work!) that I can possibly cross off.  That's working to pull me into the book and to start me off with a feeling of accomplishment right away.<br></div>

<div class="content">What size is your notebook and where do you keep it? I've been using two A5 notbooks, one for work that stays at work, and one for "home" that I kept in my bag and took out when I felt productive.<br><br>Last weekend I switched to using a very small pocket notebook for home tasks (about 3" x 2"). I treat each 2-page "spread" as a page in the system, and fit around 17 items on a spread. It's small enough to keep in my pocket at all times, and I keep a pen in my pocket too.<br><br>This made a MASSIVE difference to me this weekend. Every time I found myself pausing and wondering what to do next, I would whip out my notebook and pick a task. I had a very productive Saturday, and it never felt like hard labour at all.<br><br>The physical task of getting my book out, and sitting down to leaf through it put me in a lethargic frame of mind. As I was sitting down to read the notebook, it was too tempting to stay sitting down and surf the net or read a novel.<br><br>One thing that really helps with AF is the freedom to give up a task when you're tired of it.  This is especially important with house care, because you want your home to serve YOU and not the other way around.<br><br>If you have the notebook on you all the time then if you feel the temptation to waste time (and you know in your heart that you will regret the waste), then write the temptation down as an item: "read a bit of that trashy novel", "surf the net". Often the act of writing it down is all you need to move on from the temptation. And you know that you'll have the option to do it once you reach that page.</div>

<div class="content">Believe it or not, one of the items on my task list IS to clean up my community's dog doo in the off-leash park we frequent.  It will be *ready* to do as soon as the temperatures reach between -3C and +3C for about 4 consecutive days.  Still frozen but loosened from the ice is the ready state I'm looking for. :-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi David,<br>You always give such good advice!  My book is 5x8.5. I like the idea of a small book that can be carried with me constantly, but I don't think clothing manufacturer's think of practicality like that when it comes to women.  Men have places for pens and papers and wallets - women just get a purse - and the ability to carry what won't fit in the man's pockets.<br><br>I've been finding that I have to take the book out of my purse as soon as I come home and on to the kitchen counter works.  It has to be done the minute I get home and I'm getting into a routine with that.  I start doing things while supper is cooking - the only unfortunate thing is that I occasionally overcook things because I'm absorbed in the task - I'll have to learn to start using my timer more diligently.  :-)  Then I do a quick check-in with my son and see what he's done while I've been gone at work - then I do a scan through the pages to see what I can cross off my list that he's done.  Then I go back to my active page.  The book lives on my kitchen counter on weekends as I'm in and out of there most of the time - right by the coffee pot - maybe that's why my weekend mornings are so productive!<br>On weekend afternoons,  I go through the list, pulling off the things I need to go buy and transferring them to a small piece of paper - yes, I'm doing that out of order, but it wouldn't be as efficient as running out to buy something every time it appears on the list.  I live in a bedroom community, so running out to pick something up isn't very convenient.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hmm. <br><br>I sense a need for the "Autofocus (TM) A4 notebook on a string" - ever ready, with a wide range of covers to match every occasion and environment....<br><br>Oops should have been in "Making Money Out of Autofocus". <br><br>Sorry, Mark. Still, I feel your well deserved millions are now secure.</div>
