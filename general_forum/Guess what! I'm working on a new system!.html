<div class="content">I just thought everyone would like to know that I am working on a new time management system. It uses an old idea of mine which I've realised can be vastly improved by adding some of what I've discovered through developing DIT and AF.<br><br>I am not going to call it AF5 as it doesn't use the single AF list which has been the common feature of AFs 1-4.<br><br>It will take at least a month to test it to my own satisfaction, but I am hopeful that it will finally solve all time management issues for evermore. :-)</div>

<div class="content">«I am hopeful that it will finally solve all time management issues for evermore.»  <br><br>Suuure. ;-)<br><br>No, seriously, I'm looking forward to seeing what you come up with this time. Even if I have to start rewriting my applications again (and again).<br><br>It will be interesting to observe the reactions to a new system, especially if it deviates considerably from the AF formula, which has a strong following by now.</div>

<div class="content">Andreas:<br><br><< It will be interesting to observe the reactions to a new system, especially if it deviates considerably from the AF formula >><br><br>It does include some of the features of AF and some of the features of DIT too. It is slightly more complicated than any of the AF versions - though not greatly so.<br><br>One of the features of DIT which it brings back is the concept of being able to say that you've done all the work you need to do for that day It also keeps the dismissal concept from AF.</div>

<div class="content">Same here for the paper notebook: thanks to AF I've been working on paper for a year now (and loving it!), and that's a personal record for me. Before AF, I would keep switching systems and implementations and tweaking ad nauseam.<br><br>BTW, I'm curious to hear how the concept of a days work will work out in the new system, because that's what I really liked about DIT. Good luck with the testing!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Nicole,<br><br>Me too!  I used to do everything in Outlook and would tweak constantly.  Not that there is anything bad about wanting to improve one's system....but I would find myself doing so much work on my system that it was time I could have been getting work done!  That is why I like the simplicity of AF4 so much....I concentrate on my work.<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>I am interested in the new system as I have found that with an overwhelming job  with masses of  tiny things to do, and things that must be done by the end of the day, that I have adapted AF as part of a wider system using components from your earlier books.  <br><br>It has three parts: (1) daily tasks (DTs) which need to be done daily   by personality I would not tidy my desk, check my answer phone each day which helps me when I do it little and often.<br>(2) Autofocus 4 list and <br>(3) Must Dos (MDs) things that have to be done for the end of  the day (i know I could do them rotating at the end of the open list but I have preferred to have them as a closed list.<br><br>I begin with the most basic daily tasks and then I have a closed list of  three items: Daily tasks, must dos (another closed list) and AF.   WHat is most interesting is how I intuitively vary the amount of  time I spend on each of the three categories.  <br>My DTs are like "sweeping the runway"  they just have to be done<br>My MDs remind me of  what has to get done by the end of the day & saves me getting lost in my AF list.<br>My AF  list helps me keep everything moving and gives me permission to unction in the nonurgent.<br><br>I have been doing AF since the beginning, but found mysel getting lost in it.  I just love my current system and will use it and adapt it until my situaiton changes or I ind another tweak that helps.  <br><br>Thanks or all the books and the blog.  The meta teaching of  AF is keep learning and develop your own way.  I would say that how people respond depends on whether they want to implement a particular system or whether they want to implement the deeper teaching  of  yours which is learning and experimenting or yourselF <br><br><br>Mike</div>

<div class="content">'The new system should cope very nicely with your three parts'<br><br>That's great to know! Mark, as we have exchanged on the forum before, I have also been running a system very similar to Mike J so that I could incorporate the bits I loved about DIT and AF4. So await this with great interest.<br><br>'Bigger as in A4 minimum with room for two columns. The Collins Diary I am using has 48 lines to a page, which with two columns gives room for 96 tasks. I'm hoping that will be enough.'<br><br>On that point, I currently use an A5 diary for tasks and a small Moleskin notebook for my AF4 list. I particularly love the portability of the notebook and the fact that I have one very easy point of reference that I can refer to when, say, I am on the train or at the coffee shop. Whilst I do have a huge handbag, I think I would cause myself an injury if I had to cart around a large A$ format, so I'm hoping very much that you'll still have an element of portability which runs alongside the diary?<br><br>Great to have you back with us and, clearly, I must get out more as I am overly excited about the unvieling of the new system. If an Andreas style demo would be difficult, could you consider a 'Tara type' video? These visual aids really bring the instructions to life.<br><br>With best wishes</div>

<div class="content">Great news, Mark - this is very exciting.  You can tell by the posts on this thread that we're creatures that love the prospect of a new shiny system.<br><br>Funnily enough, I posted a couple of days ago on the "Ping-pong" thread that I sometimes used the DIT will-do list in conjunction with AF4, and it sounds as if others are doing something similar.  You do realise, don't you, that having announced this work-in-progress,  people will pester you, wanting to know about it before your month-long testing is complete??!!    (I, for one, promise not to pester).  A few weeks ago, someone mentioned that the forum had gone rather quiet, possibly because AF4 was working so well.  It'll be great to have the posts coming fast and furious again.<br><br>I've followed Autofocus from the beginning when it was just a gleam in your eye, and it was on this day one year ago that I started to use it, so today feels like a bit of a celebration.  <br><br>Best wishes for the development of the new system (you could call  it Phoenix, as it rises from the ashes of DIT and Autofocus - or perhaps not, as that implies that both DIT and Autofocus crashed and burned).</div>

<div class="content">An interesting thing has happened while testing my new system. I realised that if I simplified it a bit, it would make an ideal amendment to DIT. So I'm now trying it out from that perspective. <br><br>In particular I'm hoping that it will have the following effects:<br><br>1) Make the concept of "one day's work in one day" easier to achieve.<br><br>2) Make the system more flexible.<br><br>3) Better handling of days on which one can't finish all the tasks.<br><br>4) The "audit" procedure becomes automatic.<br><br>What I'm doing basically is to apply some of the things I've learned from AF to DIT. <br><br>I'm still on day one, but I'm hoping for great things!</div>

<div class="content">I can easily make two columns per page on my standard, spiral-bound notebook -- and date the page at the top.

If it works well for you, of course.<br><br>I am really intrigued by your DIT2 list  having so many tasks on it, particularly since you are designing a way such that one will know when they have completed one day's work.

Today I have only three tasks left to do (as at 11.55 a.m.).

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>SO many tasks....I am intrigued....what kind of diary are you using that allows so many entries on one day?  I am assuming since this is DIT2 that each page is a day of the week.  I had said before that I hope to be able to use my current AF4 notebook or something similar.  Oh....one more question....in DIT the default was that tasks that came in....unless they were same-day urgent....went on tomorrow's list.  And you had said that one should not spread tasks out over a period of time because it defeated a principle of DIT of knowing how much work you really have on your plate.  Is DIT2 going to have the same principle? <br><br>-David</div>

And you had said that one should not spread tasks out over a period of time because it defeated a principle of DIT of knowing how much work you really have on your plate. Is DIT2 going to have the same principle? >><br><br>More or less, yes.</div>

<div class="content">Just another vote of support for a DIT2.  I love the book and some of the principles really speak to me: the idea that if you don't do it tomorrow, when will you do it?  And the concept of being "done".  In practice, I have found it difficult to implement because my days tend to be a little irregular (work-at-home Dad) and so I've tried to keep the principles but apply it more to the week-level instead of day-level.  I will be very excited to see your new take on this!</div>

<div class="content">With the different AF versions, it seemed like someone would post a "tweak" of some kind, or maybe identify a limitation in the current version.  That would spark something in Mark's mind, and he'd go off and sequester himself for a couple weeks.  He'd then emerge with a new system that elegantly solved whatever limitations were there before, and sometimes you could see the grains of the ideas that other people had proposed, but Mark had taken those grains, and put them into use in such a clean, elegant, intuitive way, that it looked like a whole new approach.  Which indeed it was.  There are so many "tidbits" of time management wisdom that we all carry around with us.  Mark is THE expert at integrating those tidbits into a working coherent system.  Plus he always came up with a few new tidbits that no one else had thought of...  <br><br>So, here is my guess...  I think ping-pong had something to do with it.  Maybe the new system is something like this:<br><br>1.  You use a daily diary book.<br><br>2.  New tasks are added to tomorrow's diary page.<br><br>3. You start the day by looking at today's page.  You process it in "AF1" fashion -- read through the list once, and then go back to the top and carefully go down through each item.  Do whatever stands out.  Work on it as long as you want.  Keep cycling through the page till nothing stands out.<br><br>4. Then go back to the earliest diary page that still has open tasks on it.  Process them in "AF1" fashion.  When nothing stands out, you can either move forward to the next diary page with tasks still on it, or jump forward to "today".  <br><br>5. For all old pages, "dismissal rules" are in effect.  When you come to the page, if nothing stands out, it all gets "dismissed".  Not sure how that would be handled.  Maybe whenever you do a dismissal like that, you should add a new task on tomorrow's page to "review dismissed items".<br><br>6.  During the day, as new tasks arise, they normally would go on tomorrow's task list.  If it genuinely is something that CAN'T be started till some time in the future, then write it on the diary page for the earliest day when you can start on it.  If it is something that MUST be done TODAY, then draw a line at the bottom of today's task list, and start adding the new urgent items below that line.<br><br><br>So, Mark, is my guess anything close to what you've got in the works?  :-)</div>

<div class="content">To have a new DIT is Interesting.  <br>In my DIT days I went for a weekly notebook ( 8 sheets, self made with a sewing machine, paper and cardboard, moleskine cahier like) Each day on two pages, weekend as one day and a last page for tasks that will be done after the current week.<br>I entered tasks all over the week,  not just tomorrow. It was something like Do It (mostly) this Week.  At the end of the week there was a GTD like review where the notebook was replaced by a new one.  <br>It is interesting to see if the new DIT can offer AF like list handling for tasks that did not make the day and are still hanging undone.</div>

<div class="content">Wow, I dozed off for a bit and the world is changing ;-)<br><br>Oh, wait, it is January so this all makes sense now.  ;-)  Great to see that retirement has not meant that you stopped working with systems.  I'm interested to see if you go back to a paged based system (a la AF1) and if you carry forward the AF1 type of dismissal rules.  With dated pages it seems as if that is where this is going, though I suppose you could circulate through previous days pages for an AF4 effect.  The possibilities are endless ;-)<br><br>I had recently tweaked my AF4 composition book based system (I never did get back to my pocket format and I've got mixed feelings about that, damn it ;-) to include a "diary" component to it.  Nothing earth shaking ... I just drew a vertical line and use the right side of each page for dated notes.  I did not think to use a separate page for each day because I don't normally add 25 new tasks each day.  I suppose if I did move to a page-a-day system I could revert back to my pocket book as I'd have more room.  Hmmm... remains to be seen.<br><br>Anyway, I'm waiting with baited breath to see what this new system is like.  If past is prologue, this should be fascinating.<br><br>Oh, and +1 for an Andreas type demo, if that makes any sense at all.  I can't tell you how crystal clear that simply watching the system unfold over the course of a day (compressed to a few minutes) with annotations made it so much easier to understand than any written instructions.</div>

<div class="content">But Avrum, AF _does_ help you with your taxes.  It tells you to write "Plan to do Taxes" on your list.  When AF tells you it's time to plan, follow Barbara's other piece of advice: Pull out a sheet of paper and map out the things that are necessary to complete your taxes.  <br><br>Perhaps the first thing in your plan is to gather papers related to your taxes.  Add to your plan (A) filling in forms, or (B) hiring someone to fill in forms.  Add a few more details to your plan.<br><br>So following AF you planned your work.  Rephrase your task to "Work on Taxes".  Then following AF and your above plan you actually do the work.  If it's onerous, follow Mark's advice to just do a little bit.<br><br>The only way this can fail is if when the system says do a little bit, and you know it needs doing, and you know it's only a small thing, then you decide not to do anything.</div>

Be aware of the benefits, the agony, the things you mightt do instead, the effect on self-image, positives and negatives.  Now you're fully aware of the consequences of action and of inaction.

My tax situation is complex and I dread it.  The only way it works for me is to get under the gun then work full out until it is done.  It usually takes a full two days, including digging up paperwork.  The tax it self is not the problem... you just get a copy of TurboTax and plug in the information.  The problem can be in distilling the information.  Not a big thing for W-2s or 1099s, but if you own property and have rents, expenses, etc. that can take a while to compile.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mike<br>This is precisely why I have my scut cap and use my timer. It forces me to both do the dreaded scut ......and.........wisely choose what scut I'm going to focus on!  LOL!  I've got my scut down to 90minutes daily cap and 6 hours weekly cap.  Getting over the hump with a carefully distilled scut list makes the rest of my work infinitely more pleasurable to do because the scut cap keeps the dread sensations at bay!  LOL!  Before I created my scut cap methodology, I was mired in too much "optional" scut.  Who needs that?<br><br>Hi Avrum<br>I could never stay current or slightly ahead without my timer!  The default setting is 15minutes but I can set it to 2minutes, 5minutes, etc in hopes of launching myself into a high anxiety/high resistance task.  If it works, great.  If not, do it again and again until you've completed the total amount of scut you need to accomplish to feel OK to enjoy your other work.  I also use this to complete tasks while in pain.  I set the timer according to my resistance level and I set the total amount according to staying current enough to avoid dread and nagging sensations.  Those interfere horribly against creative flow!<br><br>  Heck, Avrum......When it's something particularly onerous and particularly important (such as taxes ;>0....) I'll set up another work station just for it and do it piecemeal between the other work.  The low timer settings are your safety cap.....but....secretly, I'm hoping that the launch takes hold and I wind up doing a decent chunk of it!  At the least, dodging the taxes will prey on your creative resources and your overall approach to doing your work.<br>Doing a few short stints of it between your other stuff will at least keep the thing moving a bit forward rather than turn into a horrible, mood and energy guzzling NAG MONSTER!
