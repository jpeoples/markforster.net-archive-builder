<div class="content">I have tried a new system this week which is inspired from MF systems I wanted to share with you. <br><br>It works on paper and it is simple. It needs 3 tools <br>1. A paper notes book for notes <br>2. A pad for tasks<br>3. A computer for projects<br><br>The idea was simple. I had many information anywhere and I needed to collect it and act on them easily. Little by little I am looking for simplification. <br><br>Here is how I do<br>1. My spiral A4 paper Note book is for notes, ideas. I drop there what I may need to follow. I use it to take note when I call people. I have many calls per day. At night I summarize all the day. I may find new buildings, new clients, new ideas. It helps me to clean my incoming stuff. <br><br>2. My pad has weekly pages and one page for the core informations<br>At the end of the week on wednesday I start a new page. ie june 2013 monday 10th to sunday 16 th. each page has 2 column left is for incoming stuff, write is for following stuff (often unfinished). Each column is treated with FV method I alway begin by the write one (following stuff). Each page is written on the 2 sides. It's better for the environment ;-)<br>One page is reserved for my business list where all business negotiation is reported 'write column) left colum is for bigs rock I intend to do in the next 2 months. <br><br>3. Computer files are for following projects and people. I drop information in each .txt files in folders, i will need later ie proposals, negotiations. It often comes from my paper note book in summary. It also contains information I may need to decide. <br><br>The system has only one week. It is OK for the moment. <br>I notice that when I work on my weekly list I cross a lot and report my stuff the next week page I create mostly during the week. I also notice that my information are very up to date. I dont treat information over 2 weeks. If there is something important I will create a weekly list and put it in my tickler for the future or it will go in my diary. <br><br>As you see the system is bases on MF ideas. AF, FV, SF, current initiative which are reported at the end of the list when finished, but also parts of others methods. I like it because it is on paper and it keep information up to date. I did not want for next week use a . txt files for I have a better feeling with paper. Tell me your thoughts about this <br>Best to you all</div>
