<div class="content">My digital page consists of 27 tasks each and currently I have 12 pages with 3 pages either completed or dismissed.<br><br>I have been circulating through 3 tasks on a very difficult page 4, eager to dismiss it, rephrase or just do it. I got 2 of them done, leaving a task I was avoiding due to the sheer volume of very mundane actions. (the end result was very important, though).<br><br>So, today, having gathered all the material to begin the task (I guess that was the initial break down of my resistance to it), I ploughed through it in about 3 hours. I finished the boring actions, leaving me with one follow up task that would produce the end result.<br><br>What a feeling of release! The thing is, today was a day I stopped circulating through the AF pages when I hit the task on page 4 and put all my energies into it. <br><br>I have another very important project on my plate (moving office), with multiple sets of actions on my AF list, but the completion of this huge task has motivated me to meet the leftover project tasks with energy and vigour. I breezed through many of the project actions after that.<br><br>AF is indeed amazing, and the more trust I put to it, the more it pays me back in terms of productive time spent in sometimes very unplanned ways.<br><br>I am eager to get some of my goal oriented actions tagged on to my AF lists, as it has proven to be robust yet malleable and structured yet fluid.<br><br>Thanks Mark for all you have done to bring this to us.</div>

<div class="content">Hi JD<br><br>That's a really encouraging post.  I still can't quite believe myself how much of a difference AF makes......</div>

<div class="content">JD,<br>Thanks.  I'm finding very similar results.  Starting with AF this week, it's been easier to ensure that I've captured multiple tasks for several projects - things that could be done in parallel if I had the time.  The beauty is that getting them on the list and then reviewing each page gives me a chance to scan it and catch myself if any one of them pop out to do immediately.</div>

<div class="content">I've just had a wonderful experience how can I trust in AF. I was tense and getting nervous because of a task and indecision. Very old feelings came out. I put it in AF, called a person and asked her if I could rearrange things for next week as the deadline was approaching (tomorrow). And that worked! What a relief. The point is that I get the courage to face the situation and to ask for what would be the best for me instead of procrastinating and getting more  and more tense. It is possible to arrange things for tomorrow and I will try but without worry.<br><br> I have an appointment next week when people come back from vacation and I can rearrange things easily.<br><br>There is no magic, but in fact this approach which is fluid yet  structured as JD said 9 I change the order!) is the one that works for me. <br><br>I understand it may not work for some people I know. But now I can be as trustable as they are!</div>

<div class="content">Ops, a little bit confuse. If possible, I will give her the document tomorrow, if not, next week. It is been difficult to get the document because all people I can ask for are out of town.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Silvia<br><br>That's great that AF is working well for you in these areas.  It's amazing how we put off some of those phone calls that would make things easier.  One of the things I have identified with calls like that is that they are linked to a fear of conflict and that is something I will always try to avoid.  The ironic thing is that having the attitude of trying to avoid conflict "at all costs" is that we never actually question what that cost is or even whether it exists.  9 times out of 10, either there is no cost, or the cost of not making the call is actually greater in the long run than not making it!<br><br>One thing I have found since starting AF is that I am finding it a lot easier to say "no".  I feel I am making informed (even rational!) decisions about my time rather than just having all of my time decided for me.  That's not to say I haven't struggled with some major deadline issues this week, but I am working on them with far less stress than would have been possible and expect to complete everything on time - which I firmly believed was a total impossibility.  Amazing!  <br><br>p.s.  Thanks for all your help with the FAQ's - glad you liked the results!</div>

<div class="content">oops correction "the cost of not making the call is actually greater in the long run than making it!"<br></div>

<div class="content">Christine and Silvia:<br><br>Even though I've been using AF longer than anyone else I am still amazed at how effective it is. This week I've had several important deadlined work: two seminars in the course of the week which I've had to prepare; and getting a planning committee set up for an Arts Festival. I've found what I always find - if I try to buck the system I get panicky and start resisting the tasks. If I relax and trust the system, it delivers the work smoothly and effectively well in time.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark<br><br>I bet you're glad you didn't have to include Tax Return into the mix!  It's so encouraging to hear that the system continues to work for you; I've long suspected from your seminars and books that we work/struggle with Time Management issues in similar ways so if it works for you I have long term hope!<br><br>It's been a very interesting week for me - I've had major deadline stuff to do, and although I have had to deal with it partly outside of AF, simply because it falls under the common sense/do it now rule, I have still been able to incorporate it within the AF system and as a result have been so much more focused and so much less stressed (and still had time to visit the forum because that was my break when I had done "as much as I felt like").  My main frustration has been in not working so intensively with my lists, but I have been reviewing them, my mind has continued to work on them almost independently, and I know that when I get back to them there will be at least 20 items that I have completed as a matter of course because "it was the right time to do so".  <br></div>

<div class="content">Mark Forster,<br><br>I always remember your comment, the more you are using AF, the better you are doing.<br><br>More and more I am relying on it. It is no magic, it is me, free from many obstacles like those Christine mentions.<br><br>Plus, I should quote Seraphim because the same is happening to me:<br>I've found that certain habits, such as web surfing, TV, email chatter, just all disappear. I usually gravitate towards things like that when I'm feeling unsure of where to start with my "real" work. With AF it's always very clear where to start, and easy to get going, and I have found that I just haven't been doing the empty bad habits nearly as much.<br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/638216" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/638216</a><br><br>Soon people won't recognize me! or better, I won't recognize me!<br></div>

<div class="content">I am pretty amazed at how well AF works for everyone since I don't find it useful at all. I was hoping it would help me find a way to keep track and prioritize things at work but without a ranking system that is impossible for me. I've been making lists for years and did something like this a long time ago and have moved on to overall lists but having a daily list so I can make sure to accomplish specific things and not get too derailed by new things and putting out fires. Sometimes I even order it by times of the day.<br><br>I find that everything has a time limit of some sort, being shorter or longer and there is nothing that is safe to dismiss... it's all work that needs to get done. That's why it's work at a job. Perhaps I am just in the wrong type of place to use this system but I am glad that making lists seems to help so many people.</div>

<div class="content">Genevieve:<br><br>Sorry to hear AF doesn't work for you. Obviously no one system is going to suit everyone.<br><br>Just as a matter of interest, how long did you try it for?</div>

<div class="content">Genevieve : dismiss doesn't mean remove it forever - it is always  your choice :) <br><br>It just mean think twice before you write it down to the list again... cause apparently if item was dismissed there is a reason why you avoiding doing it.<br><br>And about time limits - for things with really sharp time limits like meeting - you still use calendar.<br><br>For all other things - I try to cycle through all you AF pages at least once a day, usually I do it few times - once a day every few hours - there is no way I miss something which is important that day :)<br><br>I guess you haven't try it...it's more than just simple list, my things are done more quickly and I avoid putting out fires this way .</div>
