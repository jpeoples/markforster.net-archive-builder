<div class="content">Hi Jacqueling<br>Talk about coincidences. The productiveflourishing website has a weekly planner that looks almost identical to what I use.  I also have my Current Initiative noted..  I use my calendar and checklists (my form of tickler system) to fill in Scheduled Events and Deadlines (non-projects such as Auto Inspection, Dental Exam, etc as well as for projects)<br>For focusing purposes, I do a daily list on a 5x8 index card that's portable (memory issues). I use a separate daily checklist of recurring daily stuff such as meds notations, etc.  The only real variation for the daily list is sometimes I'll add Mark's "What's better?" to refocus my attitude.<br>The checklists are now mostly because of memory issues.  They are still also used bor their benefit of streamlining the mundane and the non-negotiables.  Most of these things change very little if you stop and think about it.  It's the same idea as a tickler for recurring responsibilities such as bithdays, bills due, medical visits, Taxes due, etc...<br>I'm not trying to turn myself into neither a savant nor an automaton.  I'm simply trying to keep myself on my preferred trajectory.  I don't remember the post, but they were talking about personal goal setting as useless because life is fluid and unpredictable.  I'm a Bohemian at heart so I concur with part of it.  But when they mention famous people who happenstanced their successes, that is only partially true.  Goal setting and planning is more about keeping ourselves on our trajectory....similar to what you describe about your educational aims, house renovation/retirement aims......Everyone puts themselves on some sort of trajectory by the decisions they make.  Only an OCD would attempt to actually predict their future.  Trajectories are fluid, yeah. Based on what I can remember,  You're the only other person on this forum who lives spontaneously on her trajectory.  Open-mindedness, flexibility built into our plans, are part of intelligent planning.  I automate the obligations and streamline the mundane so that I CAN leap onto opportunities as they appear or set the mundane aside when I'm enjoying a creativity jag.  I LIVE for those!  LOL!<br>The url is <br><a href="http://www.productiveflourishing.com/wp-content/uploads/The_Freelancer_Workweek_-_Draft.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.productiveflourishing.com/wp-content/uploads/The_Freelancer_Workweek_-_Draft.pdf</a><br><br>Of course, plans are only trajectories....We WELCOME discoveries, unexpected opportunities , etc.  We're only aiming to do our part to set our own trajactories and plan to give ourselves plenty of freedom to leap on our passions and have the freedom to experience life as it unfolds.....without a part of our brain churning on about ignored work or what's is actually on my plate?  This mental chattering HOGS up precious cognitive energy!  LOL!  <br>And that's the perceived genious of my madness according to nobody except me!  LOL!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>Maybe it's not such a coincidence afterall.  Although I had a normal job, I also did lots of freelance work as well.  I also had lots of interests, skills to hone, competitions, etc...yet, I consider myself to be a methodical free spirit!  LOL!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Learning as I go, I used to be very anal about pretty much everything and had my life planned to the nth degree - but *life* got in the way too many times, and I don't feel that I made some of my best decisions by not being flexible.  My plans would be disrupted and I would fall into a depression because I had everything planned out and then couldn't fulfil those plans.  When you react that way, your response can become one of "what's the use, I might as well just give up", and I spent a few years in that mode of half-heartedly trying to plan but without having goals that were really MY goals, or at least not for MY *reasons*, and half-heartedly living.  <br><br>Part of living a successful life by your own standards is defining what your #1 value is and living according to that.  Mine is to "be free" - that encompasses a number of areas in my life - financial freedom, which will allow me to live life on my own clock, following my own interests; freedom of location, which an RV gives me; freedom of time and what I do in that time, which using AF allows - and the freedom not to follow it if I don't feel like it; freedom to make my own choices of what kind of life I want to live without taking into consideration what society thinks is *normal*.  <br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br>YES! It's all about our meta values.  I was quite fortunate because my father started me on this almost as soon as I could write and start choosing interests and skills I wanted to persue.  He always emphasized that values were like concentric circles.  He "helped" me to name each value on a separate index card and then create a pyramid and then change it into concentric circles so have different vantage points on the same thing.  Even 50 years hence, I remember my father asking what is the value that guides all other values?  I said "To be a decent human being......As I wrote it on the index card, it seemed to amplify it's meaning.....My father would have me continue on with the values and passions.  Then he introduced actual time-related things such as music lessons, art lessons, gymnastics, all my sports, etc......He reminded me about learning and my reading interests, etc........He taught me that it's all about developing your character, your reputation, your passions via vocations and avocations......all with those index cards.  He made a huge deal out of me putting it into my pocket and referring to it.  The back was for notes and also for focus or inspiration.   When he died, he saved all of my grade reports, medals, awards, etc.....In that pile was one of my index cards.  On the back it read:  Be more like my dad my own way.....<br>I never knew about him saving any of it.....I didn't think it mattered so much to him.  After all, I was only one of many siblings.......Him keeping that index card I wrote when I was in first grade still baffles me......yet fills my heart with gratitude that he was my Dad!  I tend to believe that he was a closet right-brained surgeon!  LOL!  And he knew that I was most like him for better or for worse....<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br>We're not alone....Christine B also "guides" herself with a plan.  It's under the forum: MY BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH AF.  I'm beginning to believe that our methods and implementation systems might appear to be radically different, yet.......the reasons for them aren't so different from a big picture perspective.  Some people like to stick their toe in the water to acclimate themselves to the temperature and others like to dive in.  Bottom line, we're all doing this to swim!  LOL!<br>learning as I go</div>
