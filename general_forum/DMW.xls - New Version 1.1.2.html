<div class="content">Walter,<br>TQVM. Downloading.  ;-) Oops have to wait 30mins for another chance to download. :-/ <br>Just noting that this DWM (!?) version 1.1.2 is newer than DWM version 1.10 / 1.1.1 in earlier thread <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1168638" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1168638</a> "DWM.xls - New Version 1.10".</div>

<div class="content">Hi,<br>I just noticed that I wrote DMW on the subject.<br>I'm pretty sick (with fever) so this kind of mistakes are quite expectable.<br><br>I don't understand your question about the versions.<br>1.1.2 is supposed to be newer thant 1.1.1, isn't it?<br>1.10 is wierd. It should have been 1.1.0.</div>

<div class="content">Wasn't much of a question, Walter. Just that at the time I posted, the older thread "DWM.xls - New Version 1.10" was on top of "DMW.xls - New Version 1.1.2". <br><br>Oh, after reading the VBA "Info" module in DWM.xls, I think that should have been version 1.1 (not 1.10 or 1.1.0).<br><br>Now downloading DWM.xls v1.1.2. TQ. ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Walter,<br><br>I'm now on DWM.xls v1.1.2 with two small tweaks ...<br>(1) I have an additional column I for "Links", so I had to do manual import from DWM_old.xls. I do Ctrl-Shift-Z to disable events then copy necessary open/expired tasks. Not much prob.<br>(2) I commented out the "JumpToActiveTask" in Ctrl-Shift-C, so it's consistent with Ctrl-Shift-E & R acting on current task not active task.<br>... works great.<br><br>I also like to report a small bug in v1.1.2 and v1.1.1 ...<br>* If there is a pending dismissal, and you do Ctrl-Shift-R, after dismissal the wrong task is Re-Entered (though the right tasks are dismissed, and right task is closed).<br>* My current work-around is to do a Ctrl-Shift-S before any work in the morning, so dismissals (if any) would be done correctly.</div>
