<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-06-29 6:08</div>
<div class="content">I pose the above question in order to understand better the AF2 modalities. On reading Mark's instructions I see that one has three daily activities:<br><br>First, there is the working through the list of outstanding items, beginning each time from the entries on the last page.<br><br>Second, one has to take into account the tasks that have been mentally highlighted when going through the daily reading of the list.<br><br>Third, one takes into account that there are tasks (in the older pages) that are subject to dismissal in the following day or days.<br><br>Giving, therefore, appropriate weight to the second and third type of action and especially the relative importance of tasks (in the second or third type of action above) or the imminent chance of dismissal of tasks (in the third type of action above), my natural tendency would be to start doing tasks every day by giving priority to the second and third type of tasks before doing any tasks according to the first type of action.<br><br>I should emphasise that the above scenario is based on conditions where one has a "mature" list which is, say, several pages long.</div>

<div class="content">Otto,<br><br>according to the instructions things are somewhat different.<br><br>First you dismiss the items that you noted for dismissal yesterday (using that horizontal line) and haven't done till today . You should not work on any of these items at that moment. <br><br>Second, you read through the whole list  and notice that there are items about to be dismissed within the next days. You should not work on any of these items at that moment. <br><br>After you've finished reading the list, at least by now you should know whether you can easily move on to the third step, or do something about your feeling of discomfort with all those dismissesd and soon to be dimissed items in your head.  My take on this would be to either rewrite them at the end of the list, or write them onto my someday list or wait until my next weekly review (depening on the urgencies of the items.)<br><br>Third:  working through the list of outstanding items, beginning each time from the last entry on the last page.<br></div>

<div class="content">Here too I forgot to add:<br><br>When I re-enter a dismissed item into my list, I break it down to several feasible tasks,  I don't re-write the same old undoable stuff.<br><br>(Still sleepy on this Monday morning)</div>

<div class="meta">2009-06-29 11:18</div>
<div class="content">Otto and Rainer:<br><br>The preliminary at the start of the days consists of dismissing any uncompleted tasks on notice from the previous day, identifying the tasks on notice for dismissal for the current day and reading through the list from beginning to end.<br><br>Once that preliminary is finished there are only two things you have to do (with regard to the list that is):<br><br>1. Add new tasks to the end of the list as they occur to you or come up.<br><br>2. Starting from the last item on the list, look at each item in turn in turn until one "stands out". When you've done it, go back to the end of the list and do the same again.<br><br>There is no need to take account of anything else, and you should not re-enter tasks on notice of dismissal (either as a whole or broken down further) at the end of the list.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>I've probably missed it as I've just gotten back from vacation and am trying to catch up and still in a fog ;-)<br><br>How do the tasks put on notice for dismissal ever get done?  You say:<br><br>- Do not write them at the end<br>- Do nothing about them but "notice" them<br>- Start work at the END of the list<br><br>I can't see how I'd ever reach those tasks on notice.  They seem to be doomed to dismissal, but that can't be.  I'm guessing that your whole point in marking them as "on notice" was to give a real sense of urgency to get them worked on.<br><br>Before hearing your answer, my instinct would be to START with those marked "on notice", and only THEN move to the end.  Doing that justifies dismissing them the next day because I "had my chance and still did nothing about them".<br><br>In any case, I'll keep reading last weeks posts on this.  You've probably already covered this elsewhere.</div>

<div class="content">Mike:<br><br>Well, as I said in my reply to Otto and Rainer you don't decide (rationally) which items to do at all. You do the tasks which stand out for you.<br><br>I have a block of four tasks on notice for dismissal today. They are all ones which I know I really want and need to do. Because I have read through the list this morning paying particular attention to these items, my intuition is therefore primed that it should take me back to these items. Since it also knows that I am out this evening and have some major urgent stuff to do this afternoon too, it will probably lead me to those items fairly quickly. What I mean by "lead me to them" is that no item will stand out for me as I work back from the end until I reach one of those items. The same thing has to happen four times in order to clear all four tasks.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>O.K.  I may be starting to get the bigger picture here.  What I THINK you are saying is that once you have put items on notice they will stand out more, relative to every other item on the list so that when you start at the end (to take the extreme case here) you'll find NO items standing out until you wind up at the beginning and do those which are marked.<br><br>So the implication is that starting at the end of a very long list (caused by dumping, most likely) will not cause you to fail to reach the beginning of the list?  You will find yourself skipping over all (or most) of the other open tasks until you get back to the marked ones at the beginning?<br><br>Of course, another (clearly degenerative) example caused by dumping would be where you started the list with 50 open items and on the first day the first 40 would all be marked "on notice".  Then there would be no way to save them.<br><br>I guess that dumping is much more of a problem with AF2 because of the lack of page orientation and the "do one on a page and you don't have to dismiss the rest" rule in AF1.</div>

<div class="content">Smiley,<br><br>>>> 'START with those marked "on notice", and only THEN move to the end.'<br><br>That may compromise the handling of urgent items, which is a key feature of AF2. <<<<br><br>Yes, but if one does the urgent first and there is a whole day full of them, the first (and possibly more important) items are never reached.<br><br>>>> Also there may be some important items mid way, which risk getting left in favour of more trivial items 'on notice' <<<<br><br>Precisely my point about skipping them and starting at the end!<br><br>>>> If the items on notice ARE more important, they should 'stand out' more than anything in between. <<<<br><br>My problem is that if I don't SEE an item it has NO chance to stand out.  I get that reviewing the list primes one's subconscious.  I really do get that.  But once I start working on THE LIST, I'm working to rule and doing what stands out ... of those that are IN VIEW.  IOW, with AF1, pages were units and one compared them relative to each other.  But in AF2, the "page" is potentially infinitely long and much of it is not "in view" to allow comparison.  I really do see that I'd wind up working on the last page, continually adding new items to the end of the last page, and then tomorrow dismissing the entire block of (who knows how many?) items on the first pages.  I think this problem becomes more and more real as a person works in an urgency driven environment.<br><br>I guess that is why my most important tweak to AF1 was to use the index card to pull out today's MUST DOs.  Then, as I worked the list, I'd have that card in view also and be sure to work on those items NO MATTER WHAT!<br><br>Maybe the way I have to look at this is the first page of the new AF2 list is my "card" and I have to keep flipping back to it to remind myself what I need to keep in view at all times?  Not sure.  Maybe I'm making this into more of a problem than it is.</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>there are two reasons why I thought I needed three lists.<br><br>1) Being used to have at least two lists (at work and at home). It's a habit that worked fine with GTD and AF 1.  But habits can be changed, of course.<br><br>2) Starting with AF 2 I saw the danger that some of my high priority items (esp. some of my personal projects and current initiatives) will be dismissed before I get around to work on them. So my thought: Build a third list for the high priority stuff and work on this list first thing in the morning.<br><br>OTOH, having only one list makes sense, less effort, less paper to drag around.<br><br>This morning I decided to change my routine for my daily review task in that way that I will add my high priority items at the end of the list during my daily review. They will stand out as soon as I start working with the AF 2 list again .  And thus they won't get dismissed.<br><br>So, I'll give it a try and use only one AF 2 list. Let's see how this will work out.<br><br>Thanks for your help.<br> :-)</div>

But when I did so, I realised that there was actually no reason why it had to be done now and would in fact be better off being done in a week or so's time. I had imposed a false sense of priority on it. Somewhere my unconscious mind obviously already knew this! <<<<br><br>Oh, now I'm getting confused again ;-)<br><br>First of  all, I did what you said and worked by the rules AS I UNDERSTAND THEM (and realize, that my question was not asked to be contrary, but because I really can't see how to be sure I get TO the important early tasks so that I even have a chance to do them).  So I marked off the first block as "on notice".  Then I went to the end of the list and started working backward.  I found a number of tasks on the last page, and a few more on the previous three or so.  Those took up my entire day and I never reached the first page so this morning I have FOUR tasks which should be dismissed by the AF2 rules.  The trouble is that these cannot be dismissed.  I need to do them.  As I foresaw, I never got to even see them yesterday (after I marked them) because while on the last pages things "stood out" and were worked on.<br><br>This morning I'll mark off the next block (which just so happens to be four more tasks) and as I scanned the list I see that I'll be working on the last pages again.  Yesterday I added 22 tasks to the last page!  At this rate I'll be faced with dismissing four more tasks and I've looked at them closely and of the EIGHT, I cannot dismiss ANY of them.  I can keep at this but the list of tasks marked "on notice" is just going to grow and grow.  I have to find some way to "get back there" so I can even have a crack at them!<br><br>Maybe what I'm not expressing is that these are tasks which have to be done; they have to be done in the "near future"; and they are not dismissible.  IOW, I simply cannot afford to ignore them.  If the AF2 rules allowed it, there are two on that list that I'd start working on right now!<br><br>I notice that you dismissed a task that did not need to be done for a week or so.  Are you operating (implicitly) from the frame that tasks which are not due within a week should be dismissed to be added back later?  That seems to be too short for me.  If I did that I could dismiss right and left.  But then I'd just be adding them back again in a week or so.  (If I were going to do that, it would make just about as much sense to rewrite them at the end of the list to start with ... kind of collapsing the two tasks of dismissing and adding back!  (And, come to think about it, that would put them more in the focus of my attention ... but I already know why that is not such a hot idea.)  And even so, it does not address my original question of how do you ever even get to SEE the tasks, according to the AF2 rules?  If the rules are:<br><br>- Dismiss "on notice"<br>- Mark new "on notice"<br>- Scan the entire list<br>- Start at the end and work backward<br><br>How do you EVER get to the beginning to save those poor waifs if your list is long?  Are you possibly suggesting that one has in mind that they are there and so you just "work" on the last pages in a cursory way so that you FORCE yourself to get back to page one so that you can work on those items?<br><br>Anyway, that is where I'm confused.  It seems to me that there has to be some way, in the rules, to get me to the beginning of the list ... PRONTO so that I can do those things before they have to be dismissed.  (I say PRONTO because the new dismissal rule is that the block is not saved if ONE task is done, but ALL must be done ... depending on size and what else is going on, this might be daunting.)<br><br>Well, that was my adventure with AF2 yesterday <wanders off muttering to self></div>

<div class="content">Linda,<br><br>>>>    <<Starting with AF 2 I saw the danger that some of my high priority items (esp. some of my personal projects and current initiatives) will be dismissed before I get around to work on them.>><br><br>Initially had that concern too with AF2. Then I had a bit of a mini-revelation - if I haven't got time to work on tasks right now, then they shouldn't be on the list!  <<<<br><br>I realize that as well, but the key question is "how long is 'right now'"?<br><br>Looking at the two extremes:<br><br>- AF2 is a list of every wish, dream, or half-baked idea.  Basically, nothing is dismissed.  It seems as if Seraphim works that way.  As he puts it, he has lots of creative ideas that he needs to keep there until they mature in some way.  This leads to a horrendously long list that is hard to process.  But then it is all there in front of you, at least.<br><br>- AF2 is a list of only those things that one WILL do TODAY!  This is basically the DIT closed list, I guess.  Well, maybe not technically, but it does have that kind of feel to it.  Or maybe the old daily TODO list that one works sequentially, then rewrites again tomorrow.<br><br>Personally, I operate between those extremes.  I put items on the list that:<br><br>- I really WANT to do,<br>- I really want to do in the REASONABLE future<br><br>and I dismiss when the list has shown me that I was mistaken about either of those two things.  So, for a concrete example ... out of my recent physical exam and lab tests came several things I  need to do.  It has not quite been one month since I put them on there and a vacation and preparation for two big projects has intervened and kept me from them.  They MUST be on the list (or at least SOMEWHERE to assure they get done) and they must ge done SOON.  They can NOT be dismissed.  So, for me, for these tasks, "reasonable time" is "sometime well before my next doctor's visit in the next two months".<br><br>>>>  I was always reluctant to dismiss tasks with AF1, as I treated them as 'gone for good'. But they're not, if you review dismissed tasks regularly, you always have the option to add some back in when you have more time to work on them at a later date.  <<<<br><br>Oh yes, that is absolutely true.  HOWEVER, in the example I just gave, I do not WANT to put them out of sight as they need to get done reasonably soon and I need to keep trying to fit them into my other scheduled items.<br><br>>>>  The other thing I am doing is if a see a task that realistically cannot be done in the next day or two, but CAN'T be dismissed, is putting it onto my calendar (sometime in the future) as a reminder, then deleting it from the AF list. Each morning when I I check my calendar, if there's a reminder, I add it to my AF list.  <<<<br><br>Now that is where I was coming from with my "index card".  But Mark indicated that I ought to try to make the list work according to the rules ... a calendar entry is no different in spirit to an index card.  My items are not actually appointments so they really don't belong on the calendar.  They are unscheduled tasks which I must DO so they belong on my TO DO list.<br><br>>>>  So in general, the tasks on my AF2 list as only those that I can realistically do in the next couple of days. Keep the list 'lean and mean', I say!  <<<<br><br>In that spirit I could expand my projects lists and only put what GtD calls the "next actions" on my AF2 list.  OTOH, the whole beauty of AF is that it eats whatever you throw at it.  I'm not excited about turning it into a daily style TO DO list.</div>

<div class="content">Mike <br><<you just "work" on the last pages in a cursory way so that you FORCE yourself to get back to page one so that you can work on those items?>><br><br>Mark will answer this better than I can, but my understanding is that you start at the beginning of the day reviewing the whole list from the start. So you KNOW you have some key 'on notice' tasks that must be done today.<br><br>Therefore, when you start processing the list, working back from the end, your intuition/rationality should allow you to ignore those less urgent intervening tasks and so focus on the 'on notice' tasks. After all, you don't HAVE to work on intervening tasks if they don't stand out.<br><br>At least that is how it's been working for me.</div>
<h2>Reply by Mike</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-06-30 12:59</div>
<div class="content">Hey Linda,<br><br>But here is the problem: the rule says "work on what stands out", not what you rationally know is most important.  If I am looking at the last page, I am seeing what "stands out" on THAT PAGE.  If I could have my list on one of those illuminated scrolls that Mark is using ;-) I could roll it all out and scan the whole thing for what stands out and, of course, then I'd see those first items as standing out most.  But the list is STILL actually a collection of pages.  That is so because the rule says to start working on the last page and work backward.  So I can't really see the WHOLE list to see what "stands out" on the WHOLE list.<br><br>For example, right now, looking at my last page, "Buy Bike repair tools" and "Find out what size tires the bike uses" are two items that stand out very strongly.  This is so because in about two weeks my wife will be on her big bike ride and things have to be ready.  Yet in reality, in the big scheme of things, those medical follow-up items are much more "important".  So it is an importance/urgency thing.  Bike stuff is Q1, medical stuff is Q2 ... at this moment.  Before our vacation last week, the bike stuff was Q2.  Things change with time.<br><br>So, when you say:<br><br>>>>  Therefore, when you start processing the list, working back from the end, your intuition/rationality should allow you to ignore those less urgent intervening tasks and so focus on the 'on notice' tasks. After all, you don't HAVE to work on intervening tasks if they don't stand out. <<<<br><br>You are equating "less urgent" with "not standing out".  Those are different ideas to me.  If I were to work by urgency, I would process the whole list in a very different way.<br></div>

<div class="content">Mike<br>In response to you previous post (which crossed with mine) regarding turning the AF list into a daily DIT list, I do see your point. Yes, I also sit somewhere between the two extremes, but I am more towards the end of the spectrum that wants less on my list (otherwise I have too much choice of actions and grind to a halt, through being indecisive as to which action to choose! Perhaps there's a psychological difference in operating the two styles of Autofocus, and different personalities prefer one or the other. I never really was comfortable with AF1, but I'm up and flying with AF2!<br><br>Another point is that one only has to make a small action towards completing the task, and then adding it to the end of the list to progress it. So, as an example, if I have a task 'Mark student assignments', and it's on notice, then as long as I do something to move the task on (e.g. read first assignment , it won't be dismissed. I simply cross it off and add it to the end of the list. It's the 'little and often' to break down the procrastination which is useful for me.<br><br>I think the danger might be that if someone is over-committed then they might end up working in a very fragmentary way, moving on lots of little tasks to stop them being dismissed.</div>

<div class="content">Mike<br>Our posts keep crossing! I'll keep this one short. I think it comes back to the way we define 'standing out'. If I know something is urgent then it usually stands out more than less urgent tasks. Not always the case though.<br></div>

So, as an example, if I have a task 'Mark student assignments', and it's on notice, then as long as I do something to move the task on (e.g. read first assignment , it won't be dismissed. I simply cross it off and add it to the end of the list. It's the 'little and often' to break down the procrastination which is useful for me.  <<<<br><br>Yes, but still ... how do I ever even GET to SEE those "on notice" tasks.  AF2 takes me right to the end of the list and starts me working backward so I have process everything that stands out from the end all the way to the beginning ... the ENTIRE LIST, before I even get a CHANCE to SEE the "on notice" items.  See my problem?<br><br>Now Mark's new suggestion of AF1 with AF2 dismissal seems to at least begin to answer my problem.  Also, maybe my thought about working on ONLY ONE item per page would help.  I don't know yet.  I don't want to cloud the new system with tweaks right out of the gate.  ;-)</div>

<div class="content">>>>  Our posts keep crossing! I'll keep this one short.  <<<<br><br>LOL ;-)<br><br>>>>   I think it comes back to the way we define 'standing out'. If I know something is urgent then it usually stands out more than less urgent tasks. Not always the case though. <<<<br><br>But still, there is that pesky page problem.  A thing cannot "stand out" if it is not even in view.  If it is not on the current page, it can't be in view.</div>

<div class="content">Mike<br><br>You don't have to see something for it to stand out.  If an item is on notice it sits in my memory all day, standing out to a certain degree.  All other items I scan during the day will subconsciously be compared with my "on notice" items.  If those items are truly important, I will get to them unless I am seriously over committed with too many "essential" items.</div>

<div class="content">Yes, thanks, Jim, that is what I have been meaning I think with my (incorrect) use of the word 'urgent'. Mark says that it's the combined rational/intuitive element that makes AF so powerful. You can't just use one part of it.</div>

<div class="content">Mike:<br><br>I can't remember whether you said that you were starting a new list for AF2 or using your old one. But it sounds as if you would be much better off starting with a new list and growing it in the way I suggest in the instructions.  AF2 is much less forgiving than AF1 to having tasks dumped into it. If you've got more than four pages after only one day on the system you are almost certainly entering tasks too fast.</div>

<div class="content">Here is the way I handle AF2 & sent a note to Mark yesterday thanking him for this new system b/c I got SO MUCH more accomplished yesterday than I did on Friday (on my work list).  <br><br>1 - I draw a line beneath the oldest items to be dismissed first thing tomorrow.<br>2 - I read the entire list (12 pages of 32 items many of which are complete due to carry-over from AF1)<br>3 - As I read the list, I use post-it arrows to mark the ones that stand out during my daily review (I used 5 this morning).  These are the ones that I know I must finish today, but I know I'll either never find again if I do accomplish them, or I may never get to them during the day b/c once I read through the list my mind will wander elsewhere.<br>4 - I start on the last page & find 5 super quick items to do first to get me in the rhythm of AF2 (usually items I do daily that don't require a lot of work or thought...lets my caffeine kick in)<br>5 - I start on the last page & keep going to last page knowing that if nothing else, I must finish those that I marked.<br>6 - I keep throwing new things on the list that my boss throws at me (he throws stuff at me all day long so that he doesn't have to remember it), now confident that I won't forget those items b/c I now review them constantly before each new task.  <br><br>Yesterday I added 58 new tasks to my list & nothing was lost while working the list and I was able to make it to the beginning of the list twice...once to make sure I didn't have to dismiss anything at the end of the day & the second to make sure I didn't have a large block of items to put on notice today.  <br><br>Yesterday I was also able to clear off most of my desk, which I haven't really seen since before the month of June!<br><br>Thanks again Mark.</div>

<div class="content">Mike, I wonder if you are still in the AF1 mindset where everything is organized by pages and you literally don't "see" certain tasks for quite a while. When you read your whole list at the beginning of the day and notice tasks (maybe even the about to be dismissed ones) that you really want/need to do, you will likely find that you can just skim over all the other tasks on the way to them. It's still important to look at all the other tasks because there may be something you need to get started before you start working on those soon-to-be-dismissed tasks, KWIM? Just don't ask yourself, "Am I willing to do this now?" Just cruise toward those hot tasks, refusing to be sidetracked unless there's something yelling at you. ;-)<br><br>To keep my list shorter, I also have a DoThisFirst task which means to work on my bigger deadlined projects using that particular app. Rather than have all kinds of steps toward these projects written willy-nilly around my list, I keep my list short and sweet and can get to those big fish quickly. <br><br>How was your cruise??</div>

<div class="content">Top o' the mornin' to 'ya, Mark,<br><br>>>>  I can't remember whether you said that you were starting a new list for AF2 or using your old one.  <<<<br><br>As you mentioned in your instructions, AF2 works with the AF1 list so I just kept the list and altered the processing.<br><br>>>> But it sounds as if you would be much better off starting with a new list and growing it in the way I suggest in the instructions. AF2 is much less forgiving than AF1 to having tasks dumped into it. If you've got more than four pages after only one day on the system you are almost certainly entering tasks too fast.  <<<<br><br>Remember that my pages are shorter than yours ... I am using a pocket size notebook and so have only 15 lines per page.  That is a mixed blessing.  The shortness keeps me focused better and forces decisions on open items more.  However, the focus implies that I don't see what is on other pages so there is lots I don't see.<br><br>Oh bother, now I'm going to have to think if I want to start yet another a new list.  I just finished a book and am in the early pages of my new one (page 18).  I really hate carrying around multiple books.<br><br>From what you say here, I'm getting that the implication is that AF2 is going to require a smaller number of active pages.  Well, that and also it enforces the quick closing of pages.<br><br>Thanks for the input.  I'll have to decide about starting over.</div>

<div class="content">Debs,<br><br>EEEP!   You added 58 items yesterday and Mark thinks *I* am adding items much to fast!  ;-)<br><br>Thanks for sharing how you are working AF2.  I am starting to suspect that I must add a rule to AF2 that alters how I process backward.  I must devise some procedure to get me to the front of the list no matter what.  It seems, if I read you correctly, that you entered some kind of "scan mode" to force you to the front.  IOW, you were not looking to really process each page so much as "get through them" so that you could get to your flagged items and "on notice" items.  Does that sound right?<br><br>I like the idea of the Post-It flags.  I have been using highlighters.  But both solutions are a pain in that they required more "hardware" ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Mel,<br><br>Yes, a different way of processing the pages are what is starting to dawn on me.  It seems as if the instruction should be (sorry Mark, I'm NOT asking you to rewrite anything ;-):<br><br>- Dismiss the "on notice items"<br>- Mark the next block of open items "on notice"<br>- Scan through the list for hot items<br>- Start at the BEGINNING and do the "on notice items" (if you don't want them dismissed)<br>- Move to the END and process backward.<br><br>That change would also give one last chance to do yesterday's "on notice" items if you really really really did not want to dismiss them.  ;-)<br><br>Yes, like you, I tend to have my bigger projects just mentioned in the list then go to a second list of TODOs related only to that one project.  I'd go nuts if I had to fracture my time with bits and pieces of a project strewn about ;-)<br><br>Cruise:  Oh, delightful, and much needed.  Damn but my wife really DID need it something awful.  I could just watch her change after the first couple of days.  Now she is re-energized and planning her 318 mile bike ride in two weeks!<br><br>I loved the cruise but the weather was awful.  The first day out the weather was rough and barf bags were everywhere.  Then the captain announced that he was slowing the ship down.  The winds were high in Bermuda and we had to go through a very tiny channel to get into port so he wanted to let the storm pass.  Also, cutting speed made the ride less rough.<br><br>It was sad to see so many people freak out with that news.  One woman collapsed in tears in the hallway, sobbing about her ruined vacation.  Gees, for me it was just so much fun being on the ship, eating good food, lounging in the hot tub, seeing the shows, etc.  How does a bit of rain ruin THAT?  No, we did not get to snorkel (and we even bought some new gear) but hey, I'll do that next time.  I did take some good books and the laptop so I got a lot of fun reading done.<br><br>Of course, the BEST part was coming back, logging on to Mark's site, and finding that he had released AF2.  I'm in heaven ;-) ;-) ;-)<br><br>Now to get down to deciding the parameters of my July challenge.  I do like that idea and will participate.<br></div>

<div class="content">Mike,<br><br>Of those 58, I've completed 31 (as well as many others throughout my book), so although it seems like a lot, I'm getting quite a bit completed and doing the items at the front of the list that I was procrastinating on as well...and this is just my work book (I haven't combined my lists yet).  <br><br>I've found that unless I meet with my boss, I seldom add a lot of items at once (this is end of quarter & end of month for us, so a lot going on right now). Once I mark everything in my book that I need to accomplish today, I then make sure all fires are out on the last page & start moving backwards.  Some items that I mark with the post-it arrow are items I'm waiting for others to give me information or reports, so it reminds me to ask them about it.<br><br>I've also found that the constant reading of the last page, really gets me motivated to do those items & keeps them from being forgotten.  And, drawing the dismissal line at the front of the book keeps me motivated to do those items as well as break up larger blocks throughout my book so that I'm not dismissing large blocks at a time.  <br><br>Thanks to everyone for the great discussions on how you process your list.  It keeps me motivated and is more helpful than you know.  :)</div>

<div class="content">Mike,<br><br>You write:  <br>- Dismiss the "on notice items"<br>- Mark the next block of open items "on notice"<br>- Scan through the list for hot items<br>- Start at the BEGINNING and do the "on notice items" (if you don't want them dismissed)<br>- Move to the END and process backward.<br><br><br>I have thought about this too, but I began to think this would lead to a problem.  The problem is not, however, the actual items facing dismissal today, but the items that will be in this situation over the next two or three days.  I have two items today facing dismissal.  I do not want to dismiss them.  Since I know that I will get to those items, why not just do them now and be done with it?  Well, if I know that I will just do the items facing dismissal at the start of each day, I have less incentive to work my way through the list which has the consequence of breaking up large block of unactioned tasks that may be on the dismissal list in several days.  This means I may, inadvertently give short shrift to the items in the middle of my list.  The biggest advantege of leaving items where they are and work them in order, is it forces us to give some attention to everything on the list; by forcing us to make some effort to work to get to the "to be dismissed" items, means we make it easier to deal with "to be dismissed" items down the road (the more we actually work the items as we move to the "to be dismissed" area, we clear up those large blocks of unactioned task which helps down the road.)</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>>>> I actually tried something very similar to what you suggest during the testing but found that it increased my resistance to working the list at all.   <<<<br><br>I guess I don't know how I would react.  So far, with AF1, I've been dragging my feet on the hard items and finding ways to avoid dismissing them ... while doing the easy and urgent ones.  I'm bound and determined to find a way out of that mode.<br><br>>>> Of course you may be made of sterner stuff than I am.  <<<<br><br>LOL ;-)  I can't imagine it.  I'm sure it takes a lot of determination to keep tweaking your systems and evaluating the relative merits.<br><br>I've been resisting putting any metrics into my list but for July I'm going to do it.  After a month I will have some objective measure of how whatever I'm doing is actually working.  Then if I change something, I'll know the effect.  (It says here in fine print!  ;-)<br><br>FWIW, I have not counted yet (I will later for the metrics) but I added at least three pages of new tasks and did quite a few on the last pages but never made my way back to those "on notice".  By rights, there are eight that should be dismissed and a few more going on notice tomorrow.  OY!  ;-)<br></div>

<div class="content">Mike,<br><br>Welcome back!<br><br>Are you even thinking about NOT dismissing that block of 8? tsk tsk!<br><br>As with AF1, I found the first few days exhilarating. The switch to constantly reviewing the last entered items has at least two marked effects:<br>- you can easily break a task out into a working checklist and then get straight on working the checklist<br>- I find much less resistance to entering tasks before I work them, as I know I have the option to get on them as soon as I have finished with the current task. <br><br>I do have a problem with early dismissal of tasks which I can only do at the weekend, and the list is still only at six pages (I started with a one page list taht I had just restarted from AF1.<br><br>(And an irrelevant thought: although the list itself is open, at each pass of the list, you review a closed view of it. Subtle or what? Just popped into my head so I thought I'd write it down.)</div>

<div class="content">That did not happen.  I wonder what Mark does with his weekly repeats if he puts them in AF and then fails to finish them.  I suppose it would matter if the item could be finished at a later date.  I do this with "Cut Hair" which I put on my list every few weeks.  I suspect that if I did not finish a task over the weekend, and I could not finish it during the week, I would start thinking about a different type of list or really asking myself what my problem was.  If the event is not urgent, but could only do it on the weekend, I would leave it and dismiss it if necessary.</div>

<div class="content">As I started AF2 from my AF1 list that is not a problem but I would imagine that, after a few weeks there will be more than 7 batches of on notice items, which will enable every task to be actioned whether weekday or weekend tasks.</div>
