<div class="content">A recent post by JTKaspar ("Please help me ditch GTD") has motivated me to make my own first post on this forum. I think that Mark's Revised AutoFocus (RAF) is almost totally compatible with GTD. I've been using GTD for a couple of years, and RAF for only 15 days, so perhaps I'm off base here.<br><br>Anyway, my experience is that the written-notebook-based RAF is a great way of implementing the main concepts of GTD. For me, the key points about GTD are having one In tray for all paper-based info, treating the calendar as sacred (no to-do's), using a 43-folders "tickler" file for structured procrastination, treating the email Inbox the same as the paper In tray (Merlin Mann's Inbox Zero video), dumping *everything* into "In" (mind sweep), having one alphabetical filing system, concentrating most often on next actions rather than project outcomes, and doing weekly reviews. All of this can be accomplished better using RAF as the motivating mechanism, keeping you in the flow of getting "everything" done, as Mark would say.<br><br>I could go on, but what does everyone else think?</div>

<div class="content">I have posted on this elsewhere on the forum, but more about RAF being the means by which you actually DO GTD. I have context lists of sorts and I only list the context on my main AF list. With GTD you are conceivably in many contexts at once (phone, computer, home, for example when you are in your home). How do you decide what you should be doing at any given time? How do you keep your lists from burgeoning out of control? RAF is the answer. Rather than doing a traditional weekly review, I choose the tasks that I can reasonably accompllsh from my "context" lists and add them to my main AF list. Best wishes making it work for you. It DOES work!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mel,<br><br>Would you be willing to share some more about your intriguing system of GTD context lists on Outlook and how you transfer items to your main AF list?<br><br>Thanks,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content"><<A recent post by JTKaspar ("Please help me ditch GTD") has motivated me to make my own first post on this forum.>> Good to see I'm motivating someone! :)<br><br>I agree with you Ubi, I am keeping most of what I learned from GTD - all the things you mentioned. However my task lists were unwieldy and it was difficult to keep "hard edges" between them. I probably did a handful of weekly reviews in a year of GTD. What I wanted to "ditch" was context lists - which I have.<br><br>Thanks for the insight</div>
