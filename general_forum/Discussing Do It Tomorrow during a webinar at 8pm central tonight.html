<div class="content">Frank Degenaar and I have a video podcast we do regularly.  Each podcast is focused on a different book we have read and created systems for.  Last podcast was on "168 Hours" ( https://youtu.be/ppTmM65W1Uw ), and tonight's podcast is on "Do It Tomorrow", a book both Frank and I have read multiple times has influenced the development of our individual personal management systems.  The podcast is hosted as a webinar initially, so participants can chat and ask questions we can respond to.  Then it is edited and uploaded as a video podcast on YouTube so people can watch the replay.<br><br>It is scheduled for tonight, but here is the timeframe for different time zones:<br><br>July 5th:<br>6pm Pacific <br>7pm Mountain<br>8pm Central<br>9pm Eastern<br><br>July 6th for those in the Eastern Hemisphere:<br>9am Singapore <br>10am Tokyo<br>11am Sydney, Australia <br>1pm New Zealand<br><br>If you are interested in attending, here is the link to register: https://us06web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_Er6vtGlxTsKfnkVLjYVziA</div>

<div class="content">Thank you for posting this David - I took away a number of insights that I will be applying to my time management processes.  Still using AF1/AF Condensed myself (analog Hobonichi) but am thinking about how to employ your Closed list approach to that. Am a little bit unclear as to how you "put a pin in it" in declaring a closed list - is it time based?<br><br>Also very much enjoyed the 168 Hours book discussion!</div>
