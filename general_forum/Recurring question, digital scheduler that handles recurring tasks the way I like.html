<div class="content">When faced with a huge post-vacation backlog, what do I do first? Look for a system that will work the way I want (and then go back to my tried-and-true vacation backlog-busting system).<br><br>Is there anything new out there?<br><br>My ideal task capture and scheduling system would:<br><br>Must Have<br>- tentatively place recurring tasks in the schedule. Most only schedule the next time when the current one is done. If I want to do an hour-long task each day, that's 5 hours, but on Monday morning, most systems only show the first occurrence. This is the biggest hurdle.<br>- calculate total time planned each day, to prevent over-scheduling. This cannot be done without point 1.<br>- be online, so I can access it from any device<br>- have a quick-add feature<br>- fits my budget. Free for a month, then $40/year for all of the above, maybe a bit more for the would-be-nice. A basic plan with the Must Haves and a premium that does more usually succeeds in getting me to upgrade.<br>- subtasks<br><br>Would Be Nice<br>- let me edit completion date, so I don't have to update it every night to have an accurate record. Want, not need.<br>- multiple labels per task (so I can group by whatever I dream up -- context, assistant, urgency, energy)<br><br>As of this week:<br><br>GQueues, ToodleDo and ToDoist all fail the first one. SkedPal has been updated recently and looks promising, but is $120/year.<br><br>Google Calendar has recurring goals in Android, but not the web version, even in Chrome.<br><br>Meanwhile, back to work. Today I get to use a dozen different online systems, all of which have changed. What could be a 2-hour job will take 10 by the time I update passwords and figure out the new forms.</div>

<div class="content">Cricket,<br><br>Have you looked into TickTick - www.ticktick.com ?  Unlike Asana, it gives you the option of showing all future occurrences of recurring tasks or just the next one.  I just started using if and am very pleased with it so far.<br><br>You can have multiple labels (tags) per task but I don't believe that you can edit the completion date - at least I haven't found out how to yet.  They also have a version for every platform.<br><br>Might be worth looking into.<br><br>Tom</div>

<div class="content">Thanks! At first glance TickTick looks good. Testing it out is now on my rewards list.</div>

<div class="content">Another suggestion is Things! https://culturedcode.com/things/<br>I am using this app since more than a year now and am very satisfied...</div>

<div class="content">Christian, Things only works on Apple products, but I'm happy for it to be in the thread. It makes the thread more useful for everyone.</div>

<div class="content">You may want to try out an auto-scheduler. <br><br>Check my website - www.ScheduleU.org - to discover a list of the latest ones available.<br><br>They all do something none of the others mentioned in the Comments do (so far). When you return from vacation, they each re-assemble your schedule of flexible tasks in your calendar. Usually, this takes place with the click of a button, or by taking a similar action.<br><br>So you don't have to drag and drop tasks manually, which is quite a painful exercise.<br><br>For example, I use one called SkedPal - which I played a tiny role in developing. <br><br>Hope this helps,<br><br>Francis</div>

<div class="content">Neat stuff on SchedulU. Looks like a dangerous place to visit when I want a quick break. I want to look deeper at the other programs it lists. Some look promising. (They all look like dangerous places to visit when I have just a few minutes to kill.)</div>
