<div class="content">This morning I used the filter function to good effect.  I am going into town and wanted a list of all the tasks I could do in town.  The filter allowed me to make a list of the relevant tasks which I could then print out.  Rather neatly the filter shows the list organised A to Z, so related tasks like buy X, buy Y were together and easy to pick out.<br><br>If only DWM could stop it snowing.</div>
