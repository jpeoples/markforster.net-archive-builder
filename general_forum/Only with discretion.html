<div class="content">Seems to me AF is a system for managing discretionary tasks - those where you either have discretion over whether you do them or discretion over when you do them. That means that real evaluation can only be in the context of the methods being used to manage other types of task.<br><br>AF is not appropriate for Immediate tasks (that is both Immediate-NOW and Immediate-FUTURE). Immediate-NOW needs to be done straight away and need not be listed anywhere, Immediate-FUTURE will need to be tracked in a Calendar or Alarm application.<br>Nor is it really appropriate for tasks that you already know you won't do today or anyday soon - ie the Someday/Maybe tasks; having them on this list would just clutter it up and require frequent consideration of whether to dismiss them. A list of these will need to be kept somewhere else.<br>Tasks that have to be done Today really need to be managed differently to other tasks. Possibly within AF - if they can be abstracted from the whole list so that there is a check on time needed against time available OR if there is always enough time available to cover them.<br>Tasks with a deadline are a little more iffy. There's no problem if tasks are always completed comfortably before a deadline. There's no problem if you can easily review the whole list every single day and are aware of any already fully loaded days coming up. There's a bit of a risk of not having enough time for all Deadline Today tasks if those conditions aren't met. How much of a risk depends on the proportion of time/days taken up by Essential/Scheduled/Deadline tasks rather than discretionary tasks and the consequences of missing deadlines. Tasks with imminent deadlines are probably best managed by moving them to the other (calendar/alarm) system.<br>Recurrent tasks really depend on their type. AF is not a very effective method of managing weekly or greater recurrency since tasks will be wastefully reviewed more often. Once done, they are better managed on the calendar already needed for Immediate-Future tasks; when they become current again they can either be put on AF (if don't have to be done today) or on the Today method/list.<br><br>Overall it seems to me that AF would be problematic for people with a high proportion of Immediate and Scheduled tasks, especially if the quantity can vary a lot with little warning, unless it is explicitly only used for discretionary tasks and they will need another method of managing the variety of Immediate and Imminent Deadline tasks. Even so, I can see how it can aid productivity so long as there is a system to manage other tasks and activities.</div>
