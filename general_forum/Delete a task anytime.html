<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">In two recent posts, Mark has advised that one can decide simply to delete a task at any time.  I had been under the impression that, unless I worded the task carefully, this was not allowed according to strict interpretation of the rules.  That is, a task would hang out undone on the list until it was dismissed (highlighted), and then would finally die when I reviewed it and decided not to reenter it.  Because of this interpretation, I sometimes prefaced a task description with "Consider ..." or put a question mark (?) at the end.  These little hacks allowed me to delete those tasks sooner, without feeling that I had violated the rules.  But now Mark has indicated that reconsidering a task on the fly, and deciding not to do it, is a valid action.  Sounds good to me!</div>

<div class="content">Ubi:<br><br>I've been talking about it for ages on and off. In fact I think a year or so ago I even advised having a "Weed the List" task, with the aim of deleting tasks that were no longer wanted or relevant.</div>

<div class="content">Okay...Deleting not dismissing - for tasks we decide NOT  to do.<br><br>But how are those shown on the list? Highlighted in case we want to reconsider doing them later when we review dismissed items? Or maybe blacked out so you can't even see them again?<br><br>This forum is a huge help!</div>
