<div class="content">I was thinking about Mick the Mechanic (DIT, chapter 6) and his poor competitor, Joe Slobb.  <br><br>I was trying to think through how Mick the Mechanic might use Autofocus.  But I couldn't wrap my head around it.  Maybe I'm just too tired today...  :-)<br><br>Anyway, does anyone want to help with this mental exercise?</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br>He would use the AF open list for his administrative tasks (paperwork, ordering of parts, etc). The appointments would be diarised, and he would work off a closed list for each car as before.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Mark, that makes sense.</div>

<div class="content">So should he have an "appointment" for the admin tasks or just do them during discretionary time?</div>

<div class="content">Gretchen:<br><br>In this type of job it is normal to work consistently on the cars until they are finished, so administrative jobs would be done once everything else had been finished. Accordingly your question doesn't really arise.<br><br>However the basic principle is that you use AF during the gaps between non-discretionary time periods.</div>
