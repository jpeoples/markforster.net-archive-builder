<div class="content">I have found it beneficial to express myself daily in a journal, and Mark's books all make some mention of this kind of activity.<br><br>For about six months, I had been using a great site called 750words.com. Like iDoneThis it encourages you to keep a daily streak going. In addition, it has a rewarding popup that notifies you when you have written 750 words. It also has all kinds of analysis of your words that assess you along a number of psychological dimensions.<br><br>I like 750words.com. I don't use the textual analysis, but I like the automatic popup. Before using 750words.com, I would time myself.<br><br>But a drawback of 750words.com is that it is not globally searchable. Now, I use my journal more as a means of expression and less as a means of documentation. But, more and more, I have been thinking that there really is no need to distinguish expression so sharply from documentation.<br><br>I know that there are a lot of journaling apps available, but the last thing I want to do is create yet another database. Then I realized, I already use Evernote (EN) for my FV system. It doesn't have the journaling-specific functions of 750words.com or other journaling software, but I believe there is a high probability that EN is going to be around for a long time, it is easily searchable, it can count words, it syncs across lots of platforms, and I have it open all the time anyway.<br><br>I then found this post:<br><a href="http://discussion.evernote.com/topic/24814-updating-a-diary/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://discussion.evernote.com/topic/24814-updating-a-diary/</a><br>where the contributor Don Sakers had a lot of good suggestions.<br><br>So, as of today I will be journaling in EN.</div>

<div class="content">What would a journaling-specific function be?  In OneNote I would simply create a Journal section, and then go New Page, Insert Date, and type 250 words.  Search is built-in.  EverNote would be essentially the same thing.  What more is there?</div>

<div class="content">Alan,<br><br>Well, 750words.com has a nice green pop-up that notifies me when I have completed 750 words. In EN, I have to click Notes -- Word Count.<br><br>Also 750words.com has all kinds of textual analysis that compares current mood to average mood of previous journal entries and average mood of all journaling people. In addition it has information on number of words written, words per minute, etc.<br><br>750words.com also keeps track of how many successive days I have journaled. It gives me virtual rewards as my streak grows. It also provides a graphical representation in the form of a row of X's.<br><br>The site also have some social media kinds of bells and whistles that I don't use, but many others might find motivating.</div>

<div class="content">With 750words, on weekends I would often use the speech-to-text function on my Android phone and dictate my journal entries. My 16-year-old son would always complain that I was cheating when he saw (and heard) me do that.<br><br>I am hoping I can figure out how to do that with EN as well.</div>

<div class="content">Does your speech-to-text function have email? EN gives you an email address. Anything you mail to it becomes a note. You can put codes in the subject line to control the notebook and subject line and I'm not sure what else. It might be a premium EN feature.</div>

<div class="content">Interesting.  I recently started logging, but not a journal.  I have a list of activities I want to promote and bad habits I want to avoid.  Each day I mark which I did, and each week I set a goal of how frequently I want to do each of these activities.  It might also be useful to track things like daily mood.  <br><br>I could imagine keeping a journal, but I couldn't see doing 750 words or finding that volume useful.  Maybe a paragraph or two at most.  Maybe just a smiley face instead of all that, and a sentence saying why.<br><br>:-)<br>|:-(<br>:-|<br>8-D<br>:'-(</div>

<div class="content">Cricket,<br>Yes. I could talk an email and send it to EN.<br><br>Alan,<br>Many decades ago, when I kept my very first journal, I wanted it to be serious and important. These days, it is based much more on the notion of free-writing. I don't worry about grammar, punctuation, or even if it makes any sense. The important thing for me is to write continuously.<br><br>So, 750 words is not a lot when you set your standards low.<br><br>I only use the speech-to-text occasionally on weekends. But it takes almost no time to speak 750 words.</div>

<div class="content">Alan, I find charts work well for that. Look up chore charts for kids. I find weekly or biweekly is best. That way I get plenty of fresh starts. I used to print a page every week with my weekly dashboard. It had weekly events, menu planning[1], repeating tasks (daily and weekly), and areas things to focus on. Sometimes it had more.<br><br>[1] Menu planning helped. I knew if I had to thaw the meat on Tuesday because Wednesday was the only chance for a family meal, and that I had to use it on Wednesday because the rest of the week was nuts. I need to start that again.</div>

<div class="content">Alan asked what value I find in journaling.<br><br>I kept a journal on and off when I was young and then abandoned it.<br><br>About 10 years ago I started reading about the studies done by James Pennebaker. People who wrote about their thoughts and feelings had fewer illnesses than people in control groups who did not write about their thoughts and feelings. That got me started.<br><br>Since the focus of these fora is time management, Alan Lakein in his book How to Get Control of Your Time and Your Life wrote something that really affected me deeply. He said that thinking about things tends not to be very useful for most people if that thought is not represented in a concrete form. If one writes, however, (and I would add "speaks") one is much more likely to benefit from genuine insights.<br><br>I have found this to be true. Therefore, not only do I make 10-15 minutes of journaling a recurring daily task, but, using FV, I consider myself to have done some action on a task if I write even a short sentence about it. <br><br>Writing, even uncensored freewriting, always forces greater structure and rigor on my thought. I now view writing as equally essential, if not more essential, than physical exercise.</div>

<div class="content">Two things I find help my journaling (I don't always use them, but I have them for when I'm stuck):<br><br>1. The topics du jour approach described at <a href="http://litemind.com/topics-du-jour/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://litemind.com/topics-du-jour/</a> . It at least brings those high-level things up to awareness.<br><br>2. A method described in the book "Writing the Mind Alive: The Proprioceptive Method for Finding Your Authentic Voice." The nut of the method is being specific with your language. If I write, "I get so bombarded by so many things every day," then I write "What do I mean by *things*?" Or, "I hate it when my daughter acts that way," then write "What do I mean by *that way*?" Basically -- get specific and write out your problem as if you were describing it to someone who doesn't know your situation. When you start challenging your mind's assumptions clustered around your own vague language, then the problem becomes more defined.<br><br>I wrote a little more about this book at my blog ( <a href="http://www.brownstudy.info/2008/12/30/on-specifying-your-terms/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.brownstudy.info/2008/12/30/on-specifying-your-terms/</a> ) but that's the gist.</div>

<div class="content">It's the text-to-speech voice recognition software that's built-in to Android. Any place you can do a keyboard entry, you can use text-to-speech. <br><br>As far as accuracy, it is OK at best. I only use it for my journal and on weekends. And I use it mainly for self-expression.

<div class="content">journaling is a VERY important part of my productivity and time-management toolset<br><br>like many who earn a living from creativity, i am a graduate of 'the artists way' and key to that program is writing your 'daily pages'.<br><br>as ive mentioned elsewhere on this site - i use a special notebook that has alternating blank and ruled sheets. i use the left-hand ruled pages for my 'daily pages' - a kind of journal and 'stream of consciousness' expression of my thoughts, ideas, feelings and dreams.<br><br>because these pages are interleaved with my AF pages, i find it easy to keep up (i hate to skip a page and leave it blank). some of the best 'action items' that i put into my AF list come directly from my writing in the journal pages.<br><br>ive tried doing his online (and blogging) but found that i missed the feel of handwriting and i also found myself worrying about the text being read by others - and so i started to put a bit of 'spin' into my journaling. whereas, i never share my handwritten journals and so i can be brutally honest and scathing and dont need to make it presentable i any way.<br><br>BTW; the blank page opposite my journaling is used for creative scheaming and scetching - mad ideas, inventions, funny cartoons or just plain old doodles - keeps the right-hemisphere running at top speed and is a great break from dull list-based AF stuff. and, as with the journal pages, i hate to leave my creative pages blank as i pregress through my book - so i am motivated to do my creative doodling several times a day.<br><br>on the flip side of those pages; i have my AF list on the right-hand ruled page and the left-hand blank page is used for job-related note-taking, planning and mind-maping. those pages are open before me at my desk and at meetings - they are serious work-related stuff. my journaling and creative pages are hidden behind them and are never seen by anyone.<br><br>having done this for years now, i have a collection of hard-backed books that have a treasure trove of sketches, plans, mind-maps, inventions, cartoons & inventions, plus a soul baring deeply personal journal of my journey through life. if i achieve nothing else, i will leave this legacy to posterity.<br><br>the notebook product i use is<br><br><a href="http://www.irishschoolbooks.ie/product.php?pid=2745&cat_id=15&subcat_id=89&subject_id=" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.irishschoolbooks.ie/product.php?pid=2745&cat_id=15&subcat_id=89&subject_id=</a><br><br>but i dont see books like this on sale in the US - which is a great pity<br><br>respect<br>paul</div>

<div class="content">Hi Zytex.  I love the idea of your system but the privacy issue is what concerns me.  You say that you don't like to post your most private thoughts in an online journal, so you prefer your notebook.  But if you carry it around to meetings, and everywhere you go, aren't you worried that some nosy-parker may read it if you mislay or lose it?  Keeping such journalling private is a big worry of mine, and one for which I can't think of a satisfactory solution.  I was also interested in the idea that your notebooks would be a legacy, but I'd be horrified at the thought of other people reading my most private journals, even after I'd gone!</div>

<div class="content">Margaret1<br><br>Privacy;<br>I use a very old-fashioned form of handwriting, small and decorous - a family tradition going back a few centuries - so it's not easy to just glance at a page and see what I've written - and I clearly label my books 'Private & Confidential' which provides legal protection - it's a crime to violate that (and socially equivelant to opening another persons private mail). All my friends and family know how important confidentiality is to me and how I would react if they trespassed. In work, my position and authority is such that I doubt anyone would do such a thing. But let's suppose they did: They cannot use the information without giving themselves away. And I have long ago given up concerning myself with what people think of me.<br><br>Legacy; <br>Most of my sketches and doodelings are meaningless - but there are a lot of clever inventions and some very funny cartoons in there - I love browsing back over my old books - not quite up there with Da Vinci's notebooks - but a similar feeling. When I'm dead; the world will discover a lot about my deviant life-style and crazy doings - a few honest notes in my journals will not make it any worse I suspect. And I'll be beyond caring at that point anyway. Plus I suspect posterity will have more interesting things to worry about than my journal's meanderings.<br><br>    --- "what has posterity ever done for us?" --- Sir Boyle Roche<br><br>But the huge benefit I get each day from those pages far out-weighs the 'risk'. And you can always invest in a notebook (or leather notebook holder) that has a lock - if that gives you the peace of mind you need to be truly honest in your pages.<br><br><br>Respect<br>Paul</div>

<div class="content">I have never been a journaller.  However, I recently filled a couple notebooks with research ideas and found that just using the book as a journal to think through ideas dramatically improved my ideas over any other method.  <br><br>This fact is one factor of why I'm altering my OneNote style away from what I've been doing for 3 years.  I intend to journal my way through the things I do in a day.  On one side I will have a growing list of things I have selected to do, and on the other I will have the things I did with notes to accompany them.  I'm hoping for similar benefits as per my research notes.</div>

<div class="content">I have a weird experience with journals.  Whenever I call it a "journal", I feel obligated to summarize the events and thoughts of the day.  But if I just keep a notebook, and free-write in there whenever and whatever I want, I find it so much more valuable -- both the process of writing, and the written result.</div>

<div class="content">Here is Sir Walter Scott in 1825, thinking along the same lines as Seraphim: 'I have all my life regretted that I did not keep a regular journal...I have bethought me on seeing lately some volumes of Byron's notes that he probably had hit on the right way of keeping such a memorandum-book by throwing aside all pretence to regularity and order and marking down events just as they occurred to recollection. I will try this plan and behold I have a handsome locked volume [suitable for a journal].'</div>

<div class="content">I love this thread! Lots of good ideas. Thanks to all who contributed. <br><br>I use 750 words to free write every morning first thing. I do it on my iPad before I get out of bed. For the past year, I have been mostly using it for a hybrid kind of [Mark Forster] Dreams dialogue -- except instead of talking with my future self, I decided to have a conversation with the Creator. This shift changed the dynamic of these conversations into a sort of prayer space, which has been enriching for me.<br><br>I keep the Dreams stuff on Evernote and I read (and update) my Vision before journaling. Then I go to 750 Words -- I really like the interface, which seems to promote journaling better than Evernote does (for me). It also keeps these private thoughts in a more private, separate space. But I am reconsidering the benefits of interweaving them more (thanks to this thread). (Note: I list what's better every night via the app IDoneThis.)<br><br>Although I find myself going I to Dreams Dialogue mode most days, sometimes I just free write whatever is on my mind. I give myself full freedom to use the space however I want, as long as I show up every day and fill the page. <br><br>Whenever my life goes off track -- usually this means I am sinking into depression and fatigue and life just feels like a treadmill -- this daily 750 Words writing is the single most important practice I can do to come back into balance. It draws me back into everything else I need. I have been doing this for years. Each year I manage to fall out of the habit several times -- and invariably go downhill in terms of my overall well being. And every time I return to this practice, I find myself living life more intentionally, I become happier, and I get drawn more closely to my Dream.</div>

<div class="content">Last week I learned of a new benefit of writing. Google Karpicke and Blunt. [Here's a summary:<br><a href="http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/pdf/quick_reviews/rp_062811.pdf" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/pdf/quick_reviews/rp_062811.pdf</a> }<br>They found that a specific writing technique was more effective for learning and remembering new material than the alternative techniques studied.<br><br>If you want to learn what you are reading (1) read it; (2) without looking at the text, write down everything you can think about the text for 10 minutes; (3) reread the text; (4) repeat step (2).<br><br>There is a "forgetting curve," so the longer you wait to write after reading, the less you will recall. But this suggests to me that daily journaling can improve learning. <br><br>The technical name for what Karpicke and Blunt study is "retrieval practice." I have no doubt that it is a great way to study, but it is very hard for me to break decades-old habit. If I am reading something that I want to remember, I will take notes as I read it. The research shows that I am being less-than-optimally effective when I do this. Mostly, I am copying and that does not involve a lot of engagement with the material. Forcing myself to take notes while taking a pause from reading is the better way to learn.</div>

<div class="content">I am certain that taking extensive notes in class reduces my effectiveness at learning because I am too busy forming words to think about what is said.  The same goes for book reading.  I would rather read a chapter then write what I learned - and then only the key points.  The second read can be more skimming searching for what I know I should know but failed to pick up.  In other words, try to fill the obvious gaps in my comprehension of the material.  <br><br>Interestingly, I suppose I picked this habit up from SRA reading labs in elementary school.  They give you a short story and then ask questions.  So I would read the story and answer the questions.  But of course I couldn't answer some questions and so had to return to the story to find those answers.  Then I go get another story.</div>

<div class="content">Victoria:<br><br>Byron - both in his letters and his journals - jettisoned all conventional punctuation - and just strung thoughts together with dashes - a very effective method of keeping your thoughts going - though not always all that easy for the reader to follow - but then who cares about the reader if the purpose is your own benefit? - comprehension is only necessary if there's a third party involved - Pepys of course put his diary in cypher so no one could understand it except himself - and when you see some of the content you can see why - he wouldn't have wanted his wife to find it!</div>

<div class="content">I find taking notes helps me learn. If the lecture is slow enough, it helps me pay attention, while I think about key points and how the content relates to itself and other things. If the lecture's fast, I focus on getting it down, then learn it later. Only the new words get written neatly, sentence structure is non-existent, and sometimes I need to review and annotate them within a few days, or even call a friend: "What do you think this bit means?" But at least I knew there was something I needed to fill in.<br><br>My senior English teacher wanted us to take lecture notes in full-sentence form, in pen, and he wanted to mark them. I told him that my lecture notes were for my own use. If he wanted to mark something, I would write notes about his lectures as an assignment. Also, if we couldn't write proper sentences by then, there was something wrong. The science classes taught how to take notes quickly. There's a lot of information presented in little time.</div>

<div class="content">I use Byword for freewriting, a wonderful and simple texteditor (with markdown support). Via View -> Show Counters you can turn on the word counting at the bottom of the display.</div>

<div class="content">I’ve tried 750 as well, Moises. But it’s a bit hard to maintain. Instead, I’ve switch to Jim Collins system from the Tim Ferris’s podcast. I’m currently testing it with my classmates from school.<br><br>I use SMS for the following 3 questions:<br>1. On a scale of -2 to +2 how was your day?<br>2. How many hours did you spend in flow state?<br>3. Write one sentence summary of your day.<br><br>I log the answers in an excel sheet, then generate a report every 2 weeks to give insights on what creates their best and worst days :)<br><br>It’s surprisingly powerful. I now understand why Jim uses it.<br>Also, I think finding the right notebook, for a handwritten journal, is a big plus.<br>I like Midori.</div>

<div class="content">Hi everyone,<br><br>check out this Large Journal with Blank Paper: Efficiently plan and organize your life. Can be used as a Notebook, for Drawing, Doodling, Pencil Sketching, Writing, Journaling, Artwork, or even as a Garden Journal. We each have our own ways of expressing ourselves and if you are more drawn to doodles than words, then so be it. Set aside some time each day to sit down and sketch whatever comes to mind. This book is a great way to record artistic progress. If you’re looking for a written record of your thoughts and feelings to look back on over the next few decades (or to share with others in the future) then this Sketch Book is right for you! It contains three lines at the bottom of every other page to capture your thoughts and feelings.<br><br>https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08F6J83YF</div>
