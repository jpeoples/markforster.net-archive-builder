<div class="content">Hi Folks!<br><br>Excited to find a forum dedicated to the topic of time management.<br><br>As a physician entrepreneur, I face the challenge of managing my time day-to-day.<br><br>Especially as I've made a commitment to myself not to sacrifice my health on the way to becoming successful, my daily challenge consists of finding time to eat right, sleep well, and exercise, among other wellness priorities (i.e. meditation, yoga, spending time with family and friends).<br><br>In the process, I found it best to have a Visual and Fun way to plan my day, in a way designed to emphasize wellness goals alongside work and play.  <br><br>The result is Owaves (<a href="http://www.owaves.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.owaves.com</a> ).  It's helping me tremendously, and it may help y'all as well.<br><br>Meanwhile, would love to learn what apps people find most useful.  And if anyone has tried Owaves or heard of it before, any level of feedback or suggestions would be appreciated!<br><br>Kind Regards,<br><br>Royan</div>

<div class="content">I'mma give you a tip here - you probably shouldn't promote your app by bumping two year-old threads with the same link you posted here.</div>

<div class="content">Royan:<br><br>I've no objection to having commercial messages here as long as they are relevant to the theme of this blog - in fact I even adjusted your links myself so they worked. <br><br>But please don't post irrelevant or repetitious messages. You are welcome to keep us informed about the development of your project and answer any queries about it.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Royan, <br><br>I haven't used Owaves as such but had been using other applications such as Harvest and Replicon.<br><br>Harvest has been a great tool but still it has few deficiencies such as downtime and speed that led me to continue with Replicon time management software - <a href="http://www.replicon.com/olp/time-management-software.aspx" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.replicon.com/olp/time-management-software.aspx</a><br><br>It is really a simple and hassle free cloud based application that can be accessed from anywhere using a web browser. At the same time, it can be easily used as an integrated tool with QuickBooks. Had no issues with this application till date.</div>

<div class="content">There was something immediately appealing to me about the circular colorful design. The circle makes a lot of sense for the time period of the day (it allows you to show proportions betters, including sleep, and it lines up with the turning of the earth, so you can show where sunrise and sunset are, for example), and I have been thinking more about what times of day one does things that they want to do daily. <br><br>For example, I started tracking whether or not I exercised (walking ~40 minutes) each day (as seen on The X Effect subreddit here: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/theXeffect/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.reddit.com/r/theXeffect/</a> ). At first I would fail to do it if I worked too long on that day.  But then I started walking right after work because I wanted to get outside before it got too dark, and enjoy the cooler weather and views of the sunset, even if I had worked late.  And now it has become a habit to go on a walk every day after work, and even on the weekend I go outside when it is starting to get dark. (I wonder what will happen in the winter and Daylight Saving Time kicks in and sunset is at 5pm instead of 7pm).<br><br>Even though the tracking technique doesn't require you to use routines, I fell into one. Also some books I've read recently suggest that you create routines, such as a morning routine to get you energized and then work on something specific for an hour every morning (such as writing books, if you are an author).<br><br>I was going to try this program on my iPod touch or iPhone but it is iPad only.  The UI looks like it could easily fit on a phone, so maybe that could be done without too high of a level of effort (compared to, say, the Android version).</div>

<div class="content">FlyLady points out that much of what we do is a routine, and usually an unplanned and not very good routine. Leaving your clothes in the basket while you do something else in the evening, then ironing them in the morning while running late, is a routine. I definitely find routines help me get things done, and have difficulty getting things done if they don't fit into one.</div>
