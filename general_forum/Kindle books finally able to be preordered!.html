<div class="content">Presumably because Amazon and the publisher Hachette have finally made a new agreement, these three ebooks are now able to be preordered on Amazon's US site: Get Everything Done, How To Make Your Dreams Come True, and Do It Tomorrow. The release date is showing as November 27. I've been checking on them periodically for months--so excited!</div>

<div class="content">Nothing to do with the agreement. The issue of the ebooks has been planned for months, including new designs for the covers. Contents the same though!</div>

<div class="content">The GED and DIT books are now on my Kindle! I do have paper copies of all three books, but I like the opportunity to have them with me on a regular basis. I'll certainly reread them in the near future.</div>
