<div class="content">In SF, I've been using the left page for home items and right page for work one.  The one issue is that these lists grow at different rates, so my "current pages" with my key column two lists are at different places in the notebook.  Anyone else have that issue?  Anyone have a different solution?  Not a huge issue, but I do like to have everything that is urgent today available at a glance.  It also gets a liitle tricky adding new items to different pages depending on whether they are home or work.  Thanks.</div>

<div class="content">Yeah, I ran into the same issue.  So now I write both personal and work items on the same page.  <br><br>In column 1, here is what I do:   I write work tasks starting from the top of the page, going down.  I write personal tasks starting from the bottom of the page, going up.  When they meet, I draw a very heavy line to separate them.   <br><br>For column 2, I just mix them both in together -- though you could use the same top-down, bottom-up approach for column 2 if you wanted.  I just find it adds needless complexity.<br><br>What happens if I am "working" and I come to a page with only personal items in Column 1?   (OR vice-versa.)   Usually I can take some small incidental action and it serves as a nice short break.  But if I can't take any action, then I follow the rules and dismiss the lot of them.  Dismiss doesn't mean they disappear -- it just means I need to figure out why they are getting dismissed.   Sometimes it means I need to take a day off from work to deal with the backlog of personal items (or vice-versa, I need to work some overtime).   Sometimes it means I need to audit my commitments to see why this is happening.   What's nice is the "review dismissed items" process takes care of that already -- I don't need a new special process.<br><br>What happens if I am working and come to a personal item in Column 2?   Again, if I can take a short break to take some action on that task, all is well.   But if I really can't do it right now because I need to focus on work, then I just move it forward.   This is in accordance with Mark's tip, if you physically can't do something in Column 2, then move it forward.<br><br>I've been doing this for about a week and it's been working pretty well.</div>

<div class="content">Excellent - thanks Seraphim!  I will try your approach.</div>

<div class="content">I interleave home and work tasks. At a practical level, I haven't faced the problems you describe Scott.<br><br>I mark Home and Work pages and flip through those that are not relevant to reach the next relevant page. Not yet a problem for me.<br><br>I didn't like combining both because of the extra bit of thinking and re-writing required to move a C2 task that I couldn't tackle.</div>

<div class="content">JD - How do you handle Column 2 tasks?   When I was handling Home and Work pages like that, I found that C2 would lose its momentum whenever I switched contexts.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim,<br><br>Glad to hear that you went back to the "cave deposits" method of home/work task separation. I've been doing that with AF/DWM/SF, since you (?) first described it, and like how it separates the items on each page at an easy glance. Alternating pages didn't seem like a viable strategy for SF.<br><br>I'm also glad to hear that you have found that dismissing a whole bunch of out-of-context tasks hasn't caused a major issue. Haven't gotten to dismissal yet with SF, but it's imminent!</div>

<div class="content">@Scott: I've toyed with the cave deposit technique.<br><br>In an effort to keep home and work tasks separate, but accessible, I use the front of my notebook for work, flip it over and use the back ('upside down') for personal.<br><br>When on an assignment abroad, I try to confine the work list to the current assignment and use the personal list for everything else, even stuff for future assignments, development etc.<br><br>Due to the assignment context - away from home - there are fewer personal tasks, so the mix of home and work tasks is tolerable, for me.</div>

<div class="content"><<When I was handling Home and Work pages like that, I found that C2 would lose its momentum whenever I switched contexts>><br><br>Seraphim: I haven't faced that yet. If I decide to do some home tasks during work time I obviously have to make a careful assesment of how much time I have so that I don't end up with too many C2 tasks on a page that I can't complete before leaving to go to the next home page. Consequently, smaller home tasks inevitably stand out for me at work.<br><br>Once I am done, I just return to the work page I was on and carry on from where I left off.</div>
