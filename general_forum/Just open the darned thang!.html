<div class="content">I am back to using AF1. For me it is the best version because it makes sure that I spend most of my time doing the important stuff rather than the urgent stuff.<br><br>However, and this is a problem I have had with all versions, I quite often find it very difficult to just open the AF list at the start of the working day. Consequently, I can "waste" hours before I finally get round to opening the Autofocus book.<br><br>But I have noticed recently that a tweak has occurred that I didn't consciously introduce... Every morning I must use my asthma inhaler. I often forgot to do this, so I added it to my AF list. Now, when I use my asthma inhaler in the morning (which has become a habit thanks to AF), I have to cross it off my list and reenter it for tomorrow. Somehow the two actions have become inextricably linked -- I can't do the one without doing the other.<br><br>When I cross "Inhaler" off the list in the morning, I then work from that point, using AF1 rules, rather than go back to the point where I left off yesterday (I always forgot where I got to, anyway, and posted about that months ago). This ensures that the urgent stuff gets done early, which overcomes any panic I might feel if I am not cycling round the rest of the list fast enough. Occasionally, I get stuck at the most recent end of the list, and if I notice this and feel it is undesirable, I will force myself back to the oldest page of the list.<br><br>So, if you have trouble starting on your list at the beginning of the day, find something you do every morning, add it to the list, and hopefully it will become linked in the same way as for me.<br><br>HTH,<br>Wooba</div>

<div class="content">Also, when processing the list has become a habit you can use that to help build other habits.<br><br>Currently though i'm in a mood wherein using AF isn't standing out for me. How is that when every thing I need to do is in my list? Well what's happening is I have some broad and deep questions i'm puzzling out, and this puzzling requires sustained focus. (I believe). <br><br>So following autofocus doesn't seem appropriate now. The upshot of this is I am NOT productive in the usual sense. I am doing some things I know need doing, but other things are not done as well as they might. Yet I think it's worth it because if my thinking bears fruit it will achieve lasting benefits for work in the upcoming year. This is in contrast to my regular work which gets things done only to start other things, where the cumulative impact is significant but the marginal increments are small. <br><br>Related to this thread, I wonder what becomes of the AUTOFOCUS habit?</div>

<div class="content">Alan - I also had the "sustained focus" problem with AF, and still have it (but to a lesser degree) with DWM.  I feel a bit overwhelmed by the many small tasks on my list, and their nagging prevents me from really focusing on the items that need sustained focus.  <br><br>Problem is, many of those "small" tasks require up to an hour or two of work, and it doesn't really make sense to break them any smaller.  So if I work the "scut" following the DWM standing-out rules, I never get around to the important work that needs the sustained focus.  <br><br>I really *could* forego much of the scut -- it doesn't NEED my immediate attention -- and maybe it doesn't need my attention at all.  It could wait a few days, even a week or two, or forever.  <br><br>But seeing it there on my list just distracts me, especially if it's in the <1W "hot zone".  Sometimes to get rid of them, I push them out back to Today+30 (or even later), if I know they can really wait -- but then, I am not availing myself of the excellent DWM dismissal process.<br><br>Sometimes I also just delete them, if I am willing to let it go, or realize it must be let go, or just get frustrated with having it niggle at me.   <br><br>I wish I had a "hide this today" button, which would take the item off my list for today, then put it right back the next day, preserving its standard DWM expiration date, so it keeps moving closer to dismissal.  <br><br>Since I'm using Outlook, I suppose I could just tag all those items as "scut", and work the "scut" in a timed burst, say 30 minutes first thing, like Learning does...  And after that, I could hide the "scut" category so it doesn't distract...  Hmm...   That sounds like it could work.</div>
