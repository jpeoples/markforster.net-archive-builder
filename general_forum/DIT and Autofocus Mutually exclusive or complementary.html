<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br>  I've been following DIT for over a month now, at least, partially. I read through the instructions for Autofocus and can't help but wonder if these two systems are mutually exclusive or complement each other. Let me give you a scenario:<br>  DIT works on the principle of closed lists and the fact that the incoming work and outgoing work has to be equal on an average. I can see how the closed list principle is used here when one finishes 'standing out' items on one page before moving on to the next. However, how is the second principle of DIT handled in Autofocus? <br><br>  The other nice thing I liked about DIT is that for most tasks, it is predictable that I will get to them the next day after they arrived on my inbox. In Autofocus, I think we loose that predictability.<br><br>  And, finally, DIT makes it easy to do an audit if one lags behind, i.e. it makes it easy to see that one is lagging behind. How can this be achieved with Autofocus?<br><br>  These are thoughts that popped up after reading the instructions. Consistent usage will tell how it fares.<br><br>  One thing that might help me and others is if you could tell us to whom you'd recommend DIT and to whom you'd recommend Autofocus.<br><br>Siva<br></div>

<div class="content">Siva<br><br>It's no use trying to compare DIT and Autofocus. They work on completely different principles - though admittedly some of them overlap a bit. <br><br>Basically I think I would recommend Autofocus to everyone.</div>

<div class="content">Mark, one of the biggest advantages of DIT is that it lets me know when I'm "done" for the day. That seems to be lacking in Autofocus. Any thoughts on that? (Apologies if that's already been addressed later in the forums; I haven't read everything yet.)</div>
