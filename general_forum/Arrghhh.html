<div class="content">Arrghhh, I forgot my SuperFocus notebook in Holland. I'm going to be without my lifeline for three days :-S.<br><br>The resulting anxiety reveals two things:<br>* SF clearly helps at making my life structured and efficient<br>* Unfortunately I also depend on it</div>

<div class="content">What I suggest you do is to construct a temporary list of those things which you know you need to do while away from your notebook. After three days working it you will have most of your current concerns on it. When you are re-united with your notebook, you can either update the old list from the new list - or possibly even vice versa.</div>

<div class="content">Tijl,<br><br>If I were in this situation, I would do the following:<br><br>1. Buy a new notebook (a nice one, if possible).<br>2. Enter a task to dismiss the pages in the old notebook.<br>3. Enter a task to review the dismissed tasks in the old notebook.<br>4. Relax and trust that any important or urgent tasks will come to mind, and just enter them in the new notebook as they do.<br><br>And then, when you get back, you will probably be surprised how many of the old-notebook tasks are already done or reentered from your memory, so there won't be that many left to dismiss/review/reenter.<br><br>Enjoy your trip!</div>

<div class="content">What I would suggest would be to make your list digital and synschronized. May be with Taskpaper or any other tool.</div>
