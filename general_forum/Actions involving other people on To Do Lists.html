<div class="content">Mark<br><br>I found your article on "To Do Lists -- How We Hate Them" very useful, and am trying to put it into practise.<br><br>What happens when you have something to do that also needs input from someone else, e.g. I need to arrange a meeting, so I set a date in my Lotus Notes calendar, check invitee availability, and give the details to the administrator to book a room. The task is not complete until she has forwarded the booking confirmation (which can take quite a few hours to come through to her) and I have added the location to Lotus Notes. <br><br>It can be quite frustrating knowing that you have done all you can, but still can't cross the task off!<br>If I just put down my part of the task, and the booking confirmation never comes through, I might forget to chase it up if it is not on the list.</div>

<div class="content">Dear Catherine<br>I would just add 'follow up' note on a suitable day in the future - leaving enough time to chase if necessary.<br><br>Often I find that by the time the follow up date comes around, the task has been completed satisfactorialy and all you have to do is delete it from your list.  <br><br>Not sure if this is what Mark would recommend but it means that you make inroads on the day's list straight away!<br><br>D</div>
