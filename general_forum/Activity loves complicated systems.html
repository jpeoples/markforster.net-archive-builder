<div class="content">I love the distinction between action and activity on the current home page of this site. From my own experience, I know this is absolutely true. And from some statements here in the discussion forum I have the impression that those who wrote them simply still cling to activity in order to avoid to take real action – and once you're in that mode, you shy away from simplicity. I know it from my personal history of procrastination and my periods of obsessive methodology. It's the complicated system that appeals to you, the system with the sophisticated file system, a zillion tags and reference systems, the system that needs a sophisticated software solution and - most important of all - is able to keep you busy the whole day organizing your tasks without any of it getting done. (Most of what I read from GTD adepts on the net falls into this category, too.)<br><br>Imagine some bad guys came into your house, put a gun to your head and set you a deadline: Until then-and-then, you will have to complete this-and-this tasks, otherwise they will do nasty things to you, your wife and your children. And it's no joke, it's real pressure. You ABSOLUTELY have to get these things DONE.<br><br>How would you do it? Would you really start up any piece of software and begin by feeding all these tasks into it? At least I wouldn't. If I were in real pressure, I'd grab some large, cheap notebook, some pen, jot everything down that's in my mind and then I would simply START DOING THINGS.<br><br>The way you act once you're under real pressure is the way of acting that suits you – even without the pressure.<br><br>I think the main point is to become aware of one's clinging to activity. Once you let that go, you're half there.</div>

<div class="content">Andrea - that is a great post.<br><br>I have to tell you though - I was able to finally start checking items off my list once I had a place to write down every single thing that was driving me nuts!  My mind started to clear and Mark's methods for dealing with my list got me moving.</div>

<div class="content">Mary -<br><br>maybe there is a reason why one clings to activity, and maybe that reason is fear. The fear not be able to handle all this stuff. As soon as something happens that gives relief from this fear - for example, you give a simple system a try and you start getting things handled - the fear has a chance to evaporate.<br><br>As far as AF is concerned, it is of utmost importance (and should be stressed in discussions "about" the system again and again) to actually really TRY IT OUT. Just to have a look at something isn't enough to be able to judge it. Just like it's rarely enough to read a recipe to know how a meal tastes - you have to eat it. At least a spoon full of it.<br><br>I would not go so far to demand that everybody who comments here swears an oath that he has used AF for at least 3 weeks EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED - but on the other hand... :-)</div>

<div class="content">This is exactly why (or at least one reason why) I like Autofocus so much. It is a very natural system. It takes the gun-to-the-head approach, and systematizes and extends it to cover all of your discretionary time. <br><br>Granted, "WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO NEXT SO THEY DON'T SHOOT ME???" is a bit different from "do whatever stands out", but somehow the two concepts seem to be connected at some deep level. In both cases, one would gravitate to the task that you CAN do next, and that FEELS RIGHT to do next. There's just more pressure in the gun-to-the-head case, to TAKE ACTION NOW.<br><br>With every other TM system I've used, whenever there was any extraordinary deadline pressure, or some other kind of overwhelm, I'd be forced to abandon the system and go into "emergency mode" to deal with the overwhelming situation: make a short list, bang through it as quick as possible, don't think about anything else. When the dust clears, I could go back to my TM-system-of-the-month, but it would always be difficult to remember how it all worked, how it all fit together, and where I should start again.<br><br>With Autofocus, dealing with these overwhelming situations is actually pretty easy, and fits right into the system. I can just add all the pressing tasks to the end of my list, and then start working on them right away, jumping straight to that page. I stay focused on them, working the AF system as normal, till the crisis has cleared. And then, I can relax and just start working through the system as normal, treating all these new tasks (if any loose ends remain) as any other task in the system. <br><br>I am quickly finding the easiest default behavior is just use the AF list. Easy to capture new tasks. Easy to review existing tasks. Easy to get started up again after a week full of meetings or emergencies. Overwhelm and pressure actually drive me to my list now, rather than driving me to panic and abandon my system. <br></div>

<div class="content">By the same token, haven't you found that being overly introspective is also often a sign of less activity / progression?  Is over-analyzing the why's of procrastination just another reason (excuse) not to move forward?<br><br>I used to be this way, but it's possible to change, thank goodness.<br><br>Here's an excerpt from an interesting course I was at last year:<br><br><a href="http://www.dfcs.dhr.georgia.gov/DHR-DFCS/DHR_DFCS-Edu/Files/Communication%20Styles%20Assessment.doc" rel="nofollow">http://www.dfcs.dhr.georgia.gov/DHR-DFCS/DHR_DFCS-Edu/Files/Communication%20Styles%20Assessment.doc</a><br><br></div>

<div class="content">@Jacqueline:  If analyzing the whys and wherefores of one's procrastination leads one to *overcome* the procrastination (as AF tends to do), then I say it's a good thing.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Seraphim,<br>I agree on the analysis to the point of finding a solution -  everyone on this forum is actively working on a system to reduce their procrastination, so they probably aren't analyzing at the expense of doing.  <br>I just know that 10 years ago when I was having problems with procrastination and reading all the self-help noise out there about "fear of failure / fear of success" and all that stuff , it was counter productive.  Spending more time looking at the "hows" though can be very helpful - and sometimes you have to identify the "why" before you figure out the how.<br>For example, if I am avoiding something because it feels overwhelming, *little and often* and *just starting* will usually get you going.</div>

<div class="content">I was thinking about the topic Andreas raised earlier and recalled some things I had read about Richard Branson some time ago (and I would argue he's got a lot of stuff done in his life) - anyway here's an excerpt of an article:<br><br>According to Branson, “it’s the attention to detail that really defines great business delivery.” It’s that simple. He advises every company owner or manager to travel with a notebook to jot down things that need doing. It doesn’t matter what you’re doing – whether you’re listening to staff or customers, inspecting your product, or even just wandering through your office – it all needs to be captured in the notebook. Or else you’ll forget it.<br><br>I was also thinking about the project management systems that people here on this and other forums use.  I used to work at one of the world's largest Engineering, Procurement & Construction companies in the world in a department with nothing but engineers.  The most productive guy I knew was my 60+ y.o. boss who worked only with pen and paper, but who could understand and explain the basics and the big picture better than anyone I've met.  Multi-billion dollar projects and management of hundreds or thousands of workers are what usually require these elaborate project management methods, not most people's work lives.  <br><br>Or maybe like Richard Branson and my old boss, I just want to keep it simple sweetheart so I don't clutter my head with all that noise.</div>

<div class="content">As Mary said, that very act of having a single place to write "everything" down really does "clear the mind"  To me having a list with say 500 things to do is somehow far less threatening that just that vague cloud that you know contains any number of things but don't know what.  The very act of quantifying gives clarity.<br><br>Like Jacqueline I have devoured numerous books on Time management and Organization but the method of analysis of procrastination seems to me to be completely different.  Books, course etc in that past may have identified my "problem" and may have provided me with the tools.  AF is the only system that somehow has provided me with the additional insight to see exactly what tools to use and when and how.</div>

<div class="content">Andreas: I completely agree. I have experienced that when I just grab any sheet of paper, a pen, jot down a small todo list and start cracking, I put out more work compared with using an elaborate system.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine, I think that, although authors on procrastination may have been very well meaning and based their systems to defeat procrastination on *logic*, the key is that they didn't present a solution that worked for you - or me - or a lot of other people now using AF with success.   Variety, choice, automatic consideration of energy level, immediate reward, the mysterious quelling of the rebel within us all - it still all seems surreal to me.  I think that happens when your self-concept begins to change, when you find that something you've been telling yourself for a long time simply isn't true.  Things like "I am a procrastinator."   <br>Not trying to be hokey, or woo-woo, but sometimes I feel like on Jan. 5 I took the red pill.  Mark played Morpheus in the Matrix and I trusted him and jumped.  <br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br><br>I have to say that reading your last para I really did LOL! That is just so true!  A couple of years ago I read an article about "being in the flow" (still have problems with that phrase!) which talked about doing what you wanted as the means of getting to that point.  I felt "in the flow" for oh, maybe an hour or two (albeit not consistently, and it felt great.  Trouble was I had no idea how I had gotten there or how to sustain it or even identify exactly what it was.  On Jan 5, within a few minutes I "got" AF - because it did all of that and more - but incredibly also provided the system and framework for sustainability.  The learning curve comes from trusting the process and gradually identifying exactly what we have been fooled by all these years.  You know the Matrix analogy is pretty apt when you think about it .........:-)<br><br>It is so hard to explain what AF really does without sounding woo-woo - there is so much really weird stuff being written these days, some of which really is woo-woo, and it is not easy to explain that it is "not just a to do list" ......... It does seem surreal but it's certainly fun!  I can't quite believe I have stuck with a system, consistently, for nearly two months ....... unbelievable!!!</div>

<div class="content">What is AF? It's a system for writing down and doing things.<br>How do you do AF? Follow Mark's instructions.<br>Why is it useful to do AF?<br><br>This question does not have an easy answer. AndreasE's first post in this thread helped me identify why AF is so good. <br><br>First, let's figure one reason which is not a reason why I do AF.<br><br>I don't do AF because it is the best way to organize lists of stuff that I have committed myself to doing. There really are much better ways to organize this stuff. Various kinds of lists, outliners, and project planning systems are better than AF.<br><br>I don't do AF because it is the most efficient way to keep track of my commitments. It's not.<br><br>I do AF because it's the best way so far to keep me motivated. AndreasE asks us to imagine someone putting a gun to our head and threatening us and our family with murder. OK. I am imagining that. Now the gun-wielding threatener tells me to do something. What will I do? Will I start surfing the web? Will I decide that now would be a good time to sort through those old photos in my bottom draw? Will I tell myself that I'll do just what this guy with the gun says after I wash the dishes? No. I will probably try to do whatever this guy is asking me to do. If the assignment he gives me is highly complex and will take many days of sustained effort, I will use complex software with tags and means for tracking dependencies.<br><br>What does AndreasE's thought experiment teach me? It teaches me that AF is probably of no use to me when there is a gun at my head because AF's key virtue is that it can keep me working actively when there is no gun at my head. <br><br>I am highly motivated when there is a gun at my head. Fortunately (unfortunately?), I have never worked with a gun at my head. And that is the problem. It's hard to stay motivated over weeks and months when the gun is gone. <br><br>Why is AF good? AF is good because it keeps me motivated even when there is no gun. Be sure of one thing: if someone put a gun to my head, the last thing I would be doing is AF.  (Let's imagine using AF in the presence of the gun. "This guy wants me to drive him to Decatur. OK. I'll put that at the end of my list. But right now, I am still on page 26. Let's see, this assignment that's due in six months is standing out. Let's work on it for a few minutes.")<br></div>

<div class="content">@ moises -- I don't know -- it still seems to me that Autofocus works very much like the gun-to-the-head thing, particularly when operating under any kind of pressure.  You could put the "drive to Decatur" at the end of your list, then make a command decision to jump to the end of the list and start working it right there.  Seems to me the "gun-to-the-head" items would be the ones to stand out.  To help make sure they stand out, instead of writing a due-date at the right margin, you could draw a little gun.  Might help keep you focused.  But besides these two very minor modifications (both of which seem completely in the spirit of Autofocus), seems to me Autofocus could handle this kind of situation very well.</div>

<div class="content">Might rather be AF is not putting a gun to your head, but some sweetie before your mouth. It's more about fun than about fear, and that's what makes it strong: All of a sudden, work becomes fun!<br><br>And if anything, fun is stronger than fear. That's the reason mother nature based our procreational behaviour on fun, I assume.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-03-3 12:11</div>
<div class="content">Moises:<br><br>I'm not myself convinced that your "gun-to-the-head" analogy is right. If the gunman just wanted you to drive him to Decatur, that would fall under the commonsense rule "If it needs doing now, do it now".<br><br>But if it is "highly complex and will take many days of sustained effort", then I can't imagine a better way of organising it than AF. I would of course start a new AF list which would include only those things relating to the task, but that's quite within the rules as it would count as a new location. <br><br>The point being that AF enables us to integrate the many factors which are involved in our work better than we are able to do rationally without its help. And the fact that we have a gun to our head would definitely be one of those factors!</div>

<div class="content">But what Moises says hits the nail on the head, at least in my case: I used to be effective and performant under pressure - but without pressure, my performance used to go down drastically. With AF, it is the first time that this has changed - my performance is even improving in no-pressure situations. And that is because it is fun to work along the list. Just my 2 cts.<br>Wolfgang</div>

<div class="meta">2009-03-3 15:03</div>
<div class="content">Wowi:<br><br>Yes, I agree with what Moises says otherwise. It was Andreas' analogy rather than Moises'. I guess what I really mean is that AF will work both when I have a gun to my head and when I haven't!</div>
