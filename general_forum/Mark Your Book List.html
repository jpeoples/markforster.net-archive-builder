<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>One of the examples you listed was a list of books you wanted to read which you filtered down to 3 with your system.  What did you do with the books that you did not choose?  Did you highlight all of them for future reference or just cross them off as never to be done?  Why?<br><br>Strathy</div>

<div class="content">Strathy:<br><br>They were just treated like normal tasks. When I went back to the page they were on and none stood out on the first pass, I dismissed all of them in the normal way, i.e. by highlighting them and closing the page with a X.<br><br>So they are all still sitting there on the page highlighted so I can review them easily.</div>
