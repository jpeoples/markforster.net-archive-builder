<div class="content">I was reluctant to post this since I havent even made use of timed bursts NOR of my new gadget yet, but finally thought I would share anyway :<br><br>I just purchased a GYMBOSS, mainly as a fitness tool. Its an interval timer, which primary intent is to be used for any kind of interval training where you alternate between 2 (differently) timed work and rest periods for a set number of "rounds" (HIIT, Tabata, shadow boxing/sparring, etc). It can also serve as a stop watch. <br>You can use different kind of alarms (any combination of loud/low volume beep of selectable length or none, vibrator on/off), which make it usable in any situation.<br><br>I have been wanting to make use of timed bursts of work to help with my chronic procrastination/focus problems (I'm probably ADD) but never got around to it (kept procrastinating...). Now I have a tool to  do this easily!<br><br>Ok, i just checked their webpage again, and they now have a more expensive version that, among other features, lets you set up up to 25 different intervals vs just 2, and let you save up to 15 different programs!!! Looks like this would be great for Mark's suggestions of timed burts which can have more than 2 different intervals. I wish I got this one instead!<br><br>Here a copy/paste from the website : <br><br>GYMBOSS FEATURES<br><br>    * 1 or 2 intervals - 2 seconds to 99 minutes<br>    * Repeat up to 99 times<br>    * Beep and/or Vibrate alarm<br>    * Alarm duration 1, 5, or 10 seconds<br>    * Stopwatch function<br>    * Secure Belt clip<br>    * Compact Size (1 ¾ x 2 ¼ x ½ inches)<br>    * Water and shock resistant<br>    * AAA battery required<br><br>GYMBOSS MAX FEATURES<br><br>    * Up to 25 different intervals<br>    * Repeat groups up to 99 times<br>    * Save up to 15 programs<br>    * LCD Backlit screen<br>    * Alarm by beep, vibration or both<br>    * Alarm duration of 1, 2, 5, 9 seconds<br>    * Belt clip<br>    * Water and shock resistant<br>    * 1 year warranty<br><br>Please not that I am NOT in any way affiliated to this company, I just thought it would be a good find to share with the people of this forum since the primary intent of this product isnt to be used as a time management helping tool!<br><br>EDIT:<br>I used the gymboss.eu site to order mine but it only proposes the regular version. Only the gymboss.com offers the MAX version as well (but still offers worldwide shipping for the same cheap price), which is why i missed it.</div>
