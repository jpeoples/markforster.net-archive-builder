<div class="content">I have found both UTMS (the original version) and FV to be very effective.  For my personality and style of working, UTMS is a better fit and has proven to be the best of Mark's systems for me.<br><br>I think that UTMSI adds too much resistance without significantly improving UTMS.</div>

<div class="content">I'm going to correct myself that it's probably too early to say UTMS is better than FV for me.  It has some clear advantages: I like having one task selected at a time, and it gets unfinished things finished.  However, FV has a lot of advantages and has worked well for me for a long time, so I think it's too early to say which is better overall.</div>

<div class="content">UTMSI is working well except my ridiculously long "new" list. It has been awhile since I used FV, it worked too but in a different way. Best thing about UTMS, either one, is things get finished, even if ever so slowly.</div>

<div class="content">I have concluded that overall FV is the best system for me, but UTMS is an *excellent* system that does have a couple advantages over FV.</div>
