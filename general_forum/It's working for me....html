<div class="content">I'd just like to say, the new system is working for me.  I normally work full-time and use a similar system, however, I'm at home at the moment and have been using daily routines and the task diary.  Life has been very dull and I've found that I've been doing some tasks every day and not even starting others!  The new system is allowing me to touch on everything which is a great feeling.  I feel as if I have done far more than normal.<br><br>I even thought I might apply it to my love life!<br><br>Thanks Mark</div>
