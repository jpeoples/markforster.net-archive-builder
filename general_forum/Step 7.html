<div class="content">"If you go to a page and no item stands out for you on your first pass through it, then all the outstanding items on that page are dismissed"<br><br>Problem: I tend to do computer oriented work at home, and everything else in coffee shops. Some of my pages have only "computer oriented" tasks left to do. When I'm at a coffee shop, and I stumble onto one of those pages, I "should" dismiss those items. <br><br>Of course I can tell myself "ah, computer items, do those when you get home". But it seems to defeat the purpose of the AF system. <br><br>Have any of you run into this scenario? How do you deal with it?</div>

<div class="content">My proposition is to dismiss what is related to your current (GTD)context, and thus was dismissable according the rules.  I think it is best not  to wait indefinitely for the perfect situation where everything can be processed before dismissing a page as a whole.</div>

<div class="content">What's the point of dismissal in Autofocus?  In my opinion, it's to filter out those things that you thought at the time you entered them that you *should* be doing, but which you really don't have to do - and don't really want to do.  <br><br>I don't dismiss when I run into the situation you describe which I have quite regularly, whether it's due to weather (can't wash the car when it's -20), timing (a page left with only tasks that require a larger time commitment than I have available from Monday-Friday after work or stores aren't open) or, like your situation, where they are location specific items.  With regards to the location specific items, when I enter steps on a project that I'm working on in a batch, that could amount to a full page of items, yet I may only be in that location once a week or less.   You can bet that the next time I'm in that location, I'll be working exclusively from those location-specific pages though.  In theory, you could write down an item / project "computer tasks" and have a separate context list, but why bother with the overhead?<br><br>I run into the same situation when I'm at work doing items from my home book during my lunch hour or on my commute.  For me, it's progress that I do anything at all from my home book during my working day, so I just cherry pick something on any of the pages that I feel like doing.  <br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">I agree wholeheartedly with Jacqueline.  Just because one cannot do items on the lists due to location or not having the appropriate tools at hand or whatever, I do not believe that means the tasks should be dismissed.  When that happens to me, I simply acknowledge that I cannot do those tasks where I am at the moment and go on to the next page.  I do not dismiss them.<br><br>Best wishes to All,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Of course what we are all doing is trying to find the right system for us, and therefore developing your own rules about dismissing is perfectly legitimate.<br><br>However it's important to remember that when you change a rule you also change the way your intuition approaches the list as a whole. If your rule is that you will only dismiss an item if it relates to your current context, then that is going to affect how you approach that item on previous passes through that page, and consequently how you approach the other items on the same page. And because your intuition is looking at the list as a whole as well as the page you are currently on, the rule change will affect the way you approach every item on the list.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>I am curious -- how do you approach tasks on your lists when you are at a place where they cannot be done -- or do not have the tools, or whatever?  Do you dismiss them if they are the only remaining tasks on the page, or do you do what I do and acknowledge that yes, I still want to do them, but I simply cannot at the moment?<br><br>Mark, I do hope you are well.  Take care.<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">David:<br><br>The answer to your specific query is that the situation you describe never arises for me because my list stays in one place - on my desk. When I'm away from my desk I am not working on the list (though I may be working on something which is on the list).<br><br>Nevertheless of course situations do arise when I am not able to do any of the tasks on a page for some reason or other. In which case I dismiss them. They will have been on the page for quite some time - I could have done them when I had the chance. I didn't - so out they go!<br><br>Note that by sticking to this rule, I am making it more likely that I will pick the items when I *am* able to do them - because I know that if I don't do them now they may get dismissed next time round.<br><br>If I were in Avrum's situation, I would consider having two lists, one for home and one for coffee shop, especially since there seems to be quite a clear divide between them. <br><br>If that weren't practical for some reason, then I would dismiss tasks according to the rules. Even in his circumstances the tasks will have been on the list for quite a number of days before they are in danger of being dismissed.<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>I can see your points, but I do have times in my position where I have my AF notebook at various places and can encounter tasks that can only be done at my desk in my office.  I may have a number of new tasks in this category, so they don't fit into the context of being on my lists for a long time.  So when in that situation, I go through my AF lists and encounter tasks that say out to me "yes, need and want to do this -- when I am back in my office this afternoon".  If those are the only remaining tasks on the page, why should I dismiss them?  I guess I don't understand your position on this.  IF the tasks were indeed on a page where they had been for some time, then maybe....but even then...I can't see dismissing tasks simply because I happen to be in a place at the moment where they can't be done.<br><br>Please elaborate some more on this.  Thanks!<br><br>Best wishes,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Too much over thinking here. If you can't do the items due to where you are physically, don't dismiss them. Wait till you are able to do them. If you decide when you get home you are not going to do them, then dismiss them. This seems to be obvious.<br><br>The only caveat is if you decide to live in the coffee shop to avoid going home to do the tasks.<br><br>It ain't that complicated.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Norman,<br><br>I agree - this is in line with my thoughts exactly!  You stated it more clearly.  Nothing like getting to the point.  But since I am a professor, I have to use much verbage to make my points.  Smiles....<br><br>Seriously, this is what I am trying to say -- if you cannot do the items due to where you are physically, then don't dismiss them.  Wait until you ARE at that location, and then if they don't stand out, dismiss them.  <br><br>Best wishes,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">David:<br><br>As I said in my earlier post developing your own criteria for dismissing is perfectly legitimate. What I said was that you need to be aware that your criteria for dismissing tasks will affect the way you tackle *all* your tasks. This is one of the factors you need to take into account.<br><br>It's difficult for me to elaborate further without knowing more of your precise working environment. I guess if you invited me (at vast expense!) to come and observe you working so that I could advise you on the best practice for your situation, the first thing I'd look at would be the reasons why you take your AF list with you when you leave your office. There may be very good reasons, but that would be where I would focus first.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>One example is that I travel many times to conferences.  I take my AF notebook with me and work on the plane sometimes and definitely in my hotel room at night.  If I encounter important tasks on a page and they again say "yes, do me as soon as you are back to your office", and they are the only ones on that particular page -- there may be many - I see no reason to dismiss them.  I just acknowledge that I cannot do them as I am not in my office and move on to another page.<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="meta">2009-05-12 19:23</div>
<div class="content">David:<br><br>My practice when attending conferences and such like is to have a separate notebook for  travelling. I would only put into it those tasks which I need as part of the travelling (e.g. finalise conference presentation, book table for dinner, confirm return flight reservation, check email, etc.), plus specific projects which I have decided I will work on during the conference - which means I will take the necessary documents with me.<br><br>During the conference any additional tasks get added to the list as they come up. If tasks come up which I can only do at home, I make a note of them in my notetaking notebook (i.e. not my travelling AF one) and transfer them to my Home AF book on return, plus any uncompleted ones from the travelling book.<br><br>I find this works far better than carrying my main AF notebook with me all the time - as I said earlier that never leaves my desk.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>This is really nice!  Of course I decide on what documents and projects that I am taking with me -- along with my main AF notebook.  But your approach has really intrigued me.  And not only that....it provides me the impetus to get another notebook!  I do love working on paper notebooks!<br><br>Thanks...and best wishes.  <br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">One thing that hasn't been mentioned is that dismissed tasks can be added back in, with some consideration. It seems to me entirely practical to dismiss an item which has been through a number of passes and did not stand out. Later on, if I decide I want to do it, nothing is stopping me from doing that, and, it gives you the satisfaction of completing a page....</div>

<div class="content">Avrum:  Also consider that you can put multiple lists in the same notebook.  Some people (as I was just reminded this morning in another post) add work tasks from the top down on a page and from the bottom up on the same page and draw a line when they meet ... thus having two lists interspersed in one.  Others, like me, work from the front of the book for one list and from the back forward for another (in my case I have multiple short lists working from the back).  I even read where someone turns his book upside down for alternate lists.  There is no end to the creativity ;-)</div>

<div class="meta">2009-05-13 10:46</div>
<div class="content">David:<br><br>One reason I would carry my list with me when I traveled would be that I would want to be able to write things in it when they occurred to me.  IOW, when I'm traveling for work I don't stop thinking about home, so I want to be able to keep ADDING to that list, even if nothing is being DONE on it just then.  My mind is ADD plagued so I'm always buzzing with ideas about things in one context while I'm in another.  Very perverse, but I have learned the futility of fighting it ;-)</div>

<div class="meta">2009-05-13 14:30</div>
<div class="content">Another possible take on this: when none of the remaining tasks can be done, you can just pick one and do some thinking or planning on it (even if it's only deciding when or where it can best be progressed). And according to the standard AF rules, this allows you to cross it off, re-enter it at the end and move on to the next page. Without dismissing anything ;)<br><br>Apart from that, Mark's comment that you most probably encountered the task several times when you had the possibility to work on it and didn't, and thus that it won't harm to dismiss it, seems quite sensible. Simply add it back at the next "Review dismissed items" action...</div>

<div class="content">Marc - intuitively, I started doing "thinking" on those tasks, and reentered it. Thus taking advantage of the AF approach to a lazy-ass like myself.</div>

<div class="content">I follow the dismissal rule strictly, as Mark recommends, because I don't like changing the psychology of the way the dismissal rules work.<br><br>And I agree with Mark, that usually you wouldn't even consider dismissing a page, till you've had many opportunities to take action on those items.  <br><br>That said, I do sometimes have the situation where something really does seem important, and I *wish* I could work on it, but don't have the tools handy, or am in the wrong place, or something like that.  <br><br>In those cases, I sometimes take some tiny insignificant action, and move the item forward.  <br><br>Let's say the item is on my home list, and it's "Call insurance company", but it's 10:00 PM and they are closed.  The item "stands out" but I just can't take action.  And I really can't dismiss this item, since it has too many ramifications.  So, there are lots of things I can do.  <br><br>I can rewrite the item "Call insurance company", and also note the phone number.  <br><br>I can pull out my insurance file, and look it over, and put it in my backpack to carry around with me as an extra reminder, and then cross off the task and add it again to the end.  <br><br>I can add the item to my office list as well, so maybe I'll see it during the day when I am more able to call them.<br><br>I can make a "to call" list, and then schedule a block of time on my calendar to make all those calls during the day that I tend to forget until it's already after hours.<br><br>I can think over the problem and ask myself why I have resisted calling them for so long, to the point that the task is facing dismissal.  And then rewrite the task with some special emphasis, e.g., "Call insurance company or you'll never get reimbursed for the $1200 they owe you!!"<br><br>I might also put the item on the calendar, or into my Outlook reminders, as an extra tickler.  <br><br>The idea is that the item really is "standing out", so it seems OK to me to take these kinds of actions and not dismiss the task.</div>

<div class="content">Personally, I had a lot of trouble with this issue, because I resisted keeping two lists (work and home), to the point that I felt that AF wasn't working for me.<br><br>The idea of keeping a single list is very tempting, but for me it was hard to manage. So I gave it a try, and my problems were solved. This is how it works for me:<br><br>* Both of them are always with me (I actually use a file that I can access from everywhere). The items on my "Work List" aren't necessarily work-related, there are LOTS of things that are personal, but I can do that when I'm working (paying a bill through the internet, et c).<br><br>* Many items appear on both lists, and this proved very efficient for me, especially when considering that my home list is rather neglected when compared to the other one.<br><br>* Sometimes I write in my work list "Review home list", and I when I reach that task, I give the whole home list a read, without performing anything, and without dismissing. It's just a read to verify that I'm not missing anything important. If that happens, I schedule a proper time to process my home list when I'm there.<br><br>* Since I started using two lists, I can dismiss without fear. In fact, I learned that "dismissing" is an amazing tool. Sometimes, when I reach that point, I actually feel relief, since the tasks I'm "freezing" were causing me guilt, and this way I can take a little distance from them and forget them for a while. But this is another topic anyway, just wanted to point it out.<br><br><br>I would suggest you to try keeping two or more lists. You can always go back if you want to anyway.<br><br>Walter<br><br></div>
