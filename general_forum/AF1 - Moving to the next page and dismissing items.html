<div class="content">Hi all!<br><br>I'm quite confused about when you're supposed to dismiss items from your list.<br>It seems to me, that you're supposed to dismiss all item on a page, if you don't work on any item from it. Or is it, that you have to dismiss only if this happens on the _first_ pass?<br><br>Thanks!</div>

<div class="content">Greg:<br><br>Rule 7 of the AF1 instructions covers this:<br><br>"If you go to a page and no item stands out for you on your first pass through it, then all the outstanding items on that page are dismissed without re-entering them. (N.B. This does not apply to the final page, on which you are still writing items). Use a highlighter to mark dismissed items."<br><br>This means the first pass on that particular visit. What it boils down to is that whenever you visit a page you have to do at least one task on it. Otherwise all the remaining tasks on the page get dismissed.</div>
