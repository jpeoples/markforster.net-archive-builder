<div class="content">I used AF for the first time at work yesterday. It was GREAT!<br><br>I've started my Home AF notebook, and came across a problem: Tasks that Cost me money.  (Everything I do at work MAKES me money, many things I do outside of work COSTS me money...)<br><br>Suppose some of the items on the active page look like this:<br><br>- Buy bricks for patio project<br>- Buy Socks<br>- Buy Bird Feeder<br>- Buy TurboTax software.<br><br>And suppose these are the only unfinished items on the page.  What if I don't have enough money set aside for the required purchases?  According to the system, I just go to the next active page. Fine. Now suppose I finish the last active page and return to this page with the BUY items on it.  I still don't have  enough money, so I can't DO any single item on this page.  So AF says to 'dismiss them all'.  Uh, I can't, they are ALL important, I just CAN'T get any done now.<br><br>I suppose I could just transfer them to the end of the list?  HEHE! I bet then soon my list will be filled with Cost items!  Does anyone have a better idea?  Perhaps I shouldn't even put a Cost item on the list until I know I have enough money for it?  Maybe set aside a separate 'Wish List' for items I want to purchase, and review that list regularly somehow?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Stephen<br><br>If you dismiss items you are not consigning to the great wheelie bin in the sky never to be seen again.  Dismissed items are items that you do not intend to do now, or consider important enough to do now.  If the Cost items are important enough to you then you will ensure you find the money somehow.  By dismissing them you can still review them regularly by means of a task to "review dismissed items".  at the appropriate time then just add them back into your lists.<br><br>Of course you could action them by means of adding to a shopping list which you reference regularly but if cash is the issue then you run the risk of creating a list of Cost items as you say.  The patio item could form part of a project management system (outside of AF) where the purchase of the bricks is merely a project task.  You would then put that task on the list at the time you decide is right for the project.  Again you can retain a prompt within the list by the addition of a simple task to "review patio project".<br><br>HOWEVER - if you only started AF yesterday, I assume using a notebook of around 30 pages, then you will probably have several pages of items you can add without too much difficulty.  Don't be afraid to add anything that comes to mind, without pre-qualifying it in any way.  As you work through your lists, continually adding to them, you will find that you visit each page numerous times before you get to the point of dismissing.  Remember you ONLY dismiss items on a page if NOTHING stands on on the FIRST pass of that page.  By the time you reach that point, you will have viewed each remaining item several times without action.  You may well find that some of those Cost items have been purchased by that time, or it will be an easy decision to dismiss the item as not sufficiently important to you at that point in time.<br><br>Hope that helps :-)</div>

<div class="content">Stephen,<br><br>the way I handle items that have to be done but also have to be dismissed because of lack of resources (time, money, staff) is to write them on the calendar on a date in the future in order to review them, whether they are feasible then or not. After making the entry in the calendar I dismiss the items from the AF list. So the buying or work gets delayed.<br><br>Meanwhile I work on projects/goals to get that needed resources, e.g. saving money, apply for funds,  planning time, ask people for help, etc,    to have that resources when the date fixed on the calendar has come.<br><br>If the resources, e.g. the money, can't be supplied,  I renegociate the issue with my boss at work or whoever wants the work to be done.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Easy Peasy:<br><br>Make your item " Work on patio"<br><br>If that is the last item on the page, move it to the end and let it cycle -- exempt it from the rule to dismiss it.  I.E. looking at it counts as working on it if it is the last item on the page.  You'll know what you have to do on the patio.  If you are waiting for money to buy bricks, you'll know that too.<br><br>OR ...You could rename it to various other things like "check bank balance" if that seems better.<br><br>OR ... You could simply take it out of autofocus until you are ready to buy your materials.  Personally, I don't put such things into autofocus.  If I have a project like that I know I'm working on it and I know what I have to do.  Any detailed info is in a project folder, not in my time management system.  Just FWIW.</div>

<div class="content">What I really like about AF is the fact that I can throw almost anything into it without much speculating, and while using the system , I find out if it is just a series of simple actions, that can be easily done, or a task with 10 to 20 actions that can be finished within one or two weeks, or if I indeed have a project, that has do be treated differently.<br></div>

<div class="content">How about reframing the statement from "Buy bricks for patio" to "Put $50 in the patio project account"?<br><br>Then, once the budget for bricks has been met, it is POSSIBLE to buy them. At that point, you can write "Buy bricks for patio."<br><br>Just an idea.</div>

<div class="content">Stephen:<br><br>What I do with any item that depends on circumstances that may or may not have happened when I come to the item is put it on the list with a question mark after it:<br><br>Work on patio?<br><br>Then if the answer is "No", I've answered the question!<br><br>I can then cross it out with a clear conscience and re-enter it at the end of the list.</div>

<div class="content">I love these suggestions and will use Mark's.  The reason AF works for me is I can trust it to hold every single thing I need to work on.  That why answering "no" then moving the item to the end of the list will really work.  I don't have to carry it around in my head but AF will automatically sort and prioritize these items for me.  I am still crazy about this system!</div>
