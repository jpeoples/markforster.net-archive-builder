<div class="content">Gee...I have been lampooned as Homer Simpson.  I only hope my graduate students and post-doc never see this.  Maybe I should quit asking "is it done, yet?"  Smiles....Homer Simpson....well....this is a first for me...<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Hi David and Andreas,<br>ROTFL ROTFL ROTFL  I didn't even know about the Homer thing.  I was recalling my family piled in the Bonneville station wagon going to visit our grandparents or going to our beach home!!  ROTFL!  (We had to draw straws over who got to sit in the 3rd back seat facing out.......yeah......we're were the annoying kids who made funny faces or faked a murder at the driver behind us!  *blush*<br>In the case of the Simpsons tape, David......I would guess that Mark actually would take on the role as Homer and we posters would be the kids!  LOL!<br>Thanks, Andreas!  That was a great chuckle!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">My Dad's reply was always: "It's just round the next corner".<br><br>Worked pretty well on my kids too!</div>

<div class="content">My wife is a teacher and often takes loads of kids on outings.  Of course they continually ask "how long till we get there?"  This starts before the bus starts the engine and continues until the door opens at the destination.  Her answer is always the same: "Twenty Minutes."  They seem to accept that ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Mike, that doesn't work with my 8 y.o. - "you said 20 minutes 10 minutes ago" is what I get back.  That kid is way too precocious - he didn't get that from me, of course...  :-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline,<br><br>Yep -- that never worked with my kids either.  They even reminded me of the exact time when I said "we will be there in 20 minutes".  In fact, I remember one trip where they reminded me at 20 minute intervals how much we were over my "be there in 20 minutes" statement.  Gee...maybe they take after their mother in that regard....could not be a reflection of my level of patience....smiles....<br><br>Best wishes,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">David, I am starting to think that now would be a good opportunity to teach him how to compute distance in kilometres and speed of travel to determine how long it will take to get somewhere.  Then he can start calculating *for* me instead of using his powers against me.  LOL</div>

<div class="content">One of my favorite family stories.  My mom was the navigator on our many trips each summer.  When I was an adult I rode with them in their RV and at the gas station my dad always asked how many more miles before ____?  She answered 75 miles, 50 miles, etc.  Finally I asked her how did she know how far it was off the top of her head.  She said, "I don't.  I just make up a number."  And it always satisfied my dad.</div>

<div class="content">Ah, you see, there is more to it than that.  Basically what the kids are doing is acting out.  They don't really want to know the time, they are just bored and want to poke the adult.  Where we go wrong is that we treat the question as if it were a question.  My wife tells them "20 minutes" as if that is the only possible answer ... and for her it is, because their question is not a real question so the answer should not be a real answer.  She will not engage them in their game.  So if they complain that she said that three times already she will just say: "Yes." nothing more.  If they ask how long now, the answer is the same "20 minutes".  The answer will ALWAYS be 20 minutes.  In fact, the older kids have finally learned and no longer ask and when the younger kids do, the entire bus will laugh and yell "20 MINUTES!". <br><br>I'm sure that if a kid really wanted to know they could think about it and guess how long it might take ... and maybe ask "Will it take three more hours to get there?"  I'll have to ask her, but I'll be she would treat that seriously and answer it seriously.  If a kid took the initiative to try to figure it out himself (such as noting where they were and where they were going and asked how many miles so they could compute the time) I'll bet she would tell them the millage.  She supports intelligence and ambition and work.  But kids need to learn that there is no free lunch.  She won't do their homework for them.  "20 Minutes" is the only answer there will ever be.  ;-)<br><br>She tends to treat the kids as if they had the maturity they SHOULD have, and challenge them to live up to it.  When a kid comes up and asks her (5 minutes before they have to hit the field for a competition) where his shoes are.  She looks down at her own feet and shrugs and says "I don't know.  MY shoes are on MY feet."  Really, the kid has to learn responsibility and never will if people solve his problems for him.  And, amazingly, in 5 minutes he will be on the field with his shoes (almost) on.  This is all acting out that she won't enable.<br><br>Once some kids left part of their uniform at school on the way to another school for a band competition.  (They were horsing around and did not take care of business.)  When they got there, they found they had no uniforms.  She did not get angry or bark at them or punish them.  She simply marched them to the band director of the school they were visiting and said: "These kids have something to ask you."  The kids were humiliated in having to beg for a loan of uniforms from the band they were competing against!  Did they learn their lesson?  Probably not.  But they started down that road.  They have one experience of what not taking care of business costs and they WILL learn, eventually.  They will learn much better (and, more to the point, in a better way) than if they were yelled at, or punished.<br><br>BTW, one side effect is that her kids respect her and she has no discipline problems.  And they work hard for her.  Last Thursday she held the final concert of the year.  She was conducting the band in a medley from "Chicago" when a small (tiny, really) fire broke out in an electrical outlet.  It caused the power to go out for about 10 seconds or so and the place went dark.  She kept on conducting and the kids kept on playing ... in PITCH DARK.  She was so psyched that they not only knew their parts well enough to keep playing in the dark when they could not see their music, but that they had the presence of mind and focus to not stop playing!  It was really wonderful ... and some of these kids are only in the seventh grade.  There is a kind of multiplier effect at work.  When the young kids start band with her, they are influenced by the older kids who know what is expected and have learned to live up to that.  Much of it is unspoken ... it is just a matter of the environment she has created.<br><br>So, until I get hard evidence otherwise, I have to assume that "20 minutes" really IS the best answer.  ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Mike, that's all about making the kids take ownership of things.  Something I don't think most parents do anymore.  Back in my parents day, they probably had to do this because they had 8 kids and couldn't micro-manage everything to do with us without going insane.  <br><br>That's one of the reasons I don't review my youngest son's agenda every day.  He has to learn that it's his responsibility to do what he has to do for school.  Most of my friends who have young kids even do their homework with / for them.  One friend who has done this for years (she wanted her kids to have high grades) even got her son in his first year of university to send her his essays to edit before he hands them in!  That's just wrong on so many levels.  Needless to say, he dropped out of University after his first year.  <br></div>

<div class="content">From the time I met my step daughter 6 years ago (she was 6) until today I give her a map at the start of the trip.  If she wants to know how far something is, she looks at the map.  Solved the problem from the beginning & it taught her how to read a map at an early age.  She would always tell us what the next town would be if she was too excited about going somewhere.  If she falls asleep & wakes up & wants to know how long until we get there, she just asks what city or town we're in & then she finds it on the map.  Makes life MUCH easier in the car!  :)  I've also taught her how to calculate miles from the mile marker.  So we tell her that we have approximately X miles to go, so what mile marker will that be?  Of course, this started when she was doing long math...not at 6 lol.  This also helped with time.  She knows that it takes us approximately 6 hours to get to a friend's house in north Atlanta, so she calculates what time we'll be there.<br><br>So, the only question we now get when we get in the car for short trips is, "where are we going?"  That one is a little more tricky b/c my husband likes it to be a surprise sometimes, which drives all of us crazy!  :)</div>
