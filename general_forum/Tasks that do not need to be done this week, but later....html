<div class="content">Hi Mark and All,<br><br>Okay -- here is another question relative to the task diary and new tasks.  Let's say that I realize that I need to prepare lecture materials for a 2-hour lecture that will take place two weeks from now.  Do I put this task on the default for tomorrow's list?  I do not need this done this week, so why should it go on tomorrow's list?  This gets back to my original question about assigning future tasks on days other than tomorrow.  Why would one not simply put this on the diary say two days before it is due?  There -- on the schedule and at a time when I can address it -- but not for tomorrow!<br><br>Just some thoughts...what does everyone think?<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Because:<br><br>1) If you start preparing the lecture now, your brain will start engaging with the material and you will end up with a better lecture. This is the effect known as "maturation",<br><br>2) If you leave preparing the lecture until a couple of days before, you will get all sorts of unexpected calls on your time in those two days (precisely what you have been complaining about in other posts) and will have to do the lecture preparation in a rush.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark,<br><br>Ouch!  Nothing like getting to the point.  Very good...I must admit sometimes I do not listen to myself as I rant on. Okay -- your advice is excellent as usual.  Thanks!<br><br>-David</div>
