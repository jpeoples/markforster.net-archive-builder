<div class="content">Hi there<br><br>In the AF2 instructions there was the recommendation to read through the whole list once a day. However, this recommendation is missing in the revised instructions. <br><br>Do you still recommend to do so or do you think it is not necessary any more?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Philipp, Mark has stated that he doesn't think it's necessary anymore in the revised version. So you don't need to read through the whole list in the morning.<br><br>References:<br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/2009/7/28/the-revised-autofocus-system.html#comment4940975" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/blog/2009/7/28/the-revised-autofocus-system.html#comment4940975</a><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/847798#post848677" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/847798#post848677</a><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Andreas<br><br>Thanks for the pointers. Sometimes I find it quite hard to follow the discussion (i.e. to find out which posts I have allready read).<br></div>

<div class="content">Philipp:<br><br>I've basically now left it up to the individual how often he or she reads through the tasks on the list.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Phillipp<br><br>It can be difficult to follow all the threads - if you keep a note of the time of the last post you read up to, then everything after that time will have new entries.  It takes a while to work out how best to keep up to date :-)</div>

<div class="content">I still start my day reading through the entire list. However on Monday, I'm starting an AM meditation habit. Reading my list will occur post-meditation.</div>
