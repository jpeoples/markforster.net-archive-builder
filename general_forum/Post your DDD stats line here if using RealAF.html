<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2017-07-27 2:16</div>
<div class="content">Just started Day 3 of Real AutoFocus.  I'm using a pocket notebook that has room for 26 tasks per page.  For the near future, I intend to log statistics each morning on one line in three columns, as follows:<br><br>Wed26Jul 2-4;4-3;5-4;6-1 8=4+2+2<br><br>Column decoder: <br><br>1. date<br><br>2. notebook page numbers and count of remaining tasks, for each active page (before DDD)<br><br>3. count of tasks 'above the line' that were deleted, deferred, and done<br><br>My page numbers will jump a bit since I'm interspersing non-task pages throughout the notebook.<br><br>Anyone else care to share their stats?</div>

<div class="content">erm, DDD stats meaning how many are deleted/deferred/done, not how many left.</div>

<div class="content">Ubi - I'm not sure I can do what you're doing. My pages are longer (37 lines) so I don't have multiple pages with open tasks. What is it you're curious about? Is it (1) the number of tasks added each day and (2) the number that require DDD when each new day starts?</div>

<div class="content">Zane,<br><br>When Mark tested this system (prior to revealing the details), he tracked the number of remaining tasks on consecutively numbered pages, and showed how they bunched up near the end of the list. He also mentioned that he was surprised at how few tasks remained for the DDD clearing step. I'm merely keeping track of where my remaining tasks land, and specifically how I'm dealing with the DDD step. I am curious about how well the DDD process will work for everyone that tries RealAF.<br><br>Alan's critique addresses the title of this thread - if that part is interesting to you, just consider Column 3. <br><br>No pressure!</div>

<div class="content">Ubi - I answered but don't see my post so here it is again.<br><br>I tried to add my stats earlier but got pulled away. I'll update on Monday.</div>

<div class="content">After one week, I'm surprised that the count of my DBY/DDD items has stayed in the single digits each day - very manageable. Also, this system seems to keep my list down to 2 or 3 small pages.  I like it!</div>

<div class="content">Weekdays (when I'm in office away from my homelist for 8 hours), I have ~25 lines used per day.  I have 10 items to clear out today.  Looking over them, I anticipate doing 5 and defering 5.  I have deleted things in past, none today though.<br><br>I have no stats for yesterday because I tore out the page and trashed it.  Nice clean feeling only having a couple pages to look at ever.</div>

<div class="content">I have been on vacation the last week and will be back home tonight & in the office tomorrow. The last day I was in the office was a hectic day and I never moved above the line. (Although I did glance above it briefly to find a few must-dos.)<br><br>I'm looking forward to seeing how easy or difficult it will be to pick up the messy list and carry on. I'll post some stats when I do.</div>

<div class="content">I stopped keeping track of these stats today & going forward.  I think this system is working very well for me, and am still surprised I don't end up having to defer much at all!</div>

<div class="content">I know this isn't how you were keeping stats Ubi, but here's how I'm going to track for a while.<br><br>At the beginning of the day:<br>above the line: 21 done, 16 to do<br>below the line: 3 done, 4 to do</div>
