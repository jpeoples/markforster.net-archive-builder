<div class="content">As I mentioned in David Drake's "Any testimonials . . ." thread, I started Random Access AF2 (RAAF2) today. <br><br>AF2 is constituted by its rules:<br>   1. Go to the last item on your list (i.e. the most recently entered task)<br>   2. Work backwards from the last item looking at each task in turn until a task “stands out”.<br>   3. Do the task in whole or in part.<br>   4. Re-enter the task if necessary.<br>   5. Repeat steps 1-5<br><br><br>RAAF2's rules are<br>   1. Look through your list however you feel like.<br>   2. Stop at a task that “stands out”.<br>   3. Do the task in whole or in part.<br>   4. Re-enter the task if necessary.<br>   5. Repeat steps 1-5<br><br>Note the this does not affect the start-of-day sequence which is sequential, not random.<br><br>My reaction thus far is very positive. It is not a huge difference, but it is significant. In AF2, I would do a quick item. Then I would go back to the end of the list and work towards the front. I would do another quick item. At this point, I didn't want to go back to the end again, since I just did that one minute ago. Furthermore, there was another item I wanted to do on my current page. But, dutifully and tediously, I would return to the last page and again work my way to the front.<br><br>In RAAF2, this problem is gone. If I want to do something else on the current page I do it. If I want to go to the front and work the block that's on notice for dismissal I do it. If I want to go to the last page and work on urgent recent stuff, I do it. <br><br>I am finding that I actually look at the items more carefully now. With AF2, after the 10th time, I was barely looking at the items near the end of the list, because I had been through them so many times already.<br><br>Of course, I don't have the kind of quality control standards that Mark has. I have only tested RAAF2 for 7.5 hours. Time will tell if this meme will replicate or become extinct.</div>

<div class="content">Hi moises<br><br>That sounds like an interesting approach - I am trying to work consistently but find that there is almost a game to play in trying to clear pages and blocks of items. I feel that I am even more familiar with my list than with AF1 and items that I know are in the lists just jump to mind - I then almost find myself then searching for them as I work back.  I find myself actually looking forward to the next dismissal block as the items now seem almost easy - weird!!!  I can't quite understand what they are still doing there - duh!</div>

<div class="content">Isn't this just "hopping around" ?   I did that back in March and posted about it here:<br><br><a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/683261" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/683261</a><br><br>I could probably get away with doing that today, but after only two months with the system, it wasn't a good idea.  It was definitely energizing though.  I got to avoid all the housecleaning I hate doing for awhile and got to start a whole bunch of projects that I didn't have time to finish!!  :-)<br><br>Your mileage will probably vary, moises. :-)<br><br></div>

<div class="content">You are simplifying the rules by making how you work it random.  But you seem to be doing something similar to what I am doing--at times I do jump to the newest item after I cross out any task, but at other times I just continue through the list for exactly the same reasons you give.  I think Mark even mentioned adding something to AF2 that would allow one to work either using standard AF2 rules or switching to AF1 rules when needed.  This would be similar to what you are suggesting.<br><br>I work from a list on my computer with my newest items at the top, so I am working down the screen, which is nice (nicer than working backward in my notebook.)  I also can easily hide completed tasks which keeps my list simpler and in front of me which helps somewhat with keeping it in my mind.  I almost wonder if Mark played with the AF2/AF1 hybrid primarily because there is a slight awkwardness to working backwards in a notebook (not to mention that it is sometimes disconcerting to look through items 1-15, seeing that 16 stands out, working on it for five minutes, and then going back and rereading 1-15) and so it might be nice at times to revert to AF1 and work item by item forward in the notebook.<br><br>In my on-screen list, I typically work standard AF2--but down the screen--and when I feel like it (the need stands out), I will then work item by item--still down the screen--, without going back to the beginning each time.  I do make sure I go back to the beginning anytime I add a new task, and whenever the desire to do so "stands out".<br><br>I am not sure this is much different than just doing AF2 by itself, since it is always possible to fly through those new items if you have just read them three times in the last 15 minutes.<br></div>

<div class="content">Hello moises,<br><br><br>i did this with AF1 and i am doing this with AF2 too. But i would not call it "random". <br><br>My active AF2 list is 4 pages long with 30 entries on each page. 30% of the items are not done yet. Because it is not that much, i know pretty well what is open and what has to be done today. So i do not have to go back to the end every time physicaly. I am doing it mentaly (not with any effort, more like driving a car).<br><br>The important part for me is the complete daily check of the list top down, so i get a mental picture of what has to be done today. I do go to the end of my list regulary, because i have to enter new items. That ist my time to scan the list backward. The rest of the time i allow my intuition to take control. Works very well for me.<br><br>Steffen<br></div>

It's a method that's been around for decades, possibly centuries, and is known as a "To Do List". If it works for you, fine. But I think I should point out what the disadvantages relative to AF2 are:<br><br>1) Far from being "a problem" the constant movement in AF2 from the back of the list is what makes the system so sensitive to changing circumstances throughout the day.<br><br>2) The dismissal process in AF2 sets up a tension which brings the whole list into focus. However this only works if you are moving from the back of the list as per the AF2 instructions.</div>

<div class="content">Chris:<br><br>As I understand it, what you are doing is standard AF2 but working from the beginning of the list forward. I tried this during the testing process, but what I found was that I was simply reading the same items over and over again and not taking them in at all. Working from the back of the list means that you are starting from a different place nearly every time (since tasks are constantly being added) and the tasks imprint themselves much more on one's mind.<br><br>Since you are working electronically, if you prefer working down the page rather than up it, why not simply re-arrange the items so the newest ones are at the top of the page?</div>

<div class="content">Mark, I do work the newest at the top of the list and then work down, which is AF2.  I am sorry if that was not clear.</div>

<div class="content">Strange days indeed when it's Mark himself who is posting "hey, that's just a to-do list" in this forum...!<br><br>I assume that what makes "RAAF2" not just a to-do list is that moises is still following the AF2 dismissal rules. It's not clear to me why the dismissal process would be weakened by randomly accessing the whole list instead of working from the bottom up. The bigger risk, it seems to me, would be that urgent tasks might get neglected.</div>

<div class="content">Hello moises,<br><br><br>today - after writing my post in this thread - i monitored how exactly i am using my list. How many times do i let my intuition take control and how many times do i follow Mark's rules. After 10 hours of work i am astonished: i followed Mark's rule every time. When ever i finished a task (15 today), i went back to the end of the list searched upward for a next task.<br><br>If you had asked me this evening without me monitoring myself, i would have told you that my intuition had driven me. So wrong. For me it is a sign that Mark's system does it right. It feels and is natural - at least for me. <br><br>Sorry for my clumsy words and my spelling. It is late, i am tired and writing in a foreign language gets harder every minute.<br><br>Good night,<br>Steffen<br></div>

<div class="content">After two days of RAAF2, I still enjoy it better than AF2. Of course two days is insufficient time to make any definitive judgments. <br><br>The key thing that differentiates this from a plain vanilla to-do list is that I make strenuous efforts to write everything down before I do it. <br><br>If I just started RAAF2 from scratch, it might have been a total failure. But it comes after months of DIT, months of AF1, and about a week of AF2. So I have a history and some habits of discipline from these other methods. <br><br>I'll continue to be a guinea pig and do this for as long as I can stand it. I will sacrifice my efficiency in the name of science.</div>

If you are working the list according to the rules, the dismissal process sets up a tension between the beginning and the end of the list which ensures that your intuition is able to prioritise the entire list correctly - urgent tasks and less urgent tasks. Random access doesn't have this affect (not for me anyway).</div>

<div class="content">Mark,<br><br>I am returning to the fold. I missed a semi-urgent task yesterday that was near the end of my list. Even though I went to the end of my list and worked backwards a few times, I still missed it. Maybe if I went to the end and worked backwards _every_ time, like AF2's rules dictate, I would not have missed it.<br><br>Thanks.</div>
