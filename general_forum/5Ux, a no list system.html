<div class="content">After reading all of Mark's high praises for "no list" or "very short list" systems I decided to give it a try.  Of course I couldn't help but challenge myself to make up a system from scratch instead of using one that is already offered here, and besides I am intrigued by all of the promises that Mark's secret system offers:<br><br>> No or at least minimal re-entering of tasks.<br>> Short and simple to work.<br>> Tackles urgent stuff. <br>> All unfinished tasks get worked on multiple times during the day.<br>> Monitors how much you have succeeded in doing during a day.<br><br>So I made a "no list" system that seems (theoretically) to have all requirements, and I started to use it today to see how it goes.<br><br>The system is a list of five tasks plus a reserved slot for any urgent task that comes. Therefore, you can have theoretically up to six tasks at a time, but that is not the "natural" state of the system; ideally, it should only have five.  Also, once you have six items already on the list and another urgent matter comes, if you want to tackle that new urgent matter using the system, you have to cross out one of the tasks in the list and write the new urgent task down so that the total never goes above six items.  This rule is where the "5U" part of the name comes from.  <br><br>The "x" is where the selection of tasks comes in.  You can handle the tasks in the list in whatever order you want.  If you want to tackle a task, you write a slash mark, /, to the right of the task.  If you are done with it for now but the task is not finished for the day, write a counterslash, \, over the slash, making an X.  This is to minimize rewriting and also acts as a counter of how many times you've worked on an item.  Of course, once you are done with an item for the day, you cross it out.<br><br>I have not decided on any rule on how to replenish the tasks in the list, but I am leaning towards replenishing the list anytime you want.  <br><br>You also discard everything by the end of the day and start from scratch every morning.<br><br>If anybody wants to use this system, feel free to do so.  Of course, if you are more comfortable with using less than or more than five items at a time, feel free to try using 4Ux, 3Ux, 6Ux, etc.  Of course, the "very short list" is supposed to be "very short", and yet on the other hand it is still supposed to be a "list", so please don't go overboard either way ;-)</div>

<div class="content">Sounds a lot like spinning plates but with only enough plates to set the table. Also new plates every day. I think it would be interesting to roll a die to choose an item (unless you have an urgent item) in order to remove resistance. I think it is interesting to have an urgent slot because I have done something like this but as a "1Ux" system in effect. Write down one goal on the left column, and in the right column write down anything you do that isn't that one thing. Come back to the one thing as often as you can. I will give 5Ux a shot.</div>

<div class="content">nuntym:<br><<I have not decided on any rule on how to replenish the tasks in the list, but I am leaning towards replenishing the list anytime you want.  >><br><br>this means you don't work on the list till ONE task is left and THEN replenish? So, in practise, if you had done 2 of 5 Task you allow yourself to add 1 or 2 Tasks at any time?</div>
