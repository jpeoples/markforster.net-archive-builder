<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2011-01-18 19:43</div>
<div class="content">I'm contemplating combining DIT with DWM at work (wasn't DWM in it's earliest days called 'DIT2'?). IMHO there are some strengths in DIT that have been lost in all AFs, including DWM. <br>(1) For one, the idea to at least 'touch' all your tasks within one day (n.b. that this is not exactly the instruction 'by the book', which tells you to finish all of your list). <br>(2) Second, a place for your must-do-today tasks. I never found a good place for those short-deadlined tasks (within half an hour, one hour, ...), that I have a *lot* of, in AF (note that I never tried SAF/SF, which might have solved that, but looked a bit convoluted to me, and requires more paper estate than I usually have; it also doesn't translate easily into digital). <br>Both (1) and (2) are very important for my work. I never was very good at that 'standing out' thing, hence AF never worked very well for me.<br><br>On the other hand, DIT has some weaknesses, which DWM could help overcome. <br>When I was doing 'orthodox' DIT, I hardly ever finished my 'will do' list. I also had problems deciding what exactly was a 'will do', i.e. a real committment, and tended to throw everything at it, being afraid that something might get lost. DIT has problems with over-committing oneself (obviously, this was intended), tasks left undone at the end of the day (which build up a backlog) and tasks started, but not finished (esp. tasks that take longer than one day in the first place). Once you built up a backlog (in the non-DIT-technical sense), there isn't a good procedure to get rid of it, and all those undone tasks are kind of depressing. In addition, DIT isn't very good at keeping your projects on track.<br><br>Enter DWM's time-based dismissal. To me that looks like a perfect way to deal with the inevitable  backlog from DIT and keeping your projects running. <br>Everything left over from today's DIT list is moved to DWM, and 'work DWM' is added to DIT's daily tasks. Undone tasks are added at DWM's one month/4 weeks point, unfinished ones at the one week point. You lose the perfect input-output meter that DIT provides, but DWM should be able to do sufficient load balancing.<br><br>So the general idea is to throw everything (*) at DIT, entering every new task on tomorrow's list (except if it's a must-do-today), to at least touch all items on today's 'will do' list, even if moving them over to DWM is all I do with some of them. <br>DWM takes care of weeding out whimsy ideas and stuff that doesn't really need to be done. DWM also collects all dismissed tasks in case I want to review them later.<br>(* For some non-important, non-urgent task, I might skip the DIT part and go straight to DWM.)<br><br>The tricky part seems to be dealing with two systems and a lot of rewriting, and deciding where to add leftover tasks from DIT in DWM. <br><br>Any comments? <br><br>Regards, <br>Alex</div>

<div class="content">Come to think of it (the post above was already written when the idea of a "DIT+DWM.xls" crossed my mind), both could even be combined in one diary or Excel file: Think of DWM with entry points of 0 days (= today, only for tasks that absolutely *must* be done the same day), 1 day (= tomorrow, default), 7 days (re-entries), 4 weeks/1 month (stuff that you don't want to commit to atm, or that is being pushed back to near 'someday/maybe' status). Work today's tasks first, then turn to the other days. Make sure nothing gets dismissed that you don't want to. <br>However, a unified system could potentially dilute the power of the dismissal feature of the system (if you get into a habit of pushing everything back to the 4w/1m point to clear today's list, instead of letting useless tasks get dismissed). <br>In my case there's also the problem for a digital application that "tomorrow" may only be a work day (Mon-Fri), so that nothing gets dismissed on a weekend. <br><br>The idea of a *real* 'DIT2' (personally, I consider DWM1 being closer to AF than to DIT) is very appealing to me as it would suit the nature of my work very well, where many of my task don't allow for response times much longer than 1 day.<br><br>Regards, <br>Alex</div>

<div class="content">@ leon: <br><br>Yes, AF2 may give the shortest response times. But that's about all it does. <br>I maybe tried it for a day or two, didn't like it. <br>It gives me the same kind of problems as "prioritizing by urgency" does: Not *all* of my tasks are that urgent. The non-urgent background tasks/long-term projects shouldn't be lost, and there should be a good system in place to keep projects on track. <br><br>@ Matt: <br><br>Thanks for the suggestion, but I don't think this system is too complicated in practice (and it's *completely* different from AF1 with Flagged Tasks, IMHO): <br><br>- Enter new task under tomorrow's date (or, if it's clearly a 'someday/maybe' item, directly under the +1m/+4w date). <br><br>- If it's a 'must-do-today' (*) item, do it immediately (e.g. if it takes 5 minutes or less) or add it to today's list.<br><br>- Work through today's list until it's completely empty, or only contains items that can be dismissed. <br><br>So far, that's pretty canonical DIT. <br><br>- Re-enter unfinished tasks under the +7d date (you have to re-enter them _somewhere_ after all).<br><br>- If there are still some undone items left on today's otherwise empty list that you don't want to work on today which are not time-critical, and you don't want them to be dismissed, re-enter them on the +1m/+4w date. If you're lucky, there aren't any.<br><br>- You may re-enter time-critical items either on the +1d or +7d point, whichever suits you better. +1 will typically suit the all-important project you want to resume the very next day. <br><br>- Once today's list is empty or all remaining items can be dismissed, work your way through the other pages of the list as long as you feel like. Most likely, you will meet your most urgent tasks/ongoing projects again on the +1 to +7 pages.<br><br>- If any 'must-do-today' (*) tasks arrive after you emptied today's list, you may as well do them immediately, as the most pressing and/or important tasks are dealt with anyway.<br><br>- One exception: Tasks with 'hard' due dates are entered on the day that gives you enough buffer to get them finished in time. <br><br>What's so complicated about that? <br>I'd much rather not have to do a morning planning session to extract a daily to-do list (which is basically what you do by 'flagging', only that you don't have a good place for new 'must-do-today' tasks, unlike DIT). Neither do I need additional pages for recurring or unfinished tasks, there are no additional columns for urgent items, no forward/backward modes, no markups etc. And I have a calendar-based (!) system (without any task outsourced into yet another calendar) with time-based dismissal, something I feel much more comfortable with than 'standing out' or 'dismissal by intuition'. Plus, I get rid of the dreaded DIT backlog.<br><br>Please note that I intend this to be a pure work system in a typical office setting.  So no 'fun' tasks (nor any 'take the trash out' type of stuff), and most likely almost all of the tasks *have* to be done some day. <br>If you don't have too much to do (i.e. you do at least *some* work an all the new tasks you entered the day before), and almost no nearly-useless tasks (so no need to enter anything at the +4w/+1m point in the first place), you probably won't even have more than 7 pages that way - of which 2 are empty weekend pages.<br><br>Sounds pretty simple to me. <br><br>Regards, <br>Alex<br><br>(*) Maybe there is some misunderstanding here about my 'must-do-today' tasks which arrive *in the course of a day*. Quite a while ago, I wrote a long post about it here:  <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/626809" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/626809</a> . I haven't found 'prioritizing by urgency' a really good solution for that. Basically, I need a special place (in the front of my face) for those very short-term deadlines. DIT has it. AF (with or without flagged tasks) doesn't.</div>

<div class="content">Sorry, I mixed up two paragraphs of the list, that part of the post should read: <br><br>- Re-enter unfinished tasks under the +7d date (you have to re-enter them _somewhere_ after all).<br><br>- You may re-enter time-critical items either on the +1d or +7d point, whichever suits you better. +1 will typically suit the all-important project you want to resume the very next day. <br><br>- If there are still some undone items left on today's otherwise empty list that you don't want to work on today which are not time-critical, and you don't want them to be dismissed, re-enter them on the +1m/+4w date.

<div class="content">This is exactly what I've been doing since this week.<br><br>After trying out all the AF-versions including DWM, SAF and AF4R over the past two years, I turned back to AF1 a couple of months ago. I really missed the timed dismissal of DWM, so I changed to DWM, which I've managed to keep up with for over a month, which is quite long for me.<br><br>The only gripe I have about DWM is that I don't have a good overview of all the tasks that I want to do today, they tend to be spread out over 30 pages. So now I'm using DIT, and any undone tasks are processed DWM-style.<br><br>What I do is use a regular notebook, and enter today's date on top of the page with "tomorrow's" tasks (i.e., the stuff that I wrote down yesterday), followed by an arrow and the DWM-dismissal date (a month from now). I put "process DWM-pages" on today's list also. Below the line I rewrite worked on but not completed tasks, and if there are any left at the end of the day I rewrite them at the 7-day page. This limits rewriting, and keeps the recently touched tasks close by. Effectively, every page has 2 dates, the date that I originally worked on the page in DIT-style, and the DWM-dismissal date. Any new tasks that I don't want to do today are entered on the next blank page, which gets dated tomorrow.<br><br>So far (after 3 days) it works really well. DIT stimulates me to quickly finish new tasks, and it forces me to keep my workload limited so I can at least do *some* meaningful work on all tasks on the list. I really like the concept in the original DIT of having a clear view of the amount of work that is actually on my plate, because I tend to take on too much.</div>

<div class="content">Nicole,<br><br>Since you were fond of AF1 and only missed the timed dismissal, why didn't you just limit your active AF1 pages to X number of pages? When you get to X+1 pages, you must go through the dismissal process.<br><br>Or, why didn't you just place the current  date in the notebook everyday and then when X days have passed, you must go through the dismissal process of all tasks prior to Today-X days ago?<br><br>And, you mentioned limiting rewriting - have you tried flagging tasks with removable, see-through "arrow" flags and using these flagged tasks as your closed list?<br><br>Matt</div>

<div class="content">Nicole, <br><br>I think that you could save yourself quite a bit of hassle by using a real dated diary. Given we are about half-way into January, you might be able to find a few substantially discounted ones. A real task diary would save you some double bookkeeping of dates. <br><br>It's my impression that there's a big advantage to see the task diary as a real calendar, and the DWM expiry dates as 'artificial due dates' (which basically they are, and that's also why I want to keep tasks with 'hard' deadlines before their real due dates). Letting any tasks roll past today's date was what always gave me a bad conscience with DIT (the much-dreaded 'backlog'), and visually keeping them in the future à la DWM was a big relief.<br><br>Yes, DWM *did* suffer from tasks spread over too many pages (DWM2 tried to repair that, but in turn it too much resembled a single open list IMO). But note that if you always do at least *'something* on all the tasks on your 'today' list, there will never be any tasks beyond the seventh page.<br><br>Regards, <br>Alex</div>

<div class="meta">2011-01-20 9:12</div>
<div class="content">Yes, I've considered a 'real' task diary, they're indeed substantially discounted now. But I tend to have several days a week that I'm not working my list because of lots of scheduled commitments, and that leaves a lot of empty pages (at least 1-2 a week). If/when I find a nice-looking day-a-page diary for a nice price I'll probably buy it, but the way I'm working now it's not really necessary.<br><br>About flagging tasks: even when flagged they're still spread out over a lot of pages. The nice thing about DIT is that everything is on one page. And another nice thing about DIT that's missing from DWM or AFx is that when I decide I'm not doing something today, I'll write it on tomorrow's page and then it's out of sight until tomorrow. Keeps the clutter limited.<br><br>BTW: the double-bookkeeping with dates sounds more complicated than it actually is. For example, this morning I wrote 20-jan-2011 > dismiss 20-feb-2011. That's all there is to it.<br><br>Oh, and thanks for the suggestion about limiting the number of AF1-pages. That sounds very logical, but for some reason it never occurred to me...</div>

<div class="content">I'm late DIT user. For me, it works more effectively than the newer systems in organizing my days. But I also miss DWM, and its disimissing methods.<br><br>I've been reading about your methods with interest.<br><br>I wish there could be a more automatic way to put things on tomorrow's list, or in one month, instead of having to decide, and a more strict way to jump from tomorrow's list to the global (after one pass without doing anything, or something like that).</div>

<div class="meta">2011-01-20 16:01</div>
<div class="content">How about this? It works like DWM2:<br><br>1. You start entering tasks with tomorrows date.<br>2. Tomorrow, you close the list with a line. This last closed list is what you are going to do today.<br>3. New tasks go after the line. You’ll work on these tomorrow.<br>4. Next morning, you draw a new line. Tomorrow tasks go after it.<br>5. Today, you’re working in what’s before this last line, and after the previous one, looping over and over.<br>6. Tasks that were left undone in the day before are automatically part of the backlog.<br>7. One pass in today’s list without doing anything, will bring you to the beginning of the list.<br>8. If all the tasks of today’s list are finished, you go back to the beginning of the list.<br>9. Dismissal works as in DWM2.<br><br>It’s almost DWM2, but working on the last list before everything, and adding new tasks to tomorrow’s list.<br><br>Well, it's not very different than your method, Alex.</div>

<div class="content">Matt, <br><br>>> you don't have a good place for new 'must-do-today' tasks, unlike DIT<br>> All 'must-do-today' tasks are flagged, so I'm not sure to what you are referring.<br><br>Obviously, you missed the word NEW before 'must-do-today tasks'. Those task don't exist yet at the beginning of the day (when you do your flagging, i.e. extract your daily to-do list). Unfortunately, I forgot the correct term in DIT parlance and am unable to look it up ATM, but that's what goes 'below the line' in DIT. The line is drawn at the beginning of your day. The tasks above the line (that you entered the day before) and the task that arrive in the course of the day but you absolutely *must* do the same day (those below the line) are your day's 'will do' list.<br>It's my strong impression that you haven't read DIT, and that's why you don't know what I'm referring to.<br><br>As for your other proposed system: Thanks, but that's really way off for the way my work works.

<div class="content">Small (?) update: I have been using this system for a few days now, and as of yet, it's been working quite well. <br><br>I had a bit of a rough start, since I lost some days due to illness. I had also dumped quite a bit of older, but now-urgent tasks into the system in the first place (I did isolate a substantial backlog, but didn't dare to put everything in there because I knew that I would be rather slow at reducing it; so I had to do some pre-sorting of the backlog). <br><br>So far, I managed to stick to both the Current Initiative (working the backlog first thing in the morning, at least to some extent) and 'Inbox Zero' (which I never managed to do in the past for both email and paper at the same time). <br><br>It's obvious that you lose some of the procrastination-busting power of the AFs, but OTOH, "little and often" doesn't work too well with much of my work anyway. One funny thing I noticed is that I started to use clearing both the paper and electronic inbox as a means of structured procrastination.<br><br>I forgot to mention that I added both 'Inbox Zero' and some core concept of GTD (like the general workflow, minus the project list and all other stupid lists) to my system.<br><br>Tomorrow will be especially interesting, as it will be the first time my system hits the busiest day of the week, filled almost completely with same-day tasks, and there's one colleague missing (out of four), whose work I will have to do as well. <br><br>I need some more fine-tuning of the (re)entry points, as I still stick to rewriting most of the unfinished/undone stuff from today to tomorrow's list too much, and almost all new entries go to tomorrow's list (as opposed to the 1m/4w point). There's pretty much DIT (plus rewriting, but absolutely no open taks are allowed on earlier dates than today), and not so much DWM in this system yet.<br><br>But the list keeps getting shorter every day (even though I keep adding new tasks from the backlog), which is very nice :-) <br><br>Also, the ratio between finished and postponed tasks keeps improving. <br><br>I have dismissed only one task up to now (which wasn't really a work task in the first place). Which was to be expected, as almost all tasks are non-dismissible (as in: I have no choice).<br><br>BTW: I use a pretty standard A5 day-to-a-page book calendar, and I use the left and right columns (that are pre-printed) as above/below the line. I would have preferred a nearly-blank dated diary, but couldn't find one (except for the expensive Moleskines).<br><br>Regards, <br>Alex</div>

<div class="content">Walter, <br><br>I can't see where there's a place in your system for same-day tasks (I finally managed to find my copy of DIT, and look up the correct term, hooray!) on the very same page that you work from most of the time. That's an absolute key point in both DIT and my system, and very important for my work. It's also something that's not present in DWM (or DWM2 or any of the AFs except SAF/SF). <br><br>It's interesting, that Mark didn't seem to value it higly for quite a while (probably due to his own situation) but it seems to have a strong resurgence with SAF/SF/SF2/SF3. <br><br>Plus, I need dated pages reaching much further into the future than tomorrow (or even one month, actually) to keep the list of my tasks synchronized with the general cyclical nature of my work, and to manage 'hard' and preliminary (*) deadlines. I generally don't like to use an additional calendar for that, always found that disruptive. <br><br>(*) BTW, I was always wondering and couldn't find some good reference for this: Is there an English word for a first ('pre-')deadline that you set as the latest starting point to still have enough time to work on something to meet the 'real' deadline? (In German, there's the word "Vorfrist", with "Frist" meaning "deadline".)  'Preliminary' or 'interim deadline' doesn't really seem to be what I'm looking for. In Outlook there's a 'start date' which accomplishes something like that, yet it's still slightly different.<br><br>Regards, <br>Alex</div>

<div class="content">Matt, <br><br>thanks, 'first notice date' sounds good. <br><br>Re Post-it notes: Back when I tried AF (1), I had a special place on every page reserved for Post-it notes, that were supposed to be moved on the very page I work on. Didn't work at all. It felt like a clumsy workaround all the time, not integrated into the system. IIRC, others reported similar results with add-on stickies or additonal index cards. My own results with AF4 weren't great, either, when I tried it with an additional index card.<br><br>IMHO, nothing beats the general idea of DIT when it comes to keeping all the work you have on your plate *now* on one single page. <br><br>Overall, all of the AFs (save for SAF/SF, which I never really tried, but including DWM/2) were failures for me. One of the reasons is that their undated nature simply is unsuitable for my work. Second, 'little and often' isn't a good fit there, either. The third major reason is that none of the AFs has a very good way to get rid of your backlog.<br><br>BTW: Just finished some statistics. I started my current system with a finished (or at least 'worked on') tasks : 'merely postponed' tasks ratio of 7 : 14. Now, I'm at a ratio of 14 (which are almost all 'finished', not only 'worked on') : 12. After a while, I hope to achieve a ratio of 10 : 1 (once the additional backlog items I keep feeding in are done or dismissed). Please note that (1) my work contains a substantial number of 'off-the-list' tasks, which I cannot avoid due to the nature of my job and (2) my numbers are a bit smaller than, say Mark's because the tasks are in larger chunks (not, of course, compared to 'War and Peace', *lol*). Once I reach something like that 10 : 1 ratio (which is quite realistic in about two months time), there will be hardly any rewriting anymore.</div>
