<div class="content">By this question I mean why not have a list system that dismisses everything from the day before? This can easily be done by drawing a horizontal line at the end of yesterday's list and and then a diagonal line across the page/s before that horizontal line.<br><br>Theoretically, this retains the advantage of the "Catch All" list which is completeness (since the written items are not crossed out you can still read the dismissed items clearly) as well as generating greater focus since you are just focusing on today with occasionally getting ideas and tasks from the dismissed items.  Aside from that, you can also use an algorithm such as FVP to create even more focus.<br><br>Thoughts?</div>

<div class="content">Hi Nuntym,<br><br>That's interesting - I do pretty much that every day. I draw a line each morning, date it and start listing what's on my mind that day. I dot the first task under the date line and start working FVP from there. I go back to the previous list only if I feel like it or if the FVP algorithm takes me there. I have no idea if it makes me more productive, but it does feel as if I am addressing what is on my mind.<br><br>Its a sort of compromise between the catch-all FVP and the focus of 5T. I want to make 5T work but I struggle with it. 5T feels good when I can stick to it for a day.<br><br>Matt</div>

<div class="content">I've experimented with one day dismissal a lot. In fact the system I'm using at the moment, which is proving incredibly effective, is a one day dismissal system.<br><br>My tip would be to forget the bit about being catch-all as well. I feed each day's sheet through the shredder as soon as the day is over. The effect on one's brain is quite remarkable.</div>

<div class="content">Nice ideas. I'm going to try out (I wish I could stick with a system for more than a few days) this: <br><br>Before going to bed, dismiss the day before as described by Nunym. Then, write current date. Then, write 5 (or similar low number) things that are on my mind to work on tomorrow. Next, draw a line underneath, about 2/3 across. Go to bed / finish for the day. Optional: dot the item one wants to work on first the next day. <br><br>New items and the 5 items that have been worked on but are unfinished can be re written below the line. The line is there to indicate that the items above it have been planned out and deemed as significant to do. <br><br>There is no other algorithm or dismissal to look out for. Simply dot the next item that is relevant to work on at the time I.e. The selected item could be from above the line or below it. <br><br>Finally, dismiss the page(s) at the end of the day and repeat the process.</div>
