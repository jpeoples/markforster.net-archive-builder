<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content">SF3 works well, and doesn't require this formality, but I think it's a valuable addition.  (Other approaches are possible too.)<br><br>There are things that need to be done today, but don't need to be done now.  I don't mean things you merely "want" done. I don't mean to make plans (as in DIT) of things you hope to do.  I don't mean making a list like the "Will I Do this today?" technique.  Things I hope (but don't need) to have done today just go in SF.  I'll get around to them when I get there.<br><br>In short, whatever appointments are for today, whatever daily routines exist, whatever weekly routines are scheduled for the day, and whatever you are expected to have done today:<br><br>Write these on a page.  There should be few items.  Whenever I flip an SF page, I glance at these.  I may just do one (immediate) or add any to SF column 2 (soon).<br><br>Why: Because these aren't urgent, may not be what I want or ought to do first thing, but they shouldn't be forgotten.  I could write them directly in SF, and normally I'd come upon them.  But if something comes up which will cut my day short, I know the things I *need* to cover and can take care of them.</div>

<div class="content">At the same time I like this and it scares me. ;) One more cog. <br><br>I'm thinking that for me a good use of it would be to write them on the post-it that I keep on my current page. Right now I have a cute, designed post it. But I could see using a more utilitarian post it and having it hold the Today items. And that would be nice because it wouldn't have to be used all the time, just when you have some items that you know you need to do 'later today' and your schedule would lend itself to it. Example: You don't want to put it in C1 because you're not near that page and don't know if you'd make it, and you don't want to put it in C2 because you can't/won't/don't need to do it THAT soon, but later today sometime. Hmmm.</div>

<div class="content">Sorry, I've mistaken you for someone else then.  You wrote "Whenever I flip an SF page, I glance at these." If you flip pages regularly and often enough during the day, and use the list from wake-up time till bed time, then I understand you don't have to set reminders.</div>

<div class="content">Alan, <br><br>That's a good point; I think to a great extent the Calendar is a virtual COL3 for SFv3. Such that;<br><br>COL1 is:<br><br>(a) the currently active subset of your Backlog that you have available to select as NEW in progress work.<br><br>COL2 is:<br><br>(a) The current in progress work list<br>(b) Urgent inbound queue that must be in progress based on the way it arrived in your world.<br>(c) The space remaining in COL2 is your count down timer telling you an estimate of how long you have before you must close the window of opportunity to act on items COL1.<br>(d) The list of items you must action to some degree before you can review any other section of you backlog; or process future action on previously acted on items from this page.<br><br>COL3 is:<br><br>(a) Represented by your Calendar and Ticker in a virtual sense<br>(b) Must be considered when selecting any COL1 or COL2 items to action next.<br>(c) Can be ignored while one moves forward a page<br>(d) Must be actioned by the end of the day -or- re-negoitated<br><br><br>In my personal world COL2 item (c) is the major motivator to whittle down COL1 and it's very effective.  COL3 is essentially a throttle that prevents me from activating too many COL2 items when it's not appropriate.  I hadn't noticed that second dimension until you poised you point.</div>

<div class="content">No, I don't have a good memory for what I must do..  To reiterate what I said at top, I have a note with a list of things that need doing today.  This doesn't require constant consulting, regular flipping, or a good memory.  I just look at the page.</div>

<div class="content">@Alan : Well, good for you... I know that just relying upon 'looking at the today list' could lead me to miss certain things that need to or can only be done today within a limited time slot. This because of my (selectively) bad short-term memory, and the fact that i wont look at the list often enough during the day. So, even though I'm gonna use something similar to your idea, I will still need reminders.<br><br>@Bob : your post is spot-on... SF3 isnt a complete time management system by itself (and Mark has never pretended it was), it still needs to be at least used conjunctly with a calendar/reminders system. There are many ways to do this, Mark has already shared some ideas with us and this thread is an example of other different, clever ways to do it. I hope Mark will give us more of his own ideas about this in his SF tips series or in the SF ebook itself.</div>

<div class="content">There's no doubt, you need some sort of "Today List" to use with SuperFocus. The lucky ones can keep it in their head, but the rest of us have to invent some nerdy process involving Post-Its or little reminder pages. I have stuck with my daily "booklet" (one page folded in half) for maybe a month now.<br><br>There is a "transform" issue though, pr perhaps a "window size" issue. Take exercise, for example. I follow a couple of simple interlocking routines—one for strength and another for cardio, except I skip cardio about once a week when it hits a really busy day. Put that together, and allow for a regular progression of things like sets & reps, and the composite cycle looks erratic. Assembling that day by day means revisiting the same logic every night, when I could just map out the whole week on a single card or Post-It every Sunday.<br><br>(a nice example is here, from Tijl Kindt: <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1432439" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1432439</a> )<br><br>But then instead of a daily booklet, I will have a weekly gaggle of Post-Its (one for exercise, one for errands, one for driving the kids all over town, etc.), which sounds less appealing.<br><br>Fortunately, I am getting faster at making this page, and the effort is still worthwhile for my purposes.</div>

<div class="content">One word: gym, is on my daily routines list. One page has a grid of what I did each visit. These are like checklists but columns for each day; like that printed postit I saw but full page instead.</div>

<div class="content">Like Alan, I need a visual reminder of a few items I want to get done today.<br><br>I really appreciated Bob's description of the calendar as a virtual C3!<br><br>Both of these ideas are why I have my SF book set up the way I do. I have it in an 81/2 x 5 1/2 size looseleaf binder. When I open the notebook, the left-hand page has my schedule for the day (printed in advance from my computer) with room to write notes, or a "today list" or a shopping list, or whatever. On the right-hand page I have my SF list (current page on top; when I "turn to the next page" I put the top page at the back of the section.) This is working beautifully for me. <br><br>I posted pictures on the Flickr site. I enjoy seeing the pictures of people's various setups!</div>

<div class="content">Does anybody besides me just enter these things directly into Column 2?<br><br>If you are NOT using Column 2, why not?  Is it because it causes Column 2 to fill up too quickly?   Or is it just a chore to enter those tasks every day?<br><br>I have four recurring Morning items, one recurring Noon item, and one recurring Evening item.  <br><br>It doesn't make sense to do the Noon item before Noon, so it doesn't get entered till then.<br><br>Likewise, it doesn't make sense to do the Evening item before ~5 PM, so it doesn't get entered till then.<br><br>I use Outlook to remind me to enter them into Column 2.   Sometimes I do the task immediately when the reminder pops up.  But that's usually inconvenient, so I jot the task down in Column 2 as soon as I get a chance.   Most of the tasks are abbreviated (such as "Mg" for "magnesium + vitamins") so it takes less than 1 second to enter the task.<br><br>Instead of Outlook, I tried using alarms on my cell phone but it was too annoying.  [Anyone know a good alarm app for Android 1.5 that STOPS BEEPING after about 2 seconds, and has a persistent notification in the notification bar until you dismiss it???  :-) ]   I'd prefer the cell phone approach since I am not always at my PC with Outlook open -- but I do always have my cell phone handy.<br><br>I also tried having a Sticky with these items listed and entering them into SF at the appropriate time into SF.  But I really need something to jar me at the right time and remind me.  Otherwise I will forget.</div>

<div class="content">If you use outlook to remind you of these things, that IS your equivalent of my today list, except there's also untimed stuff. I don't want to dump it all in C2 because that would imply doing it soon.  When the time to do it Approaches, then I'll dump it in C2.</div>

<div class="meta">2011-03-17 3:21</div>
<div class="content">I don't like to put these things in C2, because it does fill up C2 too fast. Also, if it's not time to do it yet, putting it there would get me stuck on that page.<br><br>Having a calendar page works well for this stuff, because I can put things on it days in advance. For instance, if I have something due on Friday, I'm pretty sure I'll be working on it Thursday. I can put the reminder on Thursday's page. When Thursday comes, I'll see the reminder, and at that point, I can put it in SF, in whatever column seems appropriate, or just do it.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim, I second Alan and Sarah: my page of reminders is just like your Outlook reminders, except I prefer glancing at the page throughout the day. For reasons I cannot explain, I do not usually need a reminder to look at the page. But if I feel like I might, I can write "Today: keep current" in C2.<br><br>Alan, the only reason I don't just write "gym" in my system and let the details live in their own workout notebook is that my workout does not happen in one session. One exercise (potentially two or three) calls for super-slow single reps, throughout the day. We can call it "little and often" exercise ;->. Since my schedule only allows this during certain intervals of the day, I need my reminder page to show me how many reps I have left when I am looking for next-actions. Otherwise, I will do the first rep before breakfast, and I will not think about the rest until I am making dinner. You might think this would fall into a regular routine after a while, but the reps vary randomly from day to day (keep the body guessing and all that—I actually roll dice).<br><br>I do realize this is not exactly a widespread concern in the exercise field ;->. Yet, I imagine there are other types of tasks that people are having to spread throughout the day like this. Day traders checking a stock price? Maybe not.<br><br>In any case, even this unorthodox routine can be handled with C1, C2, and a "today list."</div>

<div class="content">Bernie, Sarah, Alan - It seems the Today stickie / card / page is a low-tech tickler that feeds into C2 whenever the time seems right.  Is that correct?  I like it -- I really wish I could get by without the reminders.  I hate being so dependent on the PC.  Maybe I'll give your approach another try.</div>

<div class="content">I do that when my big list gets overwhelming, but usually weekly rather than daily. I also include a place to record time spent on little-and-often tasks and anything from the big list that needs to be done this week. I usually review the big list while creating the weekly list.<br><br>That way, all my truly urgent and important tasks are on one page. I work through this page each day before opening the big list. I treat it like AF to decide what to do when and for how long. I don't necessarily do all the tasks, but each one gets considered and I can see which little-and-often projects are getting less (or more) attention than the others.<br><br>Once I'm done that list, I can go to the big list knowing that everything is under control.<br><br>Every day or two, the big list gets reviewed for things that should be moved to the weekly list. If I know I won't look at the big list for a few days, I copy over everything that must be done before I expect to get to it again.<br><br>If things get really hectic, I create another layer covering only a few days.<br><br>I find this weekly layer reassuring. I know there's nothing important and urgent lurking on another page of the big list.<br><br>New tasks that can be done any time get added to the big list. If they need to be done during the week they go on the weekly list.</div>

<div class="content">> I find this weekly layer reassuring. I know there's nothing important and urgent lurking on another page of the big list.<br><br>Cricket, I like this, especially the way you are treating it by AF rules. The "big list" then becomes a bit like Someday/Maybe, but instead of being basically "inactive" until the next Gigantic Review, it is always incrementally active. My Someday/Maybe quickly became Someday/Never, so this "incrementally active" thing is important. I guess there is some danger of slowing the big list, getting more and more diverted to the weekly list, but one just needs an appropriate reminder or process to look back at it, as you have outlined.</div>

<div class="content">I found a big list was just to much to handle, but many things I don't want to leave totally inactive got lost when I didn't write them down.<br><br>My big list is much slower than standard, which may be why SF doesn't work for me. However, whenever the weekly list assures me I have time, or tells me to check it so nothing is missed, it gets looked at.</div>

<div class="content">Cricket, I too find your system very interesting. <br><br>Keep in mind, I'm just talking about my home-stuff here. I have a SF book for work, but it's not part of this discussion. <br><br>I LOVE SF. I've gotten more done on long put-off projects and more random one-off's done than ever. But I still haven't gotten it to work well with my 'daily/every few days'/weekly-ish sorts of things. The main reason is that the book is my faithful companion on weekends and other non-work days. But I'll jot things down in it occasionally during the work week, but I don't 'work it'. I started SF during a week break in February. I'm just now starting Spring Break. I'm sure it'll be fantastic this week, but come Monday 4/4, it'll be 'just ok'. <br><br>I'm using a bookmark that I've been trying different groups of tasks on. And I've tweaked it and tweaked it. And it's getting closer to representing the tasks that I want/need to keep track of that repeat often. But I find that I just don't refer to it often enough M-F. <br><br>I'm interested in the physical characteristics of your two lists. I suppose if I was having my issue and I was in an environment where I sat at my desk regularly, I'd just keep my 'bookmark list' on my desk or bulletin board. But I don't venture into my office at home on a regular basis. I should, but I don't. <br><br>Maybe that part should be something digital. I'm attached to my laptop or ipad at home more than in my office.<br><br>But I REALLY like the tactile-ness of paper. And I like to look back and see what I've done, even if for repeating tasks.</div>

<div class="content">I write my Sf home list in the back end of a medium sized notebook. My today list is a small paper clipped to the active page.  The front page of my book is dedicated to the daily stuff and it's checklists. I don't get into SF every day, but nearly always go through checklists.</div>

I always put too much on the form, and projects changed almost every week.

Deadlines and start-dates are noted. If I don't know how long a project will take, it becomes a LAO so I look at it on the first day. The first task is, of course, decide how much I need to work on it.<br><br>I don't need to list things that are done more than once a day, but if they did I'd find a way to put it on the weekly list.<br><br>I work the entire list in AF mode -- read it all first thing in the morning, then do what stands out. If nothing is more important that day, LAOs get priority. Experience has shown that they will be neglected otherwise. I've already decided that everything on the week list is more important than anything not on it, so I have to finish the week list before looking at the big list.<br><br>My big list is complicated. It's between systems. It's a combination of AF1 and DWM with some DIT, with the remains of an attempt at SF. Part of it is a datebook where I write tasks on the date I next want to do them. I review this when I create each week list.<br><br>I used to keep a grid of weekly tasks, with weeks across the top for several months, but tasks changed too often. Same with a grid of daily tasks for the month. The week list is a good balance for me.<br><br>As for your list, why do you keep it at your home desk if you never go there?<br><br>My kids' lists live on the kitchen walls. The permanent list has morning, afternoon and bedtime routines. They're pen on paper, not etched in stone. The other is on a whiteboard and changes often. They can do the tasks in any order (like AF), with some guidance: The house is quiet now, but won't be once your sister gets home. Yes, I still have to spot-check whether they really did everything, but that's parenting. At least they can't whine, "You didn't tell me to unpack my lunch dishes before TV."<br><br>My lists stay in the house. They're bulky. If I need to take a list with me, I take a separate sheet. Notes made while out of the house go in a book I keep in my purse. Anything can go in that book. Meeting notes, reminders, doodles, anything. I always have the right book with me. A recurring home task is, "review purse book (and bedside book and voicemail and email)".</div>

<div class="content">I'm both. When I'm working, I need a short list of things to focus on. Everything else can wait. When I'm planning, I need a full list of things to consider, so nothing is forgotten. That's why I have the week list. I can spend most of the week on the short list, but at least once a week everything on the big list gets re-evaluated.<br><br>I make the week list with that in mind. Anything that needs to be re-evaluated before the next one is made goes on this week's list as "think about". I leave the original entry on the big list, so if the result of "think about" is "don't do this week", the dismissal rules apply to the first (old) entry.</div>

It serves to frame the day and ensure the critical stuff is done. <br><br>After this, the Majority of people operate instinct or habit to fill the day. Here we have SF to help.

<div class="content">I put a small circle to the left side of any task that needs to be done this week (but not necessarily today).  This helps them stand out so I can review them at the beginning of the day (and add to C2 when appropriate).<br><br>I draw horizontal and vertical lines through tasks as Mark has suggested elsewhere in the forums.  The intersection is in the middle of the circle when I cross them out.  So, they are obvious when I need to be reminded that they are pressing, yet almost disappear when they have been worked.  And...I can add the circle anytime without rewriting or fiddling.<br><br>C1 is my master task list...C2 is my DAILY todo list, and items with the circles in front are this WEEK's tasks.  It's been a really easy way for me to keep perspective on the level of urgency of everything, without much overhead, rewriting, etc.  Just love how SF3 does what it's supposed to without me having to spend time and effort managing a "system".</div>

<div class="content">I've resolved now to have an item called Today in C2.  To do that item, I look at the today stuff, including calendar, daily and weekly habits, and the items that ought to be done today, and do somethings. Reenter Today on the next page, and if something I worked is incomplete, also reenter that next page. Thus the Today list is subservient to the SF list.</div>
