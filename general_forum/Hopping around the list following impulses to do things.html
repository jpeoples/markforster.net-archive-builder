<div class="content">Is anyone else finding themselves hopping around the list?  A very strong desire to do things that are on the list somewhere but not on my active page are coming along regularly.  Some are things I had not felt like doing when coming to them on the list, so I've been going along with the urge to do them.  I didn't feel this before this last week.</div>

<div class="content">I often find, when I start reading down a new page of my notebook, that I've already done many of the things on that page. And some of those were things I'd been putting off for a while.<br><br>In the past, I'd write something down somewhere then never really think about it again unless I was doing a "review" of some kind. With AF, I write tasks down, but I still see them over and over again as I work through the notebook. This keeps them relatively fresh in my mind, even when I'm away from the notebook.</div>

<div class="content">I thought I was possibly rebelling against following instructions like you "have to" do one item and have to stick to the pages in order.  I kind of had that feeling of defiance when I was doing it.  Strange how that is quite a good feeling.</div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline:<br><br>If it works for you, then I'm not going to try to advise you out of it. I think we all (myself included) make exceptions at times. The real question though is what you do after you have made the exception. Do you go back to working systematically through the list, or does it throw you off for hours, days or even weeks?</div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline<br><br>I've been having exactly the same experience.  In a couple of instances, I have done the item and felt fine about it, but I have not crossed it off the lists until I next get to the page it was on, and I just continue from where I am.  However the fact that this was happening did set me thinking and I posted a couple of days ago about an experiment I was going to try and report back on (which I haven't yet!).</div>

<div class="content">Christine, I go hunting for it and cross it off at that time.<br><br>The jury's out as to whether it will affect my regular lists or not.  I spent the evening doing taxes which was on the list but not on my active page.   I was motivated to do it because my son's final tax receipt came in the mail today.  I felt kind of guilty though because I actually enjoy doing it, although I have procrastinated to the last minute and been late many times over the years.  Just a couple of more receipts to get and I can file - just 2 months early. :-)<br><br>Part of it could be that I've reviewed my lists so many times that I have them memorized. Perhaps I am automatically gravitating towards some of the older tasks that are on the list and have been passed over many times because they're sticking in my mind.<br><br>Or I could just be avoiding the housecleaning tasks that are on my active pages... :-)<br></div>

<div class="content">Like Christine, I don't cross an item off if it's not on my active page. I know I'll come across it eventually. If it's a one-time thing, I'll cross it off. It it's a recurring task, I'll treat it like any other item in my notebook, doing it if it stands out, passing it by if it doesn't.</div>

<div class="meta">2009-03-4 18:52</div>
<div class="content">One of the things I have found about not crossing the item off until I return to the page in the normal course of things, is that the crossing off of the item has an effect on the page which can be missed if done out of sequence.  For example I reached a page and crossed of a couple of items that had already been done.  That left me with only two items remaining, neither of which I wished to do.  The crossing off of those items enabled me to move forward, but more importantly made me aware that on the next pass those items need to be addressed (or at least one of them does!).  That obviously got my subconscious working because I already "want" to do one of the items - which I have resisted for a long time - it was entered onto my list on Day 1 of Beta Testing!</div>

<div class="content">I get the same effect as Christine, only earlier since when I go hunting for it and cross it off, right then I sometimes get an urge to do another of these long-avoided tasks on the same (always older) page.  Possibly because I'm having a sense of accomplishment and feel I can do anything.  I'm learning that if I have that feeling, I'm running with it as long as possible if it means getting some of these old tasks done.<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br><br>I understand what you're saying but my feeling is that doing the odd task out of sequence should not become a common occurrence.  Do you feel that you might be running the risk of clearing what are currently the "easiest" tasks (albeit resisted previously) and altering the consistency of the flow of AF?</div>

<div class="meta">2009-03-5 1:53</div>
<div class="content">I'm finding that I'm picking the harder ones to do - or what others might consider harder - more involved and longer, I guess.   I don't have anything on my list that I'm really dreading though - at least not anymore now that I've broken everything down with AF, so I can't say, just some things that are kind of unpleasant but not a big deal.  I resent the time they take away from my leisure time, not the actual doing of them.  If I only worked a 35 hour week or something, I wouldn't have a problem doing them at all.   Although I wouldn't have as good of a system to make sure everything gets done without AF.  :-)<br><br>I have a somewhat eidetic memory so I just review the lists mentally and pick something to do without looking at the book.  It seems to have got my enthusiasm back up anyway, as I polished off another 5 tasks completely out of order during my lunch hour today and I don't usually feel like doing my list then - primarily phone calls that I could do at work anyway.  <br><br>Or maybe I just like that feeling of choosing absolutely whatever I want to do no matter what page it's on.   And I'm okay with that as long as I finish off the oldest tasks on a timely basis.  I'm still following the "rules" at work though and that's working fine.  If I get to a point where my enthusiasm wanes, I'll start following it to the letter, I think.<br><br>Anyway, I've got to go assemble a dryer hose now. :-)<br></div>

<div class="content">Out of curiosity do you have statistics identifying how many tasks you still have outstanding over how many pages?  It struck me from your comment "If I only worked a 35 hour week or something, I wouldn't have a problem doing them at all" that you may have a lot less items outstanding than I do.  My backlogs mean that I will be likely to have crisis points and urgency issues for some time to come and in that scenario any diversion from pure AF other than an occasional diversion could be very detrimental. My gut feeling is that it is safe for me to make the occasion excursion outside of AF but any lengthy diversion could create a real problem.</div>

<div class="content">Keeping in mind that I have 2 books - one for work and one for home, there's nothing that I have in my home book that would become a crisis if I didn't do it for a month or more except some dirty laundry and having to eat off paper plates. :-)  By the 35 hour/week comment, I meant that if I had more free time, I wouldn't resent spending my free time on cleaning and home renos.<br><br>HOME book:  Re. stats on my home book - I have 25 total pages (29 lines/page) & 22 active pages = ~ 725 total tasks, about 65 dismissed, so 660 undismissed tasks in total.  Of these, about 25% are active.  I have to confess that a few of my earliest active pages have items that I am delaying due to weather / cold temperatures / icy roads (the groundhog must not have seen his shadow this year!) and I haven't dismissed them b/c it seems kind of silly to do so - eg. top up windshield washer fluid, book motorhome awning repair.  <br><br>WORK book:   5 active pages (all active), no dismissed tasks, 29 lines per page so ~ 140 tasks w/~ 70% complete.  This isn't normal however, since I just started using AF for this job on 2/18 and started the job on the day AF came out.   I also don't feel the need to chunk things down into small tasks at work like I do at home.<br><br>I have never been much of a procrastinator or behind in my work in my various jobs so I have to admit I've never had a backlog at work.  If I've had to work o.t. it's because I've been in a job that was deadline dependent (eg. external reporting, audit, tax season).  I'm usually doing something I enjoy and make the effort to ensure my overall job suits what I like to do.  It's my home life where I've procrastinated that tends to suffer and has caused me anxiety in the past.  <br><br>I am absolutely NOT a "do-er" at work, I am a person who likes working ON the job, not IN the job.  In an ideal work environment, I typically spend 50% or more of my time making the job/processes simpler, automating, eliminating redundancies and 50% actually doing something - managing, meetings, doing stuff.  If it means working a few hours of OT to make modifications to a system/process that will save 20 hours every month, I consider it time well spent.<br><br>Part of the issue is that my "work" at home is not open to being drastically reduced by systems - other than getting toys like my little robots, I can't see a way to automate housecleaning - other than paying for it, of course.  I already have a batch system (OAMC-style) for cooking so that I don't have to really cook more than once every 2 weeks or so, although I enjoy doing it, just not during the week when I'm rushed.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br><br>That's really interesting - your work approach is very similar to my "ideal" - the working ON the job as opposed to IN it but not always one that was possible for me.  Your description of the home vs work items makes me realise that my comments regarding working "off list" would actually feel different as to whether they were work or home items (which for me are all in one list).  Generally speaking my comments are more focused on the work items - on my home items I am now finding that they are standing out at more appropriate times for me (ie evenings and weekends) and there is definitely more "off course" action in those times.<br><br>Thank you for helping me clarify that to myself! .....:-)</div>

<div class="content">Christine, I think it's my inherent laziness that compels me to work *on* the job.  I don't like working any more than necessary, and because I've always received very nice bonuses for eliminating positions, tasks etc., I've been very motivated to do so.  <br><br>This is an excellent quote (General Erich von Manstein):<br><br>"There are only four types of officer. First, there are the lazy, stupid ones. Leave them alone, they do no harm. Second, there are the hard-working, intelligent ones. They make excellent staff officers, ensuring that every detail is properly considered. Third, there are the hard-working, stupid ones. These people are a menace and must be fired at once. They create irrelevant work for everybody. Finally, there are the intelligent, lazy ones. They are suited for the highest office."<br><br>I love taking over jobs that hard working people used to do, they usually can't see the forest for the trees.  When I have *thinking time* - and I have ALOT of it, that's what I usually think about - how can I make this job simpler, often it's just pushing your department's agenda and getting the existing systems to work for you.<br><br>There's an excellent book called "Slack" - author Tom DeMarco - it should be required reading for managers everywhere:<br><br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Slack-Getting-Burnout-Busywork-Efficiency/dp/0767907698/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1236304469&sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Slack-Getting-Burnout-Busywork-Efficiency/dp/0767907698/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1236304469&sr=8-1</a><br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Not trying to justify myself further here - but... :-)<br><br>In Do It Tomorrow, Mark says that "the right place for prioritising is at the level of goals and commitments" and "once you've made a commitment, all the work relevant to it needs to be done."  <br><br>So if a project I've committed to is to renovate the house, I don't really understand why, if I have a strong desire to remove baseboards (on page 10 of the list) vs. spackle the wall (on the active page), that's necessarily a bad thing.  Both of these tasks need to be done to renovate the house, and both WILL be done - and in fact the project may move faster because I've got the enthusiasm to remove the baseboards but rather than spackle the wall, I might decide I feel tired and want to go to bed or watch TV.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br><br>I always enjoy your posts - they make me think.  I suspect you can relate to this as an ON rather than IN person, but I always want to identify why something works (or doesn't) as well as what works (or doesn't!).  I'm not convinced that the working ON the job is a sign of inherent laziness at all.  I think it is a specific skill, to be able to recognise how systems can be improved or why something doesn't work.  I have to say I was convinced before AF that a lot of my procrastination was laziness but now believe that it was down to the fact that the things I was trying to do had other factors attached (eg oughts, when to do them, obligation, boredom etc)  AF has all but eliminated many of those factors in that it has enabled to identify those factors, move them out of the way and do the tasks without all of their accompanying baggage.<br><br>I had always considered that I loved creating systems but hated following them.  That is true but only to a degree.  At that time I had not recognised that I was trying to deal with tasks and their baggage.  Now AF is my baggage handler so that aspect is not my job anymore :-)<br><br>In the example you give of the two house reno tasks, I think I would do exactly the same.  If I use general housework as a similar example, when "clean the sink" (or even just "coffee") stands out, I will find myself happily stacking the dishwasher, cleaning the sides, putting stuff away and generally addressing any aspects of a "clear the kitchen" project that I feel like doing.  Hey - I'm on a roll!  I'm not going to stop that!!  The only danger I can see - and this is where I feel that being aware of the total content of our lists is essential - is that my enthusiasm for that project will take me away from other things that do have an urgency.  However, generally speaking that has not happened - at least not in that scenario - although has in others (on which I will post separately!)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine, I'm glad to provide you with some entertainment!  Here's some more...<br><br>"Some people see things that are and ask, 'Why?' Some people dream of things that never were and ask, 'Why not?' Some people have to go to work and don't have time for all that."<br><br>~ George Carlin ~<br><br>I think that because AF is a holistic system (def: emphasizing the organic or functional relation between parts and the whole) it can get at the core of issues that most people (myself included) don't ever get the opportunity to examine.  By encouraging dismissing of items we can confront that we just aren't that committed to that particular project / person etc. and can realize that some things really don't need to be done in order for our lives to work well.  All other time management systems will tell you to just schedule it in and bear down and do it - what's the matter with you that you can't do that?  It's logical !  But we're not robots that can be scheduled like my little vacuum cleaner that I can program to come on at a certain time, vacuum the house and return to its charger when it's done.<br><br>It's allowed me to identify my overwhelm with the house reno, which although I was consciously very aware of it, I wasn't sure of how to work past it.   But by dumping 50% of my projects into the system, then looking at it a few weeks later to say "what the heck are you doing?  Of course you're overwhelmed if that's how you see this!" gave me a focus that had previously escaped me for the last 4 years.<br><br>I've also come to the realization that, being a person who doesn't like *doing*, just working on ways to get out of doing things, of course I don't like the never ending drudge of housework!   There's a *doing* project if there ever was one.  And seeing it all laid out on my AF list allows me to see what a never ending project it is.  Do dishes, cross off, re-enter.  Do laundry, cross off, re-enter.  Ugh!  But there are things I can do to set up a structure that makes this easier too.  For example, seeing the recycling task on my AF list over and over again makes me realize that perhaps I should invest in curb side recycling or save my bottles for the fund drives that come through.  Seeing "clean oven" and feeling a lot of resistance to it on my list allows me to realize that I hate cleaning ovens and want new appliances when I sell the house, so why not invest in a self cleaning oven now?  Knowing that I hate doing dishes and my dishwasher has been broken for a year makes me realize I should stop putting off buying another just so the person buying the house can benefit.  Realizing that the toilets in the house have lost their ceramic coating, so never really come clean no matter how hard or often I scrub them makes me acknowledge I shouldn't put off buying new ones.  That's the working *on* the job, rather than just doing it that can get me excited even if it's something as mundane as housework. :-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br><br>I love seeing the way in which AF can enable us to confront things - don't you think it ironic that we can go into a place of work, see straight away what is working and identify how to change it, yet suffer through domestic niggles because "it must be us".<br><br>One of the most amusing things to me, is the fact that I had what seemed to be a pretty reasonable system for shredding.  Shredding went into a box under my desk, and periodically was shredded.  Usually took a couple of sessions because the shredder cuts out if it overheats but no major problem.  Shredding went onto my AF list. AF suggested I move my shredder - about 6".   Now when I have shredding I just reach under my desk and shred it!  Duh!</div>

But I was over at the neighbors and they bought a new Bosh dishwasher.  I know that because I saw a light and asked about what it was.  The dishwasher was running.  Really!  I can't hear a thing.

<div class="content">Mark, I concede defeat and am starting to believe that you have psychic powers from the comment you posted above which I've copied below:<br><br>" The real question though is what you do after you have made the exception. Do you go back to working systematically through the list, or does it throw you off for hours, days or even weeks? "<br><br>I am now looking at a very messy house as a result of my hopping around.  The truth is that I have to take care of it regularly because it quickly gets out of hand if I don't.  Dog, cat, kids...  I fear I used my justification of following my impulses just to avoid doing that work which I don't like to do.<br><br>I also found that hopping around on my list seemed to make me want to hop around OFF the list as well.  With my home reno, I initially put a whole bunch of reno project tasks into AF (a few next actions for what is really about 50 different projects), a couple of weeks later I decided I needed to refine the list because I was getting overwhelmed thinking about it so I dismissed a large number of tasks.  With the hopping around I did in the last week or so, I've found myself thinking, hmmm, even though the office isn't done, I really *feeeeel like* working on the spare room (dismissed off the list 6 weeks ago) and maybe I should just follow this impulse...  DUMB idea.  I don't want every room in my house to be in a state of chaos all at the same time!!<br><br>I found myself hopping off the list too much at work as well where the system was working perfectly fine before.<br><br>I have learned something from this however - I need to be hyper-vigilant about not putting too many things/areas of interest on the list, and/or I need to dismiss a lot more liberally and sooner than I have been.  I need to use the list to pull me towards the things I wanted to hop over to.  If I want to start on the spare room so darn bad, I'd better get that office/library done first.  I won't get the feeling of accomplishment and closure if I don't - it's no good to be a great starter and poor finisher.  <br><br>Thanks for the words of caution, I might not have recognized the trap I was falling into as quickly if you hadn't mentioned it, and heaven forbid, I may have fallen away from the system thinking "there's another thing that doesn't work."<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br><br>Just a quick word of caution from your comment "I need to use the list to pull me towards the things I wanted to hop over to" is not to try that the way I did (see my posts on Experiment 1) by selecting what items I added to the list and how.<br><br>When there are tasks that we somehow feel a real "need" to have done there is such a strong temptation to try to force - of course I mean gently encourage :-) - AF to do things our way.  I think I'm learning the answer is "Don't even bother - it's going to do things it's way anyway so why fight it! :-)<br></div>

<div class="content">I definitely have this inclination. We were redoing our basement for a couple of weeks and I did very little on my list. How I manage this proclivity for going off list is to truly STAY off list. In other words, if you're going to do what you want to do, just do it and don't even LOOK at the list. When you are using the list, use it as instructed. After all, we don't have to be on-list 24/7, right? When I come to a page that has a task I've done while off-list, I mark it off. If there are no other tasks that stand out, I don't dismiss the page because I "count" the off-list task. Because I am so prone to rebelling against rules & obligation, it works well for me to be off-list if I choose or on. Hope that helps someone else.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine,<br><br>I wonder if our projects are somewhat different in that mine are nothing that I *have to* have done, ie. I won't lose a client or not deliver something to someone else I've promised because I haven't done them.  My projects (at home anyway) are completely at my discretion other than that I want to have the house completely renovated in 10 months.  I don't have to do so, however it would mean I'd be postponing my retirement if I didn't - and I don't want to spend another winter in this frigid climate.  If I fall behind, I'll just pay to get things done that I wanted to do myself.  And I'm cheap, so that will be more painful than doing it myself. :-)  <br><br>My resistance at home seems to stem entirely from feelings of overwhelm and by limiting what I put into the system by narrowing my focus to ONE room, and if necessary, ONE project in that room, that will hopefully lower my resistance.<br><br>I also found that by dumping my flylady control journal into my AF list was counter-productive - it made me feel overwhelmed by the sheer enormity of cleaning.  So I'm going to pare down to the basics until I get some sort of routine established.<br><br>I simply don't have resistance to any projects related to my work.  I've only been that way for the last 8 years or so since I've ensured that I either take jobs / contracts I'm suited for or have changed my job to suit me.  I've also hopped around ALOT which means I get the benefit of constant change and learning and get to work on systems - improve them, then leave once it gets boring or the contract is up.  When I was self-employed for a number of years, I felt huge resistance a great deal of the time and had to constantly use the push mode and procrastinated until work became a crisis situation.  I was in the wrong profession for me at the time however.<br><br>I see a lot of highlighting in my future. :-)<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Mel, were you just focusing on your basement (like a current initiative concept)?  My issue is that I start tackling pieces of other rooms but I'm not so good on the finishing.  I appear to love pulling things apart - perhaps I should be a demolition person in my next life.<br>I also find that other things that are important to me don't get done when I get absorbed in a project, like dishes, laundry, time with my kids - I even let walking the dog slide, which never happens!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br><br>I'm sure that I do have some projects that are very different from the "have to be done" perspective (in that I would not choose to have them but rather that they are a result of previous decisions - a bit like your wrong jobs).  However when I referred to tasks I "need" to do, it wasn't just those sort of tasks I was referring to but tasks like your home reno project.  You don't have to do it in that the sky will not fall down if you don't but you do have to do it because that is a decision you have made.  I think that those kind of tasks can often present us with a major problem - we have them on our list because we have made a choice to do them, which we equate with wanting to do them.  However we then equate wanting with liking which may not be the case at all.  Until we recognise that we may not actually "like" some of the tasks that we have made a decision to do then it is hard to find the right way to reduce resistance.  Our subconscious is saying "I don't like this" yet our conscious mind is saying "I must like it because I chose to do it".<br><br>Feelings of overwhelm are common and are natural.  If we don't "like" a project for whatever reason, chances are that we will have procrastinated on it sufficiently in the past, that it is very difficult for it to be completed within the "deadline" (however that is arrived at) without a fair degree of stress attached.</div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline:<br><br>Can I be "psychic" again and say that I don't think either dumping your entire Flylady control list into AF or restricting the areas of interest that you put in AF is the right way to proceed.<br><br>The recommended way is to let your list grow organically. That is to say, start it with a few items of immediate concern and just add other tasks as you think of them or as they come up. Resist any tendency to dump things en masse into into AF, but also resist any tendency to censor what you put on the list.<br><br>That way you will have a list which is alive and relevant to what your actual current concerns are.<br></div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the advice Mark, yes I regret every time I did a dump into the system, and I did it more than once.  A case of the eyes being bigger than the stomach.  Needless to say, the highlighter got a workout this morning. :-)<br><br>I dismissed based on "am I committed to doing this task / start this project by the end of March?"  I initially thought maybe I should begin another book to start fresh, but instead, I put in an item at the end of the list to review my dismissed items.  Knowing they're there but dismissed - for now - will hopefully remind me of the lesson I've learned.  I think I need a reality check once in awhile.  <br><br>Thank you once again for your sage advice.<br></div>

<div class="content">Jacqueline, yes it was just my basement. It was "the carpet has just been laid; help me put everything back in the room" kind of stuff. No time for AF lists. :-) <br><br>I'm a homeschooler and one of the concepts familiar to homeschoolers is the notion that kids who are burned out on traditional school need time to learn what they'd like to learn. If kids are given a time of "unschooling," they will be ready once again for more traditional education. It seems to me that you could benefit from some "uncleaning" time. Use the list as Mark suggests and simply do what you feel led to do and nothing else. You'll be amazed how the "want to" will come back, sometimes when you least expect it. After all, even when you let things go, you didn't let them go ad infinitum. You were ready to take care of business at a certain point. That's a perfectly acceptable approach in my opinion. Of course, you may very well decide you don't like feast or famine, so you will begin taking care of things sooner rather than later.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Mel, I've had 4 years of "uncleaning time" though !  :-)  And my "taking care of business" point is when people are coming over - and I am one of those CHAOS "Can't Have Any One over Syndrome" people, so I avoid having people come over.  And it becomes overwhelming and depressing to me.  I have been making progress though and without a lot of agony, so I'm willing to take baby steps, acknowledging that my baby steps may revert to crawling occasionally. :-)<br><br>I haven't always been this way however, and I want to get back to that point again.<br><br>OT Mel, but can you please recommend a good resource for unschooling?  I'll be pulling my 8 y.o. out of school next year on my sabbatical for 6 months and need some good direction.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br>I took to Flylady's system very easily because I silted it down from all those scary lists.  <br>The most important thing is keep things where they belong as you naturally live your day, not letting them lay about.  <br>Bottom Line:<br><br>1.AMs<br>2.PMs<br>2a. Mid Day (this is my deviation, not the system proper)<br>2.b Eve (again, my deviation...to remember to relieve dog and remember to eat a meal!  memory issues)<br>3. Check/Do Laundry<br>4. Weeklies<br>5. 15" Zone  (I don't do it this way: I chunked it into one day as a weekly because after awhile it only takes about 15-30minutes a week! I'm not a clutterer...mine's mostly monthly cleaning)<br>6. Seasonal charts (I keep mine as tickler/calendar items but I'm suggesting this for possible AF integration<br>See?  You don't really need all those lists.  You can refer to them separately when needed but most of it gets habituated.<br>Hope this helps.<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">p.s.<br>I'm sure that lots of this is already engrained for you so my may not need the detail of reminders that I need. ....but just playing it safe.  Even Marla said that she had to LEARN to follow the "leave no footprint" rule because her Mother kept the house ship shape on her own and didn't teach things to her.  We had a maid yet.....I was raised military style!  LOL!  (my dad....we had to follow the rule....Why have a maid, we'd query?  He said her job is to CLEAN  not to put your slack on her back!  LOL!  He used to grill us what that line over and over....even if we were ill.  You can do your chores....otherwise they go on the back of your siblings!  LOL!  Most people notice TIDY more than squeeky clean.  That's why Flylady advocates "swiping" LOL!  (We called it "top cleaning")<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br>Don't put much worry into it....the babysteps do work.  And....if you're too busy or tired to clean, just keep things where they belong and do a quick swipe in the bath and kitchen...the rest will hold just fine ....even then....15" will do a lot.....SO WILL well-strategized 5"!!!!!  LOL!  You'll do fine!!!!!  I OFTEN do projects...when you're on vacation the only thing that's different when you come back are<br>1. dust levels<br>2. mail<br>3. messages (phone, email, etc)<br>4. laundry (if you didn't do it while on vacation)<br>When you're on an EXCELLENT RUN with your project, the dust, paper and messages will hold!  LOL!   Just remember....these things are the only things that change!  I always honor these FLOW times!  LOL!  House stuff is necessary but it's easier to manage when we see it for what it really is. It's only a bit of boring scutwork what we only have to do in little bits, yeah?<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Hi Jacqueline<br>You're welcome.  I'll further state that I believe that general TIDINESS is 95% of making a home presentable, welcoming and livable. LOL!  No big detailed cleaning jags!  Just tidy and strategic swiping! for company!  LOL!  The cleaning is far less time consuming but this habit isn't noticed once you think of put away as the last part of the action sequence!  LOL!   Our maid used to arrive at 9am and leave at 3pm 5 days a week and 4 hours on Saturday.  I firmly believe that she was a victim of Parkinson's Law!  LOL!<br><br>Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.<br><br>Flylady's lists overwhelmed me so I conducted an experiment.  Also I don't want to do a second more of house scutwork more  than is absolutely necessary , particularly because of my pain!  I made a Zone lists (detailed cleaning) AS I did the work and dated each one.  Then I checked it each month.  I made several discoveries!  The house stays cleaner longer than we were led to believe!  Example: No more MONTHLY window washing.....it's a waste of time and effort.....Now I do them each season instead.  There were many others as well.  Bottom Line:  The house needs relatively little detail cleaning.  It survives quite well with swiping (top cleaning) as needed!  LOL!  <br>Make your own list based on what your house needs not some generalized formula....believe me, it's FAR LESS than the maids or hous frau's tell us!  LOL!<br>learning as I go</div>

<div class="content">Hi learning as I go<br><br>Some great tips there.  A friend said to me yesterday, when I bemoaned the fact that my apartment was getting untidy (WHY won't these tasks stand out???), that it didn't matter 'cos it was always clean.  I guess I can look on the bright side - if there's dust it's probably now underneath the current clutter! <br><br>I think the big issue is to have things at a level we are comfortable with, not up to standards imposed by others that we are not happy with - but making sure we don't get to the CHAOS (Can't Have Anyone Over Syndrome) stage.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine<br>The secret?  Don't think of tidy as a separate task unless you're doing a quick run through because someone is coming over.  Even then, it won't usually be much.  I'm scattered brained so I'm usually closing open cabinet doors or moving some of the coats from the hallway clothes tree to make room.   Most tidying will disappear if you habitualize the "Leave no footprints" rule.  After awhile you'll feel out of sync if you don't do it!  Sometimes I have to stop during projects to put some of the tools away as I progress so that it won't turn into a "task", see?  It becomes part of the natural sequence for most of living....yet, with projects, I always have to stop and wash some of my paintbrushes, swipe my color palette,put away tools, do a mid way vac for wood shavings, etc......Tidying during my projects takes my active attention because I'm busy creating, building, etc....I also have to tell myself to tidy my office desk when I'm done, LOL!  Most of the rest of it is habitualized because it's done in sequence so often in a day.  You'd be surprized how often we're putting things away!  LOL!   Far more accumulated time than actual cleaning!<br>Also, just to be safe I'll check the bathroom and kitchen to make sure they don't need an extra swipe just to be doubly sure.....especially the Loo!  LOL!<br>learning as I go<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi learning as I go<br><br>My biggest problem is an overabundance of stuff and very limited space - homes being a lot smaller this side of the Atlantic!  It doesn't help that I have a lot of stuff from my former business, plus my parents stuff, and a storage unit full of that to sort out.  That is one of my major AF projects.<br><br>The frustrating thing is that I have no problem sorting things for others when they need to declutter, reorganise etc.  But I am getting there with the help of my lists! :-)</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christine, limited space can be a blessing though - I have a very large house now and it's allowed me to accumulate way too much junk.  I'm never happier than when I'm in my 24' RV traveling with just the bare minimum which is still a lot more than living out of a suitcase or backpacking along the Appalachian trail !<br>I have stuff from my former business as well - just 8 years ago!  I find AF handles the whole decluttering amazingly well.  I actually look forward to it a lot now, happy that someone's finding a use for what I had too much of.</div>
