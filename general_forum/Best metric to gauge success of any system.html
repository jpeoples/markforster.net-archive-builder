<div class="content">For example, AF1:<br><br>What metric would you use to gauge the effectiveness of using Autofocus (and as a side benefit, the method of tracking would help encourage the user to use said system)?<br><br>1. Tasks completed or re-entered  i.e. 34 tasks completed/re-entered on Tuesday<br>2. Time in system i.e. Monday: 45 minutes spent in AF mode, Tuesday 75 minutes, etc<br>3. Mood i.e. Using AF, my mood was 6/10</div>

<div class="content">avrum:<br><br><< How do you measure that? >><br><br>There are several different ways depending on how detailed you want the results. Here's a couple:<br><br>1) Keep an achievement diary in which you write down each day everything that you have brought to a successful conclusion or made significant progress on. Don't forget to include the small things like "Kept my email up to date", as well as the big ones "Landed the contract with MegaBank". You might also want to keep a record of things you have decided not to do at all or for the time being.<br><br>2) Keep a list with columns for tasks and each day of the week/month.  Enter the tasks you have worked on in column 1 and tick in the day-columns each day you work on it. At the end of the week/month draw up a summary with comments.</div>

<div class="content">I like having quantitive and qualitative metrics, this seems to give me a more balanced perspective. <br><br>Quantitative: Starts and stops are logged against 'chunks' of work - visible to see any time. <br><br>Qualitative: Self rating satisfaction scale completed at end of each week - visible to see by looking back over previous weeks. <br><br>These ideas are part of a system I have been developing since the beginning of this year. I'll probably make a video and / or write an ebook if it continues to go well.</div>

<div class="content">A major problem with using quantitative suggestions to track success, productivity, etc.:  <br><br>Last week, my kids were sick. The all-night coughing, staying home from school, etc, took a toll on my sleep, productivity, etc. Without taking this into consideration, my measurements would only reflect a reduced workflow. Not helpful at all. <br><br>A solution (using AF 1):<br>Begin the day by dating the last page, and adding a few bits of info about mood, sleep and circumstantial stuff (do the same at the end of the day). Sandwiched in-between these journal entries would be reentered tasks/projects, new tasks/projects, waiting-fors, etc. During a weekly review, my hunch is that these begin/end journal entries will provide meaning into what made it onto the AF 1 page.</div>
