<div class="content">*Not* strictly about time/tasks, but sharing here because the description of moving items from list to list struck me as an interesting overlay with our favorite MF systems!<br><br>Memorize language vocabulary with the Goldlist method<br>The Goldlist method is a language learning technique that involves writing down lists of phrases you would like to learn in a notebook. Each page of the notebook is divided into four sections (1, 2, 3, 4). Every day, you write a list of 8-10 new words or phrases in section 1. After a week, you test yourself on the list, copying incorrect answers to section 2. This process is repeated, moving forgotten phrases to subsequent sections every 7 days.</div>
