<div class="content">I often use this site (no affiliation):<br><br>www.readitswapit.co.uk<br><br>I have bought a lot of books over the years - some I no longer want.  For the cost of postage you can swap with other members for books you may want.  The concept is very easy and to set up a list of books you want to sell, you only have to enter the ISPN number from the back of the book.<br><br>I notice there are a couple of copies of Mark's books for those of you who may not have a copy or can't afford to buy one.  To make sure people want to swap with you it is a good idea to list a number of books in a cross section of interests so they have plenty to choose from.<br><br>You or they can decline a swap if you don't fancy anything on their list of books.<br><br>I like the idea that I can be more efficient in managing my book collection using this website.<br><br>I'm afraid I don't know if they run them outside the UK - I am guessing people won't be keen to swap outside the UK due to the cost of postage of the books.</div>

<div class="content">Alison R,<br><br>Thanks for this reference, now I will have to find time to compile my list of books that I am prepared to "lose".  My interests are a bit focused, but maybe others are the same.<br><br>BTW, I think you meant ISBN, not ISPN.<br><br>Roger J</div>

<div class="content">I use www.paperbackswap.com which isn't a swap, but I prefer that it's not.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the recommendation Alison, I will give it a look. Having moved house in the last few months and being a confirmed book-a-hollic now with less book space, this could come in handy!</div>

<div class="content">I also have used bookmooch for a couple of years to give away and get loads of books for just the cost of postage. There are lots of UK users on there like me. I will check readitswapit too, thanks!</div>

<div class="content">Actually I like the idea of bookmooch as you earn points instead. so it is not essential that the person who has the book I wants one of the books I have!</div>
