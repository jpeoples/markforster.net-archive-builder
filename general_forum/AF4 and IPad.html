<div class="content">I have been successfully using a paper-based AF4 system for almost 12 months.  A couple of months ago I invested in an IPad and am now considering whether I should move to an electronic system which would be available on my IPad and my PC.  Any thoughts?</div>

<div class="content">I wouldn't recommend it until your paper-based system starts to fail you.  Don't let the tail wag the dog.<br><br>I do not use an iPad, so I am merely challenging your reason for wanting to change.<br><br>Perhaps there is a kick-ass iPad solution for AF4, but I think pen and paper are simpler than an iPad and do not require charging.<br><br>Did you have any iPad apps in mind?</div>

<div class="content">I own an iPad and I understand the ease you feel with the real estate that you have. I personally stayed analog with my system.</div>

<div class="content">You know, even though I have an iPhone, I still prefer to use my Hipster nano for taking notes on the road. I find it's easiest to enter stuff by computer. Second easiest with pen and  paper. These handheld devices aren't even close when it comes to quick task entry.<br><br>For reviewing notes, paper is easily best. An ipad would probably be great. Computers are fine but not very portable. iPhone is usable but limited by size. <br><br>Bottom line for me: use computer at work, and paper at home. An iPad might tempt me to switch but I think the interface would be to constraining for my comfort.</div>

<div class="content">Very interesting topic. This is question we are all thinking about since happened the Ipad. <br><br>I must admit : As I am always at my office and on the road too working everywhere and a lot too !, So I planned to buy an Ipad. It is so cute and easy. It's like a note book. And for others 3 reasons 1) Autofocus 4  2)showing my buildings to my clients. 3) Taking notes like on my other note book (the one reserved for notes)<br><br>But I was really upset about the cam (I like to tchat) and I finaly decided to wait for the new one, may be coming from the end of the year to the next quarter. <br><br>I finally decided to make a real test about the IPAD. As I could'nt borrow one, I went 3 or 4 time to the Fnac (retail store in Paris) and tried it a long time, each time. I was cool in my test because during the week it's is often quiet. <br><br>The result is amazing. Nothing worth paper !. A good spiral notebook for me is indeed much better than every digital solution. It's faster, it's easier and creative to collect my stuff and it's much better to read with my own writing. It is more adaptables, it is much better in the rush. and if you don't loose it it always works.  <br><br>I dont know what i will do in the future. For now i stopped trying experimenting and others methods than AF4. I don't use anything else but my paper spiral A4 notebook reserved for my tasks. <br><br>I am very happy with it. Of course I may change my mind when I will buy one, yes yes it will happen (lol), but for the moment i don't feel anu use of it and every time i tried to adapt AF4 on a digital solution even taskpaper wich was the best for me and Macintosh page  i lost a little of efficiency and feeling about things... <br><br>I may be of an other age... But I like it !</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the great feedback which broadly confirms what I was thinking -  if it's not broken don't fix it.  Had not thought about which IPad apps and if someone was using one that worked well I might re-consider!</div>

<div class="content">Hello John, I wondered when someone would bring in the iPad to this Forum!<br><br>I do not own any Apple products, but agree the iPad can come across as seductive.  I have used a Tablet computer since 2005, convertible Toshiba Portege M200 and M700 UK versions.  But I have not used in a lot in tablet mode because of the weight and hassle factor, battery life etc.<br><br>IF I wanted a slate like the iPad, it would be primarily for work, and AF4, and it would have integrate easily with my MS Office applications.<br><br>I think the iPad form factor is great, but I won;t buy one, nor even wait for the 7" or improved version.  I am working in Damascus and a Swiss colleague on a short term assignment bought an iPad in NY earlier this year.  Chris says he hardly gets to use it, but the iPad seems to stay mainly in the lounge/TV room where various family members use it.<br><br>What I AM interested in is the upcoming Fujitsu T580 convertible tablet which at 10.1" is netbook sized, Windows 7 and can handle handwriting ('touch screen' is not the same as handwriting!).  Its size lends itself to meetings, travel in cattle/coach class, restaurants etc and I can synchronise critical files (except Outlook, damn!) via Dropbox.<br><br>@Alan: is the 'Hipster nano' a phone brand or an old-fashioned notebook?  I agree at present with your sentiments about paper, using the ADOCs system notebook at present.</div>

<div class="content">I, on the other hand, am using my iPad - not for AF4, but for DWM.  Based on the recommendations of a number of folks here, I am using Toodledo (www.toodledo.com) in the cloud from my computer and with the app from the iPad.  It would work just as well without the cloud component.  And (having just refreshed myself on how AF4 works) it would be pretty easy to set the app up for AF4 as well.<br><br>There are pluses and minuses.  I am sometimes away from my list (I don't, for example, take the iPad to the grocery store with me), which I never was when I was analog - but because you can tweet to toodledo, I can add tasks via text message no matter what I'm doing (and if I'm away from the computer and the iPad, it's generally not a time when I would be working the list anyway, so all I REALLY need to be able to do is add tasks).  I like being able to add notes to tasks in Toodledo - not a lot, but enough to jog my memory about things.<br><br>It can work, but I would echo what others have said - if what you are doing is working for you, don't change just for the sake of changing.  I changed because I really liked DWM but from the very moment Mark laid it out, I wanted to do it digitally.  It was the first of Mark's systems that screamed DIGITAL at me.</div>

<div class="content">I have recenty bought an iPad*, and it has helped me with my AF4/DWM**. But it has not replaced my notebook; it has instead helped me cut down the time I spend mindless browsing the web. (Some random browsing leads to some serendipity finds, so I have not abstained completely :D).<br><br>I still sometimes got trapped into checking the news or Google Reader way too often, even inside my system. Now I do most of my reading on the iPad, including news, blog posts and scientific papers.<br><br>My workflow is the following. I have two actions on my list: "read links - delicious" and "iPad". The first one use to take an hour or two of hours everyday, scattered throughout the day, and I also had lots of pdfs/articles to print and read at my leisure. Now this takes 20 minutes at most --- I just read very short articles on the computer screen and mark everything to be read on the iPad. Usually in the evenings, when I sit down to read books, magazines and what the like, I also read most of today's articles on the iPad. It is much more comfortable than on the computer screen, and now I don't print all the things I used to. And I never read more papers than now.<br><br>But I don't think I would ever replace my AF/DWM notebook. Paper feels so much better.<br><br>* I wanted an e-reader especially for my papers in pdf. I wanted e-ink, but Kindle seemed way too complicated/locked. The iPad may be locked and all, but works wonderfully for my papers.<br><br>** I am using DWM. However, I have been at a work trip for a month, and I decided to use AF4 during the trip (starting afresh). When I am back home, I'll be back to DWM, also starting afresh. This has worked great, so far.</div>

<div class="content">@Roger.  The Hipster PDA was a joke that turned very serious.  You take index cards or folded paper, and use that instead of a digital device.  The Hipster Nano model is the same concept but business card sized.<br><br>Read about it here: <a href="http://lifehacker.com/tag/hipster-pda/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://lifehacker.com/tag/hipster-pda/</a></div>

<div class="content">@Alan: yes, I recognised the Hipster from the 'joke' but not the nano bit!<br><br>On the iPad/slate concept, I've decided what I would really like is the following:<br><br>- 10.5" screen with touch and PROPER handwriting capability like my Toshiba Portege M700 UK notebook.<br>- light a la iPad, NO keyboard but with Bluetooth and USB to add-on keyboard when wanted eg Matias folding keyboard, Stowaway similar, maybe a soft on-screen keyboard as well.<br>- Windows 7, so I can use MS Office and other applications.<br>- Camera, mic/headphone points for Skype calls, wi-fi, 3g card capability, GPS<br><br>Then I could use the slate as a screen in portrait or landscape mode and use a keyboard when time, space and requirements permit.</div>

<div class="content">My iPad has become my primary digital device. It almost replaced my computer entirely. I just wanted to say "because I hear that often" that I too work in a Microsoft environment but I never encountered real hard barriers to me using a Mac in those environments... I can save in word and excel even on the iPad and my presentations demolish the ones from the guys that use PowerPoint ;)<br><br>But please take his post very lightly, I don't want to start a label war!</div>

<div class="content">I have met my layer last week and i was astonished because he told me that now he could work only with the ipad. His main computer was just to do complicated thing but for the commpn use of everyday such as email notes, diary it was perfect. <br>Then I had another apointement with my client and when i arrived he had no computer at all on his desc but just the Ipad.... I asked if it was suffisant for him and he answered yes. <br><br>I begin to think that may be there is a revoution in the world business with the ipad. <br><br>Even if I prefer paper and like it very much i can 't stop thinking that may be i could adapt on my future ipad AF4 or DWM even if I prefer AF 1 or 4  LOL</div>

<div class="content">The BigGest problem with any digital approach is, too much flexibility. If you're the type who is always changing, always searching for better, digital media make this problem worse. <br> <br>In my case I have a very particular implementation in OneNote which largely ( but not entirely ) bypasses this problem.  Because my approach is very manual and very tied to the format of a OneNote notebook, which resembles a paper notebook, there's very little I can tweak. It workS for me because it is limited (follow the notebook format) yet flexible ( arrange the content freely within the framework). Evernote might fail me because it's too flexible. And more list-oriented programs cause me trouble because they're too constraining   But their automation has too many features.<br><br>The notebook format is best for reigning in unbridled creativity.  I don't think iPad has this.</div>
