<div class="content">Are you Primarily following the Dreams methods and using/building AF# as a secondary device?</div>

<div class="content">Ooohh, I've been so excited that Mark is working on AF5 and I've been trying to be like a good kid, not bugging Dad every 2 minutes asking "Are we there yet?". But every day I ask myself that and check the web site a few times to see if anything has been posted yet. <br><br>Mark, I've really not wanted to bug or pressure you... just recognize that there is a lot of quiet, behind the scenes suppressed excitement about whatever comes out of your fertile, creative mind next. We are respectfully waiting and I will try to keep doing it quietly after this lapse. :)</div>
