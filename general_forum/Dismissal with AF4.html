<div class="content">In Marks AF4 description he mentions that, when no item in the closedlist/backlog stands out they are ready for dismissal. If the items are not ready to re-enter or to delete, Mark suggests to: "it into a reminder system for review at a later date."<br><br>Why can't the items stay in the AF-list for a later review like in AF1?<br><br>Thanks, Jens</div>

<div class="content">Makes sense to me: make all those highlighted tasks on old pages your reminder system.  Of course a reminder system isn't complete unless there's something that reminds you to look at it.  When should you review those old tasks, and what will remind you to do that?</div>

<div class="content">I use a loose leaf setup for my AF4 list.  When my closed list is complete I move its pages to an archive binder.  I have a reminder in my tickler folder to review the dismissed items every month.</div>

<div class="content">The forced-consideration of dismissed items is one of the things I like best about AF4.<br><br>When I make that first pass through the highlighted items, I make a decision about them then and there.  There are three things that can happen to dismissed items:<br>1) they get re-entered.  In this case I follow the entry with an (r) just to remind myself that it has already been dismissed once.<br>2) they get entered either as dated reminders in my calendar for a time when I think I will be able to work on them OR transferred to a project list (I have lists for sewing/craft projects, possible topics for blog entries, home improvement projects, decluttering projects, etc.)<br>3) they get deleted.  deleted items DO occasionally get back into the list, but when they do it's because they've occurred to me again not because of any external reminder.</div>

<div class="content">I don't like keeping them in AF.  It starts to feel like a backlog.  I like putting it in the tickler (either Outlook tasks, or a paper tickler file) to be added to the list again at a future date, when hopefully I'll really have more time for it.</div>

<div class="content">I will try this:<br>To reduce rewriting task which are dismissed I leave them in the AF-list (highlighted) and put a reminder like "check dismissed items" on my tickler or (why not) on my AF-list.<br><br>Advantages: <br>+ no rewriting<br>+ all in one place<br>+ items can be changed to active only by turning some pages and reenter them to the open list.<br><br>I wonder which reason Mark has in mind, when he suggests to put items which you don't delete or reenter on an external medium (tickler, somedaylist, ...)...</div>

<div class="content">I don't see a problem with highlighting the "maybe"s in a different colour for occasional re review rather than deleting them outright. <br><br>You would want to put in a task to check them in the list or a diary (depending on how often you get to the deletion stage).</div>
