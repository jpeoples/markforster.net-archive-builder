<div class="content">Looking to recharge and rethink my annual goal planning, I thought I'd take a stab at Mark's "How to Make Your Dreams... ". I'm curious if any of you went beyond reading the book, and tackled the exercises? Also, are you able to maintain the Goal Achievement Method (+ journal exercises) in conjunction with AF/SAF, etc. <br><br>As an aside... I've been using a modified version of DWM with The Hit List for over a month. <br><br>Nice to be back.</div>

<div class="content">avrum, I read the _Dreams_ book, and the exercises are waiting in the queue for a "Current Initiative" slot.<br><br>That slot is currently taken up implementing various ideas from _Do_It_Tomorrow_, which have been going well. SuperFocus still runs the show, but for example I am handling yesterday's email today—only one day's worth of email each day—leading to less time spent on email.<br><br>If you feel up to sharing your experience with the _Dreams_ exercises, you can count me among your audience.</div>

<div class="content">Hi avrum,<br><br>I'm in the middle of reading it (actually more than halfway, about 30 pages to go), and I agree that it's very, very good. I've started some of the exercises also, but right now I'm stuck at the one about forgiving. I've put "work on vision" in my SF-list, so far that helps to get working on it about once or twice a week.<br><br>Thanks for bringing this up, good to hear others are working with it too!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Avrum,<br><br>I've thought about reading through first and then start the exercises, but knowing myself, I'd have more momentum with the exercises while still reading the book (the book is also very motivating to keep going with the exercises). I'll try to share here too, might make for an interesting discussion!</div>

<div class="content">I haven't read Dreams, but my experience with these sort of books is there's two approaches to reading:<br><br>a) Just read through it.  Ideas will be added to your way of thinking, that may over time possibly eventually affect how you live, think, act.<br>b) Read with specific intent to act.  As you read, consider whether you agree, disagree, or don't understand.  (If you don't understand, read on, review, reflect, search for clarity.)  Consider the implications, and how you can put the ideas into action.  In this case there's exercises presented, so study, choose, and do stuff.  <br><br>I'd say choose (b) if what you're reading looks to have a significant positive application for you.</div>

<div class="content">How would you answer the "what's better" question, if the question was phrased: "what went well today"? I'm wondering why Mark went with better, rather than "went well". As well, I'm wondering about... "better than WHAT?"</div>

<div class="content">avrum:<br><br>You're missing the point entirely. The aim of the "what's better?" question is to focus on growth. "What went well?" doesn't focus on growth.  "Well" doesn't imply growth - it could be an entirely static situation.<br><br>Better than what? Better than it was before obviously. The aim is to find something, however small, which is better in a situation. There's always something - even when everything else is a disaster.</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><br><<You're missing the point entirely.>><br><br>Perhaps. Though I'm still having trouble understanding how you differentiated between "well" and "better", particularly during the introduction of this idea (in your book). <br><br><<The aim of the "what's better?" question is to focus on growth>><br><br>I agree. But to do this, you need a starting point... something to compare progress to. In your book, you state: <br><br> "A good question to ask instead is, ‘What are the good things that happened today?’<br>An even better question is, ‘What was better about today?’<br><br>Again, better than what? You go on to give a few examples i.e. Had a brilliant idea for a new seminar,  of what went well with your day. I don't see how that is better than your previous day. <br><br>I'm wondering if things would be clearer, for me anyway, if I did the "better than..." exercise AFTER doing the GAM method. This would provide a reference point for an honest answer. Otherwise, as I've experienced the last two nights, I'm answering the question: "What went well with my day". Not bad, but I prefer your suggested question: "What went better..."</div>

<div class="content">Hi Avrum:<br><<Had a brilliant idea for a new seminar, of what went well with your day. I don't see how that is better than your previous day>><br><br>The previous day, there was no brilliant idea for a new seminar, which makes today better than yesterday. <br><br>I would've thought that what's better meant anything that made you feel good about your day, and not necessarily in relation to any previous point in time either. In fact, it could mean just feeling good about something in the here and now.</div>

<div class="content">JD - <br><br>I find these folks: <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://quantifiedself.com/</a> inspiring, in that they provide self-help/productivity efforts a degree of accountability and metrics. I think this helps avoid two things: <br><br>1. Delusional self i.e. Wow, I'm so much better than yesterday<br>2. Berating self i.e. Wow, I've done nothing since yesterday<br><br>I cycle everyday. I have no idea if I "did better" today than yesterday. To move from "what went well today" vs "what is better today", I think some form of metric would be helpful. <br><br><<In fact, it could mean just feeling good about something in the here and now. >><br><br>Which is fine. But, to my mind, that would answer: "What went well today..."</div>

<div class="content">To avoid this issue, when I designed DOIT, I tried to get people in the habit of measuring what is measurable.  So for instance if you goal is weight loss, it is easy less is better.  If your goal is exercise, more is usually better.  I walked for 20 minutes versus 15 minutes.  The better than concept is a great in the moment questions to use.  What is a better use of my time.  It is also a great feedback tool. what could I have done better to get a better outcome.  I am also enjoying the book.  Thanks<br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">@Mark - much appreciated. Thank you. I very much enjoyed this book. Actually, your approach to goal-setting (intuition, etc) is very much in tune with what Steven Pressfield is discussing in his new book: "Do the work". <br><br>@Gerry - I'm fine without specific metrics. However I found dong the "what's better..." exercise, BEFORE having any short/long term goals or vision, confusing. <br><br>This discussion has helped, thanks.</div>

<div class="meta">2011-05-4 16:58</div>
<div class="content">Gerry:<br><br>I agree that measuring what is measurable is a great tool. But it's not actually what this particular exercise is about. <br><br>The difference is that in the example you give you are measuring exercise results. To do this, you monitor how long you walked for (and/or other variables such as speed) on a daily basis. You may have other results you are monitoring but they are always specific.<br><br>Measurement of specifics like this is done in the "Current Situation" rather than in "What's Better?"<br><br>The aim of the "What's better?" list is to identify the growth points during the day, whatever they are.  Certainly you might include an exercise result in your in your list, but the majority of items on the list will be things that you didn't set out specifically to measure. <br><br>The theory behind it is that paying attention to problems tends to result in more problems, while paying attention to growth tends to result in more growth.</div>

<div class="content">"What's better" makes perfect sense to me.  For any particular item, you compare it to things you remember previously.  Every good new idea counts, because it adds to your idea collection.  If you fix your car, the car is better.  If you lost a pound, your physique is better.  If you discovered a great source for strawberry rhubarb pie, your knowledge of pies is better.<br><br>I suppose mostly you would focus on goal-related things and reflect on what things mean your goal is closer to becoming reality.</div>

<div class="content">Mark - what was your thinking vis-a-vis to-do lists... AF lists, etc, while writing this book? Throughout the book you mention using feelings/intuition as a guide to get the right things done. I don't recall any list being used. It sounds liberating. Was it? Were you employing a list, or system, while writing the book?</div>

No lists. No GTD.

<div class="content">I'm a fan of "Dreams" and still do the exercises frequently some 6 months after reading the book. The approach is more valuable to me when added to some NLP coaching questions/techniques eg What will be different when my goal is achieved? or What does my fear or my past say about this aim?<br><br>One character trait in myself that worked against me was that I wouldn't let myself feel fulfilled and satisfied until I'd achieved my goals. I have found I have to balance pursuing goals with taking breaks from striving /  achieving and wanting and move to a state of  relaxing into acceptance of life with its problems - and the realisation that things don't need me fixing them or making them right or better. I cannot always shape the world according to my liking with thinking, goals and willpower. Time for surrender and acceptance seem to unblock energy flows, a point Mark makes well in his book, in a different way.<br><br>One might say:<br><br>Goal: peace and fulfilment<br>Action: follow inspired action, without craving or longing or insisting things come in certain ways at certain times</div>

<div class="content">Sometimes. I think perhaps the answer is that we often act with a sense of  fear or tension or guilt. I would say we acting from a closed-up and compulsive part of us on those occasions.<br><br>Then again there are actions that feel open and relaxed. I would say the latter come from our "spirit" for want of a better word which you might see as having an overview of timings and events that our conscious ego has no access to. The key to doing what you "feel" like is developing the awareness to separate the two.</div>

<div class="content">avrum,<br><br>Having read your exchange with Mark above about the precise meaning of "what's better" and "compared to what?", I paid special attention to that exercise in the book (you might say, my mind filtered/homed in on it due to having already focused on it!). The word "growth" ended up standing out for me to make this idea concrete. I realize one might still say, "growth compared to what?" but for me the "growth" term feels easier to apply intuitively without getting bogged down in semantics. Simply: "what growth have you experienced today?" However, as I'm only about to start my *second* What's Better list, I am really not one to talk at this point (I haven't let it stop me, though!).<br><br>As for the self-coaching, I just made it through the Goal Ach. Method exercises today, so I have not started the actual dialog yet. I too feel a little "performance anxiety" about this, but I am hoping it won't feel much weirder than the talking to myself that I do anyway (aloud!) when I work out ideas.<br><br>From the rather naive perspective of Day Two, I can so far say this: today, I got done everything that mattered without really looking at the list I made last night or doing much SF scanning (even stayed caught up with my email without really noticing). I did use SF for most tasks, but I tended to write in C2 things that just came to me, mostly things that I know are on the list someplace and seemed to fit in nicely, while doing one or two semi-related C1's to turn pages. More importantly, I felt much more relaxed about getting everything done. Hmmm, there's one for the What's Better list!<br><br><<By the way - would anyone be interested in discussing the above info via Skype?>><br>Interesting idea, though I (still) don't Skype.

<div class="content">I've been doing the exercises for a few days as well. I've found the "What's Better" list very effective. I personally don't think it's overly "gooey" or happy-feely. I tend to think of it more "alright, quit your complaining, what's the solution?"<br><br>I've used the Goal Achievement method on a few tiny projects with success. One I wasn't motivated to do at all and the daily journaling allowed me to realize why. It's been subsumed into a "main goal" project (that I had found through the daily writing a few months ago).<br><br>I've been dialogging by talking to myself in the car during my commute. I've focused on the things that are going well, solutions, trying something different as opposed to the root issues of problems. It's also quite nice to affirm and expand what's going well with myself every morning before work.<br><br>Rewriting my vision has been exciting and entertaining. We'll see how it develops, since I've only started working on it.<br><br>I've been using SuperFocus exclusively for task management, so it's more that I'm using some techniques from "Dreams" rather than implementing it or a time management hybrid.</div>

<div class="content">I'm experimenting with a change to Mark's notion of current reality and future vision from "Dreams".<br><br>I'm wondering if the comparison of the 2 states would yield better results if the results of the comparison became activities in C1 intended to change patterns of thought or habits of behaviour or addition of new qualities of energy. My belief is that this encourages the process of clarifying perceptions on what is wanted and the gains that the desired "vision" state will bring, along with what expanded perspective and evolution of oneself will be required to bring clarity, and then "right action" in pursuing the right goals for the best reasons.<br><br>I also plan on allowing a symbol to come from the unconscious to represent the desired future state and bringing the energy of it into my energy field and then to my thoughts and emotions, prompting "right action".</div>

<div class="content">Well, it's time. After working on a short-term goal for 7 days (with moderate success), I'm curious to see how this process will work with an anxiety-producing 3-5 year goal (something(s) I don't have but want/need). I'm curious if I will be able to sustain the discipline and motivation past the honeymoon period (often a few days). I'm thinking this forum, and many of you, will aid my efforts. So thank you in advance.</div>

<div class="content">What my experiment yielded so far<br><br>Comparing current reality with vision highlights activity (=meaningful personal growth towards my personal ideals of who I could become), while still allowing actions generated from outer productivity and self-expression to be added to C1. C2 has become more inner focus on habits and attitudes to contemplate and/or visualise.</div>

<div class="content"><<I'm going to put the emphasis of my blog and newsletter onto "Dreams" for the time being.>><br><br>What excellent, timely news, Mark!<br><br>This morning, I reached the following passage, which is one of my favorites:<br><br>"With a clear overall vision there is often little need to set short-term goals. The problem with short-term goals is that they are often too prescriptive of how you are going to get to your vision. As soon as you start setting time targets and working out actions that need to be done by them you are committing yourself to a specific way of getting to where you want to be. You have ceased to allow your mind to be creative about achieving the goal."<br>(found under 27 August, section labeled "Short-term goals," p. 62 of 137 in my downloaded version)<br><br>If you are going to climb a mountain for two weeks, you will want to put a lot of planning into your gear and provisions, but you will not want to plan in advance where to place each footstep among the rocks on the trail. There is a right level of planning that takes place at the level of vision and tools and process, but not at the level of a step-by-step script. The script is rigid and fragile and will keep you spinning your wheels updating and researching whenever something changes. Ryan's "anti-fragility" topic at <a href="http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1497737" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.markforster.net/forum/post/1497737</a> relates to this.<br><br>It strikes me that _Dreams_ is about this right level of planning: how to think about it, how to do it, and how to keep it working. It feels like exactly what I need to pay attention to right now.</div>

<div class="content">In "Dreams", Mark suggests working on a small goal i.e. Email backlog, before tackling a large 3-5 year dream/goal. He also states: <br><br>"...to let things happen rather than make them happen. This means that we will be using the unconscious areas of our minds."<br><br>I didn't have much success with my short-term goal - create a nightly ritual - and I'm wondering if the power of Dreams is when it truly is a DREAM, rather than something we think we should do. <br><br>Curious what other think?</div>

<div class="content">Mark's suggested steps: <br><br>1. What is the goal?<br>2. How does the (insert short-term goal) make you feel? <br>3. Rephrase the goal so that it describes what you do want:<br>4. Place the goal in the present tense, and add feelings!<br>5. Now check that the emotions are ones which you do want, not ones which you don’t want. <br>6. That’s your goal drafted.<br><br>My short-term goal (Implementing a nightly ritual) had little to no feelings associated to it. I'm not so naive to think that changing a few words, or adding feelings, will magically create a PULL scenario... but I can't be too critical of these instructions if I haven't followed them. Ok, time for a re-draft.</div>

It's surprising how much you miss on first (or even second or third) reading.<br><br>Remember the real motivator is the gap between your Future Reality and your Present Reality. You have to keep your mind working on both. If you do this, your mind will automatically start to act as a filter to bring forward the actions which will make your Future Reality and your Present Reality coincide.<br><br>I give a simile in the book of its being like reading a map.

<div class="content">I have my own paraphrasing of Mark's processes which clarified things a little for me.<br><br>For me there are two possible starting points: "I want to get somewhere and my ego is driven to get there" or a more subtle and more important "something in my life is not right" (a vague discomfort, longing, want or heartfelt need). I say more important because these tend to be more heartfelt from my inner promptings than chasing head-based ego goals. <br><br>I then move to a "How can I be more aware of and fine-tune this perception?"<br><br>I start by putting words to the vagueness. I try out several ways of verbalising it to gain clarity. This can mean a growth in my way of seeing myself or my habits and patterns of thought. It's often growth that is more important than the outer goal-seeking which only brings a change of circumstance.<br><br>The process:<br><br>- What do I want AND what do I BELIEVE I will gain from getting it? How good are my beliefs about what will really bring me the quality of being I seek?<br><br>- What is my higher purpose? The desire that would bring most joyful self-expression of my talents? I use my imagination to bring forward a symbol to represent the energy of that purpose. I dialogue with it or draw it to see what it has to "say".<br><br>- What would I need to let go of or outgrow in order to pursue it?<br><br>- How is this furture me different?<br><br>- What activities arise from comparing Present Time with Highest and Best Future? How do I intend to get the outcome I seek?</div>

This probably means going direct to the overall vision and not testing out the system on single goals beforehand.<br><br>2) I would put more stress on how important it is to work with the Present and Future Realities - not just to re-read them regularly but to continually revise them.<br><br>3) In the book the main emphasis was on the dialoguing. I think now that the dialoguing is probably the least important part, and is also something which many people find quite difficult.

<div class="content"><<I usually do the Future and Current Realities first thing>> <br><br>Interesting. In Dreams, you suggested doing self-coaching 1st thing, and the Future/Current daily, moving to weekly. <br><br><<I think it's important though not to cut and paste the Future and Current Realities. I type them out afresh each time, amending them as I go>><br><br>Wow, you re-type your future reality afresh daily. My initial impression is: "That's a lot of work". But I'm going to try it.</div>

<div class="content">Mark - some questions regarding the future vision/goal. In Dreams, your future vision (opening scenario) is quite detailed, and fantastical. In your example above i.e. Day 1, your goal feels "very down to earth". I'm wondering if you're rethinking the fantastical for the more practical (I hope not - I really like the idea of jotting down a wild plan as fodder for the unconscious). Moreover, your currents suggestion (type your future/current realities afresh each day) sounds like it would work with Day 1, but would require more labor with your vision in Dreams. <br><br>Last question - did you (or your clients) encounter any superstitious stumbling blocks around stating things like: "My health will be better than ever..." or "My new baby girl is doing...". I did, and I'm not sure what to do about it. <br><br>Any thoughts on this matter would be appreciated.</div>

<div class="content">Wow, what excellent posts I have missed these past couple of days!<br><br><br>avrum:<br><<I've been conditioned to spend so much time on push, it's almost unbelievable that pull is possible. And yet, I have tasted pull once or twice, and would like this to happen more than once every 5 years or so.>><br><br>Amen! This is why I felt so tremendously excited the first time I read this book. Then, ironically, I said to myself, "I'll just start on this when I have a little more time ..."<br><br><br>Mark:<br><<I think the best thing for you to do is to keep working on the methods to the best of your understanding and at the same time keep re-reading the book. It's surprising how much you miss on first (or even second or third) reading.>><br><br>Yes, the second read has been very enlightening. I've ended up rereading certain pages many additional times, due to forgetting where I was, and there really are so many new connections to make each time ... this is truly a unique book in the genre. I can't help wondering whether the array of fluff that must have sat next to this book, in that section of the bookstore, limited its sales. If so, that is a shame.</div>

<div class="content"><<The reason I embarked on Do It Tomorrow, Autofocus, DWM, SF, etc. was because it's actually easier to teach a mechanical method. I was also very keen to find a mechanical method which used the power of the unconscious mind in the way that Dreams did.>><br><br>Mark, I was actually struck by this as I read _Dreams_ shortly after learning SFv3. Learning about Pull led me to see "standing out" as a filter for tasks where I felt that Pull. It was like cutting through all the visioning and dialoging and just going for whatever Pull was already there, latent, in the subconscious. Of course, this is more limited than the _Dreams_ method, because it means passively accepting whatever vision you have grown to accept at the moment, rather than working to shape your vision. But at least you get work in Pull mode, which is quite a lot of fun!<br><br>I have really enjoyed the vast majority of my SFv3 tasks, whether or not they were ultimately worth doing. I am convinced that SF will continue to be my way of reminding myself to do the little things while I am working on my _Dreams_ goals, doing both the little things and the big things in Pull mode, writing down only the things that I'd otherwise forget, in an extremely lightweight system ... isn't that the holy grail of time management?<br><br>We shall see whether SF fades away or not as I progress through the exercises.</div>

<div class="content"><re-type your future reality afresh daily.> <"That's a lot of work". ><br><br>Personally I journal a lot and believe writing out the vision is more visceral and engages more of who I am in the vision. It's also an act of loving kindness to myself to dedicate some time to what I want from living, or else what's the point of outer productivity when inner qualities come second. So it's not so much work as play or priority. For me the process has led to seeking the qualities in experiences - aceptance, tolerance, joy, patience, peace as "goals". It's the quality of being that is the real goal. The stuff is just the way to realise it or express it or allow it.</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br><<1) I think I need to encourage people to take the initial step of faith - acting according to their feelings - at an early stage. This probably means going direct to the overall vision and not testing out the system on single goals beforehand.>><br><br>I'll risk a bit more monotony by agreeing one last time tonight.  ;)<br><br>I dutifully constructed the small, short-term goal of setting up my desk for better productivity and ergonomics. My desk is actually so uncomfortable and stupidly arranged at the moment that I completely avoid it in favor of a really wonderful chair in the family room.<br><br>While this project was important to me and had been nagging me for a while, there were so many other bigger things popping into my mind as I read on, that it was hard to step back and get excited about a desk. I went many days not working on it at all, because I did not feel like it (though I continued rewriting the vision and Present Reality), and a few times I used the "I'll just get the folder out" technique, which is kind of a soft-peddled Push mode.<br><br>The past few days, I have been tempted to break the rules and skip ahead to the larger vision, so I will take your comment above as license to do so. I did make progress on the desk, just not a whole lot—though I hyped the heck out of it on my What's Better list!</div>

<div class="content">avrum:<br><br><< I'm wondering if you're rethinking the fantastical for the more practical (I hope not - I really like the idea of jotting down a wild plan as fodder for the unconscious). >><br><br>I'm not sure that it really matters where you start - with a huge fantastic vision which you then refine down - or with a narrow realistic vision which you then expand out. The important thing is that it ends up fitting you exactly.<br><br>When I wrote "Dreams" I was in a very different situation from what I am in now so it's not surprising that my vision is different. I think that the very detailed fantasy vision I gave then was in fact in the nature of the "Earn a million dollars" goal which I talk about in the book. A goal like that can become a burden until you work out why you want it. Once you've done that you can often achieve what you want more directly. That should all come out as you work on the vision.<br><br>As I said earlier one of the failings of the Dreams book was not to show more about the development of the Future Reality.</div>

<div class="content">avrum:<br><br><< did you (or your clients) encounter any superstitious stumbling blocks around stating things like: "My health will be better than ever..." or "My new baby girl is doing...".  >><br><br>Interesting question which I've never thought of before in quite those terms. <br><br>I think it's important not to include things over which one has no or little control. This is why in the book I advise against targeting people by name. So I said I have four clients paying me £1m a year, rather than I have celebrities X, X, X and X as my clients. It would also be a lot better to put "I have got married to a wonderful woman" rather than "Mary and I have got married", especially if Mary has shown no signs of being interested yet!<br><br>In the same way with health and family members we are talking about what we have control over. If your vision is giving you superstitious problems, that's probably because you are trying to use it as a lucky charm rather than as a spur to action. So you should take your superstitious feelings as a signal that you need to reword your vision.</div>

<div class="content">I thought it might be useful to post today's version of my Future Reality:<br><br>I am living a creative life in which the principles of "Dreams" are fully put into practice. Everything I set my hands to comes to fruition effortlessly. My life is so well-ordered that I am free to do what I want to do and create what I want to create. I feel boundlessly optimistic in a life that is spacious and full of energy. One of my best creations is that I am extremely healthy and fit. I attract people who share my enthusiasm for creation and this results in some amazing friendships.<br><br>Here's yesterday's for comparison:<br><br>I am living a creative life in which the principles of "Dreams" are successfully put into practice.

<div class="content"><<I thought it might be useful to post today's version of my Future Reality:>><br><br>Mark - a few days ago I asked about speaking (into a recorder) vs writing (as you've done) the future/present realities. I prefer to record these as I walk - though I'm not sure if I'm getting the full effect. Do you have any evidence to suggest that writing trumps recording the spoken word? Have you tried recording the audio? Curious.</div>

<div class="content">Bernie:<br><br><<The past few days, I have been tempted to break the rules and skip ahead to the larger vision,>><br><br>I worked on this yesterday. The hardest part - for me - was to get past the critical, perfectionist inner-voice proclaiming I'm doing this wrong... or that my vision isn't compelling. I did this by reminding myself that the daily updates will refine my future/present realities into something uniquely mine. <br><br>Because the material is too personal, I won't be posting it publicly. However I will provide updates.</div>

I hope though that you have one of those audio recorders on which you can date/tag the recordings because there are times when it's useful to go back and compare your Present Reality today with, say, a week or a month ago.<br><br>Also once your Future Reality has settled down for the time being, you might want to type it out and put it where you can see it while you work (probably better than playing it aloud to yourself on a continuous loop!)</div>

In "Dreams" I advised people who had difficulty deciding on a compelling vision to write two or more different happy endings and then choose one. And of course your novel will have some sequels!</div>
