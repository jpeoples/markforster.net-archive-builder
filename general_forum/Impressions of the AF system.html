<div class="content">I have now been trying the AF system since the first day of testing and I am filled with awe and amazement for how well it is working. By doing things “little and often” I have made strides on projects that had languished for months, if not longer. Many minor but still backlogged items have now been tackled and crossed off the list. <br><br>I am very trusting of the system and I’ve been able to key in to the tasks that “stand out” very easily. The more I use it, the more I am putting in smaller elements of tasks or projects which are working well. It is very easy to keep my lists going as tasks effortlessly appear on my radar. <br><br>I experienced some of what was discussed about lack of structure or no inherent “breaks”. I am now more aware of this and build in breaks or easier “fun” tasks. I am very grateful and excited to be working this method and I’ll check in every so often if I experience any new results. <br></div>
