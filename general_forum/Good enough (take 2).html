<div class="content">I wrote an essay, posted it here, but it didn't show. Trying again. <br><br>When you choose to work on something, how do you know when it's done? You're working on it because it stood out as important now, but there are other important things and this one may not have ultimate importance. You could work to get this 100% done but that may lead to running out of time for other important things. <br><br>Something like Paretos law applies here. Often you can achieve 80% quality in 1 hour, 90% in 2 hours, and 99.9% in a day. 80% isn't enough for some things so how do you decide when to quit?<br><br>Matt rEcently reminded us of the Value of the "little and often" strategy.  Work on a task until you want to move on to something else. This might be because you are weary, because you feel pulled to another task, or you aren't moving as fast anymore ( because you have finished the easier part.)<br><br>So you move  on doing a little of each valued work, and comeback to the first refreshed. Now you may feel ready to do more and you do it.  <br><br>Eventually you feel it's good enough for now. other things are more important. Congratulations! You have just determined that in your context, 80% quality is good enough for this task.  And you've saved 80% of your time. Put your saved time into something more valuable to you.</div>

<div class="content">Excellent post, Alan, as usual.<br><br>Part of my procrastination tendency is, I think, partly because what I do I think may not be good enough.  So I shy away because by not doing it, I might evade criticism of not being 'perfect'.<br><br>I have to say that I have been getting better at avoiding this trap and this is due to AF and its spin-offs of the last two years, and reading posts in this forum.<br><br>Twas a time when I would want to go introspective to find out 'why' and then cast about looking for magic fixes.  I've rationalised things a bit by accepting that maybe I've inherited the tendency from Mum who started playing the piano at 4 or 5, won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music in London before WW2.  Perfection was what she sought in everything, emphasised by her martinet teacher and my grandmother.<br><br>Mind you, she was bloody good in her day, and with failing eyesight and having celebrated her 95th birthday last month, can still put out Rachmaninov on the piano.  She's reluctant to tinkle the ivories now because she says she's not as good as she used to be, but she's got more talent today than those oxygen thieves than crop up on X-Factor these days.<br><br>Sorry, gone off-topic!</div>

<div class="content">I think for things where quality is a factor you are right. For things like writing a report or memo this holds true longer time may lead to a marginally better product.<br><br>For the issue of perfectionism a solution for some is to write task in a finishable manner. This gets you completing stuff. So learn the first 16 bars of a song will allow you to be as close to perfect as oppsed to practice song. <br><br>Gerry</div>

<div class="content">Hi Gerry,<br><br>>For the issue of perfectionism a solution for some is to write task in a finishable manner. This gets you completing stuff. So learn the first 16 bars of a song will allow you to be as close to perfect as oppsed to practice song. <<br><br>Little-and-often really helps me in exactly these situations. Here's what happens to me in the scenario you presented.<br><br>So, let's say I have a poorly written task called "practice song" (which is making me laugh hysterically, because in spite of my desire to do so, I can neither sing nor play an instrument).<br><br>There it sits in my list. After I have gone by it a few times, my intuition tells me, "there's something funky about that task that is keeping me from doing it. Time for a little bit of little-and-often work." <br><br>I then flag it and at some point during the day, I'm going to come to this task in my closed list of flagged tasks. I then think about it and I realize, this could be better written. So, I re-write the task at the end, but this time I re-word it better: "learn first 16 bars of song." I then take the flag off the "practice song" task, draw a line through it, and date it. Even though I didn't actually do any practicing of the song, as far as the task is concerned, I did do some work on the task – even though it was very little. (oh by the way, to the right of the newly written "practice 16 bars of song" task, I have written a 1 and the date to indicate that I have worked on this one time and the date I did so. I find that if I have already worked on something, then procrastination has been defeated on that task and I'm better able to get back to it.)<br><br>I find that if I start worrying about how to write down a task the first time I think of it, then I have some procrastination creeping in. So, I write it down, even poorly, because I know that I can always advance the task by writing it more clearly.<br><br>So, my use of the little-and-often principle also serves to provide some clarity.<br><br>Matt</div>

<div class="content">The degree of perfection required for any particular task is something that needs to be established at the start. Some things do require 100% perfection, and what's more should be pushing the definition of what 100% perfection is. If you are a concert pianist or a dancer or an airline pilot  then you can be content with nothing less.<br><br>Almost the opposite of the "good enough" principle is "overlearning", where you learn something so thoroughly that it becomes completely automatic. A good example is the way morse code operators were trained (yes, I am old enough to remember it!). Sooner or later, an operator would hit a wall beyond which they couldn't increase their speed. This was always caused by certain letters not being used quite as often as others, so they didn't get practised as often. The solution was to overlearn those letters by continually practising them and nothing else. Very boring work - but once those letters were overlearned the operator's speed would continue to increase again.</div>
