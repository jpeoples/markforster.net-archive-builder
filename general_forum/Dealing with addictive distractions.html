<div class="content">Ok, I'm a bit of a web/information junkie... gmail, facebook, twitter, markforster.net, diii.net, I check all of those several times a day for new information, status updates and what not. I.e. I am a product of the web generation.<br><br>Quite often, I will be looking at my AF list and my reactive brain will be telling myself "go check ... for news" and I'll be giving into it. I've tried adding some of those sites to my AF list, so I would be able to 'legally' check them when they come up in my AF list, but the urge is just too strong, so I often check them 'illegally' without them coming up in my AF list...<br><br>Any ideas on dealing with these kinds of addictive distractions?<br><br>By the way... I just ordered a bunch of Atoma notebooks which have movable pages (similar to the American Circa notebooks) in A6, A5, and A4 format, along with post-it flags (for Alan's project pages) and post-it arrows (for Matt's task flagging). I'm going to try paper and pen again... Wish me luck :).<br><br>The notebook with movable pages pretty much looks like this: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ducly/2247010172/sizes/z/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/ducly/2247010172/sizes/z/</a></div>

<div class="content">With SuperFocus, you should insist on writing down your activity before doing it.  This will be perfectly within the rules to do it immediately, and should help you become more aware of how much your distractions are killing your time.<br><br>With AF4R, same deal: Write on the active page, which you are usually already looking at, and proceed.<br><br>I honestly believe tracking your activity is a great way to realize what you are doing.<br>Also, remember the web is infinite.  You CANNOT finish that task.  Therefore you are 0% done, and if you check more often it's still 0%, and longer is still 0%.  <br><br>Follow the DIT strategy.  Whatever new stuff, mark it to read tomorrow. Tomorrow, read those, and if you find other interesting things, save for the next day.  When you feel an urge, pick only from your DIT list.  As you do, you find other stuff, flag it for tomorrow.  The following will happen:<br>a) You'll be starkly aware of how much surfing you're doing.<br>b) Some of yesterday's hot topics won't feel so hot, and you'll drop them<br>c)  When you find a link, you flag it Tomorrow.  If you find another link there, it will be followed the next day.  So instead of 100 pages in a session you read one or two.  The endless link following won't happen.  <br><br>re Atoma.  I've recently taken to a plain unzippered padfolio, without the pad. Inside I use neatly trimmed folders to group stuff, and a clipboard for the active pages.  Messier than the Atoma, but cheaper.</div>

<div class="content">Tijl:<br><br>You might try charging yourself a small amount every time you visit one of these sites. Don't see it as a fine, just a charge.<br><br>Put the money in a box, and when it's reached a reasonable amount give it to charity.</div>

<div class="content">+Ad Jesum Per Mariam+<br><br>O.o Who are you and why are you copying me? ^____^<br><br>Seriously I'm like you! Internet junkie here myself, with problems dealing with distractions.  My own solution to this dilemma is actually humility: I have to own up to the seriousness of my problem and deal according to the said seriousness.<br><br>First, ask yourself, has your problem grown to such an extent that you have to do what needs to be done? In my case, I have to be humble enough to acknowledge the seriousness of this problem and that I have to do some serious steps to solve it. I even took the trouble to write this acknowledgment and resolution in front of my AF notebook so that I can read it anytime and everytime I want to "distract" myself!  I would have to say that it was not for this first step the rest would have failed.<br><br>Once you have decided to deal with your distractions seriously, set up some time for yourself and get a pen and piece of paper.  Then list your distractions.  Next, try to group them.  For example, gmail, fanfiction.net, markforster.net --> Internet.  Mythbusters, Pawnstars --> TV.  Etc.  Then, try to rate each on a scale of 10, 10 being the worst.<br><br>Once you have the graded list of distractions, think of barriers for each group, starting with the least bothersome for the least serious distractions and getting more bothersome as you go to the more serious ones, and write them, then follow them.  I call barriers to be physical and social things that prevent or delay me from going to my distractions: for example, unplugging the TV, placing the computer in the living room instead of my room, etc.  I found that resolutions, scheduling, etc. by themselves will not work, because these rely on willpower alone, and unfortunately, by definition "addictions" are bad habits that willpower has little or no power over, and thus willpower needs help, in the form of other people and things in your way ^__^.<br><br>And when I say make these barriers bothersome, I do mean BOTHERSOME for the worst distractions.  For the computer (a laptop), I scheduled it to turn off after 10 minutes of idle time, have it ask for a password upon turning on, placed a timer beside me which I set to 15 minutes everytime I surf, and a Post It placed beside the monitor with a resolution in it: "Timer sounds or laptop off: turn off, unplug, pack in case, place in drawer."<br><br>Lastly, I made a Project File in my AF notebook: "Particular Examen of Conscience."  This was described by St. Ignatius Loyola, and is very practical.  The steps are (copied and pasted from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05675a.htm" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05675a.htm</a> ):<br><br>1) On rising in the morning we resolve to avoid a certain fault during the day, or to perform certain acts of particular virtue (in our case: avoid distractions)<br>2) About noon we consider how often we have committed that fault, or practiced that virtue; we mark the number in a booklet prepared for the purpose, and we renew our resolution for the rest of the day. <br>3) At night we examine and mark again, and make resolutions for the following day. We thus act like careful businessmen who watch for a while a special portion of their mercantile transactions to see where losses come in or where greater gain may be secured. <br>4) St. Ignatius further suggests that we impose upon ourselves some penance for every one of the faults committed and that we compare the numbers marked each time with those of the preceding day, the total sum at the end of the week with that of the preceding week, etc.<br><br>It may seem like a lot of work, but if we acknowledge that the problem is serious, then we will realize we need serious work to solve it, and we will find the strength to do it.  <br><br>God bless!</div>

The cover is genuine leather sewn over hard plastic.  Very solid, very sturdy, very professional looking.  I really like the pen holder built into it.  If you are near a Staples store, I highly recommend getting one and put the papers you will get from Atoma into it.  <br><br>The M Arc notebooks come in US letter size and half-letter size.  I am using this one: <a href="http://www.staples.com/M-by-Staples-Arc-Customizable-Leather-Notebook-System-Black-6-3-4/product_886234?cmArea=SEARCH" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.staples.com/M-by-Staples-Arc-Customizable-Leather-Notebook-System-Black-6-3-4/product_886234?cmArea=SEARCH</a><br><br>God bless!</div>

<div class="content">Regarding the ATOMA notebooks: I'm using them as well, but where do you get these nice covers from? Manufactum, my supplier, only have the plain ones...</div>

<div class="content">Christian, I assume you live in Germany. It seems that there is no other distributor in Germany of the Atoma notebooks. I therefore was in contact with Atoma in Belgium and ordered a number of notebooks and refills directly there (in particular, I like to have an A6 size notebook which seems not to be available at Manufactum). Disadvantage: Shipping costs 15 Euro. Look at www.atoma.be, they have different kinds of covers. <br>Wolfgang</div>
