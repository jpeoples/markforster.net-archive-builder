<div class="content">I recently came across a term I hadn't heard of before, though I knew of the principle. The term is "house blindness." This refers to the ability of your brain to overlook clutter in your house, so that you don't "see" it. <br><br>Your house-blindness is cured, whenever you learn someone is coming over. All of the sudden, you see everything.<br><br>I think we get that way with our tasks. I think that might be the genesis of the arbitrary dismissal rules. It is the jarring effect that cures your task-blindness.<br><br>I think that the little-and-often principle goes a long way toward keeping one from contracting task-blindness. We should probably rely more on the little-and-often principle than rely on the "shock" of dismissal.<br><br>Just a thought.<br><br>Matt</div>
