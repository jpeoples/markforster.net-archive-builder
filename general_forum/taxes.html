<div class="content">Odd as it sounds, I have been looking forward to getting my tax paperwork done. I knew it would take at least two days of dedicated work.<br><br>Yesterday, without looking at my AF list, the task to do the taxes "stood out"--in other words, I woke up saying "Today's the day I will do the taxes." I didn't look at my list for the rest of the day.<br><br>Today, I picked up the list, but still, I just wanted to get the taxes done, and realized I was just skimming the list, to look for "tax work".<br><br>Obviously, this is completely cheating the system. But how do handle such task that looms in your mind above all others?<br></div>

<div class="content">ds<br><br>I have found similar situations and what I do is add everthing I can think of related to that project on my last page, work as quickly as possible towards that page (as my reward!) actioning related tasks as part of that moving forward, and then working on that last page/s to completion.  It keeps the project within the system and means that by the time I reach the last page I have probably already actioned some of the tasks.<br><br>However at other times I have "just done it" and then enjoyed the fact that, on my next pass through the list, there are a lot of tasks that can just be crossed off as already done :-)</div>

<div class="content">ds, the same thing happened to me with taxes.  As soon as my son's last tax receipt came in the mail, I did his taxes - out of order on the list...  I think it has something to do with the fear of Big Brother... :-)  <br><br>I was following impulses to hop around my list too doing things I felt enthusiastic about doing, and Mark just said:<br><br>"If it works for you, then I'm not going to try to advise you out of it. I think we all (myself included) make exceptions at times. The real question though is what you do after you have made the exception. Do you go back to working systematically through the list, or does it throw you off for hours, days or even weeks? "<br><br>I was doing it a bit too much of this hopping around, so it did throw me off.  I started hopping around doing stuff off the list too, which led me to start a few projects that I didn't have time to finish - and my house got messier too.<br><br>I know, it's so hard to stop yourself from doing things sometimes when you're not used to being so enthusiastic to do them, you want to go with that mood.  Personally, I'd probably do it just to see what you learn.  It's not like the list won't be there waiting for you afterwards.  <br><br>Do you have so many pages that you can't just kind of work your way towards it, letting it pull you to get some other stuff done before you tackle it?  I've done that before.<br></div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the quick replies! I think Mark's advice will serve me well. Assuming I jump right back to my system after the Big Task, all will fall back into place and I'll have had the fun of getting a big task done while I was excited to do it.<br><br>(Note: "fun" is a relative term; we are talking about taxes after all...)</div>

<div class="content">ds:<br><br>My previous advice quoted by Jacqueline still applies. But I just want to sound a note of caution about leaping ahead to the Big Task. This is that if you'd waited until the task came up anyway, you would have probably had even more impetus to get the task done. The danger is that once you start "hopping" you will start to do it more and more often as Jacqueline found.</div>

<div class="content">Mark's right - I have to "curb my enthusiasm" (they named a TV show after me!) because I tend to start too many things without finishing - the lure of the new.  :-(</div>

<div class="content">I have to say that, although it has been remarkably easy to incorporate my backlog projects into AF the fact is that I have had to do that because they reached the "have to be done" stage.  The fact that I am now at a stage of genuinely addressing those backlog issues is in itself a testament to AF but the fact that I need to do it regardless does mean that I still have a degree of resistance which requires some extra discipline.  I am so looking forward to getting to the stage where I can really focus on the current .....</div>
