<div class="content">You know what....I have decided to come back.  I think I do have some insights about time management that may be helpful and therefore I will continue to post.  But mostly, I can learn so much from others here and I need the interaction.<br><br>I have been to two funerals in two days....and now life goes on.  So, I hope it does not disappoint anyone, but....I am back.<br><br>Best wishes,<br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Hi David,<br><br>I did not comment before now because I was sure you'd be back.<br><br>I'm happy you've gotten past the worst of it.  Gad, two funerals in two days.  I mean, how depressing is that!<br><br>I do like hearing what you have to say.  It always has been helpful to me.</div>
