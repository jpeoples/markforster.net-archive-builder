<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-01-10 17:50</div>
<div class="content">First of all: Mark, your approach to time management is the best I know. <br><br>When I first tried to adopt a time management system, alll I knew was that it should be an easy system, so that I avoid procrastinating within the system itself (as I did with David Allen's approach) and that it should rely on scientific knowledge so that it would really work. <br><br>I've read a lot of scientific studies about time management and came to the conclusion that the best way to handle my daily tasks and to avoid procrastination (which means to me: not doing something instead of something, but doing something and painfully regretting not doing something else) is to incorporate ideas that have been used in cognitive behavioural therapy and in neuroscience, such as improving the executive function of the brain and to balance the rational and intuitive parts of the brain. And then I read about DIT and it really incorporated these ideas. I read the book and decided to give it a go and it worked smoothly!<br><br>Now, you said that you think that the autofocus system is a major improvement over DIT so I decided to have a crack at it, too. After 5 days of testing I can say that it's not really much better than DIT - just a bit different:<br><br>- the idea of "structured procrastination" is stretched to the limits in AF (which is much  better than in DIT), but unfortunately at the expense of the idea of getting a day's workload done in one day. I miss the good feeling I had after having done my workload for the day. Now I really don't know when to call it a day.<br><br>- by doing my "current initiative" in DIT I was sure that I got around to do at least something meaningful that day, with AF I can't be that sure. Structured procrastination means that I get things done - but maybe just minor things. I'm a lazy person and the things that "stand out" for me when going through the list are often things that are easy or fun to do. In other words: My rational and intuitive parts of the brain are not in balance at all! My intuitive parts often win over my rational parts and I end up doing busy work instead of meaningful work. <br><br>- DIT was just one list in your daily planner: I got used to split my pages in half. The left side for deadlines, appointments etc. and the right side for my tasks (including the current initiative). Everything was there at a glance. AF is unfortunately one list + plus a daily planner, because I can't write down things that has to be done at a specific time. <br><br>If there was an easy way to incorporate the idea of structured procrastination in the DIT-system, it would be perfect for me. Unfortunately it seems that AF doesn't balances both parts of my brain at all. It seems that I actually start to what I call "procrastinate within the system" by unconsciously picking up items on my AF-list that are easy to do while I dismiss others. It's definately not a matter of how I write things down (e.g. "start outline" vs. "write article") because it worked perfectly in DIT.<br><br>Thanks for your work Mark!<br><br>P.S.: In case some sentences are pretty awkward: I'm not a native speaker - have mercy on me!</div>

<div class="content">M. Romer,<br><br>Why are you dismissing things? <br><br>I would dismiss something because, with the benefit of hindsight, I thought it was trivial. Sometimes, in the heat of the moment, I decide I have to do something silly. If I write it down, and then come back to it 4 days later, I might dismiss it. But I wouldn't dismiss an item that I recognize is important to my long-term well-being, like filing my taxes.<br><br>I am planning on giving AF at least another full week. But it seems possible to create a hybrid AF. You could have two lists. One list is the standard AF list. The second list would contain recurrent, time-specific, and day-specific tasks. Essentially, there would be a mandatory list and a discretionary list. Checking in-boxes (physical and virtual) could go in mandatory. Serious work and procrastinating activities would go in discretionary. <br><br>AF consists of multiple closed lists (each page being a closed list). Hybrid AF would allow us to work off of two sets of closed lists simultaneously.<br><br>As I said, I don't plan on testing this hybrid. At least not for another week. But if you are ready to abandon AF, you might want to try something like this first.<br><br>Good luck,<br><br>moises</div>

<div class="content">@moises:<br><br>Thanks for your answer moises!<br><br> I dismiss things because they are NOT trivial. That's my problem. If I go through the tasks without a preoccupied mind until something stands out for me, my subconscious (intuitive part of the brain) picks the easy task. With AF I would never do my taxes, but instead buy milk, clean my car and read some essay I meant to read for a decade. With DIT I put the taxes as a current intitative on my list and give it a go - little and often - until I finish my unpleasant task. <br><br>In a way DIT's task diary already is a kind of shorter AF-list. You can't make much use of structured procrastination because there are only a handful of tasks on that closed list, but I procrastinate less and have the feeling of really getting some important things done.<br><br>The hybrid is a good idea. I'll look into that before abandon AF completely. Thanks for that...<br></div>

So you leave it on the page, eventually it becomes the only task left so you have to do a little bit of it before crossing it off and re-entering it on the last page.  Then you have to do a bit more of it when you get to that page and all the easier tasks on the page are done - and so on.<br><br>AF, done according to the rules, will force you to do a hard task little and often.<br></div>

<div class="content">Interesting thread - I've been thinking along similar lines to Moises. I had an idea of using AF within the DIT current initiative concept. But first I am going to persevere for another week or so before deciding. I like your descriptions of 'mandatory' and 'discretionary' list.</div>

<div class="content">M. Romer:<br><br>Are you sure you are doing the system right? I am a bit worried when you say:<br><br>"I'm a lazy person and the things that "stand out" for me when going through the list are often things that are easy or fun to do. In other words: My rational and intuitive parts of the brain are not in balance at all! My intuitive parts often win over my rational parts and I end up doing busy work instead of meaningful work."<br><br>Autofocus consists of a series of closed lists which are repeatedly passed through. So it is entirely possible to do the easy tasks the first time you come to a page, but on subsequent visits to a page all the easy items have already been done so you don't have that choice.</div>

<div class="content">@Annette:<br>Sure, I will eventually do my taxes - but with DIT I put it on my current initiative and feeling better immediately because I just know it's getting done. It's not that I don't "trust" the AF-system, but it takes much longer to do the unpleasant tasks and tasks become more important over time. I'm always in the risk of fire-fighting.<br><br>Besides: It's not that I think AF is a poor idea - it's way better than many time management systems out there - it's just not an improvement for me compared to DIT. <br></div>

<div class="content">@Mark Forster: <br>Thanks for the answer. I think I got the system right. When I have no choice I will eventually do the unpleasant tasks - but it takes much longer than putting them on my current initative and get the thing going the next day. And there is the risk of procrasting with other stuff that is not on the list, because the list contains only unpleasant items. I never had that feeling with DIT.</div>

<div class="content">I meant of course that I got my taxes done *last* year. In fact I had the tax return in two months after the 07/08 tax year ended in April. Like Christine I've always previously had a panic session in January!</div>

<div class="content">I've decided to try the Autofocus system for another week or two AND planning a DIT-like Current Initative that helps me overcome procrastination. Thanks for the discussion so far in this thread. It helped me to make up my mind about the system...</div>

<div class="meta">2009-01-11 21:27</div>
<div class="content">The relative disadvantage I found with the 'Current Initiative' was that it was essentially a queue of items and I would often feel frustrated about doing each in turn and how long it might get to the last one. Also I might not have been in the correct context to move the initiative forward (environment and time) .This is not a problem with AF, which I like becasue I can start working through problems / tasks early and my mind gets a chance. I have found this feature helpful up to now.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark and everyone else, <br><br>First of all Mark, thanks for your continued innovation in Time Management and putting your new system out for everyone, free of charge. <br><br>I'd like to feedback that I prefer DIT over AF and that I will be continuing with DIT. The main reason for me is that DIT has worked extremely well for me over the last 12 months or so since ditching GTD. A key problem for me is that AF is just to open ended (yes I know it still has closed lists!) and at the end of the day this is too much of a worry for me. Conversely, I believe I have gained a good reputation within my organization and with my clients as somebody who follows through quickly and reliably with the things that are my responsibility to do. The value of this to me is too great to risk and I really do feel that a problem with AF is that there is the possibility of missing or procrastinating over tasks that simply have to get done. Also I like to have a plan for my day and I do not believe AF offers this. <br><br>The beta test has been useful because it has helped me realize the value DIT has for me in my current job role. Moreover I have taken a closer look at the 'Current Initiative' and I believe that I have incorporated a more intuitive and flexible approach to it. <br><br>Thanks again.</div>

<div class="content">@Leon:<br>The "Current Initiative" is not a queue of items for me. Mostly I use it to kick off a project or an unpleasant task. The problem with these tasks is that I still feel (not frustration but) resistance to do them - and therefore start to procrastinate on them when using AF. In DIT they have their fixed time slot and get done. Maybe its part of my personality that I need this strict rule, I don't know...<br><br>I think you are completely right concerning the closed lists. AF is 'a bit more open' if there is something like this. And I miss the feeling of having achieved the work for the day. <br><br>Nevertheless, AF seems to get more tasks done for most people out there. Maybe you should give it a go and try it for at least a week. <br><br></div>

<div class="content">Leon, I think it is perfectly sensible for you to continue with DIT if you feel it is working wonders for you. A time management system should be all about helping you to achieve your goals, not a plaything to spend your time with. Some people seem to forget that at times... If you have found something that suits you well, then stick with it.<br><br>DIT has some advantages over AF, as you have higlighted, like being able to plan your day and knowing when you are done. It is a superb system and I was skeptical about changing it at first. But then I realised that AF with employing "little and often" succeded in getting me forward with projects I had been procrastinating with. However, each individual has his preferences, strengths and weaknesses, and different systems suit for different people.<br><br>It is wonderful to know two effective yet simple systems to manage your workload!</div>

<div class="content">At length, and after working with AF1 and AF2 I also return to DIT.<br><br>We are all different and our challenges and approaches are different.  For me in AF it is too easy to add things (no measured committment), to hard to release things, and the list gets longer over time.<br><br>With DIT I do have focus and control, and for manic periods or unusual workloads I can decalre Backlog and / or use Current Initiative to manage the overflow or lumpier projects without ending up with a list I can no longer eyeball to work.<br><br>Thanks for all the insights ~ much apprecaited Mike<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Because I have so many pleasant activities on my list, the concept of being relieved at being done with it is foreign to me. The one thing I do for big deadlined projects (like taxes) is to add them to a program called DoThisFirst that tells me how much time I need to spend on it each day to be done in plenty of time. I then write "DoThisFirst" on my AF list and do it whenever it stands out. You could do this with a current initiative list as well. <br><br>One problem I think people have with AF is thinking that they will forever do the "less important" things. I see this like being on a free diet. Yes, at first you will O.D. on desserts. But if you stick it out long enough, you'll get really sick of sweets and you'll go for the meat.</div>

<div class="content">Learning as I go, Benjamin Disraeli said it better than I can:<br><br>"Never apologize for showing feeling. When you do so, you apologize for the truth." <br><br>And Teddy Roosevelt puts my thoughts into words even better:<br><br>“It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly; who errs and comes short again and again; because there is not effort without error and shortcomings; but who does actually strive to do the deed; who knows the great enthusiasm, the great devotion, who spends himself in a worthy cause, who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst, if he fails, at least he fails while daring greatly. So that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.”<br><br>Thank you for your posts (caps and all)!!
