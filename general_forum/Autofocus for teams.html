<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-04-8 22:07</div>
<div class="content">Mark said something in the "when is a system a system" thread that triggered several ideas to pop into my head.<br><br>He said:  "My experience, both with myself and with the hundreds of people I've coached over the years on time management, is that you can have all the project planning methods you like but they don't actually help much in getting the project done. (I'm talking here about getting your stuff done as an individual - not coordinating the activities of a number of people which obviously does require planning.)"<br><br>The idea popped into my head that you could coordinate a project team with Autofocus, as follows.  <br><br>First, just create a common Autofocus notebook for the project team.  (It would probably need to be an online/virtual notebook, so everyone could access it, unless you all happen to sit next to each other or something.)  <br><br>On your personal Autofocus list, you'd have an entry "Work on Project X".<br><br>And when that item stands out for you, you'd go take a look at the Project X Team Autofocus Notebook.  You'd work through it following the usual Autofocus method, with the following clarifications / elaborations.<br><br>There are two approaches that popped into my head:  (1) everyone has the same current page or (2) everyone has his/her own current page.<br><br>(1) Everyone has the same current page:  With this approach, let's say the current page is Page 3.  When you come to the book, you look at Page 3, and find some task that "stands out".  If nothing stands out, dismiss whatever remains, and move to Page 4.  OK, you find something on Page 4, claim the task, and start getting to work.<br><br>Someone else comes along.  The Current Page is now Page 4, so that's where they start (even if the last time they were here, it was still on Page 2).  <br><br>If anyone comes up with a new task (or partially completes an old task), they add it to the Last Page, as usual.  Anyone can add new tasks.<br><br>If you look at a page, and nothing stands out for you, but there are several tasks there that really must be done by a different team member, then maybe you should take a look at those more carefully.  Maybe send off an email, "What's the status of Item A?".  Or maybe, "How can I help you with Item B?"  Or maybe, "I'm wondering if it's OK to dismiss Item C".  That email moves the task forward, so you count it as completed, and rewrite it at the end of the list.<br><br>(2) Everyone has his/her own current page.  If last time you visited the project, you were working on Page 2, then you start back at Page 2.  If Page 2 has already been completed / dismissed by others, then just move forward to the first active page, and start working there.  Otherwise the same as (1).<br><br><br>Then, in your weekly project team meetings, you could: <br>+ review what work was done<br>+ review what new tasks were added<br>+ review what tasks were dismissed<br>+ look at what's getting done, what's moving along the easiest, and consider why<br>+ look at what tasks are being avoided, and why<br>+ look at dismissed tasks, and decide what to do about them <br>+ maybe dismissed tasks aren't important<br>+ maybe dismissed tasks indicate a resource problem (need more people!)<br>+ review any pertinent deadlines, and make sure they are addressed in the AF list<br><br><br>I'd bet this approach would a lot more effective than the way most projects are run nowadays, using the project-management-system-du-jour.  You'd stay focused on what's really important, have an excellent way to identify and discuss problems, etc.<br><br>You could also start immediately on any project of any complexity, and like Mark described in that other thread RE building a new house, you could probably avoid most top-down planning altogether.<br><br>You could even avoid defining the project, if you aren't ready to fully articulate it yet.  At some point you will probably need to cast your project in terms of "MBO" objective, or a "quarterly target", or a "management initiative", or some other way to communicate what you're doing to your stakeholders and management.  <br><br>But maybe at the beginning, you just have a vague problem statement, and no real idea of a solution or how to even define the problem.  With this approach, you could just start with that, ask a few people to get going on it, start up a new "notebook", and see what happens.<br><br>Might make a great Web 2.0 application, for any of you programmers out there.</div>

<div class="content">Would an item only be dismissed if ALL team members marked it as dismissed?<br><br>re Web 2.0 app - I'm a web programmer and that was the first thing that popped into my head, before I reached the end of your post :)</div>

<div class="content">I was thinking that an item would be dismissed by ANYONE, just as though it were that person's personal AF book.  It doesn't require a team consensus or anything.  <br><br>That is, I come to a new page.  Nothing stands out.  I dismiss everything on that page, and move to the next page.  I don't know (or need to know) who else has already looked at that page.  Reasons for the dismissal (i.e., lack of standing out) can be discussed with the team at a regular team meeting.<br><br>If I'm afraid of dismissing "someone else's" task, I can send an email: "Hey you, what's up with Task A?", which actions the task, moves it forward to the last page, and prevents it from being dismissed.</div>

<div class="content">Hmm maybe I need a more concrete example. Here is what I'm thinking applied to my team specifically: <br><br>I work on a development team, and we are at the bug-fixing stage of our product. If we do as you say and list all these bugs on a page, the problem would be depending on what area of the product the bug is related the to, different tasks would stand out for different team members. So it seems it would be too easy to dismiss a task that someone else should really be working on, if a task was able to be dismissed by one person.<br><br>Sorry for picking on this one point, I think the idea has a lot of potential! I think regular team meetings (like daily ones)/good communication amongst team members would be essential to this system working.</div>

<div class="content">I tried this with my sons when She Who Must Be Obeyed took a week in Foreign Parts recently. Our Bumper Book Of Things To Do was a standard A4 notebook which sits on the kitchen table. I guess this counts as an upgrade to Kitchen Table 2.0.<br><br>- a current page bookmark for each of us<br>- when someone took on a task they booked it with their initials<br>- some tasks were tagged to individuals: Ollie doesn't get to do James' revision for example<br>- When nothing stands out for a team member, they sign off the top of the page. when everyone signs off the page we dismiss the remaining tasks<br>- When Ollie signs off a page that still has "clean the bathroom" open, we have a little chat about objectives and commitment. This addresses Sabrina's point, I think.<br>- People are allowed to jump out of sequence for certain tasks:<br>   +- ablutions<br>   +- feeding pets<br>   +- ...<br>   +- but they don't move their bookmark mark when they do this<br>- certain tasks get a time limit (an early tweak...)<br>   +- MSN<br>   +- Playstation<br><br>Everyone had their own piece of paper folded to A7 to note new thoughts that occur to them<br><br>It worked reasonably well. <br>- Quite a lot of the items on each page were tagged to individuals: I'm planning to change to reviewing two page spreads<br>- Handwriting practice all round: trying to make out other people's illegible scrawls does get in the way<br>- some felt that it was a pain having to come back to the kitchen between minor tasks<br><br>Now that SWMBO is back, we seem to have less discretionary time. I need to think about whether to carry on with it...</div>

<div class="content">Back in a business context:<br><br>Web 2.0 application<br>------------------------<br>Andreas Would it be a reasonable tweak to add multi users and multiple page signoffs, or would this mean a rewrite of the existing schema?<br><br>Paper implementation<br>-------------------------<br>I can see this working well in a physical war room:<br>One flip chart per page say 10 - 20 pages blu-tacked to one wall of a conference room<br>Probably each individual would accumulate  of thoughts and add them to the wall at intervals.<br>A marker for each person showing which page they're on<br>A room brimming with energy as everyone dashes backwards and forwards adding and closing tasks<br><br>I'm feeling energised just thinking about it ...</div>

<div class="content">Will:<br><br>Are you talking to me? I didn't participate in this thread before so I'm a little surprised. If you meant autofocus.cc, in it's current form it would need a mayor rewrite because there are a lot of hardcoded per list settings, i.e. current page, that would need to be taken out and embedded in a user-list relationship.<br><br>Seeing as I am currently rewriting a lot, I'll look into accommodating something like this, but I am behind as it is (I kind of have a full plate at the moment - I have to write my thesis and am in rehab from my spinal injury). So it could take a while.</div>

<div class="content">Andreas,<br><br>With apologies to all the other fine Andreases out there, when it  comes to Autofocus web applications, there can be only one Andreas. And you are he.<br><br>I haven't been following the site recently and I can see that you have a lot on. In your position, frankly, this would not be my top priority. Anyway, thanks for answering my question so quickly and clearly.<br><br>So, all you Ace Ajax Bodgers out there, the field is open to you!<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Will</div>

<div class="content">Oh, well, there's always working on autofocus.cc as procrastination. ;-)<br><br>Today I've been doodling about redesigning the database scheme. The currently online version has a "user" table and a "tasks" table. Tasks belong to a certain user. The user table contains all settings and stats, i.e. items per page, current page, layout settings etc.<br><br>When I first started the redesign, I wanted to make multiple lists per user possible. This meant one more table called "lists". Each list belongs to one user. Now there is not one "curent page" property anymore, there's one for each list. So the per list settings needed to be moved from the user table to the list table. Easy peasy.<br><br>Today I tried to find the best structure to make teamwork possible. That means a m:n relationship between users and lists, so I need one more table, which I called "user_list_correlations" for now. That table holds pairs of user_ids and list_ids, to connect multiple users with multiple lists.Now it gets interesting. If all users should always be one the same page, the "current page" setting can stay in the list table, but if every user should be able to move through the list independently, that setting needs to go in the correlations table. <br><br>So we now have user-specific settings, list-specific settings and user-and-list-specific settings. Question is: which should go where? What would you want autofocus.cc to work like in team mode?<br><br>My current thoughts: <br><br>- Every user can mark a task as "currently working on", others can see that he is working on it.<br><br>- Adding the info WHO added, did or dismissed a task.<br><br>- I think independent moving through the pages for each user is better, so everyone has his/her own current page.<br><br>- I thought about dismissing tasks only for the user who dismissed them, so others - who may think differently about them - can still work with them. But that would complicate matters even more. Perhaps global dismissing and later discussion is the solution to go here.</div>

<div class="content">Also, the setting "items per page" should be list-specific, I think. I could let everyone choose how many items per page he wants, but it may facilitate communication if you can refer to "the third task on page nine". What do you think?</div>
