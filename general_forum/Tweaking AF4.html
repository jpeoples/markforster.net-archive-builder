<div class="content">As I am unable to remember where I left off on the list yesterday, let alone what stage of the cycle I am on, I have found it necessary to start at a fixed spot each morning instead.<br><br>I chose the beginning of the Open List, because it has the additional advantage that the urgent things will be dealt with early in the day, but without getting stuck in the Urgent, like in AF2 and AF4. It also ensures that the Open List is looked at at least once per day.<br><br>Does anyone think this will affect the balance of AF4?<br><br>Any other tweaks to share, anybody?</div>

<div class="content">Ditto - and not just where I left off the day before.</div>

<div class="content">Wooba:<br><br>There are really two questions in your post:<br><br>1) How to remember where you left off on the list yesterday.<br><br>2) Whether starting each day at the beginning of the Open List will affect the balance of the system.<br><br>In answer to Q1, my own method is not to close the last item I was working on, so that there is still a dot next to an undeleted task.<br><br>The answer to Q2 is that it probably doesn't make too much difference. But keep a watch out that you are not using it to procrastinate over tasks in the Closed List.</div>

<div class="content">I do the same to make sure urgent item will get noticed early - but I only scan it for REALLY urgent items (and not items which stands out at the moment) and then continue with the item I left off yesterday (I also use the dot - as suggested by mark).<br><br>In addtion: If the items are urgent when I enter them in my AF-list (some will get urgent later ;-) I put an exclamation mark at the beginning of the task - thus the urgent items stands out while scanning the list.</div>

<div class="content">I use a physical marker for my current task - I have a paperclip that I place on the edge of the page to mark what I'm doing and I just leave it in place when I step away from the list.  When I come back, it's very obvious where I left off.<br><br>My one "tweak" if you want to call it that has been that I do sit down and skim the entire list at the beginning of the day, just to "prime" my subconscious.</div>

<div class="content">As has been said in other strands, I'm a big fan of going with the rules first.  And I'm finding AF4 really excellent, having followed the process through the previous incarnations.  Only two little tweaks so far, one of which I see Mark does himself.<br>1.  Leaving the current task open with its identifying dot, even when completed, until the next task is begun.  That way you always know where you were last time you were in the list.<br>2.  Leaving highlighted tasks not crossed out unless they are rejected completely or re-entered.  This makes it easy to look back and see the tasks which were never done as a Someday list.  In this way I can continue to 'throw everything' at the list without mental editing.  If something is a bit blue sky, it will just become a highlighted item which will come up when 'Review highlights' is actioned.<br><br>With these tweaks, I'm finding AF4 effortless, it's just how I live.  I'm on the list all the time that I'm actively doing stuff (I don't bother to put 'veg out in front of telly' but I could), my hopeless memory can relax, and stuff I'm trying to avoid gets done.  Thanks, Mark.</div>

<div class="content">I've been thinking about Mark's reply to Wooba, where he said it probably wouldn't make much difference if you started at the beginning of the Open List at the beginning of every day.<br><br>For me personally, I am pretty sure it would make a BIG difference, and it would be negative.  Sometimes on "urgent" days, I can stay in the Open List all day long.  Work for a time on a task without completing it, cross it off and add it to the end, move to the next task.  After working in this way for awhile, come towards the end of the Open List, where I put in those tasks that I re-entered.  Work on them again the same way.  Spend the whole day chasing the end of the Open List, but never reaching it... <br><br>When I'm dealing with many urgent tasks, that's how the whole day goes.  And it's right and proper that it does so -- they are really urgent, pressing tasks, and it's important that I stay focused on them.<br><br>At the end of the day, I keep my marker on the task I finished with, and pick up there again the next day.<br><br>In the back of my mind, I always know that if I skip a task on the Open List, it could be quite some time before I get back to it again.  I might not see it again AT ALL that day, or even for SEVERAL days, if I need to keep working the Open List like I described above.  This forces me to keep taking "little and often" actions and keep moving all those items forward.  I really hesitate before skipping anything.  The result is that I stay very focused and productive.<br><br>If I knew I would be starting at the beginning of the Open List every day, I'd have a much greater tendency to skip over some Open List items and move on down the list, maybe even getting back into the Closed List, since I know I'll see those items again pretty quickly -- no later than the beginning of the next day.  <br><br>Maybe that's OK.  <br><br>But my main point is that the dynamic is quite different.  For me at least, it would be a very big difference, and would probably leave me feeling unfocused and scattered.<br><br>However, I might be a special case, since my list tends to be very long.  If you are able to keep your list short and cycle through both Open and Closed Lists several times a day, Mark's suggestion wouldn't have nearly the same impact as it would for me.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br>Obviously the way the list works for each individual is going to vary according to their circumstances.<br><br>But the way I envisaged the list working (and the way it does work for me) is that one moves through both the closed list and the open list quite fast. Getting stuck in either part of the list is not how I saw it working.</div>

<div class="content">One thing I find fascinating about the discussions here is how people with different personalities and working styles use Mark's various systems.  In this case, I wonder how much of this depends on how you define "little and often"...  Maybe Mark's definition of "little" is smaller than Seraphim's?</div>

<div class="content">In general, when I read comments about people never reaching a certain part of their list, I believe there is a good chance they are not fully grasping the "feels ready to be done" concept.  For me, there is a big difference between "feels ready to be done" and "can't think of a good reason NOT to start this task."<br><br>If you're facing a long list and tend toward the latter, you will likely get bogged down in tasks that may not have "felt ready" to do, but you couldn't bring yourself to skip over them because you couldn't find a reason to.<br><br>Just a general comment after reading these discussions for several months.</div>

<div class="content">Brian, good observation! I also sometimes do tasks because of "why not"... And sometimes I do tasks just to finish the closed list...<br><br>But does this really cause problems? If I know that some urgent tasks are waiting at the end of my list, the answer to "Why not?" will in most cases be "Because there is this urgent task at the end of the list". And if I have nothing urgent I can just "drift along" my tasklist...</div>

<div class="content">One thing I have found myself doing occasionally is going to the Open list before a complete pass of the Closed list without finding something that stands out.  Part of the problem was starting with a long Closed list (15 pages/150 tasks) when I switched to AF4.  <br><br>Because of the way it happened, it isn't cheating much (but cheating really is binary; either you cheated or didn't).  I have only done this after several passes through the Closed list where I had done something each time.  I felt I needed to get to things on the Open list and didn't want to risk getting bogged down on the closed list.   <br><br>So far AF4 has been working very  well for me.  But I am surprised that my lists have remained constant in overall size.  The page count has gone from 14-16 (with AF1-AF3) up to 16-20 with AF4.  But the number of tasks seems pretty steady at 145-160.  Best of all, I am getting a lot done,  big an little, important and not, urgent and not, mostly on-time, without feeling stressed or wondering what I am missing.</div>

<div class="content">Here's my AF4 "tweak."<br><br>Each morning when I open my list I write the task "Leave for the day" at the end of the open list. Then, AF4 as per instructions but "Leave for the Day." will be the last thing I do. That means I must go through the full list at least once (though I always end up with multiple cycles) and whenever I start the day I am in the open list (because of "Leave for the Day") so I will be able to work on any urgent tasks from the previous day first.</div>

<div class="content">I was also constantly losing my place (not just at the end of the day), in both AF3 (RAF) and AF4. I was using a post-it tab, but moving it about all the time was tedious.  Like Mark, I put a dot on the current item, but since I'm left-handed, I strike through the completed item from right to left, landing my pen on the dot. <br><br>To keep your place, Mark suggested: <<my own method is not to close the last item I was working on, so that there is still a dot next to an undeleted task.>><br><br>I've modified this method a bit, since I really like to strike through each task when it's done. I now leave a small gap between the dot and the line. I can then take a break, or close the book, and always know where I left off. Then when I scan the list and place a new dot on the next task, I go back and close the gap on the previous task. (If I forget to close the gap, I'll see the dot next to the stricken task, and close the gap when I come back around to it.)<br><br>The hardest thing now is to remember to leave that little gap next to the dot, if I'm not sure I'm immediately ready to place a new dot on the next task.<br><br>Hope someone else likes this little tweak.</div>

<div class="content">Ubi<br><br>I'm doing the same. Except in addition to the dot, I am writing the day of the month to the left of the dot. That seems to make the dot stand out more, and helps track how long it takes to get things done.</div>
