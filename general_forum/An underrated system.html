<div class="content">So, during the last few weeks, I've taken a break from any long lists. I've been trying out "no-list" systems, which are something new to me. I've always been more attracted to the long list, and, previously, I've never really given "no-list" systems their due.<br><br>I'm convinced now that "no-list" is a valid way of working (though very different than the long list). Certainly, "no-list" is a valid alternative to using no list at all which is my usual fallback when taking a break from time management.<br><br>So, which "no-list" system is the best? I don't purport to have the answer to this question after a short trial, but so far, the most effective for me has been the "Simplest Form of No-List" which is just writing down the next thing you're going to do before doing it. The essential thinking behind the system is explained more fully in the instructions here: <a href="../general_forum/Full List of Official No-List Systems.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://markforster.squarespace.com/forum/post/2612782</a><br><br>This system involves a paradigm shift. Unlike almost all of Mark's systems (including the other no-list systems), there is no gap between your writing a task and doing it. There is no buildup of tasks "to do" at some point in the future (or perhaps never). There are obvious pros and cons to this approach but overall the effect is interesting. The system feels very low maintenance and there is little resistance. I wonder what it would be like for someone to use this system long-term. (Probably, it's suited more towards certain occupations than others.)<br><br>Anyway, my point here is not to mount some extended argument in favour of "The Simplest Form of No-List." I merely want to share my suspicion that the system is probably underrated. Mark has so many systems it's easy for some to get overlooked. I think in this case it's also easy to read a description of the system and to think "That's too simple to work" or "How is that better than using no list at all?" But the simplest ideas are often the best. (Just think of Simple Scanning.) <br><br>I imagine that the "Simplest Form of No-List" would be good for people who have been struggling sticking with a system.</div>

<div class="content">5T is my favorite no list, unless you consider the "willpower" exercise as a no list system, which works well for me on days where willpower is needed.</div>

<div class="content">The first No List system, the one where you just note down the time and the task you are now going to do, was introduced in Mark's first book "Get Everything Done." It was called "Time Journal" in that book.<br><br>The 5/2 (Mark renamed it recently thus) system was introduced in his most recent book "Secrets of Productive People." With it Mark also explained the purpose, the conceptual framework of No List systems.<br><br>The idea is to develop routines and keep at them. What for?<br><br>The underlying premise is that consistent, focused, attention over a sufficiently long streaks of time is the way to success.<br><br>We achieve this, by establishing routines and keeping at them.</div>
