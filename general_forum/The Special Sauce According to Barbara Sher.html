<div class="content">Ms. Sher recently posted this on her Facebook page: <br><br>"But I want you to know that most dreams are not impossible. We’ve just been brainwashed into thinking they are. A few limits to possibility are in the human body. A few. The rest are in the mind, and those can be changed. <br><br>Don't do it yourself. Isolation is the dreamkiller. Positive thinking not required. Don't worry about your attitude. The secret is support, encouragement, information, and help."<br><br>So many of my projects/dreams have been launched in isolation. I need to make this (Jewish) New Year's theme about collaboration and support (even if I have to pay for it!).</div>

<div class="content">Personally I have always found that the way to achieve something original is to keep talking about it all the time to anyone who will listen. All the things she mentions in that quote happen virtually automatically if you do that.</div>

<div class="content">John Maxwell says your best ideas are always better when shared, because regardless of your own skills, others provide complementary perspectives that make your better. Random idea, leagues away from my own experience:<br><br>Have a dream party. Besides food, People should bring their dreams. Your job is to encourage and support them. Perhaps some will bethought to do the same for you.</div>

<div class="content"><<that the way to achieve something original is to keep talking about it all the time to anyone who will listen.>><br><br>I'm in the process of working on a graphic novel. I do not have an art background, and very rudimentary drawing skills. Without getting into too many details, the drawing process has been very frustrating, I don't need more lists or hacks, I need accountability and encouragement. How do I know this? Because those elements were present for all of my band's CD releases, the creation and opening of my private practice, and soundtrack work I've done for film. <br><br>As an aside, I've always felt that the Wishcraft process would be enhanced by any of your methods.</div>

<div class="content">Alan:<br><br><<Perhaps some will bethought to do the same for you. >><br><br>I'm hoping :) I've been unsuccessful (to date) in hiring a private (comic drawing) tutor. All the classes are either geared towards children, or offered at night (when I see families).</div>

Matt has a large amount of instructional material and keeps the site wildly current. I think he's taking a week off for vacation then he's going to post 21 day process for learning how to draw.</div>

<div class="content">Avrum, I have a friend in your neighbourhood* who's striving to become a graphic novel artist.  He could point you to some local sources for support.  <br><br>(*Well Barrie is sort of your neighbourhood)</div>

<div class="content">Mark - 100%<br><br>If I started thanking you for all that this site has provided me, I'd crash your server. <br><br>In other news, I've been using DWM (my favorite system) for a whopping 3 days. Nice to be DWM'ing again.</div>
