<h2>Original Post</h2>
<div class="meta">2011-02-12 6:55</div>
<div class="content">Mark seems to have posted somewhat-conflicting rules about dismissal in the new SF3 system. He writes: "2. When you visit a page which is full (i.e. has no space left in Column 2), all tasks on that page must be either actioned or dismissed." This rule implies that one may choose NOT to action one or more of the unfinished tasks in Column 2, but rather dismiss them.<br><br>But in the very next paragraph, he writes: "Dismissal only applies to tasks in Column 1. Tasks in Column 2 must always be actioned." This stronger statement is consistent with the earlier rule that you are stuck on the current page until Column 2 is all crossed out.<br><br>I'm a bit confused here. I see the need to deal with the full-2nd-column condition when you come to it, since otherwise one would have to put newly urgent tasks somewhere else. But this where-to-put-urgent-tasks issue will still come up if one decides to slog through all the remaining tasks in Column 1 instead of dismissing them. It could also happen if there are several unfinished tasks that take a while to action.<br><br>Perhaps the dismissal rule should be rewritten thus: "When you visit a page which is full (no empty lines in Column 2), or on which no tasks in Column 1 stand out, all remaining tasks in Column 1 are dismissed. You still must action all the remaining tasks in Column 2 before proceeding to the next page, of course."<br><br>What do y'all think?</div>

<div class="content">I think it's the same but clearer.</div>

<div class="content">Ubi<br><br>Your rule sounds like the rule for any page you come to. You always have to action all items in column two and work at least one item in column one. The question of whether any task stands out or not does not matter. They all have to be actioned.I think Mark wants to treat this situation differently.<br><br>Maybe it could be like this.<br>"When you visit a page which if full (no empty lines in column 2) all remaining items in column 1 must be actioned or dismissed. All items in column 2 must be actioned as usual."<br><br>The last clause would only come up, I think, if you had just added some unfinished items from the previous page and they filled column 2.</div>
