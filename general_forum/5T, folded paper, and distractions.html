<div class="content">I have a pile of paper printed on only one side -- drafts, misprints, extra pages, etc. I take a sheet, fold it in quarters into a little booklet, and make the top square my 5T list. When I need a dynamic list, I open the booklet, label a square with the project name, and brainstorm what I think needs doing. <br><br>Today, I have two dynamic lists going. The 5T will refer to "Seattle" (tasks to prep for this trip) or "Office" (a list of things to tidy up in my home office); I turn to those tasks' respective dynamic lists inside the booklet and check off tasks as I do them for as long as I feel like working on that project. When I'm done, I close the paper booklet and return to the 5T list. <br><br>After that, it's just following the 5T rules. Anything of note I needed to write down (I called a rental car agency for price info) I will transfer to Evernote. At the end of the day, toss, recycle, or shred the paper. <br><br>One thing I continue to struggle with is tasking my distractions and amusements. I wrote down "Chrome" to give me permission to read and close open browser tabs until I feel I've delayed my life long enough to actually get to a real work task. I write down "Gmail" and "Kindle book." But still -- they don't feel like proper tasks even though I spend time and energy on them. But that's my thing. I'm experimenting today with just writing down on the 5T any distraction I think of when it's time to add new tasks. Having to be very clear in the moment about what I want to accomplish with the next 3 tasks forces me to be specific about how I want to spend my time.<br><br>I also am doing something someone on the forum described. If I find I've mindlessly surfed or moved all my desktop icons 2cm to the left as a procrastination strategy, then I write that down on the 5T, draw a box, and check it. This helps me see how where my time goes, interruptions, etc. (My usual 5T tasks simply have an underline by them that I check off.)</div>

<div class="content">Thank you for the inspiration Mike Brown! I know of a way of folding and cutting a letter-sized paper into a 16-paged mini-pamphlet, each page sized 1/8th of the paper.  That should give me 2 pages for my 5Ux, and 14 pages for my possible dynamic lists.  Good thing I write small!</div>

<div class="content">nuntym - Are you talking about this?<br><br><a href="http://www.pocketmod.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.pocketmod.com/</a><br><br>I am using that too.  :-)</div>

<div class="content">Nope, something else :-) That way of pamphlet making is too inefficient with the given sheet of paper, making only 8 pages, while how I make my own makes me a pamphlet of 16 pages of the same size as in "pocketmod".</div>

<div class="content">Whatever nuntym's secret is, I really like having a reason to use a PocketMod again.  Any kind of PocketMod always seems to keep things fresh and current -- small, light, tactile, visual.   That little sheet of paper gets USED.   I don't pre-print anything -- I just use the folding technique on any scrap of appropriately-sized paper.   It's a perfect fit for 5T + Dynamic Lists.</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br>I tried using PocketMod once or twice, but it always seemed to end up as a rumpled greyish neglected piece of paper which I usually found in the pocket of a jacket I hadn't worn for ages.</div>

<div class="content">Mark - Funny you should say that!   I was using a PocketMod for 2-3 days, but then went back to my pocket Moleskine for nearly the same reason.   The PocketMod just kept getting lost in my pocket!    And I couldn't attach my pen to it!   But I actually *like* the rumpled greyish effect -- the thing is getting USED.   But I am getting that effect with my Moleskine, too.  :-)</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br>It's not the rumpled greyish effect that is the problem, but the neglected state of it - which means it _isn't_ being used.</div>

<div class="content">It is like an accordion style notebook that you can make from a single sheet of paper. I actually have been scratching my head on how to show you guys how to do it, it was something I found out accidentally by myself and I cannot find a similar way of doing things online. I don't have a decent camera setup either.<br><br>I'll think of something.</div>
