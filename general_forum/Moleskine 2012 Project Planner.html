<h2>Original Post</h2>

<div class="content"><a href="http://www.moleskineus.com/mb512pr-moleskine-2012-project-planner.html" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.moleskineus.com/mb512pr-moleskine-2012-project-planner.html</a><br><br>Yesterday I bought the Moleskine 2012 Project Planner. It fits in one's pocket.   The dates of each month are on the top and are visible for 2 pages.  There are 11 horizontal sections.  The pages fold out so that the entire year, day by day, month by month can be seen, on one big page.  I have never seen this before.  On the other side, each month is on one page, with the days of the month listed from top to bottom. <br>I bought it, and now I am wondering how to use it.  Has anyone used this?  Any ideas?  I have thought of putting a checkmark in the box for the day when I do an item, and keep track, such as habits I want to maintain or start.  I don't have an idea how to use it with projects. <br><br>Mark H.</div>

<div class="content">Mark H. <br><br>I'm smiling while reading your post. I've done similar things with journals, software... get home and wonder: "Er, now what?". <br><br>I'm diggin' your suggestion of using this as a habit/project tracker. The format of this journal will make weekly/monthly/yearly reviews quite helpful.</div>

<div class="content">Might be useful for a Gantt-chart view of a project.   But does anyone do those on paper anymore?</div>

<div class="content">markhedm - <br><br>Just purchased the Project Planner. I've been using an iPhone app to track habits, etc, but the stats/graph scheme is underwhelming. I can think of a number of things I'd like to track:<br><br>* meditation<br>* how many times I "touched" an important project (per week... month, etc)<br><br>as well as using a data rating scheme for mood, sleep, etc. <br><br>Using a multi-colored pen (each color representing a project, habit etc), the end result could be a nice looking art/journal project. <br><br>Thanks for sharing this.</div>

<div class="content">It should be  something that will last the whole year to take advantage of the whole year perspective by each day. <br>How would one track meditation?  That is one of my activities. <br>I play piano, and I could track what pieces I am working on. <br>Or I could set some goals for the year, and track those.  How minutes I spend each day. <br><br>Mark</div>

<div class="content"><<How would one track meditation?>><br><br>Let's say meditation = red pen, on each day/square i'd put the total # of min meditation.</div>
