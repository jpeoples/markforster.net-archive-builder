<div class="content">As I mentioned after the DO IT Beta Test I am going to be working on some other projects.  I am not sure what I will be doing with the Simple Time Management site.  It may be nothing or it may be seminars, coaching  or consulting, I will have to see.  <br><br>In the interim, I have put links to all of the ebooks including DO IT on the website.  They are direct links to the PDF files, so you are free to download them at no cost.  You do not need to pay, sign up for anything or leave an email.<br><br>If anyone is interested in discussing these methods, I may use the yahoo group created for the Beta Test as there are some helpful posts there already.  Please let me know and I can post the link to the group.  I hope the ebooks have been and will be useful.<br><br>Thanks<br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div>

<div class="content">I checked them all last night and they seemed to work.  I will check again this evening.  Unfortunately, the blogger platform does not allow you to host pdf files, so I have to use other sites.<br><br>Thanks<br>Gerry<br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div>
