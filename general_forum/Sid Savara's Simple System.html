<div class="content">Hm.  Maybe everybody was scared by the look of that link.<br><br>Here's what Sid wrote:<br>"   1. Do Something That Matters. <br>   2. If You’re Motivated –  Keep working.<br>   3. If You’re Tired - Take a break.<br>   4. When You’re Satisfied – You’re done for the day!<br>...<br>Sometimes we overcomplicate things, and need to just get back to the basics.<br>"<br><br>I find it's helpful sometimes to think simple like this.</div>

<div class="content">Alan,<br><br>Thanks for the summary.<br><br>It wasn't the link that scared me, but the pop up sales pitch before I even got to the website.  Very offputting.  But I'll take another look - I am struggling with motivation at the moment.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Alan ... for the original link AND for your follow-up summary! which made me click on the link !  :o)  VERY worth it ! loved the simple diagram and the simple "instructions." Very helpful, actually. As you say, sometimes it is helpful just to be reminded of the basic basics, in a very simple way!! I really appreciate your sharing this resource. Thanks again. - Bev</div>

<div class="content">I actually skipped through Sid's site (it was a bit gaudy for me) and click on the The Dojo link at the bottom, reading that now will let you know what I think.<br><br>G</div>

<div class="content">I think Sid's site does a nice job of discussing how time management and goal achievement are connected.  Good time management does not necessarily mean you are achieving your life goals and bad time management does not mean you are not.  In fact, many bad time managers get to their goals faster because they ignore the mundane stuff and/or are bad time managers. <br><br>I am curious if anyone signs up for the Dojo if they will post a review?<br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://www.simple-time-management.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.simple-time-management.com</a></div>

<div class="content">Alan,<br><br>Here's a less scary link to the same site to use in future:<br><br><a href="http://shrinkster.com/1e06" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://shrinkster.com/1e06</a></div>

<div class="content">My $.02 on the Dojo Guide - bear in mind I haven't bought it and I won't be either.  The two guys behind it are Charley Gilkey from www.productiveflourishing.com and Jonathan Mead from www.illuminatedmind.net.  <br><br>Charlie Gilkey is an extremely sharp young guy and his site is really great.  It used to be easier to navigate, but if you surf it by categories you can get the gist of his style.  He has a background in philosophy (I think he has his doctorate in philosophy), and it shows in his writing.<br><br>Jonathan is a ~24 y.o. rebel type of guy.   His writing is very inspiring I would imagine to some of that age group who has the wanting to break free of the corporate grind mentality.  I'm not sure how his methods - whatever they are - would work for someone who doesn't have a similar mindset. <br><br>My guess is that the guide would be along the lines of inspirational (ie. do what you love talk) rather than time management prescriptive.  I could be wrong though.  <br><br>They have a money back guarantee I think though and Charlie is a super guy and would definitely honor it.  I wouldn't hesitate to get the materials in the knowledge that you could return them if it wasn't up your alley.</div>

<div class="content">I didn't click on that scary link. But Bev's recommendation moved me. Anyway, it turns out all those scary bits after the "?" are not necessary. This unscary link is all you need ...<br><a href="http://sidsavara.com/personal-productivity/ultimate-productivity-system" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://sidsavara.com/personal-productivity/ultimate-productivity-system</a><br> ;-)</div>
