<div class="content">My latest challenge:<br><br>Now I'm on Twitter I want to describe AF in one tweet of *exactly* 140 characters. Anyone like to have a go? <br><br>The tweet must be self-contained (in other words it must include something on the lines of "AF is..." or "To work AF, you..."<br><br>I will use the best ones. Unfortunately there won't be room for an attribution in the tweet itself, but I'll acknowledge the ones I use here.</div>

<div class="content">Not an answer to the above but is anyone else having difficulty accessing the RSS Feed to the AF Tweet?</div>

<div class="content">Mark, How about:<br>"AF captures possible actions on a single list, and your rational brain and intuition work in harmony to achieve what's important to you now."</div>

<div class="content">How about<br><br>AF eliminates procrastination - you work from task lists but in such a way that you do what you want, when you want - and get things done!</div>

<div class="content">oops missed a bit - should read <br><br>"AF eliminates procrastination - you work from task lists but, in such a way, that you do what you want, when you want - and get things done!"</div>

<div class="content">Christine:<br><br>Come off it - you can't make up the tweet to the right length by inserting random commas! :-)<br><br>The correct punctuation would be:<br><br>AF eliminates procrastination - you work from task lists, but in such a way that you do what you want, when you want - and get things done!<br><br>1 character missing!</div>

<div class="content">Christine:<br><br>I've posted it as:<br><br>AF eliminates procrastination - you work from task lists, but in such a way that you do what you want, when you want - and still do the lot!</div>

<div class="content">Random commas indeed! Huh! You try counting letters and spaces at nearly midnight!  Now how sad was I?  :-)<br><br>Thanks for the amendment! :-)</div>

<div class="content">You do know that the Word word count will count characters with spaces, don't you?? :-P</div>

<div class="content">Ah, but that would have meant opening Word  ............ (actually I've never really needed to bother with word count - I only used it for probably only the second or third time a week or so ago, out of my curiosity arising from the "writers" thread) :-)  They say you learn something new every day - I am learning a lot today!</div>

<div class="content">Re 140 chars in Twitter: It's actually best to shoot for ~120 chars or less, as this allows space for easy retweeting. RTing is the ultimate Twitter compliment, and is the viral mechanism by which your following grows.<br><br>With 140 chars, a peep has to edit your tweet in order to RT it.<br><br>- @AmpleAliveness<br>(Just starting AF today.)</div>

<div class="content">Another TwitterTip:<br>Instead of using "AF" use either or both "@AutofocusTM" and/or "#Autofocus" (without quotes).<br><br>Including @AutofocusTM creates a clickable link that takes readers directly to Mark's Twitter bio or Twitter page (depending on what Twitter application they're using) where they can learn about him & Autofocus and follow him.<br><br>Including #Autofocus will allow searching specific to Mark's system. <br>Searching on "autofocus" without the # brings up Mark's stuff, along with lots of photographic stuff. (Searching on AF brings up lots of junk.)<br>#autofocus is thus far unused -- so let's grab it for this system. I especially encourage Mark to use it as part of every tweet.<br><br>Here's what I just tweeted:<br>Experimenting with Mark Forster's new @AutofocusTM time-and-task management system that balances intuitive & systemic approaches. #autofocus<br><br>@AmpleAliveness</div>

<div class="content">Anne:<br><br>Thanks very much for those tips. It's only Day 2 for me on Twitter so I'm still learning what the buttons do!<br><br>What is retweeting?</div>
<h2>Reply by Anne</h2>
<div class="meta">2009-02-11 23:17</div>
<div class="content">Retweeting is when you repeat someone else's tweet for the benefit of your own followers. <br><br>Example:<br>1) Mark tweets:<br>    "My new Autofocus system will boost your fun and your productivity. #Autofocus"<br>2) I might retweet:<br>    "RT @AutofocusTM My new Autofocus system will boost your fun and your productivity. #Autofocus <-- try it, it works!"<br><br>(If there were space, I might also add a link to your AF instructions page.)<br>(Mark, I strongly suggest you add that page as your "more info URL" on your Twitter profile.)<br><br>A retweet begins w/ RT, then the twittername of the person you're retweeting, then all or part of their tweet, then if you want, add <-- (or such) and your own comment. All in 140 chars -- hence the value of shorter initial tweets!<br><br>Some of the more popular Twitter applications have one-click retweeting, but the native Twitter page does not. (I use TweetDeck, for many reasons, including this.)<br><br>Hope this helps more than it confuses, Mark. There is a learning curve to Twitter but IMO it's worth it for fun and wonderful connections.
