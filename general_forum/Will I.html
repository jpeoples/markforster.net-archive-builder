<div class="content">I am following DWM as is since it was released. My first reaction was "nothing can ever be better to me than AF4", but of course I did not listen to it --- that had also been my first reaction when I was using DIT and AF1 was announced. DWM has worked great for me, and (or because?) I just use it day in day out. As my notebook is about to finish, I am eager to start fresh with a new one. I think I like mass dismissals as well as minor day dismissals.<br><br>However, as I feel a bit sluggish, I tried the "Will I?" trick today (see below). It worked. I intend to keep this frame of mind. :)<br><br>The "trick" is briefly described on this article:<br><br><a href="http://scienceblogs.com/cortex/2010/07/will_i.php" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://scienceblogs.com/cortex/2010/07/will_i.php</a><br><br>An excerpt:<br><br>"But that's not what happened. It turned out that that the "Will I?" group solved nearly 25 percent more anagrams. When people asked themselves a question - Can I do this? - they became more motivated to actually do it, which allowed them to solve more puzzles. This suggests that the Nike slogan should be "Just do it?" and not "Just do it"."<br><br>By the way, I really enjoy Jonah Lehrer's blog. I am a lurker in this forum, by the way, not a ad-bot. :)</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Natalia. Very interesting post. Will I do it ? i indeed easy to think and do. I am going to try may be it will help me to struggle against proscratrination. And it is simple.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the link, Natalia.  Very interesting article.<br><br>Maybe this idea of 'intrinsic motivation' is the reason why so many of us find AF and DWM more effective than traditional systems.  There's been quite a lot of discussion on this forum about resistance.  Some people have mentioned that they tend to rebel against doing anything they've been told to do.  There is much less resistance with AF, because working the list is more like making a series of choices than following a set of orders.  So it could be said that the AF method indirectly elicits intrinsic motivation.  Mark has always been clear that AF is not a 'To Do' list, but perhaps we should now call it a 'Will I?' list?</div>

<div class="content">By the way, I would never have thought you were an ad-bot!  Didn't you post some AF pictures  on Flickr, long long ago? I really liked them!</div>

<div class="content">Thanks,  and here's another good article, this one on visualisation that gives a slightly different perspective:<br><br><a href="http://www.jonathanfields.com/blog/the-truth-about-vizualization-and-goal-achievement/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.jonathanfields.com/blog/the-truth-about-vizualization-and-goal-achievement/</a></div>

<div class="content">So...combining Natalia and smileypete's articles...we should always start every task with these questions for maximum effect:<br><br>1. Will I do this?<br>2. If yes: How?<br><br>Correct?<br><br>And just in case these questions work, I've written them on Post-Its using nice big letters using a black felt tip pen and posted them all around my room, so I don't forget...<br><br>>.<</div>

<div class="content">I'd be surprised - after a few days - if most people have either:<br><br>a) adopt he habit as a regular mode of thinking (particularly during anxious moments)<br>b) are more productive that pre-linguistic trick<br><br>I'm still convinced that Barbara Sher's "Success Teams" or some variation thereof, are the best tools to increase honesty, accountability and soothe fear. However I've found in-person to be far superior to telephone/skype/email meetings. <br><br>Tomorrow afternoon I'm meeting with a good friend to begin this process.</div>

<div class="content">Success Teams is Sher's way to make goals happen. Once you've decide to start ( will I = yes ) Sher suggests rounding up supporters to encourage and help you succeed. Some of these may help you with the How question.</div>

<div class="content">I am hesitant to adopt a system that relies on supporters.  not to be cynical but people are mostly self absorbed or negative toward others goals because of jealousy.  Many people do not want to take risks and so do not want to see others succeed as it may make them feel bad.  It takes a lot, but being self motivated I find works better.<br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://www.desiredoutcomes.info" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.desiredoutcomes.info</a></div>

<div class="content">Gerry,<br><br>I take your point but suggest that it depends on personality.  Some people thrive working with others in support groups ... it clearly works ... for them.  Others do best on their own.  I'm one of the latter.  I don't want to have to justify my decisions to others.  That will not work for me.  But that is just me.</div>

<div class="content">Mike,<br><br>I was just speaking from my perspective, if someone has a true support system they trust I am sure it can work.  I am just so used to relying only on myself and teaching this philosophy, but other ways can certainly work/<br><br>Gerry<br><a href="http://desiredoutcomes.info" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://desiredoutcomes.info</a></div>
