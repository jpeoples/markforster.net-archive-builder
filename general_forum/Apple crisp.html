<div class="content">True story: Two weeks ago I bought some Macintosh apples for eating. They weren't getting eaten fast enough, so I wrote "apple crisp!" but I didn't feel like doing so then. Some days later, as the apples were just starting to rot, I saw the idea and put it into action. Chopped, mixed, set to bake on a timer and completely forgot about it as I went off to do other things. An hour later, I passed by the words "apple crisp" on my list. The dish was still warm!<br><br>Without my list, I would have had rotten apples. Or on a good week, cold apple crisp. <br><br>New on my list: locate a better recipe.</div>

<div class="content">This is why my attempts to cultivate a tea-drinking habit never last very long: I find the cold, bitter teacup three hours later. Timers help, and morning checklists, but eventually they become too oppressive for a simple cup of tea, and I give it up.</div>

<div class="content">I have that one mastered! Pour water in kettle, turn it on, fill the water purifier, run it, put tea leaves in the tea ball, grab my mug, add tea ball and sugar.  At that exact moment the water starts boiling, so I pour it in the cup, and take it to my desk.</div>

<div class="content">Not bad. My trouble ensues as it sits on the desk.<br><br>See, a regular drink is no problem, since I begin drinking it immediately. With tea, however, I begin some work while it brews, and soon it's three hours later.</div>

<div class="content">Bernie:<br><br>The simple answer to that is to use tea bags with tea bag tongs <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Faringdon-13cm-Tea-Bag-Tongs/dp/B0000BVEPE" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Faringdon-13cm-Tea-Bag-Tongs/dp/B0000BVEPE</a><br><br>Put tea bag in cup of boiling water. Squeeze with tongs until it's the strength you like, and remove. Add milk/lemon/whatever. Drink.<br><br>No need to brew.</div>

I aso feel like letting go of the outcome completely: no timers, checklists, etc. to make it into an über-production; if I dump it out three hours later, no harm done, and I'll try again tomorrow.<br><br>I will think of it as experiment, wondering what will happen. I'm curious to find out!<br><br>(... and all this from apple crisp?!)</div>

So much more convenient than brewing it myself.   With a hotpot, I don't even need to heat up a kettle.   And it's very good quality for an instant coffee.   Pricey if you buy it at the store, but pretty good if you buy it on Amazon.</div>

<div class="content">The easiest way not to forget to drink your tea is to drink proper tea, not some disgusting de-caffeinated substitute (the sort of thing they used as ersatz tea during wartime rationing).<br><br>The need for the caffeine kick will prevent you from forgetting it if nothing else does.</div>

<div class="content">I see. Good thing I did not mention the occasional shot of club soda or lime juice!<br><br>My grocer will feel relieved to hear about all this, because the blissfully ignorant fool has wasted decades, profitably selling truckloads of improper tea.  ;)<br><br>As for the caffeine kick, I've personally never felt it much, except when I drink something too late in the day and find it hard to sleep. I spent my first thirty-five years free of any caffeine habit whatsoever, including all my grad-school/silicon-valley all-nighters which proceeded without even a diet Coke (or an apple crisp, just to pretend that we are still on topic!). When I do take on a coffee/tea/energy-drink habit, it tends to implode after a year or two, when I no longer have a taste for the stuff at all, as if my body wants to kick all the caffeine out.<br><br>Caffeine or no, I am paying for all those all-nighters now, in symptoms of chronic sleep deprivation!</div>

If you make yourself real tea, you won't forget to drink it.</div>

<div class="content"><<I stand by my earlier comment. If you make yourself real tea, you won't forget to drink it.>><br><br>And I stand by mine: "Much" of my tea is decaf.<br><br>That's "much," a vaguely sizable chunk ranking below "all" and "most," in this case somewhere between half and two-thirds, leaving plenty of room for the caffeinated greens, blacks, greys, and even whites. Those varieties fare no better, partly because they are especially bitter when over-brewed, and now apparently because they don't "kick" me the way everyone else reports. Am I unkickable?<br><br>But thanks to this discussion, I now know how to beat the system!<br><br>I shall discard caffeine entirely and take up nicotine, whose potent kick I will surely be unable to dodge. Not a penny will be wasted, not a cigarette unsmoked, not a petard unhoisted-with!</div>

<div class="content">Bernie:<br><br>Alternatively you could try an "If... then" goal as described by Halvorson in "Success". I am finding they are very effective.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks, Mark. I just reread parts of Alan's thread "If S happens, I will R" about this book. It sounds like a worthwhile read.<br><br>Perhaps it will soon become my "book of the moment" in my Final Version notebook?</div>

<div class="content">Bernie:<br><br>I'm still reading it - it's a background read for me rather than a "book of the moment". Like a lot of these books, most of the useful stuff can be summed up in a few sentences (as Alan has done).<br><br>My books of course are an exception to this!</div>
