<div class="content">Mark, when I first read your announcement that you had found the "Best Time Management system I've ever used", and then said you had no plans to write a book on it, but would instead make it free and readily available, I was quite staggered.<br><br>I urge you to write a book on it - even if it's a small book, or a pamphlet - and claim your rightful dues from the system before it enters the public domain and is lost to you for ever. If it's very short you could still sell it as a PDF download on Amazon or similar sites. A brilliant Time Management system is like the Holy Grail. Please don't be like Professor Rubik! You'll regret it. <br><br>Also, I think if you worked on it as a book, more aspects and ideas and fine-tuning would become apparent to you in the making and so it would naturally expand anyway. One of the things I *really* loved in your other books was the way you showed full examples in real time from you working life, and even showed how you got on track when things went awry! That was fascinating. I would love to read the same thing, but with you working in AF. <br><br>Mark, I strongly urge you to take AF down from the site *immediately*, until you have it copyrighted. I've gained so much pleasure from your three books that I'd hate to see you unrewarded similarly with a system as good as AF.<br><br>Does anyone agree? <br></div>

<div class="content">It is not in the public domain. It is copyrighted like everything else on this site. Publishing it on the site establishes copyright. See the notice at the bottom of the page.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark<br><br>It may be copyrighted but that would not stop it from being copied and distributed freely - virtually anything can be obtained it you want it.  Obviously we all want to be able to trust everyone - unfortunately it's not a perfect world.  How about at least creating a "member's only" area for access - that could even be a subscription based member's only area? (Which of course would start you off on the path to making your furtune with AF!) :-)</div>

<div class="content">Sorry, I'm probably not using the right terms in the right places. What I mean is that the AF system is now freely available - which means everyone and anyone can print it, copy-and-paste it wherever they like, or send links to it wherever they like. In that respect the copyright doesn't mean much at all - practically no-one in the virtual world respects copyright. And once it has reached enough people in this way, it starts to become less valuable to you if and when you decide to market it or publish it as a book. <br><br>I'd just hate to see you losing out on any potential royalties, that's all I meant. You should be rewarded wherever possible for your great work. I'm certainly very grateful for it!</div>

<div class="content">I admit that questions related to this concern (anything can be copyrighted, but how many people can afford the cost to PROTECT their copyright?) was the reason for my question in the other thread. (Also, how many people want the hassle of protecting their copyright?) <br><br>I agree with Christine, that it would be a great idea to *at least* create a "member's only" area for access ... that way the subscription list (even if it is for free) could become part of the asset base for AF ... or as Christine puts it, "your fortune" ! :o)<br><br>AF is a valuable piece of intellectual property ... would really like Mark to get his  due from it. <br><br>Although maybe Mark wants both a balance of "payment" in both material and non-material (fame, legacy) rewards from this, and so that is why he wants to make it freely available in its basic form?<br><br>Mark, I AM very interested/curious as to why you want to make AF freely available?</div>

<div class="content">Christine:<br><br>I've made it quite clear that I intend to make the basic system available free of charge. That does not constitute putting it into the public domain. The copyright remains with me. <br><br>Writing a book or an ebook about it, or putting it on a members only area does not add or subtract from the copyright in any way - nor for that matter make it any less likely that people will copy it.</div>

<div class="content">Apologies - I think the confusion in this thread comes from my incorrect use of the term 'Public Domain' in the title and in my original post. The title of the thread would have been better put as 'AF Freely Available - A Mistake?'</div>

<div class="content">Personally I applaud you, Mark, for releasing details of your new system.  Calls of "Keep X secret or protect it so that you can maximise the money you make from it!" where X is something that could help, improve the lives of or be appreciated by many, many people all over the world strike me as very self-centred.  If you choose to release your ideas to the world, then good for you!  You are helping to make the world a better place.<br><br>Besides, even if you do want to generate significant revenue from your system, publicising it freely will make it vastly more popular and widely-spread than keeping it hidden in a members-only area.  And we have seen time and time again that taking this route does not preclude making good money (e.g., Monty Python, Radiohead, etc.).  Sticking with the "do things the way we've always done them, protect everything draconically, inconvenience our genuine customers hugely and sue everyone in sight" business plan (e.g., RIAA, MPIAA, et al) may well be the route to self-destruction.</div>

<div class="content">Richard:<br><br>Thanks. Your summing up of the marketing advantages is precisely my thinking.</div>

<div class="content">Hi Mark<br><br>I think it is fantastic that so many of us have been able to be a part of the beta testing of AF, and learning for ourselves the way in which it works - something that is virtually impossible to convey in a list of instructions.  I think it is great that you are making AF freely available; there is no doubt that it will be of great benefit to many, many people, and when you asked "How can I make pots of money out of AF?" I think we all realise that you mean by means of add-ons etc. I think the concerns expressed are people's concerns that you do not lose your intellectual rights.  Unfortunately nothing will stop people from copying it if they wish to but the ability to access the system primarily from one source - which is also be the support base for "the product" - will definitely help to maintain it's integrity. <br><br>There is a perception that everything should be charged for in life - but there is so much more to life than money.  If I had a pound for every time I'd been told I was stupid for "giving away" my time, help or ideas I would have been able to retire long ago, but the satisfaction of helping others is worth far, far more.  Inevitably that approach means that there will always be some that take advantage but in my opinion the rewards are worth so much more. At the end of the day I would rather approach things from that viewpoint, maintain my integrity, and if I get taken advantage of so be it.  I will fight to the nth degree though to try to stop someone else being taken advantage of ... :-)<br><br>Mark I think we all see in your desire to help people, a genuine spirit of generosity and a real integrity and I am sure that I can speak for all of the posters to this forum when I say how much we appreciate that, and the level of input you give.  That is very unusual in today's society.  I am sure also that anything we can do to assist you in promoting AF (and wherever possible helping you to keep those accountants happy!) we will do gladly.<br><br>Thanks again Mark</div>

<div class="content">Hi, you might want to consider releasing the basic system under a creative commons/non-commercial no derivatives license, see here:<br><a href="http://creativecommons.org/" rel="nofollow">http://creativecommons.org/</a> for more information.<br>This would allow you to freely allow redistribution of your work, while prohibiting others from commercializing it without your consent.</div>

<div class="content">While I have tried GTD and purchased the book, I had never heard of you Mark.  Sorry.  If I hadn't seen the post on Lifehacker you'd still be unknown to me.  So by shrewdly putting your system in plain view - if not public domain - you have brought people (and customers) into the fold that would never have been here any other way.  In a sense the buzz you'll get will likely wildly outstrip the profits from a pamphlet (and please do not write a 300 page book for a system this elegantly simple!).  DIT sales will pick up, your consulting business will accelerate, Autofocus will be refined by free labor (us - the masses) the website will flourish etc.  So, I applaud your good business sense and look forward to the future.</div>

<div class="content">Thank you, Subhan. That's a good suggestion, and I'd considered a creative commons licence. However for the moment I've kept it all rights reserved until I decide exactly what direction I am going to go with all this.</div>

<div class="content">I agree with Don, I now want to know more about Mark Forster, and give him money (well, that last bit is an exaggeration, but put it this way, I'd like to give him 10 times more that i give google (ok, still a zero sum, but only for now).</div>
