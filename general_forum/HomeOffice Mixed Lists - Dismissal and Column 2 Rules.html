<div class="content">I have one list for home and office tasks (since I can do a lot of tasks at both places). I see two possible treatments here when it comes to dismissal/column 2 block (I mean the rule that all tasks in column 2 have to be actioned) due to the problem of "wrong place" (not be able to action the task because I am at the wrong place):<br><br>1) ignorance: I simply pretend that the "wrong place" task does not exist. Consequence: I have unactioned column 2 tasks on more than two pages.<br>2) push forward: At least for column 2 tasks - if I remember correctly - Mark recommends to cross the "wrong place" task out and put it on next page's column 2<br><br>What do you think? Mark, may I ask why you recommend method 2 (you might have tried both)?<br>Have a nice Sunday!</div>

<div class="content">Hi Christian:<br><br>I've been with AF since the very first beta test in late December 2008, so I'be tried most of the variants and many of the tips on this forum.<br><br>I used to have one list, but have found that it's better for me to focus on separate lists.  A recent post by me on this was answered very sensibly by Mark when I wrote that I wanted to keep the Work list on the current, fee-earning work only, and the Personal/Home list for personal/home AND future work tasks.<br><br>As Mark wrote: Current Work (CW) and Everything Else (EE).<br><br>However, as you state, some tasks can not only be done at either place, sometimes they just have to be done in any place, ending up in C2 most of the time presumably.<br><br>When I review the day at home, I look at the EE list to see what can be done and should be done during work hours the next day.  I will transfer these tasks from EE to CW.<br><br>Likewise, at the end of the CW day, I may add urgent CW tasks to the EE list for that same day.<br><br>I think one can do this when the circumstances require it, it's practical and a way of getting things done.  That is what you mean in 2) above?</div>

<div class="content">Christian G:<br><br><< Mark, may I ask why you recommend method 2 (you might have tried both)? >><br><br>It's simple. It's so that the tasks are always in the current page's Column 2 so that when you become able to do them you can get on with it straight away.<br><br>If you use your method 1, they will have been left behind on a previous page and will have to wait.</div>

<div class="content">I was trying an experiment with "work" and "personal" pages interspersed in one SF book.  During "work" time, if I came to a "personal" page, I might cherry-pick an easy item or two -- especially urgent personal phone calls and the like, that needed to be during work hours anyway -- but otherwise I would not apply any SF rules.   And likewise for work pages during personal time. <br><br>It worked OK, but there was always a loss of momentum -- the Column 2 effect seemed to get diluted whenever I switched from work to personal or vice-versa.  <br><br>Late last week, I decided to try something new:  write all tasks in one notebook with no regard for whether they are work or personal, and follow all the rules at all times.   This has worked pretty well -- especially when following Mark's rule of copying forward any Column 2 items that physically cannot be done.   I count some things in this category such as any lengthy personal projects that would seriously interfere with my work if I undertook them during business hours -- it's actually physically possible but completely contrary to my obligation to my employer.  <br><br>In Column 1, I am writing work items from the top of the page, going down; and personal items, from the bottom of the page, going up, and then drawing a heavy line where they meet in the middle.   This one mechanic is similar to the "stalagmite/stalactite" method that many of us used for the AF1-4.  However, the approach I am taking right now is that I am writing it this way just to get a visual cue of whether something is "work" or "personal" and to sort of group things together.  And that's the ONLY purpose.    I am NOT using this stalagmite/stalactite method for dismissal.  (We used to dismiss work items only during work hours and personal items only during personal time -- we would not dismiss any of the personal items during work time, nor any of the work items during personal time.)<br><br>I decided instead to follow all the SF rules absolutely strictly.  This means that if I dismiss the tasks in Column 1 for any reason during work time, then I dismiss ALL the tasks in Column 1, including personal tasks.   It's only Column 2 items that get "moved forward" if they can't "physically" or "morally" be done right now.<br><br>Essentially this is just standard SF, exactly what Mark does himself, except I make the visual distinction between work and personal.  The reason I am elaborating on it so much is that I've experimented with (and struggled with) many different ways to handle "work" and "personal" tasks in my "corporate job but work from home most of the time" situation.  And I've finally come full circle back to the original rules as written.<br><br>There's at least one reason why it seems to be working pretty well over the last few days.  I have lots of personal commitments, but they tend to pile up because my work can be very demanding.  The problem with keeping the work and personal separated is that my personal tasks tend to grow and grow and grow.  They always far outnumber my work tasks.   I realized that a big reason for this is that I wouldn't dismiss any of those items unless I was on "personal time" -- and that just didn't happen often enough to make much progress on those items.  During the start-up phase (regardless of the system), I'd keep up pretty well, but eventually the backlog would just grow and grow -- I'd keep adding new personal tasks, but never have the time to let the system process them.<br><br>Combining everything into one list, and allowing the system to dismiss things aggressively if needed, works really well because it gives me a more realistic idea of how much actual personal time I have to commit to all these personal tasks.  It makes me realize that if I want to keep up with all my personal commitments, I need to work more "reasonable" hours, improve my health, or find some other way to have more time for them.  Or, finally concede that I can't do all of these things and seriously scale back.<br><br>Anyway, just some thoughts...  I'll let you know how it works out over the next few weeks.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the report, Seraphim.<br><br>As a matter of interest, how many active pages do you have at the moment?</div>

<div class="content">This is really intriguing.  I do not work out of my home, so I am not sure this would work well for me, but I am still intrigued by the thought of combining all into one notebook.  Hmmm....<br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">Mark - 12 active pages (9 personal, 3 work).  Work pages was maintaining a constant level, but personal kept growing.  Now that I've stopped making the distinction between work and personal pages, I'm hoping the total will start to decrease as I get on top of the personal items (most likely through a lot of dismissal!)</div>

<div class="content">Seraphim: I am with David in finding your method intriguing, and in fact very attractive. I find myself in exactly the same situation as you.  Work commitments that are few but heavy, and personal commitments that can be plentiful, but are more often than not light.<br><br>At the moment, the twain don't meet (personal's at front, work's at the back of the notebook) but I can certainly see how your method provides both the visual cue as well as the balance one needs between the two worlds.</div>

<div class="content">Mark, regarding column 2 I understand your argument for alternative 2 ("push forward"). What do you recommend for column 1 dismissal and why? Alternative 1 ("ignorance") or strict dismissal as described by Seraphim?</div>

<div class="content">I don't understand the question, Christian.  What's unclear about dismissal?</div>

<div class="content">@seraphim enlightening report. I am waiting for your next report. <br>I am always afraid to dismiss and that may be the reason I am blocked now. I should dismiss without thinking too much, and this would become a way to measure what I can do and what I finally can't or don't.<br><br>I may try your method and tread my few but heavy work tasks as big tasks (like the War and peace) that would follow me on the C2 most of the time (but I wouldn't like having to rewrite and rewrite them once I go back home... dilemma)</div>
