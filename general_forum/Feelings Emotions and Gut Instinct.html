<div class="content">Rainer<br><br>As requested here are my ramblings on Feelings and Gut Instinct ...........<br><br>This post follows a few comments regarding items standing out and the concept of an item "feeling right" as an emotional response and gut instinct.  It actually made me realise that for me there is a slight difference between the two and it made me question firstly what that difference was and secondly, and more importantly perhaps, whether it mattered in this context.  To answer the second question first I don't think it makes any difference in the AF context as to whether the item stands out by a feeling (emotion) or by gut instinct.  The important thing is to recognise the item standing out.  What I realised though when I thought about gut instinct is that, for me at least, it is somehow stronger than the "feel like" emotion. The conclusion I reached was that, and again I am speaking personally here, it somehow related to the importance of the item and the apparent logicality or otherwise of my decision to act upon it.  I have touched on this in another post.<br><br>It is as if, when reviewing a list of tasks that my sub-conscious has somehow determined have equal priority, then it is absolutely fine to "just do what I feel like".  However, sometimes my logical mind kicks in and says "nooooo this, or that, is far more important and MUST be done now".  Sometimes I can just stop, make a conscious decision to "trust the system" and carry on with what I "feel" like doing, but sometimes my logical mind is shouting so loudly that something more is needed.  It is then that I have to look at the Common Sense option and make a decision to go with my "feeling" or to use the Common Sense rule.  At the start of using AF I would have imagined that it was obvious - just use the Common Sense rule.  However I have found a strange thing - there have been a couple of instances where I believed I should use the Common Sense approach but my gut instinct has been to do something else.  Specifically I had two tasks that were time intensive, had a fixed deadline,  were essential and important.  In short they had to be done!  AF was telling me not to worry about them - at the beginning I was ok with that, expecting them to stand out later.  As the deadline got closer I became more anxious - they weren't standing out, except in the completion of small parts towards them.  Time went on and I was faced with a dilemma - use the Common Sense rule and time blocks to complete them, or "trust the system".  Everything told me to use the Common Sense rule  but my gut instinct (which was more than just a feeling) was that I should trust the system. <br><br>In practice I stuck with my gut instinct - on one task I not only met the deadline with time to spare but with a complete absence of stress, and with a new system in place to ensure that the task itself will never become an issue for the future.  The second task, was even more interesting.  I realised that the approach I had been using was wrong - completely relooked at the way I was approaching the task, changed systems and put new systems into place, completed a large part of the task by the deadline, found that I could defer part of it and consciously decided to do so as an informed and "correct" decision.   In all honesty I don't think I could recommend that approach to others without a LOT of thinking through the implications  - the conscious decision to go with that level of gut feeling is not a comfortable experience and I think is something I have learned to recognise from past experience rather than "just doing it".  It is something I have experienced in the past when making major decisions that seem to go against common sense and it is hard.  The rewards may be amazing but the common sense option is always safer!  I guess we just have to do our own risk assessment in those cases. :-)  <br></div>

<div class="content">Hey miss Moneypenny, thanks for posting!<br><br>Very interesting the discernment between feeling, gut feeling, common sense and its application to AF. I remember reading about some difference between the gut feelings of men vs women, in terms of literally feeling it in the 'gut' or elsewhere in the body. <br><br>I think one point of interest is the feelings that are fear or survival oriented and that silent calm voice that seems to speak from a wiser perspective without really alarming you to it. I think it's that subtle silent 'voice' that would work really well in AF terms, with the right amount of trust. <br><br><br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Peter<br><br>Interesting that there are differences in the "gut instinct" of men & women - I was curious so did a bit of surfing and found this artiocle which was interesting<br><br><a href="http://searchengineland.com/human-hardware-men-and-women-13614" rel="nofollow">http://searchengineland.com/human-hardware-men-and-women-13614</a><br><br>I like the way you put it when you identify the feelings as fear or survival oriented vs the subtle silent voice.  It's not easy trying to describe a "feeling"</div>

<div class="content">Christine,<br><br>thanks for your thoughts. Unfortunately I can't give them the attention they deserve today. But I will reply to you on Friday, <br>I promise (it's on my list.)<br><br>Btw, for a long time I suspected that there must be a difference between women and men, but I didn't know that it's in their heads.  :-)<br></div>

<div class="content">Christine:<br><br>I've certainly found that trusting the system works, and it's now very rarely that I use the "common sense" rule. There have been occasions when I've tried to shortcut the system and the result has always been an increase in resistance and procrastination - usually resulting in the "urgent" items getting done even slower!</div>

<div class="content">Rainer<br><br>Oh, you must mean the point in the article above that women use all of their brains where men only use half of them :-) Quote "At the risk of oversimplification, it appears that women engage more of their brains when they think." <br><br>Actually the article (link above) is very interesting.  And I can read a map but do turn it upside down when necessary! It just seems obvious ..........</div>

<div class="content">Mark<br><br>That's really helpful to know. I've certainly been noticing an increase in resistance and procrastination when I try to push "the obvious items".  I think I will still have to do that to some degree as I have a significant backlog but even the fact that a few "new" backlogs have arisen over the past week has been a learning opportunity as I more readily question the importance or necessity of those things in my life. <br><br>My biggest problem is paper - and specifically dealing with my post.  When I could outsource that to a PA my life always felt on track ...........<br></div>

<div class="content">Christine<br><br>You wrote:<br>“… I don't think it makes any difference in the AF context as to whether the item stands out by a feeling (emotion) or by gut instinct. The important thing is to recognise the item standing out. What I realised though when I thought about gut instinct is that, for me at least, it is somehow stronger than the "feel like" emotion.”<br><br>With this I concur completely. It’s the same here with me.<br><br>Then you wrote about “common sense” and the “feeling” conflicting against each other. You came up with the solution to stick with your gut instinct, trusted your system and thus solved the problems of the two tasks. <br><br>With AF I haven’t had this conflict yet. Hope things will stay this way. <br><br>But during the times when I used GTD as my system I experienced several similar situations where I didn’t trust my next-actions lists. It was then when I felt drawn to two different directions: Either trust my next-actons list (the system) or trust my logic (common sense) to block out time to work on something more important.<br>Usually I followed logic (use time blocks). Okay, I always managed to get the work done, but only with a lot of overtime, grinding and stress. <br><br>The AF methode makes it far easier for me to trust my system. One reason for this might be the fact that I am still building up my lists organically, slowly, step by step, whithout the GTD compulsion to make a decision on everything as soon as it shows up. Maybe it was that compulsion that made me sometimes avoid my lists.<br><br>But I have encountered another situation with AF I would like to describe.<br>One of my first items on my AF list was an old stalled project that I thought would be a good candidate for testing this new AF methode. After several days of no progress I dismissed it (about three weeks ago). A few days ago while driving to work I had an idea about this old project and I saw what has been missing: We had neglected an important aspect of the project’s scope! And the old project could be divided into several new independent tasks and the neglected part would be one of those new tasks. The scales fell from my eyes and I decided to restart working on that new group of tasks. The issue now feels more “balanced” to me.<br><br>Because I was rather puzzled by this happening to me, I tried to give some thought on what “balance” means to me.<br><br>Working in balance to me consists of three parts: control, influence, and learning.<br>This means to know what I am able to control (if I try: my thoughts, my behavior), for what I have a potential to influence (e.g. my feelings, parts of my environment, my relationships), and what I should appreciate and learn from, and then act according to this knowledge, attempting to control only what I am able to control, strive to influence what I am able to influence, and appreciate what I’ve got and learn as much as I can (esp. from my opponents). <br><br>The problem with that old stalled project was that the way we at work are used to handle certain types of problems is fully formalized, using certain templates. In case that a problem doesn’t fit completely into this approach then some aspects of the problem are neglected in order to get our work done. In other words, we try to control what we can’t control, at least not with the tools we use.<br><br>Well, I hope I have learnt something out of this, and, Christine, I hope these musings  make any sense to you.<br></div>

<div class="content">Hi Rainer<br><br>I literally had just 15 minutes of discretionary time (in which amazingly I have already checked for an email I was waiting for and dealt with it by means of a phone call) so have only just had time to read your post but not enough time to respond.  You raise some interesting points which I am going to think over - will reply later!</div>

<div class="content">Hi again Rainer<br><br>Your post raised some interesting ideas - I think the amazing thing about AF is that it DOES enable us to explore what is really going on with us in our tasks, projects, and in a way our wish for control. Generally speaking we never take the time to really examine what we do or why we do it - we "just do it".  We may look at the difficulties we have with "just doing it" but never actually really question the things we are trying to "just do".<br><br>For example, we have our to do list, or our project list, and our normal approach is to say "this is what I have to do, now how do I do it".  We recognise that we find some things difficult to "fit in" or that we procrastinate on certain tasks but we assume it is because we either do not have enough time or are just naturally hopeless procrastinators that "can never get anything done". In actual fact, in probably 99% of the cases that is not the issue; we have exactly the same amount of time as anyone else and we are not all a bunch of totally useless specimens who can't be bothered to anything productive but who would rather watch TV all day instead. <br><br>I think what AF highlights better than any other system I have come across is that, actually, there are other reasons.  Quite frankly how many of us really take the time to look at what we are doing (to the level of detail that AF enables us to assess) and ask why we are doing it, should we be doing it, or is there a better way.  Who would consider thinking about why they don't like stacking the dishwasher - the thought of even thinking about it seems not just pretty silly but totally ridiculous!  But all of these little niggly dislikes build up 'til we have a whole host of stuff that we "just hate doing" .....  and of course we just accept that that is part of life.  How many of remember being told "well, we all have to do things we don't want to ......."  So there you are - that is obviously a "fact of life" and we've probably been told that too.  Of course a fact of life is a fact  ....isn't it?<br><br>By working with our intuition as opposed to our logic, AF doesn't just come up with weird and wonderful ideas - all it does is just to enable us to recognise what we instinctively knew all along.  The trouble is that conventional wisdom says otherwise.  We know we don't like doing certain things - we know that we are not stupid - we know other people are not fighting with the same things we are but still our rational mind says "everyone has told me this is a fact of life therefore it must be me that is wrong".  It is as if AF for the first time gives us permission to say "hang on a minute, who's to say it's me (intuition) that's wrong" and allows us to actually debate the issue rather than give in without even thinking of a fight.<br><br>I think it is important to clarify "why" you should trust the system with AF - I think that reason is very different to trusting other systems.  For example, you mentioned trusting the system with GTD (or not) vs trusting the common sense approach of time blocks.  The thing with that is that both options were effectively logical (rational) options, created maybe in a different way, but still coming from a logical perspective.  There may be a gut feeling to do one or the other but either method can be justified from a rational perspective. With AF, trusting the system is so much more nebulous, in that we cannot rationalise the "gut feeling" that says "do this" or "don't do this".  It is only once we "trust the system" and act on what "the system" or gut instinct is telling us to do or to leave, that the reasoning becomes clear, because it is only then that we have, if you like, given our sub-conscious permission to speak.   You have obviously seen this in action with your old project - by allowing the system to dismiss the item, your sub-conscious eventually pointed out in no uncertain terms why it was not going to action the task as written, and enabled you to acknowledge even the possibility of an alternative course of action.  I think half the time our sub-conscious would never have bothered to speak because it knew we wouldn't listen!.<br><br>Moving on to your comments about balance and the three parts you mention;  I certainly don't disagree with what you say but I think there is actually another part as well.  The three areas you mention are all very valid - I do believe that it is essential to have an understanding as to what we can control, and/or influence, and to be continually learning, which in itself will have an impact of our levels of control and/or influence and manage the way in which we do so.  However I think the other factor is beyond just learning itself but involves looking at whether our assessments themselves are actually correct - this is where our conscious vs subconscious comes into play, and where AF wins over other systems.  Control, influence and learning are all to an extent rational - I know this therefore I can do that - I have this set of tasks and the ability to do them, therefore I have control - I have learnt the system therefore can influence the outcome or achieve a specific objective ...... However there has also to be that element that cannot be rationally determined - that intuition, gut instinct whatever, but that element of action that by it's very nature becomes qualitative as opposed to quantitive - the learning that is not in how much more I know but in an instinctive ability to question "why" as opposed to accepting what is - "Why is it done this way?" "Why does it need to be done". <br><br>It is strange, but I have mentioned before that AF has identified the fact that I don't like being told what to do, or when to do something, and I think that in some way this is one of the keys.  I think that within all of us there is this element of instinct, intuition, creativity, but that the accepted patterns of learning and behaviour stifle that.  If you think of a young child - the one thing they are always asking is "why?".  Think of any statement and just add why to it - and you have a sense of the curiosity and wonder of a child - "the sky is blue" - "why?", "put your toys away" - "why?", "time for bed" "why?".  As those questions got either progressively harder to answer, or progressively more irritating to our parents, the answer was more likely to be "because I said so", or in adult life, if we ever dare to question a system or procedure, "because it's always been done that way".  The desire to question may have been squashed by "accepted wisdom" but not I believe the ability to question.  It may take a while for us to have the courage to try again, or we might be a bit rusty, but I believe that desire to question - that thirst for real knowledge based on a need for understanding as opposed to just knowledge for knowledge's sake - is the key to us really "growing up".<br><br>Does this make any sort of sense?  It continues to amaze me how AF does somehow give the mind permission to start questioning again - and to rediscover that genuine "joy of learning".  In another post Mark mentioned reading The Thirty Nine Steps which started an interesting discussion.  I vividly remember reading that book, not because of the story itself, but because it was the first school text that totally grabbed me.  Every term we had Dickens, or other classics, and the reading assignments were pure drudgery, and exercise in how something was written, what the author meant etc.  When the Thirty Nine was the chosen text I just devoured it - I read it as a story, living the adventure with the character, rather than having to trudge through two chapters homework reading.  Similarly I vividly remember two specific school projects where I must have spent hours researching because they somehow grabbed my attention.  In a way they took me out of homework (must do) mode to hobby (want to do) mode and there was no struggle whatsoever in fulfilling those assignments (tasks).  I'm sure we've all experienced those times in our life when something has grabbed our attention and we just want to know more and more - THAT is what life should be like, not the drudgery of tasks that we have somehow created - and that is what AF seems to be providing the ability to achieve.  <br><br>    <br>  <br><br></div>
