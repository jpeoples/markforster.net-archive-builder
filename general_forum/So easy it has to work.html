<div class="content">Hi Mark!<br><br>Today I just got started -and I love it :)<br>Mostly because its not too far off from my old system and doesn't waste much time itself.<br>I first thought: "What about my call at 10?" Till i figured: Well, that's in Outlook anyway.<br>So the system helps you to get everything organized that ISNT ALREADY.<br>I'll probably have to adjust my list a bit like separate work from the private stuff. But that's hard to do for me in life also ;)<br>And the first task on my list is to translate your instructions into German.<br><br>Oh, now I can complete my first task :)<br><br>Simone</div>

<div class="content">Hi Simone,<br><br>I'm interested in seeing your German version (and any German forum that may ensue). My native language is English, but I live in Germany and speak German every day (and as a translator I constantly flip between the 2 languages).<br>On another note, it seems that my starting point is not quite as good as yours. I am a chronic "non-note-taker", so your comment about things that are already organised does not quite fit my situation. For example, I have 5 translation jobs that must be delivered this week. In this case I have them all listed, but I am not always that well structured. So if I am going to get started on a new system, it needs to include some way of listing and handling deadline tasks (and allowing for deadline tasks that come in at short notice and gatecrash any list of non-priority tasks that may be around).<br></div>

<div class="content">Simone and Victor:<br><br>I would certainly appreciate a German translation, and it would be even more valuable if one person has produced it and another vetted it.<br><br></div>

<div class="content">Simone:<br><br>It's not so much whether something is already organised, it's whether it has to take place at a specific time. Something like an appointment is time specific, and therefore would be handled through your schedule, not through your list of tasks.<br><br>On the other hand, preparation for the appointment and follow-up afterwards most definitely can be handled through the system.</div>

<div class="content">Victor:<br><br>This question of deadline tasks is exactly where the Autofocus system shines. If you put all the tasks into the system it will sift them so that the right priority is given to each. At least that's what I've found to be the case. It's much better at allocating priorities than my rational mind is on its own!</div>

<div class="content">Mark:<br>Yes, you are right.<br>Just that in my life organised means more something like "out of my head". So for me Autofocus gives my old "To-do list" a new .. well, a system at all.<br><br>Btw: also on the list "write a program for Autofocus"<br><br>Victor:<br>Uh, now it's gonna take me even longer, with a pro checking it :)<br>But it's in the system and I've already started.</div>
