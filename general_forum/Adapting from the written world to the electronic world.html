<div class="content">I've been quite pleased thus far with using DIT, and keeping a simple small journal to mark off the days' activities.  Unfortunately I'm going to a workplace that relies heavily on MS Outlook.  Not looking forward to making the transition, but am required to track my work this way so that my supervisors can see my calendar, as well as co-workers.  Any suggestions on making the transition?</div>

<div class="content">Use Outlook tasks<br><br>Setup:<br>--------<br>Table view<br>Allow editing in table<br>Show columns<br>  completed checkbox<br>  current task (user defined yes/no) Or use a category flag.<br>  Subject<br>  Start date<br>Sort by "modified date"<br>Filter by "completed" ="No" (optional. You can set other views)<br>group by "start" (low to high)<br><br>Operate:<br>----------<br>Start at the current flagged task<br>When you have finished, either<br> - click the "completed" checkbox OR<br> - tab to the start date and type d or now<br> - unflag the current flag if it is still live<br>Cycle through the group, clicking on each task subject until you see one to do (then flag it current and do it, as above)<br><br>To enter a task, type subject, tab to start date, type "d" for tomorrow's date or "now" for today's date.<br>At the start of the day, type the line and "now"<br><br>Works fine. Much simpler than it looks</div>

<div class="content">Though I see no reason why you can't keep your task diary going. Perhaps I'm missing something here.</div>

<div class="content">Will-thanks, I will give it a run.  I could hypothetically keep my task diary going, but the tide at my workplace seems to be turning-everything is integrated into Outlook, accessed by smartphones, etc.  It just makes sense in my position to put it all in one spot instead of worrying about parallel systems or keeping some items in task diary, some on Outlook.</div>

<div class="content">I have to maintain my calendar in Outlook 2007 as this is a university-wide system and makes scheduling meetings with multiple people so much easier.  However, I maintain my tasks and projects in a simple, spiral-bound notebook and am very productive with Autofocus 1.  <br><br>Sigh...it is hard to continue at times with paper and pen in our digital world.  <br><br>-David</div>

<div class="content">I agree David-I'm in a similar spot and haven't "bought in" to the use of all of this technology that appears to make life easier.  Something comforting about having a piece of paper I can hold onto.</div>
