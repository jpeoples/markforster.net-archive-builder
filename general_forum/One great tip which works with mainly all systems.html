<div class="content">Hello<br><br>I love MF systems and especially use (AF), (AF4) and FV. I have discovered a way to go a head when I am stuck on a task. It often happen. If I am reluctant to do something I simply report it at the end of the list and put a cross after the item ie X. <br><br>More there are XXX more the item is urgent or important. So after 2 XX I stop and block a period of time to do something on it whatever...<br><br>Then if something is left I reformulate the item and put it at the end of the list<br><br>The result since 6 month is great. I made many good things with this tip and wanted to share it with you.</div>

<div class="content">Other tip clean once a day my list and keep only what you decide to really work on. If you decide to keep the non actionable or the tikler items or the someday may be items keep them in a specific list. I use for this a Mulberry binder with tabs but you can also use filofax or whatever ...<br><br>This is gordgious it me me work faster. I read the non actionable items once a day in the evening most of the time. <br><br>I would be happy if you also give yours tips you have discovered thanks.</div>
