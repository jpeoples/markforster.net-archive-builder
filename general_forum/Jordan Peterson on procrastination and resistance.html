<div class="content">That is a great booklet Connor, thanks!  Change your environment OR make small changes OR forget about it, no other method works.</div>

<div class="content">I wish BJ Fogg would write a longer book, but it might be too late. JKames Clear's book Atomic Habits takes most of tiny habits and builds on it. He emphasizes anticipation and satisfaction.<br><br>https://s3.amazonaws.com/jamesclear/Atomic+Habits/Habits+Cheat+Sheet.pdf<br><br>Dopamine goes up when you anticipate, not when you do. An effective reward when you finish the habit increases the anticipation. He also says dopamine is the anticipation chemical, not happiness or motivation as is commonly said. He also has a short (2 page!) cheat sheet to help find <br><br>There's still room for a book on BJ Fogg's behaviour grid, but it looks like he's not working on it anymore. https://www.behaviorgrid.org/</div>

<div class="content">Re: B J Fogg<br><br>This is a neat little production. The recommendations are very plausible, and it's good to know they've got the authority of a senior researcher behind them – even though they're all familiar. <br><br>But God, the man's annoying. His examples would be more persuasive if he could just step outside the self-centred obsessions of a California academic. Not everyone is preoccupied with how they can eat more kale, or do more running. Yes, they're just examples – except that all his examples are like that. <br><br>And yes, going to live on a remote farm in Panama is just an example of the effect of environment on our behaviour – but he so obviously thinks that there's something morally fine about it. But he hasn't done it himself for the same reason most of us haven't - because scraping the dirt in Panama all the daylight hours and then falling into bed exhausted isn't compatible with doing our real work.<br><br>Sorry. Repeated mentions of health food just set me off.<br><br>Chris</div>

<div class="content">Thanks Seraphim for sharing this video. I was thinking about it recently and experimented with lightly scheduling my day again.<br><br>Jordan Peterson's attitude is to schedule a day you want to have, not one that overwhelms you. (Your not your own tyrant) Find what you are willing to do and schedule nothing more than that.<br><br>BJ Fogg's insight is realizing there is power in feeling successful. His Tiny Habit's method makes you celebrate after a small behavior.<br><br>So my little experiment is to schedule my time with behaviors I want to do and I believe will be successful. Similar to what Peterson was doing in the video, I think in the morning of what I would be willing to do today. If there is ever a doubt that I may not be successful I schedule less.</div>
