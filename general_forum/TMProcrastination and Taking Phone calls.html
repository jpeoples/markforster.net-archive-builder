<div class="content">Greetings to all. <br><slightly off topic><br>I have A request of the readership:<br>Recently, I read an article that I believe was a link from a thread here that dealt with tips on time management.  In the article It talked about minimizing procrastination by taking that dreaded phone call-- The one that when you see the caller ID, you consider sending it directly to voicemail.  The suggestion was that by taking the call, you minimize the work necessary to return the call later, and any procrastination that might go into that.  I believe that the article had several other tips, and for the life of me I cant find it.  I've checked my browsing histories, and such, all with no luck.  <br><br>I've been a regular reader of Mark's work since well, since the early early days.  Mark's discussion boards and articles are just about the only one I check religiously.  I thought and maybe hoped that if this triggers a memory of someone, that they might post the link, or point me in the right direction to find this elusive article.  This article may not be on this site, but... i think it might be on a site that one of the regular post-ers may have offered as an outside resource.    or, as regular consumers of /thinkers on time management type stuff, perhaps one of you know of the article independently. <br><br>Sorry if this is too off topic, but the readers/posters here are the absolute best.  I have learned and grown soooo much from what is contained within these boards.  I appreciate everyone's enthusiasm and wisdom. <br><br>with gratitude, <br>Mary</div>

<div class="content">Well, I have just googled this: <a href="http://happiness-project.com/happiness_project/2011/10/why-you-shouldnt-let-that-dreaded-call-go-to-voicemail/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://happiness-project.com/happiness_project/2011/10/why-you-shouldnt-let-that-dreaded-call-go-to-voicemail/</a> . Can it be what you asked for?</div>

<div class="content">It's surprising how often two different people get different results using the same tools.  I'm the computer guy at our house, but I often can't find something on the internet and ask my wife to look.  She always finds what I'm looking for; many times on her first search.  She doesn't even have to understand my question to come up with the answer.</div>
