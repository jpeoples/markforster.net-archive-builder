<div class="content">“How do you become more productive?”<br><br>Richard Branson leaned back and thought for a second. The tropical sounds of his private oasis, Necker Island, murmured in the background. Twenty people sat around him at rapt attention, wondering what a billionaire’s answer would be to one of the big questions—perhaps the biggest question—of business. The group had been assembled by marketing impresario Joe Polish to brainstorm growth options for Richard’s philanthropic Virgin Unite. It was one of his many new ambitious projects. Virgin Group already had more than 300 companies, more than 50,000 employees, and $25 billion per year in revenue. In other words, Branson had personally built an empire larger than the GDP of some developing countries.<br><br>Then he broke the silence:<br><br>“Work out.”<br><br>He was serious and elaborated: working out gave him at least four additional hours of productive time every day.<br><br>The cool breeze punctuated his answer like an exclamation point.<br><br>From <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2010/12/06/four-hour-body-review/" target="new" rel="nofollow">http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2010/12/06/four-hour-body-review/</a></div>

<div class="content">I believe it.  I've been working out hard for only 3 weeks, but I'm definitely more alert and less tired than I used to be.</div>

<div class="content">Sorry, that's not quite right!<br>"Working hard" usually means going to the office and doing important things.<br>"Working out" means going to the gym and building muscle.<br><br>Branson says if you want to work effectively you must work out.  If you just "work hard" but don't stay fit you'll be too tired.</div>

<div class="content">As a Woody Allen-esque character myself, working-out is a cure-all for any neurotic symptom. IMHO, it trumps meditation and all other forms mood enhancing techniques.</div>

<div class="content">Avrum: a video of Woody Allen doing a workout would be interesting and possibly hilarious!<br><br>You're right about its effects, a bit like long distance running (which I hated except when I came to the end of the run) or a hard game of squash (described by Henry Kissnger - another candidiate for a fitness video - as 'chess played inside a sauna').</div>
