<div class="content">Seraphim:<br><br>Thank you very much for this. It's good to get the blog back again, complete with log-in and comments now. So I've got to get back into the habit of replying to comments and writing blog posts. <br><br>And for those who are wondering... I'm currently using NQ-FVP. Excellent for establishing routines.<br><br>There are still a few things missing, like the ability to edit the right-hand margin, and as that includes the "To think about" section, here's quote to ponder from "Predicitably Irrational" by Dan Ariely:<br><br>- "A hungry donkey approaches a barn one day looking for hay and discovers two haystacks of identical size at the two opposite sides of the barn. The donkey stands in the middle of the barn between the two haystacks, not knowing which to select. Hours go by, but he still can't make up his mind. Unable to decide, the donkey eventually dies of starvation."</div>

<div class="content">Merry Christmas, Mark; thank you for the lovely post, Seraphim. Nice to see you back, Mark, and I look forward to your insights. For me, I'm back with AF1. I would also add that resistance zero was incredible as well. I didn't think I'd like it at all. I might go back to it, but I was preselecting too many tasks, and I never got to the older ones. I think AF1 is still the best, I enjoyed reading the older posts when you first introduced it. Exciting times.</div>

<div class="content">Reply from ChatGPT:<br><br>Thank you for the lovely Christmas message, Seraphim! It's always a joy to celebrate the holiday season with loved ones and to reflect on the many blessings we have received throughout the year. I hope you and your family have a wonderful Christmas filled with love, joy, and all the things that make this time of year special. Wishing you a very Merry Christmas and all the best in the coming year!<br><br>(Will it write blog posts as well?)</div>
